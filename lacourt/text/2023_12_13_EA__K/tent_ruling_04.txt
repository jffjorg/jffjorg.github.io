On September 27, 2023, the court related Case Nos. BC700926
and 23PSCV02834 and deemed Case No. BC700926 to be the lead case.
A Case Management Conference and a Status Conference Re:
Related Cases are set for January 31, 2024.
Legal Standard
A
demurrer may be made on the grounds that there is another action pending
between the same parties on the same cause of action and/or that the pleading, inter
alia, does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subds. (c) and (e).)
When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of
the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A
demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the
pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 [citations omitted].) At the pleading stage, a
plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant
of the factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) “[A] demurrer
does not, however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law
alleged in the pleading, or the construction placed on an instrument pleaded
therein, or facts impossible in law, or allegations contrary to facts of which
a court may take judicial knowledge.” (S.
Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 [citations
omitted].)
Discussion
BFA demurs, per Code
of Civil Procedure § 430.10, to the entirety of Plaintiff’s complaint.
Request for Judicial
Notice
The court rules on
BFA’s Request for Judicial Notice as follows:
1.                 
Grant
as to Exhibit A (i.e., complaint filed April 5, 2018 in case styled Rideau v. Smart & Final LLC, et al., Case No. BC700926 [“Action I”]); 
2.                 
Granted
as to Exhibit B (i.e., “Plaintiff Oscar Rideau’s Notice of Motion and Motion
for Leave to File his First Amended Complaint” filed June 27, 2023 in Action
I); 
3.                 
Granted
as to Exhibit C (i.e., August 9, 2023 minute order in Action I); and, 
4.                 
Granted
as to request to take judicial notice of the court’s entire docket in Action I.
Merits
At the outset, the court declines Plaintiff’s request to
stay this action pending the outcome of Plaintiff’s writ filed in Case No.
BC700926.
BFA first asserts that Plaintiff’s complaint should be
sustained in its entirety, on the basis that it is a sham pleading designed to
circumvent the court’s prior order in BC700926.
The sham pleading doctrine is not applicable here. “Under the
sham pleading doctrine, plaintiffs are precluded from amending complaints to
omit harmful allegations, without explanation, from previous complaints to
avoid attacks raised in demurrers or motions for summary judgment.” (Deveny
v. Entropin, Inc. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 408, 425; see also Colapinto v.
County of Riverside (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 147, 151 [“If a party files an
amended complaint and attempts to avoid the defects of the original complaint
by either omitting facts which made the previous complaint defective or by
adding facts inconsistent with those of previous pleadings, the court may take
judicial notice of prior pleadings and may disregard any inconsistent
allegations”]. )
BFA cites to Larson v. UHS of Rancho Springs, Inc.
(2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 336 in support of its statement that the sham pleading
doctrine “applies not only to an amended pleading filed in the same action, but
also to the first pleading filed in a separate action.” In Larson the
plaintiff filed an initial complaint for medical negligence, professional
negligence, battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. (Id.
at 340). Plaintiff thereafter filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) which
dropped the claims for medical negligence and professional negligence, but alleged
claims for assault, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
(Id. at 341). Defendants demurred to the FAC, which the trial court
sustained with leave to amend on the bass that plaintiff failed to allege
sufficient facts to show he did not consent to the anesthesiologist’s conduct
because his alleged injuries occurred when the anesthesiologist provided
medical care. (Id.)
Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice
(rather than amend his pleading) and, eight months later, filed a second
action, asserting claims for battery and intentional infliction of emotional
distress, but omitting many of the specific facts he alleged in the first
action (including that defendant Shuman was the anesthesiologist on plaintiff’s
kidney stone surgery and that plaintiff’s alleged injuries occurred as
defendant Shuman administered anesthesia for the surgery). (Id.)
The trial court in the second action sustained defendants’
subsequent demurrers without leave to amend on statute of limitations grounds.
(Id. at 342). The court of appeal determined, inter alia, that the trial
court properly considered plaintiff’s complaints from the earlier action in
considering whether plaintiff’s claims were based on professional negligence
(and thus governed by the one-year statute of limitations espoused in Code of
Civil Procedure § 340.5, rather than the two-year limitations in § 335.1
applicable to personal injury claims), stating that “[plaintiff] is bound by
the allegations of his complaints in the Earlier Action because he omitted
facts the trial court relied on in sustaining [Defendants’] earlier demurrers
without providing an explanation for the omissions. The trial court therefore
properly considered the allegations from [plaintiff’s] earlier complaints
when ruling on the demurrers in this action.”
The issue in Larson, then, was whether plaintiff
attempted to circumvent the court’s ruling on defendants’ demurrer to
plaintiff’s FAC in the first action by dismissing the first action and
subsequently filing a second action which omitted facts previously plead in the
first action, without explanation. The instant case does not involve a scenario
where Plaintiff, in an attempt to avoid a demurrer, pled facts or positions in
the instant complaint that contradict the facts or positions that Plaintiff pled
in the first action or suppressed facts that prove the pleaded facts false. The
sham pleading doctrine is inapplicable.
Next, BFA contends that the court should sustain its demurrer
to Plaintiff’s entire complaint and stay the action on the basis that there is
another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action. “A
plea in abatement pursuant to section 430.10, subdivision (c), may be made by
demurrer or answer when there is another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action.” (Plant Insulation Co. v.
Fibreboard Corp. (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 781, 787.) “[W]here the court
determines there is another action pending raising substantially the same
issues between the same parties, it is to enter the interlocutory judgment
specified in Code of Civil Procedure section 597.[1]”
(Leadford v. Leadford (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 571, 574 [emphasis added].) “Abatement
of the second action is a matter of right. A trial court has no discretion to
allow the second action to proceed if it finds the first involves substantially
the same controversy between the same parties.” (Id.)
“In determining whether the causes of action are the same for
purposes of pleas in abatement, the rule is that such a plea may be maintained
only where a judgment in the first action would be a complete bar to the second
action.” (Plant Insulation, supra, 224 Cal.App.3d at 787.)  “Causes of action are considered the same if
based on the same primary right.” (Citizens for Open Government v. City of
Lodi (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 296, 325.) “[U]nder the primary rights theory,
the determinative factor is the harm suffered. When two actions involving the
same parties seek compensation for the same harm, they generally involve the
same primary right.” (Boeken v. Philip Morris USA, Inc. (2010) 48 Cal.4th
788, 798.)
Here, a comparison of the complaint in this instant case and
the complaint in Case No. BC700926 (RJN, Exh. A) reflects that the cases
involve the same issues, parties and injury allegations. Plaintiff concedes
that the cases “derive from the same set of fact[s] and the same parties.”
(Opp., 3:18-19). The only difference between the two actions is this action
includes a claim for products liability whereas Case No. BC700926 involves
claims for premises liability and general negligence. However, the same primary
right—Plaintiff’s right to freedom from bodily injury—is involved in both
actions.
Plaintiff’s contention that abatement is moot since the two
actions have been related ignores that fact that the two actions are separate
lawsuits.
The court, then, sustains BFA’s demurrer on the basis of Code
of Civil Procedure § 430.10, subdivision (c) and will enter an interlocutory
judgment pursuant to section 597.
