And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling denies the motion to enforce a subpoena served on the Veterinary Medical Board for production of business records. The Plaintiffs, Paul K. Schrieffer and Norma N. Schrieffer, seek to enforce the subpoena, which was objected to by the Board on the basis that it fails to meet notice to consumer requirements, commands the production of documents that are not business records, seeks documents privileged by Evidence Code § 1040 and/or Civil Code § 47, and violates consumer privacy rights. The court finds that the Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of showing good cause for the subpoena, as they have not identified a disputed fact that is of consequence in the action and explained how the discovery sought will tend to prove or disprove that fact or lead to other evidence that will tend to prove or disprove the fact.
