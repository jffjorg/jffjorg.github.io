The judge has granted the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff, Jose Luis Cortes. The defendant had alleged that the plaintiff had failed to comply with a court order to provide discovery responses and pay monetary sanctions. The court found that the plaintiff had abandoned his case and that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules or court orders. The court granted the defendant's motion, imposing terminating sanctions on the plaintiff.
