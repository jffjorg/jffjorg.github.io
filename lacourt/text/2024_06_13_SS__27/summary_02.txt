And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for terminating sanctions, evidentiary sanctions, and monetary sanctions filed by the defendant. The plaintiff failed to appear for a court-ordered deposition and failed to pay monetary sanctions of $600. The court finds that plaintiff's violation of the court order was not willful and that terminating sanctions, evidentiary sanctions, or issue sanctions are not appropriate at this time. However, the court grants monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,500 to compensate the defendant for having to file the motion and incur attorney's fees. The court orders plaintiff to pay the sanctions within 30 days.
