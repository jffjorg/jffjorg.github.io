CASE NO./NAME: 20STCV21873 NEOME VELASQUEZ
vs WHOLE FOODS MARKET GROUP
Moving Party: Defendants La Caze Development
Company and Rolling Hills Plaza
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient
Ruling: MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL IS GRANTED 
 
On June 10, 2020,
Plaintiff filed the present trip and fall case. On March 9, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a Doe Amendment adding LA CAZE DEVELOPMENT COMPANY as a named Defendant.
On March 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Doe Amendment adding ROLLING HILLS PLAZA
LLC as a named Defendant.
On April 24, 2024, LA
CAZE filed and served its Motion for Summary Judgment. The earliest date LA
CAZE was able to reserve for the MSJ hearing was March 28, 2025. On May 7,
2024, ROLLING HILLS filed and served its Motion for Summary Judgment. The
earliest date ROLLING HILLS was able to reserve for its MSJ hearing was March
13, 2025.
The current trial date
is set for January 21, 2025. Defendants move the Court to continue the trial
date to sometime in May 2025, so the MSJs can be heard at least 30 days before
trial.
"A trial court may not refuse to hear a
summary judgment filed within the time limits of [Code of Civil Procedure]
section 437c. [Citation.] Local rules and practices may not be applied so as to
prevent the filing and hearing of such a motion." (Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529); accord First
State Inc. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 324, 330 (invalidating
case management order to the extent it precluded filing motions pursuant to
section 437c.) Continuing trial so the MSJ can be heard constitutes good cause.
Thus, the motion is GRANTED.
The new Trial Date is set for May 5, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. The
Final Status Conference is continued to April __, 2025, at 10:00 a.m.
All case-related deadlines will follow the new trial date.
