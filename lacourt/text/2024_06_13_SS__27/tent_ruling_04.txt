MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL 
Hearing Date: 6/13/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV28222 NORMA GALLARDO
GARCIA vs CITY OF INGLEWOOD
Moving Party: Defendant City of Inglewood
Responding Party: Plaintiff
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL IS GRANTED 
 
On August 30, 2022, Plaintiff filed the
present trip and fall case. On May 8, 2024, Defendant City of Inglewood filed
its motion for summary judgment with a hearing date set for February 21, 2025.
The current trial date is set for August 27, 2024. Defendant moves the Court to
continue the trial so the motion for summary judgment can be heard 30 days
before the trial date.
"A trial
court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment filed within the time limits of
[Code of Civil Procedure] section 437c. [Citation.] Local rules and practices
may not be applied so as to prevent the filing and hearing of such a
motion." (Sentry Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526,
529); accord, First State Inc. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 79
Cal.App.4th 324, 330 [invalidating case management order to the extent it
precluded filing motions pursuant to section 437c].) 
Continuing the
trial so the MSJ can be heard constitutes good cause. Plaintiff, in her opposition,
argues that the MSJ was not timely filed; however, this is not true. A motion
for summary judgment is timely when it is filed 105 days before trial (75 days
before the hearing and 30 days before trial (CCP § 437c(a).)) Here, the MSJ was
filed on May 8, 2024, and the trial is set for August 27, 2024, with 111 days
in between. Thus, the MSJ is timely, and the present motion is GRANTED.
The new Trial
Date is set for May __, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. The Final Status
Conference is continued to May__, 2025, at 10:00
a.m. The only basis for Defendant’s request for continuance of the trial is so
that its MSJ can be heard, and Defendant did not discuss any of the factors to
reopen discovery. Thus, fact discovery does not follow the new trial date.
Should a party or the parties wish to reopen discovery, the Court will consider
a motion or a stipulation filed for that purpose.
