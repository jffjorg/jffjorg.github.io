Ruling:
MOTIONS TO COMPEL FURTHER AND REQUESTS FOR SANCTIONS ARE DENIED.
On March 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed
motions to compel further responses to her Requests for Admission, Set One, No.
23 and Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos 5 and 6. 
Personal
Injury Hub Courts will not entertain Motions to Compel Further Discovery
Responses until the parties have participated in an Informal Discovery
Conference (IDC). (Eighth Amended Standing Order For Procedures In The Personal
Injury Hub Court at p. 7.) The Court may either deny or continue a Motion to
Compel Further Responses to discovery if the parties do not schedule and
complete an IDC prior to the hearing date set for a Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Discovery. (Id.) The
parties are required to participate in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC)
to attempt to resolve any outstanding discovery disputes before a motion to
compel further can be heard. No IDC has been held or scheduled prior to the
hearing or filing of the present motion, Thus the present motions and requests
for sanctions are denied without prejudice.
