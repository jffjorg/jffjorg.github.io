SANCTIONS AND MONETARY SANCTIONS

CASE NO./NAME: 21STCV08955 MARY GHERMEZIAN vs
INPALA, INC.
Moving Party: Defendant Inpala
Responding Party: Plaintiff¿ 
Notice: Sufficient¿ 
Ruling: TERMINATING AND EVIDENTIARY SANCTIONS
DENIED; MONETARY SANCTIONS GRANTED
 
On March 8, 2021,
Plaintiff filed the present trip and fall case. On February 14, 2024, the Court
ordered Plaintiff to appear for deposition and to pay monetary sanctions of
$600 within 20 days. The parties met and conferred, and Plaintiff’s deposition
was scheduled for March 14, 2024. Plaintiff failed to appear for her
court-ordered deposition on March 14, 2024, and failed to pay the monetary
sanctions of $600 within the twenty days as ordered by the Court.
Defendant Inpala, Inc.
now moves for terminating sanctions, or in the alternative, evidence sanctions
against Plaintiff on grounds that Plaintiff willfully failed to appear for her
court-ordered deposition on March 14, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition
stating that $600 has since been paid, and the March 14, 2024 deposition had to
be rescheduled due to a calendaring conflict, but has since been rescheduled.
The parties do not
dispute that the violation of the court order at issue here is Plaintiff's
failure to pay $600 and to sit for her deposition within 20 days of February
14, 2024. Defendant does not allege that Plaintiff violated any other court
order. The Court notes that Plaintiff filed an opposition stating that
Plaintiff has since paid the $600 in sanctions and rescheduled the deposition.
Plaintiff contends that she intends to participate in discovery. Given the general
incremental approach to sanctions (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract
Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604), and the
principle that sanctions are to be imposed not to punish but to obtain
compliance (Newland v. Superior Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613), the
Court does not find terminating sanctions, evidentiary sanctions, or issue
sanctions to be appropriate at this time. However, Plaintiff did violate the
Court’s February 14, 2024, orders as the sanctions were not paid and Plaintiff
did not sit for her deposition within 20 days of February 14, 2024. The Court
orders monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,500 against Plaintiff and her
counsel, jointly and severally, to compensate Defendant for having to file the
present motion and incur attorney’s fees to induce compliance. (Defendant
offered to reschedule the deposition only after the present motion was filed.)
Plaintiff is ordered to pay Defendant the ordered sanctions within 30 days of
today.
