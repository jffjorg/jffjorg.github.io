And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's request for default judgment against the Defendants, without prejudice. The Plaintiff, Venice Home Construction LLC, is seeking a default judgment in the amount of $322,544.15, which includes special damages, prejudgment interest, and costs. However, the Judge has ruled that the Plaintiff has not demonstrated entitlement to the requested damages, as the Complaint does not specify the amount of damages sought. Additionally, the Judge has determined that the Plaintiff's request for prejudgment interest is not valid, as the Plaintiff has not provided an interest computation. The Judge has also denied the Plaintiff's request for costs, as the Plaintiff has not demonstrated entitlement to the requested amounts. The Judge has ordered the Plaintiff to seek judgment separately against the Defendants for the alleged back rent and property damage, and for the value of the fraudulent conveyance.
