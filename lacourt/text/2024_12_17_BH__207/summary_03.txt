And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by Haig B. Kazandjian, counsel for plaintiff Juan Farrow, to be relieved as counsel. The motion is unopposed. The judge notes that at the original hearing, the court indicated an intent to deny the motion without prejudice due to procedural deficiencies, including the lack of proof of service and a declaration that did not adequately convey that counsel confirmed the client's service address within the past 30 days. The court granted counsel an opportunity to correct these deficiencies.

Counsel filed a declaration indicating a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship and a breakdown in communications. The judge finds that the motion complies with the Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1.16(b)(4). However, the judge notes that counsel still failed to provide proof of service of the required documents on the client.

The judge continues the hearing on the motion to February 25, 2025, to enable counsel to correct the procedural deficiencies. Counsel is also required to file a proof of service on or before February 18, 2025, establishing service of the notice of the continued hearing on all parties, including the client, and service of the required documents on the client.
