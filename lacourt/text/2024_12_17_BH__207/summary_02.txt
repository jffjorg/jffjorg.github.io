And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the County's motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend. The case arises from a hole in the sidewalk created by a planter, which allegedly caused the Plaintiff, Ashley Rochestie, to fall and sustain injuries. The Plaintiff filed suit against the City of Santa Monica, Los Angeles County, and others, but the City's demurrer was previously sustained without leave to amend. The County now moves for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the Plaintiff failed to timely submit a claim to the County and did not demonstrate satisfaction of the prefiling claim requirement.

The Judge concludes that the Plaintiff has not alleged or demonstrated satisfaction of the prefiling claim requirement as to the County, and that the Plaintiff has failed to meet the burden of showing how the complaint could be amended to state a cause of action. The Court also notes that the Plaintiff's previous attempts to amend the complaint were denied, and that the Plaintiff has not demonstrated a basis for leave to amend.

Accordingly, the Judge grants the County's motion for judgment on the pleadings, and the Plaintiff is not allowed to amend the complaint. The County is ordered to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
