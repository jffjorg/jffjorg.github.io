MATTER
  


Request
  for Default Judgment



 
Plaintiff Venice Home Construction LLC (“Plaintiff”) requests for
default judgment against Defendants AML Associates LLC, Pablo Roskell and
Macias Abraham (“Defendants”) in the amount of $322,544.15,
which is composed of special damages in the amount of $281,266.13; prejudgment
interest in the amount of $40,379.02; and costs in the amount of $899.
 
            a.         Damages 
 
            Plaintiff’s
Complaint alleges eight causes of action for (1) Breach of Rental Agreement;
(2) Trespass; (3) Common Counts; (4) Common Counts on Quantum Meruit; (5)
Negligence; (6) Waste; (7) Fraudulent Transfer; and (8) Conspiracy.  Plaintiff’s Complaint was originally brought
against Defendants Pablo Roskell, AML Associates LLC, and Macias Abraham.  On June 8, 2023, Plaintiff added Defendant
Bettencourtmacias Charan via Doe amendment. 
Defendant Charan was dismissed via oral motion on December 12,
2023.  Defendant AML was personally
served with the summons and complaint on June 12, 2023 and on February 22, Defendants
Roskell and Abraham were served via publication as ordered by the Court on December
5, 2023. Default was entered against Defendant AML on September 14, 2023, and
against Defendants Roskell and Abraham on May 1, 2024.  The remaining Doe defendants 2-10 were
dismissed on April 14, 2023. 
 
            Plaintiff’s
Complaint does not specify the damages sought. 
(See Compl.)  The Court cannot
award damages that are in excess of what is pled in the Complaint. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 580, subd. (a) [“The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is
no answer, cannot exceed that demanded in the complaint”]; Levine v.
Smith (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 1131,
1136-1137 [“when recovering damages in a default judgment, the plaintiff is
limited to the damages specified in the complaint”].)  Therefore, because the Complaint does not
specify the amount of damages sought, Defendants were not on notice of their
potential liability when default was entered, and the Court cannot grant
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment in any amount, on the current
Complaint.
 
            Moreover, Plaintiff appears to
include past due rent amounts and sanctions awarded in connection with two
prior unlawful detainer cases.  (See
Compl. ¶¶ 5, 12, 21 [prior unlawful detainer cases]; ¶¶ 22, 25 [sanctions]; Goudarzi
Decl. ¶ 7 [“According to the ledger, Tenants owe $298,516.13 back rent”]; ¶ 27
[“After completion of the unlawful detainer trial, on March 21, 2023, Plaintiff
obtained a judgment for possession and $25,000 for damages […] the court also
granted $5,252.14 costs and $375 attorney’s fees.”]; ¶ 28 [“Plaintiff has not
been able to collect either one of its judgments”].)  The Court cannot enter a judgment that
includes amounts that were already awarded.
 
            In a supplemental declaration Ms.
Goudarzi clarifies that the $281,266.13 in damages sought represents
$245,516.13 in back rent + $35,750 in damages Plaintiff caused to the
property.  (Goudarzi Decl. ¶¶ 7, 9-16, 18-23.)
The back rent amount sought represents $298,516.13 in back rent owed as
indicated on the ledger - $28,000 security deposit - $25,000 awarded in
connection with the limited civil unlawful detainer case.  (Ibid.)  
 
            Goudarzi raises the issue of
sanctions to demonstrate that Defendant Abraham, who is not a party to the
lease agreement, conspired with Defendant Roskell to fraudulently transfer
title of his vehicle to Abraham to prevent Plaintiff from collecting on the
order for sanctions in the prior case.  (Goudarzi
Decl. ¶¶ 24-35.)  By this action,
Plaintiff seeks to levy the car, which is now in Abraham’s name, to satisfy the
prior judgment.
 
            Fraudulent transfers are
voidable.  (Nautilus, Inc. v. Yang
(2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 33, 39.)  As to
Defendant Abraham, Plaintiff alleges only the seventh and eighth causes of
action for fraudulent transfer and conspiracy [to commit fraudulent
transfer].  Thus, Plaintiff has not
alleged, much less established that Abraham is responsible for the back rent or
the damages to the property.  As such, the
default judgment Plaintiff seeks against Rockwell and Abraham, jointly and
severally, is improper.  Rather,
Plaintiff must seek judgement against Rockwell for the alleged back owed rent
and property damage, and Plaintiff must separately seek judgment against
Abraham for the value of the fraudulent conveyance.
 
            Therefore, the Court cannot award
Plaintiff the requested damages. 
 
b.         Prejudgment
Interest 
 
            Because
Plaintiff has not demonstrated entitlement to the requested damages, Plaintiff
has similarly not demonstrated entitlement to the requested prejudgment
interest on those damages.  Plaintiff has
not demonstrated entitlement to the requested damages, nor has Plaintiff
provided an interest computation. 
Therefore, the Court cannot award the requested interest.  

 
            c.         Costs 
 
            Plaintiff also requests $899 in costs composed of $439 in filing fees and $460 in “Other” fees, composed of “Skip
Trace and Publication.” (CIV-100.)  In
general, Plaintiff is entitled to costs as the prevailing party in this
action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)
 
            Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033.5 outlines costs that are allowable and not
allowable.  Plaintiff is entitled to
recover filing fees and publication fees, pursuant to subdivisions (a)(1) and
(4).  However, investigation costs are
expressly disallowed, pursuant to subdivision (b).  Therefore, Plaintiff is not entitled to
recover skip tracing costs.  
 
            Because the Court
cannot discern what portion of the $460 is for “publication” (and therefore
allowable) and what portion is for “skip trace” (which is not allowable), the
court cannot order the costs as requested.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s
request for default judgment is denied without prejudice.
