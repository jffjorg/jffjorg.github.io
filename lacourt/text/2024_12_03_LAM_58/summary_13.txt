And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment in this unlawful detainer action. The defendant had argued that the three-day notice to pay rent or quit was defective because it demanded more than 12 months of rent. However, the judge ruled that the COVID-19 Tenant Relief Act and Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) allow for the collection of more than 12 months of rent. The judge also sustained the objection to the defendant's evidence regarding a rent ledger and denied the motion for summary judgment.
