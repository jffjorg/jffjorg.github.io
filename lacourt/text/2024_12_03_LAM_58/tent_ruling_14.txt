[1] The reply argues that Plaintiffs’ opposition was not
properly served on Defendant because Plaintiffs did not comply with Code of
Civil Procedure section 1010.6. Defendant requests that the Court, therefore,
disregard the Opposition. Plaintiffs’ electronic Service appears to be
defective. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd. (c).) However, as Plaintiff could
serve the opposition at the time of the hearing, there appears to be no
prejudice to Defendant on the improper service. (Rules of Court, Rule 3.1351,
subd. (b).)
