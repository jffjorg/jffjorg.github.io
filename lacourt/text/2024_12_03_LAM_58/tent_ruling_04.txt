DISCUSSION 
 
            Plaintiff
requests entry of default judgment in the amount of $421,498.88, which includes
interest, costs, and attorney fees. 
 
According to Plaintiff’s evidence, Defendant
defaulted on the Note One Obligations to Plaintiff by, among other things,
failing to make the monthly payment due on October 1, 2022, and each payment
due thereafter; as a consequence of Defendant’s defaults on the Note One
Obligations, Plaintiff accelerated the entire outstanding balance due under the
Note One Documents as immediately due, owing and payable. (Kim Decl., ¶ 27.)
Despite demand by Plaintiff upon Defendant for the repayment of the unpaid
balance due under the Note One Documents, in accordance with the terms of said
Note One Documents, Defendant has failed, refused and neglected to pay any sum
pursuant thereto. (Kim Decl., ¶ 28.) 
 
On the Note One Obligations and
Note One Documents, Plaintiff requests the sum of $213,770.31, consisting of
the principal sum of $174,282.50, accrued unpaid interest in the sum of
$28,244.51, and accrued late charges in the sum of $6,608.54, and attorneys’
fees and costs in the sum of $4,634.76. (Kim Decl., ¶¶ 34-40.)
 
 
According to Plaintiff’s evidence, Defendant
also defaulted on the Note Two Obligations to Plaintiff by, among other things,
failing to make the monthly payment due on October 1, 2022, and each payment
due thereafter; as a consequence of Defendant’s defaults on the Note Two
Obligations, Plaintiff accelerated the entire outstanding balance due under the
Note Two Documents as immediately due, owing and payable. (Kim Decl., ¶ 29.)
Despite demand by Plaintiff upon Defendant for the repayment of the unpaid
balance due under the Note Two Documents, in accordance with the terms of said

            Plaintiff’s evidence supports its request for damages. (Kim v.
Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 288 [“ ‘[p]laintiffs
in a default judgment proceeding must prove they are entitled to the damages
claimed’ ”].) 
 
Additionally, the loan agreements
contain attorney fee provisions. Further, Plaintiff’s request for attorney fees
complies with LASC 3.214. (Kim Decl., ¶¶ 39, 49.)

original exhibits in compliance with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1806.
