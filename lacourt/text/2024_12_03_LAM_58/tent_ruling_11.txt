[1] The Complaint alleges “Plaintiffs are a reasonable consumer who
interacted with sales representatives, considered Defendant's advertisement,
and/or other marketing materials concerning the HONDA Vehicles prior to
purchasing the Subject Vehicle. Had HONDA revealed the Sensing Defect,
Plaintiffs would have been aware of it and would not have purchased the Subject
Vehicle.” (Compl., ¶ 58.) However, to the extent these allegations would
support an intentional fraudulent misrepresentation claim against Defendant
Honda, this claim fails for a lack of specificity as discussed in the case
authority cited below.

also demurs on the grounds that Plaintiffs’ fraudulent
concealment claim is barred by the economic loss rule. “The economic loss rule
requires a purchaser to recover in contract for purely economic loss due to
disappointed expectations, unless he can demonstrate harm above and beyond a
broken contractual promise.” (Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp.
(2004) 34 Cal. 4th 979, 988.) Economic losses include “damages for inadequate
value, the costs of repair or replacement, and any consequent lost profits.” (Jimenez
v. Superior Court (2002) 29 Cal.4th 473, 482.) The rule bars a plaintiff's
tort recovery of economic damages unless such damages are accompanied by some
form of physical harm (i.e., personal injury or property damage). (North
American Chemical Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 764, 777.)
One exception to the economic loss doctrine is “where the contract was
fraudulently induced” due to an affirmative misrepresentation. (Robinson,
34 Cal. 4th at 989–91 [citation omitted]; Rattagan v. Uber Techs, Inc.
(9th Cir. 2021) 19 F.4th 1188, 1191 [“In Robinson, the California
Supreme Court held that the economic loss rule does not bar fraud claims
premised on affirmative misrepresentations.”].) However, “[w]hether
California's economic loss rule bars fraudulent omissions claims based
on purely economic injury is unsettled.” (Anderson v. Apple Inc. (N.D.
Cal. 2020) 500 F. Supp. 3d 993, 1019 [emphasis added].) Then, in 2022, the
California Court of Appeal's decision in Dhital v. Nissan N. Am., Inc.
(2022) 84 Cal. App. 5th 828, 844,), review granted, 304 Cal.Rptr.3d 82,
523 P.3d 392 (2023) stated that “[t]he reasoning in Robinson
affirmatively places fraudulent inducement by concealment outside the coverage
of the economic loss rule.” (Id. at 840-841.) However, Dhital is
currently pending before the California Supreme Court, and thus has “no binding
or precedential effect, and may be cited for potentially persuasive value
only.” (Cal. R. Ct. 8.1115(e)(1).)
