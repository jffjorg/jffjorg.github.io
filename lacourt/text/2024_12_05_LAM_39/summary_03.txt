And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has made a tentative ruling on a motion to set aside default filed by Defendant Chantiste Beal. The default was entered in favor of Plaintiff Overhill Properties, Inc. after Defendant failed to respond to the summons. Defendant claims that she did not receive actual notice of the action, and has provided evidence to support this claim, including declarations from herself, Irma Martinez, and her family members, stating that she was having dinner at a different location at the time of service. In opposition, Plaintiff's counsel claims that he served Defendant by knocking on the door and attempting to hand her the summons, but Defendant did not receive it. The Court finds that Defendant's evidence is sufficient to demonstrate that she did not receive actual notice of the action, and therefore grants the motion to set aside default. The default is vacated, and Defendant is ordered to provide notice of this order and file proof of service.
