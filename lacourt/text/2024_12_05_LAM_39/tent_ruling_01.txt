CASE NUMBER:


22STCV40722




MOTION:  


Motion to Deem Admitted




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant the General Council of the Assemblies of God




OPPOSING PARTY:


Plaintiff John Doe #1 I.C.



 
MOTIONS
            Defendant,
the General Council of the Assemblies of God (“Defendant”), moves to deem
admitted matters specified in Requests for Admissions, set one (“RFA”), which Defendant
served on Plaintiff John Doe #1 I.C. (“Plaintiff”). 
ANALYSIS
When a party fails
to respond to requests for admissions, the propounding party may move for an
order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction.  (Code of Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (b).)  The Court “shall”
grant a motion to deem admitted the matters specified in the requests for
admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission
have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed
response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with
Section 2033.220.”  (Code of Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)  
After Defendant
filed this motion, Plaintiff served responses to the RFA.  Accordingly, the Court places the motion off
calendar as moot.  If Defendant is
dissatisfied with Plaintiff’s responses, Defendant must move to compel further
responses.  
Defendant is ordered to provide notice of
this order and to file proof of service of same.
