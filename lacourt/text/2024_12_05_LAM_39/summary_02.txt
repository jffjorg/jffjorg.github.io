As a result, section 437c is unforgiving; a failure to comply with any one of its myriad requirements is likely to be fatal to the offending party." - Brantley v. Pisaro (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1591, 1607
  - "The party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law[.] There is a triable issue of material fact if, and only if, the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof." - Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850

As for the summary of the tentative ruling, here is a brief summary in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, as the plaintiff has failed to meet its burden of showing that it will prevail on its claim for breach of contract. The plaintiff had alleged that the defendant, Health Access for All, Inc., failed to pay $42,000 for laboratory testing and related services rendered. However, the plaintiff's evidence failed to demonstrate that the defendant breached the contract, as the plaintiff's CEO, Sheila Busheri, only stated that the defendant failed to provide necessary information to permit the plaintiff to bill third-party payers for the services. The judge found that the plaintiff's evidence did not show that the defendant failed to provide sufficient information to permit the plaintiff to bill the responsible parties, and therefore, the plaintiff failed to meet its burden on summary judgment. As a result, the judge denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication.
