Motion
  to Set Aside Default




MOVING PARTIES


Defendant Chantiste Beal




OPPOSING PARTY


Plaintiff
  Overhill Properties, Inc.



 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Overhill
Properties, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) sued Defendant Chantiste Beal (“Defendant”) for
breach of commercial lease.  In its order
of May 1, 2024, the Court entered Defendant’s default.  Defendant moves to set aside the
default.  Plaintiff opposes the motion.   
DISCUSSION
Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473.5, the Court may vacate a default “[w]hen service of a summons has
not resulted in actual notice to a party in time to defend the action and a
default or default judgment has been entered against him.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5.)  The phrase “actual notice” means “genuine
knowledge of the party litigant” and does not include imputed notice. (Tunis
v. Barrow (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 1069, 1077.)  
Plaintiff
purportedly served Defendant by personal service on March 12, 2024 at 7:10 p.m.
at 12115 Second Avenue in Lynwood.  In support
of her motion, Defendant has submitted her own declaration, in which she states
she was not at that location at 7:10 p.m. on March 12, 2024. ”).  (See Declaration of Chantiste Beal, ¶¶ 7, 8.)
 Instead, Plaintiff asserts she was having
dinner with Irma Martinez (“Martinez”). 
(Id., ¶ 9.)  Defendant also
advances Martinez’s declaration, who affirms Defendant was with her having
dinner at 102 East Raymond Street in Compton at 7:10 p.m. on March 12,
2024.  (Declaration of Irma Martinez, ¶ 2.)  Defendant also provides declarations from
Cynthia Beal and Gerald Beal, who state they own the property at 12115 Second
Avenue in Lynwood and affirm Defendant was not present at that location on
March 12, 2024.  (See Declaration of
Cynthia Beal, ¶¶ 2, 6; Declaration of Gerard Beal, ¶¶ 2, 6.)  
In opposition,
Plaintiff points to the declaration of its counsel, Adam C. Nicolai
(“Nicolai”).  He states, “At
approximately 7:10 pm, I knocked a few times on the door with no answer, but as
I was leaving, a woman clearly fitting the description of [Defendant] drove up
into the driveway in her automobile. In fact, I recall that she was wearing
what appeared to be medical scrubs. She would not get out of her automobile and
attempted to ignore me, and she got on her phone and appeared to be talking on
it. I waved the Summons and Complaint and related lawsuit papers in front of her
and made a motion asking her to roll down her window. She refused, and then
started to back her car away. I dropped the Summons and Complaint and related
lawsuit papers on her windshield as she was backing away.”  (Declaration of Adam C. Nicolai, ¶ 8.)  Nicolai’s declaration does not demonstrate Plaintiff
validly served Defendant.  Moreover,
Nicolai does not state he clearly identified himself and informed the
individual he encountered he was serving process.  (Trujillo v. Trujillo (1945) 71 Cal.App.2d
257, 260.)   
The totality of Defendant’s
evidence is sufficient to demonstrate Defendant did not receive actual notice
of this action.  Accordingly, Plaintiff
fails to show relief from default is unwarranted. 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
The motion is
granted.  The Court vacates the default
taken against Defendant.  Defendant’s
proposed answer attached to her declaration as Exhibit A is deemed file and
served on this date.
Defendant is
ordered to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
