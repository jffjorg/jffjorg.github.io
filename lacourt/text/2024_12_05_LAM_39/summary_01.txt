And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, the General Council of the Assemblies of God, moves to deem admitted certain matters specified in Requests for Admissions (RFA) served on the plaintiff, John Doe #1 I.C. The plaintiff failed to respond to the RFA, and the defendant filed a motion to deem admitted. However, after the defendant filed the motion, the plaintiff served responses to the RFA, making the motion moot. The court orders the motion off the calendar and directs the defendant to provide notice of this order and file proof of service. If the defendant is dissatisfied with the plaintiff's responses, the defendant must move to compel further responses.
