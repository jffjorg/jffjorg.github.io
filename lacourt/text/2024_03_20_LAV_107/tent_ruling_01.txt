COURT’S [TENTATIVE]
  FINDINGS OF FACT AND STATEMENT OF DECISION
 
 



 
[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: 
 
     
I.        
INTRODUCTION
This is a motion made by
plaintiff seeking a declaration and order, pursuant to Corporations Code §7616,
that the October 2023 election for the Board of Directors of Annandale
Townhouse Association, Inc. is invalid. Plaintiff Douglas Kruschen (“Kruschen”)
is an individual owner and resident at a residential project
known as Annandale Townhouse
Association, Inc.. Kruschen was a Director and Officer of Annandale Townhouse
Association, Inc. at the time of the disputed election giving rise to this
litigation in October, 2023. Defendant Annandale Townhouse Association, Inc.
(“the Association”) is a seven-acre 292 separate interest unit nonprofit mutual
benefit corporation under the Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporation Law (Corp.
Code §7110 et seq.) and formed in 1973 a common interest development under the
Davis Stirling Common Interest Development Act (the “Davis-Stirling Act”) (Civ.
Code §4000 et seq.). Defendants Victor Martinez,
Anthony Wagner, James Grossman, Scott Perl, and Jeffery Atkinson ("Individual
Defendants") are the owners of separate units acting on behalf of the
Association. The Plaintiff claims the October 2023 election was a “debacle” and
gives several reasons, including the Association’s failure to properly
distribute election materials. provide access to election rules, comply with the
annual meeting notice obligation, facilitate member contact, and properly
notice election results. Additionally, plaintiff contends that the Association refused
to seek consent of Board nominees, and that ballots set forth wrong term
lengths, proxies were mishandled, the counting of ballots was done in an
unauthorized Zoom meeting, and that ballots were accepted after the close of
polls. The Plaintiff petitions this court for the issuance of orders that, inter
alia, a) void the 2023 election, b) reseat the prior board of directors, c)
direct Annandale to conduct a new election, d) impose civil penalties, and e)
award to Plaintiff his attorney fees as prevailing party.
 
Plaintiff filed a complaint on
November 20, 2023. A request for an expedited hearing pursuant to Corporations
Code section 7616(a) was granted by this court on December 1, 2023 and the
matter was set for hearing on January 4, 2024 by stipulation of the parties. On
January 2, 2024, at the request of the parties and by stipulation, the court
continued the hearing to February 27, 2024. 
 
The hearing proceeded as a
court evidentiary hearing on February 27, 2024, February 28, 2024, and February
29, 2024. The matter was reported each day by a certified shorthand reporter. Plaintiff
Douglas Kruschen was represented by attorney James Perero and Defendants
Annadale, Victor Martinez, Anthony Wagner, James Grossman, Scott Perl, and
Jeffery Atkinson a were represented by attorney Gerard Kilroy. Witnesses who
testified are reflected in the court’s minutes and include: Douglas Kruschen,
Doreen Murray, William Springer, Jennifer Campbell, and Michelle Kelly. 
 
During the evidentiary hearing pursuant
to Corporations Code section 7616(a), all parties were given the opportunity to
examine on direct, cross-examination, re-direct, and to reopen when requested

II.        
LEGAL STANDARD
California Civil Code §5145(a)
provides that, “A member of an association may bring a civil action for
declaratory or equitable relief for a violation of this article by the
association, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, restitution, or
a combination thereof, within one year of the date that the inspector or
inspectors of elections notifies the board and membership of the election
results or the cause of action accrues, whichever is later. If a member
establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the election procedures
of this article, or the adoption of and adherence to rules provided by Article
5 (commencing with Section 4340) of Chapter 3, were not followed, a court shall
void any results of the election unless the association establishes, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that the association's noncompliance with this
article or the election operating rules did not affect the results of the
election. The findings of the court shall be stated in writing as part of the
record.”
 
 III.        
PLAINTIFF’S SPECIFIC ALLEGATIONS RELATING TO
ELECTION PROCEDURES AND RULES NOT BEING FOLLOWED
At the trial pursuant to
Corporations Code section 7616(a), the Plaintiff asserted 10 separate
violations which he contends merit relief. (Originally, the plaintiff asserted
11 separate violations, but one was not pursued at the trial.) The court has
considered the following claims:
 
1.     “Failure
to properly distribute election materials. Pursuant to Civil Code §4040, the Association
was obligated to deliver election related materials to both he and his
non-party spouse as record holders of title. However, notices were delivered
only to Plaintiff's spouse at one of the designated addresses.”
2.     “Refusal
to seek consent of Board nominees. The Association's Election and Voting Rules
at Paragraph 7(c) authorized Plaintiff to nominate board candidates.
Recognizing that many potentially qualified candidates never otherwise
volunteer, Plaintiff caused the nomination of hundreds of Annandale members. No
rule precluded him from doing so. The Election and Voting Rules at Paragraph
7(d) required Annandale to contact the nominees to confirm their consent to
running for a director position. The Association refused to do so.”
3.     “Failure
to facilitate member contact. Pursuant to Civil Code §5225 and Corporations
Code §8330, Annandale was obligated to facilitate Plaintiff contacting all of
Annandale's members, which Plaintiff sought for campaign purposes. Annandale
failed to do so.”
4.     “Ballots
set forth wrong term lengths. The Association's Bylaws at Article IV, Section 5
require three-year director terms, but ballots distributed to members provided
for terms shorter than three years.”
5.     “Failure
to provide access to election rules. Pursuant to Civil Code §5105(h)(4), Annandale
was obligated to provide its members with access to its Election and Voting
Rules by (at a minimum) posting them to a website identified on the ballot.
Annandale failed to post its Election and Voting Rules to the indicated
website.”
6.     “Failure
to comply with annual meeting notice obligation. The Association's Bylaws at
Article III, Section 5, impose on the Secretary a duty to timely mail notice of
the annual meeting to each owner of record. The Association failed to do so.”
7.     “Improper
proxy handling. Pursuant to the Association's Bylaws, proxies must be filed
with the Secretary. Pursuant to Civil Code §5130(b), a proxyholder must cast
the member's vote by secret ballot and proxies may not be used in lieu of
secret ballots. However, proxies were never filed with the Secretary, and at
least one proxyholder submitted proxies-not secret ballots-directly to the
inspector.”
8.     “Unauthorized
electronic member meeting for ballot count. Contrary to multiple authorities,
Annandale counted ballots for the 2023 election at a meeting which could only
be attended via Zoom. (See, e.g., Corp. Code §7510(f) Civil Code §§4926(b),
5120(a); Election and Voting Rules, Paragraph 12(a); Bylaws, Article III,
Section 2.)”
9.     “Ballots
accepted after close of the polls. Pursuant to Election and Voting Rules,
Paragraph 2(d)(i), when the polls closed, the inspector was precluded from
accepting further ballots. However, an additional 50 ballots were accepted and
counted.” 
10.  “Failure
to properly notice election results. Pursuant to Civil Code §5120(b) and
Election and Voting Rules, Paragraph 13(c), Annandale was required to provide
notice of the election results, but failed to provide any such notice to
Plaintiff.”
 
 IV.        
COURT’S FINDINGS
"It is up to the trial court to
weigh the evidence, resolve conflicts in it, and assess
the credibility of witnesses." (Cornerstone Realty Advisors,
LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 789; see
also Tucker v. Pacific Bell Mobile Services (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1548,
1562 ["It is the exclusive function of the trial court to weight the
evidence, resolve conflicts and determine the credibility of
witnesses."] [citation and internal quotation marks omitted]; see also Haworth
v. Superior Court (2010) 50 Cal.4th 372, 385 ["Deference is given to
the factual findings of trial courts because those courts generally are in a
better position to evaluate and weigh the evidence"]; Haraguchi
v. Superior Court (2008) 43 Cal.4th 706, 711 and n. 3 [trial court's
findings of fact are reviewed for substantial evidence and the fact that
"findings were based upon declarations and other written evidence
does not lessen the deference due those findings"].) 
 
The Court conducted an evidentiary
hearing as described above. The court has
reviewed all of the evidence.  The court has weighed the evidence, resolved
conflicts in it, and has assessed the credibility of the witness. Specifically,
the court utilizes the factors set forth in Cal Evid Code § 780, specifically: the
witness’s demeanor while testifying and the manner in which they testified, the
character of the witness’s testimony, the extent of her capacity to perceive,
to recollect, or to communicate any matter about which they testified, the
extent of the witness’s opportunity to perceive any matter about which they testified,
the existence or nonexistence of any fact testified to by the witness, and the
other factors listed in the section. 
 
The court finds that all
witnesses were credible and believable, with one narrow exception not affecting
the court’s conclusion. (Specifically, the plaintiff was asked on direct
examination, and again on cross-examination, about his motives in nominating
343 people to the board. Responding to suggestions that this might be viewed as
a game of “gotcha” or a “trip-wire”, Plaintiff testified repeatedly that he
nominated these 343 people, almost entirely without a single person’s consent, so
as to “empower” these fellow members of the association and he never thought
that this would have the effect of overwhelming the election administrators. This
strains credulity but is ultimately not relevant to the court’s determination.)

Summary Of Relevant
Facts Which the Court Finds To Be Supported By The Evidence
 
The Association’s operative
Election and Voting Rules (the “Election Rules”), as required by Civil Code
§5105(a), were adopted by the Association in January, 2020, and amended by
resolution on January 17, 2023. The Election Rules, at Paragraph 1(b) provide
that, “At least thirty (30) days before the ballots are distributed, the
Association will provide general notice of (1) the date and time by which, and
address where, ballots are to be returned; (2) the date, time and location of
the meeting to tabulate the ballots; and (3) the list of all candidates' names
that will appear on the ballot.” The Election Rules, at Paragraph 2(d)(i)
provides that, “…only those ballots which are delivered to the inspectors of
election prior to the polls closing shall be counted.” (Exh. 17.) Additionally,
The Election Rules, at Paragraph 2(e) provides: “The time for the return of
secret ballots may be extended for reasonable intervals at the discretion of the
Board, with or without notice to the Members.” (Exh. 17)
 
The General Notice of Election
Meeting/Candidate List, Annandale Townhouse Association, Inc., mailed out at
least 30 days prior to the election, stated: “Mailed in secret ballots must be received
by the Inspector no later than noon on October 16, 2023.” (Exh. 10.)
 
The Annandale Voting
Instruction Form (Exh. 49) states: “Any Secret Ballot not received on or before
the deadline cannot be counted, except that the Board of Directors reserves the
right to extend the deadline by which the Secret Ballots must be returned.” The
Annandale Voting Instruction Form contains the statement at the bottom of the form,
underlined and in bold: “Mailed
in secret ballots must be mailed and received by Correct Elect, no later than
noon, on October 16, 2023[.]” (Exh. 49.) 
 
On October 17, 2023, the
Association’s annual member meeting and 2023 election of Directors was convened
in person at its on-site Clubhouse. The polls were opened at approximately 7:00
p.m. and closed at approximately 7:18 p.m. After the polls closed, the
Inspector announced that only 131 secret ballots had been received thus the
required quorum of 51% had not been met but that the second attempt reduced
quorum of 33 1/3% had been exceeded. Based on the failure to achieve quorum
(51%) participation, a majority of the members present at the meeting made and
passed a motion from the floor to temporarily adjourn the meeting for a period
of 48-hours pursuant to the Association’s amended Bylaws, at Article III,
Section 6, and reconvene electronically (Zoom) only at that time. 
 
After October 17, 2023 and
before October 19, 2023, the inspector of elections gathered 50 more ballots
from her post-office box.  
 
On October 19, 2023, a meeting
was conducted via Zoom. The polls were not re-opened as “quorum established at
reduced quorum.” (“2nd Attempt Annual Election Agenda/Notice”, Exh.
11.) The inspector of elections then counted the votes as they appeared on the 131
ballots received prior to the first meeting, and the votes as they appeared on
the 50 ballots from her post-office box collected on October 18th
and 19th. According to the official results (Exh. 13) and the
testimony of Victor Martinez (as to the sixth, seventh, and eighth place
participants), the results of the election were as follows:

V.        
STATEMENT OF DECISION
The evidence established that
there were several instances of non-compliance in the run-up to the election,
the balloting procedure, and the notice of the results. (These are claims 1-8
and 10.) However, this non-compliance can be characterized as “de minimis” and “nitpicky”
(e.g., the failure to notify the 343 people nominated by the plaintiff and the failure
to send election materials to his sister’s address in South Africa.) Therefore,
even assuming the plaintiff has met his burden as set forth in California Civil
Code §5145(a) as to claims 1-8 and 10, the court finds that the Association has
established by a preponderance of the evidence, that any non-compliance as it
relates to these nine claims (#1-8, 10) did not affect the results of the
election. 
 
However, as to claim #9, that “ballots were accepted after close
of the polls […] in violation of the Election and Voting Rules, Paragraph
2(d)(i)”, the court finds that the inspector of elections improperly counted 50 ballots
that were received after the polls closed. Specifically, the inspector of
elections testified that she gathered and counted 50 more ballots from her
post-office box after October 17, 2023 and before October 19, 2023. Of the
mail-in ballots, only those received by noon on October 16, 2023, the day
before the meeting and the day specifically outlined in Exhibits 10, 17, and 49,
should have been counted. In total, only the ballots (both in person and
mail-in) in the possession of the inspector at the meeting by the close of the
polls on October 17, 2023, if deemed valid, should have been counted. There was
no evidence to establish that the Board of Directors authorized the extension
of the deadline. 
 
The court has counted, by hand,
the number of ballots received into evidence as Exhibit 19. Of the 181 total envelopes,
151 are postmarked and 30 are not. The inspector of elections did not separate
or differentiate between the envelopes received by her prior to October 17,
2023 and those that were received after.  After the 181 ballots were counted by the
inspector, all of the envelopes were co-mingled in the “Box of Election
Materials.” (Exh. 19.) Given the testimony of the inspector of elections and
the co-mingled nature of the actual evidence, there is no way to determine
which of the 50 ballots collected after October 17, 2023 (October 18, 2023 and
October 19, 2023) were received after the polls closed. Nor is the court satisfied
that the only mail-in ballots counted were those that were received by noon on
October 16, 2023, the day before the meeting and the day specifically outlined
in Exhibits 10, 17, and 49. 
 
In short, there is no way to
determine which ballots were properly received and counted and which were not. Furthermore,
the candidates were separated by the number of votes depicted in the table
above. While the 5th and 6th place finishers were
separated by more than 50 votes, each of the 50 ballots received
after the October 17, 2023 included the ability to cast 5 votes, including 5
votes for the same person. Accordingly, the court finds that the defendant has
not established that any noncompliance did not affect the results of the
election.  
 
 VI.        
CONCLUSION
Therefore, the court GRANTS the Plaintiff’s motion for a
declaration and order, pursuant to Corporations Code §7616, that the October
2023 election for the Board of Directors of Annandale Townhouse Association,
Inc. is invalid. The court orders the reseating the prior board of directors
and directs the Association to conduct a new election consistent with the timeframes
outlined in the governing documents. As to the Plaintiff’s motion for the
assessment of civil penalties pursuant to Cal Civ Code § 5145(b), the court finds that the Association's noncompliance with the
election operating rules was not intentional
nor reckless, nor did it result from a willful misconduct by the association or
their agent. Given the facts of this case and after much deliberation, the
court does not impose any civil penalties. As to the motion for attorney’s fees under Cal Civ Code § 5145, the Court will decide that issue after
a separate noticed motion and hearing. (See Rancho Mirage Country Club
Homeowners Assn. v. Hazelbaker (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 252, 260; Artus v. Gramercy Towers Condominium Assn., 76 Cal. App. 5th 1043; Almanor Lakeside Villas Owners Assn. v. Carson (2016), 246 Cal. App. 4th 761.)
 
Plaintiffs are directed to prepare, submit and serve a
proposed judgment.
