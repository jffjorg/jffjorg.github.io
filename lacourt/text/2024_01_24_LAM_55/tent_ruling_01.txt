  Case Number:  19STCV23612    Hearing Date:   January 24, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Plaintiffs’ Motion for an Order Staying
Proceedings.
 
Plaintiffs have filed a motion requesting a stay of
this entire action pending the completion of the appeal in Lorenzo v. Calex
Engineering, Inc. et al., Court of Appeal Case No. B331177. Plaintiffs
explain that the remaining claims and defenses at issue in the case are
embraced therein and affected by the judgment appealed from in the Lorenzo
case such that this action must be stayed. The Court agrees that a stay in this
action, which consists of the lead action and several related and consolidated
actions, is appropriate. Plaintiffs and several Defendants filed a stipulation
of non-opposition to the stay, however, Defendants Randle and Los Morales
Trucking, Inc. did not sign the stipulation and so it appears that it does not comprise
a stipulation of all parties. But it does not matter because the Court finds
good cause to grant the motion for a stay. A status conference re: appeal in Lorenzo and status of stay is set for 1/22/2025 at 8:30 a.m. The parties shall
submit a joint status report 5 calendar days before the status conference
informing the Court of the status of the appeal and the parties’ positions on
the stay of this action.
