 Case Number:  23STCV21547    Hearing Date:   January 24, 2024    Dept:  55  
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Motion Of Specially Appearing Defendant
Redpoint County Mutual Insurance Company To Quash Service Of Summons And
Complaint For Lack Of Jurisdiction.
 
The motion is granted.
The Court quashes service of the summons and
Complaint, and dismisses the Complaint without prejudice, only as to Specially
Appearing Defendant REDPOINT COUNTY MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY.  
Background
In its unverified Complaint, Plaintiff ADMIRAL
INSURANCE COMPANY (“Plaintiff”) seeks a declaratory judgment that an insurance
policy it issued to Defendant GO MAPS, INC. (“Defendant Go Maps”) does not
provide coverage for an arbitration that Defendant REDPOINT COUNTY MUTUAL
INSURANCE COMPANY (“Defendant Redpoint”) noticed against Defendant Go Maps, and
that the insurance policy also does not cover other lawsuits between Defendant
Go Maps and Defendant TOPA INSURANCE GROUP.
Specially Appearing Defendant Redpoint filed this
motion to quash service of summons, arguing this Court does not have personal
jurisdiction over it. Plaintiff opposes the motion. 
Legal Standard 
When a defendant files a motion to quash for lack of
personal jurisdiction, “the burden of proof is placed upon the plaintiff to
establish the facts of jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.”  Aquila, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2007) 148
Cal. App. 4th 556, 568. A plaintiff must demonstrate personal
jurisdiction based upon competent evidence, and not on allegations in an
unverified complaint.  Jewish Defense
Org. v. Sup. Ct. (1999) 72 Cal. App. 4th 1045, 1054-1055.  Personal jurisdiction may be general or
specific. Vons Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Foods, Inc. (1996) 14 Cal. 4th
434, 445. 
General jurisdiction exists when the defendant has “substantial,
continuous, and systematic contacts with California.” DVI, Inc. v. Superior
Ct. (2002) 104 Cal. App. 4th 1080, 1099. 
Specific jurisdiction exists when a defendant’s
“minimum contacts” with the state shows that the defendant purposefully
directed its acts to the state, “that the cause of action [is] related to or
arise or result from the acts or contacts in the forum, and that the exercise
of personal jurisdiction by the forum would be reasonable.” Muckle v.
Superior Ct. (2002) 102 Cal. App. 4th 218, 227–28. 
 
 Analysis 
General jurisdiction over a corporation is appropriate
in the home forum of the corporation, i.e., where the corporation is
incorporated or where it has its principal place of business. Daimler AG v.
Bauman (2014) 571 U.S. 117, 137. A defendant’s contacts with California are
also “substantial, continuous, and systematic” for general jurisdiction, DVI,
Inc., 104 Cal. App. 4th at 1099, if such contacts include maintaining an
office and employees in California and marketing or selling products in
California. Shisler v. Sanfer Sports Cars, Inc., (2006) 146 Cal. App.
4th 1254, 1259. Defendant Redpoint’s evidence makes clear that general
jurisdiction does not exist here. Defendant Redpoint is a Texas corporation
with its principal place of business in Austin, Texas. (Halbrook Decl., ¶ 3.) It
has no office or employees in California, owns no property here, has no mailing
address or phone number in California, and does not transact business in California.
(Id., ¶¶ 4-11.) Plaintiff does not contest these facts and indeed, it does not
make an argument for general jurisdiction at all. 
While Plaintiff argues that the Court should exercise
specific jurisdiction over Defendant Redpoint, it fails to cite any evidence to
analyze the merits of this argument. Plaintiff improperly cites only allegations
in the Complaint to support its arguments for jurisdiction. See Sheard
v. Sup. Ct. (1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 207, 210-12 (holding that an unverified
complaint could not serve as substantial evidence for meeting a plaintiff’s
burden to show personal jurisdiction in opposition to a motion to quash).  Plaintiff therefore fails to meet its burden
to establish personal jurisdiction. Jewish Defense Org., 72 Cal. App.
4th at 1054-1055. Moreover, even if the Court were to consider Plaintiff’s
contention that specific jurisdiction exists based on Defendant Redpoint’s contract
and interactions with Defendant Go Maps, a California corporation, such an
argument is not sufficient to establish specific jurisdiction. “A contract with
an out-of-state party does not automatically establish purposeful availment in
the other party’s home forum.” Stone v. Tex. (1999) 76 Cal. App. 4th 1043,
1048. 
As a fallback position, Plaintiff requests that the
Court provide Plaintiff an opportunity to conduct discovery on Defendant
Redpoint’s minimum contacts with California. “In order to prevail on a motion
for a continuance for jurisdictional discovery, the plaintiff should
demonstrate that discovery is likely to lead to the production of evidence of
facts establishing jurisdiction.” In re Automobile Antitrust Cases I &
II (2005) 135 Cal. App. 4th 100, 127. Plaintiff has made no such showing
here. The Court therefore exercises its discretion to deny Plaintiff’s request
for jurisdictional discovery.
