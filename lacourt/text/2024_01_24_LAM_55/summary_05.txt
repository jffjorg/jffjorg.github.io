And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling in the case of BC684669, filed in 2017 by Camilla Lopez Magallanes against the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD). The case involves a motion by LAUSD to conduct independent medical examinations (IMEs) of the Plaintiff and to reopen discovery for medical records and a deposition of the Plaintiff. The Judge agrees with LAUSD that good cause exists for the Plaintiff to submit to further IMEs, as the Plaintiff now claims new or worse injuries than previously reported. The Judge also concludes that LAUSD must confer with its examiners and cull the list of potential tests to a more manageable number. The Judge expects the parties to meet and confer to reach a reasonable compromise on the scope of the potential tests to be administered. The Judge has continued the motion to February 23, 2024, and ordered LAUSD to provide a revised notice of the three examinations listing a more narrowed set of potential tests to be administered by the examiners. The Judge also ordered LAUSD to make clear in the revised notice that all mental examinations may be audio-recorded.
