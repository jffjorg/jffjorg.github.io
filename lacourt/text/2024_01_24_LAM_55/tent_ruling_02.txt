 Case Number:  22STCV19039    Hearing Date:   January 24, 2024    Dept:  55  
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:      Motion
of Defendant
JINA SOHN, M.D. for Terminating Sanctions.
 
Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions is
granted.
Defendant JINA SOHN, M.D. is
ordered dismissed from this action with prejudice. 
 
 
On 6/10/22, Plaintiff PAUL BUTAKOV (“Plaintiff”), a
self-represented litigant, filed a Complaint for medical negligence against
several defendants including JINA SOHN, M.D. (“Defendant”). Defendant now brings
a motion for terminating sanctions, on grounds that: (1) Plaintiff failed to
comply with the Court’s 5/24/2023 order compelling Plaintiff to response to
Defendant’s Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One),
Requests for Admissions (Set One), and Requests for Production of Documents
(Set One) an pay monetary sanctions, and 2) Plaintiff violated the Court’s 8/23/2023
order compelling Plaintiff to respond to the outstanding discovery requests by 10/30/2023.

.
The Court has previously granted co-defendants’
similar motions for terminating sanctions, on 11/30/23, 12/20/23 and 1/12/24.  
Here, again, the Court finds that the motions were ordered
continued from 8/23/23, which gave Plaintiff until 10/30/23 to serve all due
discovery responses upon defendants.  It
appearing that Plaintiff previously admitted recovering and regaining the
ability to serve the discovery responses by 10/30/23, but has not yet served
them, the Court finds Plaintiff’s willful failures to comply with the discovery
orders, and dismisses this action with prejudice as to Defendant.
