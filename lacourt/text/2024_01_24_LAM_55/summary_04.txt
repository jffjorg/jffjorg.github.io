```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to quash service of summons filed by Defendant Redpoint County Mutual Insurance Company, and has dismissed the Complaint without prejudice as to this defendant. The Complaint seeks a declaratory judgment that an insurance policy issued by Plaintiff Admiral Insurance Company does not provide coverage for an arbitration or other lawsuits between Defendant Go Maps, Inc. and Defendant Topa Insurance Group. Defendant Redpoint argued that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over it, and the judge agreed, finding that Plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish jurisdiction. The judge also denied Plaintiff's request for jurisdictional discovery, citing a lack of showing that such discovery would lead to the production of evidence establishing jurisdiction.
