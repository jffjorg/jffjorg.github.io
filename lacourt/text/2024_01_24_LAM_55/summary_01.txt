And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting a stay of proceedings in this case pending the completion of the appeal in Lorenzo v. Calex Engineering, Inc. et al. The judge agrees that a stay is necessary because the remaining claims and defenses at issue in the case are affected by the judgment appealed from in the Lorenzo case. The judge notes that a stipulation of non-opposition to the stay was filed by some parties, but not all, but finds good cause to grant the motion for a stay anyway. A status conference is set for January 22, 2025, to discuss the appeal and the status of the stay. The parties are required to submit a joint status report 5 calendar days before the status conference.
