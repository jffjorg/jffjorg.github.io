Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by the Defendant, Group X Rosemead Properties, LP, to the Plaintiffs' Unverified Complaint for Damages. The demurrer was sustained in part without leave to amend (as to the Sixth Cause of Action for Private Nuisance) and was otherwise overruled. The motion to strike the attorneys' fees allegations in the Complaint was denied. The Judge ruled that the Complaint adequately pleads the causes of action, including breach of implied warranty of habitability, breach of statutory warranty of habitability, breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, negligence, violation of Civil Code Section 1942.4, private nuisance, and violation of Civil Code Section 789.3. The Judge also denied the motion to strike the attorneys' fees allegations, finding that there is no minimum pleading standard for attorneys' fees and that later discovery may reveal a basis for their recovery.
