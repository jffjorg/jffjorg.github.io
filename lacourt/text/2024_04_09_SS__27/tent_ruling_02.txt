 Case Number:  21STCV12624    Hearing Date:   April 9, 2024    Dept:  27 Complaint: 4/2/21 Hon. Lee S. Arian Department 27 Tentative Ruling ¿¿ Hearing Date:  4/9/2024 at 1:30 p.m. Case No./Name.: 21STCV12624 MARGARET BOCK vs CITY OF LA MIRADA Motion Name: Motion to Compel Further Testimony at Deposition Moving Party: Defendant WEST COAST ARBORISTS, INC Responding Party: Defendant CITY OF LA MIRADA Notice: Sufficient ¿¿¿¿ Ruling: MOTION TO COMPEL MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER TESTIMONY AT DEPOSITION IS DENIED.  Background On April 2, 2021, Plaintiff filed the present trip and fall case against Defendant City of La Mirada. La Mirada filed a cross-complaint against Defendant West Coast Arborists (WCA) for indemnity. On December 7, 2023, Defendant WCA took the deposition of Marlin Munoz, an employee of the City of La Mirada, during which counsel for the City of La Mirada instructed Munoz not to answer two lines of questioning because they were duplicative and harassing. Consequently, WCA filed a motion to compel Munoz to provide further testimony. Currently, the last day to hear discovery motions is February 11, 2024, but the motion to compel is set to be heard on April 9, 2024. Legal Standard and Analysis Pursuant to CCP § 2024.020, "except as otherwise provided in this section, any party shall be entitled as a matter of right … to have motions concerning discovery heard on or before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the action. A continuance or postponement of the trial date does not operate to reopen discovery proceedings." The trial date controlling the discovery cut-off is February 26, 2024. Therefore, the discovery cut-off date was January 27, 2024, and the last date to have motions concerning discovery heard was on or before February 11, 2024. The current discovery motion is set to be heard on April 9, 2024. Although the final status conference (FSC) and the trial date were continued from February 9, 2024, to July 15, 2024 and from February 26, 2024, to July 29, 2024, respectively, the court specified in its January 18, 2024 minute order that the discovery deadline remains tied to the February 26, 2024 trial date unless a stipulation or noticed motion is filed. However, no motion to reopen discovery or a stipulation to reopen discovery was filed by Defendant after the Court issued its order on January 18, 2024. When the hearing for a discovery motion is held after the discovery motion hearing cut-off date, the Court cannot grant a motion to compel without first deciding on a motion to reopen discovery. (Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1588.) Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to compel is DENIED. PLEASE TAKE NOTICE:¿¿¿¿¿¿ ¿¿¿ If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept27@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.  Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.  If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.
