The court has granted the Baldwin Defendants' motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Gibbs, who is alleged to have assaulted and robbed the plaintiff on property owned by the Baldwin Defendants. The Baldwin Defendants learned through discovery responses that Gibbs was responsible for the assault and robbery. The court found that the allegations arise out of the same transaction as the plaintiff's complaint, making leave mandatory. The court ordered the Baldwin Defendants to file the proposed cross-complaint within 7 days.
