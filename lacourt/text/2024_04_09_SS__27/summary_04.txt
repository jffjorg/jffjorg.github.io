And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the plaintiff's counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel. The counsel, Daniel Moossai, sought to withdraw from representing the plaintiff citing an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The motion was unopposed, but the court denied it because the plaintiff's counsel failed to provide proof of service on the plaintiff. The court also noted that the next hearing is scheduled for April 15, 2024, and the plaintiff may not have sufficient time to retain new counsel or prepare to represent himself.
