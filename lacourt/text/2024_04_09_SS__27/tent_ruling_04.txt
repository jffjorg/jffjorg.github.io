 Case Number:  22STCV18845    Hearing Date:   April 9, 2024    Dept:  27 ¿¿ Hon. Lee S. Arian Department 27 Tentative Ruling ¿¿¿¿ Hearing Date:  4/9/2024 at 1:30 p.m. Case No./Name.: 22STCV18845 DAVID SEIF, AN INDIVIDUAL vs. JOHN DOE Motion: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL Moving Party: Plaintiff’s Counsel Daniel Moossai Responding Party: Unopposed Notice: Insufficient ¿¿¿¿¿¿ Ruling: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL IS DENIED. ¿¿¿ ¿ Background ¿¿ Attorney Daniel Moossai represents Plaintiff.  Moosai moves to be relieved as counsel, citing an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. No opposition has been filed. ¿¿ Legal Standard ¿¿ The Court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.) ¿¿ A motion to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) ¿¿ Analysis and Conclusion ¿¿ Moosai has filed Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). Moosai seeks to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff on the grounds that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The Court finds this to be proper grounds for withdrawal. (See Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014 (a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is grounds for allowing the attorney to withdraw).)  However, the Court cannot grant the motion because no proof of service of the motion on Plaintiff has been filed. Moreover, the next hearing for an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Failure to File Proof of Service and Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Failure to File Default Judgment as to SDLA Courier Service, Inc. is scheduled for April 15, 2024. This timeframe is insufficient for Plaintiff to retain new counsel or be prepared to represent himself.  Accordingly, the motion is denied. ¿¿¿ ¿PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: ¿¿¿¿¿ If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept27@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ ¿¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue. ¿¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.
