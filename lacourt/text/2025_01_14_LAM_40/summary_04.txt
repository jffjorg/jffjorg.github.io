And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling granting both of the plaintiff's motions. The first motion is to compel the defendant, the Estate of Wayne Nelson, to respond to the form interrogatories and requests for admission. The second motion is to deem the requests for admission served on the defendant as admitted. The judge finds that the defendant failed to timely respond to the interrogatories and requests for admission, and that the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions is warranted. The judge orders the defendant to serve verified responses to the form interrogatories within 10 days, and deems the requests for admission served on the defendant as admitted. The judge also imposes total sanctions against the defendant and its counsel, Law Offices of Loyst Fletcher, in the amount of $2,925.00, which includes 6 hours of preparation time and 1 hour of appearance time at a rate of $400 per hour, as well as costs of $125. The sanctions are payable to the plaintiff's counsel within 10 days.
