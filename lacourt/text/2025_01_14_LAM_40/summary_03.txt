And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling regarding a motion filed by Defendant Roger Anderson, Trustee of the RWA Trust, to compel a nonparty witness, Union Home Loan, Inc., to produce documents in response to a deposition subpoena. The motion is defective because it was not personally served on the nonparty witness as required by statute. The judge notes that the court has the authority to compel a witness' compliance with a subpoena, but the nonparty deponent must be personally served with the motion unless they agree to accept service by mail or electronic service. Since the motion was not properly served, the judge takes the motion off the calendar.
