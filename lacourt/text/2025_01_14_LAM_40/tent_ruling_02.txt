 Case Number:  23STCV27219    Hearing Date:   January 14, 2025    Dept:  40  23STCV27219 Jose Mendoza, et al. v. Dre Law, APC et al. Tuesday,   January 14, 2025   [TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING THE  HEARING ON DEFENDANTS’ DEMURRER TO THE COMPLAINT         This  action, filed on November 6, 2023, arises from Defendants’ alleged negligence  in representing Plaintiffs in an underlying Petition for Writ of Mandamus  against the City of Maywood. Plaintiffs allege one cause of action for legal  malpractice.        Defendants  contend the claim is barred by the one-year statute of limitations and demurs  on that ground. Plaintiffs contend the demurrer is untimely filed more than the  30 days after Defendants’ response was due. While Defendants contend they  served Plaintiffs by email, the proof of service does not indicate what email  address Defendants used for Plaintiffs.        In  reply, Defendants do not dispute that the demurrer is untimely, but the delay  does not affect Plaintiffs’ substantial rights.        The  court’s file reflects that on November 12, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of  Related Cases contending that this matter is related to 19STCP05291, filed on  December 10, 2019, and pending in Department 86 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.  The notice lists a second purportedly related matter filed on October 23, 2020,  and pending in the Norwalk Courthouse.       On  November 20, 2024, the court ordered Plaintiffs to file the Notice of Related  Cases in Departments 86 and Dept F in Norwalk in compliance with California  Rules of Court, Rule 3.300, subd.(h)(1)(A).). (M.O.  11/20/2.) The court’s file reflects that Plaintiffs have not  complied with the court’s order.ruary     Plaintiffs  are ordered to comply with the November 20, 2024, minute order, as the court  with the earliest filed case must determine whether the cases are related. The  court continues the hearing on Defendants’ demurrer to Feb 4,   2025, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 40 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
