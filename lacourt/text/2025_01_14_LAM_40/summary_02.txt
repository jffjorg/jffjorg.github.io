And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling continues the hearing on the Defendants' demurrer to the Complaint, which was filed on November 6, 2023. The case arises from the Defendants' alleged negligence in representing the Plaintiffs in a Petition for Writ of Mandamus against the City of Maywood. The Plaintiffs allege one cause of action for legal malpractice, while the Defendants contend that the claim is barred by the one-year statute of limitations and filed a demurrer on that ground. The Plaintiffs contend that the demurrer is untimely filed, as it was not filed within the 30-day period after the Defendants' response was due. The Judge notes that the proof of service does not indicate what email address the Defendants used for the Plaintiffs. The Judge has ordered the Plaintiffs to comply with the California Rules of Court, Rule 3.300, subd.(h)(1)(A), which requires them to file a Notice of Related Cases in the relevant departments. The Plaintiffs have not complied with this order. The Judge sets the hearing for February 4, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 40 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.
