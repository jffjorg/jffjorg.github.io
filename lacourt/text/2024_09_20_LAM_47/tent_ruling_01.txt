STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for defamation that was filed on May 15, 2023.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant made numerous false statements about him on
social media. 
 
Defendant moves for attorney’s fees
as the prevailing party on a Special Motion to Strike. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant’s Motion for Attorney’s
Fees is GRANTED in the amount of $65,024.10.
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Defendant moves for attorney’s fees
as the prevailing party on a Special Motion to Strike. 
 
//
 
Defendant’s Evidentiary Objection
 
            Defendant
objects to a citation in Plaintiff’s opposition to this motion which references
a 2014 federal district court opinion as an improper citation. A citation to
legal authority, valid or not, is argument, not evidence. Defendant’s objection
is improper and therefore OVERRULED. 
 
Plaintiff’s Overlength Opposition
 
Defendant objects to Plaintiff’s
opposition as overlength. Plaintiff’s memorandum of points and authorities in
support of their opposition is 19 substantive pages in length, discounting the front
matter, the tables of contents and authorities, and the proof of service.
Pursuant to California Rule of Court 3.1113(d), an opening or responding
memorandum on any motion other than a motion for summary judgment or
adjudication may not exceed 15 substantive pages. (Cal Rule of Court
3.1113(d).) A party may seek leave to file an overlength memorandum. (Rule of
Court 3.1113(e).) However, an overlength memorandum which is filed without
leave must be considered in the same manner as a late-filed paper. (Rule of
Court 3.1113(g).) The Court has discretion to refuse to consider late-filed
papers. (Rule of Court 3.1300(d).) Plaintiff did not seek leave to file an
overlength brief. The Court therefore refuses to consider the overlength pages
of Plaintiff’s opposition, encompassing Plaintiff’s challenge to the positive
multiplier request and the issue of costs. 
 
Entitlement to Fees
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
425.16(c) entitles a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike,
otherwise known as an anti-SLAPP motion, to recover its attorney’s fees and
costs. The amount of attorneys’ fees awarded must be reasonable. (See, e.g., Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131.) However, the prevailing defendant
may only recover fees and costs incurred in connection with the motion to strike.
(Lafayette Morehouse, inc. v. Chronical Publishing Co. (1995) 39
Cal.App.4th 1379, 1383.) This limitation nevertheless permits recovery of consequential
fees, such as those incurred litigating the fee award (Ketchum v. Moses,
supra, 24 Cal.4th at 1141) and on appeal. (Evans v. Unkow (1995) 38
Cal.App.4th 1490, 1499-1500 [Section 425.16(c) permits recovery of appellate
fees because they are not expressly precluded by the statutory language].) Examples
of matters which are excluded from a fee award under this provision include, inter
alia, fees for “attacking service of process, preparing and revising an
answer to the complaint” and “obtaining the docket at the inception of the
case.” (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th
1315, 1325.) 
 
Reasonableness of Fees
 
            Defendant
seeks an award of attorney’s fees in the amount of $127,730.62, as corrected in
the reply papers, accounting for $67,574 in fees to obtain the judgment;
$10,285 in post-judgment fees before the motion was filed, $16,065 in fees to
prepare the reply papers, and $33,789 reflecting a 1.5x multiplier on the
pre-judgment fees. 
Reasonable
attorney fees are ordinarily determined by the Court pursuant to the “lodestar”
method, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate. (See PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22
Cal.4th 1084, 1095-1096; Margolin v. Regional Planning Com. (1982) 134
Cal.App.3d 999, 1004 [“California courts have consistently held that a
computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is
fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys' fee award.”].) “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for
comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court
based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty
of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”  (Ibid.)
In setting the hourly rate for a fee award, courts are entitled to consider the
“fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community for
similar work.” (Bihun v. AT&T Info. Sys., Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th
976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin
v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 664.)  The burden
is on the party seeking attorney’s fees to prove the reasonableness of the
fees. (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino
(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 615.) 
 
The Court has broad discretion in determining the
amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award, which will not be overturned
absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or
necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi
v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.)  The
Court need not explain its calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded
in detail; identifying the factors considered in arriving at the amount will
suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Indus. Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258,
274-275.) 
1.     
Base
Fee Request
Defendant requests a base fee award
of $93,924, as reduced on reply. This request is derived from 79.5 hours of
attorney time at an hourly rate of $850 per hour before judgment (Declaration
of Paul Boylan ISO Mot. Exh. 1; see also Supplemental Declaration of Paul
Boylan ISO Reply ¶ 7), 12.1 hours at the same rate incurred post-judgment
before the motion was filed (Boylan Decl. Exh. 2) and 19.9 hours to draft the
reply papers. (Boylan Supp. Decl. Exh. 1.) The Court observes that Defendant
originally requested compensation for 94 hours of attorney time to obtain the
judgment, which included time for work performed in July 2023 when Attorney
Boylan was suspended from the practice of law. (See Boylan Supp. Decl. ¶ 7.)
Defendant’s counsel admits that the inclusion of this time, totaling 14.5
hours, was an error, and the revised calculation of 79.5 hours in the reply
papers eliminates that time. 
Attorney Boylan testifies to his extensive
legal experience both in general and with respect to defamation claims and
special motions to strike. (Boylan Decl. ¶¶ 2-12.) Counsel for Defendant states
that he agreed to represent Defendant on a contingency basis but calculates his
fees based on his customary non-contingency rate of $850 per hour, based on his
background and experience in these matters. (Id.¶¶
14-15, 17.) Attorney Boylan has also provided itemized billing records
describing the work performed, the date of work, and the number of hours
incurred. (See Boylan Decl. Exhs. 1-2, Boylan Supp. Decl. Exh. 1.) 
Plaintiff, in opposition, offers several challenges to the fee
request. First, Plaintiff contends that Defendant is improperly seeking fees for
matters unrelated to the Special Motion to Strike. Although Plaintiff’s
opposition does not identify any specific time entries which are objectionable,
the Court observes from the billing records that 13.5 hours of attorney time
billed between June 2023 and March 2024 pertain, on their face, to issues of
service of process and the Motion to Set Aside Default. (See Boylan Decl. Exh.
1.) Although Defendant, in response, contends that the fee recovery provision
of section 425.16 should be broadly construed, an attack on service of process
is categorically excluded from recovery under section 425.16, as those fees
would have been incurred even if the special motion to strike had not been
made. (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165
Cal.App.4th 1315, 1325.) That the Motion to Set Aside offered the Special
Motion to Strike as its proposed pleading is of no consequence, because the
Motion to Strike was not a necessary component; Defendant could have elected
simply to offer a proposed answer instead of that motion. Defendant’s
base fee request must therefore be reduced by 13.5 hours, or $11,475, to excise
prejudgment fees not related to the Special Motion to Strike. 
Plaintiff also contends that Defendant’s counsel should not
recover fees incurred before July 2023 because he made representations to
Plaintiff’s counsel before that date that he was not representing Defendant at
that time, and because he did not download the Complaint in this case until
July 6, 2023, according to the billing records. Plaintiff offers no authority
for this proposition, and, moreover, it is not for Plaintiff to state when the
attorney-client relationship was established between Defendant and her counsel.

            Plaintiff
further contends that Defendant’s counsel admitted in correspondence that he
was inflating his fees. This contention is based on representations made by
Attorney Boylan on or about April 11, 2024, that his estimated fees at that
time, not counting any duplicative billing, was approximately $65,000.
(Declaration of Frances Cambell ISO Opp. ¶ 15.) That estimate is roughly
commensurate with the prejudgment fees requested by Defendant, and therefore is
not evidence of inflated fees. The Court observes that Defendant’s counsel
claims an excessive 19.9 hours in reviewing Plaintiff’s opposition and
preparing the reply papers for this motion, with 15.2 hours incurred on the
reply brief alone, plus 1.1 hours incurred to prepare a spurious objection. (Boylan
Supp. Decl. Exh. 1.) This is not reasonable billing, especially for an attorney
with decades of experience and who claims an hourly rate of $850 per hour. The
Court will therefore reduce the fee request for the opposition to 5 hours at
$850 per hour, for a total of $4,250 and a reduction of $12,665.
 
Finally, Plaintiff argues that
Defendant’s hourly rate is excessive and not adequately justified. The Court
finds this argument to be of little force where the Court has already imposed
substantial reductions on the number of hours claimed for improper or excessive
billing. 
 
//
2.     
Multiplier
 
Defendant seeks a positive 1.5x
multiplier on the pre-judgment fees based on the contingent nature of Attorney
Boylan’s representation. Fee multipliers, or enhancements, are available for
representation on a contingent basis for a party who prevails on a special
motion to strike. (Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at 1136-1140.) Such enhancements
are entirely discretionary and may be awarded to compensate for contingent risk
or to reflect exceptional skill in the litigation. (Id. at 1138-39.) Although
Defendant’s counsel describes this case as “unusually difficult and time
consuming” and Plaintiff’s litigation strategy as “scorched earth,” there is
little in the Court’s record or Attorney Boylan’s billing to support those
conclusions. (Boylan Decl. ¶¶ 16, 18.) Moreover, the Court considers the
contingent risk and skill displayed in the litigation to be amply accounted for
in the high hourly rate of Defendant’s counsel. The Court therefore declines to
apply a positive multiplier.
 
In opposition, Plaintiff contends that the Court should impose a
negative multiplier for the lack of civility displayed by Defendant’s counsel.
Negative multipliers may be imposed for lack of civility, as “[c]ivility is an
aspect of skill. (Karton v. Ari
Design & Construction, Inc. (2021)
61 Cal.App.5th 734, 746-47.) Although incivility may result in an increase in the
costs of litigation, there need not be a direct causal connection between a
lack of civility and an excess of fees awarded. (Snoeck v. Exaktime Innovations, Inc. (2023) 96 Cal.App.5th 908, 927 [“‘Excellent lawyers deserve higher
fees, and excellent lawyers are civil.’ [citation] Awarding the same amount of
attorney fees to an uncivil lawyer as one who is civil thus would not
constitute a reasonable fee”].) Plaintiff contends that Attorney Boylan made
numerous uncivil remarks in correspondence with Plaintiff’s counsel, including,
inter alia, threatening sanctions pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 128.7 (Campbell Decl. ¶ 13), describing Plaintiff
himself as “behav[ing] like a bully and an a*hole” and “pretend[ing] to be
simple, or stupid,” and asserting that Defendant’s counsel “[has] the ability
and the incentive to rip [Plaintiff] a new orifice” because “[h]e is not a good
person.” (Campbell Decl. ¶ 15; see also ¶ 18.) In reply, Defendant contends
that the excerpts offered by Plaintiff do not rise to the severity shown in cases
such as Karton and Snoeck. 
 
The Court concurs with Plaintiff that Attorney Boylan’s correspondence
does not demonstrate the professionalism or civility that should be expected
from an attorney of Attorney Boylan’s considerable experience and high hourly
rate, and therefore that a negative multiplier is warranted to reflect the gap
between the skill displayed and the rate requested. That said, the Court also
shares Defendant’s view that the remarks described here are not particularly
severe as compared to Karton and Snoeck, where the lack of
civility was the defining feature of the litigation.  As a reflection of the egregious behavior in
those cases, the judges in Karton and Snoeck imposed substantial
reductions for the incivility displayed, reducing the fees by 70% and 40%,
respectively. (Karton, supra, 61 Cal.App.5th at 748; Snoeck, supra, 96 Cal.App.5th at 911.) In the instant case, the Court finds that a 10%
reduction on the remaining pre-judgment fees is an appropriate correction. 
 
The Court therefore declines to apply a positive multiplier and will
instead apply a 10% reduction to the remaining base fees, for a total reduction
of $5,609.90.
 
The Court will therefore award $65,024.10
in attorney’s fees, reflecting $56,099 in prejudgment fees, plus $10,285.00 in
post-judgment fees before the motion was filed and $4,250.00 in fees to prepare
the reply, minus $5,609.90 as a 10% reduction on prejudgment fees. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED in the amount of $65,024.10.
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
