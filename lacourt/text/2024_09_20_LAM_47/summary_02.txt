  - "The Court finds this contention unpersuasive because, Plaintiffs’ assertion to the contrary notwithstanding, Plaintiffs’ interpretation would, in fact, permit them to charge any amount, without limitation, and extract that sum from Defendant, thereby rendering the language requiring a 'reasonable estimate' ineffective."
  - "The Court concurs with Defendant that Section 6(c)(iv) of the Master Leases requires Plaintiff to first demonstrate that it prepared reasonable estimates of the Direct Expenses as a condition precedent to Defendant’s obligation to pay."
```

Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiffs' motion for summary adjudication of their breach of contract claims. The motion was denied because Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that they prepared reasonable estimates of Direct Expenses, which is a condition precedent to Defendant's obligation to pay. The Judge found that Plaintiffs' interpretation of the lease agreement would permit them to charge any amount without limitation, and therefore the language requiring a "reasonable estimate" is ineffective. The Court will consider any submissions on the tentative ruling by email no later than 4:00 p.m. the day before the hearing.
