Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Theresa M. Traber has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Larry Gross v. Joy Freiberg, granting Defendant Joy Freiberg's Motion for Attorney's Fees in the amount of $65,024.10. The ruling awards the fees as the prevailing party on a Special Motion to Strike, which was granted earlier in the case.

The Court finds that Defendant's counsel, Paul Boylan, has provided reasonable and detailed billing records, but reduces the requested fees by $11,475 to exclude fees incurred for matters unrelated to the Special Motion to Strike. The Court also reduces the fee request for the opposition by $12,665, citing excessive billing.

The Court declines to apply a positive multiplier to the fees, citing the lack of civility displayed by Defendant's counsel in correspondence with Plaintiff's counsel. Instead, the Court applies a 10% reduction on the remaining pre-judgment fees, for a total reduction of $5,609.90.

The ruling notes that Defendant's counsel has a high hourly rate of $850 per hour, but reduces the fees to reflect the lack of civility displayed. The Court finds that the fees are reasonable and awards the requested amount of $65,024.10.
