The court notes Petitioner did not explain the effect of the amendment of the
purchase contract.  Moreover, the court
also notes that there appears to be a page, or language, missing from section
10 of the purchase contract.  (Amended
Ex. A, p. 9, § 10.)  Specifically, the
last sentence in that section appears to be cut off.  (Ibid.)
