MOVING PARTY:                 Petitioner J.G. Wentworth
Originations, LLC            
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Petition for Approval for Transfer of Payment Rights
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this petition.  No opposition papers were filed.
BACKGROUND
Rudy Soto (“Soto”) settled a claim
for damages arising in connection with a house fire in 2021.  (Petition for Approval for Transfer of
Payment Rights filed May 22, 2024 (“Pet.”), ¶ 3.)  Soto has agreed to sell, and petitioner J.G.
Wentworth Originations, LLC (“Petitioner”) has agreed to purchase, six payments
of $4,985.28, to be made on August 27, 2024, February 27, 2025, August 27,
2025, February 27, 2026, August 27, 2026, and February 27, 2027.  (Pet., Ex. A, California Purchase Contract, ¶
2.)  Soto will receive $19,508.67 in
exchange for the transfer of the payment rights set forth above.  (Pet., Ex. A, California Purchase Contract, ¶
10.)  
Petitioner now seeks court
approval of the agreement pursuant to Insurance Code section 10134, et seq.

LEGAL STANDARD
“A direct or indirect transfer
of structured settlement payment rights is not effective and a structured
settlement obligor or annuity issuer is not required to make any payment
directly or indirectly to any transferee of structured settlement payment rights”
unless the court approves the transfer in advance.¿ (Ins. Code, § 10139.5,
subd. (a).)¿ To approve the settlement, the court must make express written
findings that:

The transfer is in the best interest of the payee, taking into
     account the welfare and support of the payee’s dependents.¿¿¿¿¿ 


The payee has been advised in writing by the transferee to seek
     independent professional advice regarding the transfer and has either
     received that advice or knowingly waived, in writing, the opportunity to
     receive the advice.¿¿¿¿¿ 


The transferee has complied with the notification requirements
     pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (f), the transferee has provided
     the payee with a disclosure form that complies with Section 10136, and the
     transfer agreement complies with Sections 10136 and 10138.¿¿¿¿¿ 


The transfer does not contravene any applicable statute or the order
     of any court or other government authority.¿¿¿¿¿ 


The payee understands the terms of the transfer agreement, including
     the terms set forth in the disclosure statement required by Section
     10136.¿¿¿¿¿ 


The payee understands and does not wish to exercise the payee’s
     right to cancel the transfer agreement.¿¿¿¿¿ 

(Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd.
(a)(1)-(6).)¿¿¿¿¿ 
“When determining whether the
proposed transfer should be approved, including whether the transfer is fair,
reasonable, and in the payee’s best interest, taking into account the welfare
and support of the payee’s dependents, the court shall consider the totality of
the circumstances,” including the 15 circumstances set forth in Insurance Code
§ 10139.5, subdivision (b)(1)-(15).
DISCUSSION
Based on the Petition and the documents submitted in support of it,
the court finds and orders as follows.
The court finds that Petitioner has not complied with the
notification requirements set forth in Section 10139.5, subdivision (f)(2).  (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(3).) 
Insurance
Code section 10139.5, subdivision (f)(2) requires Petitioner to file and serve,
not less than 20 days before the hearing on a petition for approval of a
transfer of payment rights, a notice of the proposed transfer and the petition
for its authorization, a copy of the proposed transfer agreement, a listing of
each of the payee’s dependents, disclosures as required by section 10136, and,
if available, copies of the annuity contract, any qualified assignment
agreement, and the underlying structured settlement agreement.¿ 
On June 7,
2024, Petitioner filed a “Proof of Service of Verified Petition et al.,” establishing
that Petitioner served Soto, the settling attorney, the annuity issuer, and the
annuity obligor with notice of the hearing on the Petition, the Petition, and
the notice of case assignment on June 6, 2024, by mail and overnight mail.  (June 7, 2024 Proof of Service.)  The Petition includes a copy of the original proposed
transfer agreement (Pet., Ex. A.), the California Disclosure Statement (Pet.,
Ex. B), and a copy of the annuity certificate (Pet., Ex. C.).  
However, on
June 28, 2024, Petitioner filed two additional documents in support of its
Petition: (1) the “Declaration of Payee in Support of Petitioner’s Petition for
Approval for Transfer of Payment Rights[Pursuant to Cal. Ins. Code § 10134 et
seq.],” and (2) the “Amended Exhibit ‘A’ to the Petition for Approval for
Transfer of Payment Rights[,]” which attaches an amended California Purchase
Contract between Petitioner and Soto.[1]  These
documents were served on Soto, the settling attorney, the annuity issuer, and the
annuity obligor on June 28, 2024, by mail and overnight mail.  (Soto Decl., pp. 4-5 [proof of service]; June
28, 2024 Amended Ex. A, pp. 16-17 [proof of service].)  As set forth above, a petition and proposed
transfer agreement must be served on all interested parties “[n]ot less than 20
days prior to the scheduled hearing on any petition for approval of a transfer
of structured settlement payment rights under” section 10139.5.  (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subds. (f)(2)(A),
(f)(2)(B).)  Petitioner did not serve
Soto’s supporting declaration or the amended (and therefore operative)
California Purchase Agreement on all interested parties, including the attorney
that represented Soto at the time the structured settlement was created, not
less than 20 days before the July 2, 2024 hearing on the Petition.
            Thus, the court (1) finds that
Petitioner has not complied with the notification requirements, and therefore
(2) denies Petitioner’s Petition, without prejudice to Petitioner’s filing and
serving, on all interested parties and with statutory notice, an amended
Petition and supporting documents.  (Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subds. (a),(4) (f)(2).) 
ORDER
            The court denies petitioner J.G.
Wentworth Originations, LLC’s Petition for Approval for Transfer of Payment
Rights, without prejudice.
            The court orders J.G. Wentworth
Originations, LLC to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
