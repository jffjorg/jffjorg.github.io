And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a petition for approval of a transfer of payment rights. The petition was filed by J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC (Petitioner) to transfer payment rights to Rudy Soto, who had previously settled a claim for damages arising from a house fire in 2021. The transfer is subject to approval under California Insurance Code section 10134 et seq.

The judge finds that Petitioner did not comply with the notification requirements set forth in section 10139.5, subdivision (f)(2). Specifically, Petitioner did not serve Soto's supporting declaration and the amended California Purchase Agreement on all interested parties, including the attorney that represented Soto at the time the structured settlement was created, not less than 20 days before the hearing.

As a result, the judge denies Petitioner's petition, without prejudice to Petitioner's filing and serving an amended petition and supporting documents on all interested parties and with statutory notice.
