DISCUSSION
Kevin A. Lipeles and Thomas H. Schelly of Lipeles Law Group, APC
(“Plaintiffs’ Counsel”) move to be relieved as counsel for plaintiffs Jessica
Figueroa and Jesus Cruz (“Plaintiffs”).
“The
question of granting or denying an application of an attorney to withdraw as
counsel (Code Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. 2) is one which lies within the sound discretion
of the trial court ‘having in mind whether such withdrawal might work an
injustice in the handling of the case.’”¿ (People v. Prince (1968) 268
Cal.App.2d 398, 406 [internal quotations omitted].)¿ The court should also
consider whether the attorney’s “withdrawal can be accomplished without undue
prejudice to the client’s interests.”¿ (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
For
a motion to be relieved as counsel under Code of Civil Procedure section 284,
subdivision (2), California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice
of motion and motion directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration
stating in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section
284, subdivision (2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil
Procedure section 284, subdivision (1) (made on the Declaration in Support of
Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-052)); (3)
service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order on
the client and on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the
proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel -- Civil form (MC-053)).¿¿ 
The court finds that Plaintiffs’ Counsel has served Plaintiffs with
the moving papers by mail, return receipt requested, at Plaintiffs’ last known
addresses, and that Plaintiffs’ Counsel has been unable to locate more current
addresses after making reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before filing
this motion.  (Amended MC-052, ¶ 3,
subds. (a)(2), (b)(1)(a), (b)(2)(a), (b)(2)(b), (b)(2)(e); Amended MC-052, Ex.
1 [return to sender]; Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1362, subd. (d)(1)(B).)  The court also finds that Plaintiffs’ Counsel
has shown sufficient reasons why the motion should be granted, and why counsel
has brought the motion
under Code of Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision (2) instead of filing a
consent under section 284, subdivision (1). 
(Amended MC-052, ¶ 2.) 
The court therefore grants Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s motion to be relieved
as counsel for Plaintiffs. 
Kevin A. Lipeles and Thomas H. Schelly of Lipeles Law Group, APC will
be relieved as counsel of record for plaintiffs Jessica Figuero and Jesus Cruz
effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed “Order Granting
Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil” on the clients. 
The
court orders Kevin A. Lipeles and Thomas H. Schelly of Lipeles
Law Group, APC to give notice of this ruling and the signed “Order Granting
Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil” to plaintiffs Jessica
Figueroa and Jesus Cruz.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  July 2, 2024
