This tentative ruling relates to a hearing on June 26, 2024, in the 39th Department of the Superior Court of California. The case number is 23STCV14949. Plaintiff Beatriz Villela is seeking to compel further responses from Defendant General Motors LLC regarding requests for production of documents (RPD) and to compel the Defendant to produce its person most qualified to testify on specified topics. The Defendant has objected to the RPD, claiming that the information sought is irrelevant, constitutes trade secrets, and includes personally identifiable information. The Court has ruled in favor of the Plaintiff, finding that the information sought is relevant and necessary to the case, and that the Defendant has failed to substantiate its objections. The Court has ordered the Defendant to respond with responsive documents regarding other vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the Plaintiff's vehicle, and to produce its person most qualified for deposition within 30 days of notice of this order.
