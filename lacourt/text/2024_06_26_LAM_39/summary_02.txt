And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel further responses in a case involving plaintiff Vernon Goodwin and defendant The Regents of the University of California. The plaintiff has moved to compel further responses to certain discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The defendant has opposed the motions, arguing that the requests are irrelevant, burdensome, and violate the privacy rights of third parties.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the form interrogatories, which seek information about potential witnesses to the defendant's employment practices. The judge has also granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to certain requests for production of documents, subject to providing the employees notice and an opportunity to opt out of the disclosure of their identities and contact information.

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the special interrogatories, as the defendant has already supplemented its responses to those requests. The judge has also denied the motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents that seek information about classification or compensation reviews conducted by the defendant, absent notice and an opportunity for employees to opt out.

The judge has directed the parties to meet and confer regarding the notice procedure for providing employees with notice and an opportunity to opt out of the disclosure of their identities and contact information. The judge has also ordered the parties to provide notice of this order and file proof of service of same.
