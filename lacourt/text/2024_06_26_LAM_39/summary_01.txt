And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion to quash a subpoena served on Deponent, Wendover Investments Dan Patterson, seeking financial information about GB Entertainment LLC and Plaintiff Gilbert Bell. The subpoena was opposed by Defendant Kyle Johnson. The Court finds that the motion was denied without prejudice due to Plaintiff's failure to personally serve the motion on Deponent, provide notice, and include a separate statement setting forth the particular demands and factual and legal reasons why the court should not compel production of the records. The Court notes that Plaintiff has a right to privacy in his finances, but financial records are directly relevant to this litigation since Defendant alleges Plaintiff abused his position as Nichols's manager and misappropriated funds. The Court concludes that Plaintiff's financial records are not frivolously sought and allows Defendant to conduct discovery.
