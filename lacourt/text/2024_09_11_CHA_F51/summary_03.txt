And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case. The Plaintiff, Rosa Hernandez, has brought a premises liability action against the Defendant, Santa Clarita Valley Water Agency, alleging that she tripped and fell on a Los Angeles Water and Power cover on Soledad Canyon Road in Santa Clarita, California on September 2, 2022. The Defendant has demurred and moved to strike the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer and granted the Plaintiff 20 days leave to amend the First Amended Complaint to correct the location of the subject incident. The Judge has also overruled the Defendant's motion to strike, finding that it is moot in light of the demurrer.

The Judge has also addressed the issue of the Plaintiff's amendment to name the Defendant as Doe defendant 1, finding that it is timely and proper. The Judge has also considered the Defendant's argument that the Plaintiff is attempting to use the fictitious name procedure to bring in the Defendant, but has found that the Plaintiff has properly named the Defendant and has not used the procedure improperly.

The Judge has also cautioned the Plaintiff that following an order sustaining a demurrer with leave to amend, the Plaintiff may amend the complaint only as authorized by the court's order, and may not amend the complaint to add a new cause of action without having obtained permission to do so.
