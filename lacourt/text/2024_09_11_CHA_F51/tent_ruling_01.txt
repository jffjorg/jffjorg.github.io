BACKGROUND
 
This is a personal injury action in which Plaintiff alleges
that on 7/15/21, she was injured as a result of an automobile collision between
the vehicle she was driving and the one driven by Defendant. (Compl. ¶¶ 10–13.)
On 3/10/22, Plaintiff filed her complaint, alleging against Defendant a sole
cause of action for Negligence. On 6/6/22, Defendant filed her answer.
 
On 1/22/24, Plaintiff served Defendant with her Form
Interrogatories, Set Four, and Requests for Admission, Set Three. (Ex. 1 to Decl.
of Misak Chanchikyan.) On 3/18/24, Defendant served her responses thereto. (Ex.
2 to Chanchikyan Decl.) On 3/25/24, Defendant served further responses to the
subject discovery requests. (Ex. 3 to Chanchikyan Decl.)
 
On 6/7/24, Plaintiff filed the instant motions to compel
Defendant’s further responses to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set Four,
Nos. 16.2–16.8, and RFAs, Set Three, Nos. 53, 57–59, 61–70, 72, and
74–85. On 8/14/24 and
8/22/24, Defendant filed her oppositions thereto. On 8/28/24, Plaintiff filed
her replies.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.   
Meet and Confer 
 
A motion to compel further
discovery responses must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration stating “facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2033.290, subd. (b)(1); 2030.300, subd. (b)(1); 2016.040.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff’s counsel declares
that on 4/19/24, he sent Defendant’s counsel a meet-and-confer letter raising
the issues discussed herein. (Ex. 4 to Chanchikyan Decl.) Counsel for
the parties discussed deadline extensions for the service of supplemental
responses, but were unable to informally resolve the issues. (Ex. 5 to
Chanchikyan Decl.)  Therefore, the Court finds that counsel has satisfied the
preliminary meet and confer requirement under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300,
subdivision (b)(1) and 2033.290, subdivision (b)(1).
 
B.    
Form
Interrogatories, Set Four
 
“The party to whom interrogatories have been propounded
shall respond in writing under oath separately to each interrogatory by any of
the following: (1) An answer containing the information sought to be discovered;
(2) An exercise of the party’s option to produce writings; or (3) An objection
to the particular interrogatory.” (Code Civ Proc. § 2030.210, subd. (a).) “Each
answer in a response to interrogatories shall be as complete and
straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding party
permits.” (Code Civ Proc. § 2030.220.) “If an objection is made to an
interrogatory or to a part of an interrogatory, the specific ground for the
objection shall be set forth clearly in the response. If an objection is based
on a claim of privilege, the particular privilege invoked shall be clearly
stated.” (Code Civ Proc. § 2030.240, subd. (b).)
 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the … party to whom the interrogatories are directed …
any objection to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on
the protection for work product.” (Code Civ Proc. § 2030.090, subd. (a).) A
propounding party may move for an order compelling further responses to
interrogatories if any of the following apply: “(1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete; (2) An exercise of the option to
produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required
specification of those documents is inadequate; or (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300,
subd. (a).)
 
Here, Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set Four,
Nos. 16.2–16.8 seek Defendant’s answers regarding the causation of Plaintiff’s
injuries and damages by the subject incident, to which Defendant served
objection-only responses. (Exs. 1 and 3 to Chanchikyan Decl.) Plaintiff argues that further responses to the subject
interrogatories are warranted because
Defendant’s objections based on attorney-client privilege and the attorney work
product doctrine are meritless. “Here, Defendant has failed to meet her burden
by refusing to provide preliminary facts and a description of the information
she is withholding so Plaintiff can determine whether the information being
withheld is actually privileged.” (Pl.’s FROG Mot. 3:17–19.)
 
Defendant argues in opposition that she “will provide
verified substantive responses to Form Interrogatories (Set Four) No. 16.2-16.8
prior to the hearing of the motion. The responses are already in Plaintiff’s
possession and thus Plaintiff’s motion is moot.” (Def.’s FROG Opp. 2:11–13.)
However, Plaintiff argues in reply that the motion is not moot because “as of
the date of filing this reply, Defendant has not served Plaintiff with
substantive responses.” (Pl.’s FROG Reply 1:5–6.)
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Defendant’s
objections to the subject interrogatories are without merit, and Defendant has
failed to supplement her deficient responses. Accordingly, the Court grants
Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to Plaintiff’s Form
Interrogatories, Set Four, Nos. 16.2–16.8.
 
C.   
Requests for
Admission, Set Three 
 
California
law requires a responding party to respond to each propounded request for
admission with either a substantive answer or an objection to the particular
request. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2033.210, subd. (b).) Each substantive answer
must: “(1) Admit so much of the matter involved in the request as
is true, either as expressed in the request itself or as reasonably and clearly
qualified by the responding party; (2) Deny so much of the matter involved
in the request as is untrue; (3) Specify so much of the matter involved in
the request as to the truth of which the responding party lacks sufficient
information or knowledge.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.220,
subd. (b).) “If a responding party gives lack of information or knowledge as a
reason for a failure to admit all or part of a request for admission, that
party shall state in the answer that a reasonable inquiry concerning the matter
in the particular request has been made, and that the information known or
readily obtainable is insufficient to enable that party to admit the matter.” (Id.
at subd. (c).)
 
A
propounding party may move for an order compelling further responses to
requests for admission if any of the following apply: “(1) An answer to a
particular request is evasive or incomplete; or (2) An objection to a
particular request is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
2033.290, subd. (a).)¿
 
Here, Plaintiff seeks to
compel Defendant’s further responses to her RFAs, Set Three, Nos. 53,
57–59, 61–70, 72, and 74–85, which “seek
admissions regarding the injuries Plaintiff sustained from the subject
collision.” (Pl.’s RFA Mot. 3:16–17.) “In response to each of these requests,
Defendant claims an inability to admit or deny due to insufficient knowledge or
information. However, Discovery has been ongoing for nearly two years,
providing Defendant ample opportunity to obtain information on Plaintiff’s
injuries, which are documented in readily available medical records.” (Id. at
3:17–20.) Plaintiff further argues that Defendant’s
objections based on attorney-client privilege and the attorney work product
doctrine are meritless because “responding to discovery regarding Plaintiff’s
injuries do not pertain to communications between Defendant and her counsel,
nor does it require the disclosure of counsel’s mental impressions or opinions
of the case. Rather, these requests pertain specifically to fact-based issues
on the case, that if admitted, would save the Court and parties time and
resources should the case proceed to trial.” (Id. at 4:20–23.)
 
Defendant argues in
opposition that in her 3/25/24 further responses to the subject RFAs, “Defendant
complied with the Code’s requirement of providing a complete and
straightforward answer to Requests for Admission Nos. 53, 57–59, 61–70, 72, and
74–85. Defendant clearly specified lack of sufficient information or knowledge
as she understood it. No further responses are necessary to these requests
because Defendant already provided Code-compliant responses to the same.” (Def.’s
RFA Opp. 5:14–18.)
 
Plaintiff disagrees, arguing in reply that “Defendant
failed to state that a ‘reasonable inquiry concerning the matter in the
particular request has been made, and that the information known or readily
obtainable is insufficient to enable [Defendant] to admit the matter.’ …This is
extremely concerning given the amount of discovery that has already taken
place, including the deposition of Plaintiff, discovery responses from
Plaintiff, and multiple defense medical examinations.” (Pl.’s RFA Reply 1:19–23,
citing Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.220, subd. (c).) “Despite the extensive discovery
already conducted, Defendant attempts to justify their refusal to provide
further responses by claiming that ‘discovery is still ongoing’ and that a
neuropsychological Independent Medical Examination is still needed.” (Id.
at 2:17–19.)
 
The Court agrees with Plaintiff that Defendant’s
responses to the subject RFAs are deficient because Defendant fails to state
that “a reasonable inquiry concerning the matter in the particular request has
been made, and that the information known or readily obtainable is insufficient
to enable that party to admit the matter.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.220, subd.
(c).) The Court also finds unpersuasive the assertion that Defendant lacks the
information necessary to admit or deny the subject requests, based on the
extensive discovery efforts already taken in this action. Accordingly, the
Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s
further responses to her RFAs, Set Three, Nos. 53, 57–59, 61–70, 72, and
74–85.
 
D.   
Sanctions 
 
“The court shall impose a
monetary sanction … against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a [request or
interrogatory], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc. §
2033.290, subd. (d).) Additionally, “the court may
impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
 
Here, Plaintiff requests a
total combined sum of $3,150.00 in monetary sanctions against Defendant or her
counsel, accounting for a total of (1) 5 hours of Plaintiff’s attorney’s time
spent preparing the instant motions; (2) 2 hours reviewing Defendant’s
oppositions and preparing replies; and (3) 2 hours appearing at the instant
hearings, at counsel’s hourly billing rate of $350.00 per hour. (Chanchikyan
Decl. ¶¶ 6–9.)
 
In granting the instant
motions, the Court finds it reasonable to impose $700.00.in monetary sanctions against Defendant’s counsel.

ordered to provide further code-compliant, objection-free responses to the
following discovery requests within 30 days:
·

Form Interrogatories, Set Four, Nos. 16.2–16.8; and

Court imposes monetary sanctions against Defendant’s counsel in the amount of $700.00,
