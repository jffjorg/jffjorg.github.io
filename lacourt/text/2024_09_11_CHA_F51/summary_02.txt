```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, which seeks to add a cause of action for fraudulent concealment and a prayer for punitive damages. The Plaintiffs contend that Ford Motor Company had knowledge of a transmission defect before selling the vehicle, failed to disclose the defect to the buyers, and that the Plaintiffs experienced repair issues with the vehicle. The Defendants argued that the Plaintiffs unreasonably delayed in seeking leave to add the cause of action and that granting the motion would cause prejudice to them. The Judge found that granting the motion presents little risk of prejudicing the Defendants and that allowing the Plaintiffs to add the requested factual allegations would not "radically change" the causes of action or the issues involved. The Plaintiffs are required to separately file their proposed second amended complaint within 10 days of the hearing.
