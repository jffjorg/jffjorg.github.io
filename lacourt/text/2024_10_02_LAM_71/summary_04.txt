And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Plaintiff Mark Leonard's motion for summary judgment against Defendant Min S. Lee. The Plaintiff sought to obtain possession of the subject property, alleging that he acquired title to the property at a trustee's sale and that the Defendant remains in possession of the property. The Plaintiff argued that he properly served a three-day Notice to Quit on the Defendant and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

However, the Judge found that there exists an issue of material fact as to whether the foreclosure sale to the Plaintiff was duly perfected and deemed final. The Judge noted that the Plaintiff's title was not duly perfected and deemed final because neither TDSERVICE or its authorized agent can prove compliance with §2924m(e)(1), which requires the posting of certain information on the internet. The Judge also noted that the Plaintiff's title remains in the Defendant pursuant to Civil Code §2924m(h).

As a result, the Judge denied the Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, finding that there is an issue of material fact that precludes a grant of summary judgment. The Judge ordered the moving party to give notice.
