Legal Standard
A motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers
submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.  (C.C.P.
§437c(c).) 
 

Unlawful Detainer (1st COA)
The elements of a claim for
unlawful detainer based upon sale of real property at a trustee’s sale are set
forth in C.C.P. §1161a, and require that the plaintiff show: (1) the sale was
conducted in compliance with Civil Code §2924; (2) proper service of a notice
to quit; and (3) the defendant’s failure to vacate the subject property within
the time prescribed in the notice to quit.  (C.C.P. §1161a(b)-(c).)
A recital in the trustee’s deed
upon sale of compliance with all of the requirements of Civil Code §2924, regarding
the mailing of copies of notices, or the publication of a copy of the notice of
default, or the personal delivery of the copy of the notice of default, or the
posting of copies of the notice of sale or the publication of a copy thereof shall
constitute prima facie evidence of compliance with these requirements.  (Civ. Code §2924(c).)
Further, a provision in a deed
of trust may provide that such recitals in a trustee’s deed may be prima facie
proof of the regularity of the sale, and that no further evidence is necessary
to establish title and right to possession of the purchaser.  (Sorensen v. Hall (1934) 219 Cal. 680, 682-683; see Pacific States Savings & Loan Co. v.
O’Neill (1936) 7
Cal.2d 596, 599.)
Plaintiff submitted evidence that
he acquired title to the Subject Property at a trustee’s sale conducted in
accordance with Civil Code §2924.  Specifically,
Plaintiff submitted evidence that the Deed of Trust was secured by the Subject
Property.  (P-USSF 1.)  On February 7, 2023, Lenders T.D. Service,
Inc. was substituted as the successor trustee under the Deed of Trust and,
immediately thereafter, the trustee of the Deed of Trust recorded a Notice of
Default against the Subject Property.  (P-USSF
3-4.)  On May 17, 2023, more than 90 days
later, the trustee of the Deed of Trust recorded a Notice of Trustee’s Sale
against the Subject Property.  (P-USSF
5.)  Afterward, on January 24, 2024, the
trustee of the Deed of Trust conducted a non-judicial foreclosure sale, whereby
Plaintiff obtained ownership of the Subject Property.  (P-USSF 6.)  Finally, on April 3, 2024, a Trustee’s Deed
Upon Sale was recorded, conveying ownership of the Subject Property to
Plaintiff.  (P-USSF 7.)
The Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale
contained a recital of compliance with the Deed of Trust and Civil Code §2924.  Specifically, the recorded Trustee’s Deed Upon
Sale contains a recital of compliance with applicable law and the provisions of
the Deed of Trust, as follows:
This conveyance is made in compliance with the terms and provisions of
the Deed of Trust executed by MIN S. LEE, A MARRIED WOMAN AS HER SOLE AND
SEPARATE PROPERTY and recorded on 10/26/2022, in Book Page Instrument Number
20221020239 of Official records, in the office of the Recorder of LOS ANGELES County,
California, under the authority and powers vested in the Trustee designated in
the Deed of Trust or as the duly appointed Trustee, default having occurred
under the Deed of Trust and pursuant to the Notice of Default and Election to
Sell under the Deed of Trust recorded 02/07/2023, in Book Page Instrument
Number 20230077166 of Official records, Trustee having complied with all applicable
statutory requirements of the State of California and performed all duties
required by the Deed of Trust including sending of a Notice of Default and
Election to SELL within 10 days after its recording and a Notice of Sale at
least 20 days prior to the Sale Date by certified mail, postage pre-paid to each
person entitled to notice in compliance with California Civil Code 2924b.
 
Notice of Trustee’s Sale was published once a week for three
consecutive weeks commencing 05/23/2023 in DAILY COMMERCE, a newspaper, and at
least 20 days before the date fixed therein for sale a copy of the Notice of
Trustee’s Sale was posted in a conspicuous place on the property described
above and in one public place in the city where the sale was to be held. At the
time and place fixed in said notice, Trustee did, by public announcement, and in
said provided, postpone the sale from time to time thereafter and did sell the
property described above on 01/24/2024 at public auction to the Grantee herein.
Grantee being the highest qualified bidder therefor, for $l,422,198.92 cash,
lawful money of the United States, or by the satisfaction of the indebtedness
then secured by said Deed of Trust.
(P-USSF 8.)  
          Plaintiff
submitted evidence that he properly served a three-day Notice to Quit on
Defendant.  (P-USSF 9-10.)  Finally, Plaintiff submitted evidence that
Defendant remains in possession of the Subject Property.  (P-USSF 11.)
Plaintiff met his burden to
demonstrate there is no triable issue of material fact and it is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.  Plaintiff
shifts the burden to Defendant to raise a triable issue of material fact.  
Defendant raises a triable issue
of material fact as to whether the foreclosure sale to Plaintiff was duly
perfected and deemed final.
Civil Code §2924m, a recently enacted
California foreclosure statute made effective January 1, 2021, provides, “a
Trustee’s Sale of property under a power of sale contained in a deed of trust
or mortgage on real property containing one to four residential units pursuant
to Section 2924g shall not be deemed final” when the winning bidder, as here,
is not a prospective owner-occupant, requiring a post-sale notice of the
foreclosure in the manner and form prescribed by §2924m(e).  (See Civ. Code §2924m(c)(1).)
Civil Code §2924m illustrates
out the conditions for a sale to deemed final and sets forth the procedures in
the event the sale is not final.  (See Civ. Code §2924m(e)-(h).)  The enactment of Civil Code §2924m created a
post-sale opportunity up to 45-days for “prospective owner-occupants” of the
subject property to match the highest and best bid at the auction.  (See Civ. Code §2924m.)
The post-sale notice required by
the statutes states that the Trustee or an authorized agent, “not later than 48
hours after the Trustee’s Sale of property under §2924g, to post on the
internet website set forth in the Notice of Trustee’s Sale, a) the date on
which the trustee’s sale took place, b) the amount of the last and highest bid
at the trustee’s sale, and c) an address at which the trustee can receive documents
sent by U.S. mail and by a method of delivery providing overnight delivery.”  (See Civ. Code §2924m(e)(1).)
“The term ‘deemed final’ in
§2924m means the point in time when the foreclosure sale is considered
completed and equitable title transfers from the mortgagor/trustor to the buyer.
Thus, title in four or fewer residential units remains with the
mortgagor/trustor until the sale is ‘deemed final’ pursuant to §2924m(c). Cal.
Civ. Code § 2924m(f).”  (In re Spikes (Bankr. E.D. Cal. Aug. 5, 2024,
No. 23-21965) 2024 WL 3649505, at pg. *3.)
“‘Deemed finality’ is deferred
for up to 45 days if during the initial 15 days any eligible tenant buyer or
prospective owner-occupant (or certain related entities) submits a bid or
nonbinding written notice of intent to bid. Cal. Civ. Code §2924m(c)(4)(B); [In re Hager (Bankr. E.D. Cal. 2023) 651
B.R. 873, 882.] [¶] As noted, title to the property remains with the mortgagor
or trustor until the sale is ‘deemed final’ as provided in § 2924m. Cal. Civ.
Code § 2924m(f). [¶] This procedure for finality prevails over any conflicting
finality and perfection provisions in § 2924h. Cal. Civ. Code § 2924m(h).”  (In re Spikes, 2024 WL 3649505, at pg. *4.)
When the internet posting
requirement under §2924m(e)(1) is not made or is defective, the veracity of the
statements by the Trustee made in the Trustee’s Deed is deemed false.  “[C]onventional foreclosure law teaches that
a false trustee declaration invalidates the ensuing trustee’s deed.”  (In re Spikes, 2024 WL 3649505, at pg. *4.)  “It
is apparent that the internet posting is intended to be available to the general
public and to persons who are interested in becoming owner-occupants, rather
than real estate foreclosure portfolio investors who would not be
owner-occupants. It follows that the §2924m(e) internet announcement needs to
be in plain English and needs to be set forth in substantially the same format
as stated in the statute.”  (In re Spikes, 2024 WL 3649505, at pg. *5.)
Here, Plaintiff’s title was not
duly perfected and deemed final because neither TDSERVICE or its authorized
agent can prove compliance with §2924m(e)(1).  The website, www.servicelinkasap.com, provided
in the Notice of Trustee’s Sale in the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office,
assigned instrument number 20230320172 (“NOTS”) (Plaintiff’s Exhibit 8 at pg. 2)
does not provide the general public, in plain English and in substantially the
same format as stated in the statute, the information necessary to be in compliance.
 
Therefore, there exists an issue
of material fact as to whether Plaintiff’s sale cannot be “deemed final” under
§2924m(e), and whether title remains in Defendant pursuant to Civil Code §2924m(h).  (See In re Spikes, 2024 WL 3649505, at pgs.
*6-*7.)
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion
for summary judgement is denied.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motion for summary judgment against Defendant is denied.
Moving
Party to give notice.
