  vs.
 
HARLAN LEE, et al.


 Case
  No.:  23STCV12627
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  October 2, 2024



 
The Court denies Plaintiff’s default
judgment packet.  
The Court sets a hearing on an order
to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or Plaintiff’s
counsel sanctioned $250 for failing to enter default judgment (California Rule
of Court, rule 3.110(h)) on January 2, 2024, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at
Stanley Mosk Courthouse for the following reasons:

1.    
The request for court judgment does not properly seek an amount that is
equal to or less than the amount sought in the complaint or C.C.P. §425.11
statement of damages because there is no numerical value for damages sought in
the prayer for relief.  (See,
e.g., Falahati v. Kondo (2005)
127 Cal.App.4th 823, 830-831 [stating court acts in excess of its jurisdiction
and the resulting default judgment is void if the court awards default judgment
in an amount greater than that demanded in the complaint, including if the
complaint does not specify the amount demanded].)
