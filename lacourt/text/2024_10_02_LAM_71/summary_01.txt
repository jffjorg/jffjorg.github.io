And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment and instead has scheduled a hearing for October 2, 2024, to determine why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or the plaintiff's counsel should be sanctioned for failing to enter the default judgment on January 2, 2024. The reason for the denial is that the request for default judgment does not specify a numerical value for damages sought, which is required by California law. The judge has also cited a previous court ruling, Falahati v. Kondo, which states that a court acts in excess of its jurisdiction and the resulting default judgment is void if the court awards default judgment in an amount greater than that demanded in the complaint.
