ANALYSIS:
 
On March 15, 2021, Plaintiff Lisa Davidson (“Judgment Creditor”)
filed the instant action against Defendant Rite Aid Corporation (“Judgment
Debtor”). Default judgment was entered against Judgment Debtor on March 7,
2022.
 
On April 8, 2024,
Judgment Creditor filed
the instant Motion to Amend Judgment. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
As an initial matter, the Motion
to Amend Judgment is not accompanied by a proof of service demonstrating
service of the Motion papers or notice of the hearing date on Judgment Debtor.
Failure to give notice of a motion is not only a violation of the statutory
requirements but of due process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero
(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.) 
 
Regarding the merits, Judgment Creditor moves
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 187 to add “Thrift Payless, Inc.”
as an additional judgment debtor.
 
“Under section 187, the trial court
is authorized to amend a judgment to add additional judgment debtors.... As a
general rule, ‘a court may amend its judgment at any time so that the judgment
will properly designate the real defendants.’.... Judgments may be amended to
add additional judgment debtors on the ground that a person or entity is the
alter ego of the original judgment debtor.... ‘Amendment of a judgmentrb to add
an alter ego “is an equitable procedure based on the theory that the court is
not amending the judgment to add a new defendant but is merely inserting the
correct name of the real defendant...
 
(Greenspan v. LADT, LLC
(2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 486, 508 [citing Hall, Goodhue, Haisley & Barker,
Inc. v. Marconi Conf. Center Bd. (1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1551, 1554-1555].)
Alter ego liability exists when there is such “unity of interest” and ownership
that the individuality or separateness of the corporation has ceased to exist
(or never existed in the first place). (Mesler v. Bragg Management Co. (1985)
39 Cal.3d 290, 300.) Also, “the facts of the case must be such that adherence
to the “fiction” of the corporation's “separate existence” would sanction a
fraud or promote injustice.” (Ibid.) 
 
Judgment Creditor moves on the grounds that Thrifty
Payless, Inc. is Judgment Debtor’s business license name for the location where
the incident occurred. The Motion cites the supporting declaration of Judgment
Creditor’s attorney, Perrin Davidson and attached exhibits. (Motion, p.
3:9-15.) The exhibits demonstrate that the Sherrif’s Department would not serve
the writ of execution to enforce the judgment because the business license name
and judgment debtor name did not match. (Motion, Perrin Decl., ¶¶3-4 and Exhs.
B-C.) Judgment Creditor verified that the business license name at the subject
location is “Thrifty Payless, Inc.” (Id. at Exh. D.)
 
However, the hearing must be
continued due to lack of service of the moving papers and notice of hearing on
Judgment Debtor.
 
Conclusion
 
Judgment Creditor Lisa Davidson’s Motion to Amend Judgment is CONTINUED
TO AUGUST 5, 2024 AT 10:00 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.
BY JULY 8, 2024, JUDGMENT CREDITOR IS TO FILE A PROOF OF SERVICE DEMONSTRATING
SERVICE OF ALL THE MOTION PAPERS ON JUDGMENT DEBTOR. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY
RESULT IN THE MOTION BEING DENIED.
