ANALYSIS:
 
On September 14, 2022, Plaintiff Antonio E. Banda, Jr. (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action against Defendant Lloyd Vernis (“Defendant”).
Following Defendant’s failure to file a responsive pleading, the Court entered
default on November 1, 2022 and default judgment on January 4, 2023. 
 
Defendant filed the first Motion to Vacate Default and
Default Judgment on January 12, 2024, which the Court denied on February 8,
2024. (Minute Order, 02/08/24.) Defendant then filed a Renewed Motion to Vacate
Default and Default Judgment (“the Renewed Motion”) on February 21, 2024. The
Court denied the Renewed Motion on March 25, 2024. (Minute Order, 03/25/24.)
 
Defendant now brings the instant Motion for Reconsideration,
filed on April 3, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition on May 21, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant moves for reconsideration of the Court’s ruling on
the Renewed Motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. When a motion has been denied in
whole or in part, the moving party may apply again for the same relief at a
later time only upon “new or different facts, circumstances or law.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1008, subd. (b); see Graham v. Hansen (1982) 128 Cal.App.3d
965, 969-970.) 
 
The Court
denied the first Motion to Vacate on the grounds that it was brought under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) but was untimely. (Minute
Order, 02/08/24.) Defendant argues that the Court did not realize the Renewed
Motion to Vacate was brought on different statutory grounds from the first
Motion to Vacate. The Court finds there was confusion regarding whether the
first Motion to Vacate was denied without prejudice to Defendant bringing a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5, which is grounds for
reconsideration. The Court, therefore, will reconsider its ruling on the
Renewed Motion to Vacate by addressing the merits.
 
The Renewed Motion to Vacate is brought pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 473.5, which states: 
 
When service of a summons has not resulted
in actual notice to a party in time to defend the action and a default or
default judgment has been entered against him or
her in the action, he or she may serve and file a
notice of motion to set aside the default or default judgment and for
leave to defend the action.  The notice of
motion shall be served and filed within a reasonable time, but in no event
exceeding the earlier of: (i) two years after entry of a default judgment
against him or her; or (ii) 180 days after service on him or
her of a written notice that the default or default judgment has
been entered.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a).)
Additionally, the motion “shall be accompanied by an affidavit showing under
oath that the party’s lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was
not caused by his or her avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. Finally,
the party shall serve and file with the notice a copy of the answer, motion, or
other pleading proposed to be filed in the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5,
subd. (b).)
 
It is difficult to find that the Motion was
brought within a reasonable time. Defendant declares he only learned of this
action upon his appearance at the judgment debtor examination on October 18,
2023. (Motion, Vernis Decl., ¶5.) Service of the judgment debtor examiantion,
however, was made to the same address as the Summons and Complaint, request for
entry of default, and request for default judgment. (Proof of Personal Service,
filed 10/24/22, ¶4; Request for Entry of Default, filed 10/24/22, ¶6; Request
for Default Judgment, filed 12/02/22, ¶6; Proof of Service, filed 09/19/23, ¶3.)
Without an explanation for this discrepancy in notice, it strains credulity to
find that Judgment Debtor was unaware of any of the papers served prior to the
Application and Order for Appearance and Examination. 
 
Furthermore, the Motion is not supported by an
adequate declaration. Defendant does not show under oath that his lack of
actual notice was not caused by avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. (Motion,
Vernis Decl., ¶5.) Simply making an “adament” statement that Defendant was not
served is insufficient under the express requirements of the statute.
Therefore, Defendant has not demonstrated that he is entitled to relief under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Lloyd Vernis’ Motion for Reconsideration of the
ruling denying the Renewed Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment is GRANTED.
UPON RECONSIDERATION, THE RENEWED MOTION TO VACATE DEFAULT AND DEFAULT JUDGMENT
IS DENIED UNDER CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 473.5.
 
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
