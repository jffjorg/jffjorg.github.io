And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The judge grants the motion to deem requests for admission admitted and grants sanctions of $425.80 to the moving party's counsel. The defendant/cross-defendant, Eric Lars Larsen, is ordered to pay the sanctions within 20 days of service of this order. The motion was filed by defendants/cross-complainants Valerie J. Berry and Billie Grace Berry, who served requests for admissions on February 21, 2024, and the defendant/cross-defendant failed to timely serve verified responses, resulting in a waiver of objections. The court finds that the sanctions are justified under the moving statute and awards $425.80, based on one hour of attorney time billed at $345.00 per hour, plus costs of $80.80."
