  - "Failure to give notice of a motion is not only a violation of the statutory requirements but of due process."
  - "Under section 187, the trial court is authorized to amend a judgment to add additional judgment debtors."
  - "Judgments may be amended to add additional judgment debtors on the ground that a person or entity is the alter ego of the original judgment debtor."
  - "Amendment of a judgment to add an alter ego is an equitable procedure based on the theory that the court is not amending the judgment to add a new defendant but is merely inserting the correct name of the real defendant."
