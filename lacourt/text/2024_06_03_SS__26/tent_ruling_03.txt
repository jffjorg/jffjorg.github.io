ANALYSIS:
 
On February 21, 2024, Defendants/Cross-Complainants Valerie
J. Berry and Billie Grace Berry (erroneously sued as William R. Berry) (“the
Berrys”) served Requests for Admissions on Defendant/Cross-Defendant Erik Lars
Larsen (“Larsen”). (Motion, Marcum Decl.,
Exh. A.) To date, Larsen has not served responses to the Requests for
Admission. (Id. at ¶6.) The Berrys filed the instant Motion to Deem
Requests for Admission Admitted (“the Motion”) on April 5, 2024. No opposition
has been filed to date. 
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
Due to Larsen’s failure to timely serve verified responses and resultant waiver
of objections, the Berrys are entitled to an order deeming the Requests for
Admission admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
 
The Court is required to award sanctions under the moving
statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) While properly noticed, the
sanctions sought are excessive. Under a lodestar calculation, sanctions are
granted against Larsen in the amount of $425.80 based on one hour of attorney
time billed at $345.00 per hour, plus costs of $80.80. (Motion, Marcum Decl.,
¶8.)
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants/Cross-Complainants Valerie J. Berry and Billie
Grace Berry’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and Request for
Sanctions is GRANTED. DEFENDANT/CROSS-DEFENDANT ERIC LARS LARSEN IS ORDERED TO
PAY SANCTIONS OF $425.80 TO MOVING PARTY’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF
THIS ORDER.
