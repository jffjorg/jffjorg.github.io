And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendant's Motion for Reconsideration of the ruling denying the Renewed Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment. The Court has granted the Motion for Reconsideration, but denied the Renewed Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment. The Defendant had filed the Renewed Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment, which was denied by the Court. The Defendant then filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was granted by the Court. The Court has reconsidered its ruling on the Renewed Motion to Vacate by addressing the merits. The Court found that the Defendant had not demonstrated that he was entitled to relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5. The Court's ruling is based on the facts that the Defendant was served with the Summons and Complaint, but claimed to have only learned of the action upon his appearance at the judgment debtor examination on October 18, 2023. The Defendant did not provide an adequate declaration showing under oath that his lack of actual notice was not caused by avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect.
