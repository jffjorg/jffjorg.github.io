And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions for new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Plaintiff, Larry Waldie, is seeking to overturn the jury's verdict that found in favor of the Defendant, County of Los Angeles. The Plaintiff claims that the Defendant retaliated against him after he made a whistleblower complaint, but the jury found that the complaint did not contribute to any adverse employment actions.

The Judge has denied both motions, finding that there was substantial evidence that the decisions made by the Defendant were not based on or impacted by the whistleblower complaint. The Judge noted that the evidence showed that the decisions to select the most qualified applicants for interviews and to promote one of those candidates to Captain of the Compton station were not based on or impacted by the whistleblower complaint, and that the Department's decisions concerning transfers of Plaintiff were not motivated by any such complaint.

The Judge also noted that the trial court has limited discretion to grant a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and that it may only do so when there is no substantial evidence to support the verdict. The Judge concluded that the evidence was conflicting and that several reasonable inferences could be drawn, and therefore denied the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.
