And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions for new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Plaintiff, Larry Waldie, is seeking to overturn the jury's verdict that found in favor of the Defendant, County of Los Angeles. The Plaintiff claims that the Defendant retaliated against him after he made a whistleblower complaint, but the jury found that the complaint did not contribute to any adverse employment actions.

The Judge has denied both motions, finding that there was substantial evidence that the decisions made by the Defendant were not based on or impacted by the whistleblower complaint. The Judge noted that the evidence showed that the decisions to select the most qualified applicants for interviews and to promote one of those candidates to Captain of the Compton station were not based on or impacted by the whistleblower complaint, and that the Department's decisions concerning transfers of Plaintiff were not motivated by any such complaint.

The Judge also noted that the trial court has limited discretion to grant a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and that it may only do so when there is no substantial evidence to support the verdict. The Judge concluded that the evidence was conflicting and that several reasonable inferences could be drawn, and therefore denied the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.

**Case Number:** 20STCV24195

**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023

**Department:** 54

**Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles**

---

**Plaintiff:** Larry Waldie

**Defendant:** County of Los Angeles

---

On September 26, 2023, the court will hear Plaintiff Larry Waldie's motions for a new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict against Defendant County of Los Angeles.

**Background:**

In September 2020, Plaintiff Larry Waldie filed a whistleblower retaliation complaint against the County of Los Angeles. Waldie, a Lieutenant in the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, alleged that he was denied a promotion and transfer due to his opposition to the actions of an allegedly criminal gang, The Executioners. He claimed that the officers initiated a "work slowdown" in response to his refusal to promote a certain officer at the request of a gang leader.

**Tentative Ruling:**

1. **Motion for New Trial:**
   - Plaintiff's motion is denied.
   - Plaintiff argued that the weight of evidence showed adverse employment actions caused by retaliation for his complaint.
   - Defendant argued that substantial evidence indicated the Captain position was given to a more qualified candidate and that decision-makers were unaware of Plaintiff's complaint when making decisions.
   - The court found substantial evidence supporting the jury's finding that Plaintiff's complaint did not contribute to any adverse employment actions.

2. **Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict:**
   - Plaintiff's motion is denied.
   - The court has limited discretion to grant this motion when there is no substantial evidence to support the verdict.
   - Substantial evidence establishes that Plaintiff's complaint did not contribute to any adverse employment actions.

**Significant Statements:**

- "There was substantial evidence at trial that the decisions to select the most qualified applicants for interviews and to promote one of those candidates to Captain of the Compton station were not based on or impacted by any whistleblower complaint made by Plaintiff."
- "This is sufficient to support the jury's finding that Plaintiff's complaint did not contribute to any adverse employment actions."
