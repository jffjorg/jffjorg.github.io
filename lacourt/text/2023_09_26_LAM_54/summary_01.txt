Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied both the plaintiff's motion for a new trial and the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The plaintiff alleged that he was subjected to whistleblower retaliation and that the defendant, the County of Los Angeles, caused adverse employment actions against him. The jury previously found in favor of the defendant, determining that the plaintiff's complaint of unlawful activity did not contribute to any adverse employment actions. The judge found that there was substantial evidence to support the jury's finding, and that the plaintiff's motions did not demonstrate any error or injustice in the trial.
