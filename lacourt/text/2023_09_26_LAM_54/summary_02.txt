The judge has granted Defendant LACMTA's motions to compel responses to discovery from Plaintiff Darveonnah Miller. The discovery was served on March 22, 2023, and responses were due on June 8, 2023, but none have been received. The judge finds that Plaintiff has not yet responded to discovery and grants the motions. However, since Plaintiff represents that responses will be forthcoming, the judge denies Defendant's request for sanctions. Plaintiff is ordered to serve verified responses to the subject discovery within 15 days of notice of ruling.
