And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint without prejudice due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b). The plaintiff had sought to amend the complaint to eliminate references to defendants who had been dismissed from the case and to clarify the allegations against property owners. The judge noted that the motion was unopposed, but that the plaintiff's declaration lacked information about when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered and why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The judge ordered the plaintiff to provide notice of the ruling and file a proof of service of such.
