MOTION
 
            Plaintiff Franklyn Ardon Cruz (“Plaintiff”)
moves for leave to file a second amended complaint that eliminates references
to defendants who Plaintiff has since dismissed from the action.  (Motion at p. 3.)  Specifically, Plaintiff contends that the
“First Amended Complaint mistakenly alleges causes of action against
Plaintiff’s employer and supervisor, and mistakenly alleges that the owner of
the property is Laterra Development, LLC.” 
(Ibid.)  Plaintiff also
seeks “to clarify the allegations against property owners 12575 Venice
Investments LP and LT Building Corp.”  (Ibid.)  The motion is unopposed.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Amendments
to Pleadings: General Provisions
 
            Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (a)(1), “The court may, in furtherance of justice, and
on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or
proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a
mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may,
upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer. The court may
likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any
terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other
particulars; and may upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time
limited by this code.”
 
            To wit, without notice to the other
party the Court has wide discretion to allow either party (i) to add or strike
the name of a party or (ii) to correct a mistake in the name of a party or a
mistake in any other respect “in furtherance of justice” and “on any terms as
may be proper.” (See Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1); see also Marriage
of Liss (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1429.) Alternatively, after notice to
the other party, the Court has wide discretion to allow either party to amend
pleadings “upon any terms as may be just.” (See Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (a)(1). Similarly, Code of Civil Procedure section 576 states “Any judge,
at any time before or after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of
justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any
pleading or pretrial conference order.”
 
            Judicial policy favors resolution of
all disputed matters between the parties and, therefore, leave to amend is
liberally granted. (Berman vs. Bromberg (1986) 56 Cal.App.4th 936, 945; Hirsa
v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 488-489 [this has been an
established policy in California since 1901] (citing Frost v. Whitter
(1901) 132 Cal. 421, 424; Thomas v. Bruza (1957) 151 Cal.App.2d 150,
155).) The Court of Appeal in Morgan v. Superior Court held “If the
motion to amend is timely made and the granting of the motion will not
prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to amend and
where the refusal also results in a party being deprived of the right to assert
a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious defense, it is not only error
but an abuse of discretion.” (Morgan v. Superior Court (1959) 172
Cal.App.2d 527, 530, citations omitted.) Moreover, “it is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where the opposing party was
not misled or prejudiced by the amendment.” (Kittredge Sports Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048 [opposing party did not
establish harm by the delay in moving to amend the complaint].)
 
            “The court may grant leave to amend
the pleadings at any stage of the action.” (Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023) ¶ 6:636 (hereafter
Weil & Brown).) Denial of a motion to amend is rarely justified if the
motion is timely made and granting the motion will not prejudice the opposing
party. (Id. at ¶ 6:639, citations omitted.) However, if the party
seeking the amendment has been dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced the
opposing party, the judge has discretion to deny leave to amend. (Id. at
¶ 6:655, citations omitted. Absent prejudice, any claimed delay alone is not
grounds for denial. “If the delay in seeking the amendment has not misled or
prejudiced the other side, the liberal policy of allowing amendments prevails.
Indeed, it is an abuse of discretion to deny leave in such a case even if
sought as late as the time of trial. (Id. at ¶ 6:653 (citing Higgins
v. Del Faro (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 558, 564-565).) “Prejudice exists where
the amendment would result in a delay of trial, along with loss of critical
evidence, added costs of preparation, increased burden of discovery, etc. . . .
But the fact that the amendment involves a change in legal theory which would
make admissible evidence damaging to the opposing party is not the kind of
prejudice the court will consider.” (Weil & Brown, supra, at
¶ 6:656, citations omitted.)
 
            “Even if some prejudice is shown,
the judge may still permit the amendment but impose conditions, as the Court is
authorized to grant leave ‘on such terms as may be proper.’” (Weil &
Brown, supra, at ¶ 6:663, citation omitted.) For example, the court
may cause the party seeking the amendment to pay the costs and fees incurred in
preparing for trial. (Id. at ¶ 6:664 (citing Fuller v. Vista Del
Arroyo Hotel, 42 Cal.App.2d 400, 404).)
 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1324: Procedural Requirements
 
            Pursuant to California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324(a), a motion to amend a pleading before trial must:
 
“(1) Include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleadings,
which must be serially numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or
amendments;
(2) state what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be
deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the deleted
allegations are located; and
(3) State what allegations are proposed to be added to the previous
pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
additional allegations are located.”
 
            In addition, under Rule 3.1324(b), a
motion to amend a pleading before trial must be accompanied by a separate
declaration that specifies the following:
 
“(1) the effect of the amendment;
(2) why the amendment is necessary and proper;
(3) when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were
discovered; and
(4) the reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier.”
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff has included a copy of the
proposed second amended complaint, and described the differences between the
first amended complaint and second amended complaint as follows:
 
Paragraph 1 of the SAC is substantially similar to paragraph 1 of the
FAC, except for the elimination of references to Amera Enterprises, LLC, Oscar
Enrique Castillo, and Laterra Development, LLC, now dismissed from the case.
Paragraph 2 of the SAC is the same as paragraph 2 of the FAC. Paragraphs 3 to 6
of the FAC have been eliminated and replaced with paragraphs 3-5 of the SAC.
Paragraphs 7-9 of the FAC are now substantially similar to paragraphs 6-8 of
the SAC. Paragraphs 10-23 of the FAC have been replaced by paragraphs 9- 28 of
the SAC, with all allegations against Amera Enterprises, LLC, Oscar Enrique
Castillo, and Laterra Development, LLC, eliminated, and the cause of action for
negligence being alleged only against Defendants 12575 Venice Investments LP,
LT Building Corp., and DOES 3 through 50. Paragraphs 29-40 of the SAC are
substantially similar to paragraphs 24-34 of the FAC, except with all
allegations against Amera Enterprises, LLC, Oscar Enrique Castillo, and Laterra
Development, LLC, eliminated, and the cause of action for premises liability
being alleged only against Defendants 12575 Venice Investments LP, LT Building
Corp., and DOES 3 through 50.
 
(Motion
at p. 4.)  
 
Plaintiff has provided a declaration describing the effect of the
amendment and why the amendment is necessary and proper.  (See generally Torres Decl.)  However, the declaration does not indicate
when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered or why
the request for amendment was not made earlier. 
Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion fails to fully comply with Rule
3.1324(b).  
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
            Therefore, the Court denies
Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend without prejudice for failure to comply
with Rule 3.1324(b).
 
            The Court orders Plaintiff to
provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof of service of such.
