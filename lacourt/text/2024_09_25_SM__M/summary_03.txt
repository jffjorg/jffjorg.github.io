Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively sustained the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Andrino against the City of Santa Monica and others. The demurrer was filed on the grounds that the complaint fails to state a cause of action. The judge found that the complaint lacks particularized facts to support the claim of a dangerous condition of public property. The judge also found that the complaint's allegations of negligence are too general and do not specify how the condition constituted a dangerous condition. The judge is not inclined to grant leave to amend the complaint, as it would require the plaintiff to provide new facts that are not fairly reflected in the government claim.
