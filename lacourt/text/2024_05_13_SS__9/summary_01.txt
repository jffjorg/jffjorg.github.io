If the name is clear and correctly spelled, no appearance is necessary. If not, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name."
