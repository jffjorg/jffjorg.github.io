And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is issued by the Judge in response to a petition. The Judge has found that the criminal history assessment form submitted by the Clerk's office is incomplete. Specifically, the form fails to indicate whether the Petitioner is a registered sex offender and does not include a report from CLETS indicating whether there are any hits on sex/arson registration. As a result, the Judge has ordered the Clerk's office to re-run the criminal history assessment and provide a clear notation of the Petitioner's criminal history. The petition is continued to a new hearing date of June 3, 2024, and the Court Clerk is instructed to notify the parties involved.
