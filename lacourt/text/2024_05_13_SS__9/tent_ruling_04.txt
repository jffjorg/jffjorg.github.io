 Case Number:  24STCP00138    Hearing Date:   May 13, 2024    Dept:  9 The criminal
history form is incomplete as the Clerk’s office failed to check off on the
criminal history assessment form whether Petitioner is a registered sex
offender or not.  In addition, the criminal
history check appears incomplete as the Clerk’s office failed to include the
report from CLETS indicating whether there are “no hits on sex/arson registration.”
The petition is
continued to June 3, 2024 at 9:30 am. 
The Clerk’s Office must re-run the criminal history assessment and
provide more clear notation whether Petitioner has any convictions, including
for offenses that require sex offender registration.
Court Clerk to give
notice.
