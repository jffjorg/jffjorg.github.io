And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

"The court has determined that the petitioner has an active outstanding warrant with a bail amount of $30,000.00. As a result, the court will not rule on the petition for name change until the outstanding bench warrant is fully addressed and resolved. The court has continued the OSC and hearing on the petition for name change to July 8, 2024 at 9:30 am. The petitioner must file written proof that the outstanding bench warrant has been fully addressed and resolved at least two weeks prior to the continued OSC and hearing. Failure to do so will result in the OSC and hearing being taken off calendar. The court clerk will run a new criminal history assessment prior to the continued OSC to verify that the bench warrant has been cleared. Notice will be given to all parties."
