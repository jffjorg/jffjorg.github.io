I.           
INTRODUCTION
The Complaint filed on
August 29, 2022, arises from a motor vehicle accident that occurred on July 21,
2022.  Defendant Clayton Damian Fischer allegedly made an unsafe and
illegal left turn, colliding with Plaintiff Michael William Wilson
(“Plaintiff”).  Plaintiff alleges claims for negligence, intentional
infliction of emotional distress, negligent entrustment, and negligent hiring. 
At the time of the collision, Fischer was allegedly working in the course and
scope of his employment with co-defendant Southwark Metal Manufacturing.  
On October 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed
this motion to compel responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set Two
from defendant Southwark Metal Manufacturing (“Defendant”). On October 31,
2023, Defendant opposed. On November 7, 2023, Plaintiff replied. 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
A party must respond to a request for
production of documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.260, subd. (a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents
is directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move
for an order compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (b).) The party also waives the right to make any objections,
including one based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (a).) A motion to compel responses
is not subject to a 45–day time limit, and the propounding party does not have
to demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a ‘meet and confer’
requirement.”¿ (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.)¿ Also, “[a] separate statement is not required when no response
has been provided to the request for discovery.”¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b).)
III.       
DISCUSSION
Here, Plaintiff served Requests for
Production of Documents, Set Two, on Defendant on July 5, 2023. (Decl. Soofer ¶ 9.) At the time of filing the
Motion, Plaintiff
declared that he had not received a response, nor was an extension granted. (Id.
at ¶¶ 11, 12.) 
In opposition, Defendant argues
that on October 31, 2023, it served responses to Plaintiff’s request. (Decl. Arevalo
¶ 6, Ex. B.)  
In reply, Plaintiff contends that,
in fact, what he received was a “document dump” that is not code compliant.  Plaintiff also contends that the written
response he received, which he contends was not served on him, was not code
compliant and the privilege log was not code compliant.  Having reviewed the written response, the Court
is not persuaded it is insufficient.  The
privilege log appears to be missing appropriate information.  
The Court will seek to assist the
parties in finding a resolution to the issues raised at the hearing on the
motion to compel and, if necessary, hear argument on a more formal ruling on
the motion.  
IV.        
CONCLUSION
No tentative ruling; parties are ordered
to appear at the hearing.
Dated this 9h day of November 2023
