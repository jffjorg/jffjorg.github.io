The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motor vehicle accident on July 21, 2022, in which the plaintiff, Michael William Wilson, alleges claims for negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent entrustment, and negligent hiring against the defendant, Clayton Damian Fischer, and his employer, Southwark Metal Manufacturing. The plaintiff filed a motion to compel responses to his request for production of documents, set two, which was opposed by the defendant. The judge has reviewed the documents and finds that the defendant's response is incomplete and not code compliant, but notes that the privilege log appears to be missing appropriate information.
