And here is a summary in English text:

Judge Hon. Lee S. Arian has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Abraham Macias v. Antonino Silva, et al. Defendant Silva has moved to dismiss the action for delay in prosecution, arguing that the plaintiff has failed to bring the action to trial within two years of its commencement. The court has considered the facts of the case, including the plaintiff's death, and has denied the motion to dismiss. The court has found that the delay in prosecution was due to the plaintiff's death and that it would not be in the interest of justice to dismiss the action at this time. The case will proceed, and the parties are directed to submit on the tentative ruling.
