  Case Number:  23SMCV03985    Hearing Date:   June 24, 2024    Dept:  I The parties were trying to continue the matter but the
request was denied.  Even so, as it turns
out, the court will be engaged in trial on the date currently set.  Accordingly, the court will need to CONTINUE
the trial date after all.  Because the
court is continuing the trial date on its own motion, there will be no
consequence for the failure to file timely FSC materials.  The court will therefore VACATE the trial
date.  A Trial Setting Conference will be
set for May 28, 2024, at 8:30 am.  There
will be no hearing today.
