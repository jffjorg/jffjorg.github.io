```

The judge's tentative ruling is that the City of Torrance's demurrer to the third amended complaint is sustained without leave to amend. The ruling states that the causes of action for discrimination and failure to accommodate are barred by the statute of limitations and that the allegations of the third amended complaint do not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court also notes that the plaintiff failed to allege facts to demonstrate notice and a request for accommodation, and facts to show that he would have been able to perform the essential functions of the position.
