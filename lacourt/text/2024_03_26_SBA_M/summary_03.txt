And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Tesla, Inc.'s petition to compel arbitration without prejudice. The motion was made to compel arbitration of Plaintiff Bret Jason Lieberman's claims against Tesla Motors, Inc. The judge found that there is no entity named "Tesla, Inc." that has been named in the Complaint nor served with the Complaint, and therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice to a properly brought motion by the named Defendant. The judge also noted that if the Defendant is not properly named and identified by the Plaintiff, the proper procedural method to address this defect may be raised by the appropriate party or parties.
