And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the petition to confirm arbitration award and the petition to vacate arbitration award. The petitioner, Victorville/Desert Springs, L.P. and Affordable Multi-Family, LLC, is seeking to confirm the arbitration award in the amount of $813,903.62. The respondent, Baronet & Co., Inc., is seeking to vacate the arbitration award.

The judge has granted the petitioner's motion to confirm the arbitration award and denied the respondent's petition to vacate the arbitration award. The judge found that the respondent failed to meet its burden to show that the arbitrator exceeded her powers, that the award violates respondent's statutory rights, that the award violates a well-defined public policy, and that the award does not bear a rational relationship to the contract.

The judge also found that the arbitrator's decision is final and conclusive, and that the parties agreed to submit their disputes to arbitration. The judge noted that the arbitrator's decision cannot be reviewed for errors of fact or law, and that the instant Court cannot review the arbitrator's alleged error in law.

The judge's ruling is based on the parties' agreement to submit their disputes to arbitration, and the arbitrator's decision is binding, whether or not correct. The judge's ruling is in line with established case law, which confirms that errors in law or fact cannot be disturbed by the trial court.
