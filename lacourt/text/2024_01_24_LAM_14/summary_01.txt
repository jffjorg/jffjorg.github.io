Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Cross-Defendant Midvale, an insurer, arguing that it cannot be sued in the same action as its insured. The judge sustains the demurrer, but only because the Cross-Complaint lacks specific pleading of the indemnity contract between MRO and Midvale. The judge allows the Cross-Complainant 10 days to amend the complaint. The judge notes that the real problem is that the Cross-Complaint does not contain specific pleading of the indemnity contract or any discussion of Midvale. The judge suggests that the parties address the issue of prejudice that may occur if all claims are tried at the same time to the same jury in a motion to bifurcate.
