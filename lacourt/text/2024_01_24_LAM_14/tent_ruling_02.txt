(1)       Polesie Demurrer
 
Defendants
Terry Polesie (“Polesie”) and Surf Realty Corporation (“Surf Realty”) demur to
Plaintiff’s SAC, on the grounds that it fails to state facts sufficient to
constitute causes of action and is uncertain. 
 
Decision
 
            The demurrer is SUSTAINED, with 20 days leave to
amend.
 
Discussion
 
            This is the second demurrer that this court has heard
from these parties. On October 17, 2023, the court sustained the previous
demurrer on the grounds that (a) the complaint listed 22 different defendants
but really only talked about four of them and (b) Plaintiff had clearly failed
to plead the fraud claims.
 
            The SAC brings Plaintiff’s theory into a bit more focus,
but still not quite enough to enable a proper response. Plaintiff alleges a
grand conspiracy between 20 defendants across three rental complexes designed
expel an unspecified number of tenants from rent-controlled apartments. (SAC
¶¶ 41-52). The problem comes when Plaintiff tries to translate this story
into separate causes of action against individual defendants.
 
            Plaintiff only ever lived in one of these units. (SAC
¶ 53). That unit was only ever owned by Defendants Ilana Yamtoobian,
Rebecca Duel, and Urban Developer, LLC. (SAC ¶ 55). Plaintiff alleges that
she spoke with Defendants Ilana Yamtoobian (SAC ¶ 57) and David Duel (SAC
¶ 61). It appears that Plaintiff’s theory of liability against the
remaining defendants is conspiracy.
 
            Civil conspiracy is not an independent cause of action,
but a means of imposing vicarious liability upon persons who have not committed
a tort themselves, but “share with the immediate tortfeasors a common plan or
design” to commit the tort. AREI II Cases (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th
1004, 1021. To impose liability under a civil conspiracy theory, plaintiff must
allege (1) the formation and operation conspiracy, (2) wrongful conduct in
furtherance of the conspiracy, and (3) resulting damages. Id. at 1022. Additionally,
a Defendant can only be held liable via conspiracy if they are legally capable
of committing the underlying tort themselves. Applied Equipment Corp. v.
Litton Saudi Arabia Ltd. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 503, 511. 
 
Defendants
Polesie and Surf Realty are alleged to be “owners of properties” (SAC ¶ 52),
but it is clear that they were never the owners of Plaintiff’s home. They
cannot be liable to Plaintiff for the breach of any landlord-tenant regulations
because they were never her landlord and are legally incapable of breaching
obligations they never owed her. That would plainly eliminate most of Plaintiff’s
claims.
 
Further,
Plaintiff has not alleged that any conduct of Polesie and Surf Realty contributed
to her damages. Plaintiff has alleged that Polesie and Surf Realty targeted the
tenants in their buildings (SAC ¶ 52), but she has not alleged that they took
any action or formed any agreement with regard to her building.   
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff
needs to go through the SAC and realistically focus her claims. It is not
sufficient to allege a conspiracy in conclusory terms and then attempt to
impose liability for every alleged tort on every member of the conspiracy. Therefore,
the demurrer is SUSTAINED, with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
(2)       Polesie Motion to Strike
 
            Defendants Polesie and Surf Realty now move this court
for an order striking portions of the SAC.
 
Decision
 
            The motion is TAKEN OFF-CALENDAR as MOOT.
