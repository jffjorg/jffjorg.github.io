Significant Statements:
  - The SAC brings Plaintiff's theory into a bit more focus, but still not quite enough to enable a proper response.
  - Plaintiff needs to go through the SAC and realistically focus her claims.
  - It is not sufficient to allege a conspiracy in conclusory terms and then attempt to impose liability for every alleged tort on every member of the conspiracy.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has sustained the demurrer filed by defendants Terry Polesie and Surf Realty Corporation, with 20 days leave to amend. The court has also taken off-calendar the motion to strike filed by the same defendants, as it is now moot. The plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (SAC) fails to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action and is uncertain. The court finds that the plaintiff's theory of liability against the remaining defendants is based on a conspiracy, but the SAC does not adequately plead the formation and operation of the conspiracy, nor does it allege wrongful conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy. Additionally, the SAC does not allege that any conduct of Polesie and Surf Realty contributed to the plaintiff's damages, and they are legally incapable of breaching obligations they never owed the plaintiff. The court orders the plaintiff to revise the SAC to focus her claims and to allege specific facts supporting her conspiracy theory.
