And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for an order requiring the plaintiff to post an undertaking in the amount of $200,000. The defendants argued that they had a reasonable possibility of obtaining judgment in their favor because the plaintiff had failed to produce any evidence of a written or oral agreement in their action for breach of contract. The plaintiff had offered documentary evidence in the form of text messages and email correspondence, but the judge found that this evidence did not demonstrate that the defendants had no reasonable possibility of obtaining judgment in their favor. The judge also noted that the defendants had failed to substantiate the amount requested, and that there was no basis for recovering attorney's fees. The judge found that the defendants would need to show a stronger possibility of success in order to justify the amount of the undertaking.
