Background
            On
August 31, 2010, Plaintiff Alfredo Garcia (Plaintiff) sued Defendants Jun H.
Lee, Hye J. Lee (Defendants), and Does 1 through 20, inclusive, for $4,000.00
in relief based on violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act. (Civ. Code §§ 51,
52.)
            On
April 4, 2011, the court entered default judgment as to Plaintiff’s claim
against Defendants in the amount of $4,330.00, including $4,000.00 in damages
and $330.00 in attorney’s fees. And on May 6, 2011, Plaintiff filed an
Acknowledgement of Assignment of Judgment with the court, stating that
Plaintiff was assigning his right, title, and interest in the judgment
consisting of $4,330.00 to a third-party collections service, Ex Parte
Collection Services, LLC (Assignee). (Civ. Proc. § 673; Acknowledgement of Assignment
of Judgement, p. 2:1–3.)
            On
July 5, 2016, Assignee filed a Memorandum of Costs After Judgment seeking an
additional $3,244.51, including $968.00 in post-judgment costs, which consisted
of $25.00 for preparing and issuing an abstract of judgment, $33.00 for
recording and indexing such abstract of judgment, $900.00 in attorney’s fees
for work from July 5, 2014 through July 5, 2016, and $10 in statutorily
authorized costs, as well as $2,276.51 in accrued interest on the original,
unpaid judgment.
            On
April 17, 2020, Assignee filed another Memorandum of Costs After Judgment
seeking an additional $5,353.05, including $1,443.00 in post-judgment costs,
which consisted of the $968.00 previously prayed for and $475.00 in attorney’s
fees for work from May 1, 2018 through April 12, 2020, as well as $3,910.05 in
accrued interest on the original, unpaid judgment. 
On April 17,
2020, Assignee also filed a Renewal of Judgment for $9,728.05, including
$4,330.00 in the original judgment, $1,443.00 in the cited post-judgment costs,
$3,910.05 in accrued interest, and $45.00 in costs for filing the renewal
application. On April 28, 2020, the court approved Plaintiff’s application for
the Renewal of Judgment.
On October 1,
2020, the California Secretary of State suspended Assignee’s powers and
privileges based on nonpayment of taxes to the Franchise Tax Board.
(Declaration of Alfredo Garcia (Garcia Decl.) ¶ 3; Exh. 1; Exh. 2.)
 
Discussion
On August 16,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion seeking to reassign right, title, and
interest in the judgment from Assignee back to Plaintiff. Plaintiff contends
that, because of Assignee’s disenfranchisement by the California Secretary of
State, Assignee is no longer able to fulfill its obligation to collect or
enforce the judgment on Plaintiff’s behalf. (Exh. 2; Exh. 3; see Rev. &
Tax. Code, § 23301; Reed v. Norman (1957) 48 Cal.2d 338, 342; Bourhis
v. Lord (2013) 56 Cal.4th 320, 324; Color-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams (1996)
44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603-1604; Cal-Western Business Services, Inc. v.
Corning Capital Group (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 304.) Despite this
impossibility of performance, Plaintiff contends that Assignee has repeatedly failed
to respond to Plaintiff’s requests to reassign judgment back to Plaintiff.
(Exh. 3.) Accordingly, Plaintiff contends that the court has authority, in
equity, to issue an order reassigning the judgment back to Plaintiff because,
if not, the judgment will be null and void. Assignee has entered no opposition.
California courts have inherent equitable and statutory powers and
jurisdiction to enforce and compel obedience to their judgments, orders, and
process. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 128(a)(4), 177, 187.; Security
Trust & Sav. Bank v. Southern Pac. R.R. Co. (1935) 6 Cal.App.2d 585,
588; Brown v. Brown (1971) 22 Cal.App.3d 82, 84; Blueberry
Properties, LLC v. Chow (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 1017, 1020–21; Goldman
v. Simpson (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 255, 263-264; Tide Water Associated
Oil Co. v. Superior Court (Los Angeles) (1955) 43 Cal.2d 815, 825; Phillips,
Spallas & Angstadt, LLP v. Fotouhi (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 1132,
1142-1143; Yolanda's, Inc. v. Kahl & Goveia Comm'l Real Estate
(2017) 11 Cal.App.5th 509, 514; Estrada v. Royalty Carpet Mills, Inc.
(2024) 15 Cal.App.5th 582, 597-598; Torjesen v. Mansdorf (2016) 1
Cal.App.5th 111, 118.)
            Further,
a creditor who assigns his rights and interests in collection to an assignee
still “retains an equitable interest in the thing assigned.” (Clark v.
Andrews, (1952) 109 Cal.App.2d 193, 199; National
Reserve Co. of America v. Metropolitan Trust Co. of Cal.
(1941) 17 Cal.2d 827, 831; Rauer's Law & Collection Co. v. Higgins
(1946) 76 Cal.App.2d 854, 857.) Such assignment of rights to a collection
assignee creates a fiduciary relationship between assignor and asignee. (Cross
v. Bonded Adjustment Bureau (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 266, 276-277; Harrison
v. Adams (1942) 20 Cal.2d 646, 650.) Under California law, such a
relationship binds “one of the parties … to act with the utmost good faith for
the benefit of the other party.” Wolf v. Superior Court (2003) 107
Cal.App.4th 25, 29, internal citations and quotations omitted.) Ultimately,
“whether the defendant breached that duty towards the plaintiff is a question
of fact.” (Marzec v. Public Employees’ Retirement System (2015) 236
Cal.App.4th 889, 915, internal citation omitted.)
            Here,
justice requires that Plaintiff’s right, title, and interest in the judgment
filed April 4, 2011 be reassigned back to Plaintiff from Assignee. As stated in
Cross, it is well established under California law that the assignment
of a right in judgment to a collection agency creates a fiduciary relationship
between the assignor and assignee, and protects the assignor’s equitable
interest in the judgment. (Cross, supra, at 276–77.) Further, like in Cross,
Assignee Ex Parte Collections Agency failed to take appropriate actions in line
with the basic obligations of agency, including an obligation to obey requests
to cancel the relationship upon multiple requests of the original interest
holder when the assignee is in material breach of its obligations. (Id.
at 282.) 
At present,
Plaintiff’s evidence demonstrates that Assignee is in material breach of its
obligations because it is legally unable to perform, but, despite this material
breach, has repeatedly failed to respond to Plaintiff’s demands to reassign the
judgment back to Plaintiff. (Exh. 3; Garcia Decl. ¶¶ 3–8.) Further, such
material breach has caused the Court’s judgment to be rendered null and void in
effect because no party has the legal right to collect on the judgment.
Therefore, in the interest of justice, the court GRANTS Plaintiff’s
motion to order reassignment of the judgment back to Plaintiff.
 
            It
is so ordered.
