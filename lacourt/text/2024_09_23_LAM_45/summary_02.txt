And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to reassign the judgment back to the plaintiff. The plaintiff had assigned the judgment to Ex Parte Collection Services, LLC, but the assignee has failed to respond to the plaintiff's requests to reassign the judgment back to the plaintiff. The assignee's powers and privileges were also suspended due to nonpayment of taxes. The judge has determined that the assignee is in material breach of its obligations and has failed to take appropriate actions to collect the judgment. As a result, the judgment is rendered null and void, and the court has granted the plaintiff's motion to reassign the judgment back to the plaintiff.
