And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the action. The plaintiff, Kail De Lyon, had filed a complaint against his former employers, Juanita Foods and Aerotek Professional Services, as well as his coworkers, Ed Levasseur and Gerald DeVual. The plaintiff's counsel made a clerical error in selecting the option to dismiss the entire action, instead of just the complaint, and the court found that this error was excusable. The court also found that the plaintiff's motion was timely filed and that none of the defendants opposed the motion. The judge granted the motion in the interest of justice, allowing the action to proceed.
