And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a dispute between Sammy Eghablieh and Wendy Ann Walker over the partition of jointly owned property. Eghablieh sued Walker seeking to partition the property, while Walker cross-claimed for breach of fiduciary duty and punitive damages. The court has ruled that Walker's allegations are sufficient to establish that Eghablieh owed Walker a fiduciary duty based on their Domestic Partnership agreement and the entrustment of property to Eghablieh. The court has also ruled that Walker's allegations do not support an award of punitive damages against Eghablieh. Walker is directed to file and serve an amended cross-complaint by May 31, 2024.
