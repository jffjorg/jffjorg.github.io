```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court is ordering the plaintiff to provide further responses to certain Form Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents without objection. The court is also directing the plaintiff to provide specific responsive documents by Bates number, rather than referencing the same range of documents for every request. The court is not compelling the plaintiff to provide further responses to all Form Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents without objection, as the plaintiff's objections lack merit. Additionally, the court is ordering the plaintiff to provide further responses to all Requests for Production of Documents, without objections (except for objections based on the attorney-client privilege where applicable), and with reference to specific responsive documents by Bates number. The court is also inclined to continue the hearing to allow defendant's counsel to provide supplemental declarations regarding the reasonableness of his billing rate.
