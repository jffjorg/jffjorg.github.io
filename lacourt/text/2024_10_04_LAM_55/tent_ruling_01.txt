  Case Number:  18STCV02561    Hearing Date:   October 4, 2024    Dept:  55 18STCV02561
Motion to be Relieved as Attorney of Record
 
This is a post-judgment employment case in which counsel
for Plaintiff/Judgment Creditor has filed a motion to be relieved as counsel. 
“The determination whether to grant or deny an
attorney’s motion to withdraw as counsel of record lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court, having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.” Lempert v. Sup. Ct.
(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173. 
Here, the form notice, declaration, proposed order,
and proof of service sufficiently comply with the requirements for a motion to
be relieved as counsel. See
Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. 
No opposing document has been filed showing any
prejudice to the client. See Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1.16(d). 
Therefore, the motion is granted, and the Court will
sign the proposed order submitted by counsel.
