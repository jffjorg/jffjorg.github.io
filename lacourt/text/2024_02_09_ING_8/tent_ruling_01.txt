MOTION:¿                              (1) Motion for Mandatory Relief,

SCM’s Request for Attorneys’ Fees
 
Tentative Rulings:                  (1) Plaintiff’s Motion for
Mandatory Relief, pursuant to section 473(b) from this Court’s November 15,
2023 order sustaining Defendants Demurrers and motion to Strike is GRANTED.
                                                (2)
SCM’s Request for Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED in the amount of $4,000, payable
by Plaintiff’s counsel to defendant’s counsel by March 8, 2024.  The Court will entertain oral argument as to
the next steps, i.e., should the Court order a renamed document to be filed
called the “Corrected” Third Amended Complaint and set a hearing on the
already-filed demurrers and motion to strike that TAC?  Should there be additional briefing on the Demurrers
and motion to strike, or should the Court simply take under submission the already-filed
pleadings motions and issue a ruling that will be remarkably similar to its
November 15, 2023 Minute Order?
