The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Ocean Recovery, LLC v. Sullivan Curtis Monroe Insurance Services, LLC and Scottsdale Indemnity Company. The case involves a motion for mandatory relief from the Court's November 15, 2023 order sustaining the defendants' demurrers and motion to strike, as well as a request for attorneys' fees from SCM. The judge has granted both the motion for mandatory relief and the request for attorneys' fees in the amount of $4,000, payable by March 8, 2024. The judge will entertain oral argument on the next steps, including whether to order a renamed document called the "Corrected" Third Amended Complaint and set a hearing on the already-filed demurrers and motion to strike. The judge also leaves open the option for additional briefing on the demurrers and motion to strike, or to simply take the pleadings under submission and issue a ruling similar to the previous minute order.
