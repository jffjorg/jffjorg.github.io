And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Defendant Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc., granting its motion to quash service of summons and dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The Plaintiff, Chris Szajner, filed an action against Defendant and several other defendants, alleging causes of action such as battery, negligence, and breach of contract, stemming from bedbug bites he sustained while staying at a hotel owned and operated by Defendant. Defendant argued that it did not have sufficient contacts in California to establish jurisdiction, and the court agreed, finding that Plaintiff did not meet his burden of establishing jurisdiction over Defendant. The court granted Defendant's motion, quashing service of summons and dismissing the action as to Defendant.
