And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the judge's thoughts on a motion for terminating, issue, or evidentiary sanctions, or monetary sanctions filed by the plaintiffs against General Motors LLC. The plaintiffs claim that General Motors LLC failed to comply with discovery orders, including providing unverified responses and withholding documents. The judge agrees that sanctions are warranted but is hesitant to impose issue or evidentiary sanctions, which would conclusively establish certain facts. Instead, the judge is inclined to take an incremental approach by imposing monetary sanctions. The judge also notes that the plaintiffs' request for a prospective $500 per day sanction is improperly noticed and unsupported, and therefore, the hearing is continued to allow the plaintiffs to submit a supplemental declaration supporting their request. The judge also permits the defendant to file a supplemental brief in response to the declaration.
