      CASE NO.: 23AHCV00814
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED 
 
Dept.
  3
8:30
  a.m.
January
   4, 2024




 


 


 



 
Stanley
 Bowman seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for plaintiffs
 Cheryl Grady and Jason Grady (collectively, “Plaintiffs”). The motions
do not comply with CRC 3.1632 because they do not include complete proposed
orders prepared on Form MC-053; counsel omits the discovery motion hearings on 3-4-24,
4-30-24, and 5-1-24. Accordingly, these motions cannot be granted at this time.
Instead, the hearing is continued to January 5, 2024; not later than 12:00 noon
today, counsel shall file revised proposed orders. The proposed orders must
specify all currently scheduled hearing dates, including the upcoming status
conference, discovery motions, final status conference, and trial date.
Moving party to give notice.
 
Dated
this 4th
day of January 2024
