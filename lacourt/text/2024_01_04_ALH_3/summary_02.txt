And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling in this case, Case Number 23AHCV00814, relates to a motion by Stanley Bowman to be relieved as counsel of record for plaintiffs Cheryl Grady and Jason Grady. The motion does not comply with California Rules of Court 3.1632 because it lacks complete proposed orders and omits discovery motion hearings scheduled for March 4, April 30, and May 1. As a result, the hearing is continued to January 5, 2024, and the parties are required to file revised proposed orders that specify all currently scheduled hearing dates, including the status conference, discovery motions, final status conference, and trial date.
