[TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING THE HEARING FOR PETITION FOR CHANGE
OF NAME 
              Petitioner, Tayna
 Lavon King, filed this Petition on March 5,
 2024, for an order changing her name to Tanya
 Lavon King to amend the spelling of her first name on her birth
 certificate.  Petitioner is over
the age of 18. 
The court previously continued the
hearing to permit Petitioner to resolve an active warrant in Case No. LAM93V 0206401
(Los Angeles) dated February 24, 1993, regarding a driver’s license infraction.
The court’s file does not reflect that Petitioner resolved the warrant.
Accordingly, the Court continues
the hearing to July 23, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the
Compton courthouse to confirm Petitioner’s resolution of the warrant.
