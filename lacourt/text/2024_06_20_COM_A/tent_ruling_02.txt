[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION
 TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF 
 
Malek H.
 Shraibati and BDJ&J, as counsel for Plaintiff,
requests an order to be relieved because of a breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship. The court previously heard this motion on May 24, 2024, which the
court continued for counsel to establish the client’s last known address, which
counsel was not able to confirm. 
On May 10, 2024, counsel filed a declaration
confirming the Plaintiff’s last known address. As all requirements for relief
are met, the motion is GRANTED. (California Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1362.
) The order is effective upon the filing of the proof of service of the signed
order upon the client. Moving party is ordered to give notice.
