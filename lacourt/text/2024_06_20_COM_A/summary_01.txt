And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the Judge regarding a lawsuit between Michael Brian Smith, the plaintiff, and Seiko Epson Corporation, the defendant. The plaintiff alleges that he was racially profiled, targeted, and harassed by Rodger, a manager at Seiko. He further alleges defamation, willful and wanton conduct, and punitive damages. The defendant, Seiko Epson Corporation, filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the plaintiff's complaint does not state a cause of action. The Judge has granted the motion, finding that the plaintiff's allegations do not support a claim for defamation, willful and wanton conduct, and punitive damages. The Judge also finds that the plaintiff's claims for harassment and retaliation are not supported by the allegations. The Judge concludes that the motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted without leave to amend.
