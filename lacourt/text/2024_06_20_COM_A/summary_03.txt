The tentative ruling states that the hearing for the petition for change of name from Tayna Lavon King to Tanya Lavon King will be continued to July 23, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton courthouse. The reason for the continuance is that the petitioner has an active warrant from 1993 regarding a driver's license infraction, and the court needs to confirm that the warrant has been resolved before proceeding with the hearing.
