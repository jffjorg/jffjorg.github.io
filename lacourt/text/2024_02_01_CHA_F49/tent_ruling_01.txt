INTERROGATORIES

Albert Gonzalez, Jr.
RESPONDING
PARTY: Plaintiff Daniel Torres
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED
Plaintiff’s
further responses to certain discovery responses, as well as sanctions
 
SUMMARY OF
ACTION
On August 4,
2023, Defendant Albert Gonzalez, Jr., (Defendant) propounded an initial set of
discovery, including form interrogatories and requests for admission, on
Plaintiff Daniel Torres (Plaintiff). Plaintiff denied all 35 requests for
admission. Form Interrogatory Number 17.1 requested that Plaintiff provide
facts supporting his answers to the requests for admission, specifically
requests 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 27. Initially, Plaintiff responded by
saying “not applicable.” After meeting and conferring, Plaintiff provided
supplemental responses, but Defendant argues that those responses remain
inadequate.
 
In the separate
statement to Plaintiff’s opposition, Plaintiff appears to attempt to expand
upon some of his answers. However, Defendant argues in reply that these
responses are not in the proper format and are unverified. 
 
The following
is an example of one of the responses at issue:
 
Form Interrogatory
Number 17.1 (Related to Bequest Numbers 17, 19-24 & 27) 
Is
your response to each Request for Admission served with these Interrogatories
an unqualified admission? If not, for each response that is not an unqualified
admission: 
(a) State the number of the request; 
(b) State all facts upon which you base
your response; 
(c) State the name, ADDRESS, and telephone
number of all PERSONS who have knowledge of those facts; and 
(d) Identify all DOCUMENTS and other
tangible things that support your response and stat the name, ADDRESS, and
telephone number of the PERSON who has each DOCUMENT or thing. 
 
Request for
Admission Number 17: 
Admit
that YOU did not suffer any damages as a result of any actions by Evangelina
Gonzalez. 
 
Response to
Request for Admission Number 17: 
Deny.

 
Response to
Form Interrogatory #17.1 Related to Request for Admission Number 17: 
(a)
17 
(b)
The extent of the damage is unknown. 
(c)
Daniel Torres 621 Harps St. San Fernando, CA 91340, Albert Gonzalez Jr. 13351
Bradley Ave Sylmar, CA 91342, Evangelina Gonzalez 27545 Trail Ridge Road Canyon
Country, CA 91387 
(d)
See documents produced in discovery, TORRES-000067-000278.
 
The part of the
response to which Defendant takes issue is “(b) The extent of the damage is
unknown.” Plaintiff argues that this is not responsive to the request to “State
all facts upon which you base your response.” Rather than stating facts that
provide a basis for damages, Plaintiff says that the extent of the damages is
unknown. This is not responsive to Defendant’s question.
 
All of
Plaintiff’s responses that are at issue were answered in this manner. For
instance, Request for Admission Number 19 was “Admit that Albert Gonzalez, Jr.
is not liable to YOU for Breach of Fiduciary Duty.” Plaintiff denied the
request. Plaintiff’s response to Form Interrogatory #17.1 Related to Request
for Admission Number 19, subpart (b) was “Albert Gonzalez, Jr. is liable to me
for breach of fiduciary duty.” Once again, Plaintiff does not provide any facts
for why Mr. Gonzalez is not liable.
 
Further,
Request for Admission Number 20 was “Admit that YOU have no facts to support
your claim that Albert Gonzalez, Jr. breached his Fiduciary Duty to YOU.”
Request for Admission Number 21 states “Admit that YOU have not suffered any
damages as a result of Albert Gonzalez, Jr. breaching his fiduciary duty to you
related to ALDA Management, Inc.” Plaintiff denied both of these requests and
answered subpart (b) for both by saying “Albert Gonzalez Jr. issued payments to
unauthorized individuals, issued payments to himself for unknown reasons,
exposed the company to unnecessary risks and engaged in corporate waste.” While
these appear to be facts, Plaintiff did not state which facts indicate that Mr.
Gonzalez breached his fiduciary duty and which facts indicate that Plaintiff
was damaged as a result. More specificity is required for these answers.
 
Defendant also seeks
sanctions in the amount of $1,600.00 against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel
of record for abuse of the discovery process.
 
Defendant filed
his motion on November 8, 2023. Plaintiff filed his opposition on January 19,
2024. Defendant filed his reply on January 22, 2024.
 
RULING: The
motion to compel further responses is granted.
 
Form
Interrogatories
To compel a
further response to interrogatories, the movant can show that: (1) the
responding party’s answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or
incomplete (CCP § 2030.300(a)(1)); (2) the responding party’s exercise of the
option to produce documents in response to an interrogatory was unwarranted or
the required specification of those documents was inadequate (CCP §
2030.300(a)(2)); and (3) the responding party’s objection to an interrogatory
is without merit or too general (CCP § 2030.300(a)(3); see, e.g., Williams
v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 550 (Williams) [defendant’s
argument that plaintiff was required to establish good cause or prove merits of
underlying claim before propounding interrogatories without merit]).
 
In this case,
Plaintiff’s responses to Defendant’s interrogatories are evasive and
incomplete. Rather than providing facts supporting his answer, for each
response Plaintiff simply restates the request for admission that he is
denying. More specificity is also required for answers 20 and 21. Therefore, Plaintiff
is ordered to provide further responses to Form Interrogatory 17.1 as it
relates to Requests for Admission 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 27.
Plaintiff’s responses must include facts that support his denial of the
requests for admission.
 
Sanctions
CCP § 2023.030
authorizes the Court to issue sanctions against a party engaging in conduct
that is a misuse of the discovery process. Failure to respond to discovery,
evasive responses, and objections lacking substantial justification are
“misuses of the discovery process.” (CCP § 2023.010, subd. (d)-(f).)
 
Defendant has
requested sanctions in the amount of $1,660.00 against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s
counsel of record for Plaintiff’s incomplete and evasive discovery responses.
The amount was based on Defendant’s counsel spending 2 hours preparing each of
the motions at $400.00 an hour, plus an anticipated two hours reviewing the opposition,
preparing a reply, and appearing at the hearing, as well as the $60.00 filing
fee. (Zeidman Decl., p. 13:10-20.) This is a reasonable amount for the
sanctions.
 
Defendant’s
request for sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel of record is
granted in the total amount of $1,660.00.
 
ORDER
1.      Defendant’s
motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories is granted.
2.      Plaintiff
is ordered to serve supplemental responses within twenty (20) days.
3.      Plaintiff
and Plaintiff’s counsel of record are ordered to pay sanctions in the total
amount of $1,660.00. Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel of record are ordered to
pay these sanctions to Defendant’s counsel within twenty (20) days.
