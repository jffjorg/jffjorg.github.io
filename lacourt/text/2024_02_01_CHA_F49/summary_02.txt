The defendant argues that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state sufficient facts to support the causes of action. The judge agrees and sustains the demurrer to the third and fifth causes of action with 30 days leave to amend. The judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to plead the requisite specificity required for fraud causes of action and has not pled any facts indicating that the defendant failed to provide sufficient service literature and replacement parts.
