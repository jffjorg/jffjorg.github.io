  CASE NO.: 22STCV18851
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Date: 
  October 10, 2023
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
MOVING PARTY: Joshua I. Epstein (“Epstein”)
 
Epstein
filed a motion to be relieved as Plaintiff’s counsel (the “Motion”).  The Motion is compliant with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  The Motion is unopposed.  Any opposition papers were required to have
been filed and served at least nine court days before the hearing under
California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
DISCUSSION
The
court has discretion on whether to allow an attorney to withdraw, and a motion
to withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would prejudice the
client.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
 
In
support of the Motion, Epstein declares that withdrawal is proper under Rules
of Professional Conduct, rule 1.16  due
to circumstances which involve facts that are required to be kept confidential
under Business and Professions Code section 6068, subdivision (e) and Rules of
Professional Conduct, rule 1.6.  The
Court finds this an adequate basis for withdrawal.   For this reason and because it is unopposed,
the Court GRANTS the Motion.  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)   
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If
the department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar. 
 
           Dated this 10th day of October 2023
