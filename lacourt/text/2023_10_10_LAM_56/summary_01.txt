Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a special motion to strike filed by the plaintiff, Walter Cuevas, against the defendants, Centurion Protection Services and Richard Ray Dudgeon. The defendants had filed a cross-complaint alleging defamation and libel, which the plaintiff claims is protected by the anti-SLAPP statute.

The Judge has granted the motion, finding that the plaintiff has made a prima facie showing that the challenged allegations arise from the defendants' constitutional right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue. The Judge has also found that the plaintiff has established a probability of prevailing on the merits of the action.

The Judge has not assessed the credibility of the evidence and has accepted as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff. The defendants have not presented evidence to show that their claims have minimal merit, and therefore, the motion has been granted. The parties are ordered to submit on this tentative ruling by sending an email to the Court.
