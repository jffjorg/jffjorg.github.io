And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by the defendant, Fadi Edmond Elzayat, D.D.S., against the entire complaint filed by the plaintiff, Julian Lawrence Colberg. The demurrer argues that the complaint lacks factual allegations and is therefore unintelligible. The judge agrees with the defendant that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute any causes of action. As a result, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend. The motion to strike is also moot. The judge finds that the plaintiff failed to respond to the meet and confer request from the defendant's counsel, and therefore the preliminary meet and confer requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 have been satisfied. The judge notes that the burden is on the plaintiff to show that a pleading can be amended successfully, but in this case, there is no reasonable possibility of successful amendment.
