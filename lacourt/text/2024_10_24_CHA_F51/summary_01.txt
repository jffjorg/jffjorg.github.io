And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike two experts from the plaintiff's expert designation. The defendant had argued that the two experts, Azadeh Farin, M.D. and Edwin Haronian, M.D., were duplicative and should be stricken from the case. However, the judge found that the two experts have different specialties and will be offering opinions on different issues and aspects of the plaintiff's injuries. The judge also found that the defendant's motion was premature and that the court did not have sufficient information to determine whether the experts' testimony would be cumulative or overlapping. Therefore, the motion was denied.
