And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling on the demurrer to the second amended complaint is that the demurrer is overruled. The court finds that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to state a claim for fraud, breach of contract, and negligent misrepresentation against defendant Cochran, Inc. The court also finds that the allegations are sufficient to support a claim against Cochran, Inc. under an alter ego theory. The court further finds that the demurrer is without merit and that the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to state a claim for breach of contract.
