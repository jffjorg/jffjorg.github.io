And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The court finds that there are triable issues of material fact regarding each of the claims brought by the plaintiff, Giancarlo Incalza. These claims include allegations of age discrimination, fraudulent inducement, and violations of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA).

The court has determined that the severance agreement signed by Incalza does not bar his claims, as there are disputes about whether the agreement was fraudulently induced and whether the defendants engaged in age-related comments and discrimination. The court has also found that there are triable issues of material fact regarding whether the defendants' employment actions, including the termination of Incalza's employment and the failure to re-hire him, were taken in retaliation for his protected activities.

The court has denied the defendants' request for summary adjudication of Incalza's claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, whistleblower retaliation, and punitive damages. The court finds that there are disputes about whether the defendants' conduct rose to the level of outrageous and whether the defendants engaged in a pattern of conduct consistent with a retaliatory intent.

In conclusion, the court has denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, finding that there are triable issues of material fact regarding each of the claims brought by the plaintiff.
