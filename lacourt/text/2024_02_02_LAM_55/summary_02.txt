And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding that the plaintiff's claims for rescission, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unjust enrichment are viable.

The court found that the plaintiff's consideration for the limited partnership agreement was obtaining resident status under the EB-5 program, and that the defendant's refusal to return the plaintiff's funds is supported by the alleged frustration of purpose and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

The court also found that the plaintiff's allegations support the possibility of restitution for unjust enrichment, even given the existence of the limited partnership agreement, because the plaintiff's claims for rescission and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing are viable.

The court denied the defendant's request to dismiss the individual defendant, Patrick F. Hogan, finding that the plaintiff's allegations adequately support Hogan's liability under the theory of unjust enrichment.

The court will consider the merits of the plaintiff's claims at the hearing on February 2, 2024.
