 Case Number:  22STCV25895    Hearing Date:   February 2, 2024    Dept:  55  
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Defendants’ Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings.
 
The motion is denied.
BACKGROUND
In
this case, Plaintiffs CHEN FANG and YU LIN (“Plaintiffs”) seek rescission and
damages related to a Limited Partnership Agreement (“LPA”) they entered into
with Defendant Group 48 LP. Defendant CMB Export and Defendant NK are general
partners of the Group 48 limited partnership, which is controlled by Defendant
Hogan. The causes of action are: 1) Rescission - Frustration of Purpose; 2)
Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; and 3) Unjust
Enrichment.
Defendants now move for judgment on the pleadings as
to all three claims of the Complaint. Plaintiffs oppose the motion.  
JUDICIAL NOTICE
Defendants seek judicial notice of the LPA, the Private
Placement Memorandum (“PPM”) attached to the Answer, and USCIS notices. (Mot.,
p. 6.)  
Generally, judicial notice of contracts is
improper.  Freemont Indem. Co. v.
Fremont General Corp.  (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 114-15.  When a complainant attaches an entire
contract to a complaint, however, the court may take judicial notice of
it.  Burnett v. Chimney Sweep
(2004) 123 Cal. App. 4th 1057, 1064. The Court therefore takes judicial notice
of the LPA. 
Judicial notice of Internet pages of even official
entities may be improper absent evidentiary foundation showing the following
elements: 1) author, 2) date of creation, 3) purpose, 4) reliability, and 5)
veracity.  Hartwell Corp. v. Sup. Ct. (2002)
27 Cal.4th 256, 279 n. 12.  Content
on official sites on the Internet is not automatically the proper subject of
judicial notice.  Jolley v. Chase Home
Finance, LLC (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 872, 889 (trial court erred in taking
judicial notice of a private contract between a bank and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation). Given such law, Defendants’ requests for judicial
notice are denied as to the PPM contract accompanying the Answer and
declaration, and the USCIS records from the Internet.
LEGAL STANDARD
“The grounds for a motion for judgment on the
pleadings must appear on the face of the complaint or from a matter of which
the court may take judicial notice.” Richardson-Tunnell v. School Ins.
Program for Employees (2007) 157 Cal.App. 4th 1056, 1061,
disapproved on other grounds by Quigley v. Garden Valley Fire Prot. Dist.
(2019) 7 Cal. 5th 798, 815 n.8.  In
considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings, courts consider whether
properly pleaded factual allegations, assumed to be true and liberally
construed, are sufficient to constitute a cause of action.  Stone Street Capital, LLC v. Cal. State
Lottery Com'n (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 109, 116.
“The motion for judgment on the pleadings can be
granted only if the instrument incorporated by reference conclusively negates
the express allegation in the pleading, and except in the extraordinary case,
conclusive negation is unlikely because of the inevitable prospect that parol
evidence may lead to an interpretation of the contract consistent with the
pleading’s express allegation.”  Columbia
Casualty Co. v. Northwestern Nat. Ins. Co. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 457, 470.
ANALYSIS
            MJOP
Is Untimely Reconsideration
“A [statutory] motion for judgment on the pleadings
may be brought on the same grounds as an unsuccessful demurrer only if ‘there
has been a material change in applicable case law or statute since the ruling
on the demurrer.’” Farber v. Bay View Terrace Homeowners Assn. (2006)
141 Cal. App. 4th 1007, 1013 (quoting CCP §438(g)).  Defendants’ motion essentially raises issues
the Court already considered in overruling Defendants’ demurrer and denying
their subsequent motion for reconsideration. 
The Court concludes Defendants’ motion is really an
untimely motion for reconsideration, disguised as a motion for judgment on the
pleadings. Indeed, Defendants admit that the only thing that has changed between
the demurrer and this MJOP (besides the reference to USCIS notices which are
not subject to judicial notice) is the judge handling the case. While the Court
will consider the merits of the MJOP, it expects counsel for Defendants to follow
all applicable rules and proceed in this litigation in an efficient manner.
Rescission - Frustration
of Purpose
Plaintiffs’ first cause of action seeks rescission under
Civil Code Section 1689(b) because the value of Plaintiffs’ consideration
(obtaining resident status under the EB-5 program) is void. Defendants assert
that rescission is not an independent cause of action but instead a remedy as
to which Plaintiffs must allege a viable claim for breach of contract. (Mot.,
9:6 et seq.).  
In ruling upon demurrers, courts consider whether any
cause of action has been alleged sufficiently, notwithstanding that a cause of
action is labeled otherwise.  Arce ex
rel. Arce v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471,
482. 
 “[T]he allegations in the
body of the complaint, not the caption, constitute the cause of action against
the defendant.”  Davaloo v. State Farm
Ins. Co. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 409, 418.
Statutory elements of a claim for rescission are set forth in Civil Code Section 1689. Wong v. Stoler
(2015) 237 Cal. App. 4th 1375, 1385 (“Both the grounds for rescission and the
means by which parties may rescind their contract are governed by statute.”) A
claim for rescission based on lack of consideration under Section 1689 can be an
independent cause of action without including a breach of contract claim. Crocker-Anglo
Nat. Bank v. Kuchman (1964) 224 Cal.App.2d 490, 496 (“they have a cause of action for
rescission under subsection (b)(1) of section 1689 of the Civil Code.”).  
The LPA’s terms addressing the specific circumstances
under which a limited partner’s capital contribution may be returned, and
breach, are not determinative issues, because rescission can still apply based
on the alleged failure of consideration (e.g., Plaintiffs’ gaining permanent
residency through the EB-5 program). See, e.g., Wildlife, Inc. v.
City of Rancho Cucamonga (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1306, 1332 (“‘[i]f the consideration for the obligation of
the rescinding party, before it is rendered to him, fails in a material respect
from any cause’ a party may rescind a contract.”).  “‘[F]ailure of consideration is the failure
to execute a promise, the performance of which has been exchanged for
performance by the other party.’"   FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 398. 
Hence, the issue of whether the LPA guaranteed Plaintiffs’
return of consideration is immaterial to the analysis that instead rests on
failure of consideration.  Defendants’
own citations indicate that only contract provisions are evaluated in
ascertaining whether an investment return was guaranteed in violation of
immigration law. (See Mot., 2:16-3:7). 
Even if resulting, extrinsic factors apply, USCIS’ approval of Fang’s
I-526 Petition was not a guaranteed result, in light of the agency’s
discretion, and so Plaintiffs’ application did not directly cause any failure
of consideration, but instead an intervening agency determination did. It was
possible that Plaintiffs’ application would be denied, thereby leaving intact
the alleged consideration. Similarly, Plaintiffs’ seeking rescission still
leaves open uncertainty about the investment, because there is no guarantee
that this litigation will be resolved via a judgment of rescission.  Hence, even the extrinsic factors have not
negated the existence of alleged consideration.
Thus, Plaintiff failure of consideration is
sufficiently alleged in the body of the cause of action, and the Court need not
also address the additional theory of frustration of purpose. Demurrers
do not lie as to only parts of causes of action, where some valid claim
is alleged.  Poizner v. Fremont
General Corp.  (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119 (“A demurrer
must dispose of an entire cause of action to be sustained.”).
            Breach
of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
Defendants contend that the implied covenant cannot be
used “to override an express provision of the contract,” quoting Gerdlund v.
Elec. Dispensers Int’l (1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 263, 277.  (Mot., 10:14-11:15.)  
The elements of the claim for Breach of Implied
Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing are: 

Existence
     of contractual relationship;
implied
     duty
breach;  and
causation
     of damages.

Smith v. San Francisco
(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 38, 49. 
The Complaint does not reveal that refusal to return Plaintiffs’
funds is expressly allowed by the LPA, because it is actually silent as to the
type of basis for investment return alleged here. (Complaint, ¶ 23 (“The
purpose of the LPA is frustrated, because of a supervening, fortuitous event
that, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services has granted
Plaintiffs their current status….”)).  See
generally  Brehm v. 21st Century
Ins. Co. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1241 
(“The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing cannot prohibit a
contracting party from doing that which is expressly permitted by the
agreement.”);  Storek & Storek,
Inc. v. Citicorp Real Estate, Inc. (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 44, 55 (“[E]very
contract imposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in the
performance of the contract such that neither party shall do anything which
will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to
receive the fruits of the contract.”);  
Judicial notice of immigration records would fail to
address alleged failures of conditional permanent residency, as
distinguished from granted EB-5 applications for visas. (Complaint, ¶ 15
(Defendants denied Plaintiffs’ request in June and July 2022, that Defendants
want to see a “denial of [Plaintiffs’] conditional residency….”)).  EB-5 Visas can also involve residency.  “[P]laintiffs, as conditional permanent
residents, had been lawfully admitted as permanent residents for the purposes
of qualifying for naturalization….”  2
Immigration Law Service 2d § 8:94.  
The Court therefore denies the motion for judgment on
the pleadings as to the breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing
claim.
            Unjust
Enrichment
Defendants contend that all three claims fail because Plaintiffs
received the full consideration bargained for pursuant to the LPA’s provisions.
(Mot., 6:22 et seq.).  Additionally, Defendants
argue that common counts cannot be a substitute for express contracts. (Mot.,
7:4 et seq.).  
Even partial failures of consideration may be
cognizable.  See  Bonadelle Const. Co. v. Hernandez
(1959) 169 Cal. App. 2d 396, 399  (“A
partial failure of consideration ….”).  
“‘Consideration consists of either a benefit to the promisor or a
detriment to the promisee. It is enough that something is promised, done,
forborne, or suffered by the party to whom the promise is made as consideration
for the promise made to him.’” Speirs v. BlueFire Ethanol Fuels, Inc.
(2015) 243 Cal. App. 4th 969, 987.  
As a matter of procedure, “a common count, by long
continued practice is not subject to attack by general demurrer or by a special
demurrer for uncertainty.”  Auckland
v. Conlin (1928) 203 Cal. 776, 778. “When a common count is used as an
alternative way of seeking the same recovery demanded in a specific cause of
action, and is based on the same facts, the common count is demurrable if the
cause of action is demurrable."  Berryman
v. Merit Property Management, Inc. 
(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1560.
A common count is proper notwithstanding that it
relates to an original transaction involving an express or implied
contract.  Utility Audit Co. v. City
of L. A. (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 950, 958. 

Moreover, contractual relationships are not required
for unjust enrichment, which has the elements:

Receipt
     of a benefit;  
unjust
     or wrongful retention of the benefit; 
     and
at
     the expense of another.

Peterson v. Cellco Partnership
(2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1583, 1593;  Lectrodryer
v. SeoulBank (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 723, 726.
Restitution is a synonym for unjust enrichment, which
is not a cognizable theory, but instead a general principal related to other
claims and remedies.  Melchior v. New
Line Productions, Inc. (2003) 106 Cal. App. 4th 779, 794.  “‘[T]here is no particular form of pleading
necessary to invoke the doctrine’ of restitution.”  Dinosaur Dev. v. White (1989) 216 Cal.
App. 3d 1310, 1315.  “The person
receiving the benefit is required to make restitution only if the circumstances
are such that, as between the two individuals, it is unjust for the person to
retain it.”  First Nationwide Savings
v. Perry (1992) 11 Cal. App. 4th 1657, 1663.
 
Assuming, arguendo, that residence were not
guaranteed, even a partial failure of consideration can be actionable, which
here would be performing some efforts towards residency, even if the efforts
ultimately fail.  Further, the instant
contracts reasonably can be interpreted to include some amount of consideration
regarding residency.  Courts defer to
plaintiffs’ reasonable interpretations of contracts, in ruling upon demurrers.  Performance Plastering v. Richmond
American Homes of Cal., Inc.  (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 659, 672 (lack of
essential terms in agreement not properly resolved on demurrer where related to
complainants’ reasonable interpretations); 
Aragon-Haas v. Family Security Services, Inc. (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 232, 239;  Davies v. Sallie
Mae, Inc. (2008) 168 Cal. App. 4th 1086, 1091.  
Further, Plaintiffs’ allegations support the
possibility of restitution for unjust enrichment, even given the existence of
the LPA, because they allegedly should be rescinded.  E.g., McBride v. Boughton
(2004) 123 Cal. App. 4th 379, 388 (“restitution may be awarded in lieu of
breach of contract damages when the parties had an express contract, but it …
is unenforceable or ineffective for some reason.”).   
Unjust enrichment is a viably alleged Cause of Action,
as analyzed above.
 
            Individual
Defendant’s Liability
Defendants contend that Defendant Patrick F. Hogan
(“Hogan”) is not a party to the contract, and the Complaint does not allege
that Hogan did anything wrong. (Mot., 2:2-4.)
Unjust Enrichment claims do not require contracting
parties. See Federal Deposit
Ins. Corp. v. Dintino (2008)
167 Cal.App.4th 333, 346 (“a cause of action for unjust enrichment is not based
on … a written contract.”). The Complaint, via global allegations, alleges
and infers that the individual Defendant did in fact do something wrong--  i.e., retain monies and was unjustly enriched.
 (Complaint, ¶ 41 (“Defendants benefited
at the expense of Plaintiffs….”)).  
While the claims do not state which defendants are
being sued for Rescission and Breach of the Implied Covenant, the Court need
not reach the ambiguity of the other claims, where Defendants did not raise
that issue, and unjust enrichment is sufficiently alleged as to all
defendants.  See generally, e.g.,  Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal. App. 3d 135, 139  (The
failure to identify claims and parties by labeling causes of action, may render
a complaint uncertain, except where the complaint contains allegations
sufficiently apprising defendants of the issues, in which case a demurrer
should be overruled.)
The individual defendant is adequately alleged to be
liable at least under the viable theory of unjust enrichment.  As such, it would be error to dismiss that
defendant as requested.
