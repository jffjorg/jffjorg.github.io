The plaintiff seeks to compel the defendant to serve responses to discovery requests and to deem admitted requests for admissions. The judge has granted the motion with respect to the form and special interrogatories and document requests, but has allowed extra time for the defendant to serve responses due to defense counsel's medical challenges. The judge has also denied the request for monetary sanctions due to the existence of substantial justification regarding defense counsel's medical challenges. The defendant is ordered to serve initial responses and produce documents without objections and in full compliance with the California Discovery Act by March 26, 2024.
