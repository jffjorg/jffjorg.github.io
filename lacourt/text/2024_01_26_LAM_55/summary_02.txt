And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the unopposed motion filed by Plaintiff John Oursland to deem admitted requests for admission and to award monetary sanctions against Defendant Joe Sherman. The motion was filed because Defendant failed to respond to requests for admission served on October 5, 2023, which were due by November 9, 2023. The Court finds that the absence of substantial justification warrants the award of discovery sanctions in the amount of $3,060.00. The Court deems admitted the genuineness of documents and the truth of matters specified in the requests for admission. Defendant Joe Sherman is ordered to pay the sanctions to Plaintiff John Oursland on or before February 26, 2024.
