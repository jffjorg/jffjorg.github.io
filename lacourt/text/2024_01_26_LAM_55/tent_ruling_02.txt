 Case Number:  23STCV20476    Hearing Date:   January 26, 2024    Dept:  55  
NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Plaintiff John
Oursland’s Motion To Deem Requests For Admission, Set One As Admitted;
Request For Order Awarding Monetary Sanctions In The Amount Of $3,060.00 Against
Defendant Joe Sherman.
Plaintiff has filed a motion for an order to deem
admitted requests for admission, and to obtain monetary sanctions in the amount
of $3,060.00 against Defendant, because: On 10/5/23, Plaintiff served requests
for admission on Defendant, seeking relevant admissions concerning the
pleadings (Gerber Decl. ¶2 and ex. A).  Responses to the discovery requests were due by
11/9/23 (CCP § 2033.250(a) (30 days after service, extended for service by mail
under C.C.P. §1013)). However, Defendant did not provide responses to the
Requests for Admission (Gerber Decl. ¶¶ 3-4).
Plaintiff’s motion sufficiently shows that Defendant
failed to respond timely to requests for admission, and there is no indication
Defendant served responses between the time Plaintiff filed the motion and the
hearing. Furthermore, the motion is unopposed. 
The unopposed motion is granted.
The Court deems admitted the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the subject requests for
admissions.
On or before 2/26/24, Defendant JOE SHERMAN shall pay
discovery sanctions in the requested sum of $3,060.00 to Plaintiff JOHN
OURSLAND, the Court finding the absence of substantial justification.    E.g., CCP   § 2023.030.
