And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Starbucks. The judge has determined that Starbucks had a duty to not issue a customer restriction notice on plaintiff without due diligence or care, and without stating the true facts. The judge has also determined that plaintiff has alleged that Starbucks violated this duty by issuing a false customer restriction notice while knowing that the statements were false. The judge has concluded that these allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action.

The judge has also ruled that the demurrer contains extrinsic facts which are not allowed, and is considering assessing monetary sanctions for the violation of this rule. Finally, the judge has overruled the demurrer and ordered Starbucks to answer the complaint within 20 days.
