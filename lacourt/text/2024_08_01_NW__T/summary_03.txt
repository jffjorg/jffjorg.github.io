```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to quash in part, allowing the production of certain personnel records from Sephora. The court finds that despite the waiver of privacy, the production of records must be limited to those that are reasonably related to the case. The court allows the production of records from September 2020 to the present, which may be relevant to the subject matter of the case or lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Any records prior to September 2020 are considered overbroad and protected by privacy. The court will allow the production of certain records on a "first look" basis, and if plaintiff's counsel finds records that they contend should not be produced, they must send the records not in dispute to the defendant and seek an IDC with the court to discuss the records withheld.
