And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Dominick Simons' motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One and Request for Production of Documents, Set One against Defendant Canales Transportation, LLC. The Judge finds that the Defendant's responses were evasive and incomplete, and that the Defendant's arguments are insufficient to deny the motion. The Judge orders the Defendant to serve verified Code Compliant responses and produce documents within 20 days. The Judge notes that the Defendant seems to be asserting that it had no insurance coverage at all, and if this is the case, the Defendant should respond "No" to the Form Interrogatories and not produce documents in response to the Request for Production of Documents.
