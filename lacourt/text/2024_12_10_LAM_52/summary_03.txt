And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants defendant Mercedes-Benz, LLC's motions for relief from waiver of objections to plaintiff Lusine Boyajyan's discovery requests and to withdraw admissions deemed true upon plaintiff's motion. The defendant failed to serve timely responses to the discovery requests, but later served responses in July 2024, which were found to be in substantial compliance with the statutes governing discovery. The defendant's counsel relied on an associate attorney who made mistakes, and the defendant's failure to serve timely responses was deemed excusable. The judge also grants the defendant's motion to withdraw its admissions, as the admissions resulted from mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect and will not substantially prejudice the plaintiff. The judge finds that denying these motions would prejudice the defendant in a way that does not serve the interests of justice.
