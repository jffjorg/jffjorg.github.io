 Case Number:  24STCV07334    Hearing Date:   December 10, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendant
Lyft, Inc.’s Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Action 
Defendant
Lyft, Inc. (Lyft) moves to compel arbitration of plaintiff Saul Garcia’s claims
against it.  Lyft further moves to stay
this action against it.
Both the California Arbitration Act and Federal
Arbitration Act permit a party to petition to enforce an agreement to arbitrate
disputes.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2; 9.
U.S.C. § 2.)  A motion to compel
arbitration is “a summary proceeding.”  (Espejo v. Southern California Permanente
Medical Group (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1047, 1057.)  The moving party can meet the “initial burden
to show an agreement to arbitrate by attaching a copy of the arbitration
agreement purportedly bearing the opposing party’s signature.”  (Id. at p. 1060.)  
Lyft meets
its burden.  It presents evidence that plaintiff
agreed to Lyft’s terms of service in its mobile app.  (McCachern Decl., ¶¶ 3-16.)  The terms of service require arbitrating
disputes with Lyft.  (Id., Ex. 8, pp.
1, 22-31.)   
Plaintiff gives
no basis for the court to deny this motion. 
The law favors enforcement of valid arbitration
agreements.  (Armendariz
v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83,
97.)  “ ‘ “[A] party opposing the petition bears the
burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence any fact necessary to
its defense.” ’ ”  (Kader v. Southern
California Medical Center, Inc. (2024) 99 Cal.App.5th 214, 221.)  Plaintiff does not meet his burden.
Disposition
            Defendant Lyft, Inc.’s motion to
compel arbitration and stay the action against it is granted.  The court hereby orders plaintiff Saul
Garcia to arbitrate his causes of action against defendant Lyft, Inc. in
compliance with Lyft, Inc.’s terms of service. 
The court hereby stays the action as against defendant Lyft, Inc.
