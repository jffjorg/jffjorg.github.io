 Case Number:  23STCV08824    Hearing Date:   December 10, 2024    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Entry of Default
Judgment
Plaintiff Vernel Trainor filed a complaint alleging
a single cause of action for breach of contract against defendants Los Angeles
Hostel, LLC, Dmitry
Shabliuk, Jamoliddin Yuldashev, and Does 1-100. 
The clerk has entered the defaults of each named defendant.  Plaintiff later dismissed defendants Shabliuk
and Yuldashev.  
Plaintiff’s
request for default judgment is defective for four reasons.
First,
plaintiff did not use the mandatory Judicial Council of California form CIV-100
to request default judgment via court judgment or clerk’s judgment.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).)
Second,
plaintiff did not submit “[a] proposed form of judgment.”  (Rule 3.1800(a)(6).)  The court directs plaintiff to submit a
proposed judgment on form JUD-100.
Third,
plaintiff did not request dismissal of Does 1-100 or apply for a separate
judgment only against Los Angeles Hostel, LLC. 
(Rule 3.1800(a)(7).)
Fourth, plaintiff seeks damages exceeding the
amount demanded in the complaint.  “A
default judgment greater than the amount specifically demanded in the complaint
is void as beyond the court’s jurisdiction.” 
(Airs Aromatics, LLC v. CBL Data Recovery Technologies, Inc.
(2018) 23 Cal.App.5th 1013, 1018 (Airs Aromatics).)  “Courts have applied this principle even to
those prayers for relief requesting damages ‘ “in excess” ’ of a specific
amount.”  (Behm v. Clear View
Technologies (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 1, 13.) 
In a default judgment, the plaintiff may only recover the amount
specified as the minimum damages.  (Id.
at pp. 13, 17; Electronic Funds Solutions, LLC v. Murphy (2005) 134
Cal.App.4th 1161, 1167.)
Plaintiff’s
complaint prays “[f]or compensatory damages in a principal sum not less than
$12,000 as of the date of filing this complaint.”  (Comp., p. 5.)  Plaintiff alleges defendants failed to make
six payments of $2,000 each.  (Id.,
¶ 14.)  Now, plaintiff requests a
judgment of $39,000 in principal owed, plus interest.  (Peterson Decl. Re Judgment by Clerk, ¶¶
13-15.)  That exceeds the $12,000 specifically
demanded in the complaint.
To recover more than $12,000 in damages, plaintiff
must amend the complaint to specifically demand the amount of damages sought.  Doing so would vacate defendants’
defaults.  After a plaintiff “file[s] an
amended complaint praying for a different amount of damages and/or other
appropriate relief… she must serve her amended complaint on defendants, who
will be entitled to file a new answer; all issues will then be at large,
including liability.”  (Greenup v.
Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 830; accord Airs Aromatics, supra,
23 Cal.App.5th at p. 1025 [filing amended complaint vacates default].)  The amended complaint must be served in the
manner of a summons.  (Engebretson & Co. v. Harrison (1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 436,
444.)
Disposition
The court hereby continues the order
to show cause re: entry of default judgment to February 6, 2025, at 8:30 a.m.  Under Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (a)(1), the court hereby grants plaintiff leave to file a first
amended complaint to specifically demand a greater amount of damages.
