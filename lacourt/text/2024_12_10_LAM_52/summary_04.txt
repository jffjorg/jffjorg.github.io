And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

In this case, Lyft, Inc. is moving to compel arbitration of plaintiff Saul Garcia's claims against it and to stay the action. Lyft has presented evidence that Garcia agreed to Lyft's terms of service in its mobile app, which requires arbitrating disputes with Lyft. Garcia has not presented any basis to deny this motion, and the law favors enforcement of valid arbitration agreements. Therefore, the court grants Lyft's motion to compel arbitration and stay the action against it, ordering Garcia to arbitrate his causes of action against Lyft in compliance with Lyft's terms of service.
