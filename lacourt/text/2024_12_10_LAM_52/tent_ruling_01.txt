  Case Number:  22STCV36102    Hearing Date:   December 10, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendant’s
Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Independent Mental Examination
Defendant
Regents of the University of California moves to compel an independent mental
examination (IME) of plaintiff Arthur Little under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2032.320.  
Plaintiff
opposes this motion on the basis that defendant moved for this order after the
discovery cutoff.  Defendant contends the
motion is timely because an IME constitutes expert discovery, and the parties
agreed to continue the expert discovery deadline.  The parties stipulated to extend the deadline
to complete “expert discovery.”  (Memo,
p. 10; Bravo-Karimi Decl., ¶ 16, Ex. I.) 
Specifically, plaintiff’s counsel asked if defendant would agree “to
continuing our expert discovery deadlines in accordance with our November 13th
trial date?”  (Id, Ex. I, p.
2.)  Defendant’s counsel agreed.  (Id., p. 1.)    
That
agreement does not apply to an IME.  The
Civil Discovery Act provides two sets of discovery deadlines.  First, Code of Civil Procedure section
2024.020 governs discovery proceedings in general.  Second, section 2024.030 concerns “discovery
proceedings pertaining to a witness identified under Chapter 18 (commencing
with Section 2034.010).”  That Chapter
concerns expert witnesses.  Every single section
in Chapter 18 includes the word “expert” or the phrase “expert witness.”  
In
contrast, the provisions on IMEs are in Chapter 15 of the Civil Discovery Act.  The sections on IMEs (Chapter 15, Article 3) only
use the term “expert” in section 2032.320, subdivision (c)(2), which provides
that courts generally may not order a mental examination when the plaintiff
“stipulate[es] that no expert testimony regarding this usual mental and
emotional distress will be presented at trial in support of the claim for
damages.”  Chapter 15 also includes
provisions governing exchanging reports about the examination.  (§§ 2032.610-2032.650.)  Those provisions do not incorporate Chapter
18’s sections about exchanging expert witness information.
Defendant
relies on three unpublished United States District Court cases—all of which
interpret the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, not the Civil Discovery
Act.  (Narayan v. Compass Grp. USA,
Inc. (E.D. Cal. Jan. 18, 2019) No. 17-0999, 2019 WL 265109, at *3; Rowland
v. Paris Las Vegas (S.D. Cal. Aug. 6, 2015) No. 13-2630, 2015 WL 4662032,
at *4; Lopez v. City of Imperial (S.D. Cal. Jan. 21, 2014) No. 13-0597–
BEN-WVG, 2014 WL 232271, at *3.)  Unlike
the Civil Discovery Act, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure include at least
one provision referring to the IME procedure as “expert” discovery.  (Fed. Rules Civ.Proc., rule 26(b)(4)(D)(i)
[using term “expert” in reference to rule 35(B), which governs IME reports].)
The
parties’ stipulation to continue “expert discovery deadlines” does not apply to
this motion to compel IME.  The motion is
untimely.  The court therefore cannot
grant it without first reopening discovery. 
(Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008)
165 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1588.)    
Disposition
            Defendant Regents of the University
of California’s motion to compel plaintiff’s independent mental examination is denied.  The parties are ordered to meet and
confer within 14 days regarding reopening discovery to conduct an independent
mental examination.
