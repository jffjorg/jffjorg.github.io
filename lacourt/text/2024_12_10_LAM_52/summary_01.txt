And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge denies the Defendant's motion to compel the Plaintiff's independent mental examination (IME). The Defendant argued that the motion is timely because an IME constitutes expert discovery, and the parties agreed to continue the expert discovery deadline. However, the Judge finds that the parties' stipulation to continue expert discovery deadlines does not apply to IME, which is governed by Chapter 15 of the Civil Discovery Act. The Judge also rejects the Defendant's reliance on unpublished federal court cases, which interpret the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, not the Civil Discovery Act. The Judge concludes that the motion is untimely and orders the parties to meet and confer regarding reopening discovery to conduct an IME.
