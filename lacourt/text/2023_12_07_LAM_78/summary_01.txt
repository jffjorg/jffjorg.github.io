And here is a summary in English text:

The Court's tentative ruling grants Defendant Levin's motions to compel Plaintiff's further responses to written discovery, including Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Requests for Production, and Requests for Admissions. The Court finds that Plaintiff's responses were incomplete, evasive, or without merit.

The Court specifically grants the motion to compel Plaintiff's further responses to:

* Form Interrogatories, except for FROG 17, which is denied
* Special Interrogatories, except for SROGs 15 and 16, which are denied
* Requests for Production, except for RPDs 4, 5, 15, 16, and 19, which are denied
* Requests for Admissions, except for RFAs 5-7, which are denied

The Court awards sanctions in the amount of $2,650 against Plaintiff for his failure to comply with discovery requests.

The Court's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and Evidence Code, and the Court finds that Plaintiff's responses were not adequate and did not comply with discovery requests. The Court also finds that Plaintiff's objections to discovery requests were without merit.
