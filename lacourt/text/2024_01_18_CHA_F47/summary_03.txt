And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by Alal, LLC dba Kei-Ai Los Angeles Healthcare Center to the 4th and 5th causes of action in the cross-complaint filed by Jim Rey and Blenda Rey is sustained. The Reys have 30 days to amend their pleading to cure the defects. The judge found that the Reys failed to allege sufficient facts to satisfy the third and fifth elements of the claim, specifically that Kei-Ai failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent the alleged harassment, discrimination, and retaliation, and that Kei-Ai's alleged failure to take reasonable steps was a substantial factor in causing the Reys' alleged harm. Additionally, the judge found that the alleged conduct in the 5th cause of action, which relates to intentional infliction of emotional distress, does not constitute extreme and outrageous conduct.
