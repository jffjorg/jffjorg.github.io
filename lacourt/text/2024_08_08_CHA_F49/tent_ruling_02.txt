(“Craftscape”) (collectively, “Defendants/Cross-Complainants”) and Does 1

Misrepresentation (against Defendants and Does 1-10), (2) Breach of Written
Contract (against Defendants/Cross-Complainants and Does 11-20), (3) Breach of
Oral Contract (against Defendants/Cross-Complainants and Does 21-30), (4)
Unjust Enrichment (against Defendants and Does 21-40), (5) Conversion (against

16, 2024.
 
On January 17, 2024, Defendants/Cross-Complainants filed
their Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant, alleging equitable
indemnity and contribution.
 
On May 10, 2024, Counsel filed the instant Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel (the “Motion”).
 
            No Opposition papers have been
received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
The
court may order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before
or after judgment or final determination upon request by either client or
attorney and after notice from one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc. § 284, subd. (2).)
“The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel
lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.) An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council
Forms MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).)
 
            In addition, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362,
subsection (d) requires that the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and
proposed order be served on the client and all other parties who have appeared
in the case by personal service, electronic service, or mail. If the notice is
served by mail, it must be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing
that either:
 
            (A) The service address is the current residence or
business address of the client; or
(B)
The service address is the last known residence or business address of the
client and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after
making reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the
motion to be relieved.
 
            (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(1)(A) & (2).)
 
Here, Counsel has filed Judicial Council Forms MC-051 and
MC-052. Counsel has also lodged Judicial Council Form MC-053 with the Court. 
 
Counsel
has provided a declaration stating that the Motion is necessitated by “a
breakdown in communication” and that “the attorney-client relationship is
irreparably broken.” (MC-025, ¶ 2.) The Court finds Counsel’s reasons for
seeking relief to be satisfactory. 
 
Counsel states in the declaration that the Motion was
served by mail, return receipt requested, at Calvin Alexander Kim’s last known
address, for which Counsel was unable to confirm as the current address. (MC-052,
¶ 3b(2)(a).) Proof of Service has been attached to the Motion papers,
demonstrating proper service on Calvin Alexander Kim and all other parties who
have appeared in the case.
 
Counsel indicates on the MC-052 and MC-053 forms that the
next hearing scheduled for this action is a Case Management Conference set for May
28, 2024, at 8:30 AM, in Department F51 Chatsworth Courthouse, CA 91311. (MC-052,
¶ 4.) A jury trial is not yet set. (Id. ¶ 6.)) Since this date has
passed, the information needs to be updated to reflect the future hearing dates
and places. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel, subject to the condition that Counsel submits an updated
MC-053 form, reflecting all future hearing dates and places, within 5 days of
this order.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Non-party Calvin Alexander Kim’s
Counsel Chi Leung Ip and Law Offices of Edward C. Ip
& Associates’ Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED, subject
to the condition that Counsel submits an updated
MC-053 form, reflecting all future hearing dates and places, within 5 days of
this order.

ANALYSIS
The court may
order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or after
judgment or final determination upon request by either client or attorney and
after notice from one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc. § 284, subd. (2).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.) An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council
Forms MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).)
            In
addition, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subsection (d) requires that
the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order be served on
the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case by personal
service, electronic service, or mail. If the notice is served by mail, it must
be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing that either:
            (A) The service address is the current residence or
business address of the client; or
(B)
The service address is the last known residence or business address of the
client and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after
making reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the
motion to be relieved.
 
            (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(1)(A) & (2).)
 
Here, Counsel has filed Judicial Council Forms MC-051 and
MC-052. Counsel has also lodged Judicial Council Form MC-053 with the Court. 
 
Counsel
has provided a declaration stating that the Motion is necessitated by the
reason that “Mr. Allen Abraham, Chief Executive Officer of CRAFTSCAPE
CREATIONS LLC, has failed to abide by the obligations contained in my
employment contract for attorney services on behalf of Craftscape Creations, LLC. By not
doing so, my representation of Craftscape Creations, LLC is no longer
sustainable. Craftscape Creations, LLC simply cannot afford to make payments
towards my fees; therefore, my office and myself cannot continue working for free as it is causing a hardship on my firm.” (MC-025, ¶ 2.) 
 
The Court finds Counsel’s reasons for seeking relief to be satisfactory.
Counsel states in his declaration that the Motion was served by mail at Craftscape’s
last known address. (MC-052, ¶ 3(a)(2).) Additionally, Counsel has confirmed “by
conversation” that this address is current. (Ibid.) Proof of Service has
been attached to the Motion papers, demonstrating proper service on Craftscape
and all other parties who have appeared in the case.
 
Counsel indicates on the MC-052 and MC-053 forms that the
next hearing scheduled for this action is a Case Management Conference set for May
28, 2024, in Department F51 at 9425 Penfield Ave., Chatsworth, CA 91311. (MC-052,
¶ 4.) A jury trial is not yet set. (Id. ¶ 6.)) Since this date has
passed, the information needs to be updated to reflect the future hearing dates
and places. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel, subject to the condition that Counsel submits an updated
MC-053 form, reflecting all future hearing dates and places, within 5 days of
this order.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant Craftscape Creations, LLC’s Counsel Jilbert Tahmazian’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel
is GRANTED, subject to the condition that Counsel submits
an updated MC-053 form, reflecting all future hearing dates and places, within
5 days of this order.
