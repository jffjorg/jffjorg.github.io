And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motions to be relieved as counsel filed by counsel Chi Leung Ip and counsel Jilbert Tahmazian. In each case, the motion is granted subject to the condition that counsel submits an updated MC-053 form reflecting all future hearing dates and places within 5 days of this order.

The motion filed by counsel Chi Leung Ip is necessitated by a breakdown in communication with the client, Calvin Alexander Kim, and the attorney-client relationship is irreparably broken. The court finds this reason satisfactory and grants the motion.

The motion filed by counsel Jilbert Tahmazian is necessitated by the reason that the client, Craftscape Creations, LLC, has failed to abide by the obligations contained in the employment contract for attorney services. The court finds this reason satisfactory and grants the motion.

In both cases, the court notes that the motions are properly filed and served, and that the declarations of counsel provide sufficient grounds for relief. The court also notes that the motions are unopposed and that the parties have not raised any objections.
