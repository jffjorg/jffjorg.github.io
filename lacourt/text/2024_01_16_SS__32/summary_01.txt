And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition for minors compromise filed by Nora Meza. The petition was unopposed, and the Judge's decision was based on several reasons. The Court requires a declaration from the guardian ad litem to ensure that the minor, Starr Olazaba, is fully recovered from her injuries. The petition also lacked necessary information, including the effect of the proposed compromise on the petitioner's claim and the reasons for apportionment. Additionally, the Court found contradictory information in the petition, including the failure to include fees expected to be received by the attorney. The moving party is ordered to give notice.
