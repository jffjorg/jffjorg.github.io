And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has sustained the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's third amended complaint, citing that the plaintiff has failed to allege facts sufficient to support the causes of action under Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1. The judge has granted the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint to cure the defects. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for judicial notice as to Exhibit B and granted the defendant's request for judicial notice as to Exhibit A. The judge declined to address the parties' arguments on the constitutionality of AB 218, citing that it is not relevant to the demurrer stage.
