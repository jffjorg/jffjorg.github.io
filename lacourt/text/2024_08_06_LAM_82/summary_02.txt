Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Julia Sylva's special motion to dismiss under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, commonly known as an "Anti-SLAPP motion." The court finds that Sylva's communications were protected by the anti-SLAPP statute, and that Petitioner has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its claims against Sylva. The court also orders Petitioner's counsel to file a notice informing the court whether his client intends to pursue the claim in federal court or state court on or before a certain date. The hearing on Respondents' demurrer is continued to a future date.
