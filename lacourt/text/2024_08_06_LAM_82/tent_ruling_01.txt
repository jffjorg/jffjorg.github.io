Order #1 of 2
Applications for
Writs of Attachment
 
INTRODUCTION
 
Plaintiff Prime Electric
Wholesale, Corp. (“Plaintiff”) moves for additional writs of attachment against
Defendants Ara Petrosyan and LA Solar Group, Inc. (“Defendants”) in the amounts
of $470,432.70 and $411,248.97, respectively. 
The applications are granted in part and denied in part.  
 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
            On April 3, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a complaint against LA Solar Group, Inc. (“LA Solar”) and Ara Petrosyan
(“Petrosyan”) (collectively, “Defendants”), along with two insurance companies.  Plaintiff asserts the following causes of
action against Defendants:
 
            1.         Breach
of Contact against LA Solar 
            2.         Quantum
Meruit against LA Solar
            3.         Account
Stated against LA Solar 
            4.         Open
Book Account against LA Solar
            5.         Breach
of Personal Guaranty against Petrosyan
 
(See
Complaint, dated March 31, 2023.)  Previously,
Plaintiff sought writs of attachment. 
The court (Beckloff, J.) granted the applications and issued the writs
of attachment as follows: (1) A writ in the amount of $266,988.44 against LA
Solar, and (2) A writ in the amount of $317,820.23 against Petrosyan.  The parties stipulated to release real
property owned by Petrosyan so he could sell it, and the proceeds went to
Plaintiff.  The parties confirmed
that Plaintiff received $265,391.94 from the sale, leaving $52,428.29 on the
writ of attachment against Petrosyan.  
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
“Upon the filing of the
complaint or at any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply pursuant to this
article for a right to attach order and a writ of attachment by filing an
application for the order and writ with the court in which the action is
brought.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 484.010.)
 
The court shall issue a right to attach
order if the court finds all
of the following: 
 
(1)   The claim upon which the attachment is
based is one upon which an attachment may be issued. 
 
(2)   The plaintiff has established the
probable validity of the claim upon which the attachment is based.
 
(3)   The attachment is not sought for a
purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is
based. 
 
(4)   The amount to be secured by the
attachment is greater than zero.  
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 484.090.)  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is more likely than
not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant on that
claim.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 481.190.)  “In
contested applications, the court must consider the relative merits of the
positions of the respective parties and make a determination of¿the probable
outcome of the litigation.”¿  (Hobbs v.
Weiss (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 76, 80.)  “The
application shall be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on
the facts presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.”¿(Code Civ. Proc. § 484.030.)  “The facts stated in each affidavit
filed [in support of the application] shall be set forth with particularity.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 482.040.) 
 
DISCUSSION

 
            Plaintiff seeks to increase the
writs of attachment against Defendant to include: (a) The principal amount owed
for the custom items; (b) The full value of the non-custom items; (c)
Additional interest accrued; and (d) Additional attorney’s fees incurred since issuance
of the prior writs.  The court will
address each issue separately.
 
            A.        Custom
Items 
 
            The court denies the applications to
the extent they seek to include amounts for custom items.  To apply for a writ of attachment, the
plaintiff must first file a complaint that includes a contract claim.  (See Code Civ. Proc. § 484.010.)  After the complaint is filed, “an attachment
may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which
is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the
claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five
hundred dollars ($500) exclusive of costs, interest, and attorney's fees.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 483.010(a).)  
 
This
statutory scheme shows that the application must be based on a contract claim
pleaded in the complaint.  A different
interpretation would raise due process issues that the legislature sought to
address when drafting the pre-judgment attachment statutes.  (See Royals v. Lu (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th
328, 345.)  Moreover, because
pre-judgment attachment is a harsh remedy, the statute is strictly
construed.  (See id. at
344-345.)  
 
            The complaint makes clear that the
breach of contract claim is not predicated on the custom items.  The complaint seeks the sum of $327,496.14 based
upon an invoice attached to the complaint, which references the non-custom
items.  Plaintiff does not dispute this
fact.   Rather, Plaintiff argues that “there
is no requirement that the amount alleged in the Complaint match the amount
stated in the writ of attachment.” 
(Reply 2.)  That argument does not
address the court’s concern.  In this
case, Plaintiff is not seeking attachment for an amount that deviates from the
amount pleaded in the complaint.  Instead,
Plaintiff seeks writs of attachment based on a contract claim, or “debt,” that
is not pleaded in the complaint. 
Therefore, the applications to increase the writs to include the custom
items are denied.  
 
            B.        Non-Custom Items 
 
            Plaintiff apparently seeks issuance of
additional writs of attachment for amounts that were included in the original
writs, so the application is denied with respect to these amounts.  However, the court grants the applications on
one narrow basis.  In the original
applications, Plaintiff elected not to pursue attachment of $70,881.54, and
Plaintiff did not expressly waive its claim to this amount for certain unpaid
invoices.  Specifically, Plaintiff’s
November 21, 2023, application included the following statement: 
 
NOTE: To streamline the issuance of the
Order on this Application, the amount sought to be attached by this Application
is a partial request and does not reflect the entire amount currently owed to
Prime Electric…. This Application only seeks the $316,885.28 principal claimed
due for the non-custom items. For purposes of this Application only and while
disputed, Prime Electric provides credit of $70,881.54 to appease LA Solar’s
claims that it is owed a credit. Prime Electric disputes that $70,881.54 in
credit is owed to LA Solar. Nothing contained in this Application is an
admission or concession of the $70,881.54 credit claimed by Defendant ….
 
(Application
for Writ of Attachment, dated November 21, 2023, at 2.)  For the reasons discussed in Judge Beckloff’s
order granting the original applications for writs of attachment, Plaintiff is
entitled to this amount.  By contrast,
Defendants have not demonstrated that they are, in fact, entitled to this
offset.  (See Code Civ. Proc. §
483.015(b); Lydig
Construction, Inc. v. Martinez Steel Corp. (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 937, 945.)  Therefore, the applications are granted in
this narrow respect.
 
            C.        Prejudgment Interest 
 
Plaintiff seeks prejudgment
interest on various amounts.  As
discussed, the court denies the applications with respect to custom items.  However, the court grants the applications
with respect to non-custom items for the time of September 20, 2022, to
November 14, 2023.  Plaintiff has provided sufficient
calculations proving that Plaintiff is entitled to: (1) an additional writ
against Petrosyan in the amount of $14,646.26 ($65,478.05 minus $50,831.79) to
account for such interest; and (2) an additional writ against LA Solar in the
amount of $36,376.69 to account for such interest.  (See Apanian Decl. Exh. F; see also
Application re: LA Solar at 6:16-7:12 [interest at 10% pursuant to Civ. Code §
3289 as to LA Solar].)  Defendants have
not responded to, or rebutted, those interest calculations.
 
D.        Attorneys’ Fees and Costs 
   
Finally,
Plaintiff
seeks additional writs of attachment that include attorney’s fees of
$134,823.50 and costs of $10,053.67. 
(Ammari Decl. ¶ 35; Apanian Decl. ¶¶ 9-22 & Exh. 7.) Pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 482.110(b), “the amount to be secured by the
attachment may include an estimated amount for costs and allowable attorney’s
fees.”  Thus, even if the costs or fees
have not yet been incurred, the trial court has discretion to include an
estimate of such costs or fees in the attachment.  Judge Beckloff included $20,000 in attorney’s
fees and $435 in filing fees and $549.70 in service of process fees in the
original writs of attachment.  In his
order, Judge Beckloff found that Plaintiff’s attorney had not justified higher
estimates of fees and costs.  With
respect to fees, Judge Beckloff also found based on “the nature of the action
and the court’s familiarity with attorney’s fees generally,” that $20,000 was a
reasonable estimate of fees “for this collection action.”  (See Court’s Order, dated December 20, 2023,
at 3.)  With respect to costs, Judge
Beckloff reasoned that Plaintiff had not submitted any evidence to justify
requests to attach around $5,000 in costs for efiling fees and deposition fees.  (Ibid.)  
 
            Judge
Beckloff made a factual finding, based on the evidence presented in Plaintiff’s
original application, concerning the appropriate estimates of fees and costs for
this action.  Plaintiff did not move for
reconsideration of that order or file a declaration that complies with section
1008(b) for a “renewed” motion for attachment of fees and costs.  Therefore, the court applies these amounts to
the new applications.  
 
            E.         Undertaking 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
489.210 requires the plaintiff to file an undertaking before issuance of a writ
of attachment.  Section 489.220 provides,
with exceptions, for an undertaking in the amount of $10,000.  Neither party addresses the undertaking
requirement in their briefs.  Since
Plaintiff seeks an “additional” writ of attachment as to each defendant, it
appears Plaintiff must also file a new undertaking for each writ.  (See Code Civ. Proc. § 484.370.)  Therefore, the court orders Plaintiff to post
another undertaking of $10,000 for each writ. 
  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
            1.         Plaintiff’s applications for additional
writs of attachment are granted in part and denied in part.
 
            2.         The writ against LA Solar Group, Inc.
currently stands at $266,988.44.  The court orders that this writ shall
be increased by: (a) An additional $70,881.54 for the non-custom goods; (b)
Prejudgment interest in the amount of $36,376.69; and (c) Attorneys’ fees and
costs in the amount of $25,000. 
Therefore, the total writ against LA Solar Group, Inc. shall be $399,246.67.  
 
            3.         The writ against Ara Petrosyan
currently stands at $52,428.29.  The
court orders that this writ shall be increased by: (a) An additional $70,881.54
for the non-custom goods; (b) Prejudgment interest of $14,646.26; and (c)
Attorneys’ fees and costs in the amount of $25,000.  Therefore, the total writ against Ara
Petrosyan shall be $164,956.09.  
 
            4.         Plaintiff shall post an additional
undertaking of $10,000 for each writ.
 
            5.         Plaintiff’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of service with the court.  
 
 
Order #2 of 2
[Tentative] Order
Denying Motion to Release Attachment
 
            Plaintiff
Prime Electric Wholesale Corporation (“Plaintiff”) filed this breach of
contract action against LA Solar Group, Inc. (“LA Solar”) and Ara Petrosyan
(“Petrosyan”).  Plaintiff alleges that LA
Solar breached the contract by failing to pay $327,496.14.  Plaintiff alleges a breach of a personal
guaranty against Petrosyan as the fifth cause of action.  
 
On December 20, 2023, the court
(Beckloff, J.) issued writs of attachment against Petrosyan and LA Solar.  The writ against LA Solar was in the amount
of $266,988.44 based upon the following calculations: (1) An invoice to LA
Solar in the amount of $316,885.28; (2) A credit of $70,881.54; (3) A filing
fee of $435; (4) Service of process fees of $549.70; and (5) Attorney’s fees of
$20,000. The writ against Petrosyan was in the same amount based upon
Petrosyan’s guaranty agreement, which included interest, so Judge Beckloff
added an additional $50,841.79, for a total of $317,820.23. It appears that
Judge Beckloff intended the writs of attachment to be joint and several because
they are based upon the same damages (except the additional interest against
Petrosyan).
 
On April 9, 2024, the parties
modified the writ of attachment against Petrosyan to release his house for sale
on the condition that Plaintiff receives the excess proceeds and agrees to
reduce the writ by a commensurate amount. 
The parties confirmed that Plaintiff received $265,391.94 from the sale,
leaving $52,428.29 on the writ of attachment against Petrosyan.  The Sheriff’s Department has levied an
account with $155,298.08. Defendants seek to release $102,869.79, arguing that
the writs are joint and several.
 
The court agrees with Defendants’
counsel that the writs of attachment were intended to be joint and several,
which means that both writs would be satisfied once $317,820.23 is
attached.  That has occurred.  Nevertheless, the court denies Defendants’
motion to release attachment of the excess funds.  When the parties stipulated to modify the
writ of attachment against Ara Petrosyan (in the amount of $317,820.33), they
agreed that “[t]he writ of attachment against LA Solar Group, Inc., dated
January 23, 2024, in the amount of $266,988.44 shall not be affected by this
order.”  (See Court’s Order, dated April
9, 2024.)  Thus, the following amounts
remain subject to attachment: (1) $52,428.29 on the writ of attachment against
Petrosyan, and (2) $266,988.44 on the writ against LA Solar.  The account with $155,298.09 does not exceed
these amounts. 
 
Regardless, the court has granted
Plaintiff’s application to increase the writ against LA Solar by approximately
$132,000 and the writ against Petrosyan by approximately $110,000.  Therefore, even if the court credited LA
Solar for the proceeds of the sale of Petrosyan’s house, there still would not
be a basis to release the attached funds.  

 
Based upon the foregoing, the court
orders as follows:
 
1.         Defendants’
motion to release attachment of $102,869.89 is denied.
 
2.         Plaintiff’s
counsel shall provide notice and file proof of service with the court.
