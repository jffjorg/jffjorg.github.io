And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants in part and denies in part Plaintiff Prime Electric Wholesale Corporation's application for additional writs of attachment against Defendants Ara Petrosyan and LA Solar Group, Inc. The judge denies the application to include amounts for custom items because the complaint does not plead a contract claim for those items. The judge grants the application to increase the writ against LA Solar by $70,881.54 for non-custom items and allows Plaintiff to attach an additional $36,376.69 in prejudgment interest. The judge also grants the application to increase the writ against Petrosyan by $70,881.54 for non-custom items and allows Plaintiff to attach an additional $14,646.26 in prejudgment interest. The judge denies Defendant's motion to release attachment of excess funds, finding that the writs of attachment are not joint and several.
