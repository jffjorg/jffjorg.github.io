And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment is denied without prejudice. The Plaintiff, Employers Choice Online, Inc., alleges that the Defendant, Wrinkle Free It, Inc., failed to recover data from a damaged Hard Drive, which contained valuable information, and seeks judgment against the Defendant for damages. The Plaintiff has submitted declarations and evidence in support of its damages, but the Judge finds that the calculation of damages is unclear and requires further information. The Judge has previously continued the hearing for the Plaintiff to provide further information on its calculation of damages, and the Plaintiff has submitted an additional declaration, but the Judge still finds that the calculation is unclear. Therefore, the Judge denies the Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice, allowing the Plaintiff to provide further evidence and clarification on its damages.
