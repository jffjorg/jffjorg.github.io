Further Responses to Form Interrogatories – Employment, Set One, and request

II. ANALYSIS
 
A.     Meet and
Confer Requirement 
 
A motion to compel further discovery responses
must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration stating “facts showing a
reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue
presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2031.310, subd. (b)(2);
2016.040.)¿ 
 
Here, Defendant’s counsel declares that a meet and confer
letter was sent to Plaintiff’s counsel on April 29, 2023 explaining why the
discovery responses were deficient and requesting supplemental responses. (Whang
Decl., ¶ 7.) Defendant did
not receive a response. (Id., ¶ 8.) The Court finds
that counsel has satisfied the meet and confer requirements under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (b)(2). 
 
B.     Discussion
 
Defendant moves
to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to Form Interrogatories – Employment,
Set One.
 
“Unless
otherwise limited by order of the court in accordance with this title, any
party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is
relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action or to the
determination of any motion made in that action, if the matter either is itself
admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.) 
 
A motion to
compel further responses to interrogatories may be brought based on: (1)
incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or incomplete
claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.300(c).) 
 
It is not
necessary for the motion to show that the material sought will be admissible in
evidence. “Good cause” may be found to justify discovery where specific facts
show that the discovery is necessary for effective trial preparation or to
prevent surprise at trial. (See Associated Brewers Dist. Co. v. Superior Court
(1967) 65 Cal.2d 583, 586-588; see also Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2017.010,
2019.030(a)(1) (Information is discoverable if it is itself admissible in
evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence and it is not unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is
obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or
less expensive.); Lipton v. Superior Court (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1599,
1611-1612 (noting a party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not
privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending
action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence).) 
 
If a timely
motion to compel has been filed, the burden is on the responding party to
justify any objection or failure fully to answer. (Coy v. Superior Court
(1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220–221 [addressing a motion to compel further responses
to interrogatories]; see also Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000)
22 Cal.4th 245, 255.) 
 
Furthermore,
to the extent there is any doubt in whether these records should be
discoverable, California’s liberal approach to discovery provides that doubt
should be resolved in favor of permitting discovery. (Pacific Tel. &
Tel. Co. v. Superior Court (1970) 2 Cal.3d 161, 173.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff responded to every
Form Interrogatory – Employment request, nos. 200.1, 200.2, 200.3, 200.4, 200.5, 200.6, 201.1, 202.1, 202.2,
203.1, 204.1, 204.2, 204.3, 204.4, 204.5, 204.6, 204.7, 205.1, 207.2, 208.1,
209.1, 210.1, 210.2, 210.3, 210.4, 210.5, 210.6, 212.1, 212.2, 212.3, 212.4,
212.5, 212.6, 212.7, 213.1, 213.2, 215.1, 215.2, with the same
objection: 
 
“Plaintiff objects to this request to the extent that it seeks
confidential, trade secret, proprietary, financial, and/or commercially
sensitive information that is privileged and/or confidential and protected from
disclosure by applicable law. Plaintiff objects to this request on the ground
that the information sought is in the possession of, known to, or otherwise
equally available to the propounding party. Plaintiff objects to this request
on the grounds that it seeks information that is neither relevant to the
subject matter of this action nor reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence. Plaintiff objects to this Form
Interrogatories to the extent that it seeks disclosure of copies of and/or
information contained within Plaintiff's federal and/or state tax returns.
Plaintiff objects to this request to the extent it seeks information protected
from disclosure by the attorney work-product rule. Plaintiff objects on the
grounds that the Interrogatory is vague and ambiguous.”
 
Defendant asserts that Plaintiff’s boilerplate objections are too
general and unmeritorious because they do not state how or why Plaintiff
believes Defendant’s Interrogatories are not reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of admissible evidence or in what way they are confidential,
vague or ambiguous. The Court agrees, and notes that Plaintiff has failed to
oppose the instant motion. Accordingly, the Court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s
further responses to Form Interrogatories – General, Set One. 
 
C.     Sanctions
 
“A request for a sanction shall, in the notice of
motion, identify every person, party, and attorney against whom the sanction is
sought, and specify the type of sanction sought. The notice of motion shall be
supported by a memorandum of points and authorities, and accompanied by a
declaration setting forth facts supporting the amount of any monetary sanction
sought.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.040.) 
 
Sanctions
may be imposed for misuse of discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., section 2023.030, subd. (a).
) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery
constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., section
2023.010, subd. (d).) Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348 provides that a court
may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a
motion to compel discovery even if no opposition was filed.  
 
Here, the
Court finds that Plaintiff engaged in the misuse of the discovery process by
failing to make good faith efforts to respond to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories - Employment. Defendant requests $2,650 in sanctions for
counsel’s work on this motion, including 5 hours spent on the instant motion
and an anticipated 5 additional hours to review the opposition, prepare a reply
and appear at the hearing. The Court finds sanctions are warranted. However, since no opposition was filed, the Court awards
sanctions in the reduced total amount of $1,590 (6 hours of attorney time at
the billing rate of $265 an hour.)
 
III. DISPOSITION
 

Defendant’s
Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s further response to Form Interrogatories –
Employment Law, Set One is GRANTED. Plaintiff shall provide verified responses
within 30 days. 
 
The
Court further GRANTS Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff in the reduced amount of $1,590.
Said monetary sanctions are to be paid to counsel for Defendant within 30 days
of the date of this order.
