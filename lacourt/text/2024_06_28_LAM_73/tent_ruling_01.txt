pLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR ENTRY OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT (filed 3/27/2024) 
 
TENTATIVE RULING 
 
The Court denies Plaintiff’s request for
entry of default judgment without prejudice.  
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On January 12,
2023, Plaintiff Employers Choice Online, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action against Defendant Wrinkle Free It, Inc. (“Defendant”) alleging causes of
action for:
 
            C/A 1: Gross Negligence
            C/A 2: Conversion
            C/A 3: Intentional Misrepresentation
and Intentional Concealment 
 
Plaintiff alleges the following. Plaintiff is engaged in
the business of performing background screening services, drug and health
screening services, drug and health screening services, screening software and
technology services for employers wishing to provide a safe, comfortable work
environment for their employees. In connection with Plaintiff's operation of
its business, it utilized a business computer laptop "the Laptop",
whose Hard Drive disk ("the Hard Drive") contained valuable
information about Plaintiff's hundreds of clients, their contact information,
and details about services which Plaintiff has provided to them over the years
and were currently providing to them. Plaintiff began contracting with
Defendant in or about August 2021, to provide to Plaintiff information
technology services. In or about October 2021, the Hard Drive became damaged
and Plaintiff was unable to 14 access the information in it and contacted
Defendant about recovering the data. On or about May 20, 2022, Defendant notified
Plaintiff that the Hard Drive was disposed of. Plaintiff never authorized the
destruction of the Hard Drive and Plaintiff never received any such notice that
the Hard Drive would be destroyed. Based on Plaintiff's income and expenses,
and profit and loss from the preceding and following Defendant's mishandling,
loss or destruction of the Hard Drive, Plaintiff has sustained damages from
loss of business profits and to replace the missing laptop. 
 
On April 20, 2023, default was entered against Defendant.  
 
On
April 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed an OSC re: Default Judgment. Plaintiff seeks judgment against Defendants
in the total amount of $195,547.58, consisting of the amount demanded in the
complaint of $195,028.23 and $519.35 in costs.

Here,
Plaintiff submitted JC Form CIV-100, a summary of the case, and the declarations of: (1) George Ramos, President of Employers
Choice Online, Inc., (2) Patricia Kotze, Vice-President of Employers Choice
Online, Inc., and (3) Loretta Ventura, the accounting manager of Employers
Choice Online, Inc. Kotze attaches to her declaration emails between her and
Defendant’s employees, indicating that the Hard Drive had been disposed of.
(Kotze Decl., Exhibit 1, pp., 8, 12.) 
 
On
May 16, 2024, the Court held an OSC hearing on Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment. The
Court did not find that Plaintiff adequately supported its damages and
continued the hearing for Plaintiff to provide further information on its
calculation of damages. 
 
On
May 23, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel, David Scott Kadin, submitted a declaration stating
that Ms. Ventura’s declaration provided the calculation of Plaintiff’s damages.
 
However,
the Court finds that it is still unclear how Plaintiff calculated its damages. Ms.
Ventura states that she is the accounting manager of Employers Choice Online,
Inc. and is familiar with Plaintiff's sales, expenses, income and expense records, profit
and loss statements and other financial records. (Ventura Decl., ¶ 1.) In support, Ms. Ventura only provides a
spreadsheet that she attests is kept in the normal course of Plaintiff’s
business in which she calculated Plaintiff’s loss of net profits for 2021-2024.
(Ventura Decl., Ex. 1.) Ms. Ventura’s declaration also states that there is a
substantial probability that Plaintiff’s losses of net profits will continue. (Ventura
Decl., ¶ 3.) Ms. Ventura then states that she
estimates the additional losses to be $28,256.31 for 4/16/24-12/31/24;
$53,069.57 for 2025; and $22,864.72 for 2026. (Ibid.) However, Ms.
Ventura does not clarify how she calculated these additional losses. They do
not appear to be referenced in the attached spreadsheet, nor does she provide the
basis for how she calculated these future losses. Plaintiff also does not
provide any further evidence of its income or expenses.  
 
Thus, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for
entry of default judgment without prejudice.  
 
III. CONCLUSION 
 
The Court denies Plaintiff’s request for
entry of default judgment without prejudice.
