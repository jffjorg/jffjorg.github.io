And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motions for an order compelling the plaintiff to provide responses to special interrogatories, form interrogatories, and request for production of documents. The defendant had requested sanctions for the plaintiff's counsel's failure to respond timely to these requests. However, the court finds substantial justification for the counsel's failure to respond due to his experience of medical challenges, including flu, pneumonia, and COVID-19, which caused him to fall behind in his work responsibilities. As a result, the court denies the defendant's requests for sanctions and orders.
