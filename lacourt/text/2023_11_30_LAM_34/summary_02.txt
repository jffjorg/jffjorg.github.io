Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Defendant's Counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed on November 1, 2023, and no opposition was filed. The judge notes that the motion does not comply with all the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, as it lacks a proposed order granting the motion. However, this issue can be easily remedied at the hearing. The judge also finds that the withdrawal of counsel would result in prejudice to the Defendant, as the case is scheduled to go to trial in less than two months and corporations cannot represent themselves in court. The judge expresses concern about the late timing of the motion and the lack of evidence of mandatory withdrawal.
