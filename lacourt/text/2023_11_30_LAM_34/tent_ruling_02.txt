ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
An attorney moving to be relieved
as counsel under California Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) must meet
the requirements set out in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. 
 
To comply with rule 3.1362, the
moving party must submit the following forms: (1) Notice of Motion and Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel; (2) Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to
be Relieved as Counsel; and (3) Order Granting Attorney's Motion to be Relieved
as Counsel. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a), (c), (e).) 
 
The moving party must serve the
aforementioned forms on the client and all other parties who have appeared in
the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) Further, when the client is
served by mail, the attorney's declaration must show that the client's address
was confirmed within the last 30 days and how it was confirmed. (Id.)  
 
Absent a showing of resulting
prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be granted. (People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
 
II.      
Discussion
 
Counsel’s Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel does not comply with all of the requirements of California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362. Although Counsel provided a motion to be relieved as
counsel and a declaration in support of the motion to be relieved as counsel,
Counsel did not provide a proposed order granting attorney’s motions to be
relieved as counsel. However, this issue can be easily remedied at the hearing.
 
The declaration states: (1) that
Defendant Swall Heights, LLC has been uncooperative in preparing a defense in
this case; (2) that there have been issues with communication on a variety of
case-related issues; and (3) that there are confidential issues subject to
attorney-client privilege that render it impracticable for RELAW to continue to
effectively represent Defendant Swall Heights, LLC. 
 
Trial is scheduled for January 22,
2024, which is less than two months from now. There is a very high risk of
prejudice to Defendant Swall Heights, LLC by this withdrawal, both because of
the quickly-approaching trial date and because, aside from narrow exceptions
such as in small claims court, the California Supreme Court has long held that
corporations cannot represent themselves in propria persona. (Merco Constr. Eng’rs, Inc. v. Mun. Ct. (1978) 21
Cal.3d.724, 730.)
 
        This case has
been ongoing for more than a year and half. It is unclear why Defense Counsel
has waited until this late date to move for withdrawal. Further, Defense
Counsel has not argued that there exist reasons for a mandatory withdrawal. 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel is DENIED.
