  Case Number:  20STCV34041    Hearing Date:   July 12, 2024    Dept:  57 PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM WAIVER OF OBJECTIONSThis motion is granted.  Plaintiff Alexandra Zarini has demonstrated that, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 2031.300 (a) (1) and (2),  she is entitled to relief from waiver of objections to Defendant Patricia Gucci's Request for Production of Documents, Set 5.  The Court will explain the basis of its decision at the hearing.PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR MODIFICATION OF PROTECTIVE ORDER The hearing on this motion is continued to meet Defendant Gucci's Motion Supporting Confidentiality Designations of Written Discovery Responses.  The Court is taking this action because of the overlap between the two motions.  Gucci's motion is set for hearing on August 21, 2024.  The Court is inclined to hear these two overlapping motions on August  12, 2024 at 8:30 a.m, instead of August 21.  The case already is on calendar on August 12, 2024 at 8:30 for a Motion of Zarini to Compel Gucci to Provide Further Responses to Zarini's Request for Production of Documents.  Under this plan, the Court would thus hear three motions in this case on August 12:  Zarini's Motion for Modification of the Protective Order; Gucci's Motion Supporting Confidentiality Designations; and Zarini's Motion to Compel Gucci to Provide Further Responses to Zarini's Request for Production of Documents.
