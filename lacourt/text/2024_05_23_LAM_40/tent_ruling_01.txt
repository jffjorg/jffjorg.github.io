  Insurance Company’s Petition to Compel Arbitration and Stay Trial Court
  Proceedings.



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiffs Ashley
Stottlemeyer and Katrenia Stottlemeyer (Katrenia), by and through her guardian
ad litem Ashley Stottlemeyer, sue Defendants Blue Cross of California dba Anthem Blue Cross and Anthem Blue
Cross Life and Health Insurance Company (collectively Anthem Blue Cross)
pursuant to a November 27, 2023, First Amended Complaint (FAC) alleging claims
of (1) Negligence and (2) Promissory Fraud.
The claims arise from the following allegations, contained in the first
paragraph of the FAC. Katrenia
was being treated for a serious health condition that threatened her life. Anthem
Blue Cross decided that they would no longer cover this treatment on the basis
it was not “medically necessary.” This decision was wrong and known by Anthem
Blue Cross to be wrong, given the medical information and other information
that was provided to Anthem Blue Cross by Katrenia’s mother, Ashley, which,
demonstrated that the elements of the group health contract’s definition of
medical necessity were met. Even after Ashley filed appeals from Anthem Blue
Cross’s wrongful denial of further treatment of Katrenia, Anthem Blue Cross continued
to ignore the facts and simply reiterated their erroneous position, breaking
their promise to provide a full and fair review of any denied claim. Anthem
Blue Cross’s failure to correct their decision was part of Anthem Blue Cross’s broken
“grievance” system of failing to properly address and resolve member appeals
resulting in further harm to covered members needing health care.
B. Motion Before the
Court
On February 9, 2024, Anthem Blue Cross filed a petition to compel
arbitration of Plaintiffs’ claims and to stay this action pending the outcome
of arbitration. Anthem Blue Cross brings their motion pursuant to the Federal
Arbitration Act (FAA) or to the California Arbitration Act (CAA), and pursuant
to two alleged agreements between Plaintiffs and third parties, to be read in
conjunction, with equitable estoppel and other principles allowing Anthem Blue
Cross to invoke the purported arbitration clause.
On April 11, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an opposition to Anthem Blue Cross’s
motion.
On May 1, 2024, Anthem Blue Cross filed a reply to Plaintiffs’
opposition.
On May 13, 2024 Plaintiff filed a notice of new authority, and objections
to the evidence submitted by Defendants in the Reply. On May 21, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a second notice of new authority in opposition to Defendant's petition to
compel arbitration. The two new authorities need not be considered to reach the
Court’s ruling below.
Anthem Blue Cross’s motion is now before the Court.
 
II. Petition to Compel
Arbitration: GRANTED.

Legal Standard
The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) applies in California
courts in matters concerning interstate commerce and requires state courts to
enforce arbitration agreements as required by the federal common law developed
under the FAA. (See Southland Corp. v. Keating (1984) 465 U.S. 1, 15-16
(Southland Corp.); Broughton v. Cigna Healthplans (1999) 21
Cal.4th 1066, 1074-78, superseded by statute on another ground as stated in Ferguson
v. Corinthian Colleges, Inc. (9th Cir. 2013) 733 F.3d 928, 937.).) The FAA
preempts and invalidates state law and state judicial decisions that disfavor
arbitration or require arbitration provisions to pass higher scrutiny. (Southland
Corp., supra, at p. 12; Perry v. Thomas (1987) 482 U.S. 483,
490.) If the parties designate the FAA applies, then California arbitration law
is preempted. (See, e.g., Rodriguez v. American Techs., Inc. (2006) 136
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1121-1122.)  Where the FAA is found not to apply, the
California Arbitration Act (Code Civ. Proc. § 1280 et seq.) applies. (See Valencia
v. Smyth (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 153, 178 (Valencia).)
 A court’s inquiry is limited to a
determination of (1) whether a valid arbitration agreement exists and (2)
whether the arbitration agreement covers the dispute. (9 U.S.C. § 4; Chiron
Corp. v. Ortho Diagnostics Systems, Inc. (9th Cir. 2000) 207 F.3d 1126,
1130; Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. (2002) 537 U.S. 79, 84; see Simula,
Inc. v. Autoliv, Inc. (9th Cir. 1999) 175 F.3d 716, 720 [if the finding is
affirmative on both counts the FAA requires the Court to enforce the
arbitration agreement in accordance with its terms]; see Omar v. Ralphs
Grocery Co. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 955, 961 [In determining the
enforceability of an arbitration agreement, the court first considers “two
‘gateway issues’ of arbitrability: (1) whether there was an agreement to
arbitrate between the parties, and (2) whether the agreement covered the
dispute at issue”] Lacayo v. Cataline Restaurant Group Inc. (2019) 38
Cal.App.5th 244, 257 (Lacayo) [Where moving party meets initial burden,
“the party opposing arbitration must prove by a preponderance of the evidence
any defense to the petition”].)
“An order to arbitrate the particular
grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance
that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers
the asserted dispute.” (United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior & Gulf
Navigation Co. (1960) 363 U.S. 574, 582-583.) 
 Moreover, the general rule is that the
FAA governs all agreements to arbitrate in contracts “involving interstate
commerce.” (Higgins v. Superior Court (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1238,
1247.) The term “involving” commerce “is broad and is indeed the functional
equivalent of “affecting’ commerce.” (Allied-Bruce Terminix Companies, Inc.
v. Dobson (1995) 513 U.S. 265, 273-274.) The U.S. Supreme Court has held
that this broad interpretation includes employment contracts. (See Circuit
City Stores v. Adams (2001) 532 U.S. 105, 106.) The defendant bears the
burden of proving applicability of the FAA by showing that its activities
constitute interstate commerce. (Hoover v. Am. Income Life Ins. Co.
(2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1207.) Failure to demonstrate that the employment
agreement affects interstate commerce renders the FAA inapplicable. (See Lane
v. Francis Capital Management LLC (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 676, 687-688 (Lane);
Woolls v. Superior Court (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 197, 212.)
Even where the FAA governs the
interpretation of arbitration clauses, California law governs whether an
arbitration agreement has been formed in the first instance. (Baker v.
Osborne Development Corp. (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 884, 893.) 

C.
Analysis
1. Whether There is An Agreement to
Arbitrate Between the Parties
a. Relevant Law
“Parties
are not required to arbitrate their disagreements unless they have agreed to do
so. [Citation.] A contract to arbitrate will not be inferred absent a ‘clear
agreement.’ [Citation.] When determining whether a valid contract to arbitrate
exists, we apply ordinary state law principles that govern contract formation.
[Citation] In California, a ‘clear agreement’ to arbitrate may be either
express or implied in fact. [Citation.]” (Davis v. Nordstrom, Inc. (9th
Cir. 2014) 755 F.3d 1089, 1092-93 [applying California law].) The court is only
required to make a finding of the agreement’s existence, not an evidentiary
determination of its validity. (Condee v. Longwood Management Corp.
(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 215, 219.)
b. Court’s Determination
Here,
the Court finds that no agreement to arbitrate exists between the parties.
First,
as to the purported electronic enrollment application for health coverage with
the County submitted around November 22, 2022, there is insufficient
authentication of an electronic signature. (Mot., DiDomenico Decl., Ex. 2
[purported electronic application].)
California
case law has held that an electronic signature was properly authenticated when
a declarant “detailed [the company’s] security precautions regarding
transmission and use of an applicant’s unique username and password, as well as
the steps an applicant would have to take to place his or her name on the
signature line of the employment agreement …,” such that, “[b]ased on this
procedure, [the declarant] concluded that the ‘name [of the employee] could
have only been placed on the signature pages of the employment agreement … by
someone using [the employee’s] unique user name and password,’” and that “
[g]iven this process for signing documents and protecting the privacy of the
information with unique and private user names and passwords, the electronic
signature was made by [the employee] on the employment agreement … at the date,
time, and IP address listed on the documents.” (Espejo v. Southern
California Permanente Medical Group (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1047, 1062 (Espejo).)
The
circumstances here in the six paragraphs of the DiDomenico declaration are
completely distinguishable from the standard set out in Espejo. 
Instead,
the DiDomenico declaration more closely resembles the circumstances in Ruiz
v. Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc., supra, 232 Cal.App.4th at p. 844. There,
the court of appeal held that an electronic signature was not verified when the
“[declarant] only offered her unsupported assertion that [the employee] was the
person who electronically signed the 2011 agreement” instead of explaining how
“an electronic signature in the name of ‘[the employee]’ could only have been
placed on the 2011 agreement (i.e., on the employee acknowledgement form) by a person
using [the employees]’s ‘unique login ID and password,’” with “the date and
time printed next to the electronic signature indicat[ing] the date and time
the electronic signature was made,” and where “all … employees were required to
use their unique login ID and password when they logged into the HR system and
signed electronic forms and agreements,” such that “the electronic signature on
the … agreement was, therefore, apparently made by [the employee] on [the
specified time and date].” (Ruiz v. Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc., supra,
232 Cal.App.4th at p. 844.)
The
motion’s Kim declaration and the reply’s Barrera declaration do not remedy this
problem. And the opposition raises issues as to whether DiDomenico had the
personal knowledge and foundational basis for her declaration, which appear well
taken (she did not take the screenshots, but rather received them from a subcontractor,
who received them from the administrator of the electronic enrollment process).
The
burden of persuasion is always on the moving party to prove the existence of an
arbitration agreement with the opposing party by a preponderance of the
evidence. (Gamboa v. Northeast Community Clinic (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th
158, 164-165, citations omitted.) Here, because the DiDomenico declaration more
closely resembles Ruiz than Espejo, Anthem Blue Cross has failed
to show by a preponderance of the evidence that an agreement to arbitrate
arises from the purported electronic enrollment application for health coverage
with the County submitted around November 22, 2022. 
The
Court turns now to the the Benefit Booklet.
Anthem
Blue Cross is by the terms of the Benefit Booklet not one of the parties that
can invoke the arbitration agreement therein. “The member [Plaintiffs] and the
plan administrator [PRISM] agree to be bound by this Binding Arbitration
provision and acknowledge that they are each giving up their right to a trial
by court or jury.” (Mot., DiDomenico Decl., Ex. 1, pp. 159 [quoted language],
167-168 [defining member as subscriber or dependent], 171 [“refers to PRISM”].)
Anthem
Blue Cross argues that this is not fatal because they may invoke the
arbitration clause under the doctrine of equitable estoppel. The Court agrees that
this doctrine supports compelling arbitration in this case.
Under
the doctrine of equitable estoppel, “a nonsignatory defendant may invoke an
arbitration clause to compel a signatory plaintiff to arbitrate its claims when
the causes of action against the nonsignatory are ‘intimately founded in and
intertwined’ with the underlying contract obligations.” (JSM Tuscany, LLC v.
Superior Court (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1222, 1237.)
The
doctrine applies in either of two circumstances: (1) when the signatory must
rely on the terms of the written agreement containing the arbitration clause in
asserting its claims against the nonsignatory; or (2) when the signatory
alleges “substantially interdependent and concerted misconduct” by the
nonsignatory against a signatory and the alleged misconduct is “founded in or
intimately connected with the obligations of the underlying agreement.” (Goldman
v. KPMG, LLP (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 209, 218-219.)
A
nonsignatory seeking to enforce an arbitration agreement has the burden to
establish at least one of these circumstances applies. (Jones v. Jacobson
(2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 1, 16.)
Anthem
Blue Cross argues that “[b]ecause Plaintiffs’ claims rely exclusively on
alleged improper conduct with respect to the utilization management review and
denial of treatment on the basis of medical necessity, Plaintiffs’ claims are
premised upon and inextricably tied to Plaintiffs’ Benefit Booklet and covered
under the arbitration provision.” (Mot., p. 13.)
It
is true, as argued by Plaintiffs, that Anthem Blue Cross has admitted to
drafting the Benefit Booklet with PRISM’s permission, which, as discussed
above, does not include Anthem Blue Cross as one of the parties that can invoke
the arbitration agreement. (Opp’n, Barrio Decl., Ex. 2, p. 5, ¶ l. & p. 15,
¶ a & Ex. 4, Lamb Deposition, 30:21-31:20 & Ex. 5, DiDomenico
Deposition, 34:8-36:16; see Reply, p. 5 [“Plaintiffs’ accusation that Anthem
drafted the Benefit Booklet with some nefarious hidden motive is the stuff of
fantasy”].) The arbitration provision repeatedly references arbitration between
the member and the plan administrator (Prism) but not the claims administrator –
Anthem. 
However,
despite Plaintiffs’ allegations that the Benefit Booklet is not critical to
their claims, the Complaint would seem to indicate otherwise.  Paragraph 10 of the Complaint first identifies
the Benefit Booklet and in its allegations thereafter it indicates that such
Booklet provides the parameters of this case. For example, in paragraphs 13 and
14 (and thereafter) Plaintiffs allege that the Benefit Booklet provided for
health care services to treat illnesses and injuries that are “medically
necessary” and that it thereafter defined the term “medically necessary.” The
breach of contract and implied covenant claims are dependent on the Booklet
providing the terms of the contract. The third cause of action for negligence also
refers to the Booklet at paragraph 37.  Accordingly,
the Complaint here supports Anthem’s argument that equitable estoppel is
appropriate here under the theory that a “nonsignatory may compel a signatory
to arbitrate its claims when the signatory’s claims are based upon  and intertwined with a contract containing an
arbitration agreement.” (Turtle Ridge Media Group, Inc. v. Pacific Bell
Directory (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 828, 833.)
2. Unconscionability
a. Relevant
Law
“Both procedural unconscionability
and substantive unconscionability must be shown [for a finding of
unconscionability to exist], but ‘they need not be present in the same degree’
and are evaluated on a ‘sliding scale.’ [Citation.] ‘[T]he more substantively
oppressive the contract term, the less evidence of procedural unconscionability
is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable, and vice
versa.” (Pinnacle Museum Tower Assn. v. Pinnacle Market Dev. (US), LLC
(2017) 55 Cal.4th 223, 247 (Pinnacle).)
Whether an arbitration provision is
unconscionable is a question of law. (Suh v. Superior Court (2010) 181
Cal.App.4th 1504, 1511-1512.)
Unconscionability is determined
from facts arising at the time the contract was made. (Martinez v. Master
Protection Corp. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 107, 116 (Martinez) [“‘The
critical juncture for determining whether a contract is unconscionable is the
moment when it is entered into by both parties—not whether it is unconscionable
in light of subsequent events,’” citation omitted]; see Code Civ. Proc., §
1670.5 [where the court as a matter of law finds the
contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made, the
court may refuse to enforce the contract, or it may enforce the remainder of
the contract without the unconscionable clause], limited on preemption grounds
in AT&T Mobility, LLC
v. Concepcion (2011) 563 U.S. 333, 340-350 (Concepcion) [limitation as to
class-action waivers in arbitration agreements].)
A party claiming that one or more
provisions of an arbitration agreement is unconscionable, must not only prove
unconscionability in the abstract, but also show how such unconscionability
specifically affects the party’s arbitration claim. (Chin v. Advanced Fresh
Concepts Franchise Corp. (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 704, 714 [partial
limitation on award of fees and costs for “all claims” limiting amount to
one-third of any compensatory damages awarded may be unconscionable, but is not
a defense in the absence of a showing that the party would in fact be entitled
to recover attorney’s fees], disagreed with in Tiri, supra, 226
Cal.App.4th at p. 241, fn. 4 [disagreement re: when to analyze delegation
clause issues].)
b. Court’s
Determination
The Court finds that the only
aspect of unconscionability that can be found is the fact that the contract is
one of adhesion. However, under the caselaw, a finding that a contract of
adhesion exists usually connotes a small degree of procedural unconscionability.
(See Dotson v. Amgen, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 975, 981 [discussing
low level of procedural unconscionability in the adhesion contract at issue and
going on to discuss substantive unconscionability]; Roman v. Superior Court
(2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1470, fn. 2 [“When bargaining power is not grossly
unequal and reasonable alternatives exist, oppression typically inherent in
adhesion contracts is minimal”].) The Court does not find any other procedural
unconscionability that is not also present in any arbitration agreement – i.e.,
repeat players. While this may be an issue for the Legislature, it is not
enough to decline to enforce an arbitration agreement given the current state
of the law. Nor does the Court find any substantive unconscionability based on
the Opposition’s arguments on this point. In terms of any differences between
the different arbitration provisions, as the Court is granting the petition to
compel arbitration under the Benefits Booklet, those will be the rules to apply
to the arbitration.
3. Disposition
Anthem Blue Cross’s motion is
GRANTED. 
III. Conclusion
Defendants Blue Cross of California
dba Anthem Blue Cross and Anthem Blue Cross Life and Health Insurance Company’s
Petition to Compel Arbitration and Stay Trial Court Proceedings is GRANTED. The
Court will set an OSC re: Status of Arbitration in approximately one year.
