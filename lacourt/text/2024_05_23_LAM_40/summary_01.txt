And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the petition to compel arbitration and stay trial court proceedings. The court finds that the parties agreed to arbitrate their disputes and that the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable. The court also finds that the doctrine of equitable estoppel applies, allowing the non-signatory defendant to compel the signatory plaintiff to arbitrate its claims. The court does not find any unconscionability in the arbitration agreement. The court sets an order to show cause regarding the status of the arbitration in approximately one year.
