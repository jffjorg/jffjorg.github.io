[1] The Court notes there is no Objection No. 5.


[2] The Court notes Defendant’s opposition is labeled on
the docket at “Memorandum of Points and Authorities” and does not provide the
Court notice that the filing is indeed the Defendant’s Opposition Plaintiff’s
Motion for Attorney’s Fees.  Defendant’s
counsel is advised to remedy this issue in future filings before this
Court.  Continuing the practice of filing
documents with ambiguous titles creates the potential of this Court not
reviewing Defendant’s improperly labeled filings.
