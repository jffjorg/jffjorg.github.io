file with the Los Angeles Superior Court in Case No. 20STCV03485, captioned Martha
Hernandez v. Feast Foods, LLC is denied as irrelevant.

file in this action, including without limitation the Declaration of Crystal
Sainz Ayala in Support of Motion to Compel Arbitration, filed in this action on

Evidentiary
Objections
Defendant’s
11/12/24 evidentiary objections to the Declaration of Chami (“Chami”) are
sustained as to Nos. 1 and 4, and overruled as to Nos. 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, and 14.[1]
 
Background
On February 21, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the operative Complaint against Defendant asserting claims for
retaliation, unpaid wages, and related claims arising out of her employment.
On September 18, 2023,
Defendant filed its Motion to Compel Arbitration, which Plaintiff opposed on
October 6, 2023.
On October 19, 2023, this
Court granted Defendants’ Motion to Compel Arbitration and ordered the matter
to arbitration. Shortly thereafter, the matter was submitted to AAA to
administer the arbitration.  (Decl. of
Chami ¶6, Exh. A.)
On May 9, 2024, Plaintiff
filed her Motion for An Order Withdrawing the Case from Arbitration Per C.C.P.
Section 1281.98, and a hearing was set for August 16, 2024.  (Decl. of Chami ¶17).
Defendant executed a
stipulation regarding the Court granting Plaintiff’s motion to withdraw from
arbitration and July 24, 2024, the parties filed a Stipulation and Proposed
Order Withdrawing the Case from Arbitration Per C.C.P. §1281.98 on July 24,
2024.  This Court promptly signed the
order, and the matter was withdrawn from arbitration on July 25, 2024.  (7/25/24 Joint Stipulation.)
Plaintiff filed the instant
motion on August 22, 2024.  Defendant
filed its opposition on November 12, 2024.[2]  Plaintiff filed her reply on November 18,
2024.
 
Discussion
C.C.P.
§1281.98(c) states:
If the employee or consumer
withdraws the claim from arbitration and proceeds in a court of appropriate
jurisdiction pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b), both of the
following apply:
 
(1)    The
employee or consumer may bring a motion, or a separate action, to recover all
attorney’s fees and all costs associated with the abandoned arbitration
proceeding. The recovery of arbitration fees, interest, and related attorney’s
fees shall be without regard to any findings on the merits in the underlying
action or arbitration.
 
(2)    The
court shall impose sanctions on the drafting party in accordance with Section
1281.99.
 
(C.C.P.
§1281.98(c).)
C.C.P. §1281.99
states: “[t]he court shall impose monetary sanctions against a
drafting party that materially breaches an arbitration agreement pursuant to .
. . subdivision (a) of Section 1281.98, by ordering the drafting party to pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees and costs, incurred by the
employee or consumer as a result of the material breach.”  (C.C.P. §1281.99(a), emphasis added.)
Here, after
protesting that the FAA exclusively controlled in this instance, per
stipulation, Defendant withdrew its claim from arbitration pursuant to C.C.P. §1281.98.
 (See 7/25/24 Joint Stipulation.)  Defendant thereby waived any argument that C.C.P.
§1281.98 was inapplicable.  Therefore,
Plaintiff is entitled under C.C.P. §1281.98(c)(1) to bring the instant motion
to “to recover all attorney’s fees and all costs associated with the abandoned
arbitration proceeding.”  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
motion for attorneys’ fees is proper and she is entitled to recover attorneys’
fees and costs associated with the abandoned arbitration proceeding.
 
Reasonable Fees
The California Supreme Court has determined
the lodestar method is the proper mechanism to calculate attorneys’ fees under
C.C.P. §425.16(c).  (See Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1136.) 
To calculate a lodestar amount, the Court must first determine the
reasonableness of the hourly rates sought by Defendant’s counsel.  The “reasonable hourly rate” applicable under
the lodestar method is the rate “prevailing in the community for similar work.”
 (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)  “The trial court
makes its determination after consideration of a number of factors, including
the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill
required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given, the success
or failure, and other circumstances in the case.”  (Id. at pg. 1096.)
Plaintiff’s Counsel declares her hourly rate
is $750 per hour.  (Decl. of Chami ¶¶21,
35, Exh. J.)  The Court determines based
on its experience that Plaintiff’s Counsel’s hourly rate is reasonable in her
community of practice.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s requested attorneys’ fees are
reasonable.
 
Billed Hours
The verified time entries of the attorneys
are entitled to a presumption of credibility, which extends to an attorney’s
professional judgment as to whether time spent was reasonably necessary to the
litigation.  (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396 [“We think
the verified time statements of the attorney as officers of the court are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.”].)  “California courts do not
require detailed time records, and trial courts have discretion to award fees
based on declarations of counsel describing the work they have done and the
court’s own view of the number of hours reasonably spent.”  (Syers
Properties III, Inc. v. Rankin
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 698-699.)
Here, Plaintiff is seeking recovery of
attorneys’ fees only related to the administration of the arbitration, the
opposition to Defendant’s petition compelling arbitration, the motion vacating
the order compelling arbitration and the instant motion for fees as a result of
the order vacating arbitration, spanning from September 18, 2023, through the
filing of the instant motion on August 22, 2024.
Plaintiff’s counsel declares she billed
71.60 hours related to the arbitration in this matter.  (Decl. of Chami ¶21, Exh. J.)
Plaintiff’s counsel also declares that she
anticipates spending another 3.0 hours preparing a reply brief to any
opposition filed by Defendant to the instant fee motion, and 1.0 hour preparing
for and appearing for the hearing on the instant motion scheduled for November
25, 2024.  (Decl. of Chami ¶22.)  Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion requests total
of 75.60 hours spent on this matter that is associated with the arbitration
and reimbursable under C.C.P §§1281.98-1281.99. (Decl. of Chami ¶¶21-23, Exh. J.)
Defendant opposes Plaintiff’s motion on the
basis Plaintiff’s fees are not reasonable. 
(Opposition, pgs. 8-10.)  Defendant
does not cite to specific examples in its motion of hours that were excessive
or unreasonable.  (Lunada Biomedical
v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488 [“In challenging attorney fees as
excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging
party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and
citations to the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive,
duplicative, or unrelated to not suffice.”].) Therefore, Defendant did not meet
its burden to challenge these fees.
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff should not be awarded the attorneys’ fees of $4,125.00
related to discovery conducted during the arbitration because discovery will
also be done in the state court action.  The
Court agrees. These fees were not not specific to the arbitration proceedings.  
Accordingly, the Court calculates the total attorneys’ fees
to be $56,700.00.
 
Costs
Plaintiff requests costs in the amount of $561.00.  Defendant does not challenge Plaintiff’s
request for costs, and such costs are substantiated in Plaintiff’s
invoices.  (See Decl. of Chami, Exh. N.)
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request for costs incurred from the
arbitration is granted in the amount of $561.00.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motion for attorneys’ fees and costs is granted in the total amount of $53,136.00, comprised of $52,575.00 in attorneys’ fees incurred from the abandoned
arbitration proceeding and $561.00 in costs.
