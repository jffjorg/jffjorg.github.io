HASSAN

         vs.
 
LOS
  ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT.


 Case No.: 
  22STCV31431
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  November 25, 2024



 

Defendant Los Angeles Unified School
District’s motion to compel Plaintiff Hassan Mateen to submit to an independent
mental examination including a comprehensive clinical interview and
psychological assessments is denied.
 
Defendant
Los Angeles Unified School District (“LAUSD”) (“Defendant”) moves to compel
Plaintiff Hassan Mateen (“Mateen”) (“Plaintiff”) to submit to an independent
mental examination (“IME”) including a comprehensive clinical interview and
psychological assessments in order to determine the nature and extent of Plaintiff’s
alleged psychological injuries and causation thereof.  (Notice Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §2032.020.)
 
Procedural
History
Defendant
filed the instant motion on August 2, 2024. 
Plaintiff filed his opposition on November 19, 2024.  As of the date of this hearing no reply has
been filed.
 
Legal
Standard
C.C.P
§2032.020(a) states: 
Any party may obtain discovery,
subject to the restrictions set forth in Chapter 5 (commencing with Section
2019.010), by means of a physical or mental examination of (1) a party to
the action, (2) an agent of any party, or (3) a natural person in the
custody or under the legal control of a party, in any action in which the
mental or physical condition . . . of that party or other person is in controversy in the action.
 
(C.C.P
§2032.020(a), emphasis added.)
C.C.P.
§2032.310 provides, “[i]f a party desires to obtain discovery by a mental
examination, . . . the party shall obtain leave of court.”  (C.C.P. §2032.310(a).)  “A motion for an examination under
subdivision (a) shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and
nature of the examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if any,
of the person or persons who will perform the examination.”  (C.C.P. §2032.310(b).)
 
Meet
and Confer
C.C.P.
§2032.310(b) provides, “A motion for an examination under subdivision (a) shall
specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the
examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if any, of the person
or persons who will perform the examination. The motion shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.”  (C.C.P. §2032.310(b), emphasis added.)
Defendant’s
counsel declares that she “sent an email meeting and conferring with
Plaintiff’s counsel regarding a stipulation to conduct the aforementioned
mental examination” on July 1, 2024. 
(Decl. of Rosenberg ¶7, Exh. F.)
Defendant’s
counsel demonstrates a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal
resolution of the issues presented in the instant motion.  Therefore, Defendant’s motion is appropriate.
 
Discussion
Defendant’s
motion is denied.  
Plaintiff
is a party to this action, and in his Complaint, Plaintiff has put his mental
and physical health into controversy.  (C.C.P
§2032.020(a).)  Plaintiff has alleged
specific emotional and psychological injuries as a result of the alleged adverse
employment action he suffered by Defendant.  Plaintiff’s Complaint alleges “mental anguish
and emotional distress” as a result of Defendant’s alleged conduct.  (Complaint, pgs. 4:21, 5:12, 6:15, 7:10, 8:4.)
 Similarly, in verified responses to
specially prepared discovery, Plaintiff alleged that he has suffered “emotional
anguish, distress, pain, and suffering including panic attacks, anxiety,
economic insecurity, stress, loss of enjoyment, loss of purpose, grief, pain,
humiliation, and sadness.  (Decl. of
Rosenberg ¶¶3-4, Exh. B at pgs. 9:23-25, 18:10-13, 27:3-6, 35:16-19, 43:26-28,
52:10-12; Exh. C at pgs. 13:24-14:7.)  Plaintiff also testified on January 29, 2024,
that his panic attacks and anxiety are ongoing.  (Decl. of Rosenberg ¶5, Exh. D at pgs. 154:8-155:14,
187:22-189:5.)  Plaintiff’s alleged mental
injuries are in dispute in this matter.  
However,
Defendant’s motion is not in compliance with C.C.P. §2032.310(b).  Defendant fails to include in its motion the
“time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination, as well
as the identity and the specialty, if any, of the person or persons who will
perform the examination.”  (C.C.P. §2032.310(b).)
Further,
Plaintiff notes in opposition that he has stipulated that no claim is being
made for mental and emotional distress over and above that usually associated
with the physical injuries claimed and that no expert testimony regarding this
usual mental and emotional distress will be presented at trial in support of
the claim for damages.  (C.C.P. §§2032.320(b),
(c).)
Defendant’s
attachment to the Declaration of Rosenberg, Exhibit G, even provides the email
sent by Plaintiff’s counsel stipulating to the terms of C.C.P. §2032.320(c).  (Decl. of Rosenberg ¶8, Exh. G at pg. 1.)
Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion is denied.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s
motion to compel Plaintiff to submit to an IME including a comprehensive
clinical interview and psychological assessments is denied.
Moving
Party to give notice.
