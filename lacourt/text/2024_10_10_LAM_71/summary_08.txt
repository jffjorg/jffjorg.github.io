And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff Renard Louis' motion for leave to file a first amended complaint, which adds new allegations to existing causes of action and a new cause of action for violation of Labor Code §1102.5. The judge finds that the motion substantially complies with the California Rules of Court and that the proposed amendments are necessary and proper. The judge also rejects Defendant County of Los Angeles' argument that Plaintiff unreasonably delayed in bringing the motion, finding that the delay was not prejudicial. Finally, the judge notes that it is improper to consider the validity of the proposed amended pleading on the instant motion, and that Defendant will have the opportunity to attack the validity of the amended pleading after it is filed. The judge orders Plaintiff to file the proposed first amended complaint with the Court within 10 days.
