And here is the English-text summary:

The judge issued a tentative ruling on October 10, 2024, in the case of Bear Valley 2005, LLC v. Mechanics Bank. Defendant Mechanics Bank demurred to Plaintiff Bear Valley 2005, LLC's second amended complaint, arguing that the 2nd and 3rd causes of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation, respectively, fail to state sufficient facts to constitute causes of action because they are barred by the economic loss rule. The judge reviewed the pleadings and found that the 2nd cause of action for fraud is not barred by the economic loss rule, as it alleges intentional fraud. However, the 3rd cause of action for negligent misrepresentation is barred by the economic loss rule, as it alleges mere negligence in Defendant's performance of the contract. Therefore, the judge overruled the demurrer as to the 2nd cause of action for fraud and sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the 3rd cause of action for negligent misrepresentation.
