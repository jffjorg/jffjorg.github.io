Moving Defendant William Wirshing, M.D.’s
motion in the alternative for summary adjudication of Plaintiffs Glenn Wright’s
and Nina Woolfork’s first amended complaint is denied as to Plaintiffs’ 2nd
cause of action for Violation of Elder Abuse and Dependent Adult Civil
Protection Act and claim for punitive damages.

1.     Defendant Wirshing’s MSJ
Defendant
William Wirshing, M.D. (“Wirshing”) (“Moving Defendant”) moves for summary
judgment of Plaintiffs Glenn Wright’s (“Glenn”) and Nina Woolfork’s (“Woolfork”)
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”), as successors-in-interest to Le’Wayne Anthony
Wright (“Decedent”) first amended complaint (“FAC”) on the grounds no genuine
issue of material fact exists regarding the application of C.C.P. §340.5, which
governs the statute of limitations in this medical malpractice case.  (Notice Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §437c(a)(1).)  
Moving
Defendant moves in the alternative for summary adjudication of Plaintiffs’ 2nd
cause of action for Violation of Elder Abuse and Dependent Adult Civil
Protection Act and claim for punitive damages. 
(Notice Motion, pgs. 2-3; C.C.P. §437c(f)(1).)  Moving Defendant moves on the ground the 2nd cause
of action lacks merit because Plaintiffs have failed to plead a theory of
dependent adult abuse and the evidence presented with this motion refutes such
a theory. (Notice Motion, pg. 2.)  Moving
Defendant argues the medical services he provided as a licensed professional
health care provider-psychiatrist to Decedent do not implicate dependent adult
abuse or neglect because the facts do not present issues of “custodial
caretaking,” a prerequisite for maintaining such a cause of action.  (Winn v. Pioneer Medical Group, Inc.
(2016) 63 Cal.4th 148, 152, following and explaining Delaney v. Baker
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 23, 34, and Covenant Care v. Superior Court (2000) 32
Cal.4th 771, 785.)  Moving Defendant
argues the facts pled and the evidence presented with this motion demonstrate
that Plaintiffs’ FAC implicates, at most, issues of standard of care relative
to the provision of professional medical services, not custodial
caretaking.  (Covenant Care, 32
Cal.4th at pgs. 783-785; Smith v. Ben Bennett, Inc. (2005) 133
Cal.App.4th 1507, 1522-1523.)

Request
for Judicial Notice
Plaintiffs’
9/19/24 request for judicial notice of (1) the March 14, 2022, Complaint filed
in United States District Court by Plaintiffs in Case No. 2:2022-CV-01693 (P-RJN,
Exh. A); (2) Plaintiffs’ Motion for the District Court in Case No.
2:2022-CV-01693 to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over
Plaintiffs’ state law claims (P-RJN, Exh. B); (3) the District Court’s order in
Case No. 2:2022-CV-01693 declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over
the Plaintiffs’ state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1367(d) (P-RJN, Exh. C);
(4) Plaintiffs’ July 7, 2021, petition in LASC Case No. 21STCV24977 to enforce
access to Decedent’s medical records (P-RJN, Exh. D); (5) the October 18, 2021,
order in LASC Case No. 21STCV24977 to enforce access to Decedent’s medical
records (P-RJN, Exh. E); and (6) Defendant Exodus Recovery, Inc.’s Fiscal
Compliance Review dated March 22, 2023, as it appears on the Los Angeles County
website (P-RJN, Exh. F), is granted.
 
CRC
Violation
CRC Rule 3.1350(d) provides:
(1)     
The Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in support of a
motion must
separately identify: 
(A)       
Each cause of action, claim for damages, issue of duty, or affirmative defense that is the
subject of the motion; and 
(B)       
Each supporting material fact claimed to be without dispute with
respect to the cause of action, claim for damages, issue of duty, or
affirmative defense that is the subject of the motion. 
 
(CRC, Rule 3.1350(d), emphasis
added.)
Moving Defendant’s separate
statement is in violation of CRC, Rule 3.1350(d).  Moving Defendant’s separate statement fails
to separately set out each cause of action that is the subject of the motion.  (CRC, Rule 3.1350(d)(1)(A).)  Accordingly, Moving Defendant’s motion for
summary judgment is denied.  
Curiously, Moving Defendant only
follows CRC Rule 3.1350 as it pertains to the second cause of action and claim
for punitive damages on his motion for summary adjudication, as provided in
Moving Defendant’s notice of motion. 
Further, Moving Defendant fails to include notice of his intent to move
for summary adjudication of the 4th cause of action for wrongful death.  (See Notice Motion, pg. 2.) 
Therefore, this Court cannot rule on Moving Defendant’s motion for
summary adjudication of the 4th cause of action.
 
Background
Plaintiffs filed their initial Complaint on March 15, 2023.  Plaintiffs filed the operative FAC on October
12, 2023, alleging four causes of action against Moving Defendant and
Non-moving Defendants Exodus Recovery, Inc. (“Exodus Inc.”), Exodus Foundation
dba Exodus Foundation for Recovery (“Exodus Foundation”), Pathways Medical
Association (“Pathways”), Todd Nathan, N.P. (“Nathan”), and Luana Murphy
(“Murphy”) (collectively, “Defendants”): (1) Unruh Civil Rights Act [against
Exodus Inc., Exodus Foundation, and Pathways]; (2) Violation of Elder Abuse
and Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act (Welf. & Inst. Code §§15610.05,
15610.07, 15610.57) [against all Defendants]; (3) Professional
Negligence (Medical Malpractice) [against all Defendants]; and (4) Wrongful
Death [against all Defendants].
Moving Defendant filed the instant motion on July 12,
2024.  Plaintiffs filed their opposition
on September 19, 2024.  Plaintiffs filed
a notice of errata and an amended opposition on September 20, 2024.  Moving Defendant filed his reply on September
30, 2024.
 
Legal
Standard
A
motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that
there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.  (C.C.P. §437c(c).) 
A
motion for summary adjudication may be made by itself or as an alternative to a
motion for summary judgment and shall proceed in all procedural respects as a
motion for summary judgment.  (C.C.P. §437c(f)(2).)  A party may move
for summary adjudication as to one or more causes of action within an action if
that party contends that the cause of action has no merit or to an affirmative
defense as to any cause of action, that there is no merit to a claim for
damages, as specified in Civil Code §3294, or that one or more defendants
either owed or did not owe a duty to the plaintiff or plaintiffs.  (C.C.P. §437c(f)(1).)  A motion for summary adjudication shall be
granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of action, an affirmative
defense, a claim for damages, or an issue of duty.  (C.C.P.
§437c(f)(1).) 
 
Violation of the Elder Abuse and
Dependent Adult Civil Protection Act (2nd COA)
“Abuse
of an elder or a dependent adult” means “[p]hysical abuse, neglect,
abandonment, isolation, abduction, or other treatment with resulting physical
harm or pain or mental suffering” or “[t]he deprivation by a care custodian of
goods or services that are necessary to avoid physical harm or mental
suffering.”  (Welf. & Inst. Code
§15610.07(a).)  
In
order to state a cause of action for neglect under the Elder Abuse and
Dependent Adult Act, Plaintiffs must allege: (1) Decedent was an elder or
dependent adult; (2) defendant had responsibility for meeting the basic needs
of the elder or dependent adult, such as nutrition, hydration, hygiene or
medical care; (3) defendant knew of conditions that made the elder or dependent
adult unable to provide for his or her own basic needs; (4) defendant denied or
withheld goods or services necessary to meet the elder or dependent adult’s
basic needs, (a) either with knowledge that injury was substantially certain to
befall the elder or dependent adult (if the plaintiff alleges oppression, fraud
or malice); or (b) with conscious disregard of the high probability of such
injury (if the plaintiff alleges recklessness); and (5) the neglect caused the
elder or dependent adult to suffer physical harm, pain or mental suffering.  (Carter v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley
LLC (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 396, 406-407.)  
Neglect
has two definitions under the Welfare and Institutions Code: “(1) The negligent
failure of any person having the care or custody of an elder or a dependent
adult to exercise that degree of care that a reasonable person in a like
position would exercise [or] (2) The negligent failure of an elder or dependent
adult to exercise that degree of self-care that a reasonable person in a like
position would exercise.”  (Welf. &
Inst. Code §§15610.57(a)(1)-(2).)  Neglect
further includes but is not limited to: “(2) Failure to provide medical care
for physical and mental health needs. . .. (3) Failure to protect from health
and safety hazards.”  (Welf. & Inst.
Code §§15610.57(b)(2)-(3).)
“It
must be determined, on a case-by-case basis, whether the specific
responsibilities assumed by a defendant were sufficient to give rise to a
substantial caretaking or custodial relationship. The fact that [another
caregiver] provided for a large number of decedent’s basic needs does not, in
itself, serve to insulate defendants from liability under the Elder Abuse Act
if the services they provided were sufficient to give rise to a substantial
caretaking or custodial relationship.”  (Oroville
Hospital v. Superior Court (2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 382, 405.)
Moving
Defendant argues Decedent relied on Exodus and Moving Defendant the way a
person would rely on an urgent care center for medical services and
psychiatrist as a medical provider as a result of suicidal ideations and being
a danger to self, not as a custodial caregiver attending to basic needs that an
able-bodied adult could manage without assistance.  (Motion, pg. 22.)  Moving Defendant argues Plaintiffs’
allegations pertain to the provision of medical services, the sort of conduct triggering
more conventional tort liability for medical negligence not one for dependent
adult abuse.  (Winn, 63 Cal.4th at pg. 159.)
Moving
Defendant submitted evidence that Decedent was not deprived of access to
medical services in this case, but rather, Decedent was properly monitored and
continuously received medical services from Exodus staff and Moving Defendant.  Specifically, Moving Defendant submitted
expert testimony stating Moving Defendant’s treatment of Decedent met the
standard of care, and Moving Defendant’s evaluation, assessment, and treatment of
Decedent were not custodial services that an untrained layperson would provide
to a dependent adult or elderly person but were appropriate medical
interventions.  (Defendant’s Disputed
Separate Statement of Fact [“D-DSSF”] 72, 73; Decl. of Braff ¶¶36, 44-46, 48-50.)  Moving Defendant met its burden to
demonstrate the specific responsibilities assumed by a defendant were
not sufficient to give rise to a substantial caretaking or custodial
relationship.  Moving Defendant shifts
the burden to Plaintiffs to raise a triable issue of material fact exists as to
whether Moving Defendant undertook a substantial caretaking or custodial
relationship.
Plaintiffs
met their burden to raise a triable issue of material fact as to whether Moving
Defendant undertook a substantial caretaking or custodial relationship of
Decedent.  Specifically, Plaintiffs
submitted expert testimony that Decedent was not able to conduct his activities
of daily living, such as medical assistance, self-preservation, dressing,
getting in and out of bed or a chair, walking, using the toilet, and eating by
himself, and Decedent was wholly dependent on Defendants for medical, psychiatric,
and psychological care.  (Plaintiffs’
Additional Material Fact [“P-AMF”] 66, 69; Decl. of Rudnik ¶39.)  Plaintiffs also submitted evidence that Moving
Defendant breached the standard of care by failing to conduct a suicidal
assessment prior to discharging Decedent. 
(P-AMF 81; Decl. of Rudnik ¶52.) 
Accordingly, Plaintiffs met their burden to raise a triable issue of
material fact as to whether Moving Defendant undertook a substantial caretaking
or custodial relationship of Decedent.
Accordingly,
Moving Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication of the 2nd cause of action
is denied.
 
Punitive Damages (2nd COA)
To recover punitive damages, a plaintiff must
prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of
oppression, fraud, or malice.  (Civ. Code
§3294(a).)  
Moving Defendant argues there are no triable
issues relating to the cause of action for dependent adult abuse and therefore
there can be no corresponding claim for punitive damages.  (Motion, pg. 28.)
For the same reasons stated with regard to
Moving Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication as to the 2nd cause of
action, Moving Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication of the claim for
punitive damages is denied.
Accordingly,
Moving Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication of Plaintiffs’ claim for
punitive damages is denied.
 
Conclusion
Moving
Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is denied. 
Moving
Defendant’s motion in the alternative for summary adjudication of Plaintiffs’
2nd cause of action and claim for punitive damages is denied.
Moving
Party to give notice.

Association’s and Todd Nathan N.P.’s MSJ
 
Defendants
Exodus Recovery Inc. (“Exodus Inc.”), Exodus Foundation (“Exodus Foundation”),
and Luana Murphy (“Murphy”) (“Exodus Defendants”) move for summary judgment of Plaintiffs’
FAC on the grounds that all of Plaintiffs’ claims are time-barred by the
applicable statutes of limitation and that no grounds for tolling those
statutes of limitation exist.  (Notice

Defendants
Pathways Medical Association (“Pathways”) and Todd Nathan, N.P. (“Nathan”)
(collectively, “Joining Defendants”) join Exodus Defendants’ motion for summary
judgment.  (Notice Motion Joinder, pg.
2.)

CRC
Violation
CRC Rule 3.1350(d) provides:
(2)     
The Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in support of a
motion must separately
identify: 
(A)       
Each cause of action, claim for damages, issue of duty, or affirmative defense that is the
subject of the motion; and 
(B)       
Each supporting material fact claimed to be without dispute with
respect to the cause of action, claim for damages, issue of duty, or
affirmative defense that is the subject of the motion. 
 
(CRC, Rule 3.1350(d), emphasis
added.)
Exodus Defendants’ and Joining
Defendants’ separate statements are in violation of CRC, Rule 3.1350(d).  Exodus Defendants’ and Joining Defendants’
separate statements fail to separately set out each cause of action that is
subject of Defendants’ motions.  (CRC,
Rule 3.1350(d)(1)(A).)  
 
Background
Exodus Defendants filed the instant motion on July 12,
2024.  Joining Defendants filed their
joinder to Exodus Defendants’ motion on July 15, 2024.  Plaintiffs filed their opposition on
September 30, 2024.  Exodus Defendants
filed their reply on October 3, 2024.
 
Entire Complaint
In
any action where the district court has original jurisdiction, the district
court also has supplemental jurisdiction over all related claims that form part
of the same case or controversy.  (28
U.S.C. §1367(a).) However, the district court may decline to exercise
supplemental jurisdiction over related claims if the district court has
dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.  (28 U.S.C. §1367(c)(3).)  In those instances, the statute of limitations
for any supplemental claims that are voluntarily dismissed shall be tolled
while the claim is pending, and for a period of thirty (30) days after it is
dismissed.  (28 U.S.C.
§1367(d), emphasis added.)  Further, if a
plaintiff files an amended complaint that omits all federal law claims, it
divests the federal court of subject matter jurisdiction.  (Scott v. Pasadena Unified School District
(9th Cir. 2002) 306 F.3d 646, 664.)  Therefore,
under such circumstances, the court has no supplemental jurisdiction over the
remaining state law claims and must dismiss those state law claims without
prejudice.  (Id.) 
Here,
the district court had original jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ two federal law
causes of action alleged in its March 14, 2022, Complaint for Damages, for
Violation of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Violation of
Section 504 of the rehabilitation Act.  (P-AMF
15.)  By virtue of Plaintiffs’ other six
causes of action forming part of the same case of controversy—the wrongful
conduct of Defendants against Decedent during his stay at Eastside UCC, from
November 23, 2020, through November 24, 2020—the district court had
supplemental jurisdiction over these causes of action.  Plaintiff filed an amended complaint in the
District Court that omitted all federal law claims, which operated to divest
the federal court of subject matter jurisdiction.  (Scott, 306 F.3d at pg. 664; P-AMF 18.)
 Further, Defendants concede that
Plaintiffs voluntarily filed a motion asking the USDC to not exercise
supplemental jurisdiction over their state law claims.  (P-AMF 19.)  The district court then granted Plaintiffs’
request and voluntarily dismissed Plaintiff’s state law claims without
prejudice on February 17, 2023.  (P-AMF 21.)
The District Court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over
Plaintiffs’ remaining state law causes of action and dismissed Plaintiffs’ SAC
without prejudice “to allow Plaintiffs, if they choose, to re-file their state
law causes of action in state court.” (P-AMF 21.)  In its February 17, 2023, Order, the
Honorable Sherilyn Peace Garnett wrote, “[g]iven that this Court has dismissed
Plaintiff’s federal claims with prejudice, that this case is in the initial
stages of litigation, and that it does not appear Plaintiffs are precluded from
bringing their state law claims in state court, the Court finds the values of
judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity weigh in favor of
dismissing the state law claims in the SAC without prejudice in order for
Plaintiff to bring those claims in state court.”  (P-AMF 22.)  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1367(a), after the
district court dismissed Plaintiff’s SAC on February 17, 2023, the statutes of
limitations over all of Plaintiffs’ state law claims were tolled for a period
of thirty (30) days, to March 19, 2023. 
(P-AMF 21-22.) 
On
March 15, 2023, within thirty (30) days of when the district court dismissed
Plaintiffs’ SAC, Plaintiffs filed an initial complaint for damages in this
Court, alleging violations of the same state law claims that the district court
voluntarily dismissed without prejudice.  (P-AMF 23.)  Plaintiffs filed their initial complaint in
this Court within thirty days of when the district court voluntarily dismissed
their state law claims.  Plaintiffs’
initial Complaint in this Court was filed within the applicable statute of
limitations established by 28 U.S.C. §1367(a). 
Therefore, Plaintiffs’ claims are not barred. 
Plaintiffs
did not require consent from the Defendants to re-file their claims in this
Court, nor did they require Defendants’ consent to waive any applicable statues
of limitations, as Defendants state, as Plaintiffs’ claims were automatically
tolled by 28 U.S.C. §1367(a).
The
statute of limitations ordinarily commences when a cause of action accrues.  (Bernson v. Browning-Ferris Industries
(1994) 7 Cal.4th 926, 931.)  Accrual
generally occurs on the date of injury.  (Id.)  An alternative view is that the statute of
limitations commences “‘upon the occurrence of the last element to the cause of
action.’”  (Id.)  The common law discovery rule has
significantly modified these general principles.  (Id.) 
According to the discovery rule, the accrual date may be “delayed until
the plaintiff is aware of her injury and its negligent cause.”  (Id.) 
A “cause of action under the discovery rule accrues when the plaintiff
discovers or  should have discovered all
facts essential to his cause of action . . . ; this has been interpreted under  the discovery rule to be when plaintiff either
(1) actually discovered his injury and its negligent cause or (2) could have
discovered injury and cause through the exercise of reasonable diligence.”  (April Enterprises, Inc. v. KTTV (1983)
147 Cal.App.3d 805, 826.)
The discovery rule “avoids dismissing a suit
on grounds of limitation when a plaintiff is blamelessly ignorant of his cause
of action.”  (April, 147 Cal.App.3d at pgs.
826-827.)  Application of the discovery
rule “is particularly appropriate when the defendant maintains custody and
control of a plaintiff’s property or interests.”  (Id. at pg. 827.)
Here, application of the discovery rule is appropriate
because Defendants maintained
custody and control of Plaintiffs’ property (i.e., Decedent’s medical
records).  (Id. at pg. 831.)  Indeed, both the Honorable Mark H. Epstein,
and Exodus’ PMK agreed that Decedent’s parents were entitled to the records,
thus it was effectively their property.  (P-AMF 12, 25.)  Exodus maintained custody and control of
Plaintiff’s property, as the documents were accessible in a room on the second
floor of the Eastside UCC facility and were only given to Plaintiffs after
being compelled by court order.  (P-AMF 11;
Decl. of Henriks, Exh. 9 at pg. 129:16-18.)  Accordingly, the discovery rule applies in
this case because Exodus Defendants deliberately refused to produce Decedent’s
medical records on six different occasions.  (P-AMF Nos. 1-7, 10.)
Defendant’s statute of limitations defense
rests on the assumption that the one-year statute of limitations, if
applicable, began running on November 24, 2020, the day the Decedent died.  Per C.C.P. §340.5, the time for commencement
of an action against a healthcare provider for death is one year after the
Plaintiff discovers, or through reasonable diligence should have discovered the
injury. However, resolution of statute of limitations issues, such as when a
plaintiff discovers, or should have discovered their injury, is normally a
question of fact for the jury.  (Deveny v. Entropin (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 408, 419.)  It is only where uncontradicted facts
established through discovery are susceptible to only one legitimate inference
that summary judgment is proper.  (Id.)
 More importantly, “whether the plaintiff
exercised reasonable diligence is a question of fact for the court or jury to
decide.”  (April, 147 Cal.App.3d
at pg. 833.) 
Here, Plaintiffs exercised reasonable
diligence by requesting the medical records on five separate occasions and
filing a Petition to Access Medical Records with the court.  (P-AMF  1,
2-8.)  Nonetheless, the jury has the
right to decide whether Plaintiffs did indeed exercise reasonable by these
actions.  (April, 147 Cal. App.3d
at pg. 833.)
Further, the gravamen of Plaintiffs’
Complaint is Dependent Adult Abuse. 
Therefore, the statute of limitations period is two years.
Accordingly, Exodus Defendants’ and Joining
Defendants’ motion for summary judgment is denied.
 
Conclusion
Exodus
Defendants’ and Joining Defendants’ motion for summary judgment is denied.
