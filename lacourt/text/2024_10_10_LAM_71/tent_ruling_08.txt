COUNTY

  23STCV15747
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  October 10, 2024



 
Plaintiff Renard
Louis’ motion for leave to file a first amended complaint is granted.  Plaintiff may file the proposed first amended
complaint with the Court.
 
          Plaintiff Renard
Louis (“Louis”) (“Plaintiff”) moves for an order granting leave to file a
first amended complaint (“FAC”) on the basis the proposed FAC adds new
allegations to existing causes of action and a new cause of action for
violation of Labor Code §1102.5.  (Notice
of Motion, pgs. 1, 12; C.C.P. §473(a)(1).)
          
          Procedural
Background
          Plaintiff
filed his initial Complaint on July 6, 2023, alleging nine causes of action
against Defendant County of Los Angeles (“County”) (“Defendant”): (1)
discrimination on the basis of race (Gov. Code §12940(a)); (2) discrimination
on the basis of marital status (Gov. Code §12940(a)); (3) discrimination on the
basis of disability (Gov. Code §12940(a)); (4) failure to reasonably
accommodate (Gov. Code §12940(m)); (5) failure to engage in the interactive
process (Gov. Code §12940(n)); (6) violation of the California Family Rights
Act (Gov. Code §§12945.2 et seq.); (7) harassment (Gov. Code §12940(j)); (8)
failure to prevent discrimination/harassment (Gov. Code §12940(i)); and (9)
retaliation (Gov. Code §12940(h)).  (See
Complaint.)
          Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on July 3, 2024. 
Defendant filed its opposition on September 30, 2024.  Plaintiff filed his reply on October 3, 2024.
 
          Motion for Leave to Amend
“The
court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow
a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name
of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake
in any other respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or
demurrer. The court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the
adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any
pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms allow an
answer to be made after the time limited by this code.”  (C.C.P.
§473(a)(1).) 
“Trial
courts are vested with the discretion to allow amendments to pleadings ‘in
furtherance of justice.’ That trial courts are to liberally permit such
amendments, at any stage of the proceeding, has been established policy in this
state since 1901.”  (Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d
486, 488-489.) 
CRC
Rule 3.1321(a) requires that a motion to amend must: “[i]nclude a copy of the
proposed . . . amended pleading . . . [and] state what allegations in the
previous pleading are proposed to be [deleted and/or added], if any, and where,
by page, paragraph, and line number, the [deleted and/or additional]
allegations are located.” 
CRC
Rule 3.1324(b) provides, as follows: “[a] separate declaration must accompany
the motion and must specify: (1) [t]he effect of the amendment; (2) [w]hy the
amendment is necessary and proper; (3) [w]hen the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered; and (4) [t]he reasons why the request for
amendment was not made earlier.” 
Plaintiff’s
motion substantially complies with CRC Rule 3.1324(a).  The motion
includes a copy of the proposed FAC.  (Notice of Lodging Proposed FAC,
Exh. A.)   Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration sets forth
the allegations proposed to be added and deleted, and where, by page,
paragraph, and line number.  (Decl. of Edwards ¶¶13, 15, Exh. 10.) 
Plaintiff’s
motion substantially complies with CRC Rule 3.1324(b).  Plaintiff submitted a separate declaration of
his counsel that specifies the effect of the amendments and explains why the
amendments are necessary and proper.  (Decl. of Edwards ¶¶17-20.)  Plaintiff
asserts the substantive amendments are necessary because they disclose further
acts of retaliation, which were unknown at the time the initial Complaint was
filed.  (Decl. of Edwards ¶¶19(A)-(B).)
Plaintiff’s
counsel states when the facts giving rise to substantive amended allegations
were discovered and why the request for amendment was not made earlier.  Plaintiff’s counsel declares, “[t]he
additional adverse employment actions mentioned above did not occur until
January 2024. On or about January 26, 2024, the County informed Plaintiff that
his Long-term disability claim had been denied. . . . Consequently, on January
31, 2024, Plaintiff submitted his notice of retirement.”  (Decl. of Edwards ¶19(B).)  
Plaintiff’s
counsel declares, “Plaintiff could not have amended the Complaint prior to the
accrual of the Whistleblower cause of action and the completion of the
exhaustion of his administrative remedies pursuant to California Government
Code Section 910.”  (Decl. of Edwards
¶24.)  Plaintiff’s counsel further
declares, “the proposed amendments were not made earlier due to Plaintiff’s and
my unavailability. At the time Plaintiff was forced to retire, his current medical
condition became exacerbated, and he was unavailable for a period of time, thereafter.
During this same period, my father (who had resided with me for the past 10 years)
required extra attentive home medical care. Sadly, in mid-January 2024 my
father passed away. As the executor of my father’s estate, I was required to
organize, orchestrate and execute all undertakings for my late father and
memorial activities in Southern California and in February 2024, memorial
activities and burial in New York. Upon my return to California, I had to
reengage with my cases, address the affairs of my late father, and grapple with
the grief of losing a parent. [¶] In early March 2024, I began transitioning
full-time back into the office. Immediately, I had to prepare for the
deposition of Plaintiff’s supervisor, Jimmy Tsai, whose deposition proceeded on
March 18, 2024. Jimmy Tsai’s deposition was concluded on May 7, 2025, during a
second session. Based on information, Plaintiff’s counsel received from the
first session of Jimmy Tsai’s deposition testimony, Plaintiff’s counsel began
assessing the tasks and timing to research, compose and finalize the contents
of a Government Tort Claim for a Whistle Blower claim, which included
conversations with Plaintiff.”  (Decl. of
Edwards ¶25.)
Defendant’s
argument that Plaintiff’s proposed amendment should be denied on the basis
Plaintiff unreasonably delayed in bringing the motion is unavailing.  The policy favoring amendment is so strong
that denial of leave to amend can rarely be justified: “If the motion to amend
is timely made and the granting of the motion will not prejudice the opposing
party, it is error to refuse permission to amend and where the refusal also
results in a party being deprived of the right to assert a meritorious cause of
action or a meritorious defense, it is not only error but an abuse of
discretion.”  (Morgan v. Superior Court
(1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.) 
Defendant argues it would be prejudiced by the Court granting the
instant motion because “it would allow Plaintiff to avoid compliance with the
Government Tort Claims Act, which bars Plaintiff’s suit.”  (Opposition, pg. 6.)  Defendant’s argument is not well taken.  Asserting a claim against a Defendant is not
grounds for prejudice; rather, it is the standard procedure to present
grievances to the judiciary.
Prejudice
exists where the amendment would result in a delay of trial, along with loss of
critical evidence, added costs of preparation, increased burden of discovery,
etc.  (Magpali v. Farmers Group, Inc.
(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488; see P & D Consultants, Inc. v. City
of Carlsbad (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1345; Fisher v. Larsen
(1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 627, 649, [leave to amend properly denied where P knew
for over five months claims had not been properly pleaded and took no action to
amend until after summary judgment granted against it].)
It
is improper for this Court to consider the validity of the proposed amended
pleading on the instant motion; after leave to amend is granted, Defendant will
have the opportunity to attack the validity of the amended pleading.  (See Kittredge
Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045,
1048; Atkinson v. Elk Corp.
(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 760 [“[T]he better course of action would have been
to allow [plaintiff] to amend the complaint and then let the parties test its
legal sufficiency in other appropriate proceedings”].)
Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend his Complaint and file
the proposed FAC is granted.  
 
          Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motion for leave to amend his Complaint is granted.  Plaintiff is ordered to file the proposed FAC
with the Court within 10 days.
          Moving Party to give notice.
