 Case Number:  23STCV08370    Hearing Date:   October 10, 2024    Dept:  71 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles   DEPARTMENT  71   TENTATIVE RULING      SANTOS GOMEZ,    et al.              vs.   CLEMENTE    BARCENAS.    Case No.:  23STCV08370        Hearing    Date:  October 10, 2024      Petitioner Susana Patricia Orduna’s petition to approve minor’s  compromise for Marla Maylin Orduna is granted.   The Court orders the check in the sum of $5,000.00 paid to Petitioner  Susana Patricia Orduna, the minor Marla Maylin Orduna’s mother, pursuant to  Probate Code §§3401 and 3402.      Petitioner Susana Patricia Orduna (“Orduna”), on behalf of  Claimant Marla Maylin Orduna (“Marla”), petitions this Court to approve minor’s  compromise in the settlement of the instant action.     I.                    Background Orduna, individually and as guardian ad litem for Marla together  with other named Plaintiffs (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed the operative Complaint  against Defendant Clemente Barcenas (“Barcenas”) (“Defendant”) on April 14,  2023, for (1) negligence, (2) breach of implied warranty of habitability, (3)  violation of Civil Code §1942.4, and (4) breach of Los Angeles Municipal Code  §45.33 for issues at a property  located at 202 E 78th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90003 (“Property”), owned by  Defendant, where Plaintiffs were tenants.  (See Complaint ¶¶1, 5-6.)  Pursuant  to the instant petition, Defendant has agreed to pay Plaintiffs to settle the  claims.  (Petition ¶¶10, 11.)   A settlement was reached pursuant to which Defendant agreed to pay  a total of $70,000.00.  (Petition at Attach. 11(b)(3)-(6).)  Marla, the one settling minor claimant will  receive a gross sum of $5,000.00.  (Petition at Attach. 11 §3.)  No attorneys’ fees or costs will be deducted  from the minor claimant’s settlement.  (Petition  Attach. 18(b)(5), Decl. of Orduna ¶4.)  The net balance of proceeds for the minor  claimant is $5,000.  (Petition ¶¶15,  16(f).)  All procedural requirements have  been met, as Petitioner has completed a Judicial Council form MC-350 on behalf  of the minor claimant, signed by the Petitioner, as well as Form MC-351 on the  minor claimant’s behalf.     II.                 Legal Standard Compromises of disputed claims brought by minors are governed in  part by C.C.P. §372.  The statute allows  a guardian ad litem to appear in court on behalf of a minor claimant and gives  the guardian ad litem the power to compromise the minor’s claim “with the  approval of the court in which the action or proceeding is pending.”  A petition for court approval of a compromise  must be verified by the petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all  information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise or  covenant.  (CRC Rule 7.950.)  CRC Rule 7.952(a) requires the attendance of  the petitioner and claimant at the hearing on the compromise of the claim  unless the court for good causes dispenses with their personal appearance. “Neither section 372 nor the California Rules of Court (rules  7.950 & 7.952) contemplates a noticed motion and adversary hearing when  court approval of a minor’s compromise is sought. Although we need not decide  the question, it would appear that a petition to approve or disapprove a  minor’s compromise may be decided by the superior court, ex parte, in  chambers.”  (Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1337.)     III.               Analysis Petitioner seeks court approval for a settlement under which the  minor claimant would receive $5,000.  The  amounts reflect the net payment amount to the minor claimant.  (See Petition ¶16(f).)   This is a habitability suit in which the minor claimant lived in  uninhabitable conditions, including but not limited to living with an insect  infestation wherein the minor claimant suffered spider bites requiring medical  treatment.  (Petition ¶¶5-7.)  The minor claimant has recovered completely  from these injuries with no permanent injuries.   (Petition ¶8.)   Petitioner requests this Court order the disposition of the minor  claimant’s balance of the settlement, in the amount of $5,000.00, be paid or  delivered to her, the minor’s parent, without bond, on the terms and under the  conditions specified in Probate Code §§3401-3402.  (Petition ¶18(b)(5).) Given the age of the minor claimant, the Court will only require  attendance at the hearing by the Petitioner to grant the petition.  (CRC Rule 7.952.)   IV.             Conclusion Based on the foregoing, the petition to approve the minor’s  compromise is granted.  The Court orders  the funds paid or delivered to Petitioner Orduna, the minor’s parent, without  bond, on the terms and under the conditions specified in Probate Code  §§3401-3402.
