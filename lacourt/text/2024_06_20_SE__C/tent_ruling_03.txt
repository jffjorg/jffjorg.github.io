TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant Los
Angeles Unified School District’s Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Adjudication is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN
PART. 
 
Plaintiffs to give
notice. 
 
 
Edilberto Garcia, a Foklorio
dance teacher, is alleged to have sexually assaulted students at Gage Middle
School in the mid-1980s. In the operative First Amended Complaint filed on May
18, 2021, Plaintiffs John G.Z. Doe #1 and John R.Z. Doe #2 (“Plaintiffs”) sue Defendant
Los Angeles Unified School District (“LAUSD”) for 2) sexual harassment (Civ.
Code, §§ 51.9 and 52); 3) negligent hiring,
supervision, and retention; 4) failure to report suspected child abuse; 5) negligent
failure to warn, train, or educate; and 6) negligent supervision of a minor.
 
LAUSD seeks summary
judgment and, in the alternative, summary adjudication. 
 
Requests for Judicial Notice
 
Plaintiffs request judicial notice of the

of Assem. Bill No. 218 (2019-2020 Reg. Sess.) as introduced January 16, 2019.
 
The court will
take judicial notice of the legislative history of a statute to ascertain the
purpose of and meaning of an ambiguous statute. (Quelimane Co., Inc. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 45, fn. 9.) 
 
Thus, the Court
grants the requests. 
 
Separate
Statement
 
The supporting papers shall include a separate statement
setting forth plainly and concisely all material facts that the moving party
contends are undisputed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(b)(1).) Each of the material facts stated shall be followed by a reference to
the supporting evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(b)(1).) The failure to comply with this requirement of a separate statement
may in the court's discretion constitute sufficient grounds for denying the
motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(b)(1).)
 
What witnesses
said are not “material facts” as that term is used in the summary judgment
statute. (Reeves v. Safeway Stores, Inc. (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 95, 106.)
Material facts need to be stated as facts, rather than stating what
witnesses said about the events. (Ibid.) 
 
Here, many of the facts
in the separate statement are stated as what witnesses said about the events.
For example, fact number 36 states, “G.Z. testified that no inappropriate
interactions with Garcia occurred on campus.” As the Court stated in its May
29, 2024, order, the Court will strike these prefatory words.
 
Evidentiary
Objections
 
LAUSD submitted evidentiary objections as part of its reply
papers. 
 
In granting or denying a motion for summary judgment or
summary adjudication, the court needs rule only on those objections to evidence
that it deems material to its disposition of the motion. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (q).)
 
After reviewing LAUSD’s evidentiary objections, the Court finds
that they are not material to the disposition of the motion and will not rule
on them. 
 
Legal Standard
 
“[A] motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers
submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)  The moving
party bears the initial burden of production to make a prima facie
showing no triable material fact exists. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850.) If the moving party meets this burden, the burden
shifts to the opposing party to make a converse prima facie showing that
a triable issue of material fact exists. (Ibid.)  
 
Discussion 
 
As a preliminary matter, a judge may
permit a defendant to raise an affirmative defense for the first time in its
summary judgment motion absent a showing of prejudice to the plaintiff. (Nieto
v. Blue Shield of Cal. Life & Health Ins. Co. (2010) 181
Cal.App.4th 60, 75.) Here, LAUSD raises the statute of limitations defense; argues
Article XVI, Section 6 of
California Constitution as a defense; and argues Education Code section 44808
as a defense for the first time in the instant motion. Given that Plaintiffs
have opposed the arguments on their merits, the Court finds no showing of
prejudice. 
 
Thus, the Court
permits LAUSD to raise these affirmative defenses.  
 
All Causes of Action – Statute of Limitations 
 
LAUSD argues that the
statute of limitations bars Plaintiffs’ causes of action. Under the applicable
statute of limitations, Plaintiff must be no more than 40 years old when filing
a complaint or Plaintiff must file five years following the discovery of a
psychological injury, whichever occurs later. (Code Civ. Proc., § 340.1, subd (a).) LAUSD argues that both
Plaintiffs discovered the psychological injury from the perpetrator’s conduct
outside the five-year window permitted to sue. Thus, the entire suit is barred.

 
LAUSD’s argument
relies on the incorrect law. According to the current version of the statute, for
childhood sexual assault that allegedly occurred on or before December 31,
2023, the law in effect on December 31, 2023, still applies. (Code Civ. Proc., § 340.1, subd. (p).) On December 31, 2023, a
revival provision was in effect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 340.1, former subd. (q).) It revived any claim
that “has not been litigated to finality and that would otherwise be barred as
of January 1, 2020.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 340.1, former subd. (q).) They may be commenced within three years of
January 1, 2020. (Code Civ. Proc., § 340.1,
former subd. (q).) 
 
Because LAUSD
applied the incorrect law, it did not meet its burden to show that no triable
issue of material fact exists. The burden does not shift to the opposing party.

 
All Causes of Action – Article XVI, Section 6
of California Constitution 
 
LAUSD also argues
that the retroactive application of AB 218 violates Article XVI, Section 6 of
the California Constitution. The provision states, “the legislature has no
power to give or lend, or to authorize the giving or lending…in any manner
whatever, for the payment of liability of any individual, association,
municipal or other corporation whatever; nor shall it have the power to make
any gift or authorize the making of any gift, of any public money.” LAUSD
argues that AB 218 unlawfully revived claims that had been barred by the
statute of limitations; (2) AB 218 unlawfully removed a substantive element of
the Plaintiffs’ cause of action, i.e. presentation of government tort claims. LAUSD
further argues that the legislature has no power to create a liability against
the state for any past act of negligence. 
 
In Chapman v.
State (1894) 104 Cal. 690, the California Supreme Court addressed the
constitutionality of bringing lawsuits based on acts of negligence that were
once barred. In Chapman, the plaintiff filed a claim with the board of harbor
commissioners, which denied it. (104 Cal. at 692.) Two years later, the state allowed
the claims that the board had rejected to be brought against the state in
court. (104 Cal. at 693.) As the court reasoned, in passing legislation that
allowed the rejected claims to be brought against the state, the legislature
did not create any liability or cause of action against the state where none
existed before, but rather gave one more remedy for enforcing liability. (Id.
at 696.) Similarly, here, in reviving claims that the statute of limitations
barred and removing the requirement to present a government tort claim, the
legislature did not create liability, but removed a barrier to enforce
liability. 
 
The Court determines that LAUSD has not met its burden to show that there
is no triable issue of material fact with respect to the application of Article XVI, Section 6 of California
Constitution. The burden does not shift to the opposing party. 
 
All Causes of Action – Education Code section 44808 
 
LAUSD argues that Education
Code section 44808 precludes liability because all alleged wrongdoing occurred
off campus. 
 
Education Code
section 44808 states, “…[N]o school district…shall be responsible or in any way liable for the conduct
or safety of any pupil of the public schools at any time when such pupil is not
on school property, unless such district… has undertaken to provide
transportation for such pupil to and from the school premises, has undertaken a
school-sponsored activity off the premises of such school, has otherwise
specifically assumed such responsibility or liability or has failed to exercise
reasonable care under the circumstances.” 
 
Here, LAUSD
submits evidence that the underlying allegations of sexual abuse occurred off
campus, and that no inappropriate interactions with Garcia occurred on campus. (UMF
Nos. 34-38, 97-102.)  Therefore, LAUSD
has made a prima facie showing that there are no triable issues of material
fact with respect to the application of Education Code section 44808.  
 
The burden now shifts
to Plaintiffs to raise a triable issue of material fact.
 
Plaintiffs argue
that Section 44808 does not immunize LAUSD from liability for off campus abuse
because both Plaintiffs were abused by Garcia during school hours at least once,
after Gage employees allowed Garcia to take them out of class and to his
apartment where the abuse occurred.  
 
Plaintiffs present
evidence that R. Z. was first abused by Garcia during his 6th period dance
class, after Garcia told Mr. Barcelo and Ms. Cortes that he was going to take
R.Z. off the school campus to Garcia’s apartment to “help” Garcia with moving
costumes. At Garcia’s apartment, Garcia took R. Z.’s penis out of R.Z.’s pants,
put it in his mouth, and began orally copulating R.Z. R.Z. became scared and
left Garcia’s apartment. (AF No. 28.)  When
G.Z. was in 8th grade during the 1985/1986 school year, Garcia took G. Z. out
of his 4th period math class – with permission from G.Z.’s math teacher – and
took G.Z. to his apartment. There, while G. Z. was on the phone with his
girlfriend, Garcia took G.Z.’s penis out of his pants and began orally
copulating him. (AF No. 31.) 
 
Plaintiffs also
argue that LAUSD was negligent in permitting Garcia to develop inappropriate
relationships with Plaintiffs, groom them, and invite them over to his apartment.  Thus, LAUSD’s negligence can be traced back
to its failure to properly supervise Plaintiffs and Garcia while they were on
campus.  The fact that the sexual abuse
culminated off campus does not immunize LAUSD from its negligence while
Plaintiffs were on school premises. (Hoyem v. Manhattan Beach City Sch.
Dist. (1978) 22 Cal.3d 508, 515-516.) Plaintiffs present evidence that Gage
employees knew of should have known that Garcia was developing inappropriate
relationships with his students and failed to act:
 
·       No Gage employee ever stopped the
kids and asked questions about where they were going with Garcia. (AF No. 15), 
·       Cortez (teacher’s assistant) and
Barcelo (instructor) knew that Garcia had Folklorico students come over to hang
at his apartment and spend the night. (AF No. 16)
·       Cortes was frequently present at
Garcia’s apartment when he had students over, and sometimes even walked with
students from school to the apartment. (AF No. 17). 
·       Barcelo, and other employees, saw
students walk with Garcia to his apartment. (AF No. 18)
·       Barcelo also overheard students
remarking that they hung out at Garcia’s house. (AF No. 19.)
·       Everyone at school, including Cortes
and Barcelo, knew that Bernie was living with Garcia. Cortes knew because she
spent time at Garcia’s house with the students, and Barcelo knew because
everyone spoke about it in front of him. (AF No. 22.)
·       Garcia frequently came to school and
left with Bernie. (AF No. 23.)
·       No one from Gage or the District
ever asked Bernie any questions about his living with Garcia. (AF No. 24.)
·       At one point, parents expressed
concern that there was inadequate supervision over the Folklorico class. In
response, Barcelo met with parents and students to reassure them that he “had
everything under control” and that there was “proper supervision.” (AF No. 26.)
 
In reply, LAUSD
acknowledges that under Education Code section 44808, LAUSD “could not be
liable for injuries off campus and after school hours unless they were a result
of the district’s’ negligence occurring on school grounds or were the
result of some specific undertaking by the District, which was then performed
in a negligent manner.” (Mosley v. San Bernardino City Unified School
District (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1264 (italics added).) 
 
The Court determines that Plaintiffs have raised a triable
issue of material fact regarding LAUSD’s negligence on school grounds and the application of
Education Code section 44808 to the circumstances of this case.  

 

Second Cause of Action
 
LAUSD also argues
that Civil Code section 51.9 and 52 do not apply to it because Civil Code
section 51.9 provides a cause of action against a “person,” and Civil Code
section 52, subdivision (b) states, “Whoever denies the right provided by
[Civil Code] Section 51.7 or 51.9, or aids, incites, or conspires in that
denial, is liable for each and every offense for the actual damages suffered by
any person denied that right,” as well as “exemplary damages,” “attorney’s fees
as may be determined by the court,” and, for Civil Code section 51.7, a civil
penalty.” LAUSD asserts that as a public school district, it is not a “person”
under the statute and cites K.M. vs. Grossmont Union High School Dist.
(2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 717, 751-752. Based on the foregoing, LAUSD has met its
burden. The burden now shifts to Plaintiffs. 
 
Plaintiffs state that
they do not dispute LAUSD’s arguments. 
 
Thus, the Court
grants summary adjudication as to the second cause of action. 
 
Third, Fifth and Sixth Causes of Action
 
As to the these causes
of action, LAUSD argues that it is immune from liability based upon Education
Code section 44808.  For the reasons
discussed above, the Court determines that Plaintiffs have raised a triable
issue of material fact with respect to the application of Education Code
section 44808.  
 
Fourth Cause of Action
 
As to the fourth
cause of action, LAUSD argues that the Child Abuse and Neglect Report Act was
not in effect at the time of the alleged incidents. But it was originally
enacted in 1980 as the Child Abuse Reporting Act, and it required a child care
custodian who “has knowledge of or observes a child in his or her professional
capacity or within the scope of his or her employment whom he or she reasonably
suspects has been the victim of child abuse to report such suspected instance
of child abuse to a child protective agency….” (Stats. 1980, ch. 1071, § 4.) “Child
care custodian” includes a teacher, administrative officer, certificated pupil
personnel employee of a public school headstart teacher, social worker, and
probation officer. (Stats. 1980, ch. 1071, § 4.)
 
The Court determines
that LAUSD has not met its burden to show that no triable issue of material
fact exists. The burden does not shift to the opposing party. 
 
Other Arguments
 
LAUSD also argues
that there is not a causal nexus nor is it foreseeable that the dance teacher
would commit sexual abuse. (Mot., pg. 25.) LAUSD further argues that the
alleged misconduct occurred outside the scope of employment. (Mot, pgs. 25-27,
33.) But Plaintiffs do not
allege that the District was vicariously liable for the sexual abuse by Garcia.
Rather, Plaintiffs allege that the District is vicariously liable for the
negligence of its employees, i.e. teachers and administrators, in failing to
protect Plaintiff from foreseeable sexual abuse by an employee of the District
– Garcia. (FAC, ¶¶ 37, 58.) The pleadings serve as the “outer
measure of materiality” in a summary judgment motion, and the motion may not be
granted or denied on issues not raised by the pleadings. (Laabs v. City of Victorville (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1258.) 
 
Thus, the Court
does not adjudicate these issues. 
 
Accordingly, LAUSD’s
motion for summary judgment is DENIED.  LAUSD’s
motion for summary adjudication as to the second cause of action is GRANTED.  LAUSD’s motion for summary adjudication as to
the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth causes of action is DENIED.
