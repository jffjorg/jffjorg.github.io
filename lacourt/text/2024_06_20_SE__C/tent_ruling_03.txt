In
determining the good faith of a settlement, the Court must balance the public
policy favoring settlements with that favoring equitable sharing of costs among
tortfeasors. To do so, the settlement must be within the reasonable range of
the settling tortfeasor’s share of liability for the Plaintiff’s injuries,
taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the particular case. (Tech-Bilt,
Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, 499.) The Tech-Bilt
court set forth the factors to be considered by the court in making the
determination, such as: (1) the rough approximation of claimant’s total
recovery and the settling parties’ proportional liability; (2) the amount paid
in settlement; (3) the allocation of settlement proceeds among claimants; (4)
recognition that a settling party should pay less in settlement than he would
if he were liable after trial; (5) the settling party’s financial condition;
(6) insurance policy limits of settling respondents; and (7) existence of
collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interest of
non-settling parties. Furthermore, the practical considerations require that
the evaluation be made on the basis of information available at the time of the
settlement. (Id.) In sum, “a defendant’s settlement future must not be
grossly disproportionate to what a reasonable person, at the time of the
settlement, would estimate the settling defendant’s liability be.” (Id.)
Thus, as long as settlement is not so far “out of the ballpark” in relation to
these factors as to be inconsistent with the equitable objectives of CCP
§877.6, the settlement shall be determined as being made in good faith. (Id.
499-500.) 
 
While
a non-settling party bears the ultimate burden of showing that a settlement was
not in good faith, the moving party must make a sufficient showing of all Tech-Bilt
factors, either in the original moving papers, or in counter-declarations filed
after opposition has been filed. (City of Grand Terrace v. Superior Court
(1987) 92 Cal.App.3d 1251, 1262.) 
 
The
parties have been apprised of the settlement terms, and the amount to be paid
in the settlement (a mutual waiver of costs). In cases where liability is
unlikely, like here, a settlement for fees/costs may be in good faith. (Armstrong
World Industries, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 951.) Given the
unopposed statements made in the Declaration of Matthew A. Gardner regarding the
unlikeliness of Spaudling Equipment Company, Inc.’s liability, and the fact
that the instant Motion is unopposed, the unopposed Motion for determination of
good faith settlement is GRANTED. The legal standards and requirements of CCP
§877.6 and of Tech-Bilt v. Woodward-Clyde & Assoc. (1985) 38 Cal.3d
488 are all met.
