Defendant Dietz International
Public Adjusters of California’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is SUSTAINED
with 30 days leave to amend. 
 
Moving
Party to give notice.
 
This
fraud action was filed by Plaintiff SEUNG JAE BAEK (“Baek”) on December 29,
2023. Plaintiff alleges the following relevant facts: “On or about 07/18/2022,
BAEK and other lots of persons and entities were sued by ELLIOT... (Case No. 22
STCV 03159), where BAEK was served on or about 01/25/2023. [¶] In said case,
ELLIOT… argued that BAEK fraudulently transferred inventories…using false
invoices prior to the fire (i.e. Arson). [¶] Thereafter, BAEK had been
reasonably and diligently investigating said factual argument of above case,
since 03/02/2023, finding ELLIOT’s intent: 1) to cover up his planned fire and
2) to void, excuse and release his duty and/or liability to pay to the US.
Truste in the course of Bankruptcy proceeding. [¶]… ELLIOTT and his
Co-conspirator JEFF deliberately and fraudulent falsified (faked) material
facts of BAEK’s business invoices (i.e., Day Trippin). [¶] On 7/5/2019, ELLIOTT
and STEPHEN in recognition of Falsified (faked) Invoices… brought to the
Insurance Claim Broker, DIETZ. [¶]…Insurance claim broker (i.e. Dietz
International Public Adjusters of California) designed and encouraged this
falsification of invoices, so as to maximize claim amount.” (Complaint
¶¶10-15.) “ELLIOT and JEFF changed, altered and modified material facts of
BAEK’s invoices, exactly matching to the material terms of Insurance policy
Declaration in that: 1) billing address of faked invoices to the same site of
fire as insurance policy indicating at 1901 E. 55th St., Vernon CA
90058; and 2) Numbers of Item shipped and their Prices to Increase of
Inventories value burned and scored.” (Complaint ¶16.) Thereafter, more than
$4,200,000.00 of the claim amount was determined to pay upon Dietz’s brokerage,
where $163,936.20 was paid to Dietz International. (Complaint ¶17.) “[I]t was
clear that BAEK was a ‘Scapegoat,’ maliciously and deliberately being used by
ELLIOT, who wanted to cover up his planned ARSON.” (Complaint ¶19.) 

Plaintiff’s Complaint asserts the following causes of action: 
 
(1)
Fraudulent
Misrepresentation; 
(2)
Falsification
of Documents (Negligence Per Se); and 
(3)
Negligence
 
The
Court notes that as of June 14, 2024, this action has not been deemed related
to any other pending civil action throughout the Los Angeles Superior Court,
and no Notice of Related case has been filed in this action. 
 
Defendant
Dietz International Public Adjusters of California (“Dietz”) specially and
generally demurs to the first and second causes of action. 
 
Uncertainty

 
Dietz argues that the first and second causes of action are fatally uncertain. This argument lacks merit because
“[a] special demurrer for uncertainty is not intended to reach the failure to
incorporate sufficient facts in the pleading but is directed at the uncertainty
existing in the allegations actually made.” (Butler v. Sequeira (1950)
100 Cal.App.2d 143, 145-146.) Moreover, demurrers for uncertainty are
disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that the
defendant cannot reasonably respond, i.e., he or she cannot reasonably
determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are
directed against him or her. (Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif. Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even
where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be
clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.) Here, it is clear
from Dietz’s other arguments that it understands what the Complaint at least
attempts to allege, and there is no true uncertainty. The Demurrer is not
sustained on the basis of uncertainty. 
 
First
Cause of Action – Fraudulent Misrepresentation 
 
The
elements of a fraudulent misrepresentation cause of action are: (a)
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b)
knowledge of falsity (or “scienter”); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce
reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Engalia v.
Permanente Medical Group, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 974.) 
 
“Fraud
must be pleaded with specificity… [t]o withstand a demurrer, the facts
constituting every element of the fraud must be alleged with particularity, and
the claim cannot be salvaged by references to the general policy favoring the
liberal construction of pleadings. (Goldrich v. Natural Y Surgical
Specialties, Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 772, 782.) “This particularity
requirement necessitates pleading facts which ‘show how, when, where, to whom,
and by what means the representations were tendered.’” (Stansfield v.
Starkey (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 59, 73.) 
 
This
lawsuit arises out of an insurance fraud scheme.  Defendant Elliot Tishibi (“Tishibi”) confided
in Baek a plan to set fire to their business to collect insurance
proceeds.  Baek agreed to keep the scheme
a secret, but eventually disclosed the scheme after Tishibi sued Baek for
fraudulent transfer. 
 
Dietz
argues that whatever the dispute between Baek and Tishibi, the Complaint does
not state a cause of action against Dietz. 

 
The
Complaint alleges that Tishibi and Defendant Stephen Jung brought falsified
invoices to Dietz, their insurance claim broker. (¶14.) Dietz “designed and
encouraged this falsification of invoices” so as to maximize the claim amount.
(¶15.) Dietz was paid
$163,936.20 from the proceeds of the claim. (¶17.) 
 
The
demurrer to the first cause of action is SUSTAINED with 30 days leave to amend.
As alleged, the Complaint does not allege any facts tending to show how or when
Dietz “designed and encouraged” false invoices, how Dietz knew the invoices
were false, how Baek relied upon the false invoices, and what damages Baek has
suffered (if any). The only damages alleged appear to be for the recovery of
damages claimed in the other unrelated civil action. (see Complaint, Prayer
¶3.) 
 
Second
Cause of Action – Falsification of Documents (Negligence Per Se) 
 
As
argued in the instant Demurrer, negligence per se is not a separate and
independent cause of action. (Ev. Code §669; Quiroz v. Seventh Ave. Center
(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1256.) Negligence per se is not a separate cause of
action, as it is rooted in the underlying theory of negligence. (Quiroz
at 1256.) While some cases have allowed negligence per se to be alleged, even
where a claim for general negligence is barred, those cases involve unique
circumstances not presented here. (Capri v. L.A. Fitness Int’l, LLC
(2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 1078.) 
 
In
light of the liberality associated with granting leave to amend, and to the
extent that Plaintiff is able to do so, leave to amend is granted. The demurrer
to the second cause of action is SUSTAINED with 30 days leave to amend.
