And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Ford Motor Company's Motion for Protective Order. The Court grants the motion with limitations. The Defendant seeks to modify the Los Angeles Superior Court Model Order (LASC Order) to define affiliated attorneys as attorneys of the same firm, require all personnel at Plaintiffs' counsel's office to sign the Proposed Order, remove subsection (g) which allows disclosure to mock jurors, and modify Paragraph 8 to prohibit posting confidential documents to any website or advertising them for sale. The Court grants Defendant's request to define affiliated attorneys as attorneys of the same firm, denies Defendant's request to require all personnel to sign the Proposed Order, denies Defendant's request to remove subsection (g), grants Defendant's request to modify Paragraph 7(d) and (g), and denies Defendant's request to modify Paragraph 8 and 21.
