Plaintiffs Gloria
Granados and Hector Jimenez’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for
Production of Documents (set one) is GRANTED. 
 
Moving party to give
notice. 
 
This lemon law action
was filed on November 15, 2022. Plaintiffs Gloria Granados and Hector Jimenez
(“Plaintiffs”) move to compel further responses to RPD (set one) from Defendant
Mercedez-Benz USA, LLC (“Defendant”). On April 25, 2024, the Court determined
that the parties had not exhausted their meet and confer obligations, so the
hearing on the motion was continued to this date. The parties were ordered to
meet and confer and file a Joint Statement on or before June 10, 2024. 
This Court has
reviewed the Joint Statement filed by Plaintiff on June 10, 2024. It does not
appear as though Defendant fully responded to, or produced any supplemental
responses or documents in response to Plaintiffs’ further meet and confer
efforts. 
The Court has also
reviewed the untimely unilateral statement filed without leave of Court by
Defendant on June 18, 2024. Defendant agrees to produce supplemental responses
and documents to RPD Nos. 37-41 and 46. The parties have reached an impasse as
to RPD No. 18. 
As to RFP
Nos. 37-41 and 46, the Motion is GRANTED pursuant to the agreement of Defendant
to produce supplemental responses and documents. (See JS 1:¶¶13-20; Def.
Statement 0:24-28..) 
 
The Motion
is also GRANTED as to RPD No. 18, which seeks the operative Franchise Agreement
on the date of sale of the Subject Vehicle between Defendant and the dealership
that sold the Subject Vehicle to Plaintiff. This document is relevant to the
instant litigation to show the degree of control, if any, Defendant exercised
over the dealership. 
 
The court shall impose a monetary sanction against the party who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further responses to
interrogatories or demand for production of documents unless the party subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or the sanction would
otherwise be unjust. (Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (d), 2031.310,
subd. (h), 2033.290, subd. (d).) 
Plaintiff’s Requests
for Sanctions are DENIED. The Court does not find that Defendant acted without
substantial justification.
