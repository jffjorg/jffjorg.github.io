And here is the English-text summary:

In a tentative ruling, the judge grants the unopposed motion for determination of good faith settlement made by SPAUDLING EQUIPMENT COMPANY, INC. The judge considers the factors set forth in Tech-Bilt v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) to determine the good faith of the settlement. The settlement is deemed to be made in good faith as it is not grossly disproportionate to the settling defendant's liability and is within the reasonable range of the settling tortfeasor's share of liability for the plaintiff's injuries. The judge also considers the practical considerations, including the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interest of non-settling parties. The settlement is deemed to be made in good faith, and the moving party is required to give notice.
