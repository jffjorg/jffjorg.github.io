And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies without prejudice the application of Doreen M. Esparza to substitute in as successor in interest to the Decedent, Ricardo Orosco Martinez. The Court finds that the application does not comply with the mandatory terms of CCP §377.32, specifically failing to state that no proceeding is now pending in California for administration of the Decedent's estate and that no other person has a superior right to commence the action or be substituted for the Decedent in the pending action or proceeding. The Decedent passed away on January 7, 2024, and the pending action does not abate.
