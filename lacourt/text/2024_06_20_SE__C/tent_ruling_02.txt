No
Oppositions filed as of June 14, 2024.  
 
The
Court finds that Counsel has met the procedural requirements, including proper
notice to the client at the last known residence or business address of the
client.  C.R.C. 3.1362.
 
Here,
Counsel’s declaration indicates that there has been a breakdown of the
attorney-client relationship. Where the issue (or conflict) is between the
lawyer and client(s), without implicating other parties, the court can rely on
counsel’s sworn declaration absent any reason to doubt the representations. 
 
There
is an undisputed breakdown in attorney-client communications. It does not
appear that Attorney Park’s continued representation would serve the interests
of justice. The motions to withdraw are GRANTED.
