 Case Number:  23NWCP00389    Hearing Date:   June 20, 2024    Dept:  C Plexe,
LLC v. Moranchel, Case No. 23NWCP00389
 
This
is an application for entry of judgment on a sister state judgment. Defendant
did not make payments on a loan she personally guaranteed. The agreement
includes a provision that reads as follows: “The parties submit to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Colorado and of United States of
America.” On November 2, 2022, Plaintiff provided a notice of default to
Defendant and Defendant did not respond. Plaintiff then filed a complaint in
Colorado state. On or about June 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Default
Judgment. On or about August 10, 2023, the Colorado court entered judgment
against the Defendant. 
 
On
October 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed its Application for Entry of Judgment on
Sister State Judgment in this Court. On November 7, 2023, Defendant filed a
motion to vacate entry of the sister court judgment. Defendant reserved a
hearing date of June 13, 2024. According to the online Register of Actions, on
April 20, 2024, Defendant rescheduled the hearing for June 5, 2025, one year
later. Plaintiff moves ex parte to advance the hearing date. 
 
A
party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing "irreparable
harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex
parte." (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c).)
 
Plaintiff
argues that irreparable harm may occur because Defendant will move or dissipate
assets to avoid having to pay the judgment. Plaintiff further argues that
debtors often do this to frustrate the creditor and make it more expensive to
collect.
 
The
Court grants the motion. It advances the motion to June 20, 2024 and continues
it to Thursday, July 25, 2024 at 10:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C.
