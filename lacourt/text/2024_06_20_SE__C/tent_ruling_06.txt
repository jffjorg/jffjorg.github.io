#5
 
Plaintiff’s
unopposed Renewed Motion to Compel Compliance with the Court’s January 24, 2024

Alternative Requests for Evidentiary or Issue Sanctions are MOOT. The
Alternative Request for Terminating Sanctions is GRANTED. Defendant AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR
CO.,’s Answer is STRICKEN. 
 
Moving
Party to give notice. 
 
No
Opposition filed as of June 18, 2024.  On
May 10, 2024, Counsel Soheyl Tahsildoost filed a substitution of attorney on
behalf of Defendant American Honda Motor Co. (“Defendant”) in place of former
counsel Armen Hairapetian.  
 
“To
the extent authorized by this chapter governing any particular discovery method
or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected
party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose
[sanctions] against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the
discovery process …” (CCP §2023.030.) Failing to respond to an authorized
method of discovery and disobeying a court order to provide discovery are both
misuses of the discovery process.” (CCP §§2023.010 (d) and (g).) Sanctions
which may be imposed for a misuse of the discovery process include “terminating
sanctions.” (CCP §2023.030, subd. (d).)
 
Plaintiffs
Hae Won Lee and Bora Violet Park (“Plaintiffs”) seek an order to compel
Defendant to comply with this Court’s January 24, 2024 Order, or alternatively,
terminating sanctions on the basis that Defendant is refusing to participate in
the discovery process. Specifically, Defendant has failed to comply with this
Court’s June 23, 2023 CMC Order, and this Court’s January 24, 2024 Order
ordering compliance with the June 23, 2023 CMC Order. 
 
It
is a commonly stated axiom that discovery sanctions “should be appropriate to
the dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978)
84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793.) However, a court is empowered to apply the ultimate
sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with
discovery obligations. The refusal to reveal material evidence is deemed to be
an admission that the claim or defense is without merit. (Id. at
794-795.) 
 
Where no Opposition to the instant Motion has been filed as of June
18, 2024, it is undisputed that Defendant is unwilling to comply with their
discovery obligations. 
 
The Court finds that terminating sanctions are warranted here. The
information sought by Plaintiff is important to this case. Defendant’s refusal
to participate in this litigation supports the conclusion that lesser sanctions
would not be appropriate. 
 
The motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED as indicated above.
Defendant’s Answer is STRICKEN. Further monetary sanctions are DENIED as
unnecessarily punitive.  Evidentiary and
Issue Sanctions are rendered MOOT.
