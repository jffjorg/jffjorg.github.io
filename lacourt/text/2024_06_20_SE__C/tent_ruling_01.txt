TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff and Judgment Creditor Blaine
Holdings & Development, LLC’s Motion to Compel Compliance is GRANTED. The
Court awards sanctions in the amount of $2,115.00. 
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
The motion is unopposed as of June 17, 2024. 
 
Plaintiff Blaine
Holding & Development LLC sued defendant Vivera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for breaching
a commercial lease agreement and then holding over following the lease’s
expiration. On September 15, 2021, this Court entered judgment in favor of
Plaintiff in the amount of $406,657.19. (Decl. Yost, ¶ 3.) Defendant and
Judgement Debtor has not paid any of it.  (Decl. Yost, ¶ 5.) 
 
On July 1, 2021, Vivera
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. CEO Paul Edalat registered Pala Diagnostics with the
California Secretary of State. (Decl. Yost, ¶ 6.) On July 23, 2021, Vivera Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., and Dalrada Health Inc. executed a Limited Liability Company Agreement to
operate Pala Diagnostics. (Decl. Yost, ¶ 7.) Under the LLC Agreement, Vivera Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. is a minority member with a 49 percent interest in Pala Diagnostics. (Decl.
Yost, ¶ 8.)
 
In December 2021,
Vivera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. sued Pala Diagnostics in Orange County Superior
Court seeking judicial dissolution of the joint venture (the “Orange County
Action”). (Decl. Yost, ¶ 9.)
 
On January 19, 2023,
Dalrada Health Inc. moved to stay the Orange County action and conduct an
appraisal to ascertain the value of Vivera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s 49 percent
interest in Pala Diagnostics pursuant to Section 17707.03(c) of the
Corporations Code. (Decl. Yost, ¶ 10.) That provision provides that judicial
dissolution may be avoided “by purchasing for cash the membership interests
owned by the members so initiating the proceeding . . . at their fair market
value.” (Corp. Code § 17707.03(c)(1).) On March 6, 2023, the Orange County
Superior Court granted Dalrada Health Inc.’s motion, stayed the action, and
ordered an appraisal of Vivera Pharmaceutical Inc.’s 49 percent interest to be
completed no later than July 10, 2023. (Decl. Yost, ¶ 11.) Vivera Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. and Dalrada Health Inc. engaged a third party to conduct one of three
appraisals of Vivera Pharmaceutical, Inc.’s interest in Pala Diagnostics. (Decl.
Yost, ¶ 11.) The appraisal has been delayed multiple times and, to date, no
draft or final appraisal has been issued. (Decl. Yost, ¶ 12.)
 
On May 9, 2023, Blaine
Holding & Development, LLC moved this Court for an order: (1) charging
Vivera Pharmaceutical, Inc.’s 49 percent interest in Pala Diagnostics with the
unpaid balance of the judgment pursuant to Section 708.3102 ; (2) assigning
Vivera Pharmaceutical, Inc.’s 49 percent interest in Pala Diagnostics to Blaine
Holding pursuant to Section 708.510; and (3) restraining Vivera
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. from encumbering, assigning, disposing, or spending its
49 percent interest in Pala Diagnostics. (Decl. Yost, ¶ 13.) On June 28, 2023,
this Court granted the motion in its entirety. (Decl. Yost, ¶ 14 & Ex. 1.)
 
On June 5, 2024, the
Court held a judgment debtor examination of the person most knowledgeable for
Vivera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
 
Plaintiff and Judgment
Creditor moves to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena of business
records served on non-party Paul Zimmer and CBIZ Forensic Services Group, LLC.
The subpoena requests draft and final valuation reports; documents submitted by
the parties in support of the valuation reports; and communications between the
appraisers and the parties. Plaintiff and Judgment Creditor also seeks
sanctions. 
 
Legal
Standard

A
deposition subpoena for business records directs a nonparty's “custodian of
records” to deliver a copy of the requested documents to a “deposition officer”
or to make the original documents available to the subpoenaing party for
inspection and copying. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2020.410, subd. (c); 2020.430,
subd. (a)-(e).) 
Meet
and Confer
No
meeting and conferring are required where the deponent fails to produce the
documents described in the deposition notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (b)(2).) A declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the
deponent to inquire about the nonappearance is sufficient. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (b)(2).)
Plaintiff
and Judgment Creditor complied with the above requirements. (Decl. Yost, ¶¶ 27,
30.)
Timeliness
The
motion must be made no later than 60 days after the completion of the record of
the deposition. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (b).) The deposition record
is “complete” as of the “date specified for production.” (Board of
Registered Nursing v. Super. Ct. (Johnson & Johnson) (2021) 59
Cal.App.5th 1011, 1032-1033.)
Plaintiff and Judgment
Creditor issued a deposition subpoena for business records to Paul Zimmer and
CBIZ Forensic Services Group, LLC on January 12, 2024. (Decl. Yost, ¶ 18, Ex. 2.)
The date for production stated on the subpoena is March 14, 2024. (Decl. Yost,
¶ 18, Ex. 2.) Plaintiff and Judgment Creditor filed the instant motion on April
2, 2024. 
 
Thus, Plaintiff and
Judgment Creditor is timely. 
 
Compel Compliance
 
“‘An order compelling discovery must rest on a showing that
the discovery is reasonably calculated to lead to admissible
evidence….’"  (Cadiz Land Co. v.
Rail Cycle (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 74, 117.) Further, a motion to compel
production of documents described in a deposition notice must be accompanied by
a showing of good cause, i.e. declarations containing specific facts justifying
inspection of the documents. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(1).) The
burden rests upon the party seeking the discovery to provide evidence from
which the court may determine these conditions are met. (Calcor Space
Facility, Inc. v. Super. Ct. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 223-224.) 
 
Plaintiff and Judgment Creditor advances the declaration of
its counsel, Mark J. Yost. He states that Plaintiff and Judgment Creditor became
concerned that the repeated delay of the appraisal may be due to an attempt by
Vivera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Dalrada Health Inc. to improperly influence
the valuation of Pala Diagnostics and/or to structure a settlement that
improperly evades Plaintiff and Judgment Creditor’s lien. (Decl. Yost, ¶ 15.)  Plaintiff and Judgment Creditor asserts that
it seeks the records as part of post-judgment discovery. 
 
Because the information will help Plaintiff and Judgment
Creditor enforce the judgment, the Court finds that Defendant has provided
evidence to show that there is good cause and the requested discovery is
reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence. 
 
Based on the above, the motion to compel compliance is
GRANTED. 
 
Sanctions
 
If the prevailing party asks
for monetary sanctions, the Court shall impose a monetary sanction against the
losing party unless it finds the losing party acted with substantial
justification or other circumstances make imposition of the sanction unjust.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)
 
Yost states that he spent 3.2 hours drafting the moving
papers. (Decl. Yost, ¶ 32.) He anticipates spending 1.5 hours drafting a reply
and another 1.5 hours to prepare and appear for the hearing. (Decl. Yost, ¶ 32.)
His rate is $650 an hour. (Decl. Yost, ¶ 33.) He seeks an award of 6.0 hours
billed at $450 per hour. (Decl. Yost, ¶ 34.) 
 
Because the motion is unopposed, Yost does not need to
draft a reply. Thus, the court awards attorney fees in the amount of $2,115.00
for 4.7 hours of work at $450 per hour.
