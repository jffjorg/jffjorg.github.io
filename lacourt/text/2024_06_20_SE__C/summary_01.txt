The Court finds that the request is reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence and that there is good cause for the discovery. The Court also awards sanctions in the amount of $2,115.00 to the Plaintiff and Judgment Creditor for the time spent by counsel drafting the moving papers and preparing for the hearing.
