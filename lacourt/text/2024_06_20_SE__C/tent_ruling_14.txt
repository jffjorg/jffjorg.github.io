Portions of Cross-Complainants’ RICHARD R. VAZQUEZ and STEPHANIE MONTEZ’s
Cross-Complaint is CONTINUED to Thursday,

Moving Party to give notice. 
 
This action was filed on January 18, 2024 by Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
ANDREW CRUZ ALDACO (“Cross-Defendant”). 
 
On March 12, 2024, Defendants/Cross-Complainants RICHARD R. VASQUEZ and
STEPHANIE MONTEZ (collectively “Cross-Complainants”) filed the subject
Cross-Complaint. At the time the Cross-Complaint was filed, the
Cross-Complainants were self-represented litigants. 
 
On March 20, 2024, a Substitution of Attorney was filed indicating that
Attorney Joseph W. Kellener substituted in as counsel of record for
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Stephanie Montez. 
 
The Court’s file reflects that Attorney Kellener also attempted to
substitute in as counsel of record for Defendant/Cross-Complainant Richard R.
Vasquez. However, the Substitution of Attorney form to effectuate this
substitution was REJECTED by the Court due to formatting/clerical discrepancies
on the Substitution of Attorney form. At this time, Richard R. Vasquez is still
a self-represented litigant. 
 
The Declaration of Neil J. Cacali, filed in conjunction with the subject
Demurrer and Motion to Strike indicates that due to a car accident involving
Mr. Kellener, and the confusion regarding representation of the parties, no
meet and confer occurred prior to the filing of the subject Demurrer and Motion
to Strike. 
 
As of June 17, 2024, the subject Motions are unopposed. 
 
This matter is CONTINUED as indicated above. Attorney Kellener is
ORDERED to re-file the Substitution of Attorney form to effectuate his
substitution in as counsel of record for Richard R. Vasquez. 
 
The parties are further ORDERED to meet and confer in an effort to
informally resolve the issues outlined in the subject Demurrer and Motion to
Strike, per Code, prior to the hearing date. Opposition and Reply may be filed
and served per Code in accordance with the new hearing date.
