And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the joint statement filed by the plaintiff on June 10, 2024, and has determined that the defendant has not fully responded to the plaintiff's request for production of documents. The court grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to request for production of documents (set one) and orders the defendant to produce supplemental responses and documents to RPD Nos. 37-41 and 46. The court also grants the plaintiff's motion as to RPD No. 18, which seeks the operative franchise agreement on the date of sale of the subject vehicle between the defendant and the dealership that sold the subject vehicle to the plaintiff. The court does not impose monetary sanctions on the defendant, as it does not find that the defendant acted without substantial justification.
