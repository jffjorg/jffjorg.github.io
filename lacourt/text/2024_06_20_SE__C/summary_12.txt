And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by Dietz International Public Adjusters of California to the complaint filed by Seung Jae Baek. The demurrer was filed to the first and second causes of action, which are fraud and falsification of documents. The judge has sustained the demurrer to both causes of action, but has granted leave to amend the complaint.

The judge found that the complaint does not allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action against Dietz International. The complaint does not specifically allege how Dietz International designed and encouraged the falsification of invoices, how it knew the invoices were false, or how the plaintiff relied on the false invoices. Additionally, the complaint does not specify the damages suffered by the plaintiff.

The judge also found that negligence per se is not a separate and independent cause of action. The judge has granted leave to amend the complaint to allow the plaintiff to plead sufficient facts to state a cause of action against Dietz International.

The judge has ordered that the demurrer be sustained with 30 days leave to amend, and has given notice to the moving party.
