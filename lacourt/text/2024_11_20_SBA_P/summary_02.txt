Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Scott Murray, to the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, American Premier Holding Group, LLC, alleges a cause of action for breach of commercial lease agreement.

The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action and must amend the complaint to cure the defects. The court has also sustained the demurrer on the basis of statute of limitations, finding that the complaint was not timely filed.

However, the court has overruled the demurrer for uncertainty, finding that the complaint is not so uncertain that the defendant cannot reasonably respond to it. The court has also granted leave to amend the complaint to allege compliance with the statute of limitations.

Additionally, the court has sustained the demurrer due to lack of capacity to sue, finding that the plaintiff is a suspended corporation and lacks the capacity to prosecute or defend an action. The court has granted leave to amend the complaint to cure this defect.

The court has ordered the prevailing party to give notice of the ruling.
