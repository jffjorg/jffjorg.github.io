 Case Number:  24TRCV02200    Hearing Date:   November 20, 2024    Dept:  P Demurrer  to Plaintiff’s Complaint   Moving  Party: Defendant Scott  Murray          Responding Party: None   RULING   Having  considered the moving papers, Defendant’s demurrer is SUSTAINED.PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND   On July 1, 2024, Plaintiff American Premier Holding Group, LLC  (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendant Scott Murray (“Defendant”)  alleging a cause of action for (1) Breach of Commercial Lease Agreement.   On October 7, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion. On November 8,  2024, Defendant filed a notice of non-opposition. As of November 18, 2024, no  opposition has been filed.   FACTUAL BACKGROUND   On  November 27, 2013, Defendant made, executed, and delivered to Plaintiff a  written Commercial Single-Tenant Lease Agreement (the “Lease”). (Complaint, ¶  4.) Defendant agreed to pay $4,500.00 each month. (Complaint, ¶ 4.)   On May 16,  2019, Plaintiff raised the monthly rent to $8,700.00. (Complaint, ¶ 6.) On  November 15, 2023, Defendant breached the Lease by failing to render payment.  (Complaint, ¶ 8.) From November 15, 2023 to February 15, 2024, when Plaintiff  received full possession of the property, Defendant failed to make monthly  payments. (Complaint, ¶ 8.)   LEGAL STANDARD             A party may demur to a complaint on the grounds that it “does not state  facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10,  subd. (e).) A party may also demur to a complaint on the grounds that the  complaint is uncertain. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).) A demurrer  tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)  147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) A special demurrer for uncertainty under Code of  Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (f), is disfavored and will only be  sustained where the pleading is so bad that defendant or plaintiff cannot  reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what issues must be  admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against him or her.(Khoury  v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)    When considering demurrers, courts accept all well pleaded facts as true.  (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) “A  demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic  matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the  pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)  153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is  whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,  states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p.  747.) On demurrer, a court does “not accept contentions, deductions or  conclusions of fact or law.” (Simonyan v. Nationwide Insurance Company of  America (2022) 78 Cal.App.5th 889, 895.)    Although courts construe pleadings liberally, sufficient facts must be  alleged to support the allegations pled to survive a demurrer. (Rakestraw v.  California Physicians' Serv. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) Where a  demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a  reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy  (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on the party who filed the pleading  subject to demurrer to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully.  (Ibid.)   DISCUSSION               Request for Judicial Notice   Defendant requests judicial notice of search results from the California  Secretary of State’s Business Entity Search portal. Pursuant to Evid. Code  section 452, subd. (c), the court may take notice of the official acts of  legislative, executive, and judicial departments of any state.   Defendant’s request for judicial notice is GRANTED.   Moving Party’s Argument   Defendant demurs to the sole cause of action on the grounds that it is  uncertain, as it does not contain the whole Lease. Further, Plaintiff is not a  business entity in good standing and cannot bring an action.   Merits of the Motion   A.  Meet and Confer   Defense counsel declares that the parties have not been able to  meaningfully meet and confer. Accordingly, the court finds that the parties  have not satisfied the meet and confer requirements. However, the court will  still discuss the merits of the demurrer.   B.  Demurrer for Uncertainty   A demurrer to a pleading lies where the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous,  or unintelligible. (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10, subd. (f).) “A demurrer for  uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects  uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery  procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th  612, 616, disapproved on other grounds in Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title  Guar. Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 46 [holding claims for unfair business  practices need not be pled specifically, impliedly disapproving Khoury].)  As a result, a special demurrer for uncertainty is not intended to reach  failure to incorporate sufficient facts in the pleading but is directed only at  uncertainty existing in the allegations already made. (People v. Taliaferro  (1957) 149 Cal.App.2d 822, 825, disapproved on other grounds in Jefferson v.  J.E. French Co. (1960) 54 Cal.2d 717, 719-720 [statute of limitations  question].)    Where complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action and to apprise  defendant of issues he is to meet, it is not properly subject to a special  demurrer for uncertainty. (See ibid.; see also Gressley v. Williams  (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643 [“A special demurrer [for uncertainty] should be  overruled where the allegations of the complaint are sufficiently clear to  apprise the defendant of the issues which he is to meet”].)    Defendant demurs on the basis of uncertainty because the attached Lease  does not contain all seventeen pages. Further, the attached pages do not  contain a signature page. Thus, because an incomplete Lease is attached, the statement  “A true and correct copy of the Commerical Lease Agreement…” is false and  uncertain.   On demurrer, the court may only consider defects that appear on the face  of the complaint, including attached exhibits. (Panterra GP, Inc. v. Superior  Court of Kern County (2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 697, 708.) Here, the attached  Lease does lack a signature page. However, the first paragraph shows that the  Plaintiff is the lessor and Defendant is the lessee. Further, the Lease  indicates that Defendant is obligated to make a monthly payment of $4,500 for  the term of the Lease.   Taken as a whole, Plaintiff’s complaint is not so uncertain that  Defendant cannot be reasonably expected to respond to it.   Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer for uncertainty is OVERRULED.   C.  Failure to State a Cause of  Action   Defendant demurs to the sole cause of action on the grounds that  Plaintiff has not stated a cause of action because the complaint does not  allege that both parties entered into the Lease. The complaint merely states  that Defendant made, executed, and delivered the Lease to Plaintiff. Defendant  also argues that the attached pages of the Lease do not contain the essential  terms of a valid lease agreement, and thus it cannot be enforceable. In  support, Defendant cites to Levin v. Saroff (1921) 54 Cal.App. 285, 289,  which held that a valid lease agreement must contain a definite term;  description of the boundary of the leased property; and agreed upon price of  rental, and time and manner of payment.   As noted above, the Lease shows that Plaintiff is the lessor and  Defendant is the lessee. The Lease identifies the subject premises, the term,  base rent, and acceptable methods of payment. Thus, the Lease contains the  essential terms of a valid lease agreement. The complaint further alleges that  Defendant breached the Lease by failing to make the required monthly payments  in November 2023.    At this stage of the proceedings, Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts  to state a cause of action for breach of contract.   Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer is OVERRULED.   D.  Statute of Limitations   Defendant also raises the defense of statute of limitations, arguing that  Plaintiff’s action should have been brought no later than December 31, 2021.   On demurrer, the court accepts all well-pleaded facts as true and  liberally construes the complaint to consider all reasonable inferences. (Wilner  v. Sunset Life Ins. Co. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 952, 958.)   Here, the Lease does show that its term ended on December 31, 2017. While  the Lease appears to contain an addendum providing the parties with an option  to renew the Lease, it is incomplete and contains only a portion of the written  contract. (Complaint, Exh. 1, p. 2, ¶ 1.11.) Exhibit 2 of the complaint shows  correspondence between the parties, discussing an increase in rent, effective March  16, 2020 and the complaint also alleges that a breach did not occur until  November 15, 2023.    Plaintiff does not allege that the parties exercised an option to renew  the terms of the Lease through November 2023 or whether a subsequent,  superseding lease was signed. Thus, on its face Plaintiff’s complaint was not  timely filed.   Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer on the basis of statute of limitations  is SUSTAINED.   E.  Lack of Capacity to Sue   Defendant also demurs to the complaint because a suspended corporation  has no right to prosecute or defend an action. In support, Defendant provides  screenshots from a search conducted on the California Secretary of State’s  Business Entity Search. The search results indicate that there is no active  business registered in the state containing the phrase “American Premier  Holding.”   A demurrer is properly sustained when a plaintiff lacks capacity to sue,  and a suspended lacks capacity to sue. (Friends of Shingle Springs  Interchange, Inc. v. County of El Dorado (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1470,  1482.) Plaintiff does not appear to be an LLC in good standing, and thus, it  cannot maintain an action.   Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer is SUSTAINED.   F.  Leave to Amend   Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of  successful amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349  [court shall not “sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is any  reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment”] The burden  is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully.  (Ibid.)   Here, the attachments to the complaint itself are facially  incomplete.  Therefore, the court grants  leave to amend the complaint to allege compliance with the statute of  limitations.   A suspended corporation may not prosecute or defend an action. (Timberline,  Inc. v Jaisinghani (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 1361, 1365.) “However, if the corporation’s  status only comes to light during litigation, the normal practice is for the  trial court to permit a short continuance to enable the suspended corporation  to effect reinstatement… to defend itself in court.” (Id. at p. 1366.)   Accordingly, Plaintiff may effect reinstatement and properly prosecute  this action. Thus, leave to amend is GRANTED.   CONCLUSION              Based on the foregoing, the court SUSTAINS the demurrer with leave to  amend.   Prevailing party on motion is ordered to give notice of ruling.
