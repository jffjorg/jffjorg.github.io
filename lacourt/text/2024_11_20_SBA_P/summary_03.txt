And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the moving papers, opposition, and reply in this case. The defendant, Jae Ho Yoon, has filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint, alleging that the complaint does not state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. The plaintiff, JY and JA Investment, LLC, has filed an opposition to the demurrer, arguing that the complaint sufficiently states the facts.

The court has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, which means that the plaintiff has the opportunity to amend the complaint to address the defects identified by the court. The court has also granted the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's request for punitive damages.

The court's ruling is based on the fact that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state sufficient facts to support its claims of breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and professional negligence. Specifically, the court found that the plaintiff's allegations of damages are conclusory and do not provide sufficient factual support.

The court has given the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to address these deficiencies and has granted the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's request for punitive damages. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
