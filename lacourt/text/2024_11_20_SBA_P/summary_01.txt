And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel binding arbitration filed by Tesla Motors, Inc. (Defendant) in a lawsuit brought by Taiwo Alabi (Plaintiff) alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The dispute arises from defects in a Tesla Model Y purchased by Plaintiff and Defendant's failure to repair the vehicle during the warranty period. The court found that the arbitration agreement in the Retail Installment Sales Contract (Sale Contract) is enforceable and covers the controversy. The court also rejected Plaintiff's arguments that the arbitration clause is unconscionable and that Defendant cannot enforce it because it is a manufacturer trying to enforce an arbitration agreement between the purchaser and a dealership, as Defendant sells its cars directly to customers. The court granted the motion and stayed the action pending the conclusion of the arbitration process.
