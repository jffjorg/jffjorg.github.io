And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' special motion to strike the plaintiff's complaint, citing California's anti-SLAPP statute (Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16). The defendants, The Sanford Firm, Regie Salgado, and Melinda Zambrano, argued that the plaintiff's claims for malicious prosecution and civil conspiracy were brought in furtherance of a public issue and were protected by the anti-SLAPP statute.

The judge found that the plaintiff had not met its burden of demonstrating a probability of success in proving that the defendants brought and maintained the prior action without probable cause. The judge also found that the plaintiff had not met its burden of proving that the defendants acted with malice in bringing the prior action.

The judge concluded that the defendants had a reasonable basis for their belief in their employment status and that they relied in good faith on the advice of counsel. The judge also noted that the Ninth Circuit's denial of the plaintiff's request for attorneys' fees in the prior action further supported the conclusion that the defendants did not act with an improper motive.

The judge granted the defendants' motion to strike, and the defendants are entitled to fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 426.16, subdivision (c)(1).
