 Case Number:  24STCV16236    Hearing Date:   September 13, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Petition of Petitioner Melanie D. De Mattia for Approval of Compromise of Claim
or Action or Disposition of Proceedings of Judgment for Minor or Person with a
Disability as to minor Claimant America Gutierrez.
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff
America Gutierrez, a minor who filed this case through her guardian ad litem, was
crossing the street on August 19, 2023, when she was struck by a motor
vehicle.  She suffered several pelvic fractures
in addition to bruising of her right leg and hip. She has not entirely
recovered from her injuries but has resumed her normal activities. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
Courts must decide whether to approve a compromise by
determining if petitioners, such as guardians, are acting in the best interests
of minors. E.g., Code Civ. Proc., § 372, subdiv. (a); Scruton v. Korean Air
Lines Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-1607. “[T]he protective role the
court generally assumes in cases involving minors, [is] a role to assure that
whatever is done is in the minor’s best interests….  [I]ts primary concern is whether the
compromise is sufficient to provide for the minor’s injuries, care and
treatment.”  Goldberg v. Superior
Court (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1382. Judicial discretion in approving
petitions for minors’ compromises, and ordering distributions, and local court
policies, must be applied in the best interests of minors, in a case-by-case
method, tailored to the circumstances.  Christensen
v. Superior Court (1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 139, 142-144.
A petition for court approval of a compromise under
Code of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court
rules 7.950, 7.951, and 7.952. See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1384(a). Some of
the Probate Code and the Code of Civil Procedure apply to compromises as to
minors’ claims. See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950. In large part, the Local
Rules incorporate by reference the California Rules of Court and statutory
provisions. See Super. Ct. LA County, Local Rules, rule 4.115 et seq.
A payment of attorneys’ fees on the minor’s behalf
must be approved as being reasonable by the court. Niles v. City of San
Rafael (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 230, 244. “The trial court itself must develop
and resolve any counterarguments on behalf of the minor, lest the attorney
receive an excessive award of fees.” Gonzalez v. Chen (2011) 197
Cal.App.4th 881, 887.
 
 
ANALYSIS
In advocating settlement approvals, Petitioner (the
guardian ad litem) represents that she made a careful and diligent inquiry and
investigation into the facts and circumstances, the responsibility, and the
claimants’ injuries.
Here, the Court finds that Petitioner is acting in the
minor’s best interests in proposing to obtain approval for the settlement and
minor’s compromise. The Court finds that the proposed settlement amount of $20,000.00
is reasonable considering the Plaintiff’s injuries and expected recovery. 
If the settlement is approved, $5,500 will be used for
Plaintiff’s medical expenses.
Additionally, Plaintiff’s attorney seeks $5,000 in
attorney’s fees, reflecting 25 percent of the recovery under a written
attorney-client contingency fee agreement. Plaintiff’s attorney affirms that 25
percent of the gross settlement is his normal rate for minors in personal
injury cases. Garber Decl., ¶3. Plaintiff’s attorney further affirms that he bore
the financial risk in this case and advanced all litigation costs. Id.,
¶3. Based on counsel’s declaration, the requested fees are reasonable. 
Likewise, expenses advanced by Plaintiff’s attorney,
consisting of a $435 filing fee and $275 for an asset search on Defendant, are
reasonable and leave a balance of $8,790.
Petitioner intends to disburse fees as described above
and deposit the remaining balance in a blocked account. Petitioners properly
included the name, branch, and address of the financial institution where the
funds will be deposited as attachment 18b(2).  Accordingly, the Petition is granted.
 
CONCLUSION
Therefore, the Petition is granted as prayed. The
Court will sign and file the proposed order filed by Petitioner. Petitioner
also needs to submit a filled-out Order to Deposit Funds into Blocked Account
(MC-355) for the Court to sign.
