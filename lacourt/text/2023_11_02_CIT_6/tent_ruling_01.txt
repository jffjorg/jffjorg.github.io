  Case Number:  22PSCV02056    Hearing Date:   November 2, 2023    Dept:  6 Plaintiff  Rock Creek Capital, LLC’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment  Defendants: Jesus E. Espinoza and Pamela Witrago  TENTATIVE RULING DENY without prejudice.            BACKGROUND             This  is a collection case. Plaintiff Rock Creek Capital, LLC (Plaintiff) is a debt  buyer and acquired a series of education loans from original creditor Sallie  Mae. On November 28, 2022, Plaintiff filed this action against Defendants Jesus  E. Espinoza, Pamela Witrago (Defendants), and Does 1 through 15, alleging one  cause of action for breach of contract. Default was entered against Defendants  on September 27, 2023, which is the same date that Plaintiff submitted its  default judgment package.            LEGAL  STANDARD Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible  evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as  necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of  judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or  an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579,  supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary;  and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement  of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)  ANALYSIS Plaintiff  seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $112,129.36,  including $112,129.36 in principal damages, $0.00 in prejudgment interest, $0.00  in attorney fees, and $0.00 in costs. However, the Court finds there are some  issues that need to be addressed here. First, the principal damages calculation  is comprised in part of $28,050.80 in interest that accrued before the loan was  charged off by the original creditor, but Plaintiff has provided no explanation  how that interest was calculated. The documentation submitted in support of the  request for entry of default appears to support the principal loan balance of  $83,928.56 and a $150.00 late fee at the time the loan was charged off, but the  same documentation at most evidences $9,975.39 in accrued interest. (Welch  Decl., Ex. E, p. 6.) Additionally, the Court notes that the loan agreement  appears to be governed by the laws of the State of Utah. (Compl., Ex. A, Smart  Option Student Loan, p. 5.) While this latter point is unlikely to make a  difference, it could potentially affect whether the principal loan interest  rate was legal or properly applied.              Moreover,  Rule 3.1806 of the California Rules of Court requires the plaintiff to  submit the original loan agreement or a declaration in lieu of the original  with the default judgment package. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1806; Kahn  v. Lasorda’s Dugout, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1118, 1123.) CONCLUSION              Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff's request for entry of default is DENIED without prejudice.
