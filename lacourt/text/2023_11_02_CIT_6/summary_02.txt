Summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by the defendant, Langer Juice Company, Inc., is overruled. The plaintiff, Martin Castillo, has filed a personal injury action against the defendant and others, alleging causes of action for premises liability and general negligence. The defendant demurred to both causes of action, arguing that the Privette Doctrine bars the plaintiff's claims because the plaintiff was an independent contractor at the time of the incident. However, the court finds that the plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to state causes of action for premises liability and general negligence, citing the exception set forth in McKown v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (2002). The court orders the defendant to file an answer to the First Amended Complaint within 10 days of the date of the order and requires the plaintiff to give notice of the court's ruling and file proof of service of same within five days of the order.
