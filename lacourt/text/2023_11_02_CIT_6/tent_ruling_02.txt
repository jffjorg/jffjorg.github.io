 Case Number:  23PSCV01056    Hearing Date:   November 2, 2023    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Martin  Castillo v. Langer Juice Company, Inc., et al. Demurrer by Defendant Langer  Juice Company, Inc.  TENTATIVE RULING The Court OVERRULES the demurrer.  Defendant is ordered to file an  answer to the First Amended Complaint within 10 days of the date of this order.  Plaintiff is ordered to give  notice of the Court’s ruling herein and file proof of service of same within  five days of the Court’s order.  BACKGROUND This is a personal injury action.  On April 11, 2023, Plaintiff Martin Castillo (Plaintiff) filed this action  against Defendant Langer Juice Company, Inc. (Defendant) and Does 1 through  100, alleging causes of action for premises liability and general negligence.  On July 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (FAC),  alleging the same causes of action against Defendant.[1]  On September 5, 2023, Defendant  filed the instant demurrer to the FAC. On October 20, 2023, Plaintiff opposed.  On October 26, 2023, Defendant replied.  LEGAL STANDARD A demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal  sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding  the form or content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or  cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., §  422.10; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,  994.) It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of  the complaint; and for purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in  the complaint are assumed to be true. (Id.)  A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear  on the face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading  that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,  318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other  extrinsic evidence can be considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980)  110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in  memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. &  Guar. Co.  (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal  v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider  contents of release not part of court record].)  A demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the  complaint” itself is incomplete or discloses some defense that would bar  recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001) 94  Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The “face of the complaint” includes material  contained in attached exhibits that are incorporated by reference into the  complaint, or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.  Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s  Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as true the contents of the  exhibits and treat as surplusage the pleader’s allegations as to the legal  effect of the exhibits.”]).  A demurrer can only be sustained when it disposes of an  entire cause of action. (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148  Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)   MEET AND CONFER Per Code of Civil Procedure  section 430.41, subdivision (a)(4), the parties were required to meet and  confer before Defendant filed the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41.) The  Court finds the parties’ meet and confer efforts to be sufficient. (Reid Decl.,  ¶ 11.)  DISCUSSION             Analysis             To  state claims for premises liability and general negligence, the plaintiff must  allege facts demonstrating: “1) a legal duty of care, (2) breach  of that duty, and (3) proximate cause resulting  in injury. [Citations.]” (Martinez v. City of Beverly Hills (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th  508, 517.)              Defendant  demurs to both causes of action for premises liability and general negligence on  the grounds that the Privette Doctrine bars Plaintiff’s claims because  the FAC alleges that Plaintiff was an independent contractor at the time of the  incident. (FAC, 9.) Defendant contends the Kinsman exception to the Privette  Doctrine does not apply because the FAC does not allege facts demonstrating  that Defendant knew or should have known about the hazard that led to  Plaintiff’s injuries. (See Kinsman v. Unocal Corp. (2005) 37 Cal.4th 659,  674-675.) Defendant further contends that the second recognized exception to  the Privette Doctrine does not apply here because the FAC does not allege facts demonstrating that  Defendant retained or exercised any control over Plaintiff’s conduct in a  manner that affirmatively contributed to Plaintiff’s injuries. (Hooker v.  Department of Transportation (2002) 27 Cal.4th 198, 210.) Defendant also  cites to the cases of Sandoval v. Qualcomm, Inc. (2021) 12 Cal.5th 256  and Khosh v. Staples Construction Co., Inc. (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 712 to support  these arguments.              In  opposition, Plaintiff cites to the case of McKown v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (2002)  27 Cal.4th 219, which held that, “a hirer is liable to an employee of an  independent contractor insofar as the hirer's provision of unsafe equipment  affirmatively contributes to the employee's injury.” (Id., at p. 222.) Plaintiff  points to the allegations in the FAC which state that, “[t]he pipe which burst  is the property of Defendant LANGER JUICE COMPANY, INC., provided to Plaintiff  for use in his job, and was defective, unsafe, and a concealed hazard at the  time of the incident.” (FAC, ¶ 9.) Plaintiff further contends that the cases  Defendant cites to in support of the demurrer involved plaintiffs that were  specially skilled contractors hired to perform tasks that required specialized  skill, whereas Plaintiff’s skills were that of a general laborer and not  specialized. However, the Court agrees with Plaintiff based on the Supreme  Court’s decision in McKown.              The  FAC alleges that Plaintiff was on the subject property at the time of the  incident which belonged to Defendant. (FAC, ¶¶ 2, 9.) It alleges that Plaintiff  was performing labor for Defendant as an independent contractor, which involved  the transfer of juice from a truck to barrels on the subject property and then  from the barrels to smaller containers. (Id., ¶ 9.) The FAC alleges that  Plaintiff had completed this portion of his labor and was cleaning the  equipment with a hose that produced scalding hot water when a pipe transporting  water suddenly burst above him and burned his whole back and buttocks. (Id.)  The FAC then alleges that the pipe which burst belonged to Defendant and was  defective and that Defendant provided it to Plaintiff for use in Plaintiff’s  labor at the time of the incident. (Id.) The Court finds these  allegations sufficient to state causes of action for premises liability and  general negligence.              The  Court further finds Defendant’s arguments based on the Privette Doctrine  to be unavailing in light of the exception set forth in McKown. As noted  above, the FAC alleges that Defendant provided Plaintiff with the equipment he  was using when the accident occurred. (FAC, ¶ 9.) The Court finds unpersuasive Defendant’s  argument that McKown applies only when the equipment is obviously  defective to the hirer and thereby “negligently” provided. The Supreme Court made  clear in McKown that it is the supplying of the defective equipment that  renders the hirer liable. “’[W]here the hiring  party actively contributes to the injury by supplying defective equipment, it  is the hiring party's own negligence that renders it liable, not that of the  contractor.’” (McKown, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 225.) The Supreme Court further  stated that, “[a]n owner is not liable  for injuries resulting from defective appliances unless he has supplied them…” (McKown,  supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 225, italics in original, quoting (McDonald v. Shell Oil Co.  (1955) 44 Cal.2d 785, 788–789.)  The Court does note that the Supreme Court’s decision in McKown  contains some potentially confusing language on this point by referring to  “negligently furnishing unsafe equipment,” (McKown, supra, 27 Cal.4th at  p. 225). However, the other language quoted above and otherwise stated throughout  that decision makes clear that the Supreme Court was referring to the provision  of the defective equipment itself as constituting negligence, and makes no  mention of whether the hirer was aware of the equipment being defective when  provided to the independent contractor. In fact, in discussing another issue,  the Supreme Court noted that Wal-Mart presumably believed the equipment it  provided was safe. (Id. at p. 226.)  In light of the applicability of the McKown case  addressed herein, the Court declines to address the other cases cited by Defendant  in support of the demurrer.  Based on the foregoing, the Court OVERRULES the demurrer.  CONCLUSION The Court OVERRULES the demurrer.  Defendant is ordered to file an  answer to the First Amended Complaint within 10 days of the date of this order.  Plaintiff is ordered to give  notice of the Court’s ruling herein and file proof of service of same within  five days of the Court’s order.
