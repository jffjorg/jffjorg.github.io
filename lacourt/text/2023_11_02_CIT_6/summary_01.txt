And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment against the defendants, Jesus E. Espinoza and Pamela Witrago. The plaintiff, Rock Creek Capital, LLC, seeks a default judgment of $112,129.36, including principal damages, interest, attorney fees, and costs. However, the court finds that there are several issues that need to be addressed before granting the default judgment. These issues include the calculation of principal damages, the calculation of interest, and compliance with California Rules of Court. The court also notes that the loan agreement appears to be governed by the laws of the State of Utah, which could potentially affect the calculation of interest. Therefore, the court's tentative ruling is to deny the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to address these issues before re-submitting the request.
