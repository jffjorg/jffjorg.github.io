And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The defendants, Mobbil Inc. and Behrouz Bozorgnia, have moved for leave to file a First Amended Answer to the plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint. The proposed amended answer adds two new affirmative defenses: Thirty-Sixth Affirmative Defense of Settlement and Thirty-Seventh Affirmative Defense of Breach of Settlement / Unilateral Mistake. The defendants have provided the required declarations and the court finds that the amended answer will not prejudice the plaintiffs. Therefore, the motion is granted and leave is given to file the First Amended Answer."
