And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses two motions: a motion to enforce a purported settlement agreement and a motion to bifurcate the trial. The court finds that the defendants failed to show that the court has the equitable power to enforce the settlement agreement, citing the doctrine of judicial estoppel. The court also finds that the settlement agreement is not enforceable on noticed motion because it was not signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court. The court grants the motion to bifurcate the trial into a liability phase and a punitive damages phase, citing the need for judicial efficiency and economy.
