MOTION
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY 
 
MOTION
FOR ORDER COMPELLING COMPLIANCE WITH PLAINTIFF’S AGREEMENT TO PRODUCE DOCUMENTS



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
Kristie Smith
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
On October 14, 2022, Plaintiff, Guillermo Rodriguez, filed this
action against Defendant, Kristie Smith, in her capacity as an individual, as
successor trustee of the Lou Cutell Trust, and as sole successor in interest to
the Estate of Lou Cutell.  Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant unduly influenced decedent Lou Cutell to remove
Plaintiff from receiving his inheritance under decedent’s trust.  Plaintiff is currently self-represented.[1]
 
On December 6, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to compel
Plaintiff’s further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One.  Defendant requested sanctions against Plaintiff.
 
On December 12, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to compel
Plaintiff’s compliance with his agreement to produce documents in response to
Defendant’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One (“RPD”), Nos. 1-6,
19-36, and 39-42.  Defendant’s motion
also seeks to compel a further response to RFP Nos. 7-18 and 38, and to compel
a response without objection or claim of privilege to RPD No. 37.  Defendant seeks sanctions against Plaintiff.
 
The motions are unopposed. [2]

II.        MOTION TO
COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO SPECIAL 
INTERROGATORIES
 
a.      
Legal Standard 
      
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, parties may
move for a further response to interrogatories where an answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete, an exercise of the option to produce
documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification
of those documents is inadequate, or where an objection is without merit or too
general.¿¿ 
 
            Notice of
the motions must be given within 45 days of service of the verified response,
otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further
response.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c).)¿ The motions must also be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (b).)¿¿¿ 
 
            Finally,
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345 requires that all motions or responses
involving further discovery contain a separate statement with the text of each
request, the response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons for
compelling further responses.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345, subd.
(a)(3).)¿¿¿ 
 
Monetary
Sanctions¿¿ 
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court to
impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which
includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial
justification making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿¿ 
 
            If
sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that
the notice specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought
and the type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points
and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the
amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿ 
 
            If the
court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made or opposed a motion to compel
responses to interrogatories or inspection demands, the court “shall impose a
monetary sanction . . . unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c),
2031.310, subd. (h).)¿¿¿  
 
b.     
 Discussion
 
Defendant seeks an order compelling a further response to
Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 11, 24, 26, and 28.  She argues that Plaintiff served evasive and
incomplete supplemental responses to foregoing interrogatories.  Upon review of Plaintiff’s responses, the
court agrees they are evasive and incomplete.
 
Accordingly, the motion to compel further responses to
Special Interrogatories, Nos. 11, 24, 26, and 28 is GRANTED.
 
Monetary Sanctions
 
Defendant requests sanctions against Plaintiff.  Given the Court has granted this motion,
sanctions are warranted.  Accordingly, sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff
in the amount of $790, consisting of two hours for the preparation of this
motion at defense counsel’s hourly rate.
 
III.       MOTION TO
COMPEL COMPLIANCE
 
a.        Legal Standards
 
Compel Compliance 
 
If a party filing a response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling under Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280 thereafter fails to permit the inspection, copying
testing, or sampling in accordance with that party’s statement of compliance,
the demanding party may move for an order compelling compliance.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (a).)¿¿¿ 
 
The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that
conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).)¿ Misuses of the discovery process include failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subd. (d).)¿¿¿ 
            
            Compel
Further Responses to Inspection Demands
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, parties may
move for a further response to inspection demands where an answer to a
particular demand is incomplete, a representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete or evasive, or where an objection is without merit or
too general.¿¿ 
 
            Notice of
the motions must be given within 45 days of service of the verified response,
otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further
response.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)¿ The motions must also be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (b)(2).)¿¿¿ 
 
            Finally,
Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345 requires that all motions or responses
involving further discovery contain a separate statement with the text of each
request, the response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons for
compelling further responses.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345, subd.
(a)(3).)¿¿¿ 
 
Compel Initial Responses to Discovery
 
If a party to whom inspection demands were directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order to compel
responses without objections.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §2031.300, subd. (b).)¿
Failure to timely serve responses waives objections to the requests.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., §2031.300, subd. (a).)¿¿¿¿ 
 
b.     
Discussion
 
            Defendant seeks
the following orders: (1) to compel Plaintiff’s compliance with his prior
agreement to produce documents responsive to RPD Nos. 1-6, 19-36, and 39-42, or
alternatively, provide a further response to clarify he does not possess any
documents responsive to the RPD; (2) to compel Plaintiff’s further response to RPD
Nos. 7-18; and (3) to compel Plaintiff’s initial response to RPD No. 37. 
 
            RPD Nos.
1-6, 19-36 and 39-42
 
            Defendant argues Plaintiff’s compliance must be compelled
because he identified responsive documents to these requests yet has not
produced any of them.  Alternatively, to
the extent Plaintiff does not have any responsive documents, Defendant argues
that Plaintiff’s responses are not code compliant.  After reviewing RPD Nos. 1-6, 19-36, and
39-42 and Plaintiff’s responses, the court agrees.  Plaintiff must produce the documents he
identified as responsive to these RPDs or supplement his response accordingly.
 
            RPD Nos.
7-18, and 38
 
            Defendant argues a further response is required to Nos. 7-18
and 38 because Plaintiff’s stated inability to comply with these RPDs is not
code compliant.  The court agrees.  Plaintiff’s responses do not “specify whether
the inability to comply is because the particular item or category has never
existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never
been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding
party.”  The responses are
incomplete.  A further response to RPD
Nos. 7-18 and 38 is warranted.  
 
            RPD No.
37
 
            Defendant seeks to compel Plaintiff’s response without
objection to RPD No. 37 because Plaintiff did not provide any response.  Defendant is correct.  Plaintiff failed to respond to this discovery
request.  Defendant is entitled to a
response.
 
Monetary Sanctions
 
Defendant requests sanctions against Plaintiff.  Given the Court has granted this motion,
sanctions are warranted.  Accordingly, sanctions are imposed against
Plaintiff in the amount of $790, consisting of two hours for the preparation of
this motion at defense counsel’s hourly rate.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The motion
to compel further responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 11, 24,
26, and 28 is Granted.  Plaintiff Guillermo
Rodriguez is ordered to provide further responses within 30 days of this order.
 
            The motion
to compel Plaintiff’s compliance with Request for Production of Documents, Nos.
1-6, 19-36, and 39-42, to compel Plaintiff’s further response to RPD Nos. 7-18
and 38, and to compel Plaintiff’s initial response to RPD No. 37 is
granted.  Plaintiff is ordered to produce
responsive documents or supplement his responses to Nos. 1-6, 19-36, and 39-42,
provide further responses Nos. 7-18 and 38, and to provide an initial response
to No. 37 within 30 days of this order. 
 
            The requests
for sanctions are granted.  Plaintiff is ordered
to pay sanctions for the two motions in the sum of $1,580, to be paid to Defendant,
by and through her counsel, within 30 days of this order.  
 
            Plaintiff
has not appeared for hearings on 1/04/24 and 1/22/24.  The Plaintiff failed to appear today as
well.  The court sets an order to show
cause (“OSC”) why this case should not be dismissed for Plaintiff’s failure to
prosecute pursuant to CCP section 583.410, 581(g). 
 
Clerk and Moving party are to give notice.
