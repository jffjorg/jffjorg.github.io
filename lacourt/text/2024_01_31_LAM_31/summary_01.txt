The plaintiff has failed to produce documents and responses to discovery requests, and the defendant has sought sanctions.

The judge has ordered the plaintiff to provide further responses to the special interrogatories within 30 days and to produce responsive documents or supplement his responses to the request for production of documents. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,580 to the defendant.

The judge has set an order to show cause (OSC) why the case should not be dismissed for the plaintiff's failure to prosecute. The OSC will be heard in the future.

The judge has also granted the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $790.
