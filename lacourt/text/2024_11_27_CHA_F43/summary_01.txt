And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion of Matthew C. Mullhofer, counsel for plaintiff Jan Salmudin, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed due to a complete breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and an unreconcilable breakdown in communications between the plaintiff and counsel. There is no showing of prejudice, and the motion complies with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. The judge cites People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406, which states that an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted absent a showing of resulting prejudice. The order is that the moving party (Matthew C. Mullhofer) shall give notice.
