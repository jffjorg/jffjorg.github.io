Shahinyan, et al.Trial Date: None set.MOTION TO STRIKEMOVING PARTY: Defendant Benjamin ShahinyanRESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff U.S. Bank Trust National AssociationRELIEF REQUESTEDStrike punitive damages against Defendant Shahinyan from the complaint.RULING: Motion is denied.SUMMARY OF ACTIONOn August 20, 2019, Beniamin Shahinyan secured a $548,000.00 loan on real property in Mission Hills, CA. The original lender assigned the Note and Deed of Trust to U.S. Bank Trust National Association. In April 2021, MTC Financial, Inc. was substituted in as the trustee under the Deed of Trust, and Shahinyan defaulted on the loan. Notices of default and trustee’s sale were filed, the property was sold, and a deed to that effect was recorded. Defendants then allegedly recorded notices rescinding those documents.On April 30, 2024, U.S. Bank filed this action against Shahinyan and MTC Financial Inc. alleging claims for cancellation of instrument and declaratory relief.On September 10, 2024, Shahinyan filed a motion to strike punitive damages from the complaint. U.S. Bank filed an opposition on November 12, 2024. No reply has been filed.Meet and ConferBefore filing a demurrer or motion to strike, the parties must meet and confer in person, telephonically, or by video conference. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, subd. (a), 435.5, subd. (a).)Although defendant did not file a meet and confer declaration, plaintiff does not raise it as an issue.ANALYSISShahinyan asks the Court to strike the following from the complaint:· Complaint, ¶ 23: “SHAHINYAN's acts alleged above were willful, wanton, malicious, and oppressive, and were undertaken with intent to defraud, and justify the awarding of exemplary and punitive damages.”· Complaint, page 7, lines 12-13: “5. For punitive damages against defendant, SHAHINYAN, in an amount according to proof.”As U.S. Bank points out, the complaint states in several places that it does not seek damages and nowhere are punitive damages mentioned. Although the Court recognizes Shahinyan is self-represented, the Court is as perplexed as U.S. Bank in understanding upon which document Shahinyan based this motion.Accordingly, the Court denies Shahinyan’s motion to strike.ORDERMoving party to give notice.
