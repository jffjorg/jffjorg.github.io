And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages from the complaint. The defendant, Benjamin Shahinyan, had asked the court to strike the claims for punitive damages from the complaint, citing that the complaint does not mention punitive damages. However, the judge noted that the complaint does not mention punitive damages at all, and therefore the motion is denied. The judge also did not raise the issue that the defendant did not file a meet and confer declaration, as required by law, prior to filing the motion to strike. The court's ruling is based on the information presented to it before the hearing date of November 27, 2024.
