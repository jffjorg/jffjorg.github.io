 Case Number:  23SMCV01663    Hearing Date:   April 12, 2024    Dept:  I The unopposed motion to compel responses to special
interrogatories is GRANTED.  The motion
to deem RFAs admitted is GRANTED, unless prior to the hearing responses were
served, in which case the motion is MOOT as to whether they will be deemed
admitted.  Verified, code-compliant
responses to the interrogatories and RFAs (to the extent that the motion to
deem admitted is moot) will be served within 5 court days.  If responses have already been served that
plaintiff believes are compliant, they need not be served again, but if they
are not compliant and a motion to compel is granted, the court will view that
as being in violation of this order. 
Sanctions are awarded in the amount of $645 for each of the two
motions.
