The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel responses in the case. The Judge has denied the motions, citing that the discovery was properly served, but the party to whom the discovery was directed has passed away. As a result, it is physically impossible for the plaintiff to respond to the discovery. The Judge has instructed the plaintiff's counsel to report back on the status of obtaining a representative or successor to take over the case. The Judge will inquire about the status of this development at the hearing on April 12, 2024.
