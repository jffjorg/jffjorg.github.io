And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion to compel further responses and production from the defendant, Rechnitz. The defendant has invoked the right against self-incrimination, but the judge is not satisfied with the defendant's showing. The judge believes that the defendant must provide more information to establish the privilege, such as a log or other form, to demonstrate the link between the responses and potential self-incrimination. The judge is willing to allow the defendant to file the opposition, but only as it was served, without amendment or change, and will reconvene the hearing. The judge also notes that the right against self-incrimination is not a proper objection, but rather a potentially proper response. The judge will review the opposition and set a new hearing date.
