And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the unopposed motion to compel responses to special interrogatories. The judge has also granted the motion to deem RFAs (Requests for Admission) admitted, unless responses were served prior to the hearing. The plaintiff must serve verified, code-compliant responses to the interrogatories and RFAs within 5 court days. If responses have already been served and are compliant, they do not need to be served again. However, if responses are not compliant and a motion to compel is granted, the court will view this as a violation of the order. Sanctions of $645 will be awarded for each of the two motions.
