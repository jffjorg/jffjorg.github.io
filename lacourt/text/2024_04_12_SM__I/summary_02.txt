And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has considered the motions to compel filed by the plaintiff and the opposition filed by the defendant. The defendant's excuse for missing the discovery deadlines was not satisfactory, and the court was unimpressed by the untimely opposition. Despite this, the court has reviewed the defendant's responses and is inclined to grant the motion to compel, requiring verified responses to be served within one court day. The court also awards sanctions in the amount of $10.00 per motion plus the $60.00 filing fee. The court notes that the plaintiff could have avoided the motion by contacting the defendant about the missing responses. The court is concerned that the plaintiff may be hindered in opposing the summary judgment motion due to the lack of discovery responses, and advises the plaintiff to consider this in their opposition.
