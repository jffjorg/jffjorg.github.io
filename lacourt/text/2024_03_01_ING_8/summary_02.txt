And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to amend the judgment to correct a typographical error. The error was discovered after the judgment was entered, and the plaintiffs filed the motion to amend the judgment. The judge found that the motion fell under the court's authority to correct a clerical error and its inherent power to supervise the execution of its orders. The judge ordered the correction of the error, changing the name "Ecletic Trading LLC" to the correct name "Eclectic Trading, LLC". The plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of the correction.
