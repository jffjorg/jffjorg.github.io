**Significant Statements**

* "To stamp a consent agreement with the judicial imprimatur, the court must determine the proposed settlement is just. . . . In the context of Proposition 65 litigation, necessarily brought to vindicate the public interest, the trial court also must ensure that its judgment serves the public interest."
* "The court must consider (1) the nature and extent of the violation, (2) the number and severity of the violations, (3) the economic effect of the penalty on the violator, (4) whether and when the violator took good faith measures to comply with regulations, (5) the willfulness of the violator’s misconduct, (6) the deterrent effect on the violator and the regulated community as a whole, and (7) “[a]ny other factor that justice may require.”
