I. BACKGROUND¿ 
¿ 
A. Factual¿ 
¿¿ 
            On November 21, 2023, this Court
entered judgment by default against Defendants, Mustafa
Mahmut Ay and Eclectic Trading LLC in the amount of $149,435. However,
Plaintiffs note that after judgment was entered, they discovered a
typographical error in 5a of the Judgment as the Defendant, Eclectic Trading
LLC was incorrectly misspelled. 
 
            As
such, Plaintiffs have brought this Motion to Amend Judgement to correct said
error. 
 
B. Procedural  
 
On
January 30, 2024, Plaintiffs filed this Motion to Amend Judgment. To date, no
opposition has been filed.  
 
II. ANALYSIS ¿ 
¿ 
A.   
Legal Standard 
 
“The court
may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a
party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out they name
of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake
in any other respect. . .The court may likewise, in its discretion, after
notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any terms as my be just, an amendment
to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars. . .” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§473, subd. (a)(1).) The court, “regardless of the lapse of time, has inherent
power to correct mistakes in its judgments or orders. [citation] This power,
however, is limited to mistakes which are not the result of an exercise of
judicial discretion.” (In re Sloan’s Estate (1963) 222 Cal.App.2d 283,
292.)  
B.   
Discussion 
Here,
Plaintiffs’ request falls under the court’s authority to correct a clerical
error and its “inherent power to supervise the execution of its orders, and
even modify them in ways affecting only the details of their performance.” (Vallelunga
v. Gomez (1951) 102 Cal.App.2d 374, 382 [internal quotations omitted].)  Accordingly ,the court grants
motion to amend the name of the judgment in 5a from “Ecletic Trading LLC” to
the correct name: “Eclectic Trading, LLC”. 
III. 
CONCLUSION¿ 
 
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’
Motion to Amend Judgment is GRANTED.   
 
            Plaintiffs are ordered to give
notice.
