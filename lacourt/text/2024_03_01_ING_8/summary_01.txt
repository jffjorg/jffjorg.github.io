And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions. The motion was brought in response to a letter sent by Plaintiff's counsel stating that they would put an end to Defendant's actions through the lawsuit and other means. The judge found that the letter was not an "action or tactic" subject to sanctions under California Code of Civil Procedure § 128.5. The judge also found that Plaintiff's claim against Defendant was not frivolous and that Defendant had not shown that Plaintiff's conduct in asserting the claim was objectively unreasonable.

The judge noted that the inclusion of five words found in the Complaint, and not required by any of the causes of action, or even plead as its own cause of action, was not grounds for termination of the entire Complaint. The judge also stated that a dispositive motion or some other evidentiary hearing such as a trial is the time to test whether allegations have factual support, and that a sanctions motion is not the time or place for the Court to make determinations as to whether an allegation in a Complaint is false, fraudulent, or mistaken.

Finally, the judge ordered Plaintiff to give notice of the ruling and denied Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions.
