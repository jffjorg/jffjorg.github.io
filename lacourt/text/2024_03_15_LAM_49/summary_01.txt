Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying Defendant Gregory Naiman's motion for summary judgment, which sought to dismiss all claims against him. The case involves a contract dispute between Ebasco Trading Corporation and Gregory Naiman's companies, Canvas Specialty, Inc. and U.S. Cover, regarding the procurement of an outdoor canopy for the U.S. Embassy in Liberia.

The judge found that Gregory Naiman's companies were undercapitalized and that he had commingled funds and assets with the companies. The judge also found that Gregory Naiman had failed to follow corporate formalities and had treated the companies' assets as his own.

As a result, the judge denied Gregory Naiman's motion for summary judgment and allowed all claims against him to proceed. The judge also ordered Plaintiff to give notice, unless waived.

The judge's decision is based on the evidence presented, including documents and testimony, and is guided by California law and relevant case precedent. The judge's ruling is tentative, meaning that it is subject to change after further consideration and argument at the hearing scheduled for March 15, 2024.
