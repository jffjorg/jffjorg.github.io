  Case Number:  23TRCV00029    Hearing Date:   August 15, 2024    Dept:  B Christy Andrews v. City of Lomita, Case No. 23TRCV00029
Defendant/Cross-Complainant City of Torrance has filed an
unopposed motion seeking:
(1) an order to continue the trial date of October 30, 2024
approximately 90 days to January 29, 2025 or to a date convenient to the
Court’s calendar, so that COT’s timely filed Motion for Summary Judgment, or in
the Alternative, for Summary Adjudication (MSJ) can be heard at least 30 days
prior to the trial date;
(2) an order to continue the Final Status Conference set for
October 23, 2024 to January 22, 2025 or to a date convenient to the Court’s
calendar; and
(3) an order that all related pre-trial and trial deadlines
are continued in accordance with the new trial date.
The Court desires to confer with all the parties to
establish a new schedule that allows for the hearing on the Motion for Summary
judgment, etc. and the trial, without compressing the timeline and placing
additional burdens on the parties and counsel.
It is hoped that the parties can confer prior to the hearing
of this motion and suggest such a timeline for the further prosecution of this
case through to trial.
