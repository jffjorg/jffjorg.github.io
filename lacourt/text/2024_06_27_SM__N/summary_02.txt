And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Plaintiff Charlene McPherson's motion for leave to amend to file a First Amended Complaint. The Judge found that the motion failed to meet the procedural requirements set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, including the requirement to provide specific page and line references for the proposed changes. The Judge also noted that the Plaintiff did not identify the new causes of action and did not provide any specific information about the proposed amendments. The Judge stated that the Court cannot determine the effect and necessity of the amendment without the required information. The Judge advised the Plaintiff to become familiar with the procedural requirements and may file another motion for leave to amend if she chooses.
