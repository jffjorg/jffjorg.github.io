The court found that the arbitration agreement signed by the plaintiff permits arbitration of the individual claims, and that the arbitrator rather than the court should decide whether the agreement permits class arbitration. The court has stayed the lawsuit pending the outcome of the arbitration. The post-arbitration status conference is set for September 11, 2024.
