  Case Number:  20STCV29734    Hearing Date:   April 11, 2024    Dept:  17 [TENTATIVE]
ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO APPROVE PAGA SETTLEMENTI.                  
INTRODUCTION
            On August 4, 2020, Vahik Nazarpour filed a class and
representative action against Gorgee Enterprises, Inc., Gabriel Transit, Inc.,
Access Services Incorporated, Timmy Mardirosian, and Petros Keshishian alleging
drivers were improperly classified as independent contractors.  The complaint
alleges 12 causes of action for: (1) misclassification as independent
contractor (Lab. Code, §¿226.8);1 (2) failure to pay all wages due (§¿1194); (3)
failure to pay minimum wage (§¿1194); (4) failure to pay overtime compensation
(§§¿510, 1194); (5) failure to provide meal periods (§§¿512, 226.7); (6)
failure to provide rest periods (§§¿512, 226.7); (7) failure to provide
accurate itemized wage statements (§¿226); (8) waiting time penalties
(§§¿201-203); (9) illegal deductions (§¿221, 224); (10) failure to reimburse
business expenses (§¿2802); (11) unfair business practices (Bus. & Prof.
Code, §¿17200 et seq.); and (12) civil penalties under the Private Attorneys
General Act (PAGA) (§¿2698 et seq.)
On February 25, 2022, Plaintiff moved to certify a class of taxi
drivers allegedly misclassified as independent contractors by Defendants.  On
November 17, 2022 the Court denied Plaintiff's motion for class certification.  On September 13, 2023, the parties mediated
and reached a full settlement of Plaintiff’s individual claims, including his
individual PAGA claim.  On October 17,
2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement of Entire Case.  
On
December 11, 2023 Plaintiff filed a Motion for Approval of PAGA
Settlement.  On January 23, 2024
Plaintiff's motion was denied without prejudice for two reasons: (1) the
proposed settlement had not been submitted to the court or the LWDA and (2)
Plaintiff purported to settle only individual PAGA claims.  On March 19, 2024 Plaintiff filed this
renewed Motion for Approval of PAGA Settlement.
Labor
Code section 2699, subdivision (l)(2) states the “superior court shall
review and approve any settlement of any civil action filed pursuant to
this part [i.e., PAGA].  The proposed
settlement shall be submitted to the agency [i.e., the LWDA] at the same time
that it is submitted to the court.”  The
court reviews “whether [the settlement] is fair, reasonable, and adequate in
view of PAGA's purposes to remediate present labor law violations, deter future
ones, and to maximize enforcement of state labor laws.”  (Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021) 72
Cal.App.5th 56, 77. )
II.              
SETTLEMENT TERMS
Plaintiff
attaches the written settlement agreement to the Declaration of Frank E.
Marchetti.  Marchetti declares that the settlement
agreement and Motion to Approve were submitted to the LWDA on March 18 and 19,
2024.  (Marchetti Dec. ¶ 18.) 
The settlement
agreement includes a release of “all claims, transactions, or occurrences that
occurred during the PAGA Period, including, but not limited to: (a) all claims
that were, or reasonably could have been, alleged, based on the facts contained
in the Complaint in the Action and the PAGA Notice,” but expressly not
including any claims relating to the settlement, claims “based on occurrences
outside the PAGA Period,” or claims pursuant to PAGA brought by any other
person.  (Marchetti Decl., Ex. A at ¶ V.1.)  
Defendant
agreed to pay $7,500 in exchange for this release.  From this sum the agreement provides for
attorney's fees of "not more than 40% which is currently estimated to be
$3,000" and distribution of 75% of the remaining $4,500 in funds to the
LWDA ($3,375) and 25% to Plaintiff ($1,125). 
(Id. at ¶ III.)  Defendant
agreed to disburse the funds to Plaintiff’s counsel after entry of final
judgment approving the Settlement.  (Id.
at ¶ IV.1, ¶ I.5.)  At that time Plaintiff’s
counsel “shall issue payments for the Individual PAGA Payment, the LWDA PAGA
Payment, and the PAGA Counsel Expenses Payment,” provided that counsel’s
expense payment “shall not precede disbursement of Individual PAGA Payments.”  (Id. at ¶ IV.2.)  The release is effective upon the funding of
the settlement.  (Id. at ¶ V.)
III.           
ANALYSIS
The release
expressly does not extend to PAGA claims asserted by or on behalf of aggrieved
employees other than Plaintiff.  (Marchetti
Decl., Ex. A at ¶ V.1).  Moreover, with
respect to his individual PAGA claim, Plaintiff complied with PAGA by
allocating a portion of the penalty to the LWDA and providing it notice.  The LWDA made no objection to the settlement.
Plaintiff’s
counsel seeks $3,000 in fees and litigation costs, which is 40% of the settlement
fund.  Counsel declares his regular rate
is $600 per hour and he spent at least 215 hours on the case..  (Marchetti Dec., ¶ 17.)  The $3,000 in fees and costs sought represent a tiny fraction
of the costs advanced by counsel ($23,000) and value of the over 200 hours of
work in this action ($129,000).  (Marchetti
Dec. ¶ 17.)  The recovery is fair and
reasonable.  
IV.           
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
The
Motion for Approval is GRANTED.
Plaintiff
shall file a [Proposed] Judgment Approving the PAGA Settlement within 10 days
of this Order.  
Plaintiff
shall give the LWDA notice of this Order and of the Judgment once filed.
