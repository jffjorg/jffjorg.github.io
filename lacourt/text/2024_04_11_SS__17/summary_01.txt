The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to approve the PAGA settlement. The settlement agreement includes a release of all claims related to the PAGA period, with the exception of claims relating to the settlement itself or claims brought by other persons. The defendant agreed to pay $7,500 in exchange for the release. The settlement also provides for the distribution of funds to the LWDA and the plaintiff. The court has also approved the allocation of 40% of the settlement fund to counsel's fees and litigation costs. The court has found that the recovery is fair and reasonable. The plaintiff is directed to file a proposed judgment approving the PAGA settlement within 10 days of the order.
