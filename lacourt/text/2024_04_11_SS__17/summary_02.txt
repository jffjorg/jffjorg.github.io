Here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to seal certain exhibits related to tax returns. The court finds that the defendants have an overriding interest in the privacy of sensitive personal financial information in the tax returns, which would be prejudiced by leaving the returns in the public record. The proposed sealing is narrowed to the tax returns, and redaction is deemed infeasible due to the volume of sensitive information. The court orders that the record be filed under seal.
