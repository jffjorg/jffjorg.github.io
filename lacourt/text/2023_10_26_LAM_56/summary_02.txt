  The defendants did not meet the safe harbor provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5 and 128.7 because the motion they served on September 1, 2023, differs from the motion they filed on October 4, 2023.
  The court finds that the motion is therefore MOOT.

The defendants moved for sanctions and dismissal of the action, alleging that the complaint was filed for an improper purpose and was frivolous.

Therefore, the court finds that the motion is MOOT.
