And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to uphold confidentiality designations. The motion was filed by the defendant, The Board of Trustees of the California State University, to maintain the confidentiality of excerpts from the transcript of the deposition of Diane Fazzi. The plaintiff, Patrick Krug, opposes the motion, arguing that the information is public and should be disclosed.

The judge has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers and has ruled in favor of the defendant. The judge finds that the transcript excerpts concern private personnel record information and are therefore confidential. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has not shown a compelling need to disclose the information and that the information can be obtained through less intrusive means.

The judge grants the motion to uphold confidentiality designations and orders that the excerpts lodged under seal as Exhibit D of Defendant's moving papers shall remain under seal. The judge also orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling.
