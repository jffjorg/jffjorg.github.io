And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for trial preference filed by the minor plaintiffs (Edgar Iniguez, Jr. and Alennry Iniquez) under CCP ยง36(b). The minor plaintiffs, who were passengers in their father's vehicle at the time of the accident, suffered injuries and emotional distress as a result of the accident. The court finds that the minor plaintiffs have a substantial interest in the case as a whole and therefore, the trial court has no discretion to refuse their request for early setting. The defendant's opposition to the motion for trial preference is denied.
