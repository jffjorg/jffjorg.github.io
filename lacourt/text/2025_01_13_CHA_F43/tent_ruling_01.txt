SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
November 5, 2021, Plaintiff Ahmed El Masri (Plaintiff) and defendant Alexandra
Mixon were involved in a two-vehicle collision when Mixon turned left out of a
parking lot and collided with Plaintiff who was driving his motorcycle. Plaintiff
filed this action against Mixon, City of Los Angeles, Northridge Business
Centre Owners Association (Northridge), Teairra Marchinee, and Does 1 to 100.  Plaintiff amended his complaint to add the
Emmons Company (Emmons Co.) as Doe 26. 
The complaint alleges a premises liability cause of action against
Northridge and Emmons Co.  Emmons Co.
filed an answer which included a Proposition 213 affirmative defense.
 
On
August 27, 2024, the Court granted Emmons Co.’s motion to deem its Request for
Admissions, Set One admitted by Plaintiff. 
(08/27/2024 - Minute Order.)
 
On
October 16, 2024, Emmons Co. and Northridge filed this motion for summary
judgment on the complaint’s premises liability claim and summary adjudication on
Emmons Co.’s Proposition 213 affirmative defense.
 
No
opposition has been filed.
 
SUMMARY
OF ARGUMENTS
Emmons
Co. and Northridge move for summary judgment on the second cause of action for
premises liability.  They argue that
Emmons Co.’s Requests for Admission, Set One, which the Court deemed admitted
for their truth, show that Plaintiff cannot present evidence to prove Emmons
Co. and Northridge breached a duty of care and caused Plaintiff’s
injuries.  Further, Northridge and Emmons
Co. argue that summary adjudication should be granted on Emmons Co.’s twenty
affirmative defense under Proposition 213 because Plaintiff admits he was
driving an uninsured motorcycle he owns during the accident.
 
Plaintiff
does not oppose.
 
The Complaint’s Allegations Concerning
Premises Liability
Plaintiff alleges that on November 5, 2021, he was
riding his motorcycle westbound on Nordhoff Street, near Oakdale Ave, a public
roadway.  (Compl., ¶¶ 11-12.)  Defendant Mixon was attempting to exit a
parking lot by turning left onto eastbound Nordhoff Street.  (Compl., ¶ 11.)  The parking pot is located on private
property owned and operated by Northridge and Emmons Co. (Compl., ¶ 13.)  Plaintiff could not avoid Mixon’s vehicle
causing Plaintiff to be directly broadsided. 
(Compl., ¶ 11.)
 
Plaintiff further alleges the existence of a “Special
Relationship” between himself and Northridge and Emmons Co.  (Compl., ¶ 31.)  Plaintiff alleges that the Northridge and
Emmons Co. owned, leased, occupied, controlled, designed, constructed,
operated, maintained, and managed what he identifies as the parking lot and the
adjacent public roadway, for the purpose of operating a parking business.  (Compl., ¶ 32.)  Because of this “Special Relationship”,
Northridge and Emmons Co. owed Plaintiff, a reasonably foreseeable person, a
duty of care to provide a reasonably safe environment for vehicles exiting the
parking lot.  (Compl., ¶ 33.)  Plaintiff further alleges that Northridge and
Emmons Co. breached their duty to him by failing to reasonably design,
construct, operate, inspect, maintain, manage, supervise, or control the parking
lot and the adjacent public roadway. 
(Compl., ¶ 37.)  Finally, Plaintiff
alleges this breach proximately caused his injuries.  (Compl., ¶¶ 38-43.)
 
ANALYSIS
The
purpose of a motion for summary judgment “is to provide courts with a mechanism
to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite
their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.”  (Aguilar
v. Atl. Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 437c,
subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)
 
The pleadings frame the issues for motions, “since it is those
allegations to which the motion must respond. (Citation.)” (Scolinos v. Kolts (1995) 37 Cal. App.
4th 635, 640-641; FPI Development, Inc.
v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 382-383; Jordan-Lyon Prods., LTD. v. Cineplex Odeon Corp. (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1459, 1472.) “On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden
is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) 
 
A
defendant moving for summary judgment “has met his or her burden of showing
that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more
elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)  The defendant may present evidence that “the
plaintiff does not possess, and cannot reasonably obtain, needed evidence—as
through admissions by the plaintiff following extensive discovery[.]”  (Nicoletti v. Kest (2023) 97
Cal.App.5th 140, 144.)  “Once the
defendant . . . has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . .
to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the
cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)
 
“When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the
court must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except
evidence to which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all
reasonable inference that may be drawn from that evidence, in the light most
favorable to the party opposing summary judgment.”  (Avivi
v. Centro Medico Urgent Medical Ctr. (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467;
see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) “An issue of fact can only be
created by a conflict in the evidence. 
It is not created by speculation, conjecture, imagination or guesswork.”
 (Lyons
v. Security Pacific National Bank (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1001, 1041 [citation
omitted].)
 
            Second
Cause of Action - Premises Liability
Northridge and Emmons move for summary judgment on the
second cause of action because Plaintiff cannot establish that Northridge and
Emmons Co. were negligent in the use and maintenance of the parking lot and
that the alleged negligence was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s
harm.  Northridge and Emmons Co. present
evidentiary support from their Requests for Admission, Set One, which the Court
deemed admitted for their truth in its August 27, 2024 Minute Order.  (08/27/2024 - Minute Order.)
 
Courts may consider requests for admission in
deciding a motion for summary judgment. 
(Barnett v. American-Cal Medical Services (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d
260, 266.)  The purpose of requests for
admission is to limit triable issues by eliminating the need to prove
undisputed facts at trial.  (St. Mary
v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 775.)  Any matter admitted by a party or deemed
admitted by court order is conclusively established against the party making
the admission. (Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 978-979.)
 
The
elements of a premises liability claim are that (1) defendant owned, leased,
occupied, or controlled the subject property; (2) defendant negligently used
and maintained the property; (3) plaintiff was harmed; and 4) defendant’s
negligence was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff’s harm.  (CACI No. 1001; Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp
(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998 [listing duty of care, breach, and proximate
cause resulting in injury]; see also Civ. Code, § 1714 subd. (a).) 
 
Northridge
and Emmons Co. argue Plaintiff has not and cannot establish elements two and
four.
 
Issue No. 1 - Northridge and Emmons Co.
did not breach a duty of care to Plaintiff
“The
owner of premises is under a duty to exercise ordinary care in the management
of such premises in order to avoid exposing persons to an unreasonable risk of
harm. A failure to fulfill this duty is negligence.” (Brooks v. Eugene
Burger Management Corp. (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1611, 1619.)  This duty of care encompasses a duty to avoid
exposing persons to risks of injury offsite if the property was maintained so
as to expose persons to an unreasonable risk of injury offsite.  (Garcia
v. Paramount Citrus Ass’n, Inc. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1448, 1453.)  Exceptions can exist where defendant
controlled property that abuts a public street, thereby creating a dangerous
condition.  (Vasilenko v. Grace Family
Church (2017) 3 Cal.5th 1077, 1093.)
 
Northridge and Emmons Co. argue the undisputed
material facts show Northridge and Emmons Co. did not have a special
relationship with Plaintiff.  Plaintiff
admits Northridge and Emmons Co. are not responsible for the incident.  (UMF No. 1, Exh. A - RFA Nos. 6, 22.)  Plaintiff cannot produce admissible evidence
showing he had a “Special Relationship” with Northridge and Emmons Co.  (UMF No. 2.)
 
Plaintiff does not present opposing arguments or
rebutting evidence.
 
Northridge and Emmons Co. argue the undisputed
material facts show Northridge and Emmons Co. did not owe Plaintiff a duty of
care.  Plaintiff presents no evidence
that Northridge and Emmons Co. breached a duty of care to Plaintiff regarding
the collision or failed to use reasonable care with regard to the parking lot
prior to or at the time of the collision. 
(UMF Nos. 2, 3.)
 
The Court finds the undisputed material facts show
Northridge and Emmons Co. did not have a special relationship with Plaintiff
that gives rise to a duty of care. 
Further, Plaintiff the evidence does not show that Northridge and Emmons
Co. breached a duty of care to Plaintiff.
 
Issue Nos. 2 & 4 - Plaintiff cannot can
produce evidence that a dangerous condition existed at the parking lot or the
location where the alleged incident occurred, and that Northridge and Emmons
Co. had actual or constructive knowledge of any dangerous condition.
A dangerous condition is one that creates a
substantial risk of injury even when used in a reasonably foreseeable
manner.  (See CACI Nos. 1000, 1003.)  “Because the owner is not the insurer of the
visitor’s personal safety [citation], the owner’s actual or constructive
knowledge of the dangerous condition is a key to establishing its liability. .
. . [T]he owner or occupier ‘must have either actual or constructive knowledge
of the dangerous condition or have been able by the exercise of ordinary care
to discover the condition, which if known to him, he should realize as
involving an unreasonable risk to invitees on his premises[.]’” (Gonzalez
v. Interstate Cleaning Corp. (2024) 106 Cal.App.5th 1026, 327 Cal.Rptr.3d
530, 537 [quoting Ortega v. Kmart Corp. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1200,
1206.].)  Constructive notice exists
where the owner has “actual notice of facts or circumstances which are
sufficient to put a prudent person on inquiry as to the existence of the fact
[of the dangerous condition].”  (Nicholson
v. Los Angeles (1936) 5 Cal.2d 361, 364, 54 P.2d 725.)  “Therefore, a landowner cannot be charged
with constructive notice without a showing of some overt feature surrounding
the dangerous condition, which would notify the landowner of its existence.  (Citation.)” 
(Jones v. Awad (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 1200, 1209.)
 
Northridge and Emmons Co. argue the undisputed
material facts show that no dangerous condition existed on the Subject Property
or on the public roadway where the alleged incident occurred.  Plaintiff admits Northridge and Emmons Co.
were not negligent regarding the collision. 
(UMF No. 4, RFA Nos. - 8, 23.)  Plaintiff
cannot produce admissible evidence that the Parking Lot was in a dangerous
condition or presented an unreasonable risk of harm to Plaintiff prior to or at
the time of the Incident.  (UMF No.
5.)  
 
Plaintiff does not present opposing arguments or
rebutting evidence.
 
The Court finds the undisputed material facts show
that no dangerous condition existed on Northridge and Emmons Co.’s property
during the alleged incident.  The
undisputed facts also show that Northridge and Emmons Co. did not have actual
or constructive knowledge of a dangerous condition on the parking lot or the
adjacent public roadway where the alleged incident occurred.
 
Issue No. 3: Plaintiff cannot produce
evidence that the Northridge Defendants’ conduct was a substantial factor in
causing her alleged injuries. 
To prove a defendant’s negligence was a substantial
factor in causing plaintiff’s injuries, plaintiff must show some substantial
link or nexuses between the act and plaintiff’s injury.  (Saelzler v. Advanced Group 400 (2001)
25 Cal.4th 763, 779.)  Plaintiff must
establish this element through “nonspeculative evidence.”  (Id. at p. 774.) 
 
Northridge and Emmons Co. argue that the undisputed
material facts show that no act or omission by Northridge and Emmons Co. was a
substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s alleged injuries.  (UMF No. 6.) 
Plaintiff admits Northridge and Emmons Co.’s alleged negligence did not
cause the incident.  (UMF Nos. 7, Exh. A
- RFA Nos. 7, 22.)  Plaintiff admits both
he and defendant Mixon were the cause of the incident, were at fault for the
incident, and were each one hundred percent (100%) responsible for the incident.  (UMF No. 6, Exh. A - RFA Nos. 1-3,
9-11.)  Northridge and Emmons Co. also
state designing the parking lot for purposes of exiting onto the public roadway
was not a cause of the incident.  (UMF
No. 8.)  Permitting defendant Mixon to
travel directly southbound onto the public roadway from the parking lot was not
a cause of the alleged incident.  (UMF
No. 8.)  Plaintiff admits defendant Mixon
stopped at the Nordhoff Street before entering Nordhoff Street from the parking
lot.  (Exh. A - RFA No. 5.)
 
Plaintiff does not present opposing arguments or
rebutting evidence.
 
The Court finds the undisputed material facts show
that no negligent acts or omission by Northridge and Emmons Co. was a
substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s injuries.
 
Accordingly, Northridge and Emmons Co. are entitled
to judgment as a matter of law.
 
Because Plaintiff fails to establish the negligence
and causation prongs of his premises liability claim, the Court grants
Northridge and Emmons Co.’s motion for summary judgment.
 
Affirmative Defense - Proposition 213
bars Plaintiff’s right to recover non-economic damages.
In the alternative, Northridge and Emmons Co. move
for summary adjudication on Emmons Co.’s affirmative defense under Proposition
213.  They argue that the undisputed
material facts show Plaintiff was uninsured while he drove his uninsured
motorcycle during the alleged incident. 
As a matter of law, Plaintiff is barred from collecting non-economic
damages.  
 
Proposition 213, also known as Personal
Responsibility Act of 1996, was enacted to restrict the ability of uninsured
drivers to sue for losses suffered in accidents and ensure that those “who fail
to take essential personal responsibility” would not be awarded for
“irresponsibility and law breaking.”  (Day
v. City of Fontana (2001) 25 Cal.4th 268, 274-275; Civ. Code, § 3333.4.)  Proposition 213 bars recovery of non-economic
and nonpecuniary damages for a person injured in a motor vehicle accident, if
the person  was an uninsured owner or
operator of a vehicle involved in accident. 
(Civ. Code, § 3333.4, subd. (a).) 

 
Issue # 5 – Plaintiff admits he violated Proposition
213 and Vehicle Code section 22350.
 
Northridge and Emmons Co. argue the undisputed
material facts show Plaintiff was not insured during the incident and his
motorcycle was not insured.  (UMF No. 16,
Exh. A - RFA Nos. 12, 14.)  Plaintiff
admits that Civil Code section 3333.4 applies to his damages as result of the
incident.  (RFA No.14.)  Plaintiff admits he violated Vehicle Code
section 22350 which prohibits drivers from driving “at a speed greater than is
reasonable or prudent.”  (RFA No. 12;
Veh. Code, § 22350.)
 
Plaintiff does not present opposing evidence.
 
The Court finds that based on Plaintiff’s admissions,
no dispute of material fact exists regarding whether Plaintiff violated sections
3333.4 and 22350.  Thus, Northridge and
Emmons Co. and entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
 
Because Plaintiff violated Proposition 213, Plaintiff
is not entitled to recover non-economic and nonpecuniary damages.
 
Accordingly, the Court grants summary adjudication
for Northridge and Emmons Co. based on Emmons Co.’s twenty-fifth affirmative
defense under Proposition 213.
 
CONCLUSION
The motion for summary judgment is granted for the
second cause of action.  Summary
adjudication is granted for the Emmons Co.’s twenty-fifth affirmative defense
under Proposition 213.
 
Northridge and Emmons Co. to give notice.
