And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer is overruled and the motion to strike is denied. The plaintiff, Hector Casimiro Bojorquez Solares, has alleged that the defendant, Right Size Plumbing & Drain Co., Inc. dba Tip Top Drain Pro, wrongfully terminated his employment as a manual laborer. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant failed to provide reasonable accommodations for his disability, retaliated against him for his complaints about wage-and-hour violations, and harassed and discriminated against him.

The judge has found that the plaintiff has adequately pled his claims for harassment, discrimination, retaliation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge has also found that the defendant's arguments that the plaintiff's claims are barred by statute are without merit.

The judge has denied the defendant's request for judicial notice of a fictitious business name statement and has found that the defendant is properly named and served in the case.

The judge has ordered the defendant to file an answer within 20 days.
