And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Mural Media's motion to compel Plaintiff Linda J. Maultsby to provide written and verified responses with no objections, and to produce documents, in full compliance with the California Discovery Act. Maultsby failed to serve any responses to Mural Media's document requests, even after the deadline to do so expired. The Judge orders Maultsby to serve the responses and produce documents by December 6, 2023, and to pay discovery sanctions in the sum of $2,040.00 to Mural Media. The Judge finds that Maultsby's failure to comply with the discovery requests lacks substantial justification.
