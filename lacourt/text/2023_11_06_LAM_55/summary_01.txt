And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to reclassify the case as limited is denied. The plaintiff, Bret Martin Zajac, alleges emotional distress damages from FEHA violations and unsafe working conditions. The defendant, Rolling Green Nursery, Inc., contends that Zajac has no supporting evidence of emotional distress damages and that he will not be able to obtain damages of at least $25,000. The court finds that the allegations in the complaint adequately allege emotional distress damages that potentially could exceed $25,000, and that Zajac's discovery responses provide some detail about the alleged injuries. Therefore, the court cannot conclude that there is a legal certainty that Zajac's damages will fall below $25,000. The court also denies the defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiff.
