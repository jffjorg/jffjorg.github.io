 Case Number:  23STCV07896    Hearing Date:   November 6, 2023    Dept:  55   Defendant Mural Media, LLC 401k Plan (“Mural Media”) moves to compel Plaintiff Linda J. Maultsby (“Maultsby”) to provide responses to Mural Media’s Requests for Production, Set One, and for sanctions. Maultsby does not oppose the motion.  Mural Media established that Maultsby failed to serve any responses to Mural Media’s document requests, even after the deadline to do so expired. (Mot., Stoltzman Decl., Ex. 1.) The Court therefore grants Mural Media’s motion pursuant to CCP § 2031.300   On or before 12/6/23, Maultsby shall serve written and verified responses with no objections, and produce documents, in full compliance with the California Discovery Act, CCP §2016.010 et seq., as to Mural Media’s Requests for Production, Set One.  On or before that same date, Maultsby shall pay discovery sanctions in the sum of $2,040.00 to Mural Media, the Court finding the absence of substantial justification.    E.g., CCP   § 2023.030.
