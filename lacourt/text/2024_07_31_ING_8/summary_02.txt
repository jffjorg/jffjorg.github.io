Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer filed by Defendant Marjan Chegounchi, M.D. to the complaint filed by Plaintiff Laderra Von Turner-Sweed. The demurrer argued that the complaint fails to state a cause of action against Defendant for wrongful death sounding in constructive fraud. The court found that Defendant attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff's counsel prior to filing the demurrer, and that the PREP Act provides immunity to Defendant for any claims arising from the administration of Remdesivir. The court further found that Plaintiff's claims are not barred by the PREP Act, but that Plaintiff's complaint does not plead willful misconduct, which is an exception to the PREP Act's immunity. Therefore, the court sustained the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend.
