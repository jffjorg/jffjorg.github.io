And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge finds that Werbin's conflict is imputed to DTLA Law Group, but that the firm has implemented an ethical wall and software firewall that may prevent the sharing of confidential information. The judge notes that Werbin's knowledge of Defendant's "litigation strategies, case handling procedures, attorney-client communications, confidential and proprietary information concerning Costco's operations, confidential client documentation, policies and procedures, and trade secrets" are confidential and material to this and other bodily injury cases filed against Costco in Southern California arising from premises liability claims in a Costco store or parking lot.

The judge concludes that Werbin himself would be disqualified from representing Plaintiff in this matter, but that the DTLA Law Group has implemented measures to prevent the sharing of confidential information and may have rebutted the presumption of vicarious knowledge. The judge sets forth various elements of an effective ethical wall, including physical and departmental separation of attorneys, prohibitions against and sanctions for discussing confidential matters, established rules and procedures preventing access to confidential information and files, procedures preventing a disqualified attorney from sharing in the profits from the representation, and continuing education in professional responsibility.

The judge notes that DTLA Law Group's implementation of its new software and file management system was after an adverse court ruling on a prior disqualification motion in 2021, and that prior to that, all client files were viewable by all DTLA Law employees. The judge expresses concern that DTLA Law Group neglected to mention the prior adverse ruling and its trigger to impose safeguards, which is troubling in a case where the firm's and Werbin's ethical strictures are the focus of the pending motion.
