 Case Number:  23STCV22032    Hearing Date:   January 3, 2025    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78 ¿ SHEILA ELIZABETH MERRILL, Plaintiff(s), vs. KKR INVESTMENT PROPERTIES, et al., Defendant(s). Case No.:¿ 23STCV22032 Hearing Date: January 3, 2025   [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S UNOPPOSED MOTION TO COMPEL PLAINTIFF’S DEPOSITION  I. BACKGROUND On May 28, 2024, defendant KKR Investment Properties (“Defendant”) filed a motion to compel the deposition of plaintiff Sheila Elizabeth Merrill (“Plaintiff”). The motion was heard on August 9, 2024. The Court noted that Plaintiff was in pro per as of June 10, 2024, and that Defendant’s declaration at the time failed to state whether its counsel contacted Plaintiff to inquire about her nonappearance pursuant to CCP § 2025.450(b)(2). The Court denied the motion, but without prejudice as to Defendant re-filing the motion with the required meet and confer declaration. (Min. Order, Aug. 9, 2024.) On September 12, 2024, Defendant re-filed the motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition. Defendant avers that on August 9, 2024, it served a notice of deposition on Plaintiff setting the deposition for August 26, 2024 and a letter requesting alternative dates should Plaintiff be unavailable. (Kaufman Decl. ¶ 11; Exhs. A and B.) Plaintiff never responded to the deposition notice and letter, nor did she respond to Defendant counsel’s email on August 22, 2024 to confirm the deposition. (Kaufman Decl. ¶¶ 11-12; Exh. C.) Plaintiff failed to appear on August 26, 2024 and Defendant obtained a certificate of nonappearance. (Kaufman Decl. ¶ 13; Ex. D.) Thereafter, Defendant’s counsel called Plaintiff to meet and confer, but the recording stated that the person was not accepting calls. (Kaufman Decl. ¶ 14.) Defendant sent another meet and confer letter on August 26, 2024. (Kaufman Decl. ¶ 15.) To date, Plaintiff has not responded to any of Defendant’s counsel’s correspondences. (Kaufman Decl. ¶ 16.) As of December 19, 2024, no opposition has been filed.  II. PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENT A motion to compel deposition “shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.” (CCP § 2025.450(b)(2).) The Court finds that Defendant has met this requirement on the renewed motion.  III. DISCUSSION CCP § 2025.450(a) provides, “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.” CCP § 2025.450 requires the Court to compel the deposition unless it finds a valid objection was served under §2025.410. There is no evidence that Plaintiff served any valid objections to the deposition notice, nor did Plaintiff oppose the motion. Therefore, Defendant’s unopposed motion to compel is granted. (CCP § 2025.450(a).) CCP § 2025.450(g)(1) requires the court to impose sanctions unless it finds the deponent acted with substantial justification or there are circumstances that render imposition of sanctions unjust. A court has discretion to award sanctions that are “suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks” but they should not be punitive in nature or levied for the purposes of punishing an offending party. (Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1545.) Defendant requests $1,265.25 in connection with the instant motion for one hour to draft the motion, anticipated time of 1 hour to review the opposition and draft a reply, and one hour to attend the hearing at a rate of $235.00 per hour. Additionally, Defendant seeks $500.25 for the court reporter’s fee and $60.00 for the motion filing fee. (Kaufman Decl. ¶ 18.) Defendant’s counsel declares a copy of the invoice for the court reporter’s fee is attached as Exhibit F. However, the Court is unable to locate any Exhibit F to Defendant counsel’s declaration. The Court therefore grants Defendant’s request in part. Defendant is awarded one hour to draft the motion and one hour to attend the hearing at the reasonable rate of $235.00 per hour for a total of $470.00 in attorney fees. Further, Defendant is awarded the motion filing fee of $60.00 as costs.  IV. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered to appear for her deposition at a date, time, and location to be noticed by Defendant. Defendant must give at least ten days’ notice of the deposition (notice extended per Code if by other than personal service). Plaintiff is ordered to pay sanctions to Defendant, by and through counsel of record, in the total amount of $530.00, within twenty (20) days.  Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: January 2, 2025 __________________________ Hon.
