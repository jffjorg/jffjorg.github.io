And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the petitions filed on October 15, 2024, due to several defects. The petitions failed to provide complete information on certain items of the MC-350 form, including the amount offered to each claimant and the basis for the attorney's fee request. Additionally, the petitions contained inconsistent information and failed to provide a net balance calculation for the settlement amount. The Court has ordered the Petitioner to reserve a new hearing date and file a new petition that cures these defects at least nine court days before the continued hearing date.
