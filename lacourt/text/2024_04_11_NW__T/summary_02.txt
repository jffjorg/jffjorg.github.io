And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made tentative rulings on the motions in limine brought by both the plaintiff and defendant. The plaintiff's motions were granted in part and denied in part. The judge ruled that evidence of alternate causes to the plaintiff's injuries must be established more probably true than not true, and that evidence of insurance, Medicare, or Medi-cal reimbursement rates is not relevant to the reasonable costs of medical services. The judge also ruled that there shall be no mention of settlement or opportunities to settle, or of the failure to take responsibility for one's own injuries.

The defendant's motions were granted in part and denied in part. The judge ruled that the lack of prior incidents is irrelevant if the defendant was the direct cause of the negligence. The judge also ruled that evidence of an unpaid bill may be introduced as evidence of liability for the bill. However, the judge denied the defendant's motion to exclude testimony about the plaintiff's wage loss claim, as well as the plaintiff's motion to introduce evidence of the defendant's failure to take responsibility for the plaintiff's injuries.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling aims to ensure that the trial focuses on the relevant evidence and avoids speculation and irrelevant information.
