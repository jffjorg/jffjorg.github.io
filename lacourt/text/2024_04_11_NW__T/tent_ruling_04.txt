 Case Number:  23VECV04338    Hearing Date:   April 11, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV04338 MARGARIAN V OSORIO
Tentative ruling: Four motions to compel depositions of defendants: Deny
without prejudice for improper service.  The motions were served on an
attorney (Hovsepian) NOT OF RECORD in this case.  The defendants have not
been served at their addresses of record.  There is no Substitution of
Record in the court file.
Furthermore, the court finds that the fees requested are so unreasonable as
to make credibility of the claim for fees in issue.  There is also no breakdown of the amount of
time spent and for what.
Finally, the well-settled rule is that a lawyer who is appearing on his or
her own behalf and is the prevailing party in a lawsuit may not be awarded
attorney fees. Trope v. Katz (1995) 11 Cal.4th 274, 280 (applying
Civil Code § 1717); Musaelian v. Adams (2009) 45 Cal.4th
512, 517 (applying CCP § 128.7). Similarly, “when a law firm is a prevailing
party in a case and is represented by one of its partners, members, or
associates, it cannot recover attorney fees even though the litigation is based
on a contract with a prevailing party clause.” Carpenter &
Zuckerman, LLP v. Cohen, 195 Cal.App.4th 373, 375 (2011).
