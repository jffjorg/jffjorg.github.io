And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on four motions to compel depositions of defendants. The motions were served on an attorney not of record in this case, and the defendants have not been served at their addresses of record. The court finds that the fees requested are unreasonable and that there is no breakdown of the time spent. The Judge also notes that a lawyer who appears on their own behalf and is the prevailing party in a lawsuit cannot be awarded attorney fees, citing several California court cases.
