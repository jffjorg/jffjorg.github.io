  Case Number:  23PSCV00268    Hearing Date:   October 6, 2023    Dept:  K Plaintiff Anthony Tafesh’s Application
for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
Background   
Plaintiff Anthony
Tafesh (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
On
May 7, 2020, Fred Barrera (“Defendant”) executed a “Notice Secured by Deed of
Trust” (“Note”) on behalf of REDC Acquisitions LLC, memorializing therein that
Plaintiff had loaned REDC $30,000.00 and that REDC promised to pay Plaintiff a
balloon payment of $38,500.00. The Note was secured by a “Short Form Deed of
Trust and Assignment of Rents” on the property located at 5115 Cavana Rd., El
Sereno, CA 90032 (“Property”). The Property securing the Note has been
foreclosed upon. 
On January 30, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against Defendant and
Does 1-50 for:
1.                 
Breach
of Contract
2.                 
Money
Had and Received
3.                 
Fraud
On March 13, 2023,
Defendant’s default was entered. On April 6, 2023, Plaintiff dismissed the
second and third causes of action, without prejudice.
An Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment is set for
October 6, 2023.
Discussion
Plaintiffs’ Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.                 
Plaintiff seeks $516.35 in costs. Plaintiff, however,
did not request costs in his complaint. In actions for money damages a default
judgment is limited to the amount demanded in the complaint. (See Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822,
824.) The amount demanded in the complaint is determined both from the prayer
and from the damage allegations in the complaint.
2.                 
Plaintiff appears to sue Defendant on an alter ego
theory of liability, inasmuch as 
Defendant is not a party to the
contract (“Barrera entered into the note on behalf of Redc Acquisitions”
[Plaintiff Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. A]) and did not sign a guaranty re: same; however,
Plaintiff has failed to provide the court with any evidence of alter ego.
3.                 
Plaintiff has provided the court with an unexecuted
copy of the Note. 
4.                 
Plaintiff has not provided the court with the original
Note or explained why the court should accept a copy of same in lieu thereof.
Per California Rules of Court Rule 3.1806, “[i]n all cases in which judgment is
rendered upon a written obligation to pay money, the clerk must, at the time of
entry of judgment, unless otherwise ordered, note over the clerk’s official
signature and across the face of the writing the fact of rendition of judgment
with the date of the judgment and the title of the court and the case.”
