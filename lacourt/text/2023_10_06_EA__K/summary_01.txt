And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's Application for Default Judgment without prejudice. The Plaintiff had sought to obtain default judgment against the Defendant, Fred Barrera, but the Judge has identified several defects in the Plaintiff's application. Specifically, the Plaintiff has not requested costs in his complaint, and the amount demanded in the complaint is limited to the amount alleged in the complaint. Additionally, the Plaintiff has failed to provide evidence of alter ego theory of liability, and has not provided the original Note or explained why a copy of the Note should be accepted. The Judge has noted these defects and denied the application for default judgment, setting an Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment for October 6, 2023.
