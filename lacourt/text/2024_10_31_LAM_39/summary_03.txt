And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by the defendants, Tishbees LLC and Eliot Tishbi, to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Zachary Selvin. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants obtained an unlawful detainer judgment against his business, The Living Earth Wellness Center, and then ignored a temporary restraining order and changed the locks on the premises. The judge is ruling on the demurrer and is sustaining the demurrer to the second, third, and fourth causes of action with leave to amend. The second cause of action, alleging negligence, is sustained because the plaintiff fails to allege a cause of action for negligence. The third and fourth causes of action, alleging violations of Business and Professions Code sections 17200 and 17204, are sustained because the plaintiff fails to specify the particular acts by the defendants that support these causes of action. The plaintiff is ordered to file an amended complaint within 10 days of notice of this order.
