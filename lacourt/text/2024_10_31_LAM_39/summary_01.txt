And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Aggreko LLC, is seeking summary adjudication on the first cause of action for breach of contract against the defendant, the Little Cottage Caregivers LLC. The defendant has failed to pay $63,740.40, which is the amount outstanding on the lease agreement. The plaintiff argues that there are no triable issues of material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. However, the defendant disputes the amount owed and presents a declaration from Shlomo Meiri, who owns a 50% stake in the defendant, which raises triable issues of material fact. The court finds that the amount of damages owed by the defendant is a triable issue of material fact and therefore denies the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication.
