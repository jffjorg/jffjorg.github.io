[1]The County asserts
that “[a]s to the County, Plaintiff asserts the Third, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth
through Tenth Causes of Action only.” (Demurrer at p. 12:1-2.) The County cites
to Plaintiff’s opposition to the County’s motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s Third
Amended Complaint filed in the Federal Action. (County’s RJN, ¶ 3, Ex. C.) This
opposition states, inter alia, that “Causes of Action: 3, 5, 6-10 Belong
to both the City and County of Los Angeles,” and that “Causes of Action: 3, 5,
23-25. Belong to the County of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County Coroner.”
(County’s RJN, ¶ 3, Ex. C, p. 93.) In addition, in her opposition to the County’s
demurrer, Love states that “Causes of Action: 3, 5, 6-10 Belong to both the
City and County of Los Angeles. Causes of Action: 3, 5, 23-25. Belong to the
County of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County Coroner.” (Opp’n at p. 7.) 


[2]The Court notes that Love’s
opposition does not have page numbers. 


[3]As set forth
above, the ninth cause of action of
the TAC is untitled, but alleges that “Plaintiff, as DECEDENT’S successor in
interest, seek [sic] all damages accruing to DECEDENT in a survival action,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 377.34.”
(TAC, ¶ 425.)


[4]The City generally
contends that “Plaintiff’s claims arise from an alleged failure to conduct a
homicide investigation, and as such, they…should be dismissed…” (Demurrer at p.
7:16-18.) However, the City does not provide any argument as to how the fifteenth cause of action
“arise[s] from an alleged failure to conduct a homicide investigation,” to the
extent that is what the City contends.
