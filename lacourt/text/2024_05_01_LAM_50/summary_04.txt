The judge continues the hearing on the defendants' demurrer and motion to strike to a later date. The defendants are ordered to meet and confer with the plaintiff within 10 days to try to resolve the issues. If the parties are unable to resolve the issues or if the defendants are unable to meet and confer in good faith, they must file a declaration setting forth their efforts to meet and confer within 15 days. The defendants are also ordered to give notice of this order.
