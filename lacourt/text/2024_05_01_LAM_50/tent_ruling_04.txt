Background
Plaintiff Denise Wheeler (“Plaintiff”) filed this action on September
21, 2023 against Defendant Center Street Lending Corporation. 
Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on
January 8, 2024 against Defendants Center Street Lending Corporation and Center
Street Lending Fund IV SPE, LLC (jointly, “Defendants”). The FAC alleges causes
of action for (1) violation of Civil Code section
2923.55 and (2) violation of Business and
Professions Code section 17200, et seq. 
Defendants now demur to both of the causes of action of the FAC.
Defendants also move to strike portions of the FAC. Plaintiff filed an
opposition to the demurrer and motion to strike.[1]  
Discussion 
As an initial matter, it
does not appear that Defendants filed any declaration(s) in support of the
demurrer or motion to strike demonstrating that they met and conferred with Plaintiff
in advance of filing the demurrer and motion to strike. 
 Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone,
or by video conference with the party who filed the pleading that is
subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be
reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Emphasis
added.) In addition, “[b]efore filing a motion to
strike pursuant to this chapter, the moving party shall meet and confer in
person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed the
pleading that is subject to the motion to strike for the purpose of determining
if an agreement can be reached that resolves the objections to be raised in the
motion to strike.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd. (a), emphasis
added.) Such meeting and conferring
must be done in good faith with an effort to try to resolve the issues subject
to the demurrer and motion to strike. 
In light of the foregoing,
the hearing on Defendants’
demurrer and motion to strike is continued to _______________, 2024 at 2
p.m. in Dept. 50. 
Defendants
are¿ordered to meet¿and confer¿with Plaintiff within 10 days of the date of
this order.¿If the parties are unable to resolve the pleading issues¿or if the
parties are otherwise unable to meet and confer in good faith, Defendants are to¿thereafter¿file
and serve¿a declaration setting forth the efforts to meet and confer in
compliance with¿Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41,
subdivision (a)(3) and Code
of Civil Procedure section 435.5, subdivision (a)(3) within 15 days of this order.¿
Defendants are ordered to give notice of this order.
