Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The case involves claims of elder abuse and wrongful death against Brighton Convalescent, LLC dba Brighton Care Center and Riverside Equities, LLC dba Mission Care Center. The plaintiff, Conail Kwok, argues that the dismissal was caused by the mistake and neglect of their attorney, Eric Young. However, the Judge finds that the plaintiff has repeatedly failed to prosecute the case, despite numerous warnings from the Court. The Judge also finds that the plaintiff has failed to add and serve the nominal defendants, despite having ample opportunity to do so. Therefore, the Judge denies the motion to set aside the dismissal. The Judge notes that the statute providing for relief from a judgment or dismissal is remedial and should be liberally applied, but the moving party has the burden of showing good cause. In this case, the plaintiff has failed to show good cause for the dismissal, and the motion is denied.
