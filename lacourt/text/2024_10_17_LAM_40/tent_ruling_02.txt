Pursuant to Evidence Code section
452, subdivision (d), the Court may take judicial notice of “[r]ecords of (1)
any court of this state or (2) any court of record of the United States or of
any state of the United States”. 
The court however may not take
judicial notice of the truth of the contents of the documents. (Herrera v.
Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1375.)
Documents are only judicially noticeable to show their existence and what
orders were made such that the truth of the facts and findings within the
documents are not judicially noticeable. (Lockley v. Law Office of Cantrell,
Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 885.)  
The request for judicial notice is
GRANTED, as to Exhibits 2 through 21 [Exhibit 1 is a “chart of litigations” not
sought to be admitted and not considered by the Court]. 
B. Legal Standard
¿“The vexatious litigant statutes
(§§ 391–391.7) are designed to curb misuse of the court system by those
persistent and obsessive litigants who, repeatedly litigating the same issues
through groundless actions, waste the time and resources of the court system
and other litigants.” (Shalant v. Girardi (2011) 51 Cal.4th 1164,
1169.) 
A vexatious litigant is a person
who does any of the following:¿  
(1) In the immediately preceding
seven-year period has commenced, prosecuted, or maintained in propria persona
at least five litigations other than in a small claims court that have been (i)
finally determined adversely to the person or (ii) unjustifiably permitted to
remain pending at least two years without having been brought to trial or
hearing.
(2) After a litigation has been
finally determined against the person, repeatedly relitigates or attempts to
relitigate, in propria persona, either (i) the validity of the determination
against the same defendant or defendants as to whom the litigation was finally
determined or (ii) the cause of action, claim, controversy, or any of the
issues of fact or law, determined or concluded by the final determination
against the same defendant or defendants as to whom the litigation was finally
determined.  
(3) In any litigation while acting
in propria persona, repeatedly files unmeritorious motions, pleadings, or other
papers, conducts unnecessary discovery, or engages in other tactics that are
frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.
(4) Has previously been declared
to be a vexatious litigant by any state or federal court of record in any
action or proceeding based upon the same or substantially similar facts,
transaction, or occurrence. 
(5) After being restrained
pursuant to a restraining order issued after a hearing pursuant to Chapter 1
(commencing with Section 6300) of Part 4 of Division 10 of the Family Code, and
while the restraining order is still in place, they commenced, prosecuted, or
maintained one or more litigations against a person protected by the
restraining order in this or any other court or jurisdiction that are
determined to be meritless and caused the person protected by the order to be
harassed or intimidated. 
(Code Civ. Proc. §
391, subds. (b)-(b)(4).)¿¿ 
“[T]he court may, on its own
motion or the motion of any party, enter a prefiling order which prohibits a
vexatious litigant from filing any new litigation in the courts of this state
in propria persona without first obtaining leave of the presiding justice or
presiding judge of the court where the litigation is proposed to be filed.
Disobedience of the order by a vexatious litigant may be punished as a contempt
of court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 397.1, subd. (a).) 
“The presiding justice or
presiding judge of a court may designate a justice or judge of the same court
to act on his or her behalf in exercising the authority and responsibilities
provided under subdivisions (a) to (c) [of section 397.1], inclusive.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 397.1, subd. (e).) 
Section 391.1 provides that a
motion for order to furnish security a defendant must show “the plaintiff is a
vexatious litigant and that there is not a reasonable probability that he or
she will prevail in the litigation against the moving defendant.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 391.1, subd. (a).) 
Section 391.7, subdivision (a)
provides that “[i]n addition to any other relief provided in this title, the
court may, on its own motion or the motion of any party, enter a prefiling
order which prohibits a vexatious litigant from filing any new litigation in
the courts of this state in propria persona without first obtaining leave of
the presiding¿justice or presiding¿judge of the court where the litigation is
proposed to be filed. Disobedience of the order by a vexatious litigant may be
punished as a contempt of court.”¿¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 397.7, subd. (a).) 
C. Analysis
The City of Los Angeles moves for
(1) an order declaring Plaintiff Renato Obando a vexatious litigant pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure § 391(b), (2) requiring Obando to post statutorily
required security, or dismiss this action with prejudice pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure § 391.1(a), and (3) issuing a prefiling order prohibiting Obando
from filing any new litigation in California state courts in propria persona
without first obtaining leave of the Presiding Judge of the court in which the
litigation is proposed to be filed pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 391.7.
First, the City of Los Angeles contends
that Obando is a vexatious litigant. Obando has filed, pro per, 12 other
litigations in the last 7 years, including lawsuits and petitions for habeas
corpus in the Superior Court, Central District of California, California Court
of Appeal, and Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal, not including the current case,
most of which arise from his 1981 arrest and subsequent conviction, which were
all adversely determined against him. (Mot. p. 3:6-8; RJN Exs. 3-21.) Obando
also filed two cases in 2016 which were terminated in 2017 and 2018. (Mot. p.
3:10-11.) 
Obando has filed multiple cases in
both state and federal court, and subsequent appeals against the same
defendants, including the City of Los Angeles and Frank Bolan. (Mot. pp. 3:16-4:8.)
Both the California Court of Appeals and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
have dismissed the appeals as frivolous and for failure to prosecute. (Mot. pp.
3:19-20, 3:24-28.) Obando has similarly filed numerous Habeas Petitions between
1989 and 2024 related to his criminal conviction which have been adversely
determined against him. (Mot. p. 4:1-8.) Further, the City of Los Angeles
contends that the California Court of Appeal, the United States District Court,
and the Ninth Circuit have all previously recognized Obando’s vexatious nature.
(Mot. p. 5:1-10; RJN Exs. 4-7.)
Second, the City of Los Angeles
argues that there is no probability of success on this matter and thus, pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 391.1 subdivision (a), Obando should be
ordered to post a security. (Code of Civ. Proc. § 391.1 subd. (a).) The City of
Los Angeles asserts that Obando has no reasonable probability of prevailing in
this case because it is based on the same grounds as his previously dismissed
complaints. (Complaint, pp. 6-10, Section I, ¶¶ 1-63.) The City of Los Angeles
contends that the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel bar the
instant Complaint as well as the statute of limitations. (Mot. p. 5:26-27.) 
In opposition, Obando argues that
he should not be declared a vexatious litigant because his claim of excessive
force has never been decided on the merits. 
“When considering a motion to
declare a litigant vexatious, the court must weigh the evidence to decide
whether the litigant is vexatious based on the statutory criteria and whether
the litigant has a reasonable probability of prevailing.” (Goodrich v.
Sierra Vista Regional Medical Center (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1265).
Here, under CCP § 391 subdivision (b)(2), an individual is considered a
vexatious litigant if the litigant, acting in propria persona, attempts to
relitigate either the “the validity of the determination against the same
defendant or defendants as to whom the litigation was finally determined or
(ii) the cause of action, claim, controversy, or any of the issues of fact or
law, determined or concluded by the final determination against the same
defendant or defendants as to whom the litigation was finally determined.” 
Obando has filed twelve separate
actions, all based on the issues related to his arrest and subsequent criminal
conviction. The cases have ended with appeals court affirming the lower courts
dismissals, the Supreme Court has denied review. Obando is attempting to
relitigate the issues that multiple trial courts and Courts of Appeal have
determined as final, as his own complaint acknowledges. (Complaint, pp. 6-10.)

Further, under Code of Civil Procedure
section 391.1, a plaintiff is required to furnish a security if the plaintiff
is a vexatious litigant and there is no “reasonable probability that he or she
will prevail in the litigation against the moving defendant.” Here, the same
issues are being relitigated and there is no probability that the Obando will
succeed. Multiple prior courts have dismissed the matter, with the Court of
Appeal affirming such actions. 
Accordingly, the Motion to Declare
a Vexatious Litigant is GRANTED.    
III. Conclusion
Defendant City of Los Angeles’s
Motion to Declare a Vexatious Litigant and Motion for Order Requiring Security
is GRANTED.   
Renato Obando is hereby ordered
to post a $5,000.000 security, or dismiss this action with prejudice.
Renato Obando is hereby
prohibited from filing any new litigation in a California state courts in
propria persona without first obtaining leave of the Presiding Judge of the
court in which the litigation is proposed to be filed.
