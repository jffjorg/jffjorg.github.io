**Case Information**

* Case Number: 24STCV07197
* Hearing Date: October 17, 2024
* Department: 40 Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles

**Party Information**

* Plaintiff: Renato Obando
* Defendant: City of Los Angeles, Mario Mojarro, Frank Bolan, Robert C. Vanderet

**Summary of the Case**

* Plaintiff Obando sues the City of Los Angeles, Detective Mojarro, Detective Bolan, and Judge Vanderet alleging a cause of action under the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act, arising from alleged excessive force by Detective Bolan in 1981.
* Obando is currently serving a life sentence without parole for a murder conviction.

**Ruling**

* The City of Los Angeles moves for an order declaring Obando a vexatious litigant, requiring him to post security, or dismissing the action with prejudice.
* The Court finds that Obando has filed 12 other litigations in the last 7 years, including lawsuits and petitions for habeas corpus, most of which arise from his 1981 arrest and subsequent conviction, which were all adversely determined against him.
* The Court concludes that Obando is a vexatious litigant and that there is no probability of success in this matter.
* The Court orders Obando to post a $5,000,000 security, or dismiss the action with prejudice.
* Obando is prohibited from filing any new litigation in California state courts in propria persona without first obtaining leave of the Presiding Judge of the court in which the litigation is proposed to be filed.

**Key Points**

* Obando has filed multiple cases in both state and federal court, and subsequent appeals against the same defendants, including the City of Los Angeles and Frank Bolan.
* Both the California Court of Appeals and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals have dismissed the appeals as frivolous and for failure to prosecute.
* Obando has filed numerous Habeas Petitions between 1989 and 2024 related to his criminal conviction which have been adversely determined against him.
* The Court finds that Obando is attempting to relitigate issues that multiple trial courts and Courts of Appeal have determined as final.

**Significant Statements**

* "The vexatious litigant statutes are designed to curb misuse of the court system by those persistent and obsessive litigants who, repeatedly litigating the same issues through groundless actions, waste the time and resources of the court system and other litigants."
* "When considering a motion to declare a litigant vexatious, the court must weigh the evidence to decide whether the litigant is vexatious based on the statutory criteria and whether the litigant has a reasonable probability of prevailing."
