  - "The Court’s function is not to determine issues of fact, ‘factual issues must be resolved by trial’"
```

Summary:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion for summary adjudication of the plaintiff's ninth cause of action, which alleges intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) and breach of oral contract. The judge found that there are triable issues of material fact regarding whether the IIED claim is time-barred by the statute of limitations and whether the defendants are vicariously liable for the IIED claim under a conspiracy theory. The judge also found that there is evidence that Moonves, the former CEO of CBS Corporation, was involved in the alleged conspiracy to harass and threaten the plaintiff, and that the defendants' engagement of Khan, Davidson, and others, as well as their contemporaneous emails and events that followed, could be inferred to establish a conspiratorial relationship.
