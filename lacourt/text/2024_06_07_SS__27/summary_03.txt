```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the motion for relief from default filed by defendant Sean Lawson. The court finds that defendant had actual notice of the action, despite claiming to have no knowledge of the suit. The court considered various factors in reaching this conclusion, including the fact that defendant resides at the address where service was attempted, the process server's description of the individual served matches defendant's characteristics, and the process server possessed a photograph of defendant when effecting personal service. The court also rejects defendant's argument that the motion is untimely, as defendant had actual notice of the action long before filing the motion.
