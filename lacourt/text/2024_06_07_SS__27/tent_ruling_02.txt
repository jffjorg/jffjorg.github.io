Legal Standard
 
1.  Requests for
Production and Interrogatories
 
A defendant may make a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling without leave of court at any time.
Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd.
(a).) A plaintiff may make a demand for production of documents and propound
interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10 days after the service of
the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom the demand is directed,
whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) A plaintiff may make a demand for
production of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at
any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the
party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for
production of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply
with the formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party
may propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the
subject matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).)
 
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).)
 
If a party fails to timely respond
to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the
discovery requests may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to compel further discovery responses, a
motion to compel initial discovery responses does not have any meet and confer
requirements.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿¿A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)
 
2.  Request for Admissions
 
“Any party may obtain discovery .
. . by a written request that any other party to the action admit the
genuineness of specified documents, or the truth of specified matters of fact,
opinion relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for admission
may relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.”¿ CCP § 2033.010.¿ “Within 30 days after service of
requests for admission, the party to whom the requests are directed shall serve
the original of the response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the
response on all other parties who have appeared ....”¿ CCP § 2033.250(a).
 
If a party to
whom request for admissions are served fails to provide a timely response, the
party to whom the request was directed waives any objections, including based
on privilege or the work product doctrine. CCP § 2033.280(a). The requesting
party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted, as well as for
monetary sanctions. CCP § 2033.280(b). The court shall issue this order unless
the party to whom the request was made serves a response in substantial
compliance prior to the hearing on the motion. CCP § 2033.280(c). Unlike a
motion to compel further discovery responses, a motion to deem RFA admitted
does not have any meet and confer requirements.
 
Discussion
On March 7, 2024,
Defendant ALWAYS PRIVATE SECURITY SERVICES, INC. served its first set of Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Requests for Production of Documents,
and Requests for Admissions on Plaintiff TZU-FEI CHU, who is appearing pro per.
The deadline for Plaintiff's responses was April 8, 2024. After receiving no
discovery responses by April 17, 2024, Defendant attempted to meet and confer
with Plaintiff, setting a new response deadline of April 26, 2024. As of April
29, 2024, the date on which the current motions were filed, Plaintiff has not
provided any written responses to Defendant's discovery requests nor requested
an extension. Defendant now moves the court to compel initial responses and
deem the contents of its RFA, set one, admitted.
It is undisputed that
Plaintiff failed to serve the discovery responses at issue prior to the
statutory deadline. No oppositions were filed, nor were there any filings
indicating that the responses were served prior to the hearing. Consequently,
the present motions are GRANTED. The contents of Defendant’s Requests for
Admissions, Set One, are deemed admitted. Plaintiff is ORDERED to provide
complete and verified discovery responses without objections within 20 days of
today.
The court grants the
present motions and sanctions are mandatory. The court does not find that
Plaintiff acted with substantial justification. Defendant requested sanctions
in the amount of $320.00 per motion. The Court finds this amount reasonable.
Accordingly, the Court ORDERS Plaintiff to pay sanctions totaling $1280 to
Defendant within 20 days of today’s date.
