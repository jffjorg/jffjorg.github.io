And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that summary adjudication is denied on the issues of duty, notice, and causation. The plaintiff, Nakisa Nowzar, slipped and fell on a water puddle in the parking garage, allegedly due to the defendant's negligence. The defendant, Personal Touch Cleaning, argues that it did not owe a duty of care to the plaintiff, had no notice of the condition that caused the injury, and did not cause or create the condition that caused the injury. The court finds that the defendant failed to meet its initial burden of proof on these issues, and therefore, the issues are left for the jury to decide.
