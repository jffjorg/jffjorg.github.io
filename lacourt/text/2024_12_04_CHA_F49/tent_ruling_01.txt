RESPONDING PARTY: None.
NOTICE: OK.
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order from this Court to compel Plaintiff ASG Cannabis LLC LA Fav Farms to
respond to Defendant City of Los Angeles’s Special Interrogatories, Set One,
and to impose monetary sanctions against Plaintiff ASG Cannabis LLC LA Fav
Farms and its counsel in the amount of $500.00.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is GRANTED. The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from an allegedly unreasonable search by
Defendants City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles Police Department on March 11, 2022,
at Plaintiff Sokrat Grigorian’s indoor marijuana cultivation site, purportedly
licensed as ASG Cannabis LLC Fav Farms, located at 13900 La Rue Street, San
Fernando, CA 91340.
 
On February 17, 2023, Plaintiffs Sokrat Grigorian
(“Grigorian”) and ASG Cannabis LLC La Fav Farms (“ASG Cannabis”) (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint against Defendants City of Los Angeles (“City of LA”) and Los Angeles Police Department
(“LAPD”) (collectively, “Defendants”) and Does 1 through 20, alleging the
following causes of action: (1) Unreasonable Search (42 U.S.C. §
1983), (2) Conversion, (3) Trespass to Chattels, (4) Trespass, and (5)
Negligence. Subsequently, on June 28, 2023, Defendants filed their
Answer to the Complaint.
 
On September
25, 2024, Defendant City of LA filed the instant Motion to Compel Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One (the “Motion”). Subsequently, City of LA filed a
Notice of Non-Opposition on November 25, 2024.
 
No Opposition or Reply papers
have been received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“If a party to
whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary
sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The statute contains no
time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have been served. All that
needs to be shown in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was
properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired,
and that no response of any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)
 
Additionally,
“[i]f a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
response ... [t]he party to whom the
interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce
writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the
interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product...” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Motion to Compel
Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One
 
Defendant City of LA’s
counsel, Christina P. Schmidt (“Schmidt”), attests that on June 12, 2024, Special
Interrogatories, Set One, were served upon Plaintiff ASG Cannabis by mail. (Schmidt
Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. “A.”) This service established that responses were due on July
17, 2024, including a five-calendar-day extension applicable to service by mail
under Code of Civil Procedure section 1013, subdivision (a). On July 9, 2024,
ASG Cannabis’s counsel requested an extension to respond until July 30, 2024. (Id.
¶ 3.) On August 5, 2024, City of LA sent an email correspondence requesting the
outstanding discovery as no responses were received. (Id. ¶ 4.)  However, as of the date of the filing of the
Motion, ASG Cannabis had not served any responses. (Id. ¶ 7.) 
 
Based on the above records,
the Court determines that Plaintiff ASG Cannabis failed to serve a timely
response, thereby waiving any objection to the interrogatories, including those
based on privilege or the protection for work product, pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (a).
 
Nevertheless,
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (a), “[t]he court,
on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that
both of the following conditions are satisfied: ¶ (1) The party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections
2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. ¶ (2) The party’s failure to serve
a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect.”
 
Here,
Plaintiff ASG Cannabis did not file an Opposition to
the Motion. Nor did it move separately for relief from the waiver.
Additionally, there is no record indicating that any responses were
subsequently served by Plaintiff ASG Cannabis prior to the hearing.
Consequently, the Court finds that relief under Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.290, subdivision (a) is unavailable in this circumstance.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the unopposed
Motion.
 
B.    
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (c), “[t]he Court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust....” 
 
Additionally,
California Rules of Court rule 3.1348(A) further provides, “The Court may award
sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to
compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Underlines added.)
 
The Court finds the mandatory sanction
applies in this case. Utilizing the lodestar approach, the Court determines the
total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work
performed in connection with the Motion to be $500.00, calculated based on a
reasonable hourly rate of $250.00 for two hours of work reasonably spent.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendant City of LA’s request
for monetary sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant City of Los Angeles’s unopposed Motion to Compel
Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff
ASG Cannabis LLC La Fav Farms is ordered to serve verified responses, without
objection, to the Special Interrogatories, Set One, within 20 days. 
 
Defendant City of Los Angeles’s
Request
for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED. 
 
Plaintiff
ASG Cannabis LLC La Fav Farms and its attorney of record are ordered to jointly
and severally pay $500.00 to Defendant City of
Los Angeles’s counsel within 20 days
