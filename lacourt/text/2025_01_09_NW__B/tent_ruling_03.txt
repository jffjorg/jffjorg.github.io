BACKGROUND
 
On September
14, 2021, Plaintiff Mynor Villeda (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants University of Southern California (“USC”) and Does 1 to 10
(collectively “Defendants”), alleging two causes of action: (1) premises
liability; and (2) general negligence. The complaint alleges that, on or about
June 8, 2020, Plaintiff, who was an employee at Defendants’ premises, stepped
into a hole approximately five to six inches deep, thereby incurring injuries
and damages as a result of Defendants’ negligence. (Complaint ¶ 5.)
 
On
December 30, 2021, USC filed a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Aramark
Management Services Limited Partnership (“Aramark”) and Roes 1 to 10 alleging
six causes of action: (1) express indemnity; (2) declaratory relief as to duty
to defend and indemnify; (3) equitable indemnity; (4) apportionment; (5)
contribution; and (6) declaratory relief as to equitable apportionment
contribution and indemnification.
 
On
February 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement of the entire case.
 
On August
29, 2024, the Court dismissed the action without prejudice pursuant to Cal.  Rules of Court Rule 3.1385(c)(2) and Cal. Code
of Civ. Proc. § 664.6
 
On September 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant motion for order to set aside and vacate dismissal.


On December 26, 2024, USC filed their
opposition.
 
On January 2, 2025, Plaintiff filed their
reply.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
“Section 473(b) provides for both
discretionary and mandatory relief [from dismissal]. [Citation.]” (Pagnini
v. Union Bank, N.A. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 298, 302.) An application for
relief under this section must be made no more than six months after entry of
the judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding from which relief is sought
and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect of the moving party or its attorney. (Cal. Code of Civ.
Proc. § 473(b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th
130, 143.) Additionally, an application for relief under this section “shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
herein, otherwise the application shall not be granted.” (CCP § 473(b).) Relief
under this section is mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault;
otherwise, it is discretionary. (Ibid.) When dismissal is the attorney’s
fault, the six-month period starts to run from the date of the entry of dismissal.
(CCP § 473(b); Sugasawara v. Newland (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 294, 295.)
DISCUSSION
As a
preliminary matter, the Court notes that Plaintiff failed to include a proposed
pleading. An application for relief under CCP § 473(b) must be accompanied by a
copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein; otherwise,
the application shall not be granted. (CCP § 473(b).) Therefore, the instant
motion must be denied.
 
Nonetheless,
for both parties’ benefit, the Court now considers the merits of Plaintiff’s
motion.
 
Plaintiff
argues that the Court should set aside dismissal because Plaintiff did not
sign, nor agree to sign, the settlement agreement. (Motion p. 3:6-12.)
Plaintiff alleges there was a misunderstanding between himself and prior
counsel. (Ibid.) Therefore, Plaintiff argues, dismissal must be set
aside because it occurred from his prior counsel’s mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect. (CCP § 473(b).) 
 
Plaintiff
provides affidavits from both current and prior counsel declaring that
Plaintiff’s prior counsel, John Jahrmarkt, Esq. (“Jahrmarkt”), mistakenly filed
a notice of settlement. (Asryan Decl. ¶ 4; Exh. 1 [Jahrmarkt Decl.] at ¶¶ 3-5].)
Jahrmarkt declares that, due to language barriers, he mistakenly believed
Plaintiff agreed to the $100,000 settlement amount which Defendants offered
during a June 19, 2023, mediation conference. (Jahrmarkt Decl. ¶¶ 4 and 5.)
Jahrmarkt confirms that Plaintiff never signed nor agreed to the settlement. (Ibid.
at ¶ 11.) Therefore, Plaintiff makes a showing of attorney fault, mistake,
inadvertence, surprise or neglect warranting relief pursuant to CCP § 473(b).
 
In opposition,
USC argues that Plaintiff must have filed a motion for reconsideration within
10 days of ruling on their ex parte application to set aside settlement, which
was denied on August 27, 2024. (Opposition p. 2:23-28 and 3:1-7.) However, this
application was denied on the grounds that there was “no showing of great or
irreparable harm necessitating emergency ex-parte relief.” (See August
27, 2024, Minute Order.) The Court did not address the substance of Plaintiff’s
motion as USC erroneously represents.
 
On substantive
grounds, Plaintiff meets all requirements for relief pursuant to CCP § 473(b). Nonetheless,
the motion is still denied for Plaintiff’s failure to include the proposed
pleading as required by § 473(b).
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff Mynor Villeda’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal is DENIED for
failure to meet the statutory requirements of CCP § 473(b).
