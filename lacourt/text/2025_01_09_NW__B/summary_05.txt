Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Moskowitz issued a tentative ruling denying Hertz's motion for summary judgment. Hertz had moved for summary judgment on the grounds that Plaintiff's claim was barred by the Graves Amendment and that Plaintiff could not establish the elements of breach and causation due to lack of evidence. However, the Court found that Hertz failed to meet its initial burden on the motion. Specifically, Hertz did not provide admissible evidence that it was engaged in the trade or business of renting or leasing motor vehicles, as required by the Graves Amendment. Additionally, Hertz relied on inadmissible evidence and failed to provide evidence that Plaintiff could not reasonably obtain evidence to support their claim. Therefore, the Court denied Hertz's motion for summary judgment and ordered Hertz to give notice. The matter is set for a hearing on January 9, 2025.
