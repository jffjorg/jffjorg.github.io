TIME:  8:30 A.M.
 
COMPLAINT
  FILED: FEBRUARY 14, 2022
TRIAL
  DATE: AUGUST 11, 2025



 
I.      
BACKGROUND  
On February 14, 2022,
Plaintiff Glendis Beker (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against
Defendants the Hertz Corporation (“Hertz”), Romaine Kirlew (“Kirlew”), and
Does 1 through 50 (collectively “Defendants”) alleging three causes of action:
(1) negligence; (2) negligence per se; and (3) statutory liability. The
complaint arises from an April 29, 2021, motor vehicle accident in which
Plaintiff allegedly suffered injuries when Defendants, due to negligent
operation and ownership of a motor vehicle, collided with Plaintiff’s motor
vehicle. (Complaint ¶¶ 13-19.)
On March 27, 2024, Hertz filed the
instant motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s complaint.
On June 6, 2024, the matter
was reassigned to the Honorable Judge Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys
Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024. 
On November 12, 2024,
Plaintiff filed their opposition. 
On November 15, 2024, Hertz filed
their reply. 
 
II.      
MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
Hertz moves for summary judgment or,
in the alternative, summary adjudication on Plaintiff’s complaint on the grounds
that (1) Plaintiff’s claim for negligence against Hertz is barred by the Graves
Amendment; and (2) even if the Graves Amendment did not bar Plaintiff’s claim,
Plaintiff will not be able to establish the elements of breach and causation
due to lack of evidence. (Motion p. 2:14-23.)
 
III.      
LEGAL
STANDARDS 
Burden on Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication 
In reviewing a motion for
summary judgment, the Court must apply a three-step analysis: (1) identify the
issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has met
his or her initial burden; and (3) determine whether the opposition has
demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue. (Hinesley
v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.) “[T]he
initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that
there are no triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf v. D.B. Log Homes,
Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant moving for summary
judgment or summary adjudication has met his or her burden of showing that a
cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more elements
of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete
defense to the cause of action.” (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 437c(p)(2).) 
A moving defendant may
satisfy the initial burden to show that one or more elements cannot be
established by “presenting evidence that conclusively negates an element of the
plaintiff's cause of action or by relying on the plaintiff's factually devoid
discovery responses to show that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot
reasonably obtain, evidence to establish that element.” (Schmidt v.
Citibank, N.A. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 1109, 1119; Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 856 [it is insufficient for the
defendant to merely point out the absence of evidence.]; Gaggero v. Yura
(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884, 891.) “The defendant must present evidence,
typically in the form of factually devoid discovery responses, showing that
plaintiff does not have and cannot reasonably obtain evidence to support his or
her claim.” (Ibid.) 
Unless and until a defendant
meets that burden, the plaintiff has no burden to present controverting
evidence. (Consumer Cause, Inc. v. SmileCare (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 454,
468 [“There is no obligation on the opposing party . . . to establish anything
by affidavit unless and until the moving party has by affidavit stated facts
establishing every element . . . necessary to sustain a judgment in his
favor.”].) If a defendant fails to meet that burden, summary judgment must be
denied, even if the plaintiff fails to file an opposition and fails to proffer
any evidence. 
On the other hand, if the
defendant “has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to
show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause
of action or a defense thereto.” (CCP § 437c(p)(2).) The plaintiff may not
merely rely on allegations or denials in its pleadings to show that a triable
issue of material fact exists, but instead “shall set forth the specific facts
showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the cause of
action.” (Ibid.) “If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment should
be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467.) 
 
IV.      
DISCUSSION 
Evidentiary Objections
Plaintiff’s November 12, 2024, evidentiary objections are sustained
as to Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. The Hall declaration is not
signed and was not made under penalty of perjury. Therefore, it is inadmissible
pursuant to CCP §§ 98 and 437c. Plaintiff’s objections are also sustained as to
Nos. 12 and 14 as the traffic collision report and rental agreement lack
foundation and authentication. (Cal. Evid. Code §§ 403, 1400, and 1271.)
Plaintiff’s evidentiary objections are overruled as to Nos. 13 and 15.
 
Defendant’s Burden 
Hertz fails to meet their initial
burden. 
Hertz moves for summary judgment
or, in the alternative, summary adjudication on Plaintiff’s complaint on the
grounds that (1) Plaintiff’s claim for negligence against Hertz is barred by
the Graves Amendment; and (2) even if the Graves Amendment did not bar
Plaintiff’s claim, Plaintiff will not be able to establish the elements of
breach and causation due to lack of evidence. (Motion p. 2:14-23.)
 
The
Graves Amendment
Hertz argues that Plaintiff’s claims must
fail pursuant to 49 USC § 30106. (Motion p. 7:10-13; the “Graves Amendment” or
“Graves”.) The Graves Amendment states in relevant part:
“An owner of a motor vehicle that rents or
leases the vehicle to a person (or an affiliate of the owner) shall not be
liable under the law of any State or political subdivision thereof, by reason
of being the owner of the vehicle (or an affiliate of the owner), for harm to
persons or property that results or arises out of the use, operation, or
possession of the vehicle during the period of the rental or lease, if--
 
(1) the owner (or an affiliate of the owner)
is engaged in the trade or business of renting or leasing motor vehicles; ¿and
(2) there is no negligence or criminal
wrongdoing on the part of the owner (or an affiliate of the owner).” (49 USC §
30106(a) – 49 USC § 30106(a)(2).)”
 
Graves generally preempts all state statutory
and common law to the extent those laws hold owners in the business of renting
or leasing motor vehicles vicariously liable for the negligence of drivers,
except when there is negligence or criminal wrongdoing on the part of the
owner. (29 A.L.R. Fed. 2d 223.) However, not all state statutes are preempted.
First, Hertz must provide evidence that they
are engaged in the trade or business of renting or leasing motor vehicles. (49
USC § 30106(a)(1).) Hertz claims that, at the time of the subject incident,
they were in the business of renting or leasing motor vehicles. (Hertz Separate
Statement of Facts “H-SSF” No. 7.) Plaintiff disputes this fact. (See Plaintiff
Response to Hertz Separate Statement of Facts “PR-HSSF” No 7.) As evidence, Hertz
solely relies on the declaration of Kirstie F. Hall (“Hall”). As aforementioned,
the Hall declaration is unsigned and unsworn. Therefore, the declaration is
inadmissible for the purposes of this summary judgment. Consequently, Hertz
fails to provide admissible evidence that Plaintiff’s claims are barred by the
Graves Amendment.
 
Breach and Causation
Next, Hertz argues that, even if the Graves
Amendment does not bar Plaintiff’s claims, Plaintiff cannot provide evidence
proving elements of negligence, namely, breach and causation. (Motion p.
11:3-8.)
To succeed on a claim for negligence,
Plaintiff must show that: (1) defendant owed a legal duty to plaintiff to use
due care; (2) defendant breached that duty; (3) defendant’s breach was the
actual or proximate cause of plaintiff’s harm; and (4) plaintiff suffered
damages as a result. (County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2006)
137 Cal.App.4th 292, 318; Ladd v. County of San Mateo (1996) 12 Cal.4th
913, 917.) Hertz argues that Plaintiff cannot establish a breach of duty or
causation because Hertz, a business entity, was not operating the vehicle at
the time of the underlying incident. (H-SSF No. 5.) Hertz further claims that
there is no evidence of negligent maintenance of the rental car or negligent
entrustment to Kirlew. (H-SSF Nos. 9 – 12.) 
Plaintiff disputes these claims. (PR-HSSF
Nos. 9-12.) As evidence, Hertz relies on the inadmissible Hall declaration and
unauthenticated traffic collision report. (See Hertz Exhibit List Exh. C
[traffic collision report].) Hertz also relies on its responses to Plaintiff’s
Form Interrogatories, Set One. (See Hertz Exhibit List Exh. H [Hertz’s
responses to form interrogatories].) Finally, Hertz also relies on Plaintiff
responses to Hertz’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 20.9-20.10, where
Plaintiff states that they are unaware of any malfunctions or defects in a
vehicle which contributed to the underlying incident. (Hertz Exhibit List Exh.
E [Plaintiff’s response Nos. 20.9-20.10].)
However, to succeed on a motion for summary
judgment, it is insufficient for movant to merely point out the absence of
evidence. (Aguilar,
supra,
25 Cal.4th at 856.) Instead, the movant must “present evidence, typically
in the form of factually devoid discovery responses, showing that plaintiff
does not have and cannot reasonably obtain evidence to support his or her
claim.” (Gaggero, supra, 108 Cal.App.4th at 891.) Here, Hertz fails to
provide evidence that Plaintiff cannot reasonably obtain evidence as to Hertz’s
negligent maintenance, entrustment, or other wrongdoing in relation to the
underlying incident. In fact, discovery in the instant action remains ongoing. (Plaintiff’s
Separate Statement of Facts “P-SSF” No. 20; Exh. N [signed stipulation to
continue trial and all related dates]; Movsesian Decl. ¶¶ 23 and 24.)
Therefore, it’s very possible that Plaintiff could obtain evidence supporting
their negligence claim against Hertz.
Since
Hertz failed to meet their burden on summary judgment, Plaintiff has no burden
to present controverting evidence. (Consumer Cause, Inc., supra, (2001)
91 Cal.App.4th at 468 [“There is no obligation on the opposing party . . . to
establish anything by affidavit unless and until the moving party has by
affidavit stated facts establishing every element . . . necessary to sustain a
judgment in his favor.”].)
Accordingly,
Hertz’s motion for summary judgment is denied.
 
V.      
CONCLUSION
             Hertz fails to meet their initial burden on a
motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, Hertz’s motion for summary judgment
is DENIED. 
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
