COMPLAINT
  FILED: DECEMBER 30, 2021
TRIAL
  DATE: MARCH 17, 2025



 
I.      
BACKGROUND  
On
December 30, 2021, Plaintiff Brittany Moore (“Moore”) filed a complaint against
Defendants Tomas Cruz (“Cruz”), Alvaro Alacon (“Alacon”), Uber Technologies,
Inc. (“Uber”), Rasier LLC (“Rasier”), Rasier-CA LLC (“Rasier-CA”), and Does 1
through 50 alleging one cause of action for motor vehicle negligence.
On
January 11, 2022, Cruz filed a complaint against Defendants Alacon, Uber,
Rasier, Rasier-CA, and Does 1 through 25 alleging one cause of action for
negligence.
On
May 21, 2023, a joint stipulation was filed and granted to consolidate Moore
and Cruz’s complaints in the instant action.
On
November 18, 2024, Rasier filed the instant motions to compel Cruz’s further
responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set Two,
Request for Admissions, Set Two, and Request for Production of Documents, Set
Two (“Discovery Motions”). Rasier also request sanctions.
On
December 3, 2024, Cruz filed their oppositions.
On
December 10, 2024, Rasier filed their replies.
On
December 17, 2024, hearings on the instant discovery motions were continued to
January 9, 2025. Additionally, the Court ordered counsel to meet and confer
regarding outstanding discovery issues and to file a declaration thereof at
least five days prior to the instant hearing. (See December 17, 2024,
Minute Order.)
On
January 2, 2025, counsel filed a joint declaration regarding outstanding
discovery issues. The parties have resolved their issues as to Cruz’s responses
to Rasier’s Special Interrogatories, Set Two, and Request for Production of
Documents, Set Two. (Joint Decl. ¶ 17.) The parties have not resolved their
issues as to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Admissions, Set
Two. (Ibid. at ¶ 18.)
The
Court now considers Rasier’s motions to compel Cruz’s further responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Admissions, Set Two (“Discovery
Motions”).
 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
Interrogatories
Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §
2030.300 provides, in pertinent part, that “[o]n receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following
apply: (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.
(2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate. (3)
An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.” (CCP §
2030.300(a).) 
Unless notice of a motion to
compel further responses is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed
in writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further
response. (CCP § 2030.300(c).) 
 
Request for Admissions
CCP § 2033.290 provides, in
pertinent part, that “[o]n receipt of a response to requests for admissions,
the party requesting admissions may move for an order compelling a further
response if that party deems that either or both of the following apply: (1) An
answer to a particular request is evasive or incomplete. (2) An objection to a
particular request is without merit or too general.” (CCP § 2033.290(a).) 
Unless notice of a motion to
compel further responses is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed
in writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further
response. (CCP § 2033.290(c).)
Under California law, the
objecting party has the burden of justifying its objections when the
propounding party requests that the Court order further responses. (Coy v.
Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221.) Further, under CCP §
2023.010, it is a misuse of discovery to make unmerited objections. (CCP §
2023.010(e).) 
 
III.      
DISCUSSION 
Meet and Confer Requirement
A motion to compel further
responses shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (CCP §§
2030.300(b), 2033.290(b), and 2031.310(b).) Rasier propounded discovery
requests upon Cruz on April 26, 2024. (Dance Decl. ¶ 5.) Cruz failed to provide
responses by the May 29, 2024 deadline. (Ibid. at ¶ 6.) On June 4, 2024,
defense counsel sent Plaintiff’s counsel a meet and confer letter. (Ibid. at
¶ 7; Exh. D [June 4, 2024, correspondence].) Defense counsel granted
Plaintiff’s counsel various extensions to serve discovery responses. (Ibid. at
¶¶ 7 and 8; Exh. D; Exh. E [June 28, 2024, correspondence].) On June 28, 2024,
Plaintiff served their discovery responses. (Ibid. at ¶ 9; Exh. G
[Plaintiff’s responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One].) On July 12, 2024,
defense counsel sent Plaintiff’s counsel a meet and confer letter regarding
alleged deficiencies in Plaintiff’s responses. (Ibid. at ¶ 10; Exh. H
[July 12, 2024, correspondence].) On July 18, 2024, Plaintiff served allegedly
defective amended responses to Rasier’s discovery requests. (Ibid. at ¶
11; Exh. J [Plaintiff’s supplemental responses to Form Interrogatories, Set
One].) Defense counsel attended an informal discovery conference on August 26,
2024, in an attempt to resolve these discovery issues, but were ultimately
unsuccessful. (Ibid. at ¶ 13.) After additional extensions and
conferring, Rasier ultimately filed the instant motions. (See Dance
Decl. ¶¶ 15-17.) Finally, counsel meet and conferred regarding discovery issues
on December 17 and 20, 2024. (Joint Decl. ¶ 3.) Pursuant to CCP § 2016.040,
Rasier presents facts showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” at an
informal resolution. (CCP § 2016.040.) Therefore, Rasier satisfies the meet and
confer requirements of CCP §§ 2030.300(b) and 2033.290(b).
 
Form Interrogatories, Set One
Rasier moves to compel
Plaintiff’s further response to Form Interrogatories, Set One, No. 17.1.
(Motion p. 2:2-7.) No. 17.1 requests additional information for each response
to Rasier’s request for admission that is not an unqualified admission. (Exh. H
[Plaintiff’s responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One].)
Form interrogatories were
created and approved by the Judicial Council to allow discovery into
information regarding an individual’s general background information. A party
responding to these interrogatories owes a duty to respond in good faith as
best as possible. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 783.)
Here, Plaintiff has
provided, in total, three initial or amended responses to Form Interrogatories
No. 17.1. (See Separate Statement pp. 4-20.) These responses provide
extensive information and detail as to nature of the accident, alleged cause of
the accident, Plaintiff’s alleged injuries, medical treatment, providers, and
costs. (Ibid.) Rasier’s most recent set of requests for admissions
contains 362 new requests. (Opposition p. 2:9-13.) Despite this burdensome
discovery request, Plaintiff made a good faith effort to provide responses that
are “as complete and straightfoward as the information reasonably available to
the responding party permits.” (CCP § 2030.220(a).)
Therefore, Rasier’s motion
to compel Cruz’s further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, is denied.
 
Requests for Admissions, Set One
Rasier moves to compel
Cruz’s further responses to Requests for Admissions, Set Two, Nos. 83-84, 290,
330-393, and 396-401. (Joint Decl. ¶ 18.)
Rasier’s motion is denied in
its entirety. 
First, Rasier fails to set
forth No. 83 in its separate statement. Therefore, it is denied. Rasier’s
motion to compel Plaintiff’s further response to Requests for Admissions, Set
Two, No. 290 is denied for the same.
Next, No. 84, which requests
that Plaintiff “[a]dmit that Dr. Stephan Kasimian is waiting to be paid until
the personal injury claim at issue in this [l]awsuit is settled or resolved,”
requests Plaintiff to ascertain the intention of a third party. (See Rasier’s
Separate Statement to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Admissions, Set
Two, (“Separate Statement”) at No. 84.) Plaintiff does not reasonably possess
this information.
The motion is also denied as
to Nos. 330-333, which call for Plaintiff to speculate as to his exact vision
acuity at the time of the accident. These requests call for expert opinion.
(Cal. Evid. Code § 803.)
Further, the motion is
denied as to Nos. 334-393, which ask invasive, and burdensome questions about
Plaintiff’s COVID-19 status from late 2020 through 2024. Additionally, these
questions are irrelevant as the underlying accident occurred in January 2020
before COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic. (See December 20, 2021,
Complaint at ¶ 9.)
Finally, the motion is
denied as to Nos. 396-401 as Plaintiff is unable to recall the side effects
which Rasier inquires about. (See Separate Statement pp. 60-61 and
92-95.)
Therefore, both of Rasier’s
motions are denied in their entirety as their requests are overly invasive,
irrelevant, and burdensome, or because Plaintiff has already responded in good
faith.
 
Monetary Sanctions
“The court may impose a
monetary sanction against a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process, or any attorney advising that conduct” under CCP § 2023.030(a). A
court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone
Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th
771, 791.)
Here, Rasier unsuccessfully
made the instant discovery motions after Plaintiff appeared to respond in good
faith. Therefore, Plaintiff requests monetary sanctions in the amount of
$6,670.00 for Rasier’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, comprised of a $20.00 filing fee and 19 hours of work
at an hourly rate of $350.00. (Oustinovskaya Decl. ¶ 10.) Plaintiff also
requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,995.00 for Rasier’s motion to
compel Plaintiff’s further responses to Requests for Admissions, Set Two,
comprised of a $20.00 filing fee and 8.5 hours of work at an hourly rate of
$350.00. (Ibid.) Considering the lengthy, but nonetheless repetitive,
nature of Plaintiff’s oppositions, the Court awards total sanctions in the
amount of $7,040.00, reflecting $40.00 in filing fees and 20 hours of work at
an hourly rate of $350.00.
In total, for Rasier’s
unjustified and burdensome discovery motions, Rasier and Rasier’s counsel,
jointly and severally, are ordered to pay Plaintiff’s counsel sanctions in the
sum amount of $7,040.00.
 
IV.   
CONCLUSION
Based
on the foregoing, Rasier’s Discovery Motions are DENIED.
Rasier and Rasier’s counsel,
jointly and severally, are ordered to pay $7,040.00 in monetary sanctions to
Plaintiff's counsel within 20 days of this hearing.
Moving
party is ordered to give notice.
