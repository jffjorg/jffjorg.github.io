BACKGROUND
 
On August
2, 2021, Plaintiff Marlo Hempstead (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Game Sports Bar and Grill, LLC (“Game Sports”), Tyrei Lacyt
(“Tyrei”), Sylvia Lacy (“Sylvia”), 5600 Gateway Center, LLC (“5600 Gateway”),
H.B.D. Incorporated (“H.B.D”), Burger King Corporation (“Burger King”), and
Does 1 to 50, alleging five causes of action: (1) negligence; (2) negligent
hiring, training, and supervision; (3) negligent infliction of emotional
distress; (4) assault and battery; and (5) premises liability. The complaint
alleges that, on or about June 28, 2020, Plaintiff got into a verbal
altercation with a security guard employed by Defendants, who then allegedly
shot Plaintiff as he attempted to leave the premises. (Complaint ¶¶ 15-19.) As
a result, Plaintiff alleges serious injuries and damages. (Ibid. at ¶
20.)
 
On April
7, 2023, Game Sports, Tyrei, and Sylvia filed a motion for summary judgment or,
in the alternative, summary adjudication as to each cause of action. The motion
was granted in its entirety on June 29, 2023.
 
On April 11, 2024, Defendants 5600 Gateway and
H.B.D. (hereinafter “Defendants”) filed a motion for summary judgment or, in
the alternative, summary adjudication as to each cause of action. The motion
was granted in its entirety on August 30, 2024.
 
On November 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant motion to vacate judgment granting Defendants’ motion for summary
judgment on Plaintiff’s complaint.


On December 23, 2024, 5600 Gateway and H.B.D. filed
their opposition.
 
Plaintiff did not file a reply.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
“Section 473(b) provides for both
discretionary and mandatory relief [from judgment]. [Citation.]” (Pagnini v.
Union Bank, N.A. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 298, 302.) An application for relief
under this section must be made no more than six months after entry of the
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding from which relief is sought and
must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect of the moving party or its attorney. (Cal. Code of Civ.
Proc. § 473(b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th
130, 143.) Additionally, an application for relief under this section “shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
herein, otherwise the application shall not be granted.” (CCP § 473(b).) Relief
under this section is mandatory when based on an attorney affidavit of fault;
otherwise, it is discretionary. (Ibid.) When dismissal is the attorney’s
fault, the six-month period starts to run from the date of the entry of dismissal.
(CCP § 473(b); Sugasawara v. Newland (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 294, 295.)
DISCUSSION
Evidentiary
Objections
 
Defendants’
December 23, 2024, evidentiary objections are sustained as to No. 1. Plaintiff
claims that he appeared for the hearing on Defendants’ motion for summary
judgment on August 30, 2024, and was told by a clerk that summary judgment was
denied. (Motion p. 1:20-21.) However, the clerk’s alleged statement constitutes
hearsay pursuant to Cal. Evid. Code § 1200 et seq.
 
Defendants’
evidentiary objections are overruled as to No. 2. Plaintiff has personal
knowledge of the general nature of his hospital stays and treatments for his
kidney. (Cal. Evid. Code §§ 70-702 and 801.) Plaintiff does not need to be a
medical expert to understand that he requires surgery. (Ibid.)
 
Statutory
Requirements
 
As a
preliminary matter, the Court notes that Plaintiff failed to include a proposed
pleading. An application for relief under CCP § 473(b) must be accompanied by a
copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein; otherwise,
the application shall not be granted. (CCP § 473(b).) Therefore, the instant
motion must be denied.
 
Nonetheless,
for both parties’ benefit, the Court now considers the merits of Plaintiff’s
motion.
 
Plaintiff’s
motion claims that he “vehemently oppose[s]” Defendants’ motion for summary
judgment. (Motion p. 1:20-21.) However, Defendants’ motion was already heard
and ruled upon at its August 30, 2024, hearing. Any opposition to Defendants’
motion for summary judgment was due fourteen calendar days before its hearing.
(See CCP § 1005.) Therefore, Plaintiff was required to file his
opposition by August 16, 2024. The Court notes that Plaintiff filed a supposed
opposition to Defendants’ motion for summary judgment on November 26, 2024,
nearly three months after the motion was heard. Plaintiff’s motion offers no
showing of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect which resulted in his
failure to oppose Defendants’ motion for summary judgment.
 
 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Therefore, on
both procedural and substantive grounds, Plaintiff Marlo Hempstead’s Motion to Vacate
Judgment is DENIED.
