And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Santa Paseo, Inc., et al. v. CAPREF Paseo, LLC, sustaining Defendant's demurrer to the Third Amended Complaint (TAC). The court finds that Santa Paseo, Inc. lacks standing to bring the claims, as it is not a party to the Lease agreement and has not demonstrated a clear interest in the subject matter of the action. Additionally, the court finds that MrFranchise, Inc. is an improper party to the action, as it was added without permission of the court. As a result, the demurrer is sustained, and leave to amend is denied. The motion to strike is also deemed moot.
