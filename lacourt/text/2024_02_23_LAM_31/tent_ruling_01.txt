DEMURRER
WITH MOTION TO STRIKE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
CAPREF Paseo, LLC
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiffs Santa
Paseo, Inc., and MrFranchise, Inc.
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            This is a breach of contract action.  On October 7, 2021, Plaintiff Santa Paseo,
Inc. (“Santa Paseo”) filed a Complaint against Defendant, CAPREF Paseo,
LLC.¿ 
 
On October 10, 2022, Defendant’s demurrer to the Complaint
was sustained with leave to amend.¿¿ 
 
On February 3, 2023, Defendant’s demurrer to the First Amended
Complaint (FAC) was sustained with leave to amend. 
 
            On
September 23, 2023, Defendant’s demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC)
was sustained with leave to amend.
 
On September 25, 2023, Santa Paseo filed the operative Third
Amended Complaint (TAC), which alleges causes of action for:¿(1) Breach of
Contract; (2) Promise Made without Intent to Perform; (3) Negligent
Misrepresentation; (4) Fraudulent Concealment; (5) Breach of Good Faith and
Fair Dealing; (6) Intentional Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage;
and (7) Negligent Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage.  The
TAC also adds MrFranchise, Inc. (“MrFranchise”) as a plaintiff. 
 
According to the TAC and attached exhibits, on or about
August 10, 2018, Pasadena Mediterranean Food and Beverages, Inc. (“PMFB”),
entered into a lease (the “Lease”) with Defendant.[1]
 PMFB intended to open a Panini Kabob
Grill franchise.  MRFranchise is the
franchising entity for Panini Kabob Grill. 

 
Soon after signing the Lease, PMFB decided it no longer
wanted to pursue a franchise opportunity with Panini Kabob Grill.  As a result, MrFranchise refunded PMFB all
monies paid for the franchise.  PMFB also
assigned its rights to the Lease to MrFranchise in September 2018.  On December 5, 2019, PMFB attempted to assigned
the Lease to Santa Paseo.  
 
Santa Paseo is not a party to the Lease with Defendant.  Nonetheless, Plaintiff (Santa Paseo) now claims
Defendant breached the Lease by failing to deliver possession of the property to
Santa Paseo and failing to complete all the necessary work and improvement
required under the Lease.
 
            On October 27,
2023, Defendant filed this demurrer to each cause of action, and concurrently
filed a motion to strike portions of the TAC.
 
            Santa Paseo
and MrFranchise filed an opposition. 
Defendant replied.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
 
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and
will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on its face.  (City
of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 445, 459.)  “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material
facts properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact
or law.  We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and also consider
matters which may be judicially noticed.  [Citation.]”  (Mitchell
v. California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del
E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 (Del
E. Webb Corp.) [“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true,
however improbable they may be”].) Allegations are to be liberally
construed.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.)  In construing the allegations,
the court is to give effect to specific factual allegations that may modify or
limit inconsistent general or conclusory allegations.  (Financial
Corporation of America v. Wilburn (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 764,
769.)   
 
A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e).) “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a
complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified
under modern discovery procedures.”  (Khoury v. Maly’s of California,
Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)   


Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable
possibility of successful amendment.  (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 348.)  The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that
a pleading can be amended successfully. 
(Ibid.)  
 
III.      JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
            Defendant requests judicial
notice of the following items: (1) Grant Deed recorded with the Los Angeles
County Recorder’s Office on October 27, 2022 as Instrument No. 2022-1024177;  (2) “Business Search – Results” printout from
the California Secretary of State’s website for a search done for the entity
“Santa Paseo, Inc.” on December 28, 2022; and (3) First Amended Complaint filed
by plaintiff in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Case No. 20STCV48603.  The court previously granted these requests in
sustaining Defendant’s demurrer to the First Amended Complaint.  As such, Defendant’s unopposed request is
GRANTED.  (Evid. Code § 452, subds. (c), (d),
and (h); Ragland v. U.S. Bank National Assn. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 182,
194 (taking judicial notice of a recorded deed); Wood v. Superior Court of
San Diego County (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 562, 580 (taking judicial notice of
a government website).)
 
IV.       APPLICATION
            
A.    Meet and Confer   
 
Defense counsel has complied with the meet and confer
requirement.  (See Declaration of Robert
A. Bailey, ¶ 2; Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)  
 
B.    
Analysis  
 
Defendant demurs
to each cause of action on the following grounds: (1) Santa Paseo lacks
standing to bring any of the causes of action; and (2) MRFranchise is an
improper party.  Because the court finds
the TAC is objectionable on these grounds, the court does not address
Defendant’s remaining arguments.
 
Lack of Standing 
 
A.   
Legal
Principles
 
Only a real party
in interest has standing to sue.  (Cloud
v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 1004.)  A real party in interest is one “having an
actual and substantial interest in the subject matter of the action and who
would be benefitted or injured by the judgment in the action.”  (County of Alameda v. State Bd. of Control
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1096, 1103.)  “Someone
who is not a party to the contract has no standing to enforce the contract or
to recover extra-contract damages for wrongful withholding of benefits to the
contracting party.”  (Hatchwell v.
Blue Shield of California (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 1027, 1034.)  Further, “a basic tenet of California
contract law dictates that when a particular right or set of rights is
defined in an assignment, additional rights not similarly defined or
named cannot be considered part of the rights transferred.”  (Heritage Pac. Fin., LLC v. Monroy
(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 991 (Heritage), quoting DC3
Entertainment, LLC v. John Galt Entertainment, Inc. (W.D. Wash. 2006) 412
F.Supp.2d 1125, 1144, emphasis in original.) 

 
B. The
Contract-Based Claims 
 
Defendant argues the
First and Fifth Causes of Action of the TAC fail because Santa Paseo lacks
standing.  Defendant points out that their demurrer to every preceding
complaint was sustained based on these same grounds.  Specifically, in sustaining the demurrer to
the SAC, the court agreed with Defendant that, as alleged in the SAC, the
assignment to Santa Paseo in December 2019 was a nullity because
if MrFranchise “exercised its rights under the Collateral Assignment and took
over the location, then PMFB did not have any rights to assign as of December
5, 2019.”  (9/8/23 Minute Order.)  It is further undisputed that Santa Paseo is
not a party to the Lease Agreement.  As
such, the court compares the allegations of the TAC to the SAC.  
 
Here, the only
differences between the SAC and TAC are as follows:
 
·        
References
to MrFranchise as a party at paragraphs 3 and 4;
·        
Stating
that Santa Paseo and MrFranchise will be referred to collectively as
“Plaintiffs” at paragraph 5;
·        
Replacing
the term “PKG Franchisor” with “MrFranchise” at paragraphs 14-16;
·        
Amending
the allegation at paragraph 15 to read PMFB alone, “exercised its rights under and
Collateral Assignment of the Lease and Consent and Agreement Between Landlord
and Franchisor Regarding Collateral Assignment of the Lease to assign the Lease
to SANTA.”
·        
Unintelligible
allegations at paragraph 16;
·        
Replacing
the term “Plaintiff” with “Santa” in paragraphs 16-30; and
·        
Adding
the following allegation at paragraphs 53, 62, 76, and 86 of the TAC: “on or
about June 5, 2020 and then to Jeff Plauche and Jack Marshall on August 10,
2020 upon being informed by Mr. Taylor he is no longer going to be with
DEFENDANTS...”
 
None of the
foregoing allegations cure the standing defect. 
Exhibit B of the TAC states PMFB “hereby assigns, transfers any assets
over to MRFRANCHISE, INC., a Nevada corporation (“Assignee”) all of Assignor’s right
title and interest as tenant in, to and under that certain lease Agreement
dated August 10, 2018 made by and between CAPREF Paseo LLC”.  (TAC, Ex. B, p. 1.)  Exhibit B is dated September 10, 2018, which
precedes PMFB’s purported assignment of title and interest to Santa Paseo on
December 5, 2019.  Given this chain of
events, Santa Paseo is not the real party in interest.  PMFB assigned its interest to MRFranchise
before again assigning its interest to Santa Paseo.  Santa Paseo has not and cannot cure this
defect. Indeed, Santa Paseo does not address this language in its opposition.
 
Defendant further
argues the addition of MrFranchise as a plaintiff is improper.  The court agrees.  Adding a new party requires the express
permission of the court.  (Shappell
Industries, Inc. v. Superior Court (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1101, 1107.)  Santa Paseo did not seek, nor was it granted,
leave to add additional parties to this action. 
Plaintiffs do not contend with Heritage in its opposition.[2]  
 
            C. Fraud-Based Claims
            
            The Second, Third, Fourth, Sixth,
and Seventh Causes of Action are tort claims sounding in fraud.  Defendant argues Santa Paseo also lacks
standing to bring these claims because the assignment (assuming it was valid)
does not unequivocally transfer a right to bring a tort claim.  The court agrees.  “[A] basic tenet of California contract law
dictates that when a particular right or set of rights is defined in an
assignment, additional rights not similarly defined or named cannot be
considered part of the rights transferred.” 
(Heritage, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at p. 991.)  Absent clear language indicating a transfer
of a right to bring a tort claim under the assignment, Santa Paseo lacks
standing to maintain the Second, Third, Fourth, Sixth, and Seventh Causes of
Action.  No new allegations or arguments
are offered directing a different result. 

 
V.        CONCLUSION
            
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s demurrer to the TAC is SUSTAINED.  As the court indicated in its previous order
sustaining Defendant’s demurrer to the SAC, Santa Paseo had one last chance to
amend the pleading to state a valid cause of action.  Santa Paseo has not done so.  Accordingly, leave to amend is DENIED.  Pursuant to CCP section 581(f)(1), should
either party move for dismissal, the court will dismiss the complaint. 
 
The motion to strike is moot.
 
Defendant to give notice.
