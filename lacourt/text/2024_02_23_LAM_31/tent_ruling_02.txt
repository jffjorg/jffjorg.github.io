[1] Attached as Exhibit A to the TAC.


[2] Even if Santa Paseo were given
leave to amend, Defendant correctly points out that paragraph 5 says Santa
Paseo and MrFranchise will be referred to collectively as “PLAINTIFFs” in the
TAC yet the term does not appear anywhere else in the TAC except paragraph
6.  In other words, there are no
allegations showing MrFranchise is bringing any claims against Defendant.
