AND
RELATED CROSS-ACTION
 
MOVING
PARTY: Plaintiffs 
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers.  No
opposition papers were filed.  Any
opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at least nine
court days before the hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure section
1005, subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs’
complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges: (1) violation of California Civil Code
section1942.4; (2) tortious breach of the warranty of habitability; (3) private
nuisance; (4) Business and Professional Code section 17200; (5) negligence; (6)
breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment; (7) intentional infliction of emotional
distress; (8) fraud and deceit; (9) negligence per se; and (10) violation of
retaliatory eviction and anti-harassment ordinance.
 
On
October 23, 2023, Defendant filed a cross-complaint (the “XC”) alleging: (1)
breach of contract; (2) negligent destruction of property; and (3) intentional
destruction of property. 
 
On
December 26, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a demurrer (the “Demurrer”) on the grounds
that the XC fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action and
is uncertain.  Plaintiffs also filed a
motion to strike (the “Motion”) portions of the XC concerning damages.  
 
As they are unopposed, the
Court SUSTAINS the Demurrer and GRANTS the Motion with 20 days leave to amend.  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
