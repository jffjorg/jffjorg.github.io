Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
Judge: Holly J. Fujie
 



 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Djavid Hakakian (“Moving Defendant”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
 
The Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply papers.
 
BACKGROUND
            On October 20, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a complaint (the “Complaint”) alleging: (1) breach of contract;
(2) promissory estoppel; and (3) declaratory relief. 
 
In relevant part, the Complaint alleges: On or
about July 24, 2018, Plaintiff and Moving Defendant entered into two written
agreements in order to settle a lawsuit. 
(Complaint ¶ 7.)  One of
these written agreements (the “Contract”) included a provision stating that
Moving Defendant would immediately deposit $300,000 with a mutual friend that
would be available for Plaintiff to use in the event that he agreed to settle
another ongoing legal matter (the “Assil Case”).  (Id.) 
In March 2023, Plaintiff entered into a settlement in the Assil Case,
and learned that Moving Defendant never deposited the $300,000.  (Complaint ¶¶ 8-9.)
 
Moving Defendant filed a demurrer (the
“Demurrer”) on the grounds that the Complaint fails to state sufficient facts
to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. 
 
DISCUSSION
Meet and Confer
The meet and
confer requirement has been met.
 
Legal Standard
A demurrer tests
the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law.  (Durell
v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)  The court accepts as true all material
factual allegations and affords them a liberal construction, but it does not
consider conclusions of fact or law, opinions, speculation, or allegations
contrary to law or judicially noticed facts. 
(Shea Homes Limited Partnership v.
County of Alameda (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1246, 1254.)  With respect to a demurrer, the complaint
must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the facts
pleaded.  (Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 513, 517.)  While the allegations of a complaint must be
accepted as true for purposes of demurrer, the facts appearing in exhibits
attached to the complaint will also be accepted as true, and, if contrary to
the allegations in the pleading, will be given precedence.  (Moran v. Prime Healthcare
Management, Inc. (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th
1131, 1145-46.)  A demurrer will be
sustained without leave to amend if there exists no reasonable possibility that
the defect can be cured by amendment.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.)  
 
Demurrers for
uncertainty are disfavored.  (Chen v.
Berenjian (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 811, 822.) 
A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint
is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under
modern discovery procedures.  (Id.)
 
 
Breach
of Contract
The elements of a claim for breach of contract are: (1) the contract; (2)
the plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance; (3) the defendant’s
breach; and (4) damage to plaintiff therefrom. 
(Wall Street Network, Ltd. v. New
York Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.)  The statute of limitations for an action upon any contract, obligation
or liability founded upon an instrument in writing is four years.  (William L. Lyon & Associates, Inc. v.
Superior Court (2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 1294, 1307.)  The
statute begins to run when events have developed to a point where the
plaintiff is entitled to a legal remedy, not merely a symbolic judgment such as
an award of nominal damages.  (McCaskey
v. California State Automobile Assn. (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 947, 959.)
 
            Moving Defendant argues that the
statute of limitations on the breach of contract claim expired before the
Complaint was filed because the Contract was breached when Moving Defendant
failed to “immediately” deposit the $300,000 into an account.  The Court is unpersuaded by this
argument.  As alleged by the Complaint,
Plaintiff was not damaged until 2023 when he tried to access the funds after
settling the Assil Case.  The Court
therefore declines to sustain the demurrer based on the expiration of the statute
of limitations. 
 
            The Court is likewise unpersuaded by
Moving Defendant’s argument that the Complaint is uncertain due to Plaintiff’s
failure to attach a copy of the Contract or the settlement agreement
contemporaneously entered into by the Parties. 
Under California law, a plaintiff may plead the legal effect of the
contract rather than its precise language.  (See Construction Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Insurance Co.
(2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198-99.)  The
Complaint adequately sets forth the legal effect of the Contract and its
relationship to the Parties’ settlement agreement.  
 
            The Court therefore OVERRULES the
Demurrer to the first cause of action. 
             
Promissory
Estoppel
The elements of a promissory estoppel claim
are: (1) a promise clear and unambiguous in its terms; (2) reliance by the
party to whom the promise is made; (3) the reliance must be both reasonable and
foreseeable; and (4) the party asserting the estoppel must be injured by his
reliance.  (US Ecology, Inc. v. State of California (2005) 129
Cal.App.4th 887, 905.)  
 
            The Complaint sufficiently alleges
the elements of a promissory estoppel claim, i.e., Moving Defendant’s promise
to deposit funds, Plaintiff’s reliance on this promise when he settled the
Assil Case, and Plaintiff’s resulting injury. 
The Court therefore OVERRULES the Demurrer to the second cause of
action. 
 
Third
Cause of Action
To
state a declaratory relief claim, the plaintiff must allege a proper subject of
declaratory relief and an actual controversy involving justiciable questions
relating to the party’s rights or obligations. 
(See Jolley v. Chase Home Finance, LLC (2013) 213
Cal.App.4th 872, 909.)  Declaratory
relief operates prospectively, serving to set controversies at rest before
obligations are repudiated, rights are invaded or wrongs are committed.  (Kirkwood v. California State Automobile
Assn. Inter-Ins. Bureau (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 49, 59.)  Thus, the remedy is to be used to advance
preventive justice, to declare rather than execute rights.  (Id.) 
In order to state a proper claim for declaratory relief, the plaintiff
must assert “some recognized or cognizable legal theories” that are “related to
subjects and requests for relief that are properly before the court.”  (See Otay Land Co. v. Royal Indemnity Co.
(2008) 169 Cal.App.4th 556, 563.)  The
fundamental basis of declaratory relief is the existence of an actual, present
controversy over a proper subject.  (DeLaura v. Beckett (2006) 137
Cal.App.4th 542, 545.)  The court may sustain a demurrer on the ground
that the complaint fails to allege an actual or present controversy, or that it
is not justiciable.  (Id.)  
 
            The declaratory relief claim is
based on the alleged breach of the Contract and the harm that has flowed from
that breach.  There are no facts alleged
in the Complaint that suggest the possibility of further breaches or
disagreements of the Contract.  The Court
therefore finds that the Complaint fails to allege a declaratory relief claim
and SUSTAINS the Demurrer to the third cause of action with 20 days leave to
amend. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to
the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on
the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive
an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed
off calendar.
