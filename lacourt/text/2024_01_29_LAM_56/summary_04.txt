Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by Defendant Djavid Hakakian and has made a tentative ruling. The court has considered the allegations in the complaint and the arguments made by both parties.

The court finds that the complaint adequately sets forth the legal effect of the contract and its relationship to the parties' settlement agreement. The court also declines to sustain the demurrer based on the expiration of the statute of limitations.

However, the court sustains the demurrer to the declaratory relief claim with 20 days' leave to amend. The court finds that the complaint fails to allege a declaratory relief claim and that the remedy is not justiciable.

The court sets a hearing date for January 29, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 56. Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court as directed by the instructions on the court's website. If the department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
