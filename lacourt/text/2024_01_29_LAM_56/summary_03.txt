And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs' complaint alleges multiple causes of action, including violation of California Civil Code section 1942.4, tortious breach of the warranty of habitability, and private nuisance, among others. The defendant filed a cross-complaint alleging breach of contract, negligent destruction of property, and intentional destruction of property. The plaintiffs then filed a demurrer and motion to strike, arguing that the cross-complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain.

The judge has sustained the demurrer and granted the motion to strike, giving the defendant 20 days to amend the cross-complaint. The judge has also ordered the moving party to give notice of this ruling.
