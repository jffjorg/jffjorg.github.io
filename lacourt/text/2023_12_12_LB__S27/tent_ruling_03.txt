[1] There
appears to be typographical error in the Notice of Motion as to the Form
Interrogatories Motion, Special Interrogatories Motion, and the Request for
Production Motion as to the amount of monetary sanctions sought. The notices of
motion for such motions indicate that Defendant seeks sanctions in the amount
of $496.50; however, the declaration of counsel in support of the respective
motions attests that Defendant is seeking sanctions in the amount of $469.50
per motion.
