And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District, will be continued. The plaintiff, E.H., has brought an action against the defendant alleging childhood sexual abuse that occurred in 1968. The defendant has argued that it did not know or should not have known about the propensity of the perpetrator, Sterling George Dyer, to sexually assault students. The plaintiff has argued that the defendant was negligent in failing to prevent the abuse.

The judge has found that there are triable issues of fact that need to be resolved through discovery. The plaintiff has requested additional time to complete discovery and complete the record. The judge has granted this request and has continued the hearing.

The judge has also ruled that the defendant's argument that AB 218, a California statute that allows childhood sexual abuse claims to be filed after the statute of limitations has expired, violates due process is without merit. The judge has cited a recent appellate court decision that found that the defendant lacks standing to challenge AB 218 on due process grounds.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is that the motion for summary judgment will be continued to allow for further discovery and to ensure that all relevant evidence is considered.
