And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Tentative Ruling is a decision made by Judge Kerry Bensinger regarding a dispute between Mike Tehrani and Eskan Builders, Corp. (Plaintiffs) and Mehrdad Adjari (Defendant) over a mechanic's lien on a property located at 12428 Laurel Terrace Drive, Studio City, California 91604. The dispute centers around two petitions for release of mechanic's lien filed by the Defendant.

The court finds that the first petition for release of mechanic's lien is moot because the lien was released prior to the filing of the petition. The court also finds that the procedural defects in the petition have not been cured, and therefore, the petition is denied.

As for the second petition, the court finds that the procedural defects are also applicable, and the petition is denied. The court also notes that there is a factual dispute regarding the timeliness of recording the second lien, and this issue is best disposed of by way of trial or summary judgment.

The court grants the plaintiffs' request for attorney's fees in the sum of $850 and orders the defendant to pay this amount within 30 days. The court denies the defendant's request for attorney's fees and finds that the plaintiffs are the prevailing party in this matter.
