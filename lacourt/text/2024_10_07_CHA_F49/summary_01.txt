And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to compel Plaintiff's responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One. The Plaintiff failed to serve a timely response, waiving any objection to the interrogatories. The judge finds that the Plaintiff did not subsequently serve a response that is in substantial compliance with the relevant sections of the California Code of Civil Procedure, and therefore, relief from the waiver is unavailable.

Additionally, the judge grants in part the request for monetary sanctions against the Plaintiff and his counsel. The total and reasonable amount of attorney's fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the motion is $420.00, which includes a filing fee of $60.00. The Plaintiff and his counsel are ordered to jointly and severally pay this amount within 20 days.

The judge orders the Plaintiff to serve responses, without objection, to the Special Interrogatories, Set One, within 20 days.
