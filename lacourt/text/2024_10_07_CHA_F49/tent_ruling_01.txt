NOTICE: OK.

motion is GRANTED. The request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This case arises from alleged injuries sustained by
Plaintiff from an automobile accident that occurred on February 24, 2021.
 
On February 23, 2023, Plaintiff Marvin Ernesto Bonilla
Martinez (“Plaintiff” or “Martinez”) filed the Complaint against Defendants
Madison Lenore Smith (“Smith”), Scott Halsey (“Halsey,” erroneously sued as
Halsey Scott) (collectively, “Defendants”), and Does 1 to 50, alleging two
causes of action: (1) Motor Vehicle Negligence, and (2) General Negligence. Subsequently,
on February 7, 2024, Defendants filed their Answer to the Complaint. 
 
On May 30, 2024, Defendants
filed the instant Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One (the “Motion”). 
 
No Opposition or Reply papers
have been received by the Court.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“If a party to
whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary
sanction. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The statute contains no
time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have been served. All that
needs to be shown in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was
properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired,
and that no response of any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court
(1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)
 
Additionally,
“[i]f a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
response ... [t]he party to whom the
interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce
writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the
interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product...” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)
 
A.   
Motion to Compel
Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One
 
Defendants’ counsel, David
J. Mendoza (“Mendoza”), attests that on March 6, 2024, Plaintiff was served
with the first set of Special Interrogatories by email, establishing that
responses were due on April 9, 2024. (Mendoza Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. “2.”) No responses
were received by the established due date. (Id. ¶ 4.) On May 1, 2024,
Mendoza’s office emailed Plaintiff’s counsel, advising that no responses had
been received and requesting that Plaintiff serve responses, without objection,
by May 6, 2024. (Id. ¶ 5, Ex. “B.”) However, as of the date of filing of
the Motion, Plaintiff has not served any responses. (Id. ¶ 6.) 
 
Based on the above records,
the Court determines that Plaintiff failed to serve a timely response, thereby
waiving any objection to the interrogatories, including those based on
privilege or the protection for work product, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (a).
 
Nevertheless,
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (a), “[t]he court,
on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that
both of the following conditions are satisfied: ¶ (1) The party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections
2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. ¶ (2) The party’s failure to serve
a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect.”
 
Here,
Plaintiff did not file an Opposition to the Motion. Nor did Plaintiff move
separately for relief from the waiver. Additionally, there is no record
indicating any responses have been subsequently served by Plaintiff prior to
the hearing. Consequently, the Court finds that relief under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision(a) is unavailable in this circumstance.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Motion.
 
A.   
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (c), “[t]he Court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust....” 
 
Additionally,
California Rules of Court rule 3.1348(A) further provides, “The Court may award
sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to
compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Underlines added.)
 
The Court finds the mandatory sanction
applies in this case and it determines the total and reasonable amount of
attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with
the Motion to be $420.00, calculated based on a reasonable hourly rate of $180.00
for 2 hours reasonably spent, plus a $60.00 filing fee.
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART Defendants’ request for
monetary sanctions.

Defendants Madison Lenore Smith and Scott Halsey’s unopposed Motion
to Compel Plaintiff Marvin Ernesto Bonilla Martinez’s responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, is GRANTED.
