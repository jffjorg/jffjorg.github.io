```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the complaint is unnecessary. The plaintiff has alleged that the defendant, Cochrane Construction Inc., performed a work of improvement on an exterior deck at a property in Los Angeles, but performed the work negligently. The defendant argues that the claim is time-barred, but the judge disagrees, citing the statute of limitations for latent defects. The defendant also argues that the complaint is too vague and uncertain, but the judge finds that the complaint is clear and specific, and that any ambiguities can be clarified through discovery. The judge therefore overrules the defendant's demurrer and allows the complaint to proceed.
