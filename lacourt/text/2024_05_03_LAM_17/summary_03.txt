And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to quash service of summons and complaint. The plaintiff failed to provide any evidence that the defendant was served at his dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address. The preponderance of evidence indicates that service was defective. The judge urges the parties to attempt informal resolution of issues moving forward.
