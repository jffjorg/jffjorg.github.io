And here is the English text summary:

The Court heard a motion for summary judgment in a case involving a dispute over a lease agreement. The plaintiff, Ave I Group, LLC, alleged that the defendants, Richie P.C. and Equity Partners, LTD, breached the lease agreements and guaranties. The Court granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, finding that the defendants breached the lease agreements and that the plaintiff suffered damages as a result.

The Court found that the defendants breached the lease agreements by failing to pay rent and by failing to deliver possession of the property to the plaintiff. The Court also found that the plaintiff suffered damages as a result of the defendants' breaches, including damages in the amount of $569,554.00 and $202,213.00.

The Court also addressed the defendants' cross-complaints, alleging that the plaintiff breached the lease agreements. However, the Court found that the defendants failed to establish their claims and that the plaintiff was not in breach of the lease agreements.

The Court's decision is based on the terms of the lease agreements, which provided for a "Commencement Date" which was the later of May 1, 2020, or issuance of the certificate of occupancy. The Court found that the plaintiff was not in breach of the lease agreements because it was only required to deliver possession of the property after the Commencement Date.
