English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Hon. Jon R. Takasugi, effective May 3, 2024. The case is between Plaintiff Juan M. Cuarenta and Defendant Claudia Mizutani. Plaintiff, representing himself, filed a lawsuit alleging slander of title, cancellation of instrument, constructive trust, and declaratory relief. Defendant moves for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that Plaintiff's claim is barred by res judicata/collateral estoppel. The Court agrees, finding that the issue of ownership of the property was already litigated and decided in a prior proceeding, and that the Court's decision is final and conclusive. The motion is granted, and Plaintiff's non-opposition to the motion is considered a concession on the merits.
