  vs.
 
CUAUHTEMOC
  TRUJILLO 
 


 Case
  No.:  BC510798
 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: May 3, 2024



 
Defendant’s motion to quash service of Summons and
Complaint is GRANTED.
 
On 6/3/2013, the Best Service Co. Inc. (Plaintiff) filed
suit against Cuauhtemoc Trujillo (Defendant), alleging: (1) breach of contract;
and (2) common counts. 
 
Now, Defendant moves to quash service of Summons and
Complaint. 
 
Discussion

 
            Defendant argues that service of the
Summons and Complaint must be quashed due to lack of personal jurisdiction for
failure to serve Summons and Complaint.
 
 “A defendant . . . may
serve and file a notice of motion for one or more of the following
purposes: (1) To quash service of summons on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction of the court over him or her. . . .”  CCP § 418.10(a). 
A court lacks jurisdiction over a party if there has not been proper service of
process. See Ruttenberg v. Ruttenberg (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 801,
808.    
 
“[C]ompliance with the
statutory procedures for service of process is essential to establish personal
jurisdiction. [Citation.]” (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24
Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.) “[T]he filing of a proof of service creates a
rebuttable presumption that the service was proper” but only if it “complies
with the statutory requirements regarding such proofs.” (Id. at
1441-1442.) When a defendant moves to quash service of the summons and
complaint, the plaintiff has “the burden of proving the facts that did give the
court jurisdiction, that is the facts requisite to an effective service.” (Coulston
v. Cooper (1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 866, 868.) “A court lacks jurisdiction over
a party if there has not been proper service of process.” (See Ruttenberg v.
Ruttenberg (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 801, 808.) 
 
Here, the Proof of Service
states that service was effected on November 17, 2023 by leaving copies thereof with Rosa
Mendoza at 1226 S. Record Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90023.
 
Defendant submitted evidence that his mother is Rosa
Mendoza, and she resides at 1226 S. Record Street. (Trujillo Decl. ¶ 3.)
Defendant submitted evidence that he is 48 years old, and has not resided with
his mother since 2000, prior to being married. (Id. ¶  4.) He stated that “At no time since the
filing of plaintiff's Complaint in this 10 year old case have I resided at 1226
S. Record. My wife and I have four children. I live with my wife and children
in our own residence, not with my mother, and not at 1226 S. Record.” (Id.)
 
            Defendant further states: 
 
Prior to, on and after June 9, 2013, I resided with my
wife and children at 4835 Genevieve Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90041 ("4835
Genevieve"), which is in the Eagle Rock community of Los Angeles. I, my wife
and children all received our mail at our residence at 4835 Genevieve. My
children attended the local schools in Eagle Rock. My oldest daughter graduated
Eagle Rock High School in 2019. My wife, all of my children and I have always
resided together, but never at 1226 S. Record. At this time, we no longer
reside at the foregoing residence at 4835 Genevieve.
 
            (Id. ¶ 5.) 
 
            Defendant’s wife also submitted a
declaration asserting the same. (See Valencia Decl.) 
 
CCP
section 415.20 provides:
                        
(a) In lieu of personal delivery of a copy of the
summons and complaint to the person to be served as specified in Section
416.10, 416.20, 416.30, 416.40, or 416.50, a summons may be served by leaving a
copy of the summons and complaint during usual office hours in his or her
office or, if no physical address is known, at his or her usual mailing
address, other than a United States Postal Service post office box, with the
person who is apparently in charge thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy of
the summons and complaint by first-class mail, postage prepaid to the person to
be served at the place where a copy of the summons and complaint were left.
When service is effected by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at a
mailing address, it shall be left with a person at least 18 years of age, who
shall be informed of the contents thereof. Service of a summons in this manner
is deemed complete on the 10th day after the mailing.
(b) If a copy of the summons and complaint cannot
with reasonable diligence be personally delivered to the person to be served,
as specified in Section 416.60, 416.70, 416.80, or 416.90, a summons may be
served by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the person’s dwelling
house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address
other than a United States Postal Service post office box, in the presence of a
competent member of the household or a person apparently in charge of his or
her office, place of business, or usual mailing address other than a United States
Postal Service post office box, at least 18 years of age, who shall be informed
of the contents thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and of
the complaint by first-class mail, postage prepaid to the person to be served
at the place where a copy of the summons and complaint were left. Service of a
summons in this manner is deemed complete on the 10th day after the mailing.
 
Here, Plaintiff has not submitted any evidence to
indicate that Defendant was served at his dwelling house, usual place of abode,
usual place of business, or usual mailing address. Moreover, Plaintiff filed a
notice of non-opposition. Accordingly, the preponderance of evidence indicates
that service was defective. 
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion to quash
service of summons and Complaint is granted. Given that this motion could have
been avoided by meeting and conferring with Plaintiff regarding service, the
Court urges the parties to attempt informal resolution of issues moving
forward.  
 
It is
so ordered.
