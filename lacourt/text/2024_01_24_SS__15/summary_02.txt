And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively denied the defendant's motion to apply New Mexico law to the apportionment of damages in this mesothelioma case. The judge found that California has a predominant interest in regulating the exposure to asbestos occurring within its borders and in deterring wrongful conduct within California, and that a failure to apply California law would significantly impair California's interest. The judge also found that New Mexico has a legitimate interest in applying its law in this case, but that California's interest is more significant. The judge therefore denied the defendant's motion and ordered the defendant to give notice.
