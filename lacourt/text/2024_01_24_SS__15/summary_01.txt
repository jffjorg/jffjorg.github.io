Summary in English:

The Judge is considering the demurrer filed by Revlon Consumer Products Corporation, which argues that the claims against it are barred by the bankruptcy court's confirmation of its plan of reorganization. The Plaintiffs, Jennifer Mager and John Mandracchia, contend that they did not have adequate notice of the bankruptcy. The Judge is considering the parties' arguments and has granted the request for judicial notice of the bankruptcy court orders. The Judge has overruled the demurrer because it is based on matters outside the complaint. The parties are ordered to meet and confer to resolve the issue of whether the order confirming the plan bars the claims against the defendant.
