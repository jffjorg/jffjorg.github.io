Plaintiff’s
motion for leave to amend to file a FAC is GRANTED.
 
On

Diamond Logistics, LLC and Jairo Pineda, alleging, (1) wrongful termination;
(2) violation of wage and hour laws—unpaid vacation; (3) violation of rest

failure to provide COVID-19 paid sick leave; (10) violation of per diem rates;
(11) waiting time penalties; (12) violation of Business and Professions Code
section 17200; (13) penalties for violation of Labor Code; (14) wrongful
termination; (15) discrimination based on disability; (16) failure to

based on age; (19) harassment based on race/national origin; (20) retaliation;
(21) failure to take all reasonable steps; (22) intentional infliction of emotional
distress (IIED). 
 
On 7/13/2023,
the parties stipulated to set aside Defendants’ defaults entered on 12/29/2022
and 1/12/2023 respectively. 
 
Now,
Plaintiff moves for leave to amend to file a first amended complaint (FAC).
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
seeks leave to amend in order to allege successor-in-interest and alter-ego
liability. 
 
            In
support, Plaintiff argues:  
 
Plaintiff
recently learned that a new company, First Class Evolution Logistics, Inc.
(“FCEL”) is using the assets of FDL and Plaintiff is informed and believes that
FCEL failed to provide adequate or any consideration for FDL’s assets and is
therefore, the successor-in-interest to FDL and liable to FDL’s creditors.
Further, Plaintiff has discovered facts which indicate that there is such a
unity of interest and control between and among defendants, and each of them,
that the individuality and separateness of said entities and individuals, and
each of them, as distinct from the others has ceased and/or never existed in
the first place. Plaintiff contends that adherence to the fiction of the
separate existence of defendants, or any of them, under the circumstances,
would sanction fraud and inequity and promote injustice because in the event
damages are awarded to Plaintiff in this action, each of said defendants will
be unable to respond by way of satisfying any such judgment….
 
            (Motion,
3: 17-27.) 
 
            Plaintiff
notes that the facts supporting these new allegations were not discovered until
10/19/2023, when Plaintiff took the deposition of Defendant Pineda.  
 
The
policy favoring leave to amend is so strong that it is an abuse of discretion
to deny an amendment unless the adverse party can show meaningful prejudice.
(Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.) Here, Plaintiff only recently discovered facts to support
these new claims, and moved without unreasonable delay to add those claims. Trial
is not until 3/10/2025. Accordingly, the Court finds no meaningful prejudice if
leave to amend is granted.
 
Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend to file a FAC is
granted. 
 
It is so ordered.
