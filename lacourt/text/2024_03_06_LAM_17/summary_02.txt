And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint to file a first amended complaint (FAC). The plaintiff seeks to allege successor-in-interest and alter-ego liability based on new facts discovered during a deposition of Defendant Pineda. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not unreasonably delayed in seeking to amend the complaint and that the defendant will not be prejudiced by the amendment. The case involves claims of wrongful termination, violation of wage and hour laws, failure to pay wages, and other employment-related claims. The judge notes that the policy favoring leave to amend is strong and that an abuse of discretion would be to deny the amendment unless the adverse party can show meaningful prejudice.
