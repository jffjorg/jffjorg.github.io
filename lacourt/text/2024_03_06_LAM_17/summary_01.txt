And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has identified several deficiencies with the plaintiff's default judgment packet. The plaintiff must file an updated proposed judgment and adequately address several issues, including the legal basis for recovering damages from Mendiola individually for breach of contract and the relationship between the damages awarded and the settlement agreement. The plaintiff's claims of damages are unsupported by evidence and must be clarified. The court also notes that the plaintiff's application now removes a damages section that was previously included, and that the plaintiff's claims of income loss and cost of permitting property are not supported by evidence. The plaintiff's claims of damages will be denied without further evidence and clarification.
