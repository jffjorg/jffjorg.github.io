The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Tom Lehman vs. Medialab.AI Inc., granting Petitioner's petition to compel Respondent to arbitrate and pay reasonable attorney fees and costs. The Court finds that Respondent committed a material breach of the arbitration agreement by failing to pay the arbitration fees within 30 days of receipt of the invoice. The Court awards $3,280 in fees and $640.20 in costs to Petitioner, which are reasonable and necessary expenses incurred as a result of the material breach. The Court also finds that Petitioner's billing records are mostly reasonable, but notes some minor evidence of padding.
