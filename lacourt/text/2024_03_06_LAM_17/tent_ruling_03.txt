 Case
  No.:  23STCP03563 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  March 6, 2024



 
Petitioner’s petition is GRANTED. The
Court awards $3,280 in fees and $640.20 in costs.
            
On 9/28/2023,
Tom Lehman (Petitioner) petitioned the Court to compel Respondent MediaLab.Ai
Inc. (Respondent) to arbitrate and pay Petitioner’s reasonable attorneys fees
and costs related to his arbitration.
 
            Now,
Petitioner moves to compel Respondent to arbitrate and pay Petitioner’s
reasonable attorney fees and costs related to his arbitration.
 
Discussion 
 
            Petitioner
seeks to compel Respondent to participate in arbitration, and seeks attorney
fees on the basis that MediaLab did not pay arbitration fees within 30 days of
receipt of the invoice and thus is in material breach of the agreement to
arbitrate. 
 
            More
specifically, Petitioner contends that on 6/6/2023, Mr. Lehman filed a demand
for arbitration with JAMS arising out of MediaLab’s failure and ongoing refusal
to pay the retention bonus payment it was required to pay by March 13, 2023.
(Jacobs Decl. ¶ 3). On 6/22/2023, by email to all counsel, JAMS attached an
invoice for MediaLab’s share of the case initiating fees for Mr. Lehman’s
arbitration. (Id., ¶ 4, Exhs. A, B.) On 7/21/2023, JAMS sent an email to all
counsel asking for an update on payment of the invoice. (Jacobs Decl., ¶ 8 and
Ex. C.) MediaLab did not pay the invoice until July 25, 2023, as confirmed over
email by JAMS on 9/15/2023. (Jacobs Decl., ¶ 9 and Ex. D.)
 
            In
opposition, Respondent does not dispute that it paid the requisite fees on
7/25/2023. However, it argues that there has been no material breach, and that
this petition is baseless because the JAMS arbitration is well under way. Indeed,
the instant Petition was filed 65 days after Respondent paid all required
arbitration fees. 
 
            CCP
section 1281.97 has been interpreted as a strict liability statute, given that
it defines the very act of failing to timely pay as a material breach (emphasis
added):  
 
(a)   In an employment or consumer
arbitration that requires, either expressly or through application of state or
federal law or the rules of the arbitration administrator, the drafting party
to pay certain fees and costs before the arbitration can proceed, if the
fees or costs to initiate an arbitration proceeding are not paid within 30 days
after the due date, the drafting party is in material breach of the arbitration
agreement, is in default of the arbitration, and waives its right to
compel arbitration under Section 1281.2.
 
(b)   If the
drafting party materially breaches the arbitration agreement and is in default
under subdivision (a), the employee or consumer may do either of the following:
(1) Withdraw the claim from arbitration and proceed in a
court of appropriate jurisdiction.
(2) Compel arbitration in which the drafting party shall
pay reasonable attorney's fees and costs related to the arbitration.
            As such, despite that arbitration is
now underway, the Court disagrees with Respondent that it has not committed a
material breach. However, the Court agrees with Respondent that the fees and
costs that are awarded for this material breach are only those fees and costs
incurred as a result of the material breach:        
The court shall impose a monetary
sanction against a drafting party that materially breaches an arbitration
agreement pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1281.97 or subdivision (a) of Section
1281.98, by ordering the drafting party to pay the reasonable
expenses, including attorney's fees and costs, incurred by the employee or
consumer as a result of the material breach.
            (CCP § 1281.99.) 
Here, Petitioner submitted a redacted
billing statement which claims $3,960 in fees and $640.20 in costs incurred as a
result of the material breach here. 
While initially the Court intended to
continue the petition to allow for unredacted billing records to be filed, the
Court is persuaded that it can rule based on the unredacted amounts. 
While the Court finds Petitioner’s
billing records to be mostly reasonable, the Court finds minor evidence of
padding, such as the $360.00 billing to calendar a hearing and prepare notices,
and the estimated 3.2 hours to prepare a three-page reply brief with minimal
legal analysis. The Court awards $3,280 in fees and $640.20 in costs. (Gonzalez
v. City of Maywood (9th Cir. 2013) 729 F.3d 1196, 1203)
Based on the foregoing, Petitioner’s
petition is granted. The Court awards $3,280 in fees and $640.20 in costs.
 
It is so ordered.
