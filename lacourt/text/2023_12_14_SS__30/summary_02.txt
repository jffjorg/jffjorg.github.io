The defendant served discovery requests on March 1, 2023, and the plaintiff failed to provide verified responses. As a result, the court has ordered the plaintiff to provide responses without objection within 20 days. The defendant's request for sanctions was denied, as the motions were not opposed. The judge also denied the defendant's request for sanctions under CCP sections 2023.010 for the alleged misuse of discovery, citing a previous court case.
