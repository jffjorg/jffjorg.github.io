And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion for sanctions in part. The plaintiff's counsel, Waukeen McCoy, is ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $720 to be paid within 30 days. The sanctions are a result of the plaintiff's counsel failing to attend and proceed with a deposition of Officer Robert Tamate on September 21, 2023, despite having been served with a notice of deposition on September 6, 2023. The defendant had appeared at the deposition site but was met with a locked door and no one answered despite several knocks. The judge found that the plaintiff's counsel had not justified their failure to inform the defense counsel that the deposition would not proceed as noticed, resulting in a waste of defense counsel's time. The judge also took into account that the time spent on the preparation of the deposition had not been entirely wasted, as the next time the deposition is set, defense counsel will likely spend less than half the time preparing due to their previous preparation.
