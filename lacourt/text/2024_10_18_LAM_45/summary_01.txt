And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court considered a motion to compel further responses from Defendant USA Waste of California, Inc. to special interrogatories, set three. The motion was filed by Plaintiff Joel Artiga, who is seeking further responses to the special interrogatories. The court found that the motion was moot because Defendant provided supplemental responses to the special interrogatories on September 27, 2024.

The court also denied Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,000, finding that Plaintiff's counsel failed to properly meet and confer with Defendant's counsel. The court found that Defendant's counsel acted with substantial justification in responding to the special interrogatories with objections.

Finally, the court denied Defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,740, finding that the motion to compel further responses was not unsuccessfully made. The court ordered that the motion to compel further responses be dismissed.
