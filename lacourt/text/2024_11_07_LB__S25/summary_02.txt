And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Judith Vella. The demurrer is an objection to the legal sufficiency of the complaint, and the judge must assume that all facts pleaded in the complaint are true.

The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the 1st cause of action (assault and battery) is moot because the cause of action has only been asserted against Defendant Juan Antonio Villagomez, not Defendant Vella.

The judge has also ruled that the complaint does not adequately state a cause of action for punitive and treble damages related to the 2nd cause of action (negligence). The judge has sustained the demurrer to the 2nd cause of action with leave to amend, meaning that Plaintiff will have the opportunity to file an amended pleading within 20 days.
