  Case Number:  24LBCV00970    Hearing Date:   November 7, 2024    Dept:  S25 Defendant Tony Dwayne McGee’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff Monica Zuleyma Interiano Paz to Respond to Defendant’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Monetary SanctionsProcedural HistoryOn May 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant Tony Dwayne McGee and Does 1 to 10, alleging motor vehicle negligence and general negligence causes of action. Plaintiff alleges that on September 14, 2022 at Anaheim Street and Neptune Street, Wilmington, California 90744, Defendant vehicle’s right side rig tires collided into Plaintiff’s left rear door. (Compl., at p. 5.) On July 16, 2024, Defendant filed an answer. On July 18, 2024, Defendant propounded Request for Production of Documents, Set One, on Plaintiff. Plaintiff failed to respond by the August 20, 2024 deadline. (Stern Decl., ¶¶ 6-9, Ex. A.) Defendant asserts that although not required to meet and confer prior to filing a motion to compel initial responses, Defendant’s counsel attempted to obtain discovery multiple times, on August 26, September 3, 9, and 10 of this year. (Stern Decl., ¶¶ 10-13, Exs. B-E.) No reply was ever provided from Plaintiff’s counsel. (Stern Decl., ¶ 13.)On October 3, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One. As of November 4, 2024, no opposition has been filed.Legal StandardIf a party to whom document demands are directed fails to respond at all, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a court order compelling answers thereto. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) All that needs to be shown is that the discovery was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. The moving party is not required to show a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the matter informally before filing this motion. A motion to compel initial discovery responses need not show good cause, meeting and conferring, or timely filing, and need not be accompanied by a separate statement. (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The failure to timely respond also waives all objections.¿¿Tentative RulingThe instant motion is GRANTED Plaintiff is ordered to provide objection-less responses to the Request for Production of Documents, Set One, within 20 days from the date of the hearing. The Court declines to award monetary sanctions against Plaintiff in this instance; however, further continued failure by Plaintiff to timely respond to discovery requests or engage in the discovery process may result in future monetary sanctions.Defendant Tony Dwayne McGee’s Motion to Compel Plaintiff Monica Zuleyma Interiano Paz to Respond to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Monetary SanctionsTentative RulingIf a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to respond at all, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a court order compelling answers thereto.

(See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The failure to timely respond also waives all objections.¿¿On motion, a party may be relieved from its waiver of objections if: (1) the party subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance “with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240” and (2) “[t]he party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a)(1)-(2).)Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd. (c), provides that, "[t]he court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust." Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010, subd. (d), provides that a misuse of the discovery process is failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010, subd. (h), states that a misuse of the discovery process includes making or opposing, unsuccessfully and without substantial justification, a motion to compel or limit discovery. A court may impose a monetary sanction against a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process or any attorney advising such conduct under Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a). A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc.
