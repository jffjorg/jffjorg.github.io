 Case Number:  24LBCV01528    Hearing Date:   November 7, 2024    Dept:  S25 BackgroundOn July 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Judith Vella, Juan Antonio Villagomez and Does 1 to 10, alleging assault and battery as well as negligence causes of action. Plaintiff alleges that around October 2022, Plaintiff received threats from Defendant Judith Vella who warned him that she would harm him if he returned to the house on her property. (Compl., ¶ 7.) Plaintiff also alleges that Plaintiff had established a tenancy at the location 336 W 14th Street, San Pedro, CA 90732. (Compl., ¶ 8.) Plaintiff further alleges that on November 1, 2023, Plaintiff, while paying monthly rent for his room, was grabbed by Defendant Juan Antonio Villagomez who broke into the apartment and dragged down the stairs and out the apartment. (Compl., ¶ 9.)On August 28, 2024, Defendant Judith Vela in pro per filed the instant demurrer to the complaint. On October 22, 2024, Defendant Judith Vella filed a substitution of attorney, substituting in Marcella I. Wilson, Esq. from Law Offices of Scott C Stratman as counsel. (October 22, 2024 Substitution of Attorney.) On October 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. As of November 5, 2024, no reply has been filed.Legal StandardA demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party’s pleading. It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purpose of the ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true, however improbable they may be.A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered (i.e., no “speaking demurrers”). A demurrer is brought under Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10 [grounds], § 430.30 [as to any matter on its face or from which judicial notice may be taken], and § 430.50, subd. (a) [can be taken to the entire complaint or any cause of action within]. Specifically, a demurrer may be brought per Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e) if insufficient facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted.Tentative RulingPer Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, Defendant demurs to the 1st and 2nd causes of action on the grounds that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Defendant also demurs to the punitive and treble damages.1st Cause of Action – Assault and BatteryThe 1st cause of action is brought against Defendant Villagomez only and not Defendant Vella. Plaintiff reasons that Defendant does not have standing to challenge this cause of action. The Court agrees with Plaintiff. The 1st cause of action has been asserted only against Defendant Villagomez. Defendant Vella’s demurrer is OVERRULED as moot to the 1st Cause of Action.2nd Cause of Action – NegligenceTo plead a cause of action for negligence, one must allege (1) a legal duty owed to plaintiffs to use due care; (2) breach of duty; (3) causation; and (4) damage to plaintiff. (County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 318.) In California, negligence may be pleaded in general terms. (Landeros v. Flood (1976) 17 Cal.3d 399, 407-408.) “Ordinarily, negligence may be alleged in general terms, without specific facts showing how the injury occurred, but there are ‘limits to the generality with which a plaintiff is permitted to state his cause of action, and … the plaintiff must indicate the acts or omissions which are said to have been negligently performed. He may not recover upon the bare statement that the defendant's negligence has caused him injury.’ [Citation].” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 527.) However, there is no requirement that plaintiff identify and allege the precise moment of the injury or the exact nature of the wrongful act. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support a negligence cause of action. Defendant “demur” to the claim for punitive or tremble damages within the 2nd cause of action (See Compl., ¶ 26.) While arguably more appropriate for a motion to strike, the facts pled in the 2nd cause of action relating to punitive damages are insufficient. Accordingly, the instant demurrer to the 2nd cause of action is SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND.Plaintiff to file an amended pleading within 20 days of the date of this hearing.
