Discussion

 
Petitioner moves
pursuant to Civil Code section 786.88 for an order enjoining Respondent from
continuing violations of the rules of Petitioner’s Mobile Home Park, Twin Oaks
Mobile Home Park (“the Park”), located at 3667 Valley Boulevard, La Verne,
California. (Pet., ¶3.) Respondent’s Mobilehome is located on Space 223 of the
Park. (Ibid.) Respondent’s violations include improperly storing items
outside of their Mobilehome, failing to maintain the Mobilehome and Premises,
failing to maintain the landscaping on the Premises, allowing an unauthorized
and unapproved person to live in the Mobilehome, and allowing that person,
Arthur Gutierrez, to threaten and interfere with Park employees, residents, and
management. (Id. at ¶7.) This conduct violates the parties’ Rental
Agreement at paragraphs 11, and Park Rules at paragraphs B1, B2, B3, B4, B5,
B9, C4, D1, and D18. (Id. at ¶¶10-13.) 
 
Petitioner
requests an injunction against Respondent prohibiting further violations and an
award of reasonable attorney fees and costs. (Id. at pp. 9:26-11:6.)
 
Legal Standard
 
The Mobilehome Residency Law (“MRL”) gives management an
injunctive relief remedy for violations of reasonable park rules and
regulations. (Civ. Code, § 798.88.) Specifically, management may obtain a
restraining order against a continuing or recurring violation of any
“reasonable rule or regulation.” (Civ. Code, § 798.88, subd. (b); Rancho
Santa Paula Mobilehome Park, Ltd. v. Evans (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1139,
1142.) At the time of the hearing, the court shall issue the injunction if it
finds by clear and convincing evidence the existence of a continuing or
recurring violation of a “reasonable rule or regulation.” (Civ. Code, § 798.88,
subd. (d).) The duration of the injunction may not exceed three years. (Civ.
Code, § 798.88, subd. (d).)
 
Discussion
 
Although the moving statute does not provide for a specific
notice period, Respondents are entitled to reasonable notice prior to issuance
of an order on the Petition. (See Menefee & Son v. Dent. of Food
&Agriculture (1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 774, 781.) Failure to give notice is
a violation of due process. (Jones v. Otero (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754,
757.) Petitioner filed proofs of personal service on February 28, 2024 that
state Respondents were personally served on February 27, 2024. (Proofs of
Personal Service, ¶3.) Therefore, Petitioner has provided Respondents with
reasonable notice. 
 
Substantively, the Petition is supported by exhibits
documenting the parties’ contractual relationship and Respondent’s violations
of the Park rules. Specifically, the declaration of the Park co-manager and
attached exhibits demonstrate that Respondents have resided on the Premises since July 30, 2007, pursuant to a written Rental
Agreement. (Pet., Churchill Decl., ¶4 and Exh. 1.) Respondents also signed a
copy of the Park’s Rules when they signed the lease agreement. (Id. at Exh.
B.) Respondents have been in violation of the lease agreement at paragraph 11
and the Park Rules at paragraphs B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B9, C4, D1, and D18
since July 2023 and thereafter. (Id. at ¶¶7, 10, 13 and Exhs. C, E, G.) Specifically,
Respondents have failed to maintain the landscaping, failed to maintain the
Mobilehome and accessory structures in proper condition, improperly stored
items including an unregistered and inoperable motor vehicle outside the
Mobilehome, have an unapproved guest living in the Mobilehome on a daily basis
who threatened residents and the Assistant Manager, and erected unapproved
fences. (Id. at ¶¶4, 12 and Exhs. E-F; Valdivia Decl., ¶¶3-5.) 
 
Petitioner issued two seven-day notices to comply with Park
Rules to Respondents on August 16, 2023 and October 23, 2023. (Pet., Beam
Decl., Exhs. 3-4.) All the violations remain ongoing as of the filing of this
Petition. (Pet., Churchill Decl., ¶11, 13-14.) The Petition, therefore,
provides clear and convincing evidence of Respondents’ violations of the Park’s
reasonable Rules and Regulations. Nor have Respondents filed any response to
the Petition. 
 
Conclusion
 
Petitioner Pomona
Islander, LP dba Pomona Islander Mobile Home Park’s Petition for Permanent Injunction is GRANTED. PETITIONER IS TO FILE A
PROPOSED JUDGMENT WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
Moving party to give
notice.
