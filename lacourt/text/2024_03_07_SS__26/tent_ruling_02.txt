ANALYSIS:
 
On May 23, 2023, Plaintiff Hartford Insurance
Company of the Midwest (“Plaintiff”) initiated
this indemnity and interpleader action against Defendants Robert
Castaneda dba My Town Building and Remodeling (“Defendant Castaneda”), Josefina
Orozco (“Defendant Orozco”), Sally Gonzalez (“Defendant Gonzalez”), Larisa Owen
(“Defendant Owen”), Sareh Nabipour Kasma (“Defendant Kasma”), Chris Fikert
(“Defendant Chris”), and Lisa Fikert (“Defendant Lisa”). Defendant Orozco
answered on June 30, 2023; Defendant Owen answered on August 15, 2023.
Defendants Castaneda, Kasma, and the Fikerts defaulted on December 7, 2023.
Defendant Gonzalez was dismissed on the same date. 
 
The Complaint alleges that this action arises
from a dispute over Construction Bond No. 57BSBIN1134 (the “Bond”) in the penal
sum of $15,000.00. (Compl., ¶13.) Defendant Castaneda
allegedly agreed to indemnify Plaintiff in exchange for the issuance of
the Bond pursuant to an Application and
Indemnity Agreement (“the Indemnity Agreement”). (Id. at ¶¶13-14.) After
the Bond was issued, the remaining Defendants alleged that Defendant Castaneda committed some act that gave rise to
liability under the Bond and now have made claims against the Bond. (Id.
at ¶¶14-15.) Defendant is liable to Plaintiff
for its expenses, costs and attorney’s fees arising out of issuance of the Bond.
(Id. at ¶¶15-16.) 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Deposit
by Stakeholder, for Discharge of Stakeholder, for Attorney’s Fees and Costs, and
for Temporary Restraining Order on February 8, 2024. To date, no opposition to
the Motion has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Interpleader is a procedure whereby a person holding money
or personal property to which conflicting claims are being made by others, or
may be made, can join the adverse claimants and force them to litigate their
claims among themselves. (Code Civ. Proc., § 386, subd. (b).) Hancock Oil
Co. v. Hopkins (1944) 24 Cal.2d 497, 508 (i.e., an escrow-holder who
receives conflicting demands from the parties to the escrow regarding the funds
or documents he or she holds); City of Morgan Hill v. Brown (1999) 71
Cal.App.4th 1114, 1122.)
 
Once the stakeholder’s right to interplead is established
and he or she deposits the money or personal property in court, he or she may
be discharged from liability to any of the claimants. This enables the
stakeholder to avoid multiplicity of actions, and the risk of inconsistent
results if each of the claimants were to sue him or her separately. (Cantu
v. Resolution Trust Corp. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 857, 874; City of Morgan
Hill, supra, 71 Cal.App.4th at 1122.)
 
“An interpleader action is traditionally viewed as two
suits: one between the stakeholder and the claimants to determine the
stakeholder's right to interplead, and the other among the claimants to
determine who shall receive the funds interpleaded ... As against the
stakeholder, claimants may raise only matters which go to whether the suit is
properly one for interpleader; i.e., whether the elements of an interpleader
action are present.” (State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Pietak (2001) 90
Cal.App.4th 600, 612.)
 
The stakeholder may seek reimbursement for its costs and
reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred.  
(UAP-Columbus JV 326132 v. Nesbitt (1991) 234
Cal.App.3d 1028, 1036.) The court may order payment thereof out of the funds
deposited by the stakeholder. (Ibid.) Ultimately, such payment may be
charged to one or more of the adverse claimants in the final judgment. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 386.6.) Finally, the Court may issue an “order restraining all
parties to the action from instituting or further prosecuting any other
proceeding in any court in this state affecting the rights and obligations as
between the parties to the interpleader until further order of the court.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 386, subd. (f).) 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s request for an order depositing the interpleader
funds and to be discharged from liability on the Complaint in interpleader
proper. All Defendants have now appeared, been dismissed, or have had their
default entered. 
 
Substantively, Plaintiff cannot determine the validity of
the conflicting demands that have been made. (Motion, Horowitz Decl., ¶¶4-5.)
Upon deposit of the funds to the court, Plaintiff may be discharged from
further liability. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 386, 386.5.) Furthermore, the fees and
costs sought by Plaintiff are proper. Plaintiff’s counsel has expended
substantial attorneys’ fees and costs bringing this action and protecting
itself from liability. Specifically, Plaintiff’s counsel filed the instant
action and motion, served all Defendants, prepared the instant Motion, will
appear at the instant hearing, will deposit the bond, and has sought to
preserve the surplus funds. (Motion, Horowitz Decl., ¶¶10-11 and Exh. B.) Fees
and costs are awarded to Plaintiff in the amount of $4,931.00. (Ibid.)

Plaintiff Hartford Insurance Company of the Midwest’s Motion to
Deposit by Stakeholder, for Discharge of Stakeholder, for Attorney’s Fees and Costs, and for Temporary Restraining Order is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF IS AWARDED ATTORNEY’S
FEES AND COSTS OF $4,931.00. THE HEARING ON DISBURSEMENT OF FUNDS OR FOR
ORDER ESCHEATING THE FUNDS ACCORDING TO LAW IS SET FOR MAY 9, 2024 AT 8:30 AM
