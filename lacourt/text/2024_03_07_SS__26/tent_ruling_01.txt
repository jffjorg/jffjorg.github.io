FOR SANCTIONS(CCP § 2033.280)

Plaintiff State Farm Mutual

ANALYSIS:
 
On July 31, 2023, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) served Requests for Admissions on Defendant Narineh
Sarkissian Milagerdy (“Defendant”). (Motion, Pleasant
Decl., Exh. A.) Despite a meet and confer effort, to date, Defendant has not
served verified responses to the Requests for Admission. (Id. at ¶¶3-5
and Exhs. B-F.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Deem Requests for
Admission Admitted (“the Motion”) on January 10, 2024. No opposition has been
filed to date. 
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)
Due to Defendant’s failure to timely serve verified responses and resultant
waiver of objections, Plaintiff is entitled to an order deeming the Requests
for Admission admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
 
The Court is required to award sanctions under the moving
statute. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) While properly noticed, the
sanctions sought are excessive. Under a lodestar calculation, sanctions are
granted against Defendant in the amount of $360.00 based on one hour of
attorney time billed at $300.00 per hour, plus the $60.00 filing fee. (Motion, Pleasant
Decl., ¶6.)
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s
Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and Request for Sanctions is
GRANTED. DEFENDANT NARINEH SARKISSIAN MILAGERDY IS ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF
$360.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
