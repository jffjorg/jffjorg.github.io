And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion filed by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company to deem the requests for admission admitted and to award sanctions against Narineh Sarkissian Milagerdy. The defendant failed to serve verified responses to the requests for admission, despite a meet and confer effort, and the plaintiff filed the motion on January 10, 2024. The judge found that the defendant's failure to serve the responses waived any objections they may have had, and therefore, the requests for admission are deemed admitted. The judge also awarded sanctions in the amount of $360.00 against the defendant, which was calculated based on one hour of attorney time billed at $300.00 per hour, plus a $60.00 filing fee. The defendant is ordered to pay the sanctions within 20 days of service of this order.
