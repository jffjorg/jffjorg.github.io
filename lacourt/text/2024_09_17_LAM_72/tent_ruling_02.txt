Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant Rosalie Genus (“Plaintiff”)
moves for judgment on the pleadings as to the Cross-Complaint filed by
Defendants and Cross-Complainants Janet Haywood (“Haywood”) and 8424 Western
Plaza, LLC (“Western Plaza”) (collectively, “Cross-Complainants”).
 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion without leave to amend.
 
Background
 
This is a real property dispute. 
 
Allegations of the Complaint
 
The following facts are taken from the allegations of the
Complaint. The Court does not accept them as true for the purposes of the
motion for judgment on the pleadings. 
The Court recites them for context only.
 
Plaintiff and Haywood are sisters. Haywood owned the real
property located at 10427 S. Denker Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90047 (the
“Property”).
 
In 2007, Plaintiff moved into the Property as a tenant.
 
On January 27, Haywood formed the Western Plaza as an LLC.
On April 7, 2017, Haywood transferred title to the Property to Western Plaza.
 
Plaintiff alleges that on January 25, 2018, Plaintiff and
Western Plaza entered a written agreement whereby Plaintiff would purchase the
property from Western Plaza for $325,000.00. Plaintiff alleges that she complied
with the terms of the purchase agreement. Plaintiff alleges that Western Plaza,
acting through Haywood, refused to sign the necessary documents to close escrow
and thus transfer the property.
 
What followed was a series of lawsuits resulting in
stipulated judgements, each of which provided that Defendants Haywood and
Western Plaza would transfer the property to Plaintiff, and each of which
Defendants Haywood and Western Plaza violated by refusing to sign the transfer
documents.
 
Most recently, in Los Angeles Superior Court Case No.
19STCV39523, the Court ordered on November 29, 2022 that the court clerk would
be appointed as an elisor to execute sale documents on behalf of Haywood and
Western Plaza. Plaintiff brought an ex parte application on May 18, 2023 for an
order directing the court clerk to sign the escrow instructions for the
transfer (the “Escrow Instructions”), which the Court granted. The court clerk
signed the Escrow Instructions.
 
The Escrow Instructions provide for the duties and
obligations of New Era Escrow, Inc. (“New Era”), which include engaging Lawyers
Title Company (“Lawyers Title”) to prepare and deliver to Plaintiff a policy of
title insurance.
 
Plaintiff alleges that she provided the signed Escrow
Instructions to the escrow officer, New Era and to the title company, Lawyers
Title.
 
Plaintiff alleges that Haywood and the Western Plaza
contacted New Era and demanded that New Era refrain from closing escrow to
allow Haywood and Western Plaza to appeal the judgment in Case No. 19STCV39523.
The Escrow Instructions do not provide a grace period for appeal, nor do they
permit a party to unilaterally cancel the agreement. Haywood and Western Plaza
have not posted bond.
 
Plaintiff alleges that New Era refused to comply with the
Escrow Instructions and close escrow.
 
Plaintiff alleges that Lawyers Title has not delivered a
title insurance policy to Plaintiff.
 
Allegations of the Cross-Complaint
 
The following facts are taken from the allegations of the
Cross-Complaint, which the Court accepts as true for the purposes of the
motion.
 
In 2003, Haywood acquired ownership of the Property and
conveyed ownership to Western Plaza. Haywood is the sole member and manager of
Western Plaza.
 
The Cross-Complaint alleges that Plaintiff, who is Haywood’s
sister, became a tenant at the Property prior to 2017 and that the parties
entered a purchase agreement under which Haywood would sell the Property to Plaintiff.
 
The key point on which the Cross-Complaint differs from the
Complaint is the purchase price. Cross-Complainants allege that the appraised
value of the Property was $500,000.00. Cross-Complainants allege that the
purchase contract reflects a purchase price of $325,0000, but that Plaintiff
and Haywood actually agreed to a sale price of $500,000.00. Cross-Complainants
allege that Plaintiff promised to pay Haywood an additional $175,000.00, on top
of the stated price of $325,000.00, after escrow closed. Cross-Complainants
allege that the written contract contained a mistake because it did not include
the additional $175,000.00, and is thus subject to reformation.
 
Cross-Complainants allege that Plaintiff requested this
arrangement because she did not want to take out additional financing to
purchase the property. Cross-Complainants allege that Plaintiff had no
intention to honor the promise to pay the additional $175,000.00. 
 
Cross-Complainants allege that prior to the close of escrow,
Haywood learned from another family member that Plaintiff had told other family
members that she was not going to pay the $175,000 to Janet once title
transferred to Plaintiff’s name. Cross-Complainants allege that Haywood asked
for reassurance from Plaintiff that Plaintiff would pay the additional
$175,000.00, but that Plaintiff ignored the request and demanded that escrow
close.
 
Cross-Complainants allege that on February 1, 2018,
Cross-Complainants and Plaintiff agreed to a set of sale escrow instructions
for the Property. Cross-Complainants attach a copy of escrow instructions dated
January 25, 2018. (Cross-Complaint, Ex. 1.) Cross-Complainants allege that
Haywood would not have signed Exhibit 1 if Plaintiff had not promised to pay
the additional $175,000.00.
 
Cross-Complainants allege that, by seeking to compel
Cross-Complainants to sell the Property for $325,000.00, Plaintiff has caused
Cross-Complainants to suffer damages.
 
Procedural Background
 
Plaintiff filed this action on November 16, 2023. The
operative complaint is now the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), which is filed
against Defendants Haywood, Western Plaza, New Era, and Lawyers Title. New Era
and Lawyers Title were not parties to the previous actions. The FAC raises
claims for (1) declaratory relief (against all Defendants); (2) injunction
(against New Era and Lawyers Title); (3) injunction (against Haywood and
Western Plaza); and (4) specific performance (against New Era and Lawyers
Title). Plaintiff seeks damages from Haywood and Western Plaza, and an order
compelling New Era to comply with the Escrow Instructions and close escrow.
 
Lawyers Title was dismissed from this action on September 5,
2024 pursuant to Plaintiff’s request.
 
On June 17, 2024, Haywood and Western Plaza filed the
Cross-Complaint against Plaintiff, raising claims for (1) reformation of
contract; (2) declaratory relief (as to the sale price of the Property); and
(3) fraud.
 
On August 5, 2024, Plaintiff moved for judgment on the
pleadings as to the Cross-Complaint. No party filed an opposition.

Legal Standard
 
Either prior to trial, but after the time to answer or demur
has passed, or at the trial, the plaintiff or the defendant may move for
judgment on the pleadings and the appropriate ground for such a motion is the
same as that arguable by general demurrer, namely, the failure to state a cause
of action or defense. (Dobbins v. Hardister (1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 787,
791; See also Sofias v. Bank of America (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 583, 586
[The non-statutory motion for judgment on the pleadings can be made at any
time, even during trial, since the grounds for a general demurrer are never
waived.], see also Code Civ. Proc., §438(f).)  
 
A motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same
function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the
face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed. (See, e.g.,
Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (TRG 1998)
§§ 7:275, 7:322; Lance Camper Manufacturing Corp. v. Republic Indemnity Co.
(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 198.) Presentation of extrinsic evidence is
therefore not proper on a motion for judgment on the pleadings. (Id.; Cloud
v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999.) Both a demurrer
and a motion for judgment on the pleadings accept as true all material factual
allegations of the challenged pleading, unless contrary to law or to facts of
which a court may take judicial notice. (Mechanical Contractors Assn. v.
Greater Bay Area Assn. (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 672, 677; Edwards v. Centex
Real Estate Corp, (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 15, 27.) 
 
The motion may be made only after one of the following
conditions has occurred: (1) If the moving party is a plaintiff, and the
defendant has already filed his or her answer to the complaint and the time for
the plaintiff to demur to the answer has expired; (2) If the moving party is a
defendant, and the defendant has already filed his or her answer to the
complaint and the time for the defendant to demur to the complaint has expired.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 438(f).) The motion provided for in Code of Civil Procedure
section 438 may be made even though either of the following conditions
exist:  (1) The moving party has already demurred to the complaint or
answer, as the case may be, on the same grounds as is the basis for the motion
provided for in this section and the demurrer has been overruled, provided that
there has been a material change in applicable case law or statute since the
ruling on the demurrer; (2) The moving party did not demur to the complaint or
answer, as the case may be, on the same grounds as is the basis for the motion
provided for in this section. (Code Civ. Proc., § 438(g).) No motion may be
made pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 438 if a pretrial conference
order has been entered pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 575, or
within 30 days of the date the action is initially set for trial, whichever is
later, unless the court otherwise permits. (Code Civ. Proc., § 438(e).)
 
Discussion
 
Statute of Limitations
 
Plaintiff argues that Cross-Complainants’ claims are
time-barred.
 
Reformation of Contract – First Claim
 
Code of Civil Procedure, section 338 provides for a
three-year statute of limitations for “[a]n action for relief on the ground of
fraud or mistake.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 338, subd. (d).) “The cause of action in
that case is not deemed to have accrued until the discovery, by the aggrieved
party, of the facts constituting the fraud or mistake.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 338,
subd. (d).)
 
Cross-Complainants’ reformation claim is grounded in
allegations that the sale contract contains a mistake as to the sale price. It
is therefore subject to a three-year statute of limitations.
 
Plaintiff filed her first lawsuit regarding the sales
contract against Western Plaza on May 15, 2018. (Request for Judicial Notice,
Ex. A.) Plaintiff filed her second lawsuit, against both Haywood and Western
Plaza, on November 4, 2019. (Request for Judicial Notice, Ex. D.) These
lawsuits specifically alleged that the sales price in the parties’ transaction
was $325,000. Thus, Western Plaza had notice by May 15, 2018 at the latest, and
Haywood had notice by November 4, 2019 at the latest.
 
The Cross-Complaint was filed on June 17, 2024, more than
three years after the latest possible accrual date. This claim is therefore
untimely.
 
The Court therefore grants the motion as to this claim.
 
Declaratory Relief – Second Claim
 
Cross-Complainants seek declaratory relief as to the true
terms of the sale of the Property. This claim stems from Cross-Complainants’
allegation that the written contract of sale states the wrong sale price. The
claim is therefore grounded in mistake and is subject to a three-year statute
of limitations.
 
As discussed above, Cross-Complainants had notice of this
claim by 2019 at the latest, but did not file the Cross-Complaint until 2024.
This claim is therefore untimely.
 
The Court therefore grants the motion as to this claim.
 
Fraud – Third Claim
 
Claims for fraud are subject to a three-year statute of
limitations. (Code Civ. Proc., § 338, subd. (d).)
 
As discussed above, Cross-Complainants had notice of this
claim by 2019 at the latest, but did not file the Cross-Complaint until 2024.
This claim is therefore untimely.
 
The Court therefore grants the motion as to this claim.
