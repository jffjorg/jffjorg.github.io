As for the summary in English text, here it is:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion for judgment on the pleadings brought by the defendants. The defendants had argued that the settlement agreement between the plaintiffs and one of the defendants (FMB Development, LLC) fully resolved all claims between the parties and that the plaintiffs' claims must be dismissed as a result.

However, the judge has found that the settlement agreement only provides for the release of claims stemming from the act of recordation of mechanics liens on FMB's properties, and does not extend to other claims alleged in the complaint, such as breach of contract, conversion, fraud, and creation of fake contracts, checks, and invoices. The judge has also found that the plaintiffs' claims are not inherently bound up in the same business relationship and disputes resolved by the settlement, and that the settlement does not bar the action as a whole.

The judge has therefore denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings and the case will proceed to trial.
