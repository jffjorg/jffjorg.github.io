And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for relief from default. The defendants, including Robert H. Bisno, et al., had been defaulted due to their failure to respond to the complaint. However, they have moved to set aside the default and file a response to the complaint. The judge has found that the defendants' failure to respond was due to mistake or excusable neglect, and therefore grants mandatory relief from default as to all parties except Robert. Robert's failure to respond was due to his own mistake, and therefore grants permissive relief from default to him. The defendants must file their response within five days.
