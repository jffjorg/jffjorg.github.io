The judge grants Plaintiff Rosalie Genus's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the Cross-Complaint filed by Defendants Janet Haywood and 8424 Western Plaza, LLC (Western Plaza). The Cross-Complaint alleges that the sale price of the Property was $500,000.00, not $325,000.00, and that Plaintiff promised to pay an additional $175,000.00. The judge finds that the claims for reformation of contract, declaratory relief, and fraud are time-barred, as they were not filed within the three-year statute of limitations. The judge grants the motion as to these claims, dismissing them. The judgment is without leave to amend.
