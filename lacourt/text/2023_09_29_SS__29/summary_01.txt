## English Summary:

The Judge has ruled that the dismissal of the Plaintiffs' case will be set aside. This is due to their attorney's inadvertent calendaring error, which led to their absence at the original hearing.  

The Judge acknowledged the attorney's mistake and granted the motion, finding it to be within the time limits and justified grounds for relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473. 

However, because the Defendant hasn't been served, the Judge didn't award them any fees or costs.  

As a consequence of the attorney's error, the Judge ordered the attorney to pay $250 to the State Bar Client Security Fund within 45 days.  

The Judge also scheduled future hearings, including one to address the service of process on the Defendant and another for a Trial Setting Conference.
