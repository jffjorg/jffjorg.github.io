This tentative ruling grants the Plaintiffs' Motion to Set Aside the Order of Dismissal entered on January 24, 2023.

The court grants the motion and requires Plaintiffs' attorney David Lederer to pay $250 to the State Bar Client Security Fund within 30 days. The court also sets an OSC regarding service of process on Defendant in approximately 90 days and a Trial Setting Conference in approximately 120 days.
