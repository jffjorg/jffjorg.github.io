## English Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to continue the trial. The trial is currently set for December 30, 2023, but will now be held in early July 2024.  

The judge found good cause for the continuance because the defendant plans to file a motion for summary judgment on April 30, 2024, and the current trial date would prevent the motion from being heard before the trial.  Since no party opposed the continuance, the judge determined that no party would be unfairly prejudiced.

The Final Status Conference and all other deadlines will be reset based on the new trial date.
