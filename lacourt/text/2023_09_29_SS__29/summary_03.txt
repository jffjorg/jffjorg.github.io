And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendant's motion to continue trial from December 30, 2023, to early July 2024. The Judge finds that there is good cause to continue the trial due to the Defendant's motion for summary judgment, which is currently scheduled to be heard on April 30, 2024. As the current trial date would prevent the motion for summary judgment from being heard, the Judge has decided to grant the motion and reset the Final Status Conference and all deadlines to the new trial date.
