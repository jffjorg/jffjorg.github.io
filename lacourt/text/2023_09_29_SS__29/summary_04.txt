## English Text Summary:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the defendant's motion to continue the trial. The trial was originally scheduled for November 20, 2023, but will now be held in late August 2024. 

The judge determined there was good cause for the continuance because the defendant recently filed a motion to compel the plaintiff's discovery responses and a motion for summary judgment. These motions need to be heard before trial, and granting the continuance will allow the defendant sufficient time to address them.

The judge also noted that no party opposed the continuance and that no party would be unfairly prejudiced by the delay.
