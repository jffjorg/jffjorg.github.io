And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendant's motion to continue the trial from November 20, 2023, to late August 2024. The Judge found good cause to continue the trial due to the Defendant's recent filing of a motion to compel discovery responses, which is set to be heard on October 17, 2023, and a motion for summary judgment, which is set to be heard on June 4, 2024. The Judge considered the proximity of the trial date, the length of the continuance requested, and the availability of alternative means to address the problem. No opposition was filed, and the Judge determined that no party would be unfairly prejudiced by the trial continuance. The motion is granted, and the trial date is reset to late August 2024.
