Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge granted the defendants' motion to continue the trial from November 3, 2023, to July 22, 2024. The motion was granted because the parties have not completed discovery before the trial date. The defendants argued that they need additional time to conduct and complete written discovery, and the court found that good cause exists for the continuance. The court also considered other relevant factors, such as the proximity of the trial date, previous continuances, and the availability of alternative means to address the problem. The plaintiff stipulated to the trial continuance, and no party would be unfairly prejudiced by the continuance. The court reset all deadlines based on the new trial date and ordered the moving party to give notice.

The court found that good cause exists for the continuance because the parties have not completed discovery, and additional time is needed. The Defendants have only received responses from two of the six medical providers subpoenaed, and mediation has not yet taken place. The Plaintiff has agreed to the trial continuance, which the Judge finds will not unfairly prejudice either party. As a result, all deadlines and the trial date will be reset, and a new Final Status Conference will be scheduled based on the new trial date.
