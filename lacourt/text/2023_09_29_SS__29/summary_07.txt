And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion filed by S. Martin Keleti to be relieved as counsel for plaintiffs Jora, Janet, and Vredj Malaky. The motion is continued for approximately 30 days due to incomplete proposed orders and an internally inconsistent attorney declaration. The court finds that the proposed orders do not set forth all upcoming dates for hearings or other proceedings, and the attorney declaration is inconsistent regarding communication with the clients. The judge orders the moving counsel to file an updated declaration and proposed order for each motion and to give notice. The determination of whether to grant or deny the motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, and the court may delay the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
