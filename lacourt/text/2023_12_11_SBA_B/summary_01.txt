Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Gary Y. Tanaka on Plaintiff Amber Quarles' motion to unseal the Court record in the case of Amber Quarles v. Michael Bark, et al. The case is a residential unlawful detainer action relating to property located at 626 Rosecrans Avenue, Manhattan Beach, California. The parties settled and agreed to a stipulated judgment, but the defendants breached the settlement agreement. Judgment for possession was entered for the plaintiff, and a writ of possession was issued. The plaintiff then obtained a money judgment in the amount of $129,822.77.

The plaintiff moves to unseal the Court record in its entirety, citing California Civil Procedure Code, ยง 1161.2, which allows for access to limited civil case records after 60 days have elapsed since the complaint was filed and judgment has been entered. The court considers the same matters as on a motion to seal the record and finds that the plaintiff has made a competent showing that there is no overriding interest that overcomes the public right of access to the Court record. Therefore, the court grants the plaintiff's motion to unseal the record.
