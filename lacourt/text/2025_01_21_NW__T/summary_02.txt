And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel production of documents. The defendant must provide the plaintiff with copies of certain documents within 20 days of the order. These documents include purchase or lease contracts, work orders, repair orders, and invoices related to the subject vehicle, as well as records of communications with dealer personnel and warranty claims. The defendant must also provide a list of customer complaints that are substantially similar to the defects claimed by the plaintiff, as well as technical service bulletins and recall notices for vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the subject vehicle. The documents may be provided in electronic form as a PDF at the option of the producing party. If a party believes any of this information should be subject to a protective order, they must first meet and confer with the opposing party and then file a motion for a protective order if necessary.
