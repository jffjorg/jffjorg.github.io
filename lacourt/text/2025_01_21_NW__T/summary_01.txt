And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge grants Defendant Tesla Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration and stay the action. The motion was filed without opposition from the Plaintiff, Kamran Khorshidian. The Judge finds that the parties have entered into two arbitration agreements, the Motor Vehicle Order Agreement (MVOA) and the Retail Installment Sale Contract (RISC), which include broad arbitration provisions that encompass the claims alleged in the Complaint. The Judge concludes that the Defendant has met its burden to show that the claims are subject to arbitration, and therefore grants the motion to compel arbitration and stay the action. An Arbitration Status Conference is set for January 21, 2026, at 8:30 a.m., with mandatory appearance unless judgment or dismissal has been entered.
