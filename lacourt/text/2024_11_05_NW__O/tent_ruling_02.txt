  CASE NO.: 24VECV03613 
 
ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S APPLICATIONS FOR
  RIGHT TO ATTACH ORDERS AND FOR ORDERS FOR ISSUANCE OF WRIT OF ATTACHMENT
 
 



 


 
I.              
INTRODUCTION
This case arises out of Defendants Peter Mehrian (“Mehrian”), Project X
Group LLC (“Project X”)(collectively, “Defendants”), and Renee Cohen’s alleged
failure to repay a loan issued to them by Plaintiff for $100,000.00, inclusive
of accrued interest. (See Complaint, ¶ 11.) Plaintiff alleges Defendants
have only paid $3,800.00 of their $100,000.00 loan and thus still owe Plaintiff
$96,200.00. (See id. at ¶¶ 12, 14.) 
Plaintiff now applies to this Court for an order for issuance of a writ
of attachment against Defendants. 
II.      PROCEDURAL
HISTORY
          On
July 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed his Complaint, alleging (1) Breach of Contract;
(2) Promise without Intent to Perform; (3) Intentional Misrepresentation; and
(4) Negligent Misrepresentation.
          On
September 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Application for Right to Attach
Order and Writ of Attachment as against Defendants. 
          On
September 30, 2024, Defendants and Cohen filed their Answer. 
III.     LEGAL
STANDARD
For the court to issue a right to attach order and order for
issuance of a writ of attachment, it must be established that: (1) the claim
upon which the attachment is based is one upon which an attachment may be
issued; (2) the applicant has established the probable validity of the claim upon
which the attachment is based; (3) the attachment is not sought for a purpose
other than the recovery of the claim upon which the attachment is based; and
(4) the amount to be secured by the attachment is greater than zero. (See Code
Civ. Proc. § 484.090(a).)[1] Additionally, when the defendant is a natural person, the
property's description in the writ of attachment must be detailed enough to
enable the defendant to identify the specific property sought to be attached,
whereas in cases of corporate defendants, simply stating “all corporate
property subject to attachment as per subdivision (a) of Code of Civil
Procedure Section 487.010” is sufficient to meet the legal requirements for
describing the property. (Code Civ. Proc. § 484.020(e).)
To
satisfy the first element, a writ of attachment may be issued only if the claim
sued upon is a claim for money based upon an express or implied contract, where
the total amount of the claim is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount of at
least $¿500 exclusive of costs, interest, and
attorney fees. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 483.010(a).) “Readily ascertainable” refers to the ability
to easily determine damages resulting from a breach of contract by referencing
the contract, where the method for calculating such damages is reasonable and
definite. (See CIT v. Super DVD, Inc. (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 537, 540.) 
A writ
of attachment may not be issued on a claim that is secured by a real property
interest arising from an agreement, statute, or other rule of law. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 483.010(b).)
Further, an attachment can be issued on a guarantee irrespective of whether the
principal loan is secured, provided that the guarantor has waived the right to
require the creditor to proceed against the collateral first. (See United Cent. Bank v. Superior Ct. (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 212, 215-16.) Lastly,
if the
writ of attachment is against a defendant who is a natural person, the claim
upon which the action is based has to arise out of the conduct by the defendant
of a trade, business, or profession. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 483.010(c).)
The requirement
regarding probable validity is met when it is more
probable than not that the plaintiff will secure a judgment against the
defendant regarding the claim in question. (See Code Civ. Proc. §
481.190.) To assess the probable validity of a claim, the court must evaluate
the sufficiency and weight of the plaintiff's evidence against that of the
defendant's, contemplating the relative legal stances of the parties involved
to
determine the probable outcome of the
litigation. (See Loeb & Loeb v. Beverly Glen Music, Inc. (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 1110,
1120.)
IV.     ANALYSIS
          Plaintiff has submitted two Applications for a Right to
Attach Order and Writ of Attachment: one as against Project X (“Project X
Application”) and one as against Mehrian (“Mehrian Application”) as an
individual/natural person. The Court will address both Applications together. 
A.            
Plaintiff’s Claims Are Ones
Upon Which Attachments May Issue
To meet the conditions for a writ of
attachment under Code of Civil Procedure § 483.010,
Plaintiff must show his claims against Defendants are: (a) based
upon an express or implied contract, where the total amount of the claim is a
fixed or readily ascertainable amount of at least $¿500 exclusive of costs, interest, and
attorney’s fees; (b) not
secured by any interest in real property; 
and (c) rising from Defendants’ conduct of a trade, business, or
profession (with regard to Individual Defendants who are natural persons).
Here,
Plaintiff has provided the Promissory Note (“Note”) between Plaintiff and Mehrian
and Project X, which states “Borrower shall pay a lump sum to be made in-full,
principal and interest included, of One hundred thousand Dollars ($100,000.00).”
(Declaration of David Partiel filed September 16, 2024 (“Partiel Decl.”), ¶ 2,
Ex. A.) Plaintiff declares the Note is only facially secured by real property but
that “[t]he claims upon which this action is brought against Defendant are not
secured by any mortgage, deed of trust, or lien on real or personal property or
any pledge of personal property” as Defendants “never executed a deed of trust
or any other instrument for which I can formally secure the property.” (Partiel
Decl., ¶ 5.) 
The
Court thus finds Plaintiff’s claims total a fixed and readily ascertainable
amount of $500.00 exclusive of costs, interest, and attorney’s fees and are not
secured by any interest in real property. The Court also finds they arise from
Mehrian’s conduct of a trade, business, or profession. Though not addressed in
Plaintiff’s declaration, Mehrian is listed as the Borrower alongside Project X
in the Note; Mehrian also signed the Note as the Borrower. (See Partiel
Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.) Plaintiff also declares that “Defendants Project X and
Mehrian executed an agreement…wherein we memorialized money in the amount of $70,000.00
lent by me to [Defendants]…back in 2019,” and checked the box in his Mehrian Application
which states “Plaintiffs claim or claims arise out of conduct by the defendant
who is a natural person of a trade, business, or profession.” (Id.; Mehrian
Application, ¶ 6(a).) 
Accordingly,
the Court finds Plaintiff’s claims against Project X and Mehrian are ones upon
which attachment may issue.
B.            
Plaintiff Has Established the Probable
Validity of His Claims
A
court may issue a writ of attachment only if the plaintiff's claim has probable
validity. The “probable validity” standard is achieved when it is more likely
than not that the plaintiff will prevail in the lawsuit against the defendant
on the specific claims. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 481.190; see also Kemp
Bros. Constr., Inc. v. Titan Elec. Corp. (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474, 1476.)
To decide on the probable validity, the court examines both the strength and
the persuasiveness of the evidence presented by the plaintiff in comparison to
the defendant's, taking into account the legal positions of each side to
foresee the most likely outcome of the case. (Kemp Bros., 146
Cal.App.4th at 1481-82; Loeb & Loeb, 166 Cal.App.3d at 1120.) 
For
its part, the creditor applying for attachment must “follow[] the statutory
guidelines and establish[] a prima facie claim to have a debtor’s assets seized
and held until final adjudication at trial.” (Lorber Industries v.
Turbulence, Inc. (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 532, 535.) “The plaintiff has the
burden of establishing the probable validity of the claim upon which the
attachment is based.” (Rreef America Reit II Corp, YYYY v. Samsara Inc.
(2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 609, 617.) “Probable validity means ‘it is more likely
than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant on
that claim.’” (Park v. NMSI, Inc. (2023) 96 Cal.App.5th 346, 354 (quoting
Code Civ. Proc. §¿481.190).)
The application for a writ of attachment must be supported “by an affidavit
showing that the plaintiff on the facts presented would be entitled to a
judgment on the claim upon which the attachment is based.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
484.030.)
Here,
Plaintiff has submitted evidence established the probable validity of his
claims. Plaintiff’s declaration is signed under penalty of perjury and details
the following: (1) Plaintiff and Defendants executed the Note (discussed above
and attached by Plaintiff to his declaration) on February 6, 2024; (2) in May
and June of 2024, Defendants paid $3,800.00 of the amount owed under the Note; and
(3) Defendants have not made any additional payments and thus still owe $96,200.00
under the Note. (See Partiel Decl., ¶¶ 2-4, Ex. A.)  
Defendants
do not oppose. 
Accordingly,
the Court finds Plaintiff has established the probable validity of his claims. 
C.            
Plaintiff is Not Seeking the
Attachments for a Purpose Other Than Recovery of the Claims Upon Which They Are
Based
To issue a right to attach order, the court must find that
“[t]he attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the
claim upon which the attachment is based.” (Code Civ. Proc. §¿484.090(a)(3).)
Plaintiff declares “attachment is not sought a purpose other
than the recovery on a claim upon which the attachment is based.” (Partiel
Decl., ¶ 7.) 
          Accordingly, the Court finds Plaintiff is not seeking the
attachment for a purpose other than recovery of the claims upon which they are
based.  
D.           
The Amount to Be Secured is
Greater Than Zero
To issue a right to attach
order, the court must find that “[t]he amount to be secured by the attachment
is greater than zero.” (Code Civ. Proc. §¿484.090(a)(4).) The amount
to be secured by an attachment is the sum of the following: (1) the amount of
the defendant's indebtedness claimed by the plaintiff; and (2) any additional
amount included by the court under Code of Civil Procedure § 482.110. (See Code
Civ. Proc. § 483.015(a).) 
Code of Civil Procedure §
482.110 in turn states “[t]he plaintiff's application for a right to attach
order and a writ of attachment pursuant to this title may include an estimate
of the costs and allowable attorney's fees.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 482.110(a).) Reasonable
attorney’s fees are calculated pursuant to Local
Rules, rule 3.214. 
In addition to Defendants’ alleged
indebtedness, discussed above, Plaintiff seeks $5,118.00 in attorney’s fees, $435.00
in costs, and $5,982.85 in accrued interest, as specifically allowed under the
terms of the Note. (See Declaration of K. Tom Kohan filed September 16,
2024, ¶¶ 3-6.) In total, Plaintiff seeks to secure via the attachment
$107,240.85, an amount greater than zero. (See Memorandum of Points and
Authorities, pg. 6; see also Mehrian Application, ¶ 8; Project X
Application, ¶ 8.)  
Accordingly, the Court finds the amount to be
secured by the attachment sought in the Applications is greater than zero. 
E.            
The Properties Plaintiff Seeks to Attach Are
Subject to Attachment

An
application for a right to attach order must include a “description of the
property to be attached under the writ of attachment and a statement that the
plaintiff is informed and believes that such property is subject to attachment.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 484.020(e).) If the defendant is a corporation “a reference
to ‘all corporate property which is subject to attachment pursuant to
subdivision (a) of Code of Civil Procedure Section 487.010’ satisfies the
requirements of this subdivision.” (See id.) 
When
the defendant is a natural person, “the description of the property shall be
reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the specific property
sought to be attached.” (Id.) However, while the property sought to be
attached must be specifically described in detail, an overly inclusive description
in the attachment application does not invalidate
it, so the plaintiff may attempt to attach everything the individual defendant
owns. (See Bank of America
v Salinas Nissan, Inc. (1989) 207
Cal.App.3d 260, 268.) Listing all of the following categories of properties,
such as “real property, personal property, equipment, motor vehicles, chattel
paper, negotiable and other instruments, securities, deposit accounts, safe
deposit boxes, accounts receivables, general intangibles, property subject to
pending actions, final money judgments, and personal property in decedents'
estates” is sufficient to support an order granting the right to attach whatever assets defendant owns that fall in those categories. (Id.)  
The
properties Plaintiff seeks to attach are subject to attachment. In his Project
X Application, Plaintiff checks box 9(a) and has thus satisfied the
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure § 484.020(e) as to Project X. (See Project
X Application, ¶ 9(a).) In his Mehrian Application, Plaintiff checks box 9(c)
and attaches a list of the specific properties he seeks to attach. (See Application.
¶ 9(c), Attachment.) Plaintiff’s attached description is reasonably adequate to
inform Mehrian what specific property he seeks to attach. 
Accordingly,
the Court finds the properties Plaintiff seeks
to attach are subject to attachment. 
F.             
Plaintiff Must File an Undertaking of $10,000
Code of Civil Procedure § 489.210 provides
that before issuance of a writ of attachment, “the plaintiff shall file an
undertaking to pay the defendant any amount the defendant may recover for any wrongful
attachment by the plaintiff in the action.” In addition, Code of Civil
Procedure § 489.220 provides “the amount of an undertaking filed pursuant to
this article shall be ten thousand dollars ($10,000).” 
Accordingly, the Court orders Plaintiff to
file an undertaking in the amount of $10,000.
V.       CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the Court hereby
GRANTS Plaintiff’s Applications for Right to Attach Orders and for Orders for
Issuance of Writ of Attachment as against Project X and Mehrian. 
The Court also orders Plaintiff to file an
undertaking in the amount of $¿10,000 before the writs shall issue. (See Code
Civ. Proc. § 489.220.)
