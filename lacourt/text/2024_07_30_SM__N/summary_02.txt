And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants Defendant David Loomstein's motion for leave to amend the answer to add affirmative defenses, including First Amendment, Protected Opinion, Statements Were True, Communications Decency Act, Failure to State a Claim for Punitive Damages, No Malice, Oppression, or Fraud, and Punitive Damages Unconstitutional. The Court finds that amendment is proper because the affirmative defenses do not raise new issues that are new to the Plaintiff, and the Defendant swiftly moved to amend once it became aware of the omission. The Court favors trial on the merits and amendment where proper.
