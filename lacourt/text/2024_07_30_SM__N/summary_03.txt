And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendants' motion to recover fees and costs in the amount of $206,555.20. The defendants moved for an award of attorney fees after winning a special motion to strike, which the court granted on January 25, 2024. The court found that the work performed by the defendants' attorneys was reasonable and necessary to prevail on the motion, and that the defendants are entitled to recover attorney fees for certain subsequent motions relating to the special motion to strike. The court cited the purpose of the fee-shifting provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c), which is to compensate the prevailing defendant for the undue burden of defending against litigation designed to chill the exercise of free speech and petition rights. The court ordered the defendants to give notice and awarded costs pursuant to statute.
