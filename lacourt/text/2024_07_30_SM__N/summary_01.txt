And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to bifurcate the trial, which means that the plaintiff will not be allowed to introduce evidence related to the defendants' financial condition until after the jury has returned a verdict in the plaintiff's favor and found the defendants guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud. The judge made this decision based on California Civil Code section 3295, which requires that evidence of a defendant's profits or financial condition be excluded until after the plaintiff has been awarded actual damages and the defendant has been found guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud. The judge also noted that bifurcation is proper in this case because it will avoid prejudice and promote expedition and economy in the trial.
