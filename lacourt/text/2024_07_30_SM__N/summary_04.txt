Summary in English:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that Defendant Gourmandise Paris Inc.'s Demurrer to Plaintiff Brian Whitaker's Complaint is overruled, and its Motion to Strike Portions of the Complaint is denied. The Judge finds that Plaintiff has standing to bring this claim and has sufficiently alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Unruh Civil Rights Act. The Judge also rejects Defendant's contention that Plaintiff has not alleged that he was actually denied rights by Defendant, stating that whether Plaintiff has suffered damages or was denied access is a matter of fact for the jury's determination. The Judge orders Defendant to file and serve an answer to the Complaint within 10 days of the entry of this order.
