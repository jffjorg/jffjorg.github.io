Here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants the motion for leave to file the First Amended Cross-Complaint, filed by 7-Eleven, Inc. The motion seeks to revise the Declaratory Relief cause of action and substitute Contractual Indemnity and Breach of Lease Agreement causes of action against Paul Paik and Lae Oh Paik, the owners of the shopping center where the 7-Eleven store is located. The motion is unopposed and the Judge finds no prejudice will result if leave is granted. The Judge notes that the proposed amendment complies with the requirements of California Rules of Court and that the motion is granted as a matter of liberal amendment policy. The Judge orders 7-Eleven to file the attached amended cross-complaint within 10 days of the order.
