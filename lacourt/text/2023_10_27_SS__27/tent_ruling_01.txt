CASE:                                Lucero Santos, et al. v. Roosevelt Brown, II
 
CASE NO.:                 19STCV23118
 





















 
PETITION
TO APPROVE MINOR’S COMPROMISE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Petitioner
Lucero Santos
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition 
 
 
            Claimant,
Abby Cortes, a minor, by and through her parent and guardian ad litem, Petitioner,
Lucero Santos, has agreed to settle her claims against Defendant Roosevelt Brown, II in
exchange for $17,500.
 
            On
June 14, 2023, the Court rejected the Petition because (1) there were
inconsistencies on Form MC-350 regarding the request for medical costs and
Claimant’s settlement balance, (2) Petitioner had not filed an Order to Deposit
Funds Into Blocked Account (Form MC-355), (3) Petitioner did not include Attachment
19b(2) indicating to which financial institution the settlement proceeds were
to be deposited, and Petitioner had not submitted a proposed Order Approving
the Petition (Form MC-351).
            
            On
July 3, 2023, Petitioner filed an Order to Deposit Funds Into Blocked Account
(Form MC-355) and a proposed Order Approving the Petition (Form MC-351).  The Court reviewed the filing on July 13, 2023
and found that the Petition could not be approved because (1) Petitioner did not file a new Petition consistent with Forms
MC-355 and MC-351, and (2) Items 6, 10,
and 11 of Form MC-351 had not been completed.
 
            On
August 7, 2023, Petitioner filed an amended Petition.  The Court reviewed the filing on August 28,
2023 and found that the Petition could not be approved because it was not clear
from the Petition whether the settlement balance was to be deposited in a
blocked account or invested in an annuity.  Specifically, Petitioner had selected Item
19b(3) to indicate the settlement balance was to be invested in an
annuity.  However, Form MC-355 indicated
the settlement balance was to be deposited in a blocked account.  Moreover, Petitioner had not provided
information for either the purchase of an annuity or the financial institution
where the money was to be deposited. 
 
 
            On
September 14, 2023, Petitioner filed an amended Petition.  The Court could not grant the Petition
because it contained the same defects as the previous Petition.
 
            On
October 9, 2023, Petitioner filed another amended Petition.  If approved, $6,312.50 will be used for medical
expenses, leaving a settlement balance of $11,187.50 for Claimant, to be
deposited at American Business Bank in Los Angeles, California, subject to
withdrawal only on authorization of the court. 
Counsel has waived attorney’s fees.
 
            Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc. § 372.)  The petition must be verified and “must
contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing on the
reasonableness of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition.”¿ (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)¿¿
            
            Petitioner
has cured the defects noted in the Court’s previous orders.  The motion complies with California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362. 
 
            Accordingly,
the Petition is GRANTED.  The Court sets
an OSC re: Proof of Deposit (minor –Abby Cortes) for December 15, 2023 at 8:30
a.m.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 7.953, subd. (a).)¿ If an acknowledgement of
receipt by the financial institution is filed before that date, no appearance
will be required.¿¿ 
 
            The OSC Re:
Dismissal (Settlement) – Conditional as to Entire Action is CONTINUED to
December 15, 2023 at 8:30 a.m.  The OSC
Re: Sanctions of $250 is DISCHARGED.
 
Moving party to give notice.
