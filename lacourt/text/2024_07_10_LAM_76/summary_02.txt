Here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling in this case is that the motion to seal documents filed by Air Vent, Inc. is DENIED. The Court found that there was an overriding interest in sealing the documents, which was based on a binding contractual agreement not to disclose. However, the Court also found that the proposed sealing was not narrowly tailored and that no less restrictive means existed to achieve the overriding interest. The Court ordered Air Vent, Inc. to notify the Court within 10 days as to whether the documents shall be filed unsealed.

The hearing on the motion to quash service of summons filed by Powermax Electric Co. Ltd. Guandong is continued to August 2, 2024. The Court ruled that the motion to seal and the motion to quash were intertwined and that the ruling on the motion to seal would affect the unsettled status of the opposition brief and supporting evidence in the motion to quash.
