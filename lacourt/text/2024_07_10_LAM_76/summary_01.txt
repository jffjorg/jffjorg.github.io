And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for relief from the deadline to file the motion for attorney fees incurred on appeal. The motion was filed on May 30, 2024, and the judge finds that the late filing was caused by counsel's mistake of law, which constitutes good cause for relief. The judge notes that the drafters of the California Rules of Court intended for the "good cause" exception to be liberally interpreted, and that a reasonable mistake of law, even if caused by counsel's negligence, is a valid ground for relief. The judge also rejects the contention that a rule 3.1702(d) extension of time must be granted before the expiration of the 60-day period. The judge finds that the one-day calendaring error by counsel constitutes good cause for a one-day extension of the deadline. The motion for relief is granted, and the attorney's fees motion filed on May 30, 2024 is deemed to have been timely filed.
