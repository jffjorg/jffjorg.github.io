The plaintiff's motion to compel further responses covers additional requests that were not included in the previous agreement. The judge has also denied the defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiff.

The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for certification of appeal, as it was made for the first time in the reply and the defendant has not had an opportunity to respond. The judge notes that the parties had agreed to extend the deadline for moving to compel further responses, but only for certain requests, and that the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses covers additional requests that were not included in the previous agreement.

Overall, the judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses because it is untimely, and has also denied the defendant's request for sanctions and the plaintiff's request for certification of appeal.

## English Summary

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Plaintiff to compel further responses to certain discovery requests from Defendant. The Judge found that Plaintiff's motion was untimely because the deadline for filing motions to compel regarding those specific discovery requests had passed. 

While Plaintiff argued that the parties had agreed to extend the deadline for all discovery requests, the Judge found no evidence to support that claim and emphasized that the prior agreement only applied to specific requests. 

Defendant's request for sanctions against Plaintiff was denied because they did not properly request sanctions in their initial opposition to the motion. 

Finally, Plaintiff's request to certify the case for an immediate appeal was denied without prejudice, meaning Plaintiff can re-file the request after providing Defendant an opportunity to respond.

Summary:
The tentative ruling relates to Case Number 22STCV22459, scheduled for a hearing on September 25, 2023, in Dept 31. The Judge denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production, Set One, Nos. 5, 7, and 10 as untimely. Defendants’ request for sanctions is also denied. Plaintiff’s request for certification of appeal pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 166.1 is denied without prejudice.

The legal standard for compelling a further response to interrogatories involves demonstrating that an answer is evasive or incomplete, an exercise of the option to produce documents is unwarranted or the specification of those documents is inadequate, or an objection is without merit or too general. The responding party has the burden of justifying objections. The propounding party must submit a declaration under Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040, stating facts demonstrating a good faith and reasonable effort to informally resolve each issue raised by the motion.

Plaintiff moved to compel Defendants’ further responses to Requests for Production. However, Defendant argued that Plaintiff’s Motion was not timely, as the initial responses were provided on or about December 6, 2022, and Plaintiff had 45 days to pursue a motion to compel. Plaintiff argued that Defendant’s counsel agreed in writing to extend the deadline for all of Plaintiff’s motions to compel. The Court previously concluded that the agreement applied only to Request Nos. 3, 4, and 6, and not to Nos. 5, 7, and 10.

Defendant seeks sanctions against Plaintiff, but did not request sanctions in their notice of opposition, so the Court cannot grant this request. Plaintiff requested certification of appeal pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 166.1, but this was made for the first time in the reply, and Defendants have not had an opportunity to respond.

The motion is denied as untimely, and the moving party is required to give notice.
