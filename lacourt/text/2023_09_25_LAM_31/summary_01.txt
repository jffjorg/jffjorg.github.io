And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production because it is untimely. The plaintiff had agreed to extend the deadline for moving to compel further responses, but only for certain requests. The plaintiff's motion to compel further responses covers additional requests that were not included in the previous agreement. The judge has also denied the defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiff.

The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for certification of appeal, as it was made for the first time in the reply and the defendant has not had an opportunity to respond. The judge notes that the parties had agreed to extend the deadline for moving to compel further responses, but only for certain requests, and that the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses covers additional requests that were not included in the previous agreement.

Overall, the judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses because it is untimely, and has also denied the defendant's request for sanctions and the plaintiff's request for certification of appeal.
