Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a demurrer filed by the Defendant, Coast National Insurance Company, and a request for judicial notice filed by the Plaintiff. The Defendant demurred, arguing that a prior default judgment obtained by the Plaintiff in a separate action, the Rescission Action, precludes the Plaintiff from relitigating the issues in this case. The Judge has granted the Defendant's request for judicial notice of certain documents related to the Rescission Action, but has denied the Plaintiff's request for judicial notice of other documents. The Judge has also overruled the Defendant's demurrer, finding that the Defendant has not met its burden of proving that the requirements of the doctrine of res judicata are satisfied. The Judge notes that the Defendant has not briefed whether the issues raised by the complaint in this matter were the same issues litigated in the default matter, and that the default judgment is only conclusive as to matters that were properly pleaded in the complaint. The Judge requires the Defendant to meet its burden of proof if it wishes to raise the issue of res judicata again.
