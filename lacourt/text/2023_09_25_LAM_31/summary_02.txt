Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a demurrer filed by the Defendant, Coast National Insurance Company, and a request for judicial notice filed by the Plaintiff. The Defendant demurred, arguing that a prior default judgment obtained by the Plaintiff in a separate action, the Rescission Action, precludes the Plaintiff from relitigating the issues in this case. The Judge has granted the Defendant's request for judicial notice of certain documents related to the Rescission Action, but has denied the Plaintiff's request for judicial notice of other documents. The Judge has also overruled the Defendant's demurrer, finding that the Defendant has not met its burden of proving that the requirements of the doctrine of res judicata are satisfied. The Judge notes that the Defendant has not briefed whether the issues raised by the complaint in this matter were the same issues litigated in the default matter, and that the default judgment is only conclusive as to matters that were properly pleaded in the complaint. The Judge requires the Defendant to meet its burden of proof if it wishes to raise the issue of res judicata again.

**English Text Summary:**

The judge has denied the defendant's request to dismiss the case. The defendant argued that a previous lawsuit where a default judgment was entered against the plaintiff in a different case should prevent this lawsuit from proceeding. The judge found that the defendant did not provide enough evidence to show that the current case is barred by the previous judgment. The judge is allowing the case to proceed and is giving the defendant another chance to make their argument if they can provide more evidence.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by Coast National Insurance Company, which argues that a prior default judgment obtained in a separate case (Recission Action) against Yoko Saito requires the court to sustain the demurrer without leave to amend, based on the doctrine of res judicata. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that Coast National Insurance Company has not met its burden of proving that the requirements of the doctrine are satisfied. The judge notes that the default judgment is only conclusive as to matters that were properly pleaded in the complaint, and that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply to defenses that were not raised in the prior case. The judge has also granted the requests for judicial notice filed by both parties, with some exceptions.
