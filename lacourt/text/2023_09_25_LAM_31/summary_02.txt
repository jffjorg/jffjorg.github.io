Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a demurrer filed by the Defendant, Coast National Insurance Company, and a request for judicial notice filed by the Plaintiff. The Defendant demurred, arguing that a prior default judgment obtained by the Plaintiff in a separate action, the Rescission Action, precludes the Plaintiff from relitigating the issues in this case. The Judge has granted the Defendant's request for judicial notice of certain documents related to the Rescission Action, but has denied the Plaintiff's request for judicial notice of other documents. The Judge has also overruled the Defendant's demurrer, finding that the Defendant has not met its burden of proving that the requirements of the doctrine of res judicata are satisfied. The Judge notes that the Defendant has not briefed whether the issues raised by the complaint in this matter were the same issues litigated in the default matter, and that the default judgment is only conclusive as to matters that were properly pleaded in the complaint. The Judge requires the Defendant to meet its burden of proof if it wishes to raise the issue of res judicata again.

**English Text Summary:**

The judge is allowing the case to proceed and is giving the defendant another chance to make their argument if they can provide more evidence.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by Coast National Insurance Company, which argues that a prior default judgment obtained in a separate case (Recission Action) against Yoko Saito requires the court to sustain the demurrer without leave to amend, based on the doctrine of res judicata. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that Coast National Insurance Company has not met its burden of proving that the requirements of the doctrine are satisfied. The judge notes that the default judgment is only conclusive as to matters that were properly pleaded in the complaint, and that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply to defenses that were not raised in the prior case. The judge has also granted the requests for judicial notice filed by both parties, with some exceptions.

## Case Summary: 23STCV06402

**Case Number:** 23STCV06402
**Hearing Date:** September 25, 2023
**Department:** 31

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:**  [Name not provided in document]
* **Defendant:** Coast National Insurance Company

**Significant Statements:**

* **Judge's Ruling:** Defendant's demurrer is **OVERRULED**.
* **Res Judicata Argument:** Defendant argued that a prior default judgment in a case against Yoko Saito (Case No. 18STCV01690) bars this action based on res judicata.
* **Judge's Reasoning:** The Court finds Defendant has not met its burden of proving that res judicata applies. While a default judgment can be conclusive, it only applies to matters *properly pleaded* in the original complaint. Defendant did not address whether the issues raised in the current complaint were actually litigated in the prior case, or whether Plaintiff's defenses were raised and decided.

**Key Facts:**

* A default judgment was entered against Yoko Saito in Case No. 18STCV01690, filed by Coast National Insurance Company.
* The current complaint alleges additional causes of action not present in the prior case.
* Defendant did not adequately argue how the prior judgment bars the current claims.

**Legal Issues:**

* Res judicata (claim preclusion) 
* Collateral estoppel (issue preclusion)
* Sufficiency of a complaint

* _Hahn v. Mirda_ (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740

 **English Summary:**

The judge has decided to not dismiss the case (overrule the demurrer).  

The insurance company argued that a previous court case against Yoko Saito should prevent this case from going forward. This is because a default judgment was granted against Saito in that earlier case. 

However, the judge found that the insurance company didn't properly explain why the earlier case prevents this case from being heard. The judge noted that the current case involves different legal claims than the previous case.

**Tentative Ruling:** Defendant Coast National Insurance Company’s demurrer is OVERRULED.

**People-Names:** Limor Lehavi, Yoko Saito, Amy Valley, Latoya M. AIlen

**Company-Names:** Coast National Insurance Company

**Places:** Los Angeles Superior Court

**Dates:** October 18, 2018; April 17, 2019; April 26, 2019

**Events:** Filing of the Rescission Action (18STCV01690) against Yoko Saito by Coast National Insurance Company, granting of default judgment in favor of Coast National and against Yoko Saito in the Rescission Action.

**Acts:** Defendant Coast National Insurance Company's demurrer, Plaintiff's and Defendant's requests for judicial notice.

**Roles:** Plaintiff, Defendant

**Significant Statements:** The court treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action. A default judgment is only conclusive as to matters that were properly pleaded in the complaint and not conclusive as to matters that occurred after the complaint was filed and not covered in the complaint.

In this case, the court overrules Defendant's demurrer as Defendant has not met its burden of proving that the requirements of res judicata are satisfied. If Defendant wishes to raise the issue of res judicata again, it should be prepared to meet its burden to prove each element including showing that each of Plaintiff’s defenses were actually litigated in the default matter.
