```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to amend the judgment due to a typographical error. The error occurred when the court entered an amended judgment on June 13, 2024, naming only Elias Castro and Enrique Lopez as defendants, while omitting E L Engineering Corp. The court finds that the error was clerical and that the court may correct it under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 473. The amended judgment will name all three defendants, E L Engineering Corp, Elias Castro, and Enrique Lopez, as judgment debtors.
