Background    
Plaintiff Julio Garcia (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
Plaintiff worked for Second Street
Promenade, LLC dba Metro Event Center (erroneously
sued as “Metro Event Center”) (“Metro”) from 2016 through August 12, 2019. On
or about June 2019, Plaintiff informed his manager he was not feeling well and
that his arm was bothering him due to nerve damage in his right arm. Plaintiff
noticed that his hours were being cut shortly thereafter. Defendant never
informed Plaintiff why his hours were being cut. After weeks of gradually
reducing Plaintiff’s hours, Defendant then took him off the schedule
completely. Plaintiff was never called back to work by Defendant.
On February 3, 2022,

Street Promenade, LLC will be a Single Entity Known as Second Street Promenade,
LLC dba Metro Event Center” was entered.
The Final Status
Conference is set for August 27, 2024. Trial is set for September 10, 2024.
Discussion
Cummins & White, LLP (“Firm”) seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for Metro (“Client”).
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See
Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.)
California
Rules of Court (“CRC”) Rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice of motion and motion
directed to the client (made on the Notice
of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure § 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under section
284(1) (made on the Declaration in
Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form
(MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and
the proposed order on the client and on all other parties who have appeared in
the case; and (4) a proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). The court may
delay the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service
of a copy of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
Attorney Erick J. Becker (“Becker”) attests that the Client “refuses to
follow counsel’s advice that necessary trial preparation and discovery be conducted
and will not agree to pay for any work to be performed in preparation for
trial,” which has caused an “irreconcilable breakdown of the attorney-client
relationship.”
Becker states that he has served the Client by mail at the Client’s last
known address with copies of the motion papers served with his declaration and
that he has confirmed, within the past 30 days, that the address is current, via
email and mail. Becker explains that the Client corresponded with counsel from
the same email address the Client was served with the instant motion and also
paid invoices that were sent to this email address within the last 30 days. He
advises that the Client was also served with the instant motion via mail, which
was confirmed as current via a review of their business website within the last
30 days. 
The motion is not
opposed. The court determines that the requirements of Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 enumerated
above have been sufficiently met.
Accordingly, the
motion is granted, effective upon the filing of a proof
of service showing service of the signed order upon
the Client at the Client’s last known address.
The court will set an
Order to Show Cause Re: Representation of LLC for October 1, 2024
at 8:30 a.m.
