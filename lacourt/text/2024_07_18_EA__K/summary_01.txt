And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Cummins & White, LLP's motion to be relieved as counsel of record for Second Street Promenade, LLC dba Metro Event Center, effective upon the filing of a proof of service showing service of the signed order upon the Client at the Client's last known address. The motion is granted based on the attorney's declaration stating that the Client refuses to follow counsel's advice and will not agree to pay for any work to be performed in preparation for trial, which has caused an "irreconcilable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship." The court will set an Order to Show Cause Re: Representation of LLC for October 1, 2024 at 8:30 a.m.
