 Case Number:  23PSCV03472    Hearing Date:   July 18, 2024    Dept:  K Defendant Jesus
Camacho’s Demurrer to Plaintiff Brandy Camacho’s First Amended Complaint for
Damages is OVERRULED.
Background    
Plaintiff Brandy Camacho
(“Plaintiff”) alleges that her father, Jesus Camacho (“Defendant”), neglected
and abused her while she was a minor.
On April 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”), asserting a cause of action against Defendant and
Does 1-10 for:
1.              
Negligent Child Abuse
A Case Management Conference is set
for July 18, 2024.
Legal Standard
A
demurrer may be made on the grounds that the pleading, inter alia, does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and/or is uncertain.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subds. (e) and (f).)
When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of
the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A
demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the
pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 [citations omitted].) At the pleading stage, a
plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant
of the factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) “[A] demurrer
does not, however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law
alleged in the pleading, or the construction placed on an instrument pleaded
therein, or facts impossible in law, or allegations contrary to facts of which
a court may take judicial knowledge.” (S.
Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 [citations
omitted].)
Discussion
Defendant demurs to Plaintiff’s FAC, pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure § 430.10, subdivisions (e) and (f), on the basis that it fails
to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain.
Defendant cites to Gibson v. Gibson (1971) 3 Cal.3d 914; however, the California Supreme Court abolished
the doctrine of parental immunity in that case. Defendant fails to cite to any
legal authority for his statement that “negligence or neglect are not valid
causes of action against a parent by a child.” (Motion, 7:15-17).
“The elements of any
negligence cause of action are duty, breach of duty, proximate cause, and
damages.” (Peredia v. HR Mobile Services,
Inc. (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 680, 687.) Defendant asserts, without more, that
Plaintiff has failed to plead the elements of duty and breach. The court
disagrees. (See FAC, ¶¶ 6-18, 20, 21 and 23-25).
Defendant’s demurrer is
overruled.
