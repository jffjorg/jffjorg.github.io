 Case Number:  22PSCV01241    Hearing Date:   July 18, 2024    Dept:  K Plaintiff American Contractors Indemnity Company’s Motion
to Amend Judgment Due to Typographical Error is GRANTED.
 
Background    
 
Plaintiff
American Contractors Indemnity Company (“ACIC”) alleges as follows: ACIC is a
surety company. On or about December 11, 2014, E L Engineering Corp aka E L
Plumbing & Rooter aka E L Plumbing aka E.L. Engineering Plumbing and Rooter
aka E L Plumbing—Rooter (“E L Engineering”), Enrique Lopez aka Enrique A. Lopez
(“Lopez”), Maria Rodriguez aka Maria C. Rodriguez aka Marie Rodriguez aka Maria
Del Carmen aka Maria Del Carmen Rodriguez (“Rodriguez”) and Elias Castro aka
Elias D. Castro (“Castro”) (collectively, “Indemnitors”) executed a general
indemnity agreement (the “GIA”) in favor of ACIC. ACIC then issued Public Works
Payment and Performance Surety Bond No. 1001096845 in the amount of $191,510.00
(the “Bond”), which named E L engineering as principal and the Ontario
International Airport Administration Offices as obligee. Claims were made on
the Bond which ACIC paid out on in an amount totaling $84,463.55. ACIC also
incurred attorneys’ and consultants’ fees, costs and expenses as a consequence
of its issuance of the Bond. ACIC has demanded reimbursement from the
Indemnitors, but have only received payments totaling $12,600.00.
 
On October 12, 2022,
ACIC filed a complaint, asserting causes of action against Indemnitors and Does
1-50 for:
 
1.                 
Breach of Contract
2.                 
Statutory Indemnity
3.                 
Declaratory Relief
 
On December 13, 2022, E
L Enginering’s and Lopez’s defaults were entered.
 
On September 11, 2023, Rodriguez filed a “Notice of Stay of
Proceedings,” advising therein of her Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing.
 
On November 20, 2023, ACIC dismissed Rodriguez, without
prejudice.
 
On April 29, 2024, “Judgment Pursuant to Stipulation in
Favor of Plaintiff American Contractors Indemnity Company and Against Defendant
Elias Castro” was entered.
 
On June 13, 2024, an “Amended Judgment Pursuant to
Stipulation and Default Proceedings” was entered.
 
Legal Standard 
 
“The court may . . . allow a party to amend any pleading or
proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a
mistake in the name of a party . . .” (Code Civ. Pro., § 473, subd. (a)(1).)
 
“The court may, upon motion of the injured party, or its own
motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered, so as
to conform to the judgment or order directed . . .” (Code Civ. Pro., § 473,
subd. (d).)
 
Discussion 
 
ACIC moves the court
for an order to amend the judgment entered on June 13, 2024 due to a typographical
error.
 
ACIC’s counsel Amber
N. Kim (“Kim”) represents as follows: 
 
Rodriguez was
dismissed on November 20, 2023. (Kim Decl., ¶ 5). On April 29, 2024, ACIC and
Castro executed and entered into a “Stipulation for Entry of Judgment” and
subsequently a “Judgment Pursuant to Stipulation” was filed and entered the
same day. (Id., ¶ 6). On May 29, 2024, ACIC submitted its request for
entry of default judgment against E L Engineering and Lopez and at the June 6,
2024 hearing, the court issued an order granting default judgment in favor of
ACIC and against said defendants. (Id., ¶ 7, Exhs. 1 and 2). On the
proposed amended judgment submitted by ACIC to the court on June 10, 2024, only
Castro and Lopez were named in the judgment and E L Engineering was
inadvertently omitted. (Id., ¶ 8). On June 13, 2024, in reliance on the
wording of the proposed amended judgment as drafted by ACIC, the court entered
judgment against Castro and Lopez only. (Id., ¶ 8, Exh. 3.) 
 
The motion is
granted.
