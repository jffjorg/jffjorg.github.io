And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) is overruled. The plaintiff, Brandy Camacho, alleges that her father, Jesus Camacho, neglected and abused her while she was a minor. The defendant demurred to the FAC on the grounds that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. The court disagrees with the defendant's arguments and finds that the FAC states sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. The court cites various legal authorities, including Gibson v. Gibson and Peredia v. HR Mobile Services, Inc., to support its ruling. The case is set for a Case Management Conference on July 18, 2024.
