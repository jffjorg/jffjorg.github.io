TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:  
 
DEMURRER TO
  PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT; 
 
MOTION TO STRIKE
  PORTIONS OF PLAINTIFF’S  COMPLAINT
 



 
Background
            Plaintiff The Estate of Lucy M. Johnson
by Eric Walker, its Special Administrator (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action on May 17, 2023 against a number of Defendants, including Defendant
Priority Title Company (“PTC”). The Complaint alleges causes of action for (1)
quiet title, (2) cancellation of recorded instruments, and (3) fraud and
negligence. 
            PTC now demurs to the Complaint. PTC
also moves to strike portions of the Complaint. Plaintiff opposes both. 
Discussion
As an initial matter, the Court notes that PTC’s counsel’s
declaration filed in support of the demurrer and motion to strike indicates, inter
alia, that “[o]n June
6, 2023, I sent via email a detailed four (4) page meet and confer letter to Plaintiffs’ counsel in an
attempt to resolve this matter without court intervention.” (Anaya Decl., ¶ 2.) PTC’s counsel further states that “[o]n June 20, 2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel
responded to my June 6, 2023 letter with a three page letter. Said letter from Plaintiff’s
counsel revealed that both parties disagree on the facts and law herein thereby
necessitating the present demurrer and motion to strike.” (Anaya Decl.,
¶ 3.) 
The Court notes that PTC’s counsel’s declaration does not
demonstrate that the parties met and conferred by telephone or in person in
advance of PTC filing the instant demurrer and motion to strike. 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41,
subdivision (a), “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring
party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the
party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of
determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Emphasis added.) 
In addition, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5,
subdivision (a), “[b]efore filing a motion to strike…the moving party shall meet
and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the
pleading that is subject to the motion to strike for the purpose of determining
if an agreement can be reached that resolves the objections to be raised in the
motion to strike.” (Emphasis added.)
 Such meeting and conferring
must be done in good faith with an effort to try to resolve the issues subject
to the demurrer and motion to strike.  
In light
of the foregoing, the hearing on PTC’s demurrer and motion to strike is
continued to Nov. 7, 2023, 2023 at 2:00 p.m.
in Dept. 50.¿
PTC is¿ordered
to meet¿and confer¿with Plaintiff within 10 days of the date of this order.¿If
the parties are unable to resolve the pleading issues¿or if the parties are
otherwise unable to meet and confer in good faith, PTC is to¿thereafter¿file
and serve¿a declaration setting forth the efforts to meet and confer in
compliance with¿Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a)(3) and Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5, subdivision (a)(3) within 15 days of this order.¿ 
///
PTC is ordered to give notice of this order.¿
