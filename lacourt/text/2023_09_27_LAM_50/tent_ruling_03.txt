TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:
 
MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL 
 



Richard A. Kolber of the Law Offices of Richard A. Kolber (“Counsel”) moves to be
relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Kenneth
Wengrod, Trustee of the Manhattan Trust. 
While Counsel has provided
sufficient reason for withdrawal, Counsel’s notice of motion and motion (Form
MC-051) indicates that Counsel’s client is “Kenneth Wengrod, Trustee of the
Manhattan Trust, derivatively, on behalf of Lily
Bleu, Inc.” However, the
proposed order (Form MC-053) indicates that Counsel moves to be relieved as
counsel for “Kenneth Wengrod, Trustee of the Manhattan Trust.”  
The Court also notes that on August 30, 2023, the same day the instant
motion to be relieved as counsel was filed, Defendants Michael Weiss,
Barbara Cambilargiu, Good Day Gardena LLC, Carl Cambilargiu, Miriam Weiss,
Jenna Cambilargiu, and Jessica Weiss Sonnabend filed a demurrer and motion to
strike, which are scheduled for hearing on December 6, 2023 at 2:00 p.m. The
December 6, 2023 hearing is not referenced in the instant motion. 
The matter is denied without prejudice to Counsel correcting
the above.
