And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Hon. Rolf Treu, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Richard A. Kolber, counsel for Plaintiff Kenneth Wengrod, Trustee of the Manhattan Trust. The motion is denied without prejudice to Counsel correcting the above. The issue arises from inconsistencies between Counsel's notice of motion and motion, which state that Counsel's client is "Kenneth Wengrod, Trustee of the Manhattan Trust, derivatively, on behalf of Lily Bleu, Inc.", and the proposed order, which only mentions "Kenneth Wengrod, Trustee of the Manhattan Trust". The Court notes that this inconsistency may impact the Court's ability to rule on the motion.
