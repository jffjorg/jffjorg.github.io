**English Summary:**

This tentative ruling addresses a case called *The Estate of Lucy M. Johnson v. Priority Title Company*. The Defendant, Priority Title Company (PTC), filed a demurrer (a formal objection) to the Plaintiff’s complaint and a motion to strike portions of the complaint. 

The Judge notes that PTC's attorney attempted to meet and confer with the Plaintiff's attorney via email to attempt to resolve the issues before filing the demurrer and motion to strike. However, the Judge found that PTC’s counsel did not demonstrate that the parties met and conferred by phone or in person, as required by California law.

Therefore, the Judge continued the hearing to November 7, 2023, and ordered PTC to meet and confer with the Plaintiff in good faith within 10 days. PTC must also file a declaration explaining their meet and confer efforts if they are unable to reach an agreement.
