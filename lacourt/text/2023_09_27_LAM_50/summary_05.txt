And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on Priority Title Company's (PTC) demurrer and motion to strike to November 7, 2023. Before the hearing, PTC is ordered to meet and confer with the plaintiff in good faith to try to resolve the pleading issues. If the parties are unable to meet and confer or if they are unable to resolve the issues, PTC must file and serve a declaration setting forth the efforts to meet and confer. The judge notes that PTC's counsel's declaration does not demonstrate that the parties met and conferred by telephone or in person before filing the demurrer and motion to strike, and that meeting and conferencing must be done in good faith with an effort to try to resolve the issues.
