TENTATIVE RULING RE:  
MOTION TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
Michael Juarez-Munoz,
Esq. of Downtown Los Angeles Law Group (“Counsel”) moves to be relieved
as counsel for Plaintiff Thadduas
Sistrunk. 
The Court
notes that while Counsel has provided sufficient reason for withdrawal, no proof of
service was filed with the motion. Pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, subdivision (d), “[t]he notice of motion and motion, the
declaration, and the proposed order must be served on the client and on all
other parties who have appeared in the case. The notice may be by personal
service, electronic service, or mail.” 
In
addition, Items 3(b)(1) and 3(b)(2) of the Declaration (Form MC-052) are both
checked. Thus, it is unclear whether Counsel has or has not confirmed that
Counsel’s client’s address is current.

///
Based on the foregoing,
the Court denies the motion without prejudice. Counsel is ordered to give
notice of this order.
