As a result, the judge denied the motion without prejudice, meaning the attorney can refile the motion after addressing these issues.

---

The tentative ruling states that Michael Juarez-Munoz, counsel for plaintiff Thadduas Sistrunk, has filed a motion to be relieved as counsel. However, the motion is denied without prejudice because no proof of service was filed with the motion, and it is unclear whether Counsel has confirmed that Counsel’s client’s address is current. Counsel is ordered to give notice of this order.
