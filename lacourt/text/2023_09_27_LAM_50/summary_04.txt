And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of Michael Juarez-Munoz, Esq., counsel for plaintiff Thadduas Sistrunk, to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The motion was not served properly, as required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, subdivision (d), which states that notice of the motion must be served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case. The judge notes that while Counsel has provided sufficient reason for withdrawal, the lack of proof of service is a procedural issue that must be resolved before the motion can be considered. The judge orders Counsel to give notice of this order.
