Summary in English text:

The Judge, Rolf M. Treu, issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiffs' Motion for Sanctions against the Defendant, MCDONALD'S USA, LLC. The Plaintiffs, WEATHER GROUP, LLC and Entertainment Studios Networks, Inc., filed a complaint alleging fraud and false promise against the Defendant, claiming that it failed to spend its advertising budget on Black Owned Media as promised. The Defendant filed a motion for sanctions, arguing that the Plaintiffs' claims were frivolous and filed in bad faith. The Judge disagreed, finding that the Defendant's motion for sanctions was not filed in bad faith and that the Plaintiffs failed to show a prima facie case of fraud. The Judge also noted that the Defendant's failure to spend its advertising budget on Black Owned Media was not a surprise, given the lack of discovery and opportunity for the Plaintiffs to prove their claims.
