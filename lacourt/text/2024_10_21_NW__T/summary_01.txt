And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's amended motion for sanctions. The defendant failed to comply with the statutory requirements for the 128.7 motion, which requires a separate motion to be filed, and the 21-day "safe harbor" rule, which prohibits the imposition of sanctions before the expiration of the 21-day period. The defendant also failed to provide proper notice and service for the 128.7 motion. The court finds that the defendant's motion is unpersuasive and there are further grounds to deny the motion. The judge also notes that the court does not rule on the objections to declarations as the issues are moot due to the procedural failures.
