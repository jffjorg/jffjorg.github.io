  Case Number:  23VECV02672    Hearing Date:   October 21, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV02672  MICHEL V
RUSKIN
[TENTATIVE] ORDER: 
Defendant Aaron Ruskin’s Amended Motion for Sanctions is DENIED.  Counsel
for moving party is admonished for failure to comply with the specific
statutory, procedural requirements for these motions. The court does not rule on
the objections to declarations as the issues are moot due to the procedural
failures.
Introduction
Within a single amended motion,
Defendant Aaron Ruskin (Defendant) moved for monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff Raquel Michel (Plaintiff) and Plaintiff’s Counsel Michael Mason
(Counsel) pursuant Code of Civil Procedure, section 128.5 (128.5 Motion) and
section 128.7 (128.7 Motion). 
Discussion
A 128.7 Motion is required to be
made separate from any other motion or request to the Court.  (Code Civ.
Proc., sec. 128.7(c)(1); Martorana v. Marlin & Saltzman (2009) 175
Cal.App.4th 685, 699.)  Defendant joined the 128.7 Motion and the 128.5
Motion into a single motion.  Because the 128.7 Motion was not made
separately, Defendant failed to comply with the statutory requirements. 
On this defect, there is grounds to deny the portion of the motion seeking
relief under Code of Civil Procedure, section 128.7. 
Further, as to the 128.7 Motion,
the 21-day “safe harbor” provision is strictly enforced.  “Substantial
compliance” is insufficient.  (Cromwell v. Cummings (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th
Supp. 10, 15.)  The 21-day safe harbor rule prohibits the imposition of
sanctions before the expiration of the 21-day safe harbor period. 
(Goodstone v. Southwest Airlines Co. (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 406, 418-419.) 
The 128.7 Motion cannot be filed until 21 days, or any other period as the
court may prescribe, after it is served.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec.
128.7(c)(1); Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Structured Asset Sales, LLC (2022) 75
Cal.App.5th 596, 605; Transcon Financial, Inc. v. Reid & Hellyer, APC
(2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 547, 550-551.)  The notice for the 128.7 Motion that
is served must comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure, section
1010, requiring identification of when the motion is to be heard.  Without
identification of the time and date on the notice, service of the 128.7 Motion
does not satisfy the “safe harbor” requirement even if a second notice stating
the time and place is served when the motion is filed.  (Galleria Plus,
Inc. v. Hanmi Bank (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 535, 538.)  Informal notice of
an intent to seek sanctions cannot serve as a substitute for a formal motion.
Service of the formal motion must be served to commence the 21-day safe harbor
period. (Martorana v. Marlin & Saltzman (2009) 175 CA4th 685, 699.)
Attorney Nicole Rosenberg’s
(Rosenberg) amended declaration attests to sending a “safe harbor letter to
Mason threatening motion for sanctions” on February 21, 2024.  (Rosenberg
Amended Decl. par. 6.)  As stated above, a letter threatening to file a
sanctions motion is insufficient and not in compliance with the 21-day safe
harbor rule.  Rosenberg’s February 21, 2024, letter is insufficient to
comply with the 21-day safe harbor rule.
Rosenberg continued to attest
that she sent a “second Safe Harbor Letter attaching proposed Motion for
128.5/7 sanctions” on July 9, 2024.  (Id.)  Attesting to sending the
“proposed Motion” as an attachment to a letter is insufficient to show service
of the noticed motion.  Defendant further purported to attach a copy of
the letter, but it did not include a copy of the “proposed Motion”. 
(Rosenberg Amended Decl., Exh. B.)  Even if attaching the “proposed
Motion” to the letter could be considered service, Defendant did not submit a
proof of service showing proper service of the motion on July 9, 2024. 
Further, without submitting a copy of the “proposed Motion,” it is not
sufficiently shown that the Notice attached to the “proposed Motion” included
the time and date of the instant hearing.  The Court further noted that
the Court Reservation System’s “Reservation History” showed that Defendant
reserved the instant hearing date on August 9, 2024, at 4:33 P.M.  Because
Defendant reserved the instant hearing date after the alleged July 9, 2024,
mailing of the “proposed Motion,” it is inferred that the July 9, 2024, mailing
of the “proposed Motion” did not include identification of the instant hearing
date.  Because Defendant failed to show proper service and failed to show
proper notice of the instant hearing date, Defendant failed to comply with the
21-day safe harbor period.  Because Defendant failed to comply with the
21-day safe harbor period, the motion is unpersuasive and there are further
grounds to deny the 128.7 Motion.
As to the 128.5 Motion, the
moving party must follow the 21-day safe harbor procedure found in Code of
Civil Procedure, section 128.7, when sanctions are sought based upon an
offending document that can be “appropriately corrected” by withdrawing or correcting
them.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 128.5(f)(1)(B); Transcon Financial, Inc. v.
Reid & Hellyer, APC (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 547, 550; Zarate v. McDaniel
(2023) 97 Cal.App.5th 484, 490-49.)  The 128.5 Motion is grounded upon a
request for Plaintiff to withdraw the First Amended Complaint (FAC) against
Defendant.  Defendant’s Notice to the instant motion states that Plaintiff
violated the statutes by: 
“repeatedly by filing a complaint
containing frivolous allegations and factual contentions about Ruskin; filing
an amended complaint with the same frivolous allegations and factual
contentions about Ruskin despite being presented with evidence demonstrating
that Ruskin was a bona fide purchaser for value of the vehicle at issue in the
case which is a complete and total affirmative defense to the claims against
him; and for continuing to prosecute the case against Ruskin based on frivolous
allegations and factual contentions despite the evidence of Ruskin’s
affirmative defense and the frivolity of Michel’s contentions.”
(Notice to the Motion, pg.
2:8-14.) 
Defendant’s requested relief
indicates that the offending document can be corrected by either withdrawing
the FAC or withdrawing the allegedly frivolous allegations and factual
contentions in the FAC.  Because the FAC can be corrected or withdrawn, Defendant’s
128.5 Motion was required to comply with the 21-day safe harbor rule.  As
reviewed above, Defendant failed to comply with the rule and the 128.5 Motion
is also unpersuasive.
The Motion for Sanctions is
DENIED. 
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE
NOTICE.
