And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendants (U-Haul Co. of California, U-Haul Co. of Arizona, and Arcoa Risk Retention Group, Inc.) to the Cross-Complaint filed by Cross-Complainant (Volodia Manoukian) is OVERRULED. The Judge also declined to consider the Cross-Defendants' motion to strike portions of the Cross-Complaint because the opposition to the motion was not properly filed with the Court.

The Judge's ruling is based on the allegations made in the Cross-Complaint, which deny any involvement in crime/fraud or schemes to defraud Cross-Defendants. The Judge found that the Cross-Defendants' arguments based on the crime/fraud provision of the rental contract were unpersuasive and improper for a demurrer. The Judge also found that the Cross-Defendants' arguments about punitive damages and fraud were unpersuasive and improper for a demurrer.

The Judge noted that the Cross-Defendants' demurrer was frivolous and a waste of the Court's time, and will discuss this further at the hearing. The Judge also referred to facts outside of the Cross-Complaint to dispute the validity of the allegations, which is not allowed on demurrer.

Overall, the Judge's tentative ruling is a significant victory for Cross-Complainant, as it allows the case to proceed and allows Cross-Complainant to further develop its claims against Cross-Defendants.
