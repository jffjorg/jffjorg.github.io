And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motions to compel further responses to his Special Interrogatories (Set One) and Requests for Production (RFPs) (Set One). The defendant, Sunset Athletic Club, LLC, has been sanctioned $3,010, payable within 60 days, jointly and severally with its counsel. The plaintiff filed suit against the defendant alleging untimely payment of final wages, failure to provide accurate itemized wage statements, breach of written contract, intentional misrepresentation, and negligent misrepresentation. The plaintiff's motions were necessary because the defendant failed to provide adequate responses to the Special Interrogatories and RFPs, and the defendant's claims that it would provide additional responses were not persuasive.
