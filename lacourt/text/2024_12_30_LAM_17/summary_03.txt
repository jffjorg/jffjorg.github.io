And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer is sustained, meaning the plaintiff's complaint is unclear and lacks sufficient facts to support a cause of action. The plaintiff, Karen Denise Works, filed a complaint against the defendant, Kimani Thomas, a social worker at DCFS, alleging various events and claims. However, the complaint does not set forth a cause of action and the allegations are unclear. The judge has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend their complaint to set forth cognizable claims that are not barred by various Government Code provisions. The defendant's demurrer is sustained, and the case is placed on hold pending the plaintiff's amendment.
