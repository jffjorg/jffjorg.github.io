The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to continue the trial. The defendant, MV Transportation, Inc., had requested a seven-month continuance to August 2024 due to the plaintiff, Jeanett Gertrudiz, being involved in a second car accident and sustaining personal injury. However, the judge found that the defendant did not provide sufficient evidence and good cause for the continuance. The judge noted that the defendant did not provide a clear statement regarding when they or their counsel first learned of the accident, and that the moving party bears the burden of presenting evidence in support of its request for relief. The motion is denied, and the defendant is ordered to give notice.
