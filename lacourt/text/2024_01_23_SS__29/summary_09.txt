And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant on October 26, 2022, alleging five causes of action, but has not filed a proof of service to demonstrate that the defendant was properly served. The defendant contends that he was not served with the summons and complaint, and that substituted service was attempted but failed. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to establish proper service, and therefore lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendant. As a result, the motion to quash service of summons is granted.
