And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motions to compel the plaintiffs to respond to discovery requests and to deem certain matters admitted without prejudice. The motions were filed by the defendant against the two plaintiffs, who are representing themselves after their previous counsel was relieved. The defendant had served the plaintiffs with discovery requests, including special interrogatories, form interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission. However, the plaintiffs did not respond to the requests, and the defendant filed the motions to compel a response. The judge found that there was no adequate proof of service of the motions on the plaintiffs, as they are not represented parties and did not consent to electronic service of court documents. Therefore, the motions were denied without prejudice. The judge expressed no views on the merits of the motions.
