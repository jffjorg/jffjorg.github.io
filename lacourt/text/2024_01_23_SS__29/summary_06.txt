And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to dismiss a personal injury and medical malpractice case. The case was filed on June 2, 2021, and the defendant, Shahab Ebrahimian, D.D.S., has filed a motion to dismiss due to the plaintiff's failure to prosecute. The defendant argues that the plaintiff has not appeared for deposition, has not responded to discovery requests, and has not cooperated in the discovery process. The judge finds that the defendant has shown due diligence in pursuing discovery and has not delayed the case. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's failure to prosecute has made it difficult for the defendant to evaluate the case and settle the matter. Based on these factors, the judge has continued the hearing on the motion to January 24, 2024, and has ordered the defendant to give notice. If the plaintiff fails to appear at the trial, the case will be subject to dismissal.
