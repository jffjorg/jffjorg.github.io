 Case Number:  20STCV14201    Hearing Date:   January 23, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Set Aside Dismissal filed by Plaintiffs Jennifer
Terlaje and Timothy Terlaje.
 
Tentative
The motion is GRANTED.
Background
On April 13, 2020, Plaintiffs Jennifer
Terlaje and Timothy Terlaje (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed their complaint
against Rosario Guillen, Vicky Cortes, Guillen Family Child Care, and Does 1
through 100 for damages arising from the death of Maxwell Terlaje on April 26,
2018, who was under Defendants’ care at the time.
In May and June 2022, the Clerk entered the
defaults of the named defendants.  On July
26, 2022, the Court set an OSC e dismissal for failure to enter default
judgment for November 21, 2022.  The
hearing was continued to February 3, 2023; April 10, 2023; and August 9,
2023.  When there was no appearance on August
9, 2023, the Court dismissed the complaint without prejudice.
On October 19, 2023, Plaintiffs filed this
motion to set aside the dismissal.
No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
“The court may, upon any terms as may be
just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this
relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed
to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall
be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken…” (Code Civ. Pro., §473, subd. (b).) 
To qualify for relief under section 473,
the moving party must act diligently in seeking relief and must submit
affidavits or testimony demonstrating a reasonable cause for the
default. (Elston v. City of Turlock (1985) 38 Cal.3d 227, 234.) 
“In a motion under section 473 the initial
burden is on the moving party to prove excusable neglect by a “preponderance of
the evidence. [Citations]”” (Kendall v. Barker (1988) 197 Cal.App.3d
619, 624.) “The moving party has a double burden: He must show a satisfactory
excuse for his default, and he must show diligence in making the motion after
discovery of the default.” (Id. at 625.)
Discussion
Plaintiff’s
counsel states in his declaration that his failure to appear at the OSC hearing
on August 9, 2023, and the resulting dismissal, was the result of a calendaring
error and is this “solely attributable to the mistake, inadvertence, surprise
or excusable neglect of plaintiff’s counsel.” (King Decl., ¶ 14.) 
 
No opposition
has been filed.
 
The Court finds
Plaintiffs have established the dismissal occurred due to counsel’s mistake and
inadvertence.  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS
the motion to set aside the dismissal under Code of
Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). 
 
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion to set aside the dismissal.
The Order of Dismissal filed on August 9, 2023, is hereby SET
ASIDE.
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision
(c)(1)(B), the Court ORDERS counsel of record Justin H. King to pay $250 to the
State Bar Client Security Fund, and to file proof of payment with the Court by
no later than February 29, 2024.
The Court sets an Order to Show Cause as to why this action should
not be dismissed for failure to have default judgment entered for March __,
2024, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 29 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
