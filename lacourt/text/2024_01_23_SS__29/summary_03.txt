And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for leave to file a cross-complaint by defendants Har-South Marengo Manager, LLC and Har-South Marengo Avenue, LLC against Jones Lang Lasalle Americas, Inc. (JLL) for indemnity, apportionment of fault, and declaratory relief. The cross-complaint arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the cause of action asserted by the plaintiff against the defendants. The judge has considered the arguments and evidence submitted by both sides and exercises its discretion to grant the motion. The interests of judicial economy would be served by allowing the cross-complaint, as there is a substantial overlap in the factual allegations of the first amended complaint and the proposed cross-complaint.
