## English Summary

The Judge has denied a motion by attorney Brandon J. Sweeney to be relieved as counsel for several defendants in a lawsuit filed by Armando Santiago. The Judge found that the attorney's declaration explaining the reasons for the motion was insufficient. 

Specifically, the Judge noted that the declaration did not clearly identify which clients the attorney spoke to confirm their addresses, and it was unclear if the attorney attempted to serve the motion on all clients. 

The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning the attorney can refile the motion if they correct the deficiencies identified by the Judge.
