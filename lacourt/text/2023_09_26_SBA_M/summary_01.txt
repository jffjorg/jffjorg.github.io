And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has denied, without prejudice, the motion of Counsel, Brandon J. Sweeney, to be relieved as counsel for the defendants, Command Security Systems, Inc., et al. The motion was denied due to deficiencies in the attorney declaration, including the failure to identify the client that counsel purportedly spoke to confirm their last known address, failure to show proof of service of the motion on client Balbir Gill, and confusing references to Amarjeet Gill. The Judge noted that the attorney-client relationship has breakdown, but the motion was denied because it did not meet the requirements of CRC Rule 3.1362.
