## Summary of Judge's Tentative Ruling

**Case:**  22TRCV00926
**Plaintiff:** Alexis Mikayla Rodriguez
**Defendant:** LA County MTA, Uber Technologies, Inc., Rasier, LLC, Rasier-CA, LLC, Kenneth Wells, Shuyun Yang

**Summary:**

The judge is **granting** the motion by Uber Technologies, Inc., Rasier, LLC, and Rasier-CA, LLC to compel arbitration and stay all proceedings against them. 

**Key Points:**

* **Arbitration Agreement:** The judge finds that a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement exists between the plaintiff and Uber defendants. The agreement was accepted when the plaintiff initially registered for an Uber account and later by accepting updated terms of service through email and in-app notifications.
* **Scope:** The arbitration agreement covers the plaintiff's claims against Uber defendants, including her allegations related to a car accident.
* **FAA:** The judge finds that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) governs the arbitration agreement, preempting any conflicting state law, including California Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2(c). This section usually allows courts to consider conflicting rulings on common issues of law or fact in parallel court proceedings and arbitration.
* **Delegation Clause:** The judge finds that the arbitration agreement's delegation clause, which gives the arbitrator the authority to decide disputes about the agreement's validity and applicability, is clear and enforceable.
* **Waiver:** The judge rejects the plaintiff's argument that the Uber defendants waived their right to arbitration due to delay. The judge found no unreasonable delay in filing the motion to compel arbitration and no evidence of inconsistent actions by the defendants.


**Intention:**  The judge is essentially concluding that the parties agreed to resolve their dispute through arbitration, and this agreement should be enforced.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to compel arbitration filed by the defendants (Uber Technologies, Inc., Rasier, LLC, Rasier-CA, LLC) in a lawsuit brought by plaintiff Alexis Mikayla Rodriguez against LA County MTA and others. The lawsuit arises from an accident that occurred on April 3, 2020, in which the plaintiff was a passenger in a motor vehicle that was involved in a collision with a LA County MTA bus.

The defendants argue that the plaintiff's claims against them are subject to arbitration under an arbitration agreement that the plaintiff entered into when she registered for an Uber account. The plaintiff does not dispute the existence of the arbitration agreement, but argues that the court should not compel arbitration because there are other defendants (LA County MTA, Kenneth Wells, Shuyun Yang) who are not subject to the arbitration agreement and because there is a risk of conflicting rulings on common issues of law and fact if the case is litigated in both state court and in arbitration.

The court finds that the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable and grants the motion to compel arbitration. The court also finds that the defendants have not unreasonably delayed in seeking arbitration and that there is no evidence of waiver. The motion is granted, and the moving defendants are ordered to give notice of the ruling.
