Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay all proceedings in this case. The court finds that the existence of an agreement to arbitrate between the plaintiff, Alexis Mikayla Rodriguez, and the Uber defendants, Uber Technologies, Inc., Rasier, LLC, and Rasier-CA, LLC, is enforceable. The court also finds that the scope of the arbitration agreement covers the plaintiff's claims against the Uber defendants. The court holds that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) preempts the applicability of California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) §1281.2(c) and thus grants the motion to compel arbitration.
