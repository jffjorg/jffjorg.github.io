## Tentative Ruling Summary:

**Case Number:** 23TRCV00887
**Plaintiffs:** Guillermo Flores et al.
**Defendants:** Oasis NOI Holding, LP and 13605 Vermont Apartments, LLC

**Key Points:**

* **Demurrer:**  Sustained with 20 days leave to amend for the 7th cause of action (Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress - IIED) because the complaint lacks specific factual allegations of "extreme and outrageous" conduct. 
* **Motion to Strike:** Granted with 20 days leave to amend regarding punitive damages requested in the complaint. The court found the allegations insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages due to their conclusory nature and lack of specific details about each defendant's actions.

**Background:**

* Plaintiffs allege various property issues (cockroach infestation, plumbing problems, mold, lack of heating, structural damage) stemming from defendants' ownership and management of the property. 
* They claim these issues constitute a breach of warranty of habitability, breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, nuisance (negligence & intentional tort), negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED), negligent maintenance, and IIED.

**Legal Arguments:**

* **Demurrer:** Defendants argued the IIED claim lacked specific facts demonstrating "extreme and outrageous" conduct.
* **Motion to Strike:** Defendants argued the allegations were insufficient to support punitive damages because they lacked evidence of oppression, fraud, or malice.

**Court's Reasoning:**

* The court agreed with defendants, finding the IIED claim lacked specific factual allegations of outrageous conduct exceeding societal norms. 
* The court also found the allegations regarding punitive damages were conclusory and failed to demonstrate the necessary elements of oppression, fraud, or malice.

**Next Steps:**

* Plaintiffs have 20 days to amend their complaint to address the court's concerns regarding the IIED claim and the allegations supporting punitive damages.

English Summary:
This is a tentative ruling by the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, Southwest District, Torrance Dept. M for case number 23TRCV00887, scheduled for hearing on September 26, 2023. The plaintiffs, Guillermo Flores, Gloria Saran, and Genesis Saran, filed a complaint on March 23, 2023 against defendants Oasis NOI Holding, LP and 13605 Vermont Apartments, LLC for various causes of action including tortious breach of warranty of habitability, breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, nuisance (negligence), NIED, negligent maintenance of the premises, nuisance (intentional tort), and IIED.

Defendants demurred to the 7th cause of action for IIED, arguing that it fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. The court sustained the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend, finding that the allegations lack specificity and are conclusory, and do not show that defendants engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct or that such conduct exceeded all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.

Defendants also moved to strike punitive damages, prayer as to 1st cause of action for tortious breach of warranty of habitability, 6th cause of action for nuisance (intentional tort), and 7th cause of action for IIED. The court granted the motion with leave to amend, finding that the allegations are conclusory and do not show oppression, fraud, or malice. Further, as alleged, defendants owned/managed the property at different times and there are no allegations specific to each defendant.

## Summary of Tentative Ruling in Case 23TRCV00887

This case involves a dispute between landlords (Oasis NOI Holding, LP and 13605 Vermont Apartments, LLC) and tenants (Guillermo Flores, et al.) over alleged habitability issues at a rental property.

**Key Points:**

* **Demurrer Sustained with Leave to Amend:** The court sustained the demurrer to the 7th cause of action (Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress - IIED) because the plaintiff's allegations are too general and don't sufficiently demonstrate "extreme and outrageous" conduct by the defendants.
* **Motion to Strike Granted with Leave to Amend:** The court granted the motion to strike various claims for punitive damages, finding that the allegations are also too general and don't establish the required elements of oppression, fraud, or malice.
* **Background:** The plaintiffs allege ongoing issues with the property, including cockroaches, plumbing problems, mold, and structural damage, despite complaints to the defendants. 
* **Legal Issues:** The ruling focuses on the legal standards for IIED and punitive damages, emphasizing the need for specific factual allegations to support these claims.

**Intentions:** The court aims to give the plaintiffs an opportunity to amend their complaint to address the deficiencies identified in the ruling.

**Significance:** This ruling highlights the importance of carefully pleading legal claims, particularly those requiring high thresholds like IIED and punitive damages.

**Case Number:** 23TRCV00887

**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023

**Parties:**

- Plaintiffs: Guillermo Flores, Gloria Saran, Genesis Saran, Gloria Saran, and Gerson Flores
- Defendants: Oasis NOI Holding, LP and 13605 Vermont Apartments, LLC

**Background:**

On March 23, 2023, plaintiffs filed a complaint against defendants for various torts, including IIED, related to the health and safety violations at the property rented by plaintiffs.

**Legal Authority:**

- Courts read the allegations liberally and in context.
- A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.
- The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.
- Sufficient facts are the essential facts of the case “with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his cause of action.”
- The court may, upon a motion, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.
- The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.

**Ruling:**

- The demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave to amend as to the 7th cause of action for IIED in the complaint.
- The motion to strike is granted with 20 days leave to amend.

**Reasoning:**

- The complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action for IIED.
- The allegations are generalized and conclusory, lacking specific factual allegations to show that defendants engaged in "extreme and outrageous" conduct.
- The allegations are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages as they are conclusory and do not show oppression, fraud, or malice.
- The allegations do not specify each defendant's actions and are devoid of any factual assertions supporting a conclusion of oppression, fraud, or malice.

**Order:**

- Defendants are ordered to give notice of ruling.
