## Tentative Ruling Summary:

**Case Number:** 23TRCV00887
**Plaintiffs:** Guillermo Flores et al.
**Defendants:** Oasis NOI Holding, LP and 13605 Vermont Apartments, LLC

**Key Points:**

* **Demurrer:**  Sustained with 20 days leave to amend for the 7th cause of action (Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress - IIED) because the complaint lacks specific factual allegations of "extreme and outrageous" conduct. 
* **Motion to Strike:** Granted with 20 days leave to amend regarding punitive damages requested in the complaint. The court found the allegations insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages due to their conclusory nature and lack of specific details about each defendant's actions.

**Background:**

* Plaintiffs allege various property issues (cockroach infestation, plumbing problems, mold, lack of heating, structural damage) stemming from defendants' ownership and management of the property. 
* They claim these issues constitute a breach of warranty of habitability, breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, nuisance (negligence & intentional tort), negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED), negligent maintenance, and IIED.

**Legal Arguments:**

* **Demurrer:** Defendants argued the IIED claim lacked specific facts demonstrating "extreme and outrageous" conduct.
* **Motion to Strike:** Defendants argued the allegations were insufficient to support punitive damages because they lacked evidence of oppression, fraud, or malice.

**Court's Reasoning:**

* The court agreed with defendants, finding the IIED claim lacked specific factual allegations of outrageous conduct exceeding societal norms. 
* The court also found the allegations regarding punitive damages were conclusory and failed to demonstrate the necessary elements of oppression, fraud, or malice.

**Next Steps:**

* Plaintiffs have 20 days to amend their complaint to address the court's concerns regarding the IIED claim and the allegations supporting punitive damages.

English Summary:
This is a tentative ruling by the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, Southwest District, Torrance Dept. M for case number 23TRCV00887, scheduled for hearing on September 26, 2023. The plaintiffs, Guillermo Flores, Gloria Saran, and Genesis Saran, filed a complaint on March 23, 2023 against defendants Oasis NOI Holding, LP and 13605 Vermont Apartments, LLC for various causes of action including tortious breach of warranty of habitability, breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, nuisance (negligence), NIED, negligent maintenance of the premises, nuisance (intentional tort), and IIED.

Defendants demurred to the 7th cause of action for IIED, arguing that it fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. The court sustained the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend, finding that the allegations lack specificity and are conclusory, and do not show that defendants engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct or that such conduct exceeded all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.

Defendants also moved to strike punitive damages, prayer as to 1st cause of action for tortious breach of warranty of habitability, 6th cause of action for nuisance (intentional tort), and 7th cause of action for IIED. The court granted the motion with leave to amend, finding that the allegations are conclusory and do not show oppression, fraud, or malice. Further, as alleged, defendants owned/managed the property at different times and there are no allegations specific to each defendant.
