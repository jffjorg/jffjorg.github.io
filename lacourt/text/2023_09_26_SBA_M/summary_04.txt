And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel responses to its initial form and special interrogatories, as well as its request for production of documents. The plaintiff, Mamdouh Khalaf, failed to serve responses to the defendant's discovery requests, despite being properly served and having ample time to respond. As a result, the court has ordered the plaintiff to respond to the defendant's discovery requests without objections within 20 days. Additionally, the court has ordered the plaintiff to produce all documents and things in their possession, custody, or control, which are responsive to the defendant's request, within 20 days. The court has also awarded sanctions in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff in the amount of $630 for all three motions.
