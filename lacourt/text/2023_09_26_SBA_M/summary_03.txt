Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for reconsideration filed by plaintiff Elissa Riley. The motion seeks to reconsider the court's previous order vacating the defaults entered against defendants Avana Rancho Palos Verdes, Greystar California, Inc., and GS Palos Verdes, LLC. The plaintiff argues that the court erred in granting the motion to vacate defaults because the requests for entry of default were amended to refer to the last operative complaint, and that defendant Avana does not have an agent for service "made known to the public" and is not a legal entity or dba. The defendant argues that the plaintiff failed to address any of the grounds for reconsideration under CCP §1008 or file the requisite declaration, and that the exhibits attached to the plaintiff's motions were reviewed by the court in consideration of the motions to vacate and opposition. The court finds that the plaintiff has not met her burden of showing new or different facts, circumstances, or law, and accordingly denies the motion for reconsideration. The defendants are ordered to give notice of the ruling.
