Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for reconsideration filed by plaintiff Elissa Riley. The motion seeks to reconsider the court's previous order vacating the defaults entered against defendants Avana Rancho Palos Verdes, Greystar California, Inc., and GS Palos Verdes, LLC. The plaintiff argues that the court erred in granting the motion to vacate defaults because the requests for entry of default were amended to refer to the last operative complaint, and that defendant Avana does not have an agent for service "made known to the public" and is not a legal entity or dba. The defendant argues that the plaintiff failed to address any of the grounds for reconsideration under CCP §1008 or file the requisite declaration, and that the exhibits attached to the plaintiff's motions were reviewed by the court in consideration of the motions to vacate and opposition. The court finds that the plaintiff has not met her burden of showing new or different facts, circumstances, or law, and accordingly denies the motion for reconsideration. The defendants are ordered to give notice of the ruling.

English summary:
The court has considered the motions for reconsideration made by the plaintiff, Elissa Riley, and denied them. The case involves Elissa Riley, the plaintiff, and the defendants, Greystar California and Avana Rancho Palos Verdes. The plaintiff had filed a complaint against the defendants for breach of contract and nuisance, alleging that she moved into the apartment on August 24, 2022, based on a lease agreement signed on August 22, 2022. However, she discovered a noise nuisance from her neighbor, which interfered with her sleep and ability to operate her two businesses. Despite informing the apartment manager and defendant about the noise problem, the defendant failed to disclose the nuisance, which it had prior knowledge of for many years. The plaintiff has suffered emotional distress and loss of income due to the noise nuisance and withheld rent according to tenant rights. However, the defendant's letter campaign notices demanding plaintiff to pay or quit are considered constructive eviction. The plaintiff had filed a FAC, SAC, and TAC, and the court had granted leave to amend nunc pro tunc the SAC and TAC. Defaults were entered against the defendants on June 8, 2023, which were later vacated on July 28, 2023. The plaintiff argues that the court erred in vacating the defaults and that defendant Avana does not have an agent for service made known to the public. However, the defendants argue that the plaintiff failed to address any of the grounds for reconsideration under CCP §1008 or file the requisite declaration. The court notes that the plaintiff failed to file a proof of service of the motions but finds that plaintiff has not met her burden of showing new or different facts, circumstances, or law. Therefore, the motions are denied, and defendants are ordered to give notice of ruling.

The court had previously granted the defendants' motions to vacate the defaults, and the plaintiff is now seeking reconsideration of that order. However, the court finds that the plaintiff has not met her burden of showing new or different facts, circumstances, or law, and therefore denies the motions for reconsideration.
