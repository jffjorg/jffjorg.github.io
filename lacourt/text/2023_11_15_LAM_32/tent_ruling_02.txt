ISABEL SANCHEZ
  ESPINOSA, et al.,
                        Plaintiffs,
            v.
 
AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR
  CO., INC., 
                        Defendant.
  


 
  Case No.:  21STCV46725
  Hearing Date: November 15, 2023
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On December 22, 2021, Plaintiffs
Isabel Sanchez Espinosa and Byri Diana Moran filed this lemon law action
against Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc., asserting causes of action
for breach of warranty under the Song-Beverly Act and fraudulent concealment. 
            On March 2, 2022, the Court granted Defendant’s
motion to compel arbitration. On October 12, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the instant
motion for reconsideration of the Court’s order in light of Ford Motor
Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324 (Ochoa). Defendant filed
its opposition on November 2, 2023. Plaintiff filed her reply on November 7,
2023.
LEGAL STANDARD
“When an application for an order has been
made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or
granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within
10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order
and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to
the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and
modify, amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall
state by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge,
what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008(a).) “If a court at
any time determines that there has been a change of law that warrants it to
reconsider a prior order it entered, it may do so on its own motion and enter a
different order.” (Id., subd. (c).) 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiffs’ motion is untimely
because it was made more than ten days after the Court’s order granting arbitration.
Plaintiff also waited six months after the publication of Ochoa. Additionally,
Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486 has not been
overturned. Ochoa and subsequent cases represent a split in authority,
and Ochoa is currently under review. (See Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v.
Superior Court (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 456; Cal. Rules of Ct., Rule 8.1115.)
It would be inefficient to return a case that was compelled to arbitration over
1.5 years ago back to court. For these reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration
is denied, and the Court declines to reconsider its order sua sponte. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration
is DENIED.
