The judge has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff has the opportunity to re-file the complaint with additional factual allegations to support their claims. The judge notes that the plaintiff failed to file an opposition to the demurrer and that the FAC contains no factual allegations, only citations to laws and regulations. The judge has also noted that the meet and confer requirement has been complied with.
