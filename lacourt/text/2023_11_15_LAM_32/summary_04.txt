And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to withdraw from arbitration. The plaintiff, Concepcion Gonzalez-Estrada, had filed a lawsuit against the defendants, Sharon Care Center, LLC and Ma Cecilia B. Lingat, stemming from her care at a nursing facility. The parties had initially agreed to arbitration, but the defendants failed to pay the required arbitration fees within 30 days. The judge found that the defendants' failure to pay the fees constituted a material breach of the arbitration agreement, entitling the plaintiff to withdraw from arbitration under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.97. The judge also rejected the defendants' arguments that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) applied, finding that the parties had not explicitly agreed to adopt the FAA's procedural rules. The judge's decision allows the plaintiff to proceed with her lawsuit in court, rather than continuing with the arbitration process.
