     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to withdraw from
  arbitration 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On January 11, 2023, Plaintiff Concepcion
Gonzalez-Estrada, through her guardian ad litem Jessica Estrada, filed this
action against Defendants Sharon Care Center, LLC and Ma Cecilia B. Lingat stemming
from Plaintiff’s care at a nursing facility. The operative First Amended
Complaint was filed on March 1, 2023 and asserts causes of action for elder
abuse, negligence, and violation of the Patient’s Bill of Rights. The parties
initially stipulated to arbitration based on an arbitration agreement. 
On October 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
instant motion to withdraw from arbitration based on Defendants’ failure to pay
arbitration fees. Defendants filed their opposition on November 1, 2023.
Plaintiff filed her reply on November 7, 2023.
LEGAL STANDARD
“In an employment
or consumer arbitration that requires . . . the drafting party to pay certain
fees and costs before the arbitration can proceed, if the fees or costs to
initiate an arbitration proceeding are not paid within 30 days after the due
date, the drafting party is in material breach of the arbitration agreement, is
in default of the arbitration, and waives its right to compel arbitration under
Section 1281.2.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.97(a)(1).) “If the drafting party
materially breaches the arbitration agreement and is in default under
subdivision (a), the employee or consumer may . . . [w]ithdraw the claim from
arbitration and proceed in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.” (Id., subd. (b).)
DISCUSSION
            Section
1281.7 is applied strictly, and the Court may not consider any other factors or
mitigating circumstances. (Espinoza v.
Superior Court (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 761, 775-76; DeLeon v. Juanita Foods (2022) 85 Cal.App.5th 740, 749.) A drafting party is in breach of the
arbitration agreement simply if it does not pay the requisite fees within
thirty days. 
            Here,
it is undisputed that Defendants did not pay the required fees within thirty
days. Therefore, Plaintiff is entitled to withdraw from arbitration under
Section 1281.97. However, Defendants advance several arguments against applying
Section 1281.97, which the Court addresses in turn.  
I. Federal Arbitration Act
            While
the FAA does not preempt Section 1281.97 (Gallo
v. Wood Ranch USA, Inc. (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 621,
642), parties may nonetheless contract to apply the procedural rules of the FAA
as opposed to the CAA (Valencia v. Smyth (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 153, 177). Because state procedural rules apply
by default, and the FAA is intended to apply in federal proceedings, “the FAA’s
procedural provisions do not apply in state court unless the parties expressly
adopt them.” (Ibid.) Where the parties expressly agree to adopt the FAA’s procedural rules,
Section 1281.97 would not apply. (See Espinoza
v. Superior Court (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 761, 785-87.) 
            Here,
the arbitration agreement provides that “[t]his agreement shall be construed
and enforced in accordance with and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and
the procedures set forth in the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern any
petition to compel arbitration.” (Moore Decl., Ex. A, § I.8.) However, agreeing
to interpret the contract under the FAA, and to apply the FAA to any motion to
compel arbitration, is not the same as agreeing to incorporate the procedural
provisions of the FAA to the arbitration itself. (See Valencia, supra, 185
Cal.App.4th at p. 178; Espinoza, supra, 83 Cal.App.5th at pp. 786-87.) 
Additionally, the
stipulation to submit to arbitration provides that “[t]his stipulation to
submit the entire Complaint to binding arbitration is made and enforceable
pursuant to Part III, Title 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure § 1280 et seq.,
that governs private, contractual arbitration.” (July 5, 2023 Stipulation, §
10.) Because the parties have not expressly agreed to adopt the procedural
rules of the FAA, the CAA applies by default.
II. Voluntary Stipulation
            Defendants
argue that Section 1281.97 does not apply because the parties voluntarily stipulated
to arbitration as opposed to being ordered by the Court. However, this was not
a dispositive factor in any of the cited cases discussing withdrawal from
arbitration. Defendants cite no authority for the proposition that application
of Section 1281.97 depends on this factor. Plaintiff did not waive her rights
under Section 1281.97 simply because she acknowledged a valid arbitration
agreement and decided to avoid wasting court resources contesting a motion to
compel.  
III. Consumer Arbitration
            Section
1281.97 applies “[i]n an employment or consumer arbitration.” This is clearly
not an employment arbitration. However, Defendants argue that it is also not a
consumer arbitration because the arbitration agreement does not identify it as
such. However, Defendants cite no authority for the proposition that a consumer
arbitration must be so identified in the arbitration agreement. 
            Defendants
next argue that this case does not match the definition of “consumer
arbitration” as set forth in the California Rules of Court Ethics Standards
because Plaintiff was not required to sign the arbitration agreement. This
exact argument was rejected by the Court of Appeal in Williams v. West Coast Hospitals, Inc. (2022) 86 Cal.App.5th 1054, 1073-74. “The purpose for which the
defined term ‘consumer arbitration’ as used in the ethical standards is to
delineate the cases in which certain disclosures are required.” (Id. at p. 1074.)
There is “no reason to believe that the Legislature intended to appropriate
this definition of ‘consumer arbitration’ for use in section 1281.98.” (Ibid.) 
“We take the
ordinary meaning of ‘consumer arbitration,’ accordingly, to be arbitration
involving a ‘consumer’ and a controversy arising from the consumer's
transaction with the drafting party, irrespective of how the parties reached
their predispute agreement to arbitrate.” (Williams,
supra, 86 Cal.App.5th at p. 1073.) “‘Consumer’ means an
individual who seeks, uses, or acquires, by purchase or lease, any goods or
services for personal, family, or household purposes.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1280(c).) Plaintiff is a consumer under this definition. Therefore, this is a
consumer arbitration for purposes of Section 1281.97. Whether the agreement was
voluntary or mandatory is immaterial. 
            Because
Defendants have not articulated any valid reason not to apply the CAA, Section
1281.97 applies and allows Plaintiff to withdraw from arbitration.  
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s
motion to withdraw from arbitration is GRANTED.
