And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge on a motion for reconsideration filed by plaintiffs Isabel Sanchez Espinosa and Byri Diana Moran. The plaintiffs are seeking to reconsider the court's order granting defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration. The plaintiffs argue that the court's order was affected by a change in the law, specifically the case Ford Motor Warranty Cases (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324 (Ochoa). However, the court finds that the plaintiff's motion is untimely, as it was filed more than 10 days after the court's original order and that the plaintiff waited six months after the publication of Ochoa. Additionally, the court notes that Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486 has not been overturned and that Ochoa is currently under review. The court declines to reconsider its order and denies the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration.
