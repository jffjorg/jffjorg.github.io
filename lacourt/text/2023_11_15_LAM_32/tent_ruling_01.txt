FERNANDO MENDOZA,
                        Plaintiff,
            v.
 
J&A MERCADO’S PLUMBING & ROOTER,
  et al., 
                        Defendants.
  


 
  Case No.:  21STCV13893
  Hearing Date:  November 15, 2023
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to compel deposition 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On April 12, 2021, Plaintiff filed
this employment discrimination action against Defendants J&A Mercado’s
Plumbing & Rooter, Juan Mercado, and Adriana Mercado. 
            On October 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to compel the deposition of Defendant Juan Mercado. Defendant
has not filed an opposition.
LEGAL STANDARD
“If, after service of a deposition notice,
a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party, or a person designated by an organization that is a party under Section
2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails
to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection
any document … described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and
the production for inspection of any document … described in the deposition
notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).)
 
DISCUSSION
            Defense counsel had previously
expressed that he would be amenable to setting depositions given a trial
continuance. (Berkowitz Decl., Ex. A.) The trial was indeed continued, with Defendants’
depositions expected to take place before the final status conference scheduled
for October 26, 2023. (Id., Ex. B.) Plaintiff’s counsel contacted
defense counsel about the Court order, and defense counsel promised to get back.
(Id., ¶ 10.) Defense counsel never got back to Plaintiff’s counsel and
additionally blocked his email. (Id., ¶ 11.) 
            On September 28, 2023, Plaintiff
physically served deposition notices at defense counsel’s office. (Berkowitz
Decl. ¶ 11.) The notice scheduled the remote deposition of Defendant Juan
Mercado for October 10, 2023. (Id., Ex. D.) Defense counsel claimed the
service was ineffective because his office was closed at the time, even though the
service occurred during normal business hours. (Id., ¶ 12.) A registered
process server confirmed that the notice was served “[b]y posting in a
conspicuous place on the property therein described, there being no person of suitable
age or discretion to be found.” (Id., Ex. E.) 
            Defense counsel then substituted out
of the case, and Plaintiff’s counsel communicated with Defendant Juan Mercado
directly. (Berkowitz Decl. ¶¶ 13-14.) Mr. Mercado refused to discuss his
deposition during calls from Plaintiff’s counsel and repeatedly hung up. (Id.,
¶ 14.)
            The undisputed facts above
demonstrate that Defendant has failed to appear for deposition despite valid
notice. The facts also suggest intentional evasion of discovery. As such,
sanctions are warranted in the amount of $1,060, representing 2.5 hours at $400
per hour, plus a $60 filing fee.
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel
deposition is GRANTED. Defendant Juan Mercado’s deposition shall take place
on  __________________.  The Court sanctions Defendant Juan Mercado in
the amount of $1,060, to be paid within 30 days.
