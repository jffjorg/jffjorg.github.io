     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant county of los angeles’ demurrer
  to first amended complaint




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On June 16, 2023, Plaintiff Alma
Rosa Hernandez filed this action against Defendants County of Los Angeles (erroneously
sued as Los Angeles County High Desert Regional Health Center) and SEIU Local
721. The complaint was labeled as one for discrimination and violation of
labor/union rights. However, the complaint contained no factual allegations. Instead,
the complaint merely attached prior complaints filed with the Civil Rights
Department and Labor Commissioner’s Office. On August 21, 2023, the Court sustained
the County’s demurrer with leave to amend. Plaintiff filed the operative First
Amended Complaint on September 8, 2023.
            On September 29, 2023, the County filed
the instant demurrer to the FAC. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether a
pleading states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a).) A
demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the defects
appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the pleading, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to strike,
the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the party who
filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the motion to
strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be reached
through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.) The Court notes
that Defendant has complied with the meet and confer requirement. (See Ortega
Decl.) 
DISCUSSION
            The FAC contains no factual
allegations from which any cause of action may be inferred. The FAC summarizes
the law on motions to strike and administrative exhaustion. The FAC also cites
to federal regulations and the California Civil Code for the proposition that
an employer must keep employee information safe. The complaint concludes with
the statement: “I was discriminated by my employer and I am pleading with you
for a fair trial.” Plaintiff cannot plead a cause of action by merely citing
different laws, or by making the conclusory statement that she was
discriminated against. As with the original complaint, the FAC contains no facts
supporting a discrimination claim or any other cause of action. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant County of Los Angeles’s
demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
