SMG MOUNTAIN INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, LLC,
       
               
                      Cross-Complainant,
             
             v.
 
ANDREW FROMM, et al.,
                      Cross-Defendants.


 



 
BACKGROUND
            On December 12, 2022, Plaintiff and
Cross-Defendant Service Management Group Holdings, LLC (SMG Holdings) filed this
action against Defendant and Cross-Complainant SMG Mountain Intermediate Holdings,
LLC (SMG Mountain), asserting a single cause of action for breach of contract. 
            The complaint alleges that SMG
Holdings and an individual named Andrew Fromm (the Sellers) entered into an
Equity Purchase Agreement (EPA) with SMG Mountain (the Buyer). Under the EPA,
SMG Mountain agreed to purchase all outstanding membership interests in SMG
Holdings. As part of the transaction, the parties agreed to set aside $860,000
in an Indemnity Escrow Account. Under the EPA, the Sellers were required to indemnify
the Buyer for covered losses related to the transaction. If no indemnifiable
loss occurred by the one-year anniversary of the closing date, the escrow
amount was to be distributed to SMG Holdings. SMG Mountain has refused to
distribute the escrow amount to SMG Holdings despite allegedly never making any
valid claim for indemnity within the time limit. 
            On December 23, 2022, SMG Mountain filed
a cross-complaint against Fromm and SMG Holdings. The operative First Amended
Cross-Complaint was filed on August 25, 2023. The FACC asserts ten causes of
action in the following manner: (i) breach of contract as to Customers 1 and 2;
(ii) fraud by misrepresentation as to Customers 1 through 4; and (iii) fraud by
omission as to Customers 1 through 4.   
            The FACC alleges that Fromm lied and
concealed information from SMG Mountain to inflate the price of his company,
SMG Holdings. The FACC alleges that Fromm knew of at least four customers who
were dissatisfied with the services provided by SMG Holdings. The customers ultimately
did not renew their contracts with SMG Holdings. The loss of these customers
affected SMG Holdings’ future earnings, which in turn affected the fair price of
the transaction described above. Fromm allegedly made false representations and
concealed information about SMG Holdings’ relationships with these four
customers. Because of Fromm’s deception, SMG Holdings was allegedly sold at an
inflated price, approximately $60 million above fair value. 
            On October 10, 2023, Fromm and SMG Holdings
filed the instant demurrer to the FACC. SMG Mountain filed its opposition on
November 1, 2023. Fromm and SMG Holdings filed their reply on November 7, 2023.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether a
pleading states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a).) A
demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the defects
appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the pleading, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action or defense. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to strike,
the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the party who
filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the motion to
strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be reached
through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.) The Court notes
that Cross-Defendants have complied with the meet and confer requirement. (See Sayers
Decl.) 
DISCUSSION
            The EPA contains a choice of law provision
stating that it is governed by Delaware law. (FACC, Ex. A, § 10.11.)
Additionally, the EPA contains an anti-reliance clause precluding common law
fraud claims except those arising under Delaware law. (Id., §§ 5.08, 1.01.)
Accordingly, the Court’s analysis will proceed under Delaware law.  
I.
Breach of Contract
Breach of contract requires: (1) a
contractual obligation; (2) a breach of that obligation; and (3) a resulting
damage. (Great Hill Equity Partners IV, LP v. SIG Growth Equity Fund I, LLLP
(Del. Ch., Dec. 3, 2018, No. CV 7906-VCG) 2018 WL 6311829, at *45.) 
Cross-Defendants argue that Fromm cannot
be liable in his personal capacity because the representations and warranties in
the EPA were made solely by “the Seller,” or SMG Holdings. However, the EPA
provides that “Seller and Fromm, on a joint and several basis, agree to
indemnify and defend each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties” against losses resulting
from, inter alia, breaches of any warranties made in the EPA. (EPA §
8.02.) The FACC alleges that the Buyer requested such indemnification from
Cross-Defendants but that Cross-Defendants rejected the claim. (FACC ¶¶ 88-90.)
Therefore, a breach of contract has been alleged against Fromm personally. 
Cross-Defendants also argue that Fromm
cannot be liable because the EPA limits the remedies for breach to the Escrow
Indemnity Amount and proceeds from a certain insurance policy. (EPA §§ 8.04(e),
8.10.) However, if the limitation on remedies applied, it would only restrict
what SMG Mountain may ultimately recover. It does not absolve any party,
including Fromm, of liability.            
II.
Fraud
            The elements of fraud are: “(1) the
defendant falsely represented or omitted facts that the defendant had a duty to
disclose; (2) the defendant knew or believed that the representation was false
or made the representation with a reckless indifference to the truth; (3) the
defendant intended to induce the plaintiff to act or refrain from acting; (4)
the plaintiff acted in justifiable reliance on the representation; and (5) the
plaintiff was injured by its reliance.” (DCV Hldgs., Inc. v. Conagra, Inc.
(Del. 2005) 889 A.2d 954, 958.)  
a. Bootstrapping
            “As a general rule under Delaware
law, where an action is based entirely on a breach of the terms of a contract
between the parties, and not on a violation of an independent duty imposed by
law, a plaintiff must sue in contract and not in tort.” (Pinkert v. John J.
Olivieri, P.A. (D. Del., May 24, 2001, No. CIV. A. 99-380-SLR) 2001 WL
641737, at *5.) A contract claim “cannot be ‘bootstrapped’ into a fraud claim
merely by adding the words ‘fraudulently induced’ or alleging that the
contracting parties never intended to perform.” (Iotex Communications, Inc.
v. Defries (Del. Ch., Dec. 21, 1998) 1998 WL 914265, at *5.) However, “the
anti-bootstrapping rule does not apply where a plaintiff has made
particularized allegations that a seller knew contractual representations were
false or lied regarding the contractual representation.” (Swipe Acquisition
Corporation v. Krauss (Del. Ch., Aug. 25, 2020, No. CV 2019-0509-PAF) 2020
WL 5015863, at *11.)  
            Here, the FACC alleges specific contractual
representations that Cross-Defendants allegedly knew were false. (See FACC ¶¶ 34-70,
129-148, 169-187.) For example, Cross-Defendants represented in Section 4.10 of
the EPA that they had not received any written notice of the cancellation of a Material
Contract. (Id., ¶ 100.) Cross-Defendants also represented in Section
4.21 that they had not received notice that a Material Customer will stop doing
business with SMG Holdings. (Id., ¶ 102.) And Section 4.28 represented
that contracts with certain customers would be renewed upon expiration. (Id.,
¶ 103.) However, at the time of signing the EPA, Cross-Defendants allegedly
knew that these representations were false with respect to each of the four
Customers. (Id., ¶¶ 105, 141, 151, 161.) In other words, the EPA contains
statements of fact that were false when made. Under Delaware law, a fraud claim
may proceed based on such statements. (See Swipe, supra, 2020 WL
5015863, at *12 [“Delaware law permits representations and warranties in a contract
to form the basis for fraud claims”].) 
Therefore, the fraud claims are based on
more than the mere failure to perform a contractual obligation and do not
constitute improper bootstrapping. Cross-Defendants argue that proving
contractual misrepresentation requires evidence of a defendant’s “illicit mind”
and proceed to discuss examples of the types of proof that courts have found
sufficient. However, a demurrer is not concerned with proof. The allegations in
the FACC, when read together and interpreted liberally, support a reasonable
inference that Cross-Defendants committed fraud through contractual
misrepresentations. 
            c. Same Damages
            “[F]raud damages allegations can't
simply ‘rehash’ the damages that were allegedly caused by the claimed breach of
contract.” (EZLinks Golf, LLC v. PCMS Datafit, Inc. (Del. Super. Ct.,
Mar. 13, 2017, No. CVN16C07080PRWCCLD) 2017 WL 1312209, at *7.) “Failure to
plead separate damages is an independent ground for dismissal.” (Bobcat
North America, LLC v. Inland Waste Holdings, LLC (Del. Super. Ct., Sept.
18, 2020, No. CVN17C06170PRWCCLD) 2020 WL 5587683, at *5.) 
            Cross-Defendants argue that the
damages claimed for breach of contract and fraud are materially identical
because in both instances, Cross-Complainant seeks to recover the amount it
purportedly overpaid for the purchase of SMG Holdings. However, fraud and
contract damages are “sufficiently differentiated” where the contract claims
are subject to a damage cap and the fraud claims are not. (Partners &
Simons, Inc. v. Sandbox Acquisitions, LLC (Del. Ch., July 26, 2021, No. CV
2020-0776-MTZ) 2021 WL 3159883, at *6.) Here, the EPA caps damages at $860,000,
except in instances of fraud. (EPA § 8.04(b), (m).) Therefore, the fraud claims
do not rehash contract damages.    
            c. Justifiable Reliance
            Cross-Defendants argue that Cross-Complainant
cannot allege justifiable reliance as to Customer 2 because Cross-Complainant
was aware of negative feedback from Customer 2. Cross-Defendants further argue
that the fraud claim cannot be based on representations made outside of the EPA
because of the anti-reliance clause in Section 5.08. 
            However, Section 5.08 expressly does
not apply to claims arising from fraud. (See In re P3 Health Group Holdings, LLC (Del. Ch., Oct.
26, 2022, No. 2021-0518-JTL) 2022 WL 15035833, at *7 [“In light of the Fraud
Carve Out, the No Representations Clause does not foreclose Hudson from
alleging that it relied on” an outside representation].) Furthermore, receiving
negative feedback from Customer 2 does not preclude Cross-Complainant’s
reliance on Fromm’s specific representation afterwards that “there was no way
that Customer 2 would terminate its multi-year relationship with the Company.”
(FACC ¶ 60.) 
            d. Specificity
            Cross-Defendants argue that the misrepresentations
relating to Customers 1, 3, and 4 are not pled with the requisite specificity because
they are not attributed to Fromm individually. Cross-Defendants argue that at
most, only SMG Holdings had a duty to disclose. However, “[f]lesh and blood
humans also can be held accountable for statements that they cause an
artificial person, like a corporation, to make.” (Prairie Capital III, L.P.
v. Double E Holding Corp. (Del. Ch. 2015) 132 A.3d 35, 59.) “Because it lacks
a body and mind, a corporation only can act through human agents.” (Id.
at p. 60.) “As the human through which the corporate principal acts, a
corporate officer can be held personally liable for the torts he commits and
cannot shield himself behind a corporation when he is a participant.” (Ibid.)

            Here, the allegations in the FACC
sufficiently establish Fromm as an active participant in the fraud who made
representations on behalf of SMG Holdings. Therefore, the fraud claims are properly
pled against Fromm. 
CONCLUSION
            Cross-Defendants’ demurrer is
OVERRULED.
