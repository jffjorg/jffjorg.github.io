And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer to the First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC) filed by SMG Mountain Intermediate Holdings, LLC (SMG Mountain) against Service Management Group Holdings, LLC (SMG Holdings) and Andrew Fromm.

The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the FACC properly alleges a breach of contract and fraud against Fromm and SMG Holdings. Specifically, the judge found that:

* The FACC alleges specific contractual representations that Fromm and SMG Holdings allegedly knew were false.
* The FACC alleges that Fromm and SMG Holdings committed fraud through contractual misrepresentations.
* The FACC alleges justifiable reliance by SMG Mountain on the representations made by Fromm and SMG Holdings.
* The FACC alleges separate damages for breach of contract and fraud, and the judge found that these damages are sufficiently differentiated.

The judge also addressed several arguments raised by SMG Mountain, including that the FACC's allegations of fraud are based on impermissible bootstrapping and that the damages claimed for breach of contract and fraud are materially identical. The judge rejected these arguments, finding that the FACC's allegations of fraud are properly pled and that the damages claimed are sufficiently differentiated.

Overall, the judge's ruling allows the FACC to proceed to trial.
