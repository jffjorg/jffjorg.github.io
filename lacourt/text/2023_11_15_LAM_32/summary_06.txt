And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion to reopen discovery and continue trial. The motion was filed on October 19, 2023, and the plaintiff filed its opposition on November 1, 2023. The defendants claim that they need more time to complete discovery due to the plaintiff's "discovery gamesmanship." However, the judge finds that the defendants are responsible for serving discovery with sufficient time for potential motions to compel, and that they have been aware of the need for such motions for some time. The judge notes that the defendants' current counsel only substituted in recently, but that the defendants have been represented by various counsel throughout the action, and that they cannot use this as an excuse to delay resolution of the case. The judge concludes that the defendants' delay in serving basic discovery regarding the plaintiff's claims and contentions is inexcusable and does not constitute good cause to reopen discovery or continue trial.
