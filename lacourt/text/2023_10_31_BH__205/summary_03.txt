And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Canyon Native Rental Properties, LLC (Landlord) against Judy Choothesa (Tenant). The case involves a landlord-tenant dispute over habitability defects in the premises. Landlord argues that Tenant has failed to plead her claim of deceit with particularity and that the complaint is fatally uncertain. The judge disagrees, finding that Tenant's allegations of non-disclosure and concealment of defects are sufficient to support a claim of deceit. The judge also grants Landlord's motion to strike Tenant's prayer for attorneys' fees, finding that a self-represented litigant is not entitled to recover attorneys' fees. Finally, the judge overrules Landlord's demurrer and grants Landlord's motion to strike.
