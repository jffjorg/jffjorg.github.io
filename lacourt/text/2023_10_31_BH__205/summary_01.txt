And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering granting the plaintiffs' request for a default judgment against the defendants in the amount of $68,856.96. The case arises from a dispute over an unpaid invoice for custom jewelry created by the plaintiffs. The defendants made misrepresentations about their ability to pay, and a check for partial payment was returned for insufficient funds. The plaintiffs filed a complaint, served the defendants, and requested entry of default judgment, which was initially denied due to the amount sought exceeding the amount stated in the complaint. The plaintiffs have since filed a renewed request for default judgment, which is now granted. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have properly complied with the procedural requirements for a default judgment and that default judgment is appropriate given the defendants' failure to appear or file any response.
