And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the landlord's motion for summary judgment against the tenant. The landlord is the owner of the Premises and the tenant failed to pay rent and fees. The landlord served a 3-day notice to pay rent or quit, but the tenant failed to comply. The judge finds that the landlord has met all the essential elements of an unlawful detainer action, including the existence of a landlord-tenant relationship, the tenant's breach, proper notice, and the tenant's failure to comply. The judge awards judgment in favor of the landlord in the total amount of $116,342.34, plus daily damages of $483.33, and prejudgment interest of 10% per annum. The judge also denies the landlord's request for attorneys' fees and costs.
