PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to compel Greystar to provide verified, code-compliant responses,
without objections, to Plaintiff’s request for production of documents, set one,
and form interrogatories, set one, and to award sanctions. 
Greystar
asks the Court to deny the motions. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order
compelling a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including
the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter
7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent exceptional
circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or any attorney
of a party for failure to provide electronically stored information that has
been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of the routine, good
faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may move
for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails
to obey an order compelling answers, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.)   
DISCUSSION 
On
October 16, 2023, Plaintiff served request for production of documents, set one,
and form interrogatories, set one, on Greystar. 
Greystar
did not provide timely responses and had not provided responses by the time Plaintiff
filed these motions. 
Plaintiff now moves to compel verified code-compliant responses without
objections. 
Greystar argues that discovery is premature because
the Court purportedly 
“sustained Greystar’s demurrer as to all of Plaintiff’s causes of action” and
Greystar did not know if Plaintiff would file an amended complaint.  In fact, on December 6, 2023, the Court
overruled Greystar’s demurrer but struck Plaintiff’s punitive damage claim with
leave to amend.  Greystar also argues that it should not be required to
respond to discovery while the case is in the pleading stage.  Greystar is mistaken.  (See L. Edmon and C. Karnow, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:58, p. 8B-13 (Cal.
Practice Guide) [“The right to discovery generally does not depend on the
status of the pleadings.  I.e., the case
need not be ‘at issue.’”]; Mattco Forge, Inc. v. Arthur Young & Co.
(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1429, 1436, fn. 3 [trial court properly rejected
defendant’s prematurity argument because pleading deficiencies generally do not
affect either party’s right to conduct discovery].)  “Thus, for example, discovery may continue after
a demurrer has been sustained with leave to amend, although no amended
complaint has yet been filed – i.e., no valid complaint need be on file.”  (Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 8:59,
p. 8B-13, citing Budget Finance Plan v. Superior Court (McDowell) (1973)
34 Cal.App.3d 794, 797.) 
Plaintiff was permitted to propound interrogatories
and serve a request for production of documents on Greystar “without leave of court at any
time that is 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, [Greystar], whichever occurs first.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.020, subd. (b), 2031.020, subd. (b).)  Greystar filed a demurrer on September 21,
2023 and a motion to strike on September 27, 2023.  Plaintiff served his request for production of
documents and form interrogatories more than ten days later. 
The Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Greystar’s
responses to the request for production of documents and orders Greystar to
provide verified code-compliant responses and to produce the documents,
electronically stored information, and/or other things requested without
objections by April 3, 2024. 
The Court grants Plaintiff’s motion to compel Greystar’s
responses to the form interrogatories and orders Greystar to provide verified
code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories without objections by April
3, 2024. 
Plaintiff requests $2,536.65 in sanctions for each
motion based on 4.5 hours of attorney time at a rate of $550.00 per hour and one
$61.65 filing fee.  Counsel spent 2.5
hours drafting each motion and anticipated spending one hour reviewing the
opposition and preparing a reply and one hour attending the hearing. 
The Court awards $1,123.30 in sanctions for both
motions based on 4 hours of attorney time at a reasonable rate of $250.00 per
hour and 2 filing fees. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS
Plaintiff Justin Ybarra’s motion to compel Defendant Greystar California, Inc.’s
responses to request for production of documents, set one, and orders Defendant
Greystar California, Inc. to provide verified code-compliant responses and to
produce the documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things
requested without objections by April 3, 2024. 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff
Justin Ybarra’s motion to compel Defendant Greystar California, Inc.’s
responses to form interrogatories, set one, and orders Defendant Greystar
California, Inc. to provide verified code-compliant responses to the form
interrogatories without objections by April 3, 2024. 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff Justin Ybarra’s request for
sanctions and orders Defendant Greystar California, Inc. and its counsel to pay
Plaintiff Justin Ybarra $1,123.30 by April 3, 2024.
