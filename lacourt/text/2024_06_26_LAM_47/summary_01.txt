And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint filed by the defendants, Revital Agi and Eydan Berger, and ABR Retail, Inc. The defendants demurred to the third and fourth causes of action, which alleged fraud and unfair competition.

The Judge has overruled the demurrer to the third cause of action, which alleged fraudulent concealment, finding that the allegations were sufficient to state a cause of action. The Judge has also overruled the demurrer to the fourth cause of action, which alleged unfair competition, finding that the allegations were sufficient to state a cause of action.

The Judge has also considered the demurrer filed by ABR Retail, Inc., which demurred to the second, third, fourth, eighth, and ninth causes of action. However, the Judge has found that the demurrer was moot with respect to the second, eighth, and ninth causes of action, as those claims were dismissed by the plaintiff. The Judge has also overruled the demurrer with respect to the third and fourth causes of action, finding that the allegations were sufficient to state a cause of action.

The Judge has scheduled a hearing on the tentative ruling for June 26, 2024, and invites the parties to submit on the tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email.
