Legal Standard
 
A demurrer tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and
Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face
of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing
is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.) The
ultimate facts alleged in the complaint must be deemed true, as well as all
facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged. (Marshall
v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403; see also Shields
v. County of San Diego (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 103, 133 [stating, “[o]n
demurrer, pleadings are read liberally and allegations contained therein are
assumed to be true”].) “This rule of liberal construction means that the
reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not the
defendant.” (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th
1228, 1238.) 
 
Meet and Confer
 
Before filing a demurrer, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party
who has filed the pleading subject to the demurrer and file a declaration
detailing their meet-and-confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a).)
However, an insufficient meet-and-confer process is not grounds
to overrule or sustain a demurrer.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41(a)(4).)
 
The Declaration of Ryan Davis in
support of this motion states that counsel for the parties met and conferred
telephonically on December 11, 2023, but were unable to resolve this dispute.
(Declaration of Ryan Davis ISO Dem ¶ 2.) The Court therefore finds that
Defendants have satisfied the statutory meet-and-confer obligations. 
 
//
Third Cause of Action: Fraud
 
            Defendants
Agi and Berger demur to the third cause of action for fraud for failure to
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action on the basis that
Plaintiff has not pled fraud against these Defendants with the requisite
specificity. 
 
            “The
elements of fraud that will lead to a tort action are: (a) misrepresentation;
(b) knowledge of falsity; (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d)
justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage. (Engalla v. Permanente
Medical Group, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 974.) Every element of the cause
of action for fraud must be alleged in the proper manner and the facts
constituting the fraud must be alleged with sufficient specificity to allow
defendant[s] to understand fully the nature of the charge made. (Stansfield
v. Starkey (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 59, 73.) “This particularity requirement
necessitates pleading facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what
means the representations were tendered.” (Ibid.) “[G]eneral and
conclusory allegations do not suffice.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996)
12 Cal.4th 631, 645.)
 
Here
the Complaint sets forth a series of generalized allegations of
misrepresentations. which Defendants contend are not sufficient under Lazar.
(SAC ¶¶ 162-65.) However, the Second Amended Complaint also alleges that the
Defendants collectively concealed payments made to various individuals and
entities with the intent to defraud Plaintiff. (SAC ¶¶ 167-68.) Although
Defendants Agi and Berger acknowledge that the Second Amended Complaint alleges
concealment, they neglect to discuss the lowered standard for specificity in
the context of allegations of fraudulent concealment. (Alfaro
v. Community Housing Improvement System & Planning Association, Inc.
(2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1384 [“How does one show ‘how’ and ‘by what means’
something didn’t happen, or ‘when’ it never happened, or ‘where’ it never
happened?”].) Instead, such details, in the context of a fraudulent concealment
claim, “are properly the subject of discovery, not demurrer.” (Id. at
1384-85.) 
 
Moreover, despite admitting the existence of the concealment claim,
Defendants fail to directly address the elements of such a claim, which are (1) concealment or suppression of a material fact; (2) by a
defendant with a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff; (3) intent to
defraud the plaintiff by intentionally concealing or suppressing the fact; (4)
the plaintiff was unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he or she did
if he or she had known of the concealed or suppressed fact; and (5) the
plaintiff sustained damage as a result of the concealment or suppression of
fact. (Hambridge v. Healthcare Partners Medical Group, Inc. (2015) 238
Cal.App.4th 124, 162.) Defendants indirectly address the elements of intent and
detrimental reliance by arguing that the Second Amended Complaint does not
allege intent to defraud or that Plaintiff would have acted differently had he
been aware of the concealed facts. The Second Amended Complaint expressly
alleges, however, an intent to defraud Plaintiff through concealment. (SAC ¶
167.) Moreover, construed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as required
on a demurrer even in the context of fraud claims, Plaintiff alleges that the
information concealed was material—i.e., that he did not know of it and
it would have affected his course of conduct had he known. (SAC ¶ 168.) These
allegations are sufficient to satisfy the elements for fraudulent concealment
on demurrer. 
 
The Court observes that Defendants assert in their reply
that Plaintiff did not allege how he personally was harmed by Defendants’
conduct. This argument was not raised in Defendants’ moving papers, and they
offer no justification for this failure. The Court therefore refuses to
consider this argument. (See Balboa Ins. Co. v. Aguirre (1983) 149
Cal.App.3rd 1002, 1010 [“points raised in a reply brief for the first time will
not be considered unless good cause is shown for the failure to present them
before.”].) 
 
Because the third cause of action sets forth a valid claim
for fraudulent concealment, Defendants’ challenge to this claim is not
well-taken, notwithstanding any putative deficiency in any allegations of
fraudulent misrepresentation. (Fire Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452 citing Campbell v. Genshlea (1919) 180
Cal. 213, 217 [“Ordinarily, a general demurrer does not lie to a portion of a
cause of action, and if any part of a cause of action is properly pleaded, the
demurrer will be overruled.”].) 
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Demurrer to the third cause of
action for fraud is OVERRULED.
 
Fourth Cause of Action: Unfair Competition
 
            Defendants
also demur to the fourth cause of action for unfair competition for failure to
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Defendants contend that
this claim is deficient to the extent that it is predicated on any allegations
of fraud. As the Court has rejected Defendants’ challenge to the third cause of
action, this line of argument fails. Further, general demurrers do not lie to
portions of a cause of action. (Fire Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 446, 452.) Defendants’ attack on this claim is therefore
without merit for this independent reason.
 
            Accordingly,
Defendants’ Demurrer to the fourth cause of action for unfair competition is
OVERRULED.
 
Conclusion
            
            Accordingly,
Defendants Revital Agi and Eydan Berger’s Demurrer to the Second Amended
Complaint is OVERRULED. 
 
ABR Retail, Inc.’s Demurrer to Second Amended
Complaint
 
            Defendant
ABR Retail, Inc. demurs to the second, third, fourth, eighth, and ninth causes
of action in the Second Amended Complaint.

Meet and Confer
 
Before filing a demurrer, the
demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party
who has filed the pleading subject to the demurrer and file a declaration
detailing their meet-and-confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a).)
However, an insufficient meet-and-confer process is not grounds
to overrule or sustain a demurrer.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.41(a)(4).)
 
The Declaration of Ryan Davis in
support of this motion states that counsel for the parties met and conferred
telephonically on December 11, 2023, but were unable to resolve this dispute.
(Declaration of Ryan Davis ISO Dem ¶ 2.) The Court therefore finds that
Defendants have satisfied the statutory meet-and-confer obligations. 
 
Analysis
 
            Defendant
ABR Retail, Inc. demurs to the second, third, fourth, eighth, and ninth causes
of action in the Second Amended Complaint. 
 
            After this
demurrer was filed, Plaintiff dismissed this Defendant without prejudice as to
the second, eighth, and ninth causes of action, thereby mooting this demurrer
with respect to those claims. Moreover, as to the remaining causes of action,
Defendant ABR offers the same arguments raised by Defendants Agi and Berger regarding
the fraud and unfair competition claims. Thus, for the reasons stated above, Defendant
ABR’s challenge to those claims is likewise unsuccessful.
 
Conclusion
 
            Accordingly,
Defendant ABR Retail, Inc’s Demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint is
OVERRULED as to the third and fourth causes of action and otherwise MOOT. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendants Revital Agi and Eydan Berger’s Demurrer to the Second Amended
Complaint is OVERRULED. 
 
            Defendant
ABR Retail, Inc’s Demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint is OVERRULED as to
the third and fourth causes of action and otherwise MOOT. 
 
            Moving Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
