And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the motion to stay, vacate, or transfer the case brought by the non-party US Construction Law (USCL). The Court has also denied USCL's request for sanctions against Plaintiffs' counsel. The Court has granted Plaintiffs' application for an order for sale of dwelling, and has ordered the property to be sold.

The Court's ruling is based on the fact that the issue of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction was not raised by demurrer or answer, and that USCL lacks standing to bring the motion. The Court has also found that Plaintiffs' counsel did not act in bad faith, and that USCL has not demonstrated bad faith on the part of Plaintiffs.

The Court has ordered that the property be sold, and has instructed Plaintiffs to prepare and file a proposed Order in conformance with the Court's ruling on or before May 29, 2024.
