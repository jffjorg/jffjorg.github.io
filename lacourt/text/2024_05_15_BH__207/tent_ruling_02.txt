Plaintiff Pericles Chamis




OPPOSING PARTY


Defendant Melanie Kerr



 
BACKGROUND
 
On or about November 4, 2020, Plaintiff Pericles Chamis (“Plaintiff”)
underwent an upper endoscopy procedure, during which “Plaintiff began vomiting
and convulsing on the operating table.” 
(Fifth Amended Complaint [“5AC”] ¶¶ 20, 26.)  A subsequent MRI revealed that Plaintiff
suffered a stroke, causing central visual impairment, dysphagia, and cognitive
and behavioral issues.  (5AC ¶ 32.)  
 
On October 12, 2021, Plaintiff brought suit against the surgeon,
Defendant Dale Prokupek, M.D. and Defendant Dale Prokupek, M.D., Inc.
(“Prokupek”); anesthesiologist Defendant Michelle Dinh, M.D. (“Dinh”); and Defendant
Soma Surgery Center, Inc. (“Soma”), where the endoscopy was performed, alleging
three causes of action: (1) professional negligence – medical malpractice; (2)
breach of fiduciary duty; and (3) intentional misrepresentation.
 
Dr. Prokupek’s nurse practitioner, Defendant Jeanne Hershey-Weber
(“Hershey-Weber”); the nurse who assisted during the procedure, Defendant
Melanie Kerr (“Kerr”); Dr. Prokupek’s employee Defendant Andrew Gelis
(“Gelis”); and Dr. Prokupek’s other company, Defendant Millennium Medical
Associates, Inc. (“Millennium”) were added via amendments on November 18, 2022,
as Does 1-4, respectively.  Defendant
Sean Ravaei (“Ravaei”), owner and operator of Soma, was added to the complaint
via amendment on December 1, 2022, as Doe 5.
 
On April 5, 2024, the Court granted Kerr’s motion for summary
judgment.  Judgment was entered in Kerr’s
favor on May 3, 2024.
 
Plaintiff now moves for reconsideration of the Court’s April 5, 2024
order granting summary judgment in favor of Kerr.  Kerr opposes the motion and Plaintiff replies.[1]
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1008, subdivision (a), “[w]hen an application for an order has been
made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or
granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within
10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order
and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make an
application to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the
matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order.  The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).)  Where
the statutory requirements are met, reconsideration should be granted; upon
reconsideration, however, the court may simply reaffirm its original
order.  (Corns v. Miller (1986)
181 Cal.App.3d 195, 202.)  
 
The moving party on a motion for
reconsideration “must provide not only new evidence but also a satisfactory
explanation for the failure to produce that evidence at an earlier time[.]” (Mink
v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342, internal quotations
& citations omitted; see New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005)
135 Cal.App.4th 206, 221 [on a motion for reconsideration, a party must present
new or different facts, circumstances, or law, which the moving party “could
not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered or produced” in connection with
the original hearing].)
 
JURISDICTION
 
“After entry of judgment, a trial court has no further power to rule
on a motion for reconsideration.”  (Ramon
v. Aerospace Corp. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1233, 1236.)  “Once judgment has been entered […] the court
may not reconsider it and loses its unrestricted power to change the judgment.
It may correct judicial error only through certain limited procedures such as
motions for new trial and motions to vacate the judgment.”  (Ibid.)
 
This is true even where, as here, the motion for reconsideration was
filed before judgment, but judgment was entered prior to the scheduled
hearing.  (See Safeco Insurance
Company of Illinois v. Architectural Facades Unlimited, Inc. (2005) 134
Cal.App.4th 1477.)
 
Although Plaintiff has filed the motion for reconsideration within 10
days after service of written notice of entry of the Court’s summary judgment
order, in compliance with the jurisdictional requirements of Code of Civil
Procedure section 1008, the law is clear that entry of the judgment divests the
Court of jurisdiction to hear Plaintiff’s pending motion for
reconsideration.  Once judgment has been
entered, the parties are limited to pursuing post-judgment remedies.
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
            Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration
is denied because the Court no longer has jurisdiction to rule on it.  
 
            The Clerk of the Court shall provide
notice of the Court’s ruling.
