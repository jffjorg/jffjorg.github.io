The judge's tentative ruling is based on the information presented before today. The defendant company issued various technical bulletins to its dealers concerning the transmission defect. For example, an August 2020 technical service bulletin notes that replacing transmission components or complete assemblies will not improve the condition. The defendant company also issued other technical service bulletins between 2014 and 2022. The judge's ruling is pending further evidence and will be finalized at a future court hearing.
