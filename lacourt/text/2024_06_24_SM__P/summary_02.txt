And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiffs' Motion to Set Aside Dismissal, which was unopposed. The Plaintiffs, Guerrero, et al., sued for injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident and had a series of missed court dates due to calendaring errors by their former attorney, Gilbert Moret. Despite being served, the Defendants did not appear in court on November 30, 2023, and the court dismissed the case without prejudice. The Plaintiffs timely moved to set aside the dismissal, citing CCP ยง473(b), which provides for mandatory relief from dismissal where the application for relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment and meets certain requirements. The court has granted the motion, finding that all the requirements are met and that the dismissal was entered without prejudice.
