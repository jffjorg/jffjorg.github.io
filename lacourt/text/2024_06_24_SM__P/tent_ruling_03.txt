Jensen v.
Jarmakani, et al., Case No. 24SMCV00096
Hearing date June 24,
2024
Defendants
Jarmakani’s Demurrer and Motion to Strike
Defendant Jarmakani Investment Holdings, LLC’s Demurrer
 
Plaintiff tenant
sues defendant landlords Jarmakani, individually and as trustees of the
Jarmakani Family Trust, and Jarmakani Investment Holdings, LLC for fraudulently
concealing the fact that the home he rented from defendant landlords was
subject to Santa Monica’s rent control ordinance.
 
Plaintiff leased
the property in 1993 for $2,500 per month; defendants raised the rent over the
years, and by May 2023 were charging $10,300 per month. Plaintiff alleges
defendants falsely and improperly designated the property with the City as
“owner occupied,” so the Santa Monica Rent Control Board would not send letters
to plaintiff at the property indicating the property was subject to rent
control. In December 2023 or January 2024 plaintiff discovered the property was
subject to rent control. Plaintiff alleges he was overcharged by approximately
$946,102 due to defendants’ allegedly fraudulent actions.
 
Plaintiff alleged:
violations of SMRCCA sections 1801 and 1809; negligence; fraud (intentional
misrepresentation); concealment, and unfair business practices (B&P §17200).
 
Defendants
Jarmakani individually and the LLC file substantially identical demurrers to
the fraud cause of action, which the court addresses collectively. Individual
defendants also move to strike the second cause of action as being duplicative
of the first.
 
Demurrers
“The function of a
demurrer is to test the sufficiency of the complaint as a matter of law.” Holiday
Matinee, Inc. v. Rambus, Inc. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1413, 1420. A
complaint “is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than evidentiary facts”
(Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550, but plaintiff
must set forth the essential facts of the case “with reasonable precision and
with particularity sufficient to acquaint [the] defendant with the nature,
source and extent” of the plaintiff’s claim. Doheny Park Terrace Homeowners
Assn., Inc. v. Truck Ins. Exchange (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1099. In
reviewing the legal sufficiency of a complaint against a demurrer, a court will
treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded. Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; C & H Foods Co. v. Hartford
Ins. Co. (1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 1055, 1062. 
 
“The
elements of fraud are (a) a misrepresentation (false representation,
concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) scienter or knowledge of its falsity; (c)
intent to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.”
Hinesley v. Oakshade Town Ctr. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294. 
 
Defendants argue
the FAC does not allege that defendants made a particular (mis)representation
to plaintiff, nor does it allege when, where, to whom, and by what means the
representation was tendered. 
 
Plaintiff alleges
the property was subject to rent control. FAC ¶13. He alleges in August 1993, defendants
filed a fraudulent Fee Waiver Application (FAC ¶17, 65)
which caused the City to cease sending information regarding rent control to
the property (which plaintiff would have received). FAC ¶18, 65. As a result of
defendants’ fraudulent misrepresentations, plaintiff alleges he was overcharged
rent. These allegations are sufficiently specific to establish the elements for
fraud and intentional misrepresentation. OVERRULED. Defendants to answer within
15 court days.
 
Motion to Strike
Second Cause of Action 
To the extent defendants move to strike
the second cause of action as duplicative of the first cause of action, the
motion is improperly brought. Motions to strike will only lie as to specific
allegations or prayers for relief, not entire causes of action. “[I]t is
improper for a court to strike a whole cause of action of a pleading under Code
of Civil Procedure section 436. […] While under section 436, a court at any
time may, in its discretion, strike portions of a complaint that are
irrelevant, improper, or not drawn in conformity with the law, matter that is
essential to a cause of action should not be struck and it is error to do so. [Citation.]
Where a whole cause of action is the proper subject of a pleading challenge,
the court should sustain a demurrer to the cause of action rather than grant a
motion to strike.” Quiroz v. Seventh Ave. Center (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th
1256, 1281.
 
That the cause of action may be
duplicative is immaterial. Plaintiff’s allegations are sufficient to support
both the first and second causes of action. The two causes of action state
alternative theories based on two separate statutory bases. A plaintiff is
entitled to plead alternative theories of recovery, absent some legal bar
specific to a given theory. See Blickman Turkus, LP v. MF Downtown
Sunnyvale, LLC (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 858, 889-890. DENIED.
