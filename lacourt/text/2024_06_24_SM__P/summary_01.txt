And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to stay proceedings filed by defendant Doe 1, Santa Monica-Malibu School District, in a childhood sexual abuse case. The defendant seeks to stay the proceedings for six months pending a ruling in an appellate court case, West Contra Costa Unified School District v. Contra Costa County Superior Court, regarding the constitutionality of AB 218. The judge finds that the defendant's arguments are speculative and lacks statutory or case law authority to compel a stay. The judge notes that AB 218 has withstood several prior challenges and was found constitutional in a previous case, Coats v. New Haven Unified School District (2020). The judge declines to stay the action, citing the potential prejudice to the plaintiff and the speculative nature of the defendant's arguments. The motion is denied.
