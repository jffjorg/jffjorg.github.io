Guerrero,
et al. v. Doe, et al., et al., Case No. 23SMCV02274
Hearing
date June 24, 2024
Plaintiffs’
Motion to Set Aside Dismissal (UNOPPOSED)
 
Plaintiffs
sued for injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident. The court set an initial
case management conference (CMC) and OSC re: Failure to File a Proof of Service
for September 26, 2023. See Moret Decl. ¶2. Due to a calendaring error, plaintiffs’
former attorney, Gilbert Moret, failed to appear. Id. Moret failed to
appear for two additional CMC/OSC dates on October 26 and November 30, 2023. Moret
states this was again due to calendaring errors. Id. 
 
On
November 30, 2023 there were no appearances, and defendants were not served.
The court dismissed without prejudice. 11/30/23 Minute Order. 
 
Plaintiffs
state the staff member at counsel’s office responsible for processing mail and
calendaring suffered a stroke and had lingering symptoms after returning to
work. See Moret Decl. ¶3. As a result, the CMCs/OSCs were never calendared and
led to Moret’s failure to appear. Moret learned of his failure to appear upon
receipt of the November 30, 2023 Dismissal Order. Id. Plaintiffs moved
to set aside the dismissal on May 15, 2024.
 
CCP
§473(b) provides for mandatory relief from dismissal where application for
relief is made no more than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper
form, and is accompanied by an attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. All of those requirements are
met here. 
 
Dismissal
was entered on November 30, 2023, and plaintiffs timely moved for relief based
on attorney mistake less than six months from the dismissal. Relief is mandatory
per CCP §473(b).
 
The
motion is unopposed. GRANTED.
