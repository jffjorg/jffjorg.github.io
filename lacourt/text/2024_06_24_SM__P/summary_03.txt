And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by defendants Jarmakani and Jarmakani Investment Holdings, LLC. The plaintiff, Jensen, alleges that the defendants fraudulently concealed the fact that the rental property was subject to Santa Monica's rent control ordinance, resulting in overcharges of over $946,102.

The judge has ruled that the complaint is sufficient to establish the elements of fraud and intentional misrepresentation, and has overruled the demurrer. The judge has also denied the motion to strike the second cause of action, which alleges negligence and unfair business practices, as it is not duplicative of the first cause of action.

The judge has ordered the defendants to answer the complaint within 15 court days. The ruling is subject to change after further briefing and argument.
