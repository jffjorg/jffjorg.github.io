I. BACKGROUND
 
On February 4, 2022, Plaintiffs Ying Liu; Jian Qiang Gu; Mooncali, LLC; CAXYH LLC; and Catena Partners
LLC filed this action against Defendants Peter Wang; J Baron, Inc.;
Re/Max Premier Realty/Real Estates Group; Leann Yan Li; and JL Capital
Resources, Inc. 
 
On March 16, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs
assert causes of action for: 
1.     Breach of
Contract
2.     Fraud
3.     Conversion
4.     Breach of
Fiduciary Duty
5.     Quiet Title
6.     Business and
Professions Code section 17200
7.     Penal Code
section 496(a) & (c)
Plaintiffs
allege that Defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme to steal significant
amounts of money and real property from them. Plaintiff Liu is the father of
Plaintiff Gu. Liu and Gu hired Defendant Wang in July of 2021 to represent them
in the purchase of real property located at 40825 Sierra Maria, in Murrietta,
California (Sierra Maria property). (Compl., ¶ 17.) On August 15, 2021, Gu
executed an agreement with the seller, Gary Broad (who is not a party to the
instant action), to purchase the Sierra Maria property for $5.5 million.
(Compl., ¶ 26.) Mooncali is an LLC owned by Liu and was to be the named buyer.
(Compl., ¶ 28.) Wang represented orally to Gu that there was an unwritten
understanding that the true purchase price was $6.1 million and that $600k
needed to pass to the seller “outside of escrow”. (Compl., ¶ 24.)  
Defendant Li,
whose relation to any other party in the action is not described, represented
to Liu and Gu that the $600,000 “outside escrow” payment for the Sierra Maria
property needed to be deposited with JL Capital, an entity owned by Li.
(Compl., ¶¶ 12, 31.) Liu and Gu obtained loans against their equity in three
other properties they owned to obtain the $600,000, which they deposited with
JL Capital. (Compl., ¶ 32.) Liu and Gu also deposited $530,000 with Heritage
Escrow Company to satisfy a written requirement in the sales contract for a
deposit. (Compl., ¶ 33.)  
On November
12, 2021, Wang told Gu that the sale of the Sierra Maria property needed to
close by the following Friday, or else Gu would lose all of the money
deposited, including the $530,000 deposit and the $600,000 outside-escrow
payment. (Compl., ¶ 34.) The seller of the Sierra Maria property cancelled the
sales contract on November 23, 2021, and agreed to return the initial deposit
of $530,000, less escrow fees. (Compl., ¶ 36.) However, neither Wang nor Li
told Gu or Liu that they were entitled to receive their $530,000 back. (Compl.,
¶¶ 36, 40.) Neither Gu or Liu ever received either their $530,000 deposit or their
outside-escrow $600,000 payment back. (Compl., ¶ 41.)  
On October 9,
2021, Gu and Liu hired Wang to sell a property owned by their company,
Plaintiff CAMG, in order to fund the purchase of the Sierra Maria property.
(Compl., ¶ 29.) This property is located at 22032 La Puente Road, in Walnut,
California (Walnut property). (Id.) Plaintiffs allege that Wang never
listed the property but represented that Miracle, an alleged alter ego of Wang,
wanted to buy the Walnut property. Gu and Liu sold the Walnut property to
Miracle on October 25, 2021, for $970,000. (Compl., ¶ 30.) Wang has since
occupied the Walnut property as his primary residence. (Id.)  
On November
26, 2021, Wang and Defendant Meng forged Liu’s signature on a quitclaim deed
that transferred a property previously owned by Liu to a company owned by Wang,
which is an entity named as a Defendant in the action and is called Wharton.
(Compl., ¶ 37.) That property is located at 1415 Valinda Avenue, in La Puente,
California (Valinda property). Defendant Meng was the notary for the deed and
claimed that Liu personally appeared to execute the deed, but Liu was in China
at the time. (Id.) The deed was recorded on December 1, 2021. 
In November
2022, the Court granted Defendant Wang’s motion to compel arbitration as to all
claims except the fraud and conversion claims asserted against Defendant Tuo
Meng.
On July 12, 2024, Defendant Wang filed the instant Motion for Order
Adopting Arbitrator’s Recommendation, arguing:
·       Defendant
Wang moves for an order from the Court adopting the May 8, 2024 Recommendation
issued by the Hon. Susan Cole, arbitrator for this matter.
o   On May 8, 2024, Judge Cole issued her Recommendation, denying Mr.
Barela’s motion to participate in the arbitration and ordering Claimants to
either retain new counsel or dismiss their claims in the arbitration.
o   On July 2, 2024, Judge Cole held a teleconference in the arbitration. During
this teleconference, Judge Cole advised counsel for Mr. Wang that she intended
to schedule another teleconference on July 25, 2024, and that she would like to
conduct this teleconference with a ruling from the Court on the Recommendation.

·       This Motion is made pursuant to the Court’s inherent power and
responsibility to fairly and efficiently administer the judicial proceedings
that are pending before it. (See Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 128(a)(3), (5); Hays
v. Sup. Ct., 16 Cal. 2d 260, 264 (1940).)
On August 7,
2024, the Court continued the hearing on the instant motion to allow Assignee
Dave Barela to file an opposition to the motion. 
 
On September 3, 2024, Assignee Barela filed an Opposition to Defendant’s
motion and a Memorandum as to why he was/is entitled to service of Defendant
Wang’s motion.
 
II.
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant Wang moves for an order from this Court adopting the May
8, 2024 Recommendation issued by the Hon. Susan Cole, arbitrator for this
matter. 
 
Courts have the inherent authority to
fairly and efficiently administer the judicial proceedings that are pending
before it. (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 128(a)(3), (5).) “[A] trial court has the
power to exercise a reasonable control over all proceedings connected with the
litigation before it. Such power necessarily exists as one of the inherent
powers of the court and such power should be exercised by the courts in order
to insure the orderly administration of justice.” (Hays v. Sup. Ct.
(1940) 16 Cal. 2d 260, 264.)
 
Defendant asserts that on January 12,
2024, Dave Barela appeared in this matter purporting to be an assignee of
certain claims by Claimants. (Meehan Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A at 3.) Over the next few
months, the parties submitted briefs regarding Mr. Barela’s involvement with
the arbitration and held two teleconferences. (Id., ¶ 3.) On May 8,
2024, Judge Cole issued her Recommendation, denying Mr. Barela’s motion to
participate in the arbitration and ordering Claimants to either retain new
counsel or dismiss their claims in the arbitration. (Meehan Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A
at pp. 4-8.) On July 2, 2024, Judge Cole held a teleconference
in the arbitration. (Meehan Decl., ¶ 3.) During this teleconference, Judge Cole advised counsel for Mr. Wang that
she intended to schedule another teleconference on July 25, 2024, and that she
would like to conduct this teleconference with a ruling from the Court on the
Recommendation. (Meehan Decl., ¶ 3.)
 
Mr. Barela argues that this Court
should not adopt the Arbitrator’s Recommendation and he should be allowed to
proceed in the arbitration as Plaintiffs’ assignee and real party in interest. Mr.
Barela argues this matter is still in the early stages and the only litigation that
has been conducted has been limited to getting this case to arbitration. Mr.
Barela asserts that whether Plaintiffs had assigned their claims to Mr. Barela
before a lawsuit was filed or after would not have resulted in a “practical
difference.” (Opposition, pp. 3-4.)
 
The Court does not find Mr. Barela’s
arguments persuasive or grounds to not adopt the Arbitrator’s Recommendation. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section
368.5 an action or proceeding does not abate by the transfer of an interest in
the action or proceeding or by any other transfer of an interest. The action or
proceeding may be continued in the name of the original party, or the court may
allow the person to whom the transfer is made to be substituted in the action
or proceeding. Whether to grant a request for substitution pursuant to section
368.5 is a matter of discretion. (Alameda County Home Inv. Co. v. Whitaker (1933)
217 Cal. 231, 234.) The Arbitrator’s Recommendation provided various grounds to
deny Mr. Barela’s motion to proceed in the arbitration as a real party in
interest, for example, stating in relevant part:
 
“Opposing Respondents contend that ‘[a]llowing Barela to
proceed here would result in a litigation completely different from what
Respondents agreed to when they originally submitted to arbitration.’ They are
correct… There is no express language that this is an absolute assignment… Even
assuming this qualifies as an absolute assignment (and the Arbitrator makes no
such finding) only the claims are assigned – not the contract which required
arbitration. Barela has no contractual right to arbitrate and Respondents
did not agree to arbitrate with him.” (emphasis in original)
 
“[The Arbitrator] is persuaded that allowing Mr. Barela’s
assignment would result in delay, confusion and prejudice to the proceedings.”
 
The Arbitrator acted in their discretion to deny Mr. Barela’s
request for substitution. The Court does not find any basis to not adopt the Arbitrator’s Recommendation.
 
The Court also notes that Mr. Barela filed a Memorandum as to why he was/is entitled to service of Defendant Wang’s
motion. Mr. Barela argues he should have been served with Defendant’s Motion
for Order Adopting Arbitrator’s Recommendation pursuant to Rule 1.21 because he
is an interested party. However, pursuant to the
Arbitrator’s Recommendation, the Arbitrator denied Mr. Barela’s motion to
proceed in arbitration as the real party in interest on Claimants’ direct
claims. (Meehan Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A at p. 9.)
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant Wang’s Motion for Order Adopting
Arbitrator’s Recommendation is GRANTED.
 
III. DISPOSITION
 
Defendant
Wang’s Motion for Order Adopting Arbitrator’s Recommendation is GRANTED.
