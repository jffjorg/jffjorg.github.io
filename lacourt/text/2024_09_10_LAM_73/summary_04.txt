And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to confirm an arbitration award in favor of the petitioners, Stars Collective Films Entertainment Group Inc. and William Li, against Shuang Zheng. The arbitration award was made on March 29, 2024, and the petition to confirm the award was filed on May 31, 2024. The petition includes a copy of the parties' agreement to arbitrate and the arbitration award, which determined that the petitioners' claim for breach of contract was established and awarded them liquidated damages of $5,000,000, attorney fees of $104,884.50, and costs of $25,650.92. Since the respondent did not file an opposition, the court found no reason to correct the award, vacate the award, or dismiss the proceedings. The court grants the petition to confirm the arbitration award, and the petitioners are to lodge a proposed judgment consistent with the arbitration award within 10 days.
