Here is a summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has granted Defendant Wang's motion for an order adopting the Arbitrator's Recommendation, which denies Mr. Barela's motion to participate in the arbitration as the real party in interest. The judge finds that the Arbitrator acted within their discretion in denying Mr. Barela's motion and that there is no basis to not adopt the Arbitrator's Recommendation. The judge notes that the dispute is over whether Mr. Barela is entitled to participate in the arbitration and whether the Arbitrator's Recommendation should be adopted. The judge concludes that Defendant Wang's motion is granted, and the Arbitrator's Recommendation is adopted.
