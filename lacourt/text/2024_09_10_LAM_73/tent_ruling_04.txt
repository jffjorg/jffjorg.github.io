 Case Number:  24STCP01771    Hearing Date:   September 10, 2024    Dept:  73 09/10/2024Dept. 73Hon. Rolf Treu, Judge presiding LI, et al. v. ZHENG (24STCP01771) Counsel for Petitioners/moving party:  Alex Weingarten (Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP)Counsel for Respondent:  Shuang Zheng (Pro Per) MOTION TO CONFIRM ARBITRATION AWARD (filed 06/05/2024) TENTATIVE RULING The Motion to Confirm Arbitration Award is GRANTED. I. BACKGROUND On May 31, 2024, William Li and Stars Collective Films Entertainment Group Inc. (“Petitioners”) filed a petition for an order confirming the arbitration award in favor of Petitioners and against Shuang Zheng (“Respondent”). The arbitration award in Petitioners’ favor was made on March 29, 2024, by arbitrator Barbara A. Reeves of the JAMS, related to the breach of a contract and is attached to the petition. The petition prays for confirmation of the award, judgment according to the award, attorneys’ fees, costs and post-judgment interest at the statutory rate beginning on March 29, 2024.  Respondent did not file an opposition.II. DISCUSSION “Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.)  The petition must set forth (1) the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate, (2) the names of the arbitrators, and (3) the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, or attach a copy.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.)  If such a petition is filed, the court must confirm the award unless it corrects the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the award, or dismisses the proceeding.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.) Where the petition is served but no response is served and filed, the allegations in the petition are deemed admitted.  (CCP § 1290; Taheri Law Group, A.P.C. v. Sorokurs (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 956, 962.)     Every presumption is in favor of the arbitration award. (See Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. United Rubber Workers of America (1959) 168 Cal.App.2d 444, 449.) CCP section 1286.2 provides that “the court shall vacate the award if the court determines any of the following: (1) [t]he award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means.” (CCP § 1286.2(a).) The defendant moving for vacation of an arbitration award due to corruption, fraud, or other undue means must demonstrate a nexus between the award and the alleged undue means used to attain it. (See Pour Le Bebe, Inc. v. Guess? Inc. (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 810, 833-34.) An objection to the granting of a motion to confirm an award is equivalent to a motion to vacate. (See Thriftimart, Inc. v. Superior Court (1962) 202 Cal.App.2d 421, 425-26.)  A.     Arbitration Award Here, the petition complies with Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4.  The petition includes a copy of the parties’ agreement to arbitrate.  (Ex. 1.)  Barbara A. Reeves served as the sole arbitrator.  A copy of the arbitration award is attached to the petition.  (Ex. 3.)  The arbitrator determined: “Claimants Stars Collective and William Li’s claim for breach contract, specifically breach of the Letter of Intent for Cooperation, is established. Claimants Stars Collective and William Li are awarded liquidated damages in the amount of $5,000,000. Claimants are the prevailing party, and Claimant Stars Collective is awarded attorney fees in the amount of $104,884.50 in attorney fees and $25,650.92 in costs, for a total of $130,535.42 in fees and costs.” (Ex. 4., p. 12.) Respondents have not opposed the Petition, and the Court does not have any reason to correct the award, vacate the award, or dismiss the proceedings. Based on the above, the Court determines that a confirmation of the award, as is a judgment relating thereto, to include costs and attorneys’ fees (where the arbitration award already includes costs and fees for the arbitration proceedings), and post-judgment interest at the applicable rates.  The Court GRANTS the Petition and confirms the arbitration award. III. DISPOSITION The petition to confirm arbitration award is GRANTED.  Petitioner is to lodge a proposed judgment consistent with the arbitration award within 10 days. Moving party to give notice.
