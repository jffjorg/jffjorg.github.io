```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge is considering a request from Sayda Ayala Pinto to stay the proceedings in this case until the outcome of her criminal case is determined. The judge is inclined to grant this request because the criminal case involves the same facts as this case, and Ayala's testimony could potentially incriminate her in the criminal case. The judge is also considering the interests of the parties involved, including the plaintiffs' desire to proceed with the case, and the potential prejudice to the plaintiffs of a delay. The judge will hear from Ayala at the hearing to determine whether the stay should be granted.
