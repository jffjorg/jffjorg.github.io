And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by General Motors LLC, defendant, and the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages from the complaint filed by Austin C. Crouch, plaintiff. The court has sustained the demurrer on the ground that the complaint lacks specificity, specifically failing to plead the who, what, where, when, and how required when pleading fraud. The court has denied leave to amend, as the complaint cannot be cured by amendment. The motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages is granted without leave to amend, as it rises and falls with the fraud cause of action. The parties are reminded that there is a case management conference scheduled concurrently with the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike, and the court asks counsel to make arrangements to appear remotely at the conference and hearing.
