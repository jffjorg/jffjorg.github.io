And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by the Plaintiff, Mike Korkidas, against the Defendants, Benjamin Martin Gutierrez and Beach Garden Group, LLC. The parties had entered into a stipulated judgment on March 19, 2024, which included two relevant provisions. The Defendants returned the property to the Plaintiff, but it was seriously damaged, and the Plaintiff is seeking an order awarding $45,300 (the cost to put the property back into its original condition) and attorneys' fees. The Judge has denied the motion, holding that CCP §664.6 does not permit the Court to enforce the parties' judgment by entering another judgment. The Judge also notes that there is no provision in the stipulated judgment permitting an award of monetary damages. The Judge strikes the document filed by Beach Garden Group, LLC, which purported to substitute itself into the action in pro per, and advises the Plaintiff that it is not holding that the Plaintiff lacks recourse, but rather that CCP §664.6 is not the proper recourse. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to give notice and sets a hearing date for November 5, 2024.
