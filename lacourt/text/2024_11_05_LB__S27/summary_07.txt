And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case where the plaintiff is seeking injunctive relief to stop construction operations on a subject property and return it to its pre-construction condition. However, the plaintiff has not filed proof of service of the summons, complaint, motion, or related papers on the defendant, and therefore the motion must be summarily denied. The ruling is without prejudice to the plaintiff's ability to renew the request for relief once proof of service of all papers has been filed. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative ruling must send an email to the court, and if a party does not submit on the tentative, they should make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing.
