The motion to consolidate is denied without prejudice due to the cases being pending in different departments. The motion to impose sanctions, however, is granted. The court orders the plaintiff's attorney to pay sanctions in the amount of $1500 to the court within twenty days. The defendants are ordered to give notice of the sanctions. The parties are advised to submit on the tentative ruling or appear remotely at the hearing on November 5, 2024.
