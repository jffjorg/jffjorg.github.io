And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge is considering a tentative ruling regarding a case involving a defendant who makes sales to Californians. The defendant's sales to consumers in California make up about 10% of its total sales. The court is considering applying a "sliding scale approach" to Web sites, which is distinct from the California Supreme Court's application of the approach to specific jurisdiction. The court will rely on evidence of the defendant's sales to Californians, which totals between $320,000 to $375,000 a year. The court will also consider the California Supreme Court's rejection of the "sliding scale approach" in Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior Court of California, San Francisco County (2017).
