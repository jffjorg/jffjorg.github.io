This arises from
an employment dispute. Plaintiff Lazaro Ventura Gomez (Plaintiff) alleges
causes of action for numerous Labor Code violations by his employers,
Defendants Duckmill LLC dba Berkshire House, Berkshire Restaurant and Rami
Haddad. 
            
            The
Complaint was filed on August 17, 2021. On March 16, 2022, Defendants Duckmill
LLC dba Berkshire House, Berkshire Restaurant and Rami Haddad filed a joint
answer. On August 2, 2023, the Court struck the answer of Duckmill, LLC and
Rami Haddad and entered default as to these parties. 
 
            After
denying Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment on October 9, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint against Defendants Duckmill LLC dba
Berkshire House and Rami Haddad. The FAC alleges causes of action for labor
code violations for employee misclassification, failure to pay minimum wages,
wages for all hours worked, and overtime, failure to provide accurate itemized
wage statements, failure to pay wages when employment ends, failure to pay
wages every pay period, failure to provide pay records and personnel file,
violation of labor code section 558, and unfair business practices pursuant to
California Business and Professions Code section 17200.
 
            Default
on the FAC was entered as to Defendants Duckmill LLC dba Berkshire House, and
Rami Haddad on March 26, 2024. 
 
            Plaintiff
again moved for default judgment against Defendants. Does 1-50 were dismissed. On
April 16, 2024, the request for entry of default judgment was denied. 
 
            Plaintiff
now again moves for default judgment against Defendants. The request for entry
of default judgment is granted. 
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
seeks default judgment in the amount of $65,415.18, which includes $7,351.96 (at
10%) and $1,735.58 (at 7%) in interest, $1,328.495 in costs, and $2,129.15 in
attorney fees. 
 
            Previously,
the Court raised an issue with the adequacy of Plaintiff’s rest and meal break
damages. To supplement the prior default judgment request, Plaintiff submits
evidence that he is entitled to 350 days’ worth of rest breaks ($4,200 at $12
an hour) and meal breaks ($4,200 at $12 an hour), entitling him to a total of
$8,400. (Summary of Case 5:24-6:27.) In support, Plaintiff submits evidence
that he was not given rest or meal breaks for 350 days. (4/15/24 Gomez Decl., ¶¶
3-4.)
 
Thus, Plaintiff’s rest
or meal break damages amount have been substantiated in the amount of $8,400.

 
Plaintiff also
seeks prejudgment interest starting to accrue from April 1, 2021, a month after
Plaintiff’s employment termination, based on a 10% interest rate and 7%
interest rate. (4/18/2024 Nigoghosian Decl., ¶¶ 2-5; Compl., ¶ 8.) Plaintiff’s interest calculation
of $9,087.54 is proper. 
 
Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment in the
amount of $65,415.18
is granted.
