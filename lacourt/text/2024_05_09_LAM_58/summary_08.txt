And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment for the third time, citing a lack of sufficient evidence. The court orders Plaintiff to submit a supplemental declaration including the statement of account/invoices intended to be part of Exhibit B to Mr. Lee's declaration. The court will review the supplemental declaration and determine the application. Plaintiff is ordered to file the supplemental declaration on or before May 31, 2024. A nonappearance case review is set for June 3, 2024.
