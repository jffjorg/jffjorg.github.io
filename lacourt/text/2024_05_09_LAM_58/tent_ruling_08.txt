 
            This is a
collections action. The Complaint alleges that Defendant Euphoria Textile, Inc.
(Euphoria) became indebted to Juno Textile Co., Ltd. in the amount of
$30,795.50. (Compl., ¶ 10.) Defendant Euphoria failed to pay the amounts due.
(Compl., ¶ 8.) This indebtedness claim was assigned to Plaintiff Korea Trade
Insurance Corporation (Plaintiff). (Compl., ¶ 1.)
 
Plaintiffs filed its Complaint on March
14, 2023. The Request for Entry of Default against Defendant Euphoria was
granted on May 26, 2023. Plaintiff dismissed Does 1-10. 
 
On August 16, 2023, the Court
denied Plaintiff’s initial request for entry of default judgment. On Plaintiff’s second attempt, the request for entry of
default judgment was again denied. 
 
            As set
forth below, Mr. Lee’s declaration does not include Exhibit B, the relevant
invoices. Plaintiff is ordered to submit what the Court assumes were
inadvertently not attached exhibits. The Court will then consider the request.
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            Plaintiff
requests entry of default judgment in the amount of $36,781.75, which includes
$4,193.25 in interest, $593 in costs, and $1,200 in attorney fees. 
 
The governing rule is CRC Rule 3.1800 which lays out the requirements for
default judgments. In pertinent part, the rule dictates that a party must use
form CIV-100 and file the following documents with the clerk: (1) Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; (2) Declarations or other admissible
evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) Interest computations
as necessary; (4) A memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; (6) A proposed form of judgment;
(7) A dismissal of
all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment against specified parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579,
supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) Exhibits as necessary;
and (9) A request for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the
agreement of the parties.
 
            Here, Plaintiff submits the declaration
of its Chief Representative. On this attempt for request for entry of
default judgment, Plaintiff’s declaration of Il Ho Lee, Chief Representative,
adequately addresses some the Court’s concerns. (12/15/23 Lee Decl., ¶¶ 1-5.)[1]
 
However, the declaration makes
certain representations as to the Statement of Account and/or invoices assigned,
which is purportedly attached as Exhibit B. However, no Exhibit B is identified,
and two copies of Letter of Assignment are attached. There is an exhibit with a
table containing two invoices in Exhibit A, but it is unclear whether these are
the invoices Plaintiff received from Assignor. 
 
In addition to the damages sought, Plaintiff requests interest
accruing from December 22, 2021, the date of the last payment, to May 3, 2023,
for a total of $4,193.25 in prejudgment interest. (Brodkin Interest Decl., ¶
4.) The interest rate on these invoices is proper. (Civ. Code § 3289, subd.
(b).)
 
 Plaintiff also requests attorney fees in the
amount of $1,200, which is consistent with Civil Code section 1717.5. (Brodkin Fees
Decl., ¶ 5.) The attorney fee amount requested does not exceed the amount
permitted by LASC 3.214.
 
            Rather than deny Plaintiff’s request a third time, the Court orders
Plaintiff to submit a supplemental declaration incudig the statement of
account/invoices intended to be part of Exhibit B to Mr. Lee’s declaration. The
Court will review it and determine the application.  Plaintiff is ordered to file the supplemental
declaration on or before May 31, 2024.  The
Court sets a nonappearance case review for June 3, 2024.
