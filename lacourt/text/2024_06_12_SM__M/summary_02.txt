And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court denies, without prejudice, the motion to withdraw as counsel of record for Plaintiff Marcelino Arcos. The motion is denied because the required mandatory forms were not submitted, specifically the MC-052 declaration. However, if the required forms are filed before the June 12, 2024 hearing, the court would rule that the motion to withdraw would be granted. The court is concerned that withdrawal at this late stage could impermissibly prejudice the Plaintiff. However, the counsel has provided a clear explanation of their reasonable and longstanding efforts to re-contact their client, and it is clear that counsel's withdrawal will not result in prejudice.
