Summary:
The judge's tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by the defendants, Kerri M. Hill and Kerri M. Hill, DDS, Inc., to the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Kim de la Peza, alleges that the defendants committed battery, constructive fraud, and violations of the Business and Professions Code. The judge sustains the demurrer as to the third cause of action (battery) and overrules the demurrer as to the fourth and fifth causes of action (constructive fraud and violations of Business and Professions Code, respectively). The judge finds that the plaintiff failed to plead an unconsented touching and that the defendants did not establish that the plaintiff failed to plead an unconsented touching. The judge also finds that the plaintiff pleaded the facts of a violation of law and that the defendants failed to address the fraud prong of the UCL claim.
