The judge has reviewed the declaration and is satisfied that the failures to appear were honest mistakes, not motivated by improper intent. The purpose of the sanctions was to compensate plaintiff's counsel for the fees incurred, not to punish the defendant. The court will continue the ex parte application to the next CMC scheduled for May 1, 2024. The court recommends that the parties meet and confer to resolve the dispute and recommends vacating the sanctions. The time to pay the sanctions is extended until 10 calendar days after the May 1, 2024 CMC.
