And here is the English summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling in this case is that the motion for terminating sanctions is denied in part and granted as to the alternative request to exclude admission of any opinion or testimony concerning the test in question. The motion to disqualify is denied. The application for an order nunc pro tunc is granted, as the prior order did contain a clerical error as suggested by the defendant. The court will amend the order in the manner suggested in the defendant's application filed on February 26, 2024. The court will inquire whether the sanctions were paid.

The case involves a landlord-tenant action filed by the tenant against the landlords. The plaintiff has not lived in the unit for some time due to alleged hazardous conditions, but has continued to maintain legal possession of the unit. The defendant has exclusive control of some areas of the property, including the crawlspace, which is not part of the leasehold.

The plaintiff's expert inspected the crawlspace, removing an unlocked screen and putting his head in the area. Although the expert did not enter the crawlspace, the court finds that this constitutes a technical trespass. The court denies the defense's motion for terminating sanctions, but grants the alternative request to exclude admission of any opinion or testimony concerning the test in question. The court also denies the motion to disqualify the expert and counsel.

The court notes that mediation efforts should be made, and will inquire as to third-party mediation efforts. The court also mentions that there is a trial coming up next month and advises the parties to be prepared to settle the case at the other side's last offer/demand without the need to obtain further permission.
