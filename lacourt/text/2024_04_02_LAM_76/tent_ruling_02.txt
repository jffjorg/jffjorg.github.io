COLA’s motion is also directed at excluding documents obtained from current or
former COLA employees.  The same limitations
on opinion testimony would apply to opinions contained in documents.  (See Hutton v. Brookside Hospital (1963) 213
Cal.App.2d 350, 355 (holding that contents of a document are not admissible if
they would be inadmissible via oral testimony.).)

the materials at issue are COLA documents, that carry the City seal, the
applicable hearsay analysis is more likely the official records exception,
Evidence Code section 1280, rather than the business records exception.  In this case, the distinction is not important
since other barriers to admissibility exist.
