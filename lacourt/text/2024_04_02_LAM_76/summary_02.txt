And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to exclude documents obtained from current or former COLA employees. The judge holds that the same limitations on opinion testimony would apply to opinions contained in documents. The judge also notes that the applicable hearsay analysis is more likely the official records exception, Evidence Code section 1280, rather than the business records exception. However, the judge concludes that the distinction is not important since other barriers to admissibility exist. The judge cites Hutton v. Brookside Hospital (1963) 213 Cal.App.2d 350, 355, and Evidence Code section 1280, in support of their ruling.
