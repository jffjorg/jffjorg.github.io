And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for summary judgment filed by Plaintiff Gayle Mullen against Defendants Tyler Moallem and Jonathan Redwood, Co-Administrators of the Estate of Steven A. Mullen. The dispute arises from a creditor's claim filed by Plaintiff in the probate estate matter of her ex-husband, Steven Mullen.

The Judge finds that Plaintiff's evidence is sufficient to shift her initial burden on her claim, and that the Co-Administrators have raised no triable issues of material fact to dispute Plaintiff's claim for court-ordered and unpaid child support plus interest. The Judge also finds that the settlement agreement extinguished Decedent's Watts Charges Judgment and that the Support Judgment is enforceable against the estate.

The Judge concludes that Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is granted, and within 15 days, Plaintiff is to submit a proposed judgment consistent with the Court's order.
