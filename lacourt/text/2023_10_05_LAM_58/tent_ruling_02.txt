v. Moallem
Case No.:                    22STCV36942
Matter:                        Motion for Summary
Judgment  
Moving Party:             Plaintiff Gayle Mullen


Responding
Party:      Defendants Tyler Moallem and Jonathan Redwood, Co-Administrators of
the Estate of Steven A. Mullen

 

Tentative Ruling:      The Motion for Summary Judgment is granted.   
 

 
            This dispute arises out of a creditor’s claim filed by
Plaintiff, Gayle Mullen, (Plaintiff) in the probate estate matter of her
ex-husband, Steven Mullen (Decedent). 
 
On
December 1, 2009, Plaintiff was awarded a Judgment of Dissolution in the amount
of $263,035 in child support arrearages with prejudgment interest of
$238,724.02 for a total judgment of $501,759.04 (Support Judgment). On February
17, 2022, Decedent died, and, on February 23, 2022, a Petition for Letters of
Administration was filed in case number 22STPB01715 (Probate Action).
Defendants Tyler Moallem and Jonathan Redwood (Defendants) were appointed
administrators of Decedent’s estate. On August 8, 2022, Plaintiff filed a
creditor’s claim in the Probate Action, claiming $495,289.13 was due on the
Support Judgment. On September 28, 2022, Defendants rejected Plaintiff’s
creditor’s claim in full. The Complaint contains a single cause of action for a
Rejected Creditor’s Claim pursuant to Probate Code
section 9353, subdivision (a). 
 
            On July 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for summary
judgment. Defendants opposed the motion. 

 
            The motion for summary judgment is granted. 
 
Evidentiary
Issues
 
            Plaintiff’s request for judicial notice of Exhibits A-T
is granted. (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (d).) 
 
            Defendants’ objections to the Plaintiff’s declaration are
ruled as follows: Nos. 1-6 are overruled. Defendants’ objections to the
declaration of Ryan Altomare are ruled as follows: Nos. 1-10 are overruled. 
 
            Plaintiff’s objections to Defendants’ evidence are ruled
as follows: Nos. 1-6 are sustained. 
 
Legal Standard
 
            “The
party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is
no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25
Cal.4th 826, 850.) A triable issue of material fact exists if the evidence
would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of
the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of
proof. (Ibid.) 
 
            “When
deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court must consider all of the
evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to which the court has
sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable inferences that may be drawn
from that evidence, in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary
judgment.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008)
159 Cal. App. 4th 463, 467; Code Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd. (c).)
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
moves for summary judgment on her rejected creditor’s claim on the grounds that
there are no triable issues of material fact in dispute.
 
            With an
exception not relevant here, “after the death of the decedent all money
judgments against the decedent ... are payable in the course of administration
and are not enforceable against property in the estate of the decedent under
the Enforcement of Judgments Law.” (Prob. Code, § 9300, subd. (a).) However,
such judgments must be filed “in the same manner as other claims” against a decedent’s
estate. (Prob. Code, § 9300, subd. (b); Embree v. Embree (2004) 125
Cal.App.4th 487, 493–494.) Thus, a creditor seeking payment of a judgment from
an estate must file a claim with the personal representative of the decedent’s
estate within a certain period or be barred from enforcing their claims. (Prob.
Code, §§ 9100, 9150, subd. (d).) 
 
            Upon the
filing of a claim, the personal representative must allow or reject the claim,
in whole or in part. (Prob. Code, §§ 9250, subd. (a); 9255, subd. (a).) When a
personal representative rejects a claim, in whole or in part, a creditor must
“bring an action on the claim” or the rejected part of the claim within a
specified period or the claim will be barred. (Prob. Code, §§ 9255, subd. (b),
9353, subd. (a).)
 
            Here,
Plaintiff brings an action on the rejected claim. In support, Plaintiff submits
evidence that on December 1, 2009, in Orange County Superior Court case No.
95D00841, she was awarded a judgment against Decedent for child support
arrearages and interest of $501,759.04. (PSS 7.) In that same action, Decedent
was awarded $300,574 for the fair community property rental value of the home that
Plaintiff resided in during the dissolution (Watts Charges Judgment). (PSS 10.)
Plaintiff further states that Decedent failed to make monthly child support
payments in the amount of $497, such that the Support Judgment in favor of
Plaintiff grew by $14,910. (PSS 8, 12-14.) 
 
            On November
17, 2010, Plaintiff filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7
(Bankruptcy Action). (PSS 15.) Plaintiff listed both her Support Judgment and
Decedent’s Watts Charges Judgment in her Chapter 7 filing. (PSS 17.) On March
9, 2011, David Mullem, the brother of Decedent, in his purported capacity of
Trustee for the Moallem Family Trust, filed a Proof of Claim in the Bankruptcy
Action, specifically listing the Decedent’s Watts Charges Judgment of
$300,574.00 in his Addendum to Proof of Claim, attached to the Proof of Claim.
(PSS 19.) 
 
            On April 15,
2011, Decedent and David Mullem, in his capacity as Trustee of the Trust,
entered into a Settlement Agreement and Limited Release with the bankruptcy
trustee wherein in exchange for allowing the trustee to sell the certain real
property – located at 5402 Medow Circle, Huntington Beach, CA (Property) –
through a stipulated judgment, Decedent and David Mullem would resolve their
claims against the bankruptcy estate – including the Watts Charges Judgment.
(PSS 21.) 
 
            On June 21,
2011, the trustee in the Bankruptcy Action moved the bankruptcy court for an
order, authorizing the trustee to abandon certain assets of the estate,
including the $600,000.00 Support Judgment listed in the bankruptcy filing.
(PSS 27) Thereafter, on August 8, 2011, the bankruptcy court granted the
trustee’s motion to abandon the assets listed in Schedule “B,” ordering that
the $600,000.00 Support Judgment was no longer an asset of the bankruptcy
estate. (PSS 28)
 
            On December
20, 2011, the bankruptcy court ordered that Plaintiff receive $44,420.63 as
partial payment towards her Support Judgment. (PSS 29.)
 
            Decedent
died on February 17, 2022. (PSS 34.) Letters of Administration were filed on
February 23, 2022 by Defendants on behalf of Decedent in the Los Angeles
Superior Court, under Case No. 22STPB01715 (Probate Action). (PSS 35.) 
 
            On August 8,
2022, Plaintiff filed and served a creditor's claim in the Probate Action,
claiming $495,289.13 was due on the Support Judgment to Plaintiff. (PSS 37.) On
September 28, 2022, Defendants filed a Rejection of Creditor's Claim in the
Probate Action, rejecting Plaintiff’s $495,289.13 claim in full. (PSS 38.)
 
            Plaintiff’s
evidence is sufficient to shift her initial burden on her claim on this motion
for summary judgment. 
 
            In
opposition, Defendants make a number of technical arguments that fail to address
the merits and raise no triable issue of any material fact. 
 
            First,
Defendants – citing Code of Civil Procedure section 1010 – argue the motion for
summary judgment is defective because it fails to specifically state the
judgment sought and the amount of that judgment. (Opp. 3:16-4:7.) Specifically,
Defendants state that “[t]he creditor’s claim and the complaint filed on that
rejected claim asserted that the amount of the claim is for $495,289.13.
However, the MSJ does not request that judgment is that specific amount.
Rather, it simply asks for judgment against defendants.” (Opp. 4:1-3.) 
 
            This
argument is not well-taken. The Motion for summary judgment is clear in the
relief that is sought. The motion for summary judgment, throughout, is
consistent in seeking a judgment confirming Plaintiff’s claim against
Decedent’s estate in the amount of $495,289.13. (Mot., 1:11-15, 14:24-15:1.)
This amount is consistent with the amount sought in the Complaint. (Compl., ¶¶
17-20, Prayer, ¶ 2.) Thus, the motion complies with Code of Civil Procedure
section 1010, which merely requires the notice be in writing, and the notice of
a motion, other than for a new trial, must state when, and the grounds upon
which it will be made, and the papers, if any, upon which it is to be based.”
 
            Second,
Defendants argue that the effect of the Settlement Agreement on the Watts
Charges Judgment in the Bankruptcy Action is “unclear” such that there is a
question of whether that debt against Plaintiff was discharged. In making these
arguments, Defendants do not cite any specific evidence or legal authority.
These unsupported arguments do not create triable issue of material fact. Defendants
cannot manufacture a factual dispute as to the legal effect of an agreement
where they fail to identify any specific language in the that agreement that
may have a different legal interpretation than that asserted by Plaintiff. The
absence of any analysis as to the language of the Settlement Agreement
essentially waives this argument. 
 
            In any case,
the legal effect of the bankruptcy court Settlement Agreement is unambiguous.
On March 9, 2011, David Mullem, in his capacity as Trustee of the Molallem
Family Trust, brought a Proof of Claim in the Bankruptcy Action that
specifically listed Decedent’s Watts Charges Judgment. (RJN Ex. G.) Thereafter,
the Settlement Agreement, executed on April 15, 2011 by Decedent and David
Mullem, states that:
 
“Steven Mullen, and David Mullem in
his capacity as Trustee of the Trust, expressly waive any and all claims that they
may have against the Debtor’s bankruptcy estate, including but not limited to
any proofs of claim filed or any claims arising out of the stipulated
judgment.” (RJN Ex. I, ¶ 3.2.) 
 
            Based on the
foregoing clear and unambiguous language, the Settlement Agreement – which
provided for the sale of the parties’ Property and distribution of half its
proceeds to Decedent – was intended to settle, satisfy, and extinguish
Decedent’s Watts Charges Judgment against Plaintiff. 
 
Further, Decedent’s Watts Charges
Judgment has no effect on Plaintiff’s Support Judgment:  these two judgments do not offset each other.
(See December 1, 2009 Dissolution Judgment rejecting Decedent’s request for an
offset, explaining the Support Judgment and the Watts Charges Judgment “were
two separately enforceable Judgments,” (RJN Ex. D, p. 4.) [citing Williams
v. Williams (1970) 8 Cal.App.3d 636].) Thus, even assuming the Settlement
Agreement did not extinguish the Watts Charges Judgment (which the court finds
it did), it would have no effect on the validity and enforceability of the
Support Judgment.
 
            Additionally,
Defendants argue that the Support Judgment is not enforceable as to Plaintiff
because the support obligations run to Plaintiff and Decedent’s daughter,
Victoria. However, Defendants cite no legal authority to suggest Victoria is
the real party in interest on the Support Judgment. Further, in reply,
Plaintiff cites legal authority supporting its position that the parent obligee
(or the local child support agency on the custodial parent's behalf) is the
real party in interest with standing to enforce the order and collect child
support arrearages. (County of Shasta v. Smith (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th
329, 335 [“[T]he custodial parent, not the child, has the beneficial interest
in collecting arrearages in child support.”].)
 
            Defendants also
argue that Plaintiff’s calculations as to the amount of the claim may have
errors. (Opp. 6:4-14.) Defendants argue that Plaintiff admitted to making
calculation errors and thus appears to argue that the amount in the claim
cannot be relied upon. 
 
Defendant’s speculative calculation
argument does not raise any triable issues of material fact in dispute. First,
Defendants do not identify any specific error in the calculation and do not otherwise
challenge the amount sought in the claim. Moreover, Defendants mischaracterize
the effect of Plaintiff’s admitted errors. That is, Plaintiff’s errors all
benefited Decedent’s estate by incorrectly reducing the amount Decedent owed.
(Mullen Decl., ¶¶ 18-22.) Thus, there is no triable issue of fact that
Plaintiff is owed at least $495,289.13 on her Support Judgment, which is
the amount sought in the Complaint and the motion for summary judgment.  
            
Finally, Defendants argue that the
amount of $495,289.13 on Plaintiff’s Support Judgment exceeds Decedent’s
estates assets and are therefore subject to offset pursuant to Probate Code
section 11420, subdivision (a.) This argument is a red herring. Whether the
estate is ultimately able to satisfy the judgment does not inform on
Plaintiff’s right to make a claim for amounts owed and entitlement to these
amounts. Distribution of said amounts and the priority of payments under Probate
Code section 11420 will occur in the Probate Action, but Plaintiff has met her
burden here of demonstrating entitlement to the amounts sought under Probate
Code section 9353, subdivision (a). 
 
            The Legislature
has declared the priority of child support payments in emphatic and
unmistakable terms.  “A parent’s first
and principal obligation is to support the parent’s minor children according to
the parent’s circumstances and station in life.” (Fam. Code, § 4053, subd. (a).)  The decedent failed in this obligation. Here,
his estate seeks to perpetuate that injustice.
 
            Defendants
have raised no triable issue of material fact to dispute Plaintiff’s claim for court-ordered
and unpaid child support plus interest. Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment
is granted.
 
Conclusion
 
            Plaintiff’s motion for summary
judgment is granted. Within 15 days, Plaintiff is to submit a proposed judgment
consistent with the Court’s order herein.
