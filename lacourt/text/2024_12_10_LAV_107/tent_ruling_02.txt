¿ 
I.               
BACKGROUND¿ 
 
Plaintiffs Robert
W. Brown and Patricia G. Brown (“Plaintiffs”) owned property located at 4465
Alta Tupelo Drive, Calabasas, California (the “Subject Property”). (Second
Amended Complaint [“SAC”] pp. 2, 15.) The Subject Property was sold at a
trustee’s sale on May 20, 2016. (SAC p. 2.) The Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale was
recorded with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office on May 25, 2016,
granting the Subject Property to the Bank of New York Mellon fka Bank of New
York, Trustee for the Certificateholders, CWALT, Inc. Alternative Loan Trust
2007-22 Mortgage Pass Through Certificate, Series 2007-22. (SAC p. 2.)
Plaintiffs previously filed other legal actions in federal and state court
relating to the foreclosure. (SAC pp. 6-9.)
 
On January 5,
2024, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Defendants NewRez LLC, dba
Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, NewRez LLC, fka New Penn Financial, LLC, dba
Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, New Residential Funding II, Bayview Loan
Servicing, and the Certificateholders of CWALT, Inc., Alternative Loan Trust
2007-22, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates Series 2007-22, alleging six causes
of action for unfair business practices licensing, fraud – concealment, fraud –
extrinsic, Dodd-Frank Act, unjust enrichment, and vacation. 
 
On June 4, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint against Defendants NewRez LLC, dba
Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, aka NewRez, LLC, fka New Penn Financial, LLC,
dba Shellpoint Mortgtage Servicing, New Residential Funding, II, Bayview Loan
Servicing (a California Corporation), Bayview Loan Servicing (a Limited
Liability Company), Community Loan Servicing, fka Bayview Loan Servicing (a
Delaware Limited Liability Corporation),and the Certificateholders, CWALT Inc.,
Alternative Loan Trust 2007-22, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates Series
2007-22, alleging causes of action for unfair business practices licensing,
fraud – concealment, fraud – extrinsic, Dodd-Frank Act, fraud-conveyance, and
vacate ruling.
 
On August 2, 2024, Defendants
NewRez LLC, fka New Penn Financial LLC, dba Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, New
Residential Funding, II, The Bank of New York Mellon fka The Bank of New York,
as Trustee for the Certificateholders, CWALT, Inc. Alternative Loan Trust
2007-22 Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-22 (erroneously sued as
“The Certificateholders, CWALT, Inc., Alternative Loan Trust 2007-22, Mortgage
Pass Through Certificates, Series 2007-22”) and Community Loan Servicing LLC
fka as Bayview Loan Servicing LLC (for itself and erroneously sued as “Bayview
Loan Servicing”) (“Defendants”) demurred to Plaintiffs’ first amended
complaint. On September 11, 2024, this court sustained the demurrer with leave
to amend. (09/11/24 Minute Order pp. 10-11.)
On October 25, 2024, Plaintiffs
filed a second amended complaint against 
Defendants NewRez, LLC, dba Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, NewRez LLC,
fka New Penn Financial, LLC, dba Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, New Residential
Funding II, Community Loan Servicing, fka Bayview Loan Servicing, and the
Certificateholders of CWALT, Inc., Alternative Loan Trust 2007-22, Mortgage
Pass-Through Certificates Series 2007-22, alleging three causes of action for
unfair competition and deceptive practices, wrongful foreclosure, and extrinsic
fraud. 
On November 12, 2024, Defendants
demurred to Plaintiffs’ second amended complaint. On November 25, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed an opposition. On December 3, 2024, Defendants filed a reply.
 
II.

Complaint
filed on December 5, 2022 in NewRez
LLC v. John Brosnan, et al., U.S. District
Court — Central District of California, case no. 2:22-cv08822-MWF-MAA. (Ex. G.)
8.    
Judgment
filed on September 8, 2023 in NewRez LLC v. John Brosnan, et al., U.S.
District Court — Central District of California, case no. 2:22-cv08822-MWF-MAA.
(Ex. H.)
9.    
Certificate
of Cancellation Limited Liability Company filed by Shellpoint Mortgage
Servicing LLC on April 28, 2003 in the Office of the Secretary of State of
California. (Ex. I.)
The court may take
judicial notice of “Official acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial
departments of the United States and of any state of the United States” and
“Records of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record of the
United States or of any state of the United States.” (Evid. Code
§ 452(c)-(d).)   The court may take
judicial notice of recorded deeds. (Satchmed Plaza Owners Assn. v. UWMC
Hospital Corp. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1034, 1040-1041.) Thus, this court
takes judicial notice of Exhibits A-D and G-I.
“Subdivision (c)
of Evidence code section 452 authorizes the taking of judicial notice of
‘official acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial departments of the
United States and of any state of the United States.’” (People v. Thacker (1985)
175 Cal.App.3d 594, 597.)  “However, to
be judicially noticed pursuant to subdivision (c) the matter must meet the test
of an official act.” (Id. at p. 598.) In People v. Thacker,
the Court stated “We have found no authority and none has been cited for the
proposition that materials prepared by private parties and merely on file with
state agencies may be judicially noticed pursuant to subdivision (c). (Id.)

 
The documents in Exhibits E and F appear to
be materials prepared by private parties and filed with the California
Secretary of State. Accordingly, the documents are not official acts.
 
However, the court may take judicial notice
of matters that are not reasonably subject to dispute. In Apple Inc. v.
Superior Court (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 222, 241-242, the Court of Appeal
stated that it could take judicial notice of filings with the SEC under
subdivision (h) and, although judicial notice generally “does not extend to the
truthfulness of its contents or the interpretation of statements contained
therein” there was no dispute in that case because Plaintiffs did not contest
the issue. 
 
Plaintiffs here do not oppose this court
taking judicial notice of Exhibits E and F. Thus, this court takes judicial
notice of Exhibits E and F.
 
 Plaintiffs request this court take judicial
notice of the following exhibits:
 
1.    
August 19, 2020, Grant Deed. (Ex. 1B.)
2.    
Malibu Times Proof of Publication. (Ex. 2B.)
3.    
Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale, recorded with the Los Angeles
County Recorder’s Office on May 25, 2016, as instrument number 598669. (Ex.
3B.)
4.    
Substitution of Trustee, recorded with the Los Angeles
County Recorder’s Office on November 26, 2015, as instrument number 1480611.
(Ex. 4B.)
5.    
August 19, 2020, 1098 Tax Form issued by Loan Servicer.
(Ex. 5B.)
 
Defendants do not oppose Plaintiffs’
requests for judicial notice. For the same reasons this court takes judicial
notice of Defendants’ exhibits, this court also takes judicial notice of
Plaintiffs’ exhibits.
 
III.          
PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS
 
a.     Timeliness
“A person against whom a
complaint or cross-complaint has been filed may, within 30 days after service
of the complaint or cross-complaint, demur to the complaint or
cross-complaint.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.40(a).)
 
Per California Code
of Civil Procedure §¿1005, subdivision (b), moving papers should be
filed at least 16 court days before they are set for hearing, oppositions
thereto should be filed at least nine court days before the set hearing, and
replies to any oppositions should be filed at least five court days before the
set hearing. 
 
Plaintiffs filed the second amended complaint on October 25,
2024. Defendants demurred to the second amended complaint on November 12, 2024.
Thus, the demurrer was timely filed.
 
Further, the demurrer, opposition, and reply were timely
filed under section 1005, subdivision (b).
b.     Meet and Confer
California Code of Civil Procedure section¿430.41,
subdivision (a) requires parties to “meet and confer” before the filing of a
demurrer to attempt to informally resolve the objections raised in the
demurrer.¿The demurring party is required to file and serve with the demurrer a
declaration either confirming that parties were unable to resolve the issues
raised by the demurrer despite having met and conferred or that the opposing
party failed to meet and confer with the demurring party in good faith. (Code Civ.
Proc. §¿430.41(a)(3).)
 
Defendants’ counsel submits a declaration stating they
contacted Plaintiff Robert Brown requesting a time to meet and confer and
Plaintiff Robert Brown declined to meet and confer. (Jindal Declaration ¶
4.)
 
This court finds that Defendants satisfied the meet and confer
requirement.
 
IV.          
LEGAL STANDARD¿ 
¿¿¿ 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the
pleading alone, and not the evidence or the facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc.
v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such,
the court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied
factual allegations. (Id.) The only issue a demurrer is concerned with
is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 745.)¿A complaint is sufficient if it
contains “[a]¿statement¿of the¿facts¿constituting the cause of action, in
ordinary and concise language.” (Code Civ. Proc. §¿425.10(a)(1).) Under this
standard, a “complaint ordinarily is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather
than evidentiary facts.” (Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th
531, 550.)
 
A party may demur to a complaint because the complaint “does
not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(e).) A
party may also demur because “[t]he pleading is uncertain.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(f).)
“’[U]ncertain’ includes ambiguous and unintelligible.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(f).) Demurrers for uncertainty are
strictly construed, because discovery can be used for clarification. (Khoury
v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Against a demurrer,
a plaintiff is required only to “set forth in his complaint the essential facts
of his case with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently
specific to acquaint the defendant of the nature, source, and extent of his
cause of action.” (Elder v. Pac. Bell Tel. Co. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th
841, 858.) Finally,
a party may demur to a complaint when “[t]here is a defect or misjoinder of
parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(d).)
 
V.             
DISCUSSION
 
Defendants argue the causes of action in the second amended
complaint fail to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action, are
uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible, and misjoin parties. (Notice of
Demurrer p. 2.)
 
The first page of Plaintiffs’ second amended complaint
identifies wrongful foreclosure as the second cause of action and fraud as the
third cause of action. (SAC p. 1.) However, based on the allegations in the
second amended complaint, it appears that the second cause of action is for
fraud and the third cause of action is for wrongful foreclosure. (SAC pp.
12-14.)
 
A.   
Joinder
 
Defendants argue Plaintiffs misjoin Defendants New
Residential Funding, II, Community Loan Servicing, LLC fka Bayview Loan
Servicing LLC, and The Bank of New York Mellon fka The Bank of New York, as
Trustee for the Certificateholders, CWALT, Inc. Alternative Loan Trust 2007-22
Mortgage Pass Through Certificates, Series 2007-22 (erroneously sued as “Certificateholders,
CWALT, Inc., Alternative Loan Trust 2007-22, Mortgage Pass-Through
Certificates, Series 2007-22.) (Memorandum pp. 4-5.) Defendants argue the second
amended complaint does not allege any causes of action against these Defendants
or establish any wrongdoing by them.
 
Defendants
may be joined in one action if:
 
(1)   Any
right to relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative, in respect of or
arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or
occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all these persons will
arise in the action; or
(2)   A
claim, right, or interest adverse to them in the property or controversy which
is the subject of the action.
 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 379(a).) 
 
As to the
first and third causes of actions, Plaintiffs make no specific allegations
concerning the Defendants identified above. 
 
As to the
second cause of action, Plaintiffs allege the tax identification number on the
1098 is not associated with the Bank of New York Mellon, fka the Bank of New
York, as Trustees for the Certificateholders, CWALT, Inc. Alternative Loan
Trust, 1007-22 Mortgage Pass Through Certificates, Series 2007-22 but instead
belongs to New Residential Funding II, LLC. 
(SAC p. 13.) However, Plaintiffs do not allege that those defendants
were involved in the allegations giving rise to the second cause of action.
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiffs have not alleged how these Defendants may be joined in this
action.  
 
This court
sustains the demurrer on this ground.
 
B.   
Statute of
Limitations
 
Defendants argue Plaintiffs’ causes of action are
time-barred. (Defendants’ Memorandum pp.6, 
8-9.)
 
Actions for relief based “on the ground of fraud or
mistake” are governed by a three-year statute of limitations. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 338(d).)
The cause of action accrues when the aggrieved party discovers the “facts
constituting the fraud or mistake.” (Id.) A cause of action for unfair
business practices is governed by a four-year statute of limitations. (Bus.
& Prof. Code § 17208.)
 
Relating to the fraud cause of action, Plaintiffs allege that
Defendant “NewRez, LLC d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, LLC prepared a 1098
and 1099-C IRS Tax forms at the close of the resale escrow on August 19, 2020”
of the Subject Property. (SAC p. 13.) Plaintiffs do not allege they discovered
the facts constituting this cause of action at a later date. Thus, Plaintiffs
had until August 19, 2023, to file this cause of action. 
 
Similarly, relating to the wrongful foreclosure cause of
action, Plaintiffs allege the trustee’s sale took place on May 20, 2016. (SAC
pp. 2, 14.) Plaintiffs, therefore, had until May 20, 2019, to file the third
cause of action. 
 
Plaintiffs filed the complaint on January 5, 2024.
Accordingly, the wrongful foreclosure and fraud causes of action are
time-barred.
 
As to the unfair business practices cause of action,
Defendants argue that “Plaintiffs complain about the 2016 foreclosure sale” but
“in any event, any claim to unwind or challenge the 2016 sale is time-barred.”
(Memorandum p. 6.) However, Plaintiffs allege that a grant deed was recorded
with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office on August 19, 2020, “reflecting
NewRez, LLC, f/k/a New Penn Financial, LLC, dba Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing,
a Limited Liability Company executing said document as ‘Attorney in Fact’ for
CWALT 07-22” and “[t]he Plaintiffs, who were still occupying the property in
question at the time, were given no notice of their home having being sold. In
fact, it was not until the Plaintiffs received a 1098 IRS tax form from the
Defendants did the Plaintiffs learn they were homeless. (SAC p. 11.) Based on
these allegations, it appears that Plaintiffs’ unfair business practice cause
of action accrued on August 19, 2020. Four years after August 19, 2020, is
August 19, 2024. Thus, Plaintiffs’ unfair business practices cause of action is
not time barred.
 
C.   
Causes of Action
 
i.                
Unfair Business
Practices
 
Defendants argue Plaintiffs fail to state a cause of action
for unfair business practices because: (1) NewRez LLC is licensed to do
business in California, (2) NewRez LLC dba Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing is not
the same entity as Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing LLC; (3) Plaintiffs lack
standing to assert a UCL claim; and (4) Plaintiffs fail to allege wrongful
conduct under the UCL. (Memorandum pp. 5-7.)
 
A.   
NewRez LLC’s
Licensing Status and ShellPoint Mortgage Servicing LLC
 
Defendants cite Exhibits E and F to show that NewRez LLC is
licensed to do business in California. (Memorandum p. 5.) Although this court
took judicial notice of those exhibits, “[t]aking judicial notice of a document
is not the same as accepting the truth of its contents or accepting a
particular interpretation of its meaning.” (Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont
General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 113.) Further, “[a] demurrer is
simply not the appropriate procedure for determining the truth of disputed
facts.” (Id.) Whether NewRez LLC is licensed in California is a disputed
fact. (Memorandum p. 5; SAC p. 12.)
 
Accordingly, this court declines to sustain the demurrer on
that basis. For the same reasons, this court declines to sustain the demurrer
on the basis that ShellPoint Mortgage Servicing is not the same entity as
ShellPoint Mortgage Servicing LLC. 
 
B.   
Standing
 
Defendants argue Plaintiffs lack standing to assert a UCL
claim because they allege no injury or causation. (Memorandum pp. 5-7.)
Defendants further argue Plaintiffs fail to allege any wrongful conduct under
the UCL. (Memorandum pp. 5-7.)
 
Unfair competition is defined as “any unlawful, unfair or
fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading
advertising and any act prohibited by Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 17500)
of Part 3 of Division 7 of the Business and Professions Code.” (Cal. Bus. &
Prof. Code § 17200.) “Under its ‘unlawful’ prong, ‘the UCL borrows violations
of other laws . . . and makes those unlawful practices actionable under the
UCL.’” (Berryman v. Merit Property Management, Inc. (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th
1544, 1554.)
 
To have standing under Section 17204, a plaintiff must have
“lost money or property.” (Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court (2011) 51
Cal.4th 310, 323, superseded by statute on other grounds in Citizens of
Humanity, LLC v. Hass (2020) 46 Cal.App.589, 595 fn. 2.) The “plaintiff’s
economic injury [must] come ‘as a result of’ the unfair competition or a
violation of the false advertising law.” (Id.) “The phrase ‘as a result
of’ in its plain and ordinary sense means ‘caused by’ and requires a showing of
a causal connection or reliance on the alleged misrepresentation.” (Id.)
The causation prong is not satisfied “when a complaining party would suffer the
same harm whether or not a defendant complied with the law.” (Daro v.
Superior Court (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1079, 1099.)
 
Plaintiffs allege that NewRez, LLC fka New Penn Financial,
LLC dba Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, “an unlicensed servicing company
executed a conveyance document . . .” (SAC p. 11.) Plaintiffs further allege
that:
 
To what extent
NewRez, LLC f/k/a New Penn Financial, LLC, d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing,
LLC and NewRez LLC, d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, LLC role as an
unlicensed loan servicer in a concealed escrow from the Plaintiffs of their
home, beyond executing the conveyance document. What is known is the Plaintiffs
ended up homeless by a sheriff eviction and the new owner damaging or disposing
of over half of the Plaintiffs personal property. All caused by an unlicensed
Defendant conducting unfair and deceitful business practices, along with
engaging in prohibited valid contracts . . .” 
 
(Complaint p. 12.) 
 
Although Plaintiffs allege an “unlicensed Defendant” caused
Plaintiffs to be evicted, Plaintiffs do not allege that it was that Defendant’s
failure to be licensed that caused Plaintiffs’ eviction. Accordingly,
Plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts showing the causation element.
This court sustains the demurrer as to Plaintiffs’ unfair business practices
cause of action.
 
ii.              
Wrongful
Foreclosure
 
The elements of a wrongful foreclosure cause of action are:
 

[T]he
     trustee or mortgagee caused an illegal, fraudulent, or willfully
     oppressive sale of real property pursuant to a power of sale in a mortgage
     or deed of trust; 
[T]he
     party attacking the sale (usually but not always the trustor or mortgagor)
     was prejudiced or harmed; and 
[I]n
     cases where the trustor or mortgagor challenges the sale, the trustor or
     mortgagor tendered the amount of the secured indebtedness or was excused
     from tendering.

 
(Miles
v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 394, 408.)
 
Plaintiffs
allege there was a wrongful foreclosure because the notice was published in the
Malibu Times, while the Subject Property is in Calabasas. (SAC pp. 14-15.)
Plaintiffs further allege the Subject Property was sold 60 miles away in
Pomona. (SAC p. 15.)
 
The 2016
version of Civil Code section 2924f, subdivision (b)(1) stated:
 
Except as provided in subdivision (c), before any sale of
property can be made under the power of sale contained in any deed of trust or
mortgage, or any resale resulting from a rescission for a failure of
consideration pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section
2924h, notice of the sale thereof shall be given by posting a written
notice of the time of sale and of the street address and the specific place at
the street address where the sale will be held, and describing the property to
be sold, at least 20 days before the date of sale in one public place in the
city where the property is to be sold, if the property is to be sold in a city,
or, if not, then in one public place in the judicial district in which the
property is to be sold, and publishing a copy once a week for three consecutive
calendar weeks.
 
Plaintiffs allege
the notice of sale was published in Malibu, but do not allege that Malibu is
not within the judicial district where the property was to be sold. (SAC pp.
14-15.)
 
Under the
2016 version of Civil Code section 2924g, subdivision (a), “All sales of
property under the power of sale contained in any deed of trust or mortgage
shall be held in the county where the property or some part thereof is
situated, and shall be made at auction, to the highest bidder, between the
hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on any business day, Monday through Friday.”
 
Plaintiffs
alleges the sale took place 60 miles away “outside of the Plaintiff’s property
city limits and judicial district”, but do not allege that Pomona, CA is not
part of Los Angeles County. (SAC pp. 14-15.)
 
Plaintiffs
have not alleged there was an illegal, fraudulent, or willfully oppressive
sale, and have therefore not stated a cause of action for wrongful foreclosure.
 
iii.            
Fraud – Extrinsic
 
The elements of
fraud are: (1) a misrepresentation; (2) knowledge of falsity; (3) intent to
defraud; (4) justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting damage. (Beckwith v.
Dahl (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 1039, 1060.) Fraud elements must be alleged
with particularity. (Id.) 
 
Plaintiffs allege “a 1098 IRS Tax Form prepared by New Rez,
LLC, d/b/a Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, LLC, on August 19, 2020, declaring an
acquisition of February 1, 2020, with a Tax Identification Number not connected
to the preparer or the purported lender of record, but to a subsidiary” and
“Defendants purchased the Plaintiffs note and deed of trust as an act of
deception or misrepresentation.” (SAC pp. 13-14.)
 
Even if this court interpreted the 1098’s containing the
subsidiary’s tax identification number as satisfying the misrepresentation
element, Plaintiffs have not alleged with specificity the knowledge of falsity,
intent to defraud, or justifiable reliance elements.
 
Thus, Plaintiffs have not alleged a cause of action for
fraud.
 
D.   
Uncertain
 
Defendants argue all of Plaintiffs’ causes of action fail
because they are uncertain and ambiguous. (Memorandum p. 10.)
 
This
court agrees that the second amended complaint is uncertain as to Defendants New Residential Funding, II, Community Loan
Servicing, LLC fka Bayview Loan Servicing LLC, and The Bank of New York Mellon
fka The Bank of New York, as Trustee for the Certificateholders, CWALT, Inc.
Alternative Loan Trust 2007-22 Mortgage Pass Through Certificates, Series
2007-22 (erroneously sued as “Certificateholders, CWALT, Inc.,
Alternative Loan Trust 2007-22, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series
2007-22.) It is unclear which, if any, causes of action are asserted against
those Defendants or what damages Plaintiffs are seeking from those Defendants.
 
This court further finds that the remaining causes of action
and allegations are sufficient to acquaint Defendant NewRez with the nature,
source, and extent of the causes of action.
 
VI.          
LEAVE TO AMEND
 
“A plaintiff
against whom a demurrer is sustained is entitled to leave to amend the
defective complaint if she can ‘prove a reasonable possibility that the defect
can be cured by amendment.’” (Shaeffer v. Califia Farms, LLC (2020) 44
Cal.App.5th 1125, 1145.) “The onus is on the plaintiff to articulate the
‘specific ways’ to cure the identified defect, and absent such an articulation,
a trial . . . court may grant leave to amend ‘only if a potentially effective
amendment is both apparent and consistent with the plaintiff’s theory of the
case.’” (Id.) When a Plaintiff fails to describe “what additional facts
she would plead . . . she has not satisfied her burden of showing that she can
amend the complaint to cure its defects.” (Mohler v. County of Santa Clara
(2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 418, 428.) 
 
This court finds that there
is a reasonable possibility Plaintiffs can successfully amend the complaint as
to Plaintiffs’ cause of action for unfair business practices and grants
Plaintiffs leave to amend that cause of action.
 
Plaintiffs’ causes of action
for wrongful foreclosure and fraud are time barred, Plaintiffs offer no
additional facts suggesting they can successfully amend those causes of action,
and this court finds there is no reasonable possibility the defects can be
cured by amendment. Thus, this court sustains the demurrer as to the wrongful
foreclosure and fraud causes of action without leave to amend.
 
VII.        
CONCLUSION 
 
For the foregoing reasons, this court sustains the demurrer
and grants Plaintiffs leave to amend their cause of action for unfair business
practices. This court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend as to the
causes of action for wrongful foreclosure and fraud.
