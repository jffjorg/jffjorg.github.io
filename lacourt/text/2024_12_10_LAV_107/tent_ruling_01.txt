COURT’S
  [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
 
Motion
  to Reconsider 



 
[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: 
 
Deny
 
I.               
BACKGROUND
 
On
November 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Horizons Senior Apts,
Cirrus Asset Management, and Does 1 to 10, alleging a single “Intentional Tort”
cause of action. (Complaint p. 5.)  
 
On
June 6, 2024, Defendants 26705 Malibu Hills Road LLC (erroneously sued as
Horizons Senior Apts) (“Malibu Hills”) and Cirrus Management, Inc. demurred to
Plaintiff’s complaint. (Demurrer filed 06/6/24.) This court sustained the
demurrer with leave to amend. (07/15/24 Minute Order pp. 5-6.)  
 
On
August 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint. (First Amended
Complaint, “FAC” p. 1.) Plaintiff’s first amended complaint added Defendants
Gary Fidler, Debbie Lush, Greg Meyers, Steve Heimler, Shirin Shojapour, Elliot
Hakakzedah, Manisha K. Bajaj, and Cynthia Gutierrez. (FAC p. 2.) The first
amended complaint also added various causes of action. (FAC pp. 4-16, 18, 32.)
 
On
September 11, 2024, Defendants Malibu Hills, Cirrus Asset Management, Inc.,
Cynthia Gutierrez, and Greg Meyers demurred to Plaintiff’s first amended
complaint. 
 
On
October 16, 2024, this court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.
(10/16/24 Minute Order p. 10.)
 
On
November 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a “Motion for rehearing of 10/16/2024
defendant’s demurrer and motion to strike declaration”, a “Motion for
reconsideration of October 16, 2024 declaration and attachments”, and an
“Opposition to strike squash eliminate defendants demurrer and motion to strike
with declaration.” 
 
On
November 20, 2024, Defendants Malibu Hills and Cirrus Asset Management
(“Defendants”) filed an opposition. Plaintiff filed another declaration on
November 26, 2024, but did not file a reply to Defendants’ opposition.
 
II.            
SERVICE
 
Defendants state Plaintiff failed
to serve these motions to Defendants and “[a]ccordingly, Defendants are
left to speculate as to what, exactly, is in the Motions, because
Plaintiff has refused to serve them, and the Motions are unavailable to
download from the Court’s website.” (Opposition p. 4.) Defendants also state
that “[b]ecause Plaintiff has consistently refused to properly serve her
pleadings and filings, Defendants’ counsel, on a daily basis, reviews the
Court’s website to ascertain whether Plaintiff has filed anything with the
Court.” (Opposition p. 6.)
 
Defendants submit emails showing
Defendants’ counsel repeatedly asked Plaintiff to serve Defendants with the
motions. (Exs. C, D, E.)  Plaintiff
responded to one of Defendants’ counsel’s emails, stating: “It's inherent
you're aware I filed, and aware of what I've filed.” (Ex. E pdf p. 65.)
 
California Rule of Court rule
3.1300 states that: “Unless otherwise ordered or specifically provided by law,
all moving and supporting papers must be served and filed in accordance
with Code of Civil Procedure section 1005 and, when applicable, the statutes
and rules providing for electronic filing and service.” (Emphasis added.)
Moreover, “[u]nless otherwise ordered or specifically provided by law, all
moving and supporting papers shall be served and filed at least 16 court
days before the hearing.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005(b) (Emphasis added).)
 
Service is mandatory. It is not
“inherent” that Defendants are aware of what Plaintiff files.
 
III.          
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“When
an application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused
in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any
party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of
written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made
the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order. The party making the application shall state by affidavit what
application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions
were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed
to be shown.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008(a).) 
 
“Section
1008, subdivision (a) requires that a motion for reconsideration be based on
new or different facts, circumstances, or law. A party seeking reconsideration
also must provide a satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce the
evidence at an earlier time.” (New York
Times Co. v. Superior Court¿(2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212.) “The burden
under section 1008 is comparable to that of a party seeking a new trial on the
ground of newly discovered evidence: the information must be such that the moving
party could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered or produced it at
the trial.” (Id. at pp. 212-213.)
 
“A
motion to reconsider is not valid if it is filed after the final judgment is
signed.” (Branner v. Regents of
University of California (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1043, 1048.)
 
IV.          
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff filed three motions: (1)
a “Motion for rehearing of 10/16/2024 defendant’s demurrer and motion to strike
declaration” (“Rehearing Motion”); (2) a “Motion for reconsideration of October
16, 2024 declaration and attachments” (“Motion for Reconsideration”), and (3)
an “Opposition to strike squash eliminate defendants demurrer and motion to
strike with declaration” (“Opposition Motion.”) 
 
All three motions request this
court reconsider its ruling on Defendants’ demurrer. (Opposition Motion p. 1;
Motion for Reconsideration p. 1; Motion for Rehearing Declaration pdf p. 3.)
Accordingly, this court treats all the motions like motions for reconsideration
under section 1008. (See J.W. Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New
York, Inc. (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 1142, 1171 [“The name of a motion is not
controlling, and, regardless of the name, a motion asking the trial court to
decide the same matter previously ruled on is a motion for reconsideration
under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008.”]) 
 

Made
     and Decided Before Entry of Judgment

 
A
motion for reconsideration must be filed before the court enters its final
judgment. (See Branner v. Regents of
University of California, supra, 175 Cal.App.4th at p. 1048.)
 
The
court has not entered a final judgment in this case. Thus, this requirement is
satisfied.
 

Brought
     Before the Same Judge

 
A
motion for reconsideration must be brought before “the same judge or court that
made the order[.]” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008(a).) 
 
This
court issued the order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend. Thus,
this requirement is satisfied.
 

Timeliness

 
A
motion for reconsideration must be filed within ten days after service upon the
party of the court’s order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008(a).) Service by mail
to a California address extends the “period of notice and any right or duty to
do any act . . . [by] five calendar days.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1013(a).)
 
This court entered its order
sustaining the demurrer on October 16, 2024. (10/16/24 Minute Order.) The clerk
mailed the Minute Order to Plaintiff that same day. (Certificate of Mailing
filed 10/16/24.) Ten days after October 16, 2024, is October 26, 2024. Five
calendar days after October 26, 2024, is November 1, 2024. Plaintiff filed the
motions on November 5, 2024.
 
Thus,
Plaintiff’s motions are untimely.
 

New
     or Different Facts, Circumstances, or Law

 
A
motion for reconsideration must be based on “new or different facts,
circumstances, or law[.]” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008(a).) 
 
Plaintiff
argues there was no good faith effort to meet and confer. (Opposition Motion
pp. 2-4; Motion for Reconsideration pp. 4-5; Motion for Rehearing p. 2.)
Plaintiff also attaches documents to the Motion for Reconsideration including:
(1) a quote; (2) a letter about Plaintiff’s lease renewal; (3) two 60-day
notices to terminate tenancy; (4) a 60-day notice of change in terms of
tenancy; and (5) two letters from Defendant Horizons at Calabasas’ counsel to
Plaintiff. (Motion for Reconsideration pdf p. 11-25.) To the Motion for
Rehearing, Plaintiff attaches: (1) a copy of 1010.6 regarding electronic
service; (2) Rule 3.3 of the California Rules of Professional Conduct requiring
candor toward the tribunal; and (3) Rule 7.1 of the California Rules of Professional
Conduct regarding communication concerning a lawyer’s services. (Rehearing
Motion pp. 6-8.)
Also,
in the Motion for Reconsideration Plaintiff states: “More attachments may be
forthcoming in next few days…” (Rehearing Motion p. 5.) Plaintiff filed another
declaration on 11/26/24 with more exhibits showing broken car windows
 
 
 
Plaintiff
raised the meet and confer argument in her untimely opposition to Defendants’
demurrer. (Opposition to Demurrer filed 10/7/24 p. 1.) This court did not
consider Plaintiff’s opposition because it was untimely. (10/16/24 Minute Order
pp. 2-3.) The court also stated in that order that “the court finds that the
Plaintiff has had ample time to file an opposition but instead chose to spend
her time on other, less time sensitive matters, and that requests for
continuances were an attempt to further delay matters and not out of necessity.”
(10/16/24 Minute Order p. 3.) Further, in its October 16, 2024, Minute Order,
this court found Defendants satisfied the meet and confer requirement.
(10/16/24 Minute Order p. 3.) Moreover, even if this court had determined the
meet and confer process was insufficient, “[a] determination by the court that
the meet and confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule
or sustain a demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(4).) 
 
Plaintiff’s
meet and confer argument is meritless.
 
Next,
Plaintiff states she was ill in September and October 2024, and references
leaking gas lamps. (Opposition Motion p. 1; Motion for Reconsideration p. 1;
Rehearing Motion p. 1.) 
 
On October 14, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a declaration stating she had health issues in September and October. (Ex
Parte Application for Extension filed 10/14/24 p. 3.) Further, at the hearing
on October 15, 2024, Plaintiff stated she was sick and referenced the gas
lamps. (Defendants’ Opposition Ex. A Transcript 10:21-11:7; 11:16-17.) This
court responded that Plaintiff had not submitted corroborating evidence.
(Defendants’ Opposition Ex. A Transcript 12:13-18.) The court also stated, “I
think that in the declarations that you’ve submitted previously you’ve just
kind of in a conclusory fashion said you’ve had health issues, and those health
issues have not kept you from doing some things, and you haven’t had the
alleged health issues, by your own admission, for long stretches of time where
you could have been opposing the demurrer.” (Defendants’ Opposition Ex. A
Transcript 12:21-28.)  Plaintiff was
aware of her health issues in October 2024 and raised them to this court before
it made its ruling on Defendants’ demurrer. Plaintiff’s health problems do not
constitute new facts, circumstances, or law.
 
Moreover, to the extent Plaintiff
raises heath issues that may not have been produced to this court before this
court’s ruling on Defendants’ demurrer, such as insect bites, Plaintiff offers
no satisfactory explanation for why she failed to produce this evidence at an
earlier time. (Motion for Reconsideration p. 4.) (See New York Times Co. v.
Superior Court, supra, 135 Cal.App.4th at p. 212.) Moreover, to the extent
Plaintiff may cite her health problems as an explanation for her failure to
bring these issues to this court’s attention, this court finds Plaintiff’s
health issues are an insufficient explanation because Plaintiff actively filed
motions with this court – including multiple ex parte motions – and appeared
for hearings on those motions. (See e.g., 11/5/24 Minute Order, Hearing on Ex
Parte Application Motion to oppose strike squash eliminate defendants demurrer
and motion to strike with declaration; Hearing on Ex Parte Application Motion
for rehearing of 10/16/2024 Defendants demurrer and motion to strike
declaration; 10/15/24 Minute Order, Hearing on Ex Parte Application Application
for extension of time to serve pleading and orders.) 
 
V.             
CONCLUSION
 
For the foregoing
reasons, this court denies Plaintiff’s motions.
