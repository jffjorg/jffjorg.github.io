[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
PETITION TO APPROVE MINOR’S COMPROMISE OF
  PENDING ACTION
 




            
Background
On September 27, 2023,
Plaintiffs Candy Mejia, Melissa Hernandez, and Walter Mansilla, a minor by and
through his Guardian ad Litem Candy Mejia filed this action against Defendants
4840 Rosewood, LLC and Behzad Ben Beroukhai, individually and as Trustee of the
2007 Behzad Beroukhai Revokable Trust. The Complaint alleges causes of action
for (1) tortious breach of warranty of habitability, (2) breach of covenant of
quiet enjoyment, (3) nuisance (negligence), (4) negligent infliction of
emotional distress, (5) negligent maintenance of the premises, (6) nuisance
(intentional tort), and (7) intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
The parties have
reached a settlement in this matter.
Candy Mejia as Petitioner
for Claimant Walter Mansilla
(“Petitioner”) now petitions for the Court’s
approval of the settlement on behalf of the Claimant.   
            Discussion
An enforceable settlement of a minor’s claim can only be consummated
with court approval. (Prob. Code, § 3500.) “A
petition for court approval of a compromise of, or a covenant not to sue or
enforce judgment, on a minor’s disputed claim; a compromise or settlement of a
pending action or proceeding to which a minor or person with a disability is a
party; or the disposition of the proceeds of a judgment for a minor or person
with a disability under Probate Code sections 3500 and
3600-3613 or Code of Civil Procedure section 372
must be verified by the petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all
information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise,
covenant, settlement, or disposition. Except as provided in rule 7.950.5, the petition must be submitted on a
completed Petition for Approval of
Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for
Minor or Person With a Disability (form MC-350).” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950, emphasis in
original.)  
Here, the petition is prepared on forms
MC-350 and is verified by Petitioner. The Court
finds that the settlement is reasonable. However, the Court notes that although Item 11(b)(5) of the Petition
(Form MC-350) provides that “[a]dditional plaintiffs or claimants and amounts
are listed on Attachment 11b(5),” no Attachment 11b(5) appears to have been
provided.
            Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the Court intends to grant the
petition and approve the compromise, subject to Petitioner correcting the
defect identified above, and subject to Plaintiffs’ examination of Petitioner
at the hearing.¿¿ 
Petitioner is ordered to give notice of this Order.
