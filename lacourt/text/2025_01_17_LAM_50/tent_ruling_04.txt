[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT
 




            
Plaintiff Woori America Bank (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of default
judgment against Defendant Hwa Ok Yang. Plaintiff seeks judgment in the total
amount of $46,110.24, comprising $37,931.89 in damages, $2,828.24 in interest,
$3,737.31 in costs, and $1,612.80 in attorney’s fees. 
The Court notes one defect with the submitted default judgment
package. Plaintiff appears to utilize a 360-day period as part of its interest
computations. (See Han Decl., ¶ 24.) However, in David S. Karton, A Law Corp. v. Dougherty (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 133, 138, footnote 1, the Court of
Appeal noted as follows: 
 
“Karton’s interest calculation
contains an additional anomaly. The interest column of the spreadsheet bears
the following heading: “Interest (10%/360 dy).” Karton’s declaration says
nothing about what that means, but a separate declaration by Karton’s counsel,
filed on the same day and attaching the same spreadsheet, contains the
following somewhat opaque explanation: The interest “is computed by charging
10% per annum simple interest on the outstanding balance at the end of each
month” and then “dividing said 10% by a 360-day year which is the same
procedure [used] by the Los Angeles Superior Court in computing interest.” The
declaration cites no authority for the claim that the superior court calculates
interest on the basis of a 360-day year. In any event, Karton and his counsel
purported to be calculating interest due under a private contract (i.e., the
retainer agreement) that provided for “simple interest at the rate of ten
percent (10%) per annum.” In 1976, the Supreme Court held that “quoting
interest calculated on the basis of a 360-day year as ‘per annum’ constituted a
violation of Business and Professions Code section
17500.” (Fletcher v. Security Pacific National
Bank (1979) 23 Cal.3d 442, 454 [153 Cal. Rptr. 28, 591 P.2d 51];
see Chern v. Bank of America (1976) 15
Cal.3d 866, 876 [127 Cal. Rptr. 110, 544 P.2d 1310] [“‘Per annum’ means
literally ‘by the year.’ [Citations.] As commonly understood, a year has either
365 or 366 days. [Citation.] In the absence of evidence to the
contrary, we must assume that the public is likely to understand that a ‘per
annum’ rate is an annual rate based on a 365-day calendar year.”].).”
Plaintiff does not appear to provide any legal authority demonstrating
that its calculation of interest on the basis of a 360-day year is
appropriate.  
Based on the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request for
default judgment without prejudice. The Court will discuss with Plaintiff a
schedule for resubmission of the default judgment package.
