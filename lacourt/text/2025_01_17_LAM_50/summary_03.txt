And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the petition to approve the minor's compromise of the pending action and has found that the settlement is reasonable. However, the petition is incomplete due to missing information, specifically Attachment 11b(5). The judge intends to grant the petition and approve the compromise, but only if the petitioner corrects the defect and presents the required information at the hearing. The judge also orders the petitioner to give notice of this order.
