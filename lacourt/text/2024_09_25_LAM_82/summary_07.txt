```
Case Number: 24STCP02773
Case Name: Plated Personal Chef Services Ltd. vs. City of Los Angeles et al.
Healing Date: September 25, 2024
Department: 82
Plaintiff: Plated Personal Chef Services Ltd.
Defendant: City of Los Angeles et al.
Judge: Stephen I. Goorvitch

Summary:
The judge denies the plaintiff's application for a preliminary injunction to stop the City of Los Angeles from converting a parking lot into a temporary, affordable housing project.

Facts:
* The City of Los Angeles acquired the parking lot through eminent domain in 1990.
* The plaintiff, Plated Personal Chef Services Ltd., operates a restaurant in the area and relies on the parking lot for its customers.
* The City plans to convert the parking lot into a temporary, affordable housing project to address the city's homelessness crisis.
* The plaintiff argues that the City failed to follow the proper procedure for changing the use of the property and seeks a preliminary injunction to stop the project.

Issues:
* Whether the plaintiff has standing to challenge the City's decision to convert the parking lot.
* Whether the plaintiff has a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits.
* Whether the balance of harms favors the plaintiff's position.

Holding:
* The judge finds that the plaintiff lacks standing to challenge the City's decision because it does not have a beneficial interest in the property.
* The judge finds that the plaintiff has not demonstrated a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits because the City has followed the proper procedure for changing the use of the property.
* The judge finds that the balance of harms favors the City's position because the City has a compelling interest in addressing the city's homelessness crisis and has already incurred costs in preparing the project.

Order:
* The court denies the plaintiff's application for a preliminary injunction.
* The court dissolves the temporary restraining order and discharges the order to show cause why a preliminary injunction shall not issue.
