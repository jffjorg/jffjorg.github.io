[Tentative] Order Denying
Application for Preliminary Injunction
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
            Plated
Personal Chef Services Ltd. (“Petitioner”) operates a restaurant, the Saucy
Bird, located on Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles, California.  According to Petitioner, the parking lot across
the street—which is located at 2377 Midvale Avenue (“Lot 707”)—is “the only
public, off-street parking available for the businesses on the stretch of Pico
Boulevard near the Lot.”  (Motion for
Preliminary Injunction filed September 9, 2024 (“Mot.”) 3.)  The City originally
acquired Lot 707 by eminent domain in 1990 for the purpose of establishing a
public off-street parking lot.  More
recently, however, the City of Los Angeles and the City Council (collectively,
the “City” or “Respondents”) authorized Lot 707 to be used for affordable
housing and commenced construction of that project in August 2024.  The court (Kin, J.) previously granted an ex
parte application for a temporary restraining order and set an order to show
cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue.  Petitioner seeks a mandatory injunction
directing the City “to restore” Lot 707 to its prior use.  
 
Petitioner seeks a mandatory injunction pending trial in this
matter.  “The granting of a mandatory
injunction pending trial is not permitted except in extreme cases
where the right thereto is clearly established.”  (Teachers Ins. & Annuity Ass’n v. Furlotti (1999)
70 Cal.App.4th 1487, 1493.)  “A preliminary
mandatory injunction is rarely granted….” (Board of Supervisors v. McMahon
(1990) 219 Cal. App.3d 286, 295.) 
Petitioner does not satisfy this standard for three independent
reasons.  First, the statute upon which
Petitioner relies—Code of Civil Procedure section 1245.245—applies to property acquired by eminent domain after January 1,
2007, and this property was seized before that date.  Second, even if section 1245.245 applies
retroactively, Petitioner lacks standing to file an action under section
1245.245.  Finally, even if section
1245.245 applies retroactively, and even if Petitioner has standing, the court
cannot issue a writ directing the City to exercise its discretion in a
particular way, so the court does not have authority to issue the requested
preliminary injunction.  To the extent
the court must consider the balance of harms, that analysis favors the
City.  Therefore, the court dissolves the
temporary restraining order and discharges the order to show cause why a
preliminary injunction should not issue. 

 


 
BACKGROUND 
 
            In 1990, the City Council passed, and then Mayor Tom Bradley
approved, Ordinance Number 166003 to acquire Lot 707 by eminent domain
(“Ordinance”).  In the Ordinance, the
City Council found that the public interest and necessity require the
acquisition of Lot 707 “for public off-street parking.”  (Slade Decl. Exh. B.)  The Ordinance also includes the following
findings: 
 
[T]he project is planned and located in the manner which is
most compatible with the greatest public good and the least private injury, and
the property described herein is necessary for the project; and the property
has been appraised and an amount has been established which it is believed to
be just compensation for the property, and an offer has been made to the owner
or owners of record to acquire the property for the full amount of said just
compensation.  
 
(Ibid.)    
 
            The
stretch of Pico Boulevard where Lot 707 and the Saucy Bird are located is
subject to an “anti-gridlock” zoning ordinance and parking is prohibited
between the hours of 4 p.m. and 7 p.m.  (See
Slade Decl. Exh. C; LAMC § 80.70; Callesano Decl. ¶ 4.)  The surrounding neighborhood is permit-only
parking, which further limits parking options for the Saucy Bird and similarly
situated businesses in the area. 
(Callesano Decl. ¶ 4; see also Waters Decl. ¶¶ 7-18; Cai Decl. ¶¶
2-21; but see Mahlowitz Decl. Exh. 9 at 94 [discussion of local parking
options].)
 
            On
July 7, 2023, Mayor Karen Bass executed a Declaration of Local Housing and
Homelessness Emergency.  (Mahlowitz Decl.
Exh. 2-3.)  On October 20, 2023, the City
Council approved and allocated funding for a project, referred to as the
“Midvale Ave Interim Housing project” or “Midvale Shelter,” that would provide “emergency
shelter for approximately 33 individuals experiencing homelessness” at Lot
707.  (Id. Exh. 5; Exh. 6 at 42;
and Exh. 7.)  The project approval cites
the Mayor’s July 7, 2023, declaration and states that “[t]he Project is a
specific action necessary to prevent or mitigate an emergency – the conditions
arising from a sudden and unexpected dramatic rise in the City’s already
dangerously large homeless population.” 
(Id. Exh. 6 at 53.)  
 
The City’s solicitation of bids,
released in February 2024, describes the project as follows: 
 
New emergency homeless housing project on an existing LADOT
parking lot 707 at 2377 S Midvale Ave (north lot) and 10909 W Pico Blvd (south
lot). The project will provide modular units and beds for up to 33 individuals
(18 in the north lot and 15 in the south lot). Site Amenities include modular
units with restrooms, showers, and lavatories; laundry stations; administrative
offices; community room; and pet relief area. Site to have perimeter fencing.
 
(Mahlowitz Decl. Exh. 8, Quinonez
Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. 1 at 78.)  The City
architect involved in preparing the request for proposals also explains: 
The Midvale Shelter is designed and will be constructed to
be modular and removable. The Midvale Shelter is designed to be installed atop
two existing surface-level City asphalt parking lots so that when the Midvale
Shelter is removed, the lots will be useable as parking lots and will return to
their parking lot use. 
 
(Quinonez Decl. ¶ 3.)  
 
In July 2024, the City Board of
Public Works approved a construction contract for the Midvale Shelter following
a public bidding.  (Id. ¶ 7, Exh.
3.)  On or about August 16, 2024, the
City announced the closure of Lot 707 for public parking, effective Monday,
August 19, 2024.  Demolition of the lot
began on or about August 19, 2024.  (Cai
Decl. ¶ 13; Waters Decl. ¶ 10; Collesano Decl. ¶¶ 10-11.)
 
Petitioner submits evidence that, at
the City Council meeting on October 20, 2023, Councilmember Katy Yaroslavsky
stated: “For the businesses on Pico, you have my word that we’re going to
secure additional parking before we break ground on this Project.”  (Fliegelman Decl. ¶ 3.)  Respondents submit evidence that the City has
taken steps to find alternate parking, but that it has not completed that
process.  (See Morales Decl. ¶¶ 3-6
[summarizing the City’s “work
exploring efforts that could create additional public parking in the
neighborhood near the Midvale Project”]; Resp. RJN Exh. 18.) 
 
            On August 28, 2024, Petitioner filed its petition for writ
of mandate challenging the City’s decision to convert Lot 707 into temporary,
affordable housing.  The next day,
Petitioner filed its ex parte application for a temporary restraining
order and order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue.  The court (Kin, J.) granted the ex parte
application, issued a temporary restraining order, and issued an order to show
cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue.  
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo
pending a decision on the merits.  (Major v. Miraverde Homeowners Ass’n.
(1992) 7 Cal. App. 4th 618, 623.)  In
deciding whether or not to grant a preliminary injunction, the court looks to
two factors: (1) The likelihood that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits,
and (2) The relative balance of harms that is likely to result from the
granting or denial of interim injunctive relief.  (See White
v. Davis (2003) 30 Cal.4th 528, 553-54.)  The factors are interrelated, with a greater
showing on one permitting a lesser showing on the other.  (Dodge,
Warren & Peters Ins. Services, Inc. v. Riley (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th
1414, 1420.)  However, the party seeking
an injunction must demonstrate at least a reasonable probability of success on
the merits.  (IT Corp. v. County of Imperial (1983) 35 Cal.3d 63, 73-74.)  The party seeking the injunction bears the
burden of demonstrating both a likelihood of success on the merits and the
occurrence of irreparable harm.  (Savage v. Trammell Crow Co. (1990) 223
Cal.App.3d 1562, 1571.) Irreparable harm may exist if the plaintiff can show an
inadequate remedy at law.  (Code Civ.
Proc. § 526(a).) 
 


 
EVIDENTIARY ISSUES 
 
            The court grants the parties’ requests for judicial notice,
none of which is opposed.  The court need
not rule on respondents’ evidentiary objections.  (See Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(q).)  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
A.        Petitioner Seeks both
Prohibitory and Mandatory Injunctions 
 
            In this case,
Petitioner seeks a preliminary mandatory injunction because Petitioner seeks an
order enjoining Respondents “from taking any further action to interfere with
public use of Lot 707 as a parking lot, and to restore Lot 707 to its
lawfully approved public parking lot use.”  (Mot. 2, emphasis added.)  Pictures of Lot 707 submitted in reply show
that the City’s construction efforts have modified Lot 707 to a degree that it
could not be used in its current form for parking.  (Reply Collesano Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. A.)  Thus, Petitioner seeks to compel performance
of an affirmative act that changes the position of the parties.    
 
“The granting of a mandatory injunction pending trial is not permitted
except in extreme cases where the right thereto
is clearly established.”  (Teachers
Ins. & Annuity Ass’n v. Furlotti (1999) 70
Cal.App.4th 1487, 1493.)  “The general
rule is that an injunction is prohibitory if it requires a person¿to refrain
from a particular act and mandatory if it compels performance of an affirmative
act that changes the position of the parties.” 
(Davenport v. Blue Cross of Calif. (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th
435, 448.)  “A preliminary
mandatory injunction is rarely granted….” (Board of Supervisors v. McMahon
(1990) 219 Cal. App.3d 286, 295.)
 
B.        Petitioner Does Not Demonstrate a
Sufficient Likelihood of Success on the Merits
 
Petitioner does
not demonstrate that it has a clear right, and this is the rare case in which a
preliminary mandatory injunction should issue. 
Nor does Petitioner demonstrate a sufficient likelihood of success in
order to obtain the prohibitory injunction, i.e., an order stopping the
construction.  
 
This petition for
writ of mandate is based entirely on Code of Civil Procedure section 1245.245.  Petitioner argues that under the statute, in
order to change the intended use of property seized through eminent domain, the
City must adopt a new “resolution of necessity” by a “super-majority of the
City Council.”  (Petition for Writ of Mandate (“Pet.”) ¶ 51.)  Petitioner argues that the City failed to
comply with this requirement.  In
opposition, Respondents contend that Petitioner does not have a clear right to
a preliminary injunction because: (1) Section 1245.245 applies to property
acquired by eminent domain after January 1, 2007, and this property was seized
before that date; (2) Even if section 1245.245 applies retroactively, Petitioner
lacks standing to file an action under section 1245.245; and (3) Even if
section 1245.245 applies retroactively, and even if Petitioner has standing,
the court cannot issue a writ directing the City to exercise its discretion in
a particular way, so the court does not have authority to issue the requested
preliminary injunction.[1]
 
                        1.         The rules
of statutory interpretation are clear 
 
The rules governing the interpretation of statutes and regulations are well-settled
and clear:    
 
We begin with the
fundamental premise that the objective of statutory interpretation is to
ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.  To determine legislative intent, we turn first
to the words of the statute, giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.  When the language of a statute is clear, we
need go no further. However, when the language is susceptible of more than one
reasonable interpretation, we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including
the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to be remedied, the
legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous administrative
construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.  
 
(Nolan v. City of Anaheim (2004)
33 Cal.4th 335, 340, citations omitted.) 
These same rules apply to the interpretation of a regulation.  (County of Sacramento v. State Water
Resources Control Board (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1579, 1586.)  “When
interpreting statutory language, we may neither insert language which has been
omitted nor ignore language which has been inserted.”  (See People
v. National Auto. and Cas. Ins. Co. (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 277, 282.)  “[I]nterpretations which render any part of a statute [or
regulation] superfluous are to be avoided.”  (Young v. McCoy (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
1078, 1083.)  
            
In interpreting statutes or regulations an administrative agency is
responsible for enforcing, the court exercises its independent judgment, “taking
into account and respecting the agency’s interpretation of its meaning.”  (Housing
Partners I, Inc. v. Duncan (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1335, 1343; see also Yamaha Corp. of America v. State Bd. Of
Equalization (1998) 19 Cal.4th 1, 11.) 
How much weight to
accord an agency’s construction is “situational,” and depends on the
circumstances.  (See American Coatings Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist. (2012)
54 Cal.4th 446, 461-462.)  
 
            2.         Section 1245.245 applies to property
acquired after January 1, 2007
 
Section 1245.245 was enacted in 2006 as part of Senate Bill (“SB”) 1650.  There is no dispute that in order to change
the intended use of property seized through eminent domain, the City Council
must pass a new resolution of necessity by a vote of at least two-thirds of the
members.  However, section 4 of SB 1650,
which is not contained within section 1245.245 states: “This act shall apply prospectively
and shall apply to property acquired after January 1, 2007.”  There is no dispute that this property was
acquired before January 1, 2007.  
 
            Contrary to Petitioner’s assertion, section 4 of SB 1650 is part of the
law adopted by the legislature.  (See Mot.
9-10.)  “An uncodified section is part of
the statutory law.”  (Carter v.
California Dept. of Veterans Affairs (2006) 38 Cal.4th 914, 925.)  “The Codes of this state are simply a part of
the statutory law of this state.  They
have no higher standing or sanctity than any other statute regularly passed by
the Legislature.”  (Los Angeles County
v. Payne (1937) 8 Cal.2d 563, 574.)  
 
            Regardless, there is a
presumption that statutes apply prospectively, not retroactively.  “In construing statutes, there is a
presumption against retroactive application unless the Legislature plainly has
directed otherwise by means of ‘express language of retroactivity or ... other
sources [that] provide a clear and unavoidable implication that the Legislature
intended retroactive application.’”  (California Ins. Guarantee Assn.
v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd. (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 543, 561.)  Similarly, Code of Civil Procedure section 3
provides, “No part of [the Code of Civil Procedure] is retroactive, unless
expressly so declared.”  
 
The rule has been
expressed in varying degrees of strength but always of one import, that a
retrospective operation will not be given to a statute which interferes with
antecedent rights ... unless such be the unequivocal and inflexible import of
the terms, and the manifest intention of the legislature.
 
(Evangelatos v. Superior Court (1988) 44 Cal.3d 1188, 1207.)  Not only is there nothing rebutting this
presumption, even if section 4 of SB 1650 is not law, it provides evidence of
the Legislature’s intention that the statute applies only to property acquired
after January 1, 2007.    
 
Petitioner also argues that Assembly Bill (“AB”) 299, passed into law in
2007, shows legislative intent for section 1245.245 to apply
retroactively.  (Mot. 11.)  Petitioner is incorrect.  Per its own plain language, AB 299 made “technical,
nonsubstantive changes in various provisions of law.”  (Slade Decl. Exh. E, emphasis added.)
 
For the first time in reply, Petitioner argues that it “is not asking
the court to apply §1245.245 retroactively, but rather to apply it to a
current purported change of use.” 
(Reply 4, emphasis added.) 
Petitioner also argues, for the first time, that section 1245.245(e)(1)
establishes that all property transactions by eminent domain, regardless of
when they occurred, are subject to the change of use requirements in section
1245.245(a).  (Reply 4-5.)  Petitioner does not show good cause to raise
these arguments for the first time in reply, as Petitioner clearly knew from
the time of the ex parte hearing of Respondents’ contention that
Petitioner improperly seeks to apply section 1245.245 retroactively.  Putting that aside, these arguments are not
persuasive in light of the Legislature’s plain language: “This act shall apply prospectively
and shall apply to property acquired after January 1, 2007.”    
 
Based upon the foregoing, Petitioner cannot demonstrate a sufficient
likelihood of proving at trial that Code of Civil Procedure section 1245.245
applies retroactively to a property acquired before January 1, 2007.  Therefore, Petitioner is not entitled to a
preliminary injunction.  
 


 
            3.         Petitioner does not establish a
sufficient likelihood of standing 
 
Even if section 1245.245 applied retroactively, Petitioner does not
demonstrate a sufficient likelihood of demonstrating that it has standing to
raise this challenge.  To have standing
to seek a writ of mandate, a party must be “beneficially interested.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1086.)  “A petitioner is beneficially interested if he
or she has some special interest to be served or some particular right to be
preserved or protected over and above the interest held in common with the
public at large.”  (Rialto Citizens for Responsible Growth v. City of Rialto (2012) 208
Cal. App. 4th 899, 913.) 
 
This standard … is equivalent to the federal “injury
in fact” test, which requires a party to prove by a preponderance of the
evidence that it has suffered ‘an invasion of a legally protected interest that
is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural
or hypothetical.  
 
(Associated
Builders and Contractors, Inc. v. San Francisco (1999) 21 Cal.4th 352, 361-362,
citation omitted.)  “A petitioner has no
beneficial interest within the meaning of the statute if he or she will gain no
direct benefit from [the writ’s] issuance and suffer no direct detriment if it
is denied.”  (SJJC Aviation Services,
LLC v. City of San Jose (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 1043, 1053). 
 
In this case, section
1245.245 requires notice of a resolution of changed use to be provided to the
original property owner.  (Code Civ.
Proc. § 1245.245(c); see also Code Civ. Proc. § 1245.235.)  Further, the statute expressly defines the
persons that may seek judicial review: “Judicial
review of an action pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b) may be obtained by a
person who had an interest in the property described in the resolution at the
time that the property was acquired
by the public entity, and shall be governed by Section 1085.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1245.245(d).)  Petitioner does not submit sufficient
evidence that it had an interest in Lot 707 when it was acquired by the City in
1990.  Accordingly, pursuant to the plain
language of section 1245.245(c) and (d), Petitioner lacks standing to seek
judicial review and does not have a beneficial interest in a writ compelling
compliance with the statute.[2] 
 
For the first time
in reply, Petitioner argues that it has public interest standing to enforce section 1245.245
pursuant to Common Cause v. Board of Supervisors (1989) 49 Cal.3d 432,
439.  (Reply 8.)  “The salutary rule is that points raised in a reply brief for the first
time will not be considered unless good cause is shown for the failure to
present them before.”  (Balboa Ins.
Co. v. Aguirre (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 1002, 1010.)  Respondents challenged Petitioner’s standing
in the ex parte opposition filed September 3, 2024.  Petitioner had the opportunity to address
that issue in its supplemental papers filed September 9, 2024, but Petitioner
failed to do so.  Accordingly, Petitioner
does not show good cause to raise an exception to the standing requirement in
reply.  
 
                        4.         Petitioner does not demonstrate the
court has authority to issue relief 
 
            Even if section
1245.245 applies retroactively, and even if Petitioner has standing, Petitioner
does not demonstrate a sufficient likelihood that the court can issue the
requested relief.  “The scope of
available preliminary relief is necessarily limited by the scope of the relief
likely to be obtained at trial on the merits.” 
(O’Connell v. Superior Court (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1463.)  Petitioner seeks a preliminary injunction
enjoining Respondents “from
taking any further action to interfere with public use of Lot 707 as a parking
lot, and to restore Lot 707 to its lawfully approved public parking lot
use.”  (Mot. 2.)  However, if the court were to find that the
City failed to comply with section 1245.245, the court could only order the
City to comply with the statute.  The
City would have the option of: (1) adopting a new resolution of use by a vote
of two-thirds of the member; (2) selling Lot 707 as surplus property (with the
original owners having the right of first refusal; or (3) restoring the
parking.  The court cannot compel the
City to elect the third option because such an order would interfere with the
City’s exercise of discretion.  “[M]andamus will not lie to control the discretion of a court or officer,
meaning by that that it will not lie to force the exercise of discretion in a
particular manner….’”  (Flores v.
Dept. of Corrections & Rehabilitation (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 199, 208.)  Therefore, Petitioner does not demonstrate
that the court has authority to issue a preliminary injunction to “restore the
parking.”     
 
            C.        Petitioner Does Not Demonstrate that the
Balance of Harms Favors its Position 
 
Because Petitioner is not entitled to a preliminary injunction for the
reasons discussed, so the court need not reach the issue of whether the balance
of harms favors Petitioner.  Regardless,
this analysis does not benefit Petitioner’s position.  Because Respondents are public entities,
Petitioner has a high burden: 
 
Where, as here, the
defendants are public agencies and the plaintiff seeks to restrain them in the
performance of their duties, public policy considerations also come into play.
There is a general rule against enjoining public officers or agencies from
performing their duties…. This rule would not preclude a court from
enjoining unconstitutional or void acts, but to support a request for such
relief the plaintiff must make a significant showing of irreparable injury.
 
(Tahoe Keys
Property Owners’ Assn. v. State Water Resources Control Bd. (1994) 23
Cal.App.4th 1459, 1471.)  
 
Even considering
Petitioner’s evidence over Respondents’ objections, Petitioner does not submit
sufficient evidence of harm to its business. 
Nor has Petitioner provided persuasive evidence that substitute public
parking will not be arranged in the near future.  Indeed, the City Council passed a motion on
September 18, 2024, to negotiate and execute a lease for replacement parking at
a vacant lot located on Pico Boulevard.  (Resp.
RJN Exh. 18-20.)  Petitioner does not
show that it has any vested right to public parking at Lot 707 or elsewhere.  “[T]he deprivation of parking rights on abutting streets …
constitutes a noncompensable exercise of the city's police power.”   (See Brumer v. Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1738, 1749; accord
People ex rel. Dept. of Public Works v. Presley (1966) 239 Cal.App.2d 309,
314-316.)  Petitioner fails to address
that issue or explain how it could suffer irreparable harm from the City’s
exercise of its police power with respect to public parking.  Finally, Petitioner substantially delayed in
bringing this action and the application for injunctive relief.  (See Oppo. 14, 20.)  The City Council approved the Midvale Shelter project on October 20, 2023. (Mahlowitz
Decl. Exh. 5; Exh. 6 at 42; and Exh. 7.) 
City released a solicitation of bids for construction of the project in
February 2024. (Mahlowitz Decl. Exh. 8, Quinonez Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. 1 at 78.)  This action was not filed until August 28,
2024.  “Long delays in assertion of
rights can be the basis of denial of mandatory injunctive relief.”  (O’Connell v. Sup.Ct. (2006) 141
Cal.App.4th 1452, 1481.)  
 
            By
contrast, Respondents have demonstrated that the City would suffer irreparable
harm if the preliminary injunction is granted. 
The project approval cites the Mayor’s July 7, 2023, declaration and
states that “[t]he Project is a specific action necessary to prevent or
mitigate an emergency – the conditions arising from a sudden and unexpected
dramatic rise in the City’s already dangerously large homeless population.” (Mahlowitz
Decl. Exh. 6 at 53.)  Further,
Respondents have already commenced construction and incurred public funds on
the project (which could have been avoided had Petitioner sought relief sooner).  (See generally Quinonez Decl. and
Reply Collesano Decl. Exh. A.)  To the
extent the court must reach the issue, the balance of harms weighs in favor of denying
injunctive relief.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            Based
upon the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The court finds that Petitioner is not
entitled to a preliminary injunction for the reasons discussed.
 
            2.         The court dissolves the temporary
restraining order and discharges the order to show cause why a preliminary
injunction shall not issue.
 
            3.         Petitioner’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of service with the court.
