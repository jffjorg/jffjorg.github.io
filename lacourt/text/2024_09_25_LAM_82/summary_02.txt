The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion to reopen discovery, which the Judge construes as a noticed motion. The Judge had previously offered to continue the hearing to October 25, 2024, and authorized the petitioner to file an opposition. However, the petitioner's counsel waived written notice and opted to proceed with the hearing today. The ruling also references a confidential and proprietary estimate developed by Curtis, which estimates lost profits at $1.5 million per year.
