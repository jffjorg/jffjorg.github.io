And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition for writ of mandate filed by Brooke Pierce. The petition challenges the Medi-Cal share of cost notices sent to her by Los Angeles County in 2017, 2019, and 2020. The court finds that the notices were mailed to Pierce on the dates specified and that she received them. The court also finds that Pierce's request for an administrative hearing was untimely and that she did not meet her burden to show a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that regard.

The court notes that Pierce raised new arguments in her reply brief that were not adequately raised or developed in her opening brief. The court holds that these arguments are not considered because they were not properly raised in the opening brief and that Pierce did not show good cause to raise them for the first time in reply.

As a result, the petition for writ of mandate is denied, and the parties are directed to meet and confer and lodge a proposed judgment.
