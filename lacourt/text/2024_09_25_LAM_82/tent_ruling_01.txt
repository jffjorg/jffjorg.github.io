[TENTATIVE] Order #1
 
            The court construes the City’s
opposition as a motion to reopen discovery. 
The court continues the hearing to October 25, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. to
afford statutory notice.  The court
authorizes Petitioner to file an opposition (instead of relying on its reply
brief), and for the City to file a reply brief, based upon statutory deadlines.
 
 
[TENTATIVE] Order #2
 
NOTICE
 
To the extent a noticed motion to reopen
discovery is required, the court construes the opposition as such a motion.  The court provided notice that it intended to
do so, offered to continue the hearing to October 25, 2024, at 9:30 a.m., and
authorized Petitioner to file an opposition (instead of relying on the reply
brief).  Petitioner’s counsel waived
written notice and a further opportunity to brief this “motion” and elected to
go forward today.  
 
INTRODUCTION  
 
            The California Housing Defense Fund
(“CHDF” or “Petitioner”) filed this action on July 25, 2023, alleging that the
City of La Cañada Flintridge (the “City” or “Respondent”) violated the “Builder’s
Remedy” provision of California’s Housing Accountability Act, Government Code
section 65589.5 (the “HAA”) in connection with an application for a real estate
development project filed by the real party in interest, 600 Foothill Owner LP
(“Foothill” or the  “real party”).  The court (Beckloff, J.) granted the petition
and entered judgment in favor of petitioner. 

 
            On April 11, 2024, the City filed a
notice of appeal.  Then, on June 17,
2024, Petitioner filed a motion for an appeal bond under Government Code
section 65589.5(m), seeking to require the City to post a bond in the amount of
$14,096,952.  The bond motion is
supported by a declaration from Jonathan C. Curtis, a founding member of the
real estate development firm that manages Foothill, estimating the losses as a
result of the appeal.  In response, the
City served various subpoenas.  Now,
Foothill moves for a protective order, arguing that the City did not move to
reopen discovery under Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050.  The motion is denied.  
 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2017.010 provides: “Unless otherwise
limited by order of the court in accordance with this title, any party may
obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject
matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of any motion
made in that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or
appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.)  An
“action” includes “a civil action and a special proceeding of a civil
nature.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §
2016.020(a).)  In deciding whether to reopen discovery in a
pretrial context, the court must consider the following factors, among others:
(1) The necessity and the reasons for the discovery; (2) The
diligence or lack of diligence of the party seeking the discovery or the
hearing of a discovery motion, and the reasons that the discovery was not
completed or that the discovery motion was not heard earlier; (3) Any
likelihood that permitting the discovery or hearing the discovery motion will
prevent the case from going to trial on the date set, or otherwise interfere
with the trial calendar, or result in prejudice to any other party; and (4) The
length of time that has elapsed between any date previously set, and the date
presently set, for the trial of the action. 
(See Code Civ. Proc. § 2024.050(b).) 
  
 
For good cause shown, the court may enter a protective order or an order
quashing a subpoena to prevent unwarranted annoyances, embarrassment,
oppression, undue burden, and expense in discovery.  (Fireman’s
Fund Ins. Co. v. Sup. Ct. (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1138, 1141; see also
Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.420(b), § 2017.020(a), § 1987.1.)  The moving party has the burden to show good
cause for a protective order or an order quashing a deposition subpoena. (See Emerson Elec. Co. v. Sup. Ct. (1997) 16
Cal.4th 1101, 1110; Weil & Brown, Civ. Pro. Before Trial (The Rutter Group
2011) ¶ 8:689.) 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            Foothill argues that “the
City ha[s] no right to take discovery in the action unless it filed a Motion
under Code of Civil Procedure §2024.050 and that Motion is granted by the Court,”
citing In re Marriage of Boblitt (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1004.  There are two problems with this
argument.  First, per the statute’s plain
language, section 2024.050 relates to pretrial discovery.  Second, the Boblitt case and its
progeny are specific to marital dissolution proceedings: 
 
[T]here is no automatic
right to conduct discovery under the Civil Discovery Act in connection with a
postjudgment motion in a marital dissolution proceeding. To
secure the right to conduct such discovery, a party must secure the agreement
of the other party or must obtain a court order [pursuant to section 2024.050]
for leave to conduct discovery.

 
(Id. at 1024, emphasis added.)  After the Boblitt
ruling, the California legislature passed AB 2586, codified in Family Code
section 218, and which states in pertinent part: “With respect to the ability
to conduct formal discovery in family law proceedings, when a
request for order or other motion is filed and served after entry of judgment,
discovery shall automatically reopen as to the issues raised in the
postjudgment pleadings currently before the court.”  (See Mot. 11-13; Bergland Decl. Exh. C,
emphasis added.)  All of this law is
specific to family law proceedings. 
Petitioner’s counsel argues that “rules governing practice and procedure
(including discovery) in civil cases apply to family law as well,” citing a
Senate Judiciary Committee commentary.  (See
Motion at 12:23-16.)  But the reverse is
not necessarily true.  
 
            This is an equitable
writ proceeding.  The court has
broad authority to authorize limited discovery that is relevant to the case,
including to respond to a post-judgment motion for an appeal bond.  (See Code Civ. Proc. § 187; City of Los Angeles v. Superior Court
(Anderson-Barker) (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 272, 288 [“the right to civil
discovery in special proceedings of a civil nature remains subject to the trial
court’s authority to manage discovery”]; Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. (1997)
16 Cal.4th 953, 967 [“courts have fundamental inherent equity, supervisory, and
administrative powers, as well as inherent power to control litigation before
them”].)  
 
The court denies
the motion and shall permit limited discovery in the exercise of
its discretion.[1]  Foothill does not dispute that, in principle, a party faced with a post-judgment motion for appeal
bond may be entitled to fact discovery to respond the evidence upon which the
bond motion is based.  (See Reply
2:2-12.)  Rather, Petitioner focuses on
the lack of a motion to reopen discovery. 
Here, the bond motion seeks an order requiring City to post an appeal
bond of approximately $14 million, a substantial sum, based upon specific
calculations and estimates of losses, e.g., interest payments, overhead,
project management fees, additional costs due to inflation, cost of equity
capital, loss of net rental income, etc. 
Some of these calculations are not supported by any citation to the
record.[2]  Petitioner cannot reasonably seek a bond in
such a high amount based upon fact-intensive calculations, relying on evidence
not contained within the record, and then turn around and deny the City the
opportunity to understand and challenge those calculations.  Had Petitioner sought a bond in a lower
amount, i.e., an amount that was verifiable  on its face, the court may have reached a
different decision on this motion.     
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
            Based upon the foregoing, the court
orders as follows:
 
            1.         Petitioner’s
motion for a protective order is denied.
 
            2.         The
court shall permit limited discovery on the issues raised by
Petitioner’s motion to post an appeal bond.
 
            3.         The
court orders the parties to meet-and-confer concerning the scope of discovery
and to file a proposed discovery plan on or before October 2, 2024.  If the parties are unable to agree on a
discovery plan, they shall file a joint statement outlining their respective
positions.  The joint statement shall be
four (4) pages or less, i.e., each side shall have two (2) pages to outline
their respective positions.  If the
parties reach resolutions on any of the pending motions, they shall note that
in the joint statement.    
 
            4.         The
court sets a non-appearance case review for October 4, 2024, at 1:30 p.m.  
 
            5.         Petitioner’s
motion to post an appeal bond is advanced and continued to November 8, 2024, at
9:30 a.m.  If the parties do not resolve
their discovery disputes and the court must decide any of the pending discovery
motions, the court will continue the hearing to a date after those motions are
decided.
 
            6.         All
requests for sanctions are denied. 
 
            7.         Petitioner’s
counsel shall provide notice and file proof of service with the court.   
 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED
