[Tentative] Order Denying Petition for
Writ of Mandate
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
            Petitioner Brooke Pierce (“Petitioner”) filed a petition for
writ of administrative mandate directing Respondent Kimberley Johnson, Director
of the California Department of Social Services (“Respondent”) to set aside a
final administrative decision dismissing Petitioner’s appeal of Medi-Cal share
of cost notices from 2017, 2019, and 2020. 
The Administrative Law Judge (the “ALJ”) found that the County of Los
Angeles (the “County”) mailed Notices of Action concerning her late husband’s
share of the cost of services on June 9, 2017; April 26, 2019; December 14,
2019; and January 21, 2020, and that Petitioner received these notices.  Petitioner did not request a hearing to
challenge the County’s determinations until October 28, 2022, well after the 180-day
statute of limitations.  The court finds
that substantial evidence, and the weight
of the evidence, supports the ALJ’s findings that that the notices were mailed
to Petitioner on the dates specified and that Petitioner received them.  At the administrative hearing, Petitioner
confirmed that her address was correct; testified that she “more than likely”
received them; and presented no evidence suggesting that she did not receive
them.  Therefore, the court denies the
petition for writ of mandate.  
 
BACKGROUND 
 
A.        Regulatory Framework 
 
“Medicaid is a cooperative federal-state
program through which the federal government reimburses states for certain
medical expenses incurred on behalf of needy persons.”  (Keffeler v. Partnership Healthplan of
California (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 322, 326-27, citation omitted.)  Medi-Cal is California’s state Medicaid
program.  (See Mission Community
Hospital v. Kizer (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1683, 1688-1689.) 
 
Each county in California has a welfare
department responsible for local administration of the Medi-Cal program. (22 Cal.
Code Regs. § 50004(c).)  On behalf of the
Department of Social Services (the “Department”), the County calculates
beneficiaries “share of cost” by subtracting the appropriate maintenance need
from the Medi-Cal Family Budget Unit from the net income.  (See AR 12 and 22 Cal. Code Regs. §
50653.)
 
“In 1973 the Legislature enacted the In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS)
program to enable aged, blind or disabled poor to avoid institutionalization by
remaining in their homes with proper supportive services.”  (Miller v. Woods (1983) 148 Cal.App.3d
862, 867.)  “The Department and its
director are responsible for administering the IHSS program in compliance with
state and federal laws.”  (Id. at
868.)  IHSS is only available to individuals
eligible for Medi-Cal. (Welf. & Inst. § 12300(i).)  
 
B.        Petitioner Receives Share of Cost
Notices in 2017, 2019, and 2020
 
Petitioner’s husband, Brad Pierce, was
a recipient of Medi-Cal and IHSS benefits. 
(See AR 3-4, 29-39; Petition for Writ of Mandate (“Pet.”) ¶ 27.)[1]  From 2017 to 2020, the County sent Petitioner
four Notices of Action (“NOA”) regarding Brad Pierce’s Medi-Cal share of cost.  The NOAs are dated June 9, 2017; April 26,
2019; December 14, 2019; and January 21, 2020. 
(AR 28-39.)  The notices informed Petitioner
of a change to Brad Pierce’s Medi-Cal share of cost. (Ibid.)  Specifically, the Notices of Action informed
Petitioner of shares of cost of $1,410 effective June 1, 2017; $1,523 effective
May 1, 2019; $1,536 effective January 1, 2020; and $1,391 effective February 1,
2020.  (Ibid.)  The NOAs were addressed to Petitioner and included
her mailing address.  (Ibid.)  
 
C.        The County Deducted the Share of Costs
from a Retroactive Award of Benefits
 
Petitioner first applied for IHSS
benefits on behalf of Brad Pierce in 2017. (AR 15, 51-52.)  The County denied the Petitioner’s request for
IHSS benefits on March 7, 2017.  (Ibid.)
 In 2022, Petitioner successfully
appealed the 2017 denial of IHSS benefits.  (AR 15.)  The County retroactively approved IHSS
benefits from March 7, 2017, to September 28, 2021, in the amount of $96,881.62.
(AR 16.)  However, Petitioner received a
check only for $76,627.07 because the County deducted the Medi-Cal share of
costs amounts indicated in the NOAs.  (Ibid.)  
 
D.        Petitioner
Received an Administrative
Hearing and Decision 
 
In October 2022, Petitioner’s
authorized representative requested an administrative hearing regarding the
four Medi-Cal share of cost notices sent to her in 2017-2020.  (AR 16.) 

The County requested a bifurcated
hearing on the timeliness of Petitioner’s appeal of the share of cost notices,
and that request was granted.  (AR 3-4,
16.)  After an administrative hearing, the
administrative law judge (“ALJ”) dismissed Petitioner’s state hearing request
on the grounds it was untimely.  (AR
3.)  Respondent adopted the ALJ’s
decision as its final decision.  (AR
2.)  This writ petition followed.
 
STANDARD OF REVIEW 
 
Under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1094.5(b), the pertinent issues are whether the
respondent has proceeded without jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial,
and whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion.  An abuse of discretion is established if the
agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the decision is not
supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the
evidence.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5(b).)
 
            Petitioner
does not dispute that this case does not involve a fundamental vested right and
that the “substantial evidence” test applies. 
(See Opening Brief (“OB”) 3:4-16.)  “In an administrative writ proceeding that .
. . does not involve a fundamental vested right, the trial court reviews the
agency’s factual findings for substantial evidence and its legal conclusions de
novo.”  (Reznitskiy v. County of Marin
(2022) 79 Cal.App.5th 1016, 1023.)  “A
‘fundamental vested right’ denotes a right that is already possessed as opposed
to a right that is merely sought.”  (Kalway v. City of Berkley (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 827, 832.) [2]  On questions of law arising in mandate
proceedings, including the interpretation of a statute or regulation, the court
exercises independent judgment.  (See Christensen v. Lightbourne (2017) 15
Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251; State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Quackenbush
(1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 65, 77.)  
 
DISCUSSION
 
            A.        The NOAs Were Mailed in a Timely Manner 
 
            Petitioner argues that
the NOAs were “not adequate” because “the four NOAs for the Share of Cost were
created years after the ‘effective dates’ of the Shares of Cost.”  (OB at 3:28-4:1.)  Under the
pertinent regulations:

 
The Notice of Action shall be mailed for: (1) Adverse
actions, at least 10 calendar days prior to the first of the month in which the
action becomes effective, excluding the date of mailing [and] (2)
Discontinuances or increases in the share of cost which are not adverse
actions, in sufficient time to reach the beneficiary by the effective date of
the action. . . .   
 
(22 Cal. Code
Regs. § 50179(d).)  Simply,
Petitioner argues that “[c]ontrary to the regulation, the NOAs were mailed or
otherwise sent to [Petitioner] two or more years after the effective
dates.”  (OB at 4:13-15, emphasis added.)  
 
The ALJ found that the County issued the NOAs on June 9,
2017; April 26, 2019; December 14, 2019; and January 21, 2020.  (AR 4.) 
The ALJ also found that Petitioner “received” the NOAs.  (Ibid.)  Petitioner challenges this finding, arguing:
“At hearing (AR 52 -AR 83) there was no corroborating testimony that the
Notices were issued on the dates that Los Angeles County (County) says they
were issued. County Witness, Jose Torres, did not clearly testify the NOAs
were, in fact, mailed on the alleged dates.” 
(Reply 1.)
 
As Petitioner acknowledges, the NOAs were addressed to her,
include her mailing address, and specify the “notice date.”  (AR 28-38.) 
Thus, on the face of the NOAs, there is evidence of mailing to
Petitioner on the notice date of each NOA. 
Petitioner confirmed that her mailing address was correct.  (AR 67.) 
Petitioner does not cite any evidence from the record, such as her own
testimony, that proves that the NOAs were not mailed on the notice dates and
received shortly thereafter.  To the
contrary, Petitioner admitted that she “more than likely” received the NOAs
when they were sent in 2017, 2019, and 2020. 
(AR 65.)   
 
Counsel:          Ms. Pierce, do you recall getting these
notices of action telling you that there was a share of cost?
 
Petitioner:       I --
I don’t remember.  I -- I think so.  I mean, you know, I would just file them
away, and that was pretty much what I would do. 
So, I’d have to go through my files to see if I received them.  But more than likely I did.  
 
(Ibid.)  At the
administrative hearing, Petitioner’s authorized representative confirmed that
Petitioner “probably did receive the notices.” 
(AR 67.)  Substantial evidence,
and the weight of the evidence, supports the ALJ’s findings that that the NOAs
were mailed to Petitioner on the dates specified and that Petitioner received
them. [3]  
 
B.        The ALJ Did
Not Err in Finding this Matter Was Untimely
 
Upon
receipt of a Notice of Action, including with respect to a Medi-Cal share of
cost, a beneficiary has 90 days to request a state hearing.  (See Welf. & Inst. Code § 10951(a)(1).)
If good cause exists, a beneficiary may file a request beyond the 90 days.  (Id. § 10951 (a)(2).) However, the
Department “shall not grant a request for a hearing for good cause if the
request is filed more than 180 days after the order or action complained of.”  (Ibid.)
 
As discussed, the NOAs were mailed on or
about June 9, 2017; April 26, 2019; December 14, 2019; and January 21, 2020,
and Petitioner received them shortly thereafter.   Petitioner
made her request for a state hearing on October 28, 2022, well more than 180
days after receipt of the NOAs.  (AR
3.)  Accordingly, the ALJ correctly determined
that Petitioner’s request for a hearing was untimely and the good-cause
exception pursuant to section 10951 was inapplicable.  (AR 14.) 
Petitioner
does not meet her burden to show a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that
finding.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5(b).)
 
C.        Petitioner’s New
Arguments in Reply Brief 
 
Petitioner raises
a series of new arguments in her reply brief. 
First, Petitioner argues as follows:
 
The failure of the receptionist to act in a lawful
manner, i.e., to accept the intake and inform Brooke Peirce of the Spousal Impoverishment
Program (and refrain from telling her that caring for her husband is her
responsibility) taints the NOAs from March 7, 2017 to beyond November 30, 2022
(the death of Brad Pierce).  
 
(Reply
3:8-12.)  Petitioner further argues that
the “receptionist violated Welf. & Inst. Code § 10500 by failing to provide
information on the SI [spousal impoverishment] program or its prototype,
Assisted Living Waiver ….”  (Reply
5.)  Relatedly, Petitioner asserts that the
ALJ was “dismissive” of Petitioner’s testimony that she had a spousal
impoverishment form in place such that the share of cost deductions were
incorrect, and that failure of the ALJ to consider such testimony deprived
Petitioner a fair trial.  (Reply 4-5.)  Petitioner also suggests that she may have
“paid the SOC twice.”  (Reply 6:12.)  
 
None of these
arguments was adequately raised or developed in the opening brief.  Although Petitioner included a reference to the
“person answering the telephone in 2017” in the opening brief, the argument was
unintelligible and not presented in a manner that provided sufficient notice
and opportunity to respond.  (See OB
4:22-28.)  Petitioner otherwise did not
raise any argument in the opening brief about Welfare and Institutions Code
section 10500; the ALJ being dismissive of her testimony about the spousal
impoverishment form; being deprived a fair trial; a concern about paying the
share of costs twice; or similar issues raised in reply.  Nor were there sufficient citations to the
administrative record.  
 
“The salutary rule is that points raised in a reply brief for the first
time will not be considered unless good cause is shown for the failure to
present them before.”  (Balboa Ins.
Co. v. Aguirre (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 1002, 1010; see also Regency
Outdoor Advertising v. Carolina Lances, Inc. (1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1323, 1333.) 
Petitioner has not shown good cause to raise these arguments for the
first time in reply, depriving Respondent an opportunity to provide a written
opposition.
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
            Based
upon the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
1.         The
petition for writ of mandate is denied. 
Because the court denies the petition, it need not address Petitioner’s
issues to be considered on remand.  (See
OB 5.)  
 
2.         The
parties shall meet-and-confer and lodge a proposed judgment.
 
3.         The court’s
clerk shall provide notice.  
 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED
