[1] Brad Pierce
passed away after Petitioner requested an administrative hearing.  (AR 3.)


[2] In the
alternative, the court reaches the same result even if it exercises its
independent judgment on all issues and applies the “weight of the evidence”
standard to the review of administrative fact findings.  (See Bixby v. Pierno (1971) 4 Cal. 3d 130, 143.)  


[3] Petitioner does
not challenge any other aspect of the NOAs. 
Regardless, substantial evidence, and the weight of the evidence,
supports the ALJ’s findings that the NOAs include the  information required under Title 22,
California Code of Regulations, section 50179(a) and were adequate.  (See AR 28-37.)
