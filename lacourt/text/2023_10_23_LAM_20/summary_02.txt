And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lemon law action between plaintiffs Enrique Perez and Jennifer Perez and defendant General Motors LLC. The plaintiffs moved to compel further responses to their requests for production and seek monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,210.00. The judge granted the motion in part, ordering the defendant to provide further responses to certain requests related to their general policies and procedures, as well as requests for documents identifying OBDII, symptom, and repair codes for the subject vehicle. The judge denied the motion as to requests seeking complaints and repair information for vehicles other than the subject vehicle, finding them to be overbroad and over-burdensome. The judge also declined to award sanctions. The plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of the ruling and, if counsel do not submit on the tentative, are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
