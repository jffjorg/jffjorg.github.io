And here is the English-text summary:

In the case of Gearhart v. Critter Busters Inc., et al., the court has made a tentative ruling on the motions to be relieved as counsel for defendants David Charles San Filippo and Critter Busters Inc. The motions are granted because they meet all requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. The court notes that Critter Busters Inc. is a corporate entity and cannot represent itself in court. As a result, an OSC Re: Representation will be set for fourteen days from hearing, at which time Critter Busters Inc. must appear with substitute counsel. The attorneys are relieved as counsel of record for their clients effective upon the filing of the proof of service for the court order.
