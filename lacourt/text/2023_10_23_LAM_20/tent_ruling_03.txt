BACKGROUND
On June 5, 2023, Plaintiff 1200 Management
LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint which did not state the names of the
defendants, but the summons was directed to Defendants Gianni Lee, Aaron Ramey,
and Alexander Gutierrez. The action was for recovery of COVID-19 rental debt as
defined under Code of Civil Procedure section 1179.02. 
On August 7, 2023, default was entered
against Defendant Aaron Ramey. 
On August 16, 2023, default was entered
against Defendant Gianni Lee.
On September 14, 2023, the action was
dismissed without prejudice, as to Defendant Alexander Gutierrez.
On September 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants Gianni Lee, Aaron
Ramey, Alexander Gutierrez, and Mark Wrice. On the same day, Plaintiff filed a
Request for Court Judgment against Defendants Gianni Lee and Aaron Ramey. 
On October 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
summons on the FAC as to Defendants Gianni Lee, Aaron Ramey, Alexander
Gutierrez, and Mark Wrice.
            Before the Court is Plaintiff’s
Request for Court Judgment. 
DISCUSSION
            Code of Civil Procedure section 585
permits a default judgment after a defendant’s default has been entered. California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a) requires a party seeking default judgment by
court judgment to use the mandatory Request for Entry of Default
(Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) and to file: “(1) Except in unlawful
detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and the
nature of plaintiff's claim; (2) Declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) Interest computations as necessary; (4)
A memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) A declaration of nonmilitary
status for each defendant against whom judgment is sought; (6) A proposed form
of judgment; (7) A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought
or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of
Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; (8) Exhibits as necessary; and (9) A request for attorney fees if
allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.”
            Plaintiff
requests a total judgment of $31,312.77, consisting of damages in the amount of
$21,325.00 as demanded in the complaint, interest in the amount of $2,660.67, costs
in the amount of $1,362.10, and attorney fees in the amount of $5,965.00. (Form
CIV-100, ¶¶ 2, 7; see also [Proposed] Judgment, ¶ 6 and Shy Decl.,
¶¶ 2-7.) Plaintiff used mandatory form
CIV-100 (which includes a declaration of nonmilitary status (¶ 8)) and complied
with some of the other requirements of CRC, rule 3.1800(a).
Plaintiff submitted a [Proposed] Judgment on Form JUD-100, and a declaration
calculating the interest due on the past due rent, parking fees, and late fees at 10% from and
after April 6, 2022. (Shy Decl. ¶ 6-7). 
The
Court notes that the FAC was filed after default was entered against Defendants
Aaron Ramey and Gianni Lee. However, the amended complaint was not substantive
as it only added additional exhibits and new defendants. “A defendant who is in default as to
the original complaint is entitled to service of an amended pleading making a
change of substance, as opposed to a change of form, and has a right to answer
or demur thereto.” (Ford v. Superior Court (1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 338, 342.)

‘It is settled by a long line of decisions that where, after
the default of a defendant has been entered, a complaint is amended in matter
of substance as distinguished from mere matter of form, the amendment opens the
default and unless the amended pleading be served on the defaulting defendant,
no judgment can properly be entered. (Citations omitted.) The reason for this
rule is plain. A defendant is entitled to opportunity to be heard upon the
allegations of the complaint on which judgment is sought against him. His
default on the original complaint is limited in its effect to that complaint,
and if by amendment a matter of substance is added he should be given the
opportunity to contest the same before any judgment is given against him on
account thereof.’ 
(Leo v. Dunlap (1968) 260
Cal.App.2d 24, 27.)
However, Plaintiff’s request for default
judgment is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE for the following reason.
Plaintiff’s counsel has not properly
requested fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
871.11, which provides: “(a) Notwithstanding any other law, in any action to
recover COVID-19 rental debt, as defined in Section 1179.02, brought as a
limited or unlimited civil case, the court shall not, under ordinary
circumstances, award reasonable attorneys’ fees to a prevailing party that
exceed the following amounts: (1) If the matter is uncontested, five hundred
dollars ($500); (2) If the matter is contested, one thousand dollars ($1,000).”
Here, Plaintiff’s counsel requests attorney fees which exceeds $500 by requesting $5,965.00.
Notwithstanding,
the default judgment is denied for the foregoing reasons. 
CONCLUSION
Plaintiff’s
Request for Default Judgment is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
