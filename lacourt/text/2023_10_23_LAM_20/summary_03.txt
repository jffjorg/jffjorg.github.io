And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, 1200 Management LLC, is seeking a default judgment against defendants Gianni Lee, Aaron Ramey, Alexander Gutierrez, and Mark Wrice. The court has reviewed the plaintiff's request and has denied it without prejudice. The reason for the denial is that the plaintiff's counsel has not properly requested fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 871.11, which limits the amount of attorney fees that can be awarded in COVID-19 rental debt cases. The court notes that the plaintiff's amended complaint was filed after default was entered against the defendants, but the amendment did not add any new claims or relief, and therefore did not open the default. The court also notes that the plaintiff's request for default judgment is denied without prejudice, and the plaintiff must give notice.
