Discussion
On March 8, 2023, Defendants
served Form Interrogatories, Request for Admissions, and Request for Production
of Documents on Plaintiff. (Lloyd Decl., ¶ 2 Exh. A.) The responses were due on
April 12, 2023. On April 12, 2023, having received no responses from Plaintiff
in Pro Per, Defendants’ counsel sent a meet an confer letter to Plaintiff
requesting Plaintiff’s responses to the discovery without objections, as
objections had been waived. Responses were requested by April 21, 2023. (Id., ¶
3; Exh. B.) To date, Defendant has not received Plaintiff’s responses. (Id., ¶
4.)
As Defendants
properly served discovery requests and Plaintiff failed to provide responses,
the Court finds Defendants are entitled to a court order directing Plaintiff to
provide verified responses to the discovery requests served on Plaintiff. 
The Court also finds Defendants are entitled to an order establishing the truth
of the matters in the request for admissions served on Plaintiff. 
Therefore, the motions are granted. 
 
Defendants seek sanctions against Plaintiff. Sanctions are only mandatory in connection with motions to compel
responses to interrogatories and request for production when the motion is unsuccessfully opposed. (Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c).) The motions were not opposed.
As such, the request for sanctions in connection with these motions is denied.
 
Defendants’ request for
sanctions under CCP section 2023.010 for the misuse of discovery is also
denied, as "sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 do not independently authorize
the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.” (City of Los Angeles v.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504.)
However,
sanctions are mandatory in connection with a motion to deem the truth of the
matter in the requests for admissions admitted. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).) Thus, the request for sanctions in
connection with this motion is granted. However, the amount awarded is reduced
due to the simplicity of this motion and lack of opposition. As such, the Court
imposes sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $265 ($205 per hour for
one hour, plus $60 filing fee) to be paid within 30 days of this order.
