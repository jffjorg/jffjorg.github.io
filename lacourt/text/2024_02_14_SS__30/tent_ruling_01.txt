  Case Number:  21STCV13491    Hearing Date:   February 14, 2024    Dept:  30 Background  On April 9, 2021, Plaintiff  Tawny Marie Byrd filed a complaint against Defendants Emily  D. Linares Olivares, Victor Charles. Papke, and Rodis A. Medina, alleging a cause of action  for negligence, arising out of a vehicle collision. On June 15, 2021, Plaintiff  Richard Jackson filed a complaint against Defendants Emily Linares, Uber  Technologies and Raiser LLC, alleging a cause of action for negligence, arising  out of a vehicle collision. These cases were consolidated  on December 23, 2022. On November 21, 2023, Defendant  Olivares filed this motion to compel the deposition Plaintiff Jackson. No  opposition has been filed. Legal  Standard    Any party may obtain discovery …  by taking the oral deposition of any person, including any party to the action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.)   CCP section¿2025.450(a)  provides:¿“If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action . .  . , without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to  appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any  document . . . described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice  may move for an order compelling  the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of  any document . . . described in the deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,  § 2025.450(a).)  Where a party objects to the deposition, the  proper remedy is an objection under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.410.  If such an objection is made within three calendar days before the deposition  date, the objecting party must make personal service of that objection. (Code  Civ. Proc. 2025.410, subd. (b).)  CCP section¿2025.450(b) provides:¿“A  motion under subdivision (a)… shall be accompanied by a meet and confer  declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the  deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or  things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the  petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”¿ (Id.,  § 2025.450(b).)  Discussion  On March 7, 2023, Defendant served  Plaintiff Jackson’s counsel, with a deposition notice, scheduled for March 22,  2023. (Hemmati Decl., ¶ 3.) The deposition was taken off calendar to give  Jackson’s counsel an opportunity to participate in this case. Defendant never  heard back from Jackson’s counsel regarding deposition dates. On March 27,  2023, Defendant served a unilateral second amended deposition notice, scheduled  for April 7, 2023. (Id., ¶ 4.) On April 7, 2023, Jackson and his counsel failed  to appear for the deposition or notify parties that they are not appearing. Defendant  took a Certificate of Non- Appearance. (Id., ¶ 5; Exh. 1.) To move the process  forward, Defendant again requested deposition dates from Jackson’s counsel,  however, Defendant did not get a response. (Id., ¶ 7.) On October 16, 2023,  Defendant served a third amended notice of deposition and set the deposition  for November 1, 2023. (Id., ¶ 7.) On November 1, 2023, Jackson again failed to  appear for the deposition or notify parties that they are not appearing.  Defendant took another Certificate of Non-Appearance. (Id., Exh. 3.)  The motion cannot be granted  because Defendant did not attach any deposition notice in order for this Court  to find Plaintiff Jackson was properly served with a deposition notice. As the  motion is denied, the request for sanctions is also denied.  Moving party to give notice
