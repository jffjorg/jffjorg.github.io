And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge on an expedited petition for approval of a minor's compromise. The petition was filed without a hearing, which is permitted under California Rules of Court, Rule 7.950.5, as long as the required Judicial Council forms are used and certain conditions are met. The settlement amount must not exceed $50,000. The court has reviewed the petition and declines to approve it as requested due to defects in the petition. Specifically, the court requests that the attorney provide a retainer agreement and that the total allowance for fees and expenses be filled out on the proposed order. The court schedules a hearing on the petition for April 15, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. in Department SS-30.
