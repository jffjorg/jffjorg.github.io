Ally Bank v. National
Transportation Inc., et al, 23STLC07523

Tentative decision on application for
writ of possession:  granted




 



Plaintiff Ally Bank seeks a writ of possession and turnover
order against Defendant National Transportation Inc. (“NTI”) to recover a 2017
Toyota Sienna with VIN 5TDJZ3DC2HS150149 (“Vehicle”).[1] 
The court has read and considered the moving papers (no
opposition was filed) and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of
the Case
1. Complaint 
On November 27, 2023, Plaintiff Ally Bank filed the
Complaint against Defendants NTI, John Eldon Kindt (“Kindt”), and Gleich for
(1) claim & delivery of personal property for pre-trial writ of possession
and order directing transfer of personal property and restraining order, and (2)
money due on a contract.  The Complaint
alleges in pertinent part as follows. 
Prior to this lawsuit, Ally Bank became and is now the owner
of a written contract (“Contract”) through written assignment, wherein
Defendant NTI purchased the Vehicle from Ally Bank’s assignor.  Compl., ¶6, Ex. A.  Ally Bank is now the holder of a first
priority security interest in the Vehicle. 
Compl., ¶7, Ex. B.
Defendant NTI is in default of the Contract by failing to
make the payment due and owing on February 27, 2022 in the sum of $460.16 or
any of the regular monthly payments of $460.16 due thereafter.  Compl., ¶8. 
Defendant NTI is in default of $22,507.51 in total.  Compl., ¶8.
 The Vehicle has not
been taken for tax, assessment or fine, or seized under an execution or
attachment against the property of Ally Bank. 
Compl., ¶10.  Defendants, and each
of them, claim to have some claim, right or interest in and to the Vehicle or
in the Contract.  Compl., ¶11.  Any such interest is subordinate to that of
Ally Bank.  Compl., ¶11.  Defendants have wrongfully detained the Vehicle
from the possession of Ally Bank. 
Compl., ¶11.
The J.D. Power report for November 2023 states the average
wholesale and retail values of the Vehicle is between $18,750 and $23,100.  Compl., ¶12, Ex. C.  Defendants are currently in possession of the
Vehicle and concealing it from Ally Bank. 
Compl., ¶13.  Prior to filing this
action, Ally Bank made a demand to Defendants for the surrender of possession
of the Vehicle.  Compl., ¶14.  Defendants have failed, refused, or neglected
to return possession of the Vehicle to Ally Bank.  Compl., ¶14.
Ally Bank has performed each and every obligation on its
part to be performed under the Contract. 
Compl., ¶15.
Ally Bank seeks recovery of the Vehicle, or its value in
case recovery cannot be had, a pre-trial writ of possession in favor, a
turnover order and an order preventing transfer of the Vehicle, and judgment
against NTI for $22,507.51 less any amounts to be credited for sale of the
Vehicle.  Compl., Prayer.
 
2. Course of Proceedings 
On May 29, 2024, Plaintiff Ally Bank filed proof of service
by personal service of the Complaint, Summons, and moving papers on Defendants
NTI and Gleich. 
On June 3, 2024, default was entered against Defendant NTI. 
 
B. Applicable Law
A writ of possession is issued as a provisional remedy in a
cause of action for claim and delivery, also known as replevin.  See
Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro v. Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279,
1288.  As a provisional remedy, the right
to possession is only temporary, and title and the right to possess are
determined in the final judgment.  
            A
writ of possession is available in any pending action.  It also is available where an action has been
stayed pending arbitration, so long as the arbitration award may be ineffectual
without provisional relief.  See CCP §1281.7. 
 
            1. Procedure
            Upon
the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, a plaintiff may apply
for an order for a writ of possession. 
Unlike attachment, where Judicial Council forms are optional, the
parties must use the mandatory approved Judicial Council forms in a claim and
delivery proceeding.  (Judicial Council
Forms CD-100 et seq.).
            A
plaintiff must make a written application for a writ of possession.  CCP §512.010(a), (b); (Mandatory Form
CD-100); CCP §512.010(a).  A verified
complaint alone is insufficient.  6
Witkin, California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §255, p.203.  The application may be supported by
declarations and/or a verified complaint. 
CCP §516.030.  The declarations or
complaint must set forth admissible evidence except where expressly permitted
to be shown on information and belief.  Id.
            The
application must be executed under oath and include: (1) A showing of the basis
of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of
the property claimed.  If the plaintiff's
claim is based on a written instrument, a copy of it must be attached; (2) A
showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, how the
defendant came into possession of it, and, the reasons for the detention based
on the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief; (3) A specific description
of the property and statement of its value; (4) The location of the property
according to the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief.  If the property, or some part of it, is
within a private place which may have to be entered to take possession, a
showing of probable cause to believe that the property is located there; and
(5) A statement that the property has not been taken for (a) a tax, assessment,
or fine, pursuant to a statute, or (b) an execution against the plaintiff’s
property.  Alternatively, a statement
that if the property was seized for one of these purposes, it is by statute
exempt from such seizure.  CCP
§512.010(b).
 
            2. The Hearing
            Before
noticing a hearing, the plaintiff must serve the defendant with all of the
following: (1) A copy of the summons and complaint; (2) A Notice of Application
and Hearing; and (3) A copy of the application and any supporting declaration.  CCP §512.030(a).  If the defendant has not appeared in the
action, service must be made in the same manner as service of summons and
complaint.  CCP §512.030(b).
            Each
party shall file with the court and serve upon the other party any declarations
and points and authorities intended to be relied upon at the hearing.  CCP §512.050. 
At the hearing, the court decides the merits of the application based on
the pleadings and declarations.   Id.  Upon a showing of good cause, the court may
receive and consider additional evidence and authority presented at the
hearing, or may continue the hearing for the production of such additional
evidence, oral or documentary, or the filing of other affidavits or points and
authorities.  Id.  
            The
court may order issuance of a writ of possession if both of the following are
found: (1) The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
plaintiff’s claim to possession of the property; and (2) The undertaking
requirements of CCP section 515.010 are satisfied.  CCP §512.060(a).  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is
more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the
defendant on that claim.”  CCP
§511.090.  This requires that the
plaintiff establish a prima facie case; the writ shall not issue if the
defendant shows a reasonable probability of a successful defense to the claim
and delivery cause of action.  Witkin,
California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §261, p.208.  A defendant’s claim of defect in the property
is not a defense to the plaintiff’s right to possess it.  RCA Service Co. v. Superior Court,
(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 1, 3.
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            The
successful plaintiff may obtain a preliminary injunction containing the same
provisions as a TRO that remains in effect until the property is seized by the
levying officer.[2]  CCP §513.010(c).  
            The
court may also issue a “turnover order” directing the defendant to transfer
possession of the property to the plaintiff (See Mandatory Form CD-120). 
The order must notify the defendant that failure to comply may subject
him or her to contempt of court.  CCP
§512.070.  The turnover remedy is not
issued in lieu of a writ, but in conjunction with it to provide the plaintiff
with a less expensive means of obtaining possession.  See
Edwards v Superior Court, (“Edwards”) (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 173,
178.
 
            3. The Plaintiff’s Undertaking
            Generally,
the court cannot issue an order for a writ of possession until the plaintiff
has filed an undertaking with the court (Mandatory Form CD-140 for personal
sureties).  CCP §515.010(a).  The undertaking shall provide that the
sureties are bound to the defendant for the return of the property to the
defendant, if return of the property is ordered, and for the payment to the
defendant of any sum recovered against the plaintiff.  Id. 
The undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of
the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.  Id. 
The value of the defendant's interest in the property is determined by
the market value of the property less the amount due and owing on any
conditional sales contract or security agreement and all liens and encumbrances
on the property, and any other factors necessary to determine the defendant’s
interest in the property.  Id.
            However,
where the defendant has no interest in the property, the court must waive the requirement
of the plaintiff’s undertaking and include in the order for issuance of the
writ the amount of the defendant’s undertaking sufficient to satisfy the
requirements of CCP section 515.020(b).  CCP
§515.010(b). 
 
C. Statement of Facts
Plaintiff Ally Bank owns the Vehicle pursuant to an
assignment of the Contract in which Defendants NTI and Gleich purchased the
Vehicle.  Singleton Decl., ¶5, Ex.
A.  Pursuant to the Contract, Ally Bank
has right to immediate possession of the Vehicle upon default of any provision
thereof.  Singleton Decl., ¶5, Ex. B.
Defendant NTI is in default of the Contract by failing to
make the payment due and owing on February 27, 2022 in the sum of $460.16 or
any of the regular monthly payments of $460.16 due thereafter.  Singleton Decl., ¶6.  Defendant NTI is in default of $22,507.51 in
total as of November 2, 2023.  Singleton
Decl., ¶6.  Ally Bank has made a demand
upon Defendant NTI for the surrender of possession of the Vehicle, but
Defendant NTI has failed to surrender it to Ally Bank.  Singleton Decl., ¶6.
The J.D. Power report is an industry-standard index listing
approximate values of motor vehicles. 
Singleton Decl., ¶7.  The J.D.
Power report for November 2023 states the average wholesale and retail values
of the Vehicle is between $18,750 and $23,100. 
Singleton Decl., ¶7, Ex. C.  Ally
Bank’s file reflects that Defendants are currently in possession of the Vehicle
and concealing it from Ally Bank. 
Singleton Decl., ¶8.  There is no
indication that the Vehicle has been taken on account of a tax, assessment or
fine, or seizure under an execution or an attachment against the property of
Ally Bank.  Singleton Decl., ¶9.

place of business is 1417 Madrid Ave Torrance CA, 90501.  Singleton Decl., ¶10.  This is the current location of the Vehicle.  Singleton Decl., ¶10.
 
D. Analysis
Plaintiff Ally Bank seeks
a writ of possession and turnover order for the Vehicle against Defendant NTI. No
opposition is on file and NTI is in default.
Ally Bank presents
evidence that it is the owner by assignment of the Vehicle from Banklease
Acceptance Corporation to Ally Financial, and from Ally Financial to Ally
Bank.  Singleton Decl., Ex. A.
Defendant NTI is in default of the Contract by failing to
make the payment due and owing on February 27, 2022 in the sum of $460.16 or
any of the regular monthly payments of $460.16 due thereafter.  Singleton Decl., ¶6.  The total owed is $22,507.51, as of November
2, 2023.  Singleton Decl., ¶6.  Ally Bank has made a demand upon Defendant
NTI for the surrender of possession of the Vehicle, but Defendant NTI has
failed to surrender it.  Singleton Decl.,
¶6.
Ally Bank fails to show a payment history or other
documentation to support the total owed of $22,57.51.  The declaration supporting a writ of
possession must be set forth with particularity.  CCP §516.030. 
A recitation of conclusions without a foundation of evidentiary facts is
insufficient.  See Rodes v.
Shannon, (1961) 194 Cal.App.2d 743, 749 (declaration containing conclusions
inadequate for summary judgment); Schessler v. Keck, (1956) 138
Cal.App.2d 663, 669 (same).  All
documentary evidence, including contracts and canceled checks, must be
presented in admissible form, and admissibility as non-hearsay evidence or
exception to the hearsay rule, such as the business records exception.  Lydig Construction, Inc. v. Martinez Steel
Corp., (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 937, 944; Pos-A-Traction, Inc.,
v. Kepplly-Springfield Tire Co., (C.D. Cal. 2000) 112 F.Supp.2d, 1178,
1182.  
As NTI fails to oppose, this defect is waived.  Ally Bank has established the probable
validity of its claim to possession of the Vehicle.  CCP §§ 511.090, 512.060(a).  
            The
undertaking required by CCP section 515.010(a) is an amount not less than twice
the value of the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater
amount.  Id.  The value of the defendant's interest in the
property is determined by the market value of the property less the amount due
and owing on any conditional sales contract or security agreement and all liens
and encumbrances on the property.  Id.  The average wholesale and retail values of
the Vehicle is between $18,750 and $23,100. 
Singleton Decl., ¶7, Ex. C.  Defendant
NTI owes $22,507.51 and the Vehicle’s retail value is $23,100.  Ally Bank’s undertaking will be $1184 (2 x $592).  The re-delivery bond will be $22,500.
Plaintiff Ally Bank’s file reflects that Defendant NTI’s
place of business is 1417 Madrid Ave Torrance CA, 90501.  Singleton Decl., ¶10.  This is the current location of the Vehicle.  Singleton Decl., ¶10.
 
E. Conclusion
The application for writ of possession and turnover order is
granted.  The levying officer may enter
Defendant NTI’s place of business at 1417 Madrid Ave Torrance CA, 90501 to
recover the Vehicle.  Ally Bank’s
undertaking will be $1184 and the re-delivery bond will be $22,500.  No order for writ of possession is on file
and Ally Bank is ordered to file it in the next two court days or it will be
waived.
