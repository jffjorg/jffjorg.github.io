B. Applicable Law
A writ of possession is issued as a provisional remedy in a
cause of action for claim and delivery, also known as replevin.  See
Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro v. Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279,
1288.  As a provisional remedy, the right
to possession is only temporary, and title and the right to possess are
determined in the final judgment.  
            A
writ of possession is available in any pending action.  It also is available where an action has been
stayed pending arbitration, so long as the arbitration award may be ineffectual
without provisional relief.  See CCP §1281.7. 
 
            1. Procedure
            Upon
the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, a plaintiff may apply
for an order for a writ of possession. 
Unlike attachment, where Judicial Council forms are optional, the
parties must use the mandatory approved Judicial Council forms in a claim and
delivery proceeding.  (Judicial Council
Forms CD-100 et seq.).
            A
plaintiff must make a written application for a writ of possession.  CCP §512.010(a), (b); (Mandatory Form
CD-100); CCP §512.010(a).  A verified
complaint alone is insufficient.  6
Witkin, California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §255, p.203.  The application may be supported by
declarations and/or a verified complaint. 
CCP §516.030.  The declarations or
complaint must set forth admissible evidence except where expressly permitted
to be shown on information and belief.  Id.
            The
application must be executed under oath and include: (1) A showing of the basis
of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is entitled to possession of
the property claimed.  If the plaintiff's
claim is based on a written instrument, a copy of it must be attached; (2) A
showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, how the
defendant came into possession of it, and, the reasons for the detention based
on the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief; (3) A specific description
of the property and statement of its value; (4) The location of the property
according to the plaintiff’s best knowledge, information, and belief.  If the property, or some part of it, is
within a private place which may have to be entered to take possession, a
showing of probable cause to believe that the property is located there; and
(5) A statement that the property has not been taken for (a) a tax, assessment,
or fine, pursuant to a statute, or (b) an execution against the plaintiff’s
property.  Alternatively, a statement
that if the property was seized for one of these purposes, it is by statute
exempt from such seizure.  CCP
§512.010(b).
 
            2. The Hearing
            Before
noticing a hearing, the plaintiff must serve the defendant with all of the
following: (1) A copy of the summons and complaint; (2) A Notice of Application
and Hearing; and (3) A copy of the application and any supporting
declaration.  CCP §512.030(a).  If the defendant has not appeared in the
action, service must be made in the same manner as service of summons and
complaint.  CCP §512.030(b).
            Each
party shall file with the court and serve upon the other party any declarations
and points and authorities intended to be relied upon at the hearing.  CCP §512.050. 
At the hearing, the court decides the merits of the application based on
the pleadings and declarations.   Id.  Upon a showing of good cause, the court may
receive and consider additional evidence and authority presented at the
hearing, or may continue the hearing for the production of such additional
evidence, oral or documentary, or the filing of other affidavits or points and
authorities.  Id.  
            The
court may order issuance of a writ of possession if both of the following are
found: (1) The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
plaintiff’s claim to possession of the property; and (2) The undertaking
requirements of CCP section 515.010 are satisfied.  CCP §512.060(a).  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is
more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the
defendant on that claim.”  CCP
§511.090.  This requires that the
plaintiff establish a prima facie case; the writ shall not issue if the
defendant shows a reasonable probability of a successful defense to the claim
and delivery cause of action.  Witkin,
California Procedure, (5th ed. 2008) §261, p.208.  A defendant’s claim of defect in the property
is not a defense to the plaintiff’s right to possess it.  RCA Service Co. v. Superior Court,
(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 1, 3.
            No
writ directing the levying officer to enter a private place to take possession
of any property may be issued unless the plaintiff has established that there
is probable cause to believe that the property is located there.  CCP §512.060(b).  
            The
successful plaintiff may obtain a preliminary injunction containing the same
provisions as a TRO that remains in effect until the property is seized by the
levying officer.[1]  CCP §513.010(c).  
            The
court may also issue a “turnover order” directing the defendant to transfer
possession of the property to the plaintiff (See Mandatory Form CD-120). 
The order must notify the defendant that failure to comply may subject
him or her to contempt of court.  CCP
§512.070.  The turnover remedy is not
issued in lieu of a writ, but in conjunction with it to provide the plaintiff
with a less expensive means of obtaining possession.  See
Edwards v Superior Court, (“Edwards”) (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 173,
178.
 
            3. The Plaintiff’s Undertaking
            Generally,
the court cannot issue an order for a writ of possession until the plaintiff
has filed an undertaking with the court (Mandatory Form CD-140 for personal
sureties).  CCP §515.010(a).  The undertaking shall provide that the
sureties are bound to the defendant for the return of the property to the
defendant, if return of the property is ordered, and for the payment to the
defendant of any sum recovered against the plaintiff.  Id. 
The undertaking shall be in an amount not less than twice the value of
the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.  Id. 
The value of the defendant's interest in the property is determined by
the market value of the property less the amount due and owing on any
conditional sales contract or security agreement and all liens and encumbrances
on the property, and any other factors necessary to determine the defendant’s
interest in the property.  Id.
            However,
where the defendant has no interest in the property, the court must waive the requirement
of the plaintiff’s undertaking and include in the order for issuance of the
writ the amount of the defendant’s undertaking sufficient to satisfy the
requirements of CCP section 515.020(b).  CCP
§515.010(b). 
 
C. Statement of Facts
On or about January 5, 2019, Defendants CaliFit and Patin
entered into a written Lease with the Dealer for the Vehicle.  McClurg Decl., ¶12, Ex. 1.  Defendants CaliFit and Patin agreed to pay
$618.20 plus taxes, commencing on January 5, 2019, and remaining payments due
on the 5th day of each month until January 5, 2023.  McClurg Decl., ¶13.  
Dealer assigned the Lease to Daimler Trust.  McClurg Decl., ¶14, Ex. 2.  On or about January 31, 2023, Daimler Trust
merged into Plaintiff MBVT Vehicle Trust. 
McClurg Decl., ¶17, Ex. 3. 
MBVT has performed all the conditions, covenants and
promises required under the terms of the Lease. 
McClurg Decl., ¶15.
On or about June 5, 2022, Defendants CaliFit and Patin
defaulted under the terms of the Lease by failing to make the required monthly
payments.  McClurg Decl., ¶16.  MBVT accelerated the Lease term and declared
all unpaid sums immediately due and payable. 
McClurg Decl., ¶16.
On or about January 5, 2023, Defendants CaliFit and Patin
failed to return possession of the Vehicle to MBVT.  McClurg Decl., ¶16.  Defendants CaliFit and Patin defaulted under
the Lease by abandoning the Vehicle and leaving it subject to a lien sale.  McClurg Decl., ¶16.  
MBVT demanded payment from Defendants CaliFit and Patin, but
they failed and refused to pay the balance of $34,622.35 plus the total monthly
payment of $676.93, now due and owing under the Lease.  McClurg Decl., ¶18, Ex. 4. 
On or about June 13, 2023, MBVT, Califit, and Patin were
notified by a Notice of Pending Lien Sale for Vehicle Valued $4000 or Less
(“Notice”) that German Tek was going to conduct a lien sale of the Vehicle on
July 10, 2023. The Notice stated that German Tek was claiming a lien against
the Vehicle for the following charges: lien sale cost ($70), repair costs
($250), towing costs ($585) and storage ($3,375, incurred at the daily rate of $225).
McClurg Decl., ¶19, Ex. 5.
German Tek did not seek prior approval from MBVt to take
possession of, and store, the Vehicle.  Nor
did MBVT give approval for the alleged storage fees incurred by German
Tek.  McClurg Decl., ¶20.
MBVT timely opposed German Tek’s Notice on June 13, 2023, and
is informed and believes that the DMV entered the opposition into DMV’s records
and placed a VLT stop (legal hold on title preventing further transfers) on
June 27, 2023.  MBVT is unaware of any
opposition to the lien sale application by Califit and Patin. McClurg Decl.,
¶21.
Prior to filing this action, MBVT and its counsel attempted
to negotiate the release of the Vehicle by offering German Tek the statutory
maximum sum of $1,275 ($250 in alleged repairs and $1,025 for storage) pursuant
to Civil Code section 3068.  German Teck refused
MBVT’s offer and has failed to release the Vehicle.   McClurg Decl., ¶22; Caley Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.  
German Tek is currently has custody, control and possession
of the Vehicle.  McClurg Decl., ¶25, Ex.
5. MBVT’s records reflecting conversations with Defendants Califit and Patin, and
with recovery adjusters, show that the Vehicle is presently located at Defendant
German Tek’s business of 5332 Topanga Canyon Blvd., Woodland Hills, CA, 91364.  McClurg Decl., ¶27.  Defendant German Tek refuses to surrender
possession of the Vehicle.  McClurg
Decl., ¶27.  
The Kelley Blue Book valuation of the Vehicle is
approximately $24,699.  McClurg Decl.,
¶28, Ex. 6.
Defendant German Tek’s interest in the Vehicle is $4,210 for
alleged repair, towing, and storage fees at the daily rate of $225 from May 24,
2023.  McClurg Decl., ¶29.  MBVT will be posting a bond as to German Tek
in the amount of $9,000, which is more than twice the amount of its interest,
and requests that German Tek be required to post a re-delivery bond in the sum
of $25,000.  McClurg Decl., ¶29.
 
D. Analysis
Plaintiff MBVT seeks
a writ of possession and turnover order for the Vehicle against Defendant
German Tek.  No opposition is on file.
MBVT presents
evidence that it owns the Lease and the Vehicle.  McClurg Decl., Ex. 2.  A body shop, German Tek, possesses the
Vehicle and MBVT has demanded the Vehicle at least
once to no effect.  McClurg Decl.,
¶27.  
            A
person performing repairs has a lien on a vehicle for the services and for
storage subject to limitations.  Civil
Code §3068(a).  The lien arises after a
written statement for charges is given to the vehicle’s registered owner or 15
days after the work or services are completed. 
Ibid.  
            A
lien in excess of $1500 for work performed, and in excess of $1025 for any
storage of the vehicle, is invalid unless written consent of the vehicle’s
legal owner or lessor was obtained before the work was performed or the storage
occurred.  Civil Code §3068(c)(1).  The term “legal owner” is defined as a person
holding a security interest in a vehcile which is subject to UCC.  Civil Code §3067; Vehicle Code §370.   The lien shall be extinguished if the
vehicle’s legal owner or lessor tenders, by cashier’s check or cash, the amount
for storage, safekeeping, or parking space rental to which the lienholder is
entitled under Civil Code section 3068(c). 

            The
lien is extinguished unless the lienholder either applies to the DMV for an
authorization to conduct the sale or files a court action within 30 days after
the lien arises.  Civil Code
§3068(b)(1)(A).  The lienholder shall
apply to the DMV for authorization to conduct a liens sale for any vehicle with
a value more than $4000.  Civil Code
§3071(a).  For a vehicle valued at $4000
or less, the lienholder shall apply to the DMV for the names and addresses of
the registered and legal owners and notify them of a pending lien sale.  Civil Code §3071(a), (b).  If the DMV receives a timely Declaration of
Opposition form, it shall notify the lienholder within 16 days of receipt of
the form that a lien sale shall not be conducted unless the lienholder files an
action in court within 30 days of the DMV’s notice.  Civil Code §3071(d).  Any lien sale shall be void if the lienholder
does not comply with this requirement. 
Civil Code §3071(l).
Defendant German Tek’s notice of
lien sale shows that Defendants Califit and Patin owe German Tek a lien
sale cost ($70), repair costs ($250), towing costs ($585) and storage ($3,375, incurred
at the daily rate of $225). McClurg Decl., ¶19, Ex. 5.  MBVT never
authorized or consented to these charges before they were incurred as required
by Civil Code section 3068(c)(1).  MBVT has
offered German Tek the statutory maximum repair and storage charges totaling the
statutory maximum sum of $1,275 ($250 in alleged repairs and $1,025 for
storage) pursuant to Civil Code section 3068 but German Tek has not accepted.  McClurg
Decl., ¶22; Caley Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.  German
Tek’s lien is therefore void.  Civil Code §3068(c); Universal CIT
Credit Corp. v. Rater, (1963) 214 Cal.App.2d 493, 495.
There is probable cause to believe
that the Vehicle is located at German Tek’s business of 5332 Topanga
Canyon Blvd., Woodland Hills, CA, 91364. 
McClurg Decl., ¶27.  MBVT may post
a bond as to German Tek in the amount of $9,000.  German Tek be required to post a re-delivery
bond in the sum of $25,000.[2]  
 
            E.
Conclusion
            The
application for a writ of possession and turnover order against Defendant
German Tek is granted.  A levying officer may enter German Tek’s address of 9625
South Alameda Street, Los Angeles, CA 90002 to seek possession of the
Vehicle.
