And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses several issues related to a Notice of Termination filed by Huang with the City. The City objects to Huang's request for judicial notice of certain documents, including a grant deed and City webpages. The judge grants these requests. The City also objects to Huang's reply evidence concerning his communications with Zraikat, citing improper evidence. The judge agrees, sustaining the City's objections. The judge also addresses Huang's argument that the City's interpretation of its own regulation should be given great weight, finding that the City's interpretation is inconsistent with its exercise of discretion. The judge also rejects Huang's argument that the City's revocation of approval was based on false or misleading information. Finally, the judge addresses Huang's claim that he proceeded with the Notice of Termination under the guidance of the Department, finding that the evidence presented does not undermine the conclusion that the City's decision was not arbitrary or lacking evidentiary support.
