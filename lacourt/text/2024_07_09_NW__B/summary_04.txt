The judge has granted the defendants' motion to continue the trial date from August 12, 2024 to January 13, 2025. The defendants had requested a continuance due to ongoing discovery and depositions, while the plaintiff had opposed the motion, arguing that the defendants had had sufficient time to prepare for trial. The judge found that there was good cause to continue the trial, citing the proximity of the present trial date and the need for parties to complete discovery and prepare for trial. The judge also granted the defendants' request to join the motion, and ordered that the final status conference be continued to January 3, 2025.
