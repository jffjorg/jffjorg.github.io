The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Terry M. Bluitt Salaam v. Marchand-Yanez Partners, L.P., et al. (Case No. 21STCV22469). The petition, filed on behalf of Terry M. Bluitt Salaam, seeks approval of a compromise of a pending action. The Judge has granted the petition, but has ordered the petitioner to submit an amended proposed order adjusting the amount of attorney's fees and the final settlement amount.

The Judge found that the proposed settlement is fair and reasonable based on the circumstances of the case. However, the Judge did not find that the amount of attorney's fees sought by counsel, $382,500.00, is reasonable. Instead, the Judge ordered that a 40% contingency fee, in the amount of $340,000, is reasonable and commensurate with the legal services rendered.

The Judge also ordered the petitioner to correct the information about the courthouse and department listed in the proposed order. The remaining balance of the settlement, $354,989.01, will be distributed to the conservator of the estate.
