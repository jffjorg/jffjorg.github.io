ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
On May 11, 2022, Plaintiff Mi Young
Kim (“Plaintiff”) filed a personal injury action against Defendant DK Sol
Vermont, Inc. dba Queen Spa and Sauna (“DK”) for general negligence and
premises liability.
 
On May 21, 2024, Defendant DK filed
the instant Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint. 
No opposition has been filed.
 
            On June 5,
2024, the matter was assigned to Judge Karen Moskowitz in Department B of the
Van Nuys Courthouse East.  Plaintiff was
ordered to give notice to all parties in this action within 10 days of service
of this notice and file proof of service thereof within 12 days of this
notice.  The Court notes that Plaintiff
has failed to file proof of service of the Notice of Case Reassignment.
 
II.                
Legal Standard
 
A demurrer is a pleading that may
be used to test the legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in the
complaint.  (Code of Civ. Proc. §
430.10.)  There are two types of
demurrers – general demurrers and special demurrers.  (See McKenney v. Purepac
Pharmaceutical Co. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 72, 77.)
 
General demurrers can be used to
attack pleadings for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action or for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e); McKenney,
167 Cal.App.4th at 77.)  Such
demurrers can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable;
evidence or extrinsic matters are not considered.  (Code of Civ. Proc. §§ 430.30, 430.70;
Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  For the
purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the Court admits “all material
facts properly pleaded” and “matters which may be judicially noticed,” but does
not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.
[Citation].”  (Blank, 39 Cal.3d at
318.)  It gives these facts “a reasonable
interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.”  (Ibid.). At the pleading
stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the
defendant of the factual basis for the claim against him.  (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal.
App. 3d 714, 721.)  The face of the
complaint includes exhibits attached to the complaint.  (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189
Cal.App.3d 91, 94.)  "If facts
appearing in the exhibits contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits
take precedence."  (Holland v.
Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447.). Special
demurrers can be used to attack the pleadings on grounds that the pleading is
uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible, or in a contract case, for failure to
allege whether a contract is oral or written. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(f).)
 
Moreover, Code of Civil Procedure
§ 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring
party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed
the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether
an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in
the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a).)  The parties are to meet and confer at least
five days before the date the responsive pleading is due.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(2).)  Thereafter, the demurring party shall file
and serve a declaration detailing their meet and confer efforts.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(3).)
 
When a demurrer
is sustained, the Court determines whether there is a reasonable possibility
that the defect can be cured by amendment. 
(Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  When a plaintiff “has pleaded the general set
of facts upon which his cause of action is based,” the court should give the
plaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint, since plaintiff should not “be
deprived of his right to maintain his action on the ground that his pleadings
were defective for lack of particulars.”  (Reed v. Norman (1957) 152 Cal.App.2d
892, 900.)  Generally, the court will
allow leave to amend on at least the first try, unless there is absolutely no
possibility of overcoming the issue.  (See
Angie M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227
("Denial of leave to amend constitutes an abuse of discretion unless the
complaint shows on its face it is incapable of amendment.  [Citation.] 
Liberality in permitting amendment is the rule, if a fair opportunity to
correct any defect has not been given.").)
 
III.             
Discussion
 
A.   
Meet and Confer Requirement
 
Defense counsel Edward W. Suh has submitted
a declaration regarding his attempts to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s
counsel.  On May 15, 2024, he called
Plaintiff’s counsel twice and left a voicemail; subsequently he sent an email
in an attempt to discuss potential issues in the Complaint.  (Suh Decl. ¶ 2.)  However, he did not receive any
response.  (Ibid.)
 
The Court finds the declaration
sufficient to satisfy the meet and confer requirement.
 
B.    
General Negligence and Premises Liability
 
a.     
Plaintiff’s Complaint
 
Plaintiff has filed a Form
Complaint against Defendant DK for general negligence and premises
liability.  However, the Complaint only
contains allegations regarding the premises liability cause of action.  The allegations set forth the following:
 
On 12/17/2019 plaintiff was injured
on the following premises in the following fashion (description of premises and
circumstances of injury): Plaintiff was injured when she lipped [sic] and fell
on a slipper [sic] substane [sic] inside the sauna and spa.  Defendant failed to clean the area and was
warned by Plaintiff that customers were using oil and other slipper [sic]
substances causing a dangerous condition at the sauna.  Defendant failed to maintain the area
properly, failed to stop its customers or control customers in the use of
slippery substances including oils.  This
failure was a direct cause of the accident. 
The accident took place at the Queen Spa and Sauna located at 932 S.
Vermont, Los Angeles, Calkfornia [sic] 90006[.]
 
The defendants who negligently
owned, maintained, managed and operated the described premises were (names): DK
SOL VERMONT, INC, dba Queen Spa and Sauna[.]
 
The defendant owners who willfully
or maliciously failed to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use,
structure, or activity were (names): DK SOL VERMONT, INC dba Queen Spa &
Sauna[.]
 
The defendants who were the agents
and employees of the other defendants and acted within the scope of the agency
were (names): Customers, employees and management of said sauna caused the
accident in failing to clean and maintain the premises propoperly [sic] Does
1-10.
The defendants who are liable to
plaintiffs for other reasons and the reasons for their liability are as follows
(names): Does 1 to 10, possible customers, employees, and management[.]
 
(Compl. p. 4.)
 
b.     
Defendant’s Demurrer
 
Defendant demurs to the Complaint’s
causes of action for personal injury and premises liability for failure to
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.  (Demurrer p. 3.)
 
Defendant argues that the Complaint
should be dismissed in its entirety as the statute of limitations for
Plaintiff’s claims had already expired when Plaintiff filed the lawsuit on May
11, 2022, more than 2.5 years after the incident took place.  (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiff has not opposed the
Demurrer.
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
§ 335.1, “[a]n action for assault, battery, or injury to, or for the death of,
an individual caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another” must be filed
within two years of the incident date. 
Here, Plaintiff filed the action on May 11, 2022, more than two years
since December 17, 2019, the date of the alleged injury.
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff
filed the action after the statute of limitations had expired and there is no
reasonable possibility that this defect can be cured by amendment.  Accordingly, Defendant’s Demurrer is
sustained without leave to amend.
 
IV.             
Conclusion & Order
 
For the
foregoing reasons,
 
Defendant DK
Sol Vermont, Inc.’s Demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
 
Moving party is
ordered to give notice.
