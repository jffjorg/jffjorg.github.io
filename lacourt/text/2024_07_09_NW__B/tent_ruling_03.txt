[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS 
 
Dept. B
1:30 p.m.
July 9, 2024



 
I.                  
BACKGROUND
 
On October 8, 2021, Plaintiff Fariba
Nourian filed a complaint against Defendants City of Los Angeles, The Gary
Michael Glushon and Kristan Ann Glushon Family Trust (the Trust), Gary Michael
Glushon, Kristin Ann Glushon, and Gary Michael Glushon and Kristan Ann Glushon
as Trustees of the Gary Michael Glushon and Kristin Ann Glushon Family Trust,
alleging causes of action for negligence and premises liability, arising out of
an alleged trip and fall on an uneven and/or raised and/or deteriorating
sidewalk.
 
On May 3, 2024, Defendant the
Trust filed this motion for judgment on the pleadings. No opposition has been
filed.
 
II.               
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
A defendant
may move for judgment on the pleadings where the court
has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action alleged in the
complaint or the
complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action
against that defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 438 subd. (c)(1)(B).)  A
non-statutory motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made any time before
or during trial.  (Stoops v. Abbassi (2002) 100
Cal.App.4th 644, 650.)  “Such motion may be made on the same ground as
those supporting a general demurrer, i.e., that the pleading at issue fails to
state facts sufficient to constitute a legally cognizable claim or
defense.”  (Ibid.)   
 
“In the construction of a pleading,
for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally
construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 452; see also Stevens
v. Superior Court (1999)
75 Cal.App.4th 594, 601.)  “When a court evaluates a complaint, the
plaintiff is entitled to reasonable inferences from the facts pled.”  (Duval
v. Board of Tr. (2001) 93
Cal.App.4th 902, 906.)  “In deciding
or reviewing a judgment on the pleadings, all properly pleaded material facts
are deemed to be true, as well as all facts that may be implied or inferred
from those expressly alleged.”  (Fire Ins. Exch. v. Superior Court (2004) 116
Cal.App.4th 446, 452.)  The grounds for a
motion for judgment on the pleadings must appear on the face of the challenged
complaint or be based on facts which the court may judicially notice. (§
438(d); Tiffany v. Sierra Sands Unified School Dist. (1980) 103
Cal.App.3d 218, 225.) A motion for judgment on the pleadings normally does not
lie as to a portion of a cause of action.  (Ibid.)  “In the case
of either a demurrer or a motion for judgment on the pleadings, leave to amend
should be granted if there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can
state a good cause of action.”  (Gami v. Mullikin Medical
Ctr. (1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 870,
876.)   
 
III.            
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant the Trust argues that the
complaint does not state sufficient facts against Defendant as it is not a
legal entity and cannot be sued. 
 
A trust estate is not a legal entity; it
is simply a collection of assets and liabilities.  As such, it has no
capacity to sue, be sued or defend an action. Any litigation must be maintained
by, or against, the executor, administrator or trustee of the estate. (Galdjie v. Darwish (2003) 113
Cal.App.4th 1331, 1344.)
 
Here, the complaint names “The Gary Michael Glushon and Kristan Ann
Glushon Family Trust” as a defendant. However, a trust is not a proper
defendant. Accordingly, the motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted
without leave to amend.
 
IV.            
CONCLUSION 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion for judgment on
the pleadings is
GRANTED without leave to amend.
The complaint against the Trust is DISMISSED.
Defendant is ORDERED to give notice.
