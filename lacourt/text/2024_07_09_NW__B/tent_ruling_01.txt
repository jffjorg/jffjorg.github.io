ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
            On June 16,
2021, Plaintiff Terry M. Bluitt Salaam (“Plaintiff” or “Salaam”) filed an
action against Marchand-Yanez Partners, L.P. (“Marchand-Yanez”), Paramount
Property Management (“Paramount”), and HPK Property Management, Inc. (“HPK”)
(collectively “Defendants”) for general negligence and premises liability.  The action arose from injuries sustained by
Plaintiff after she fell in her home.  On
April 17, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s son’s Application for Appointment
of Guardian Ad Litem on the basis that the injuries from the incident rendered
Plaintiff disabled and incompetent.
 
            On October
25, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement indicating that the parties
had reached a conditional settlement.  On
May 22, 2024, Petitioner Aquil Stanton filed the instant Petition for Approval
of Compromise of Claim or Action or Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor
or Person with a Disability, on behalf of Plaintiff Salaam.  An Amended Petition was filed on May 23,
2024.
 
            On June 5,
2024, the matter was assigned to Judge Karen Moskowitz in Department B of Van
Nuys Courthouse East.
 
            No
opposition has been filed.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
            Court approval is required
for all settlements of a minor’s claim or that of a person lacking the capacity
to make decisions.  (Prob. Code §§ 3500,
3600, et seq.; CCP § 372; Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th
1333, 1338.)  A person lacking “legal
capacity to make decisions…shall appear either by a guardian or conservator of
the estate or by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action
or proceeding is pending, or by a judge thereof, in each case.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 372(a)(1).)
 
A
petition for court approval of a compromise or covenant not to sue under CCP §
372 must comply with California Rules of Court 7.950, 7.951 and 7.952.  Accordingly, the petitioner must file a verified
petition for approval and disclose “all information that has any bearing upon
the reasonableness of the compromise.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 

 
An
order for deposit of funds of a minor or person lacking decision making
capacity and a petition for the withdrawal of such funds must comply with CRC
7.953 and 7.954.  (CRC, rule 3.1384; see
L.A. Sup.Ct. Rules 4.115-4.118.)
 
III.             
Discussion
 
Petitioner Aquil
Stanton seeks an order approving the proposed compromise of a pending action on
behalf of Claimant Terry M. Bluitt Salaam (“Salaam”), an adult with a disability.
 
If
approved, the action will settle in the total amount of $850,000.00.  Costs and expenses will be deducted from the
gross settlement as follows: $30,999.70 for medical expenses, $382,500.00 for
attorney’s fees, and $81,511.29 for other litigation costs.  The Petition indicates the existence of a
conservatorship of the estate of the adult with disability.  Thus, the remaining balance of the
settlement, in the amount of $354,989.01, will be distributed to the
conservator of the estate.
 
Having reviewed the
proposed settlement, the Court finds that the amount is fair and reasonable
based on the circumstances of the case and supporting documentation.  The Petition is also accompanied with
relevant medical records and documentation.
 
However, the Court does
not find that counsel’s declaration is sufficient to justify the amount of attorney’s fees sought, which amounts to $382,500.00
and represents 45% of the gross settlement amount Claimant is receiving.  Counsel explains that his team has
“vigorously litigated this very difficult and complex premises liability case”
for three years, which was been further complicated by Plaintiff’s pre-existing
medical history.  (Salamati Decl.)  Counsel has also enclosed a copy of a
spreadsheet listing the tasks and estimated time expended as Exhibit 1, which
demonstrates a total of 465.75 hours of work completed by his team.  (Ibid.).  Counsel adds that the 45% contingency fee is
reasonable because it was included in the fee agreement and the case was
extremely risky and heavily disputed.  (Ibid.)  The Court finds that a 40% contingency fee,
in the amount of $340,000, is reasonable and commensurate with the legal
services rendered.
 
While the settlement is fair and reasonable,
Petitioner is ordered to submit an amended proposed order adjusting the amount
of attorney’s fees and the final settlement amount to be awarded to Claimant.  Petitioner is also ordered to correct the
information about the courthouse and department listed in the proposed order.
 
IV.             
Conclusion
 
For the foregoing reasons,
 
The Petition to
Approve Compromise of Claim or Action for Minor or Person with a Disability,
filed on behalf of Terry M. Bluitt Salaam, is GRANTED.  Petitioner is ordered to file an Amended
Order, as discussed herein.
