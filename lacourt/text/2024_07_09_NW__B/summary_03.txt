And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the Defendant the Trust's motion for judgment on the pleadings, dismissing the complaint against it without leave to amend. The Trust argues that it is not a legal entity and cannot be sued, and the court agrees, citing California Code of Civil Procedure section 438 and relevant case law. The complaint names the Trust as a defendant, but a trust is not a proper defendant, and any litigation must be maintained by or against the executor, administrator, or trustee of the estate. The motion is granted without leave to amend, and the complaint against the Trust is dismissed.
