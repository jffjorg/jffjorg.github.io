ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
On August 3, 2021, Plaintiff Helen
Garcia (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendants Glendale Galleria
(“Galleria”), Millard Mall Services (“Millard”), and Massis Kabob (“MK”),
(collectively “Defendants”) for premises liability.  On March 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed an
Amendment adding Defendant Dunkin’ Donuts LLC (“Dunkin’ Donuts”) as Doe 1.  Plaintiff alleges that while walking in the
food court of the Galleria, she slipped and fell on an unknown substance and as
a result, sustained injuries.
 
On December 21, 2023, the Court
granted Plaintiff’s Request for Dismissal of Defendant International Grill,
Inc. (erroneously sued and served as Massis Kabob) as the parties had reached a
settlement.
 
On June 5, 2024, the matter was
assigned to Judge Karen Moskowitz in Department B of the Van Nuys Courthouse
East.  Plaintiff was ordered to give
notice to all parties in this action within 10 days of service of this notice and
file proof of service thereof within 12 days of this notice.  The Court notes that Plaintiff has failed to
file proof of service of the Notice of Case Reassignment.
 
On June 10, 2023, Defendant Dunkin’ Donuts filed the three
instant Motions:
 
(1)   Motion for Order Compelling Plaintiff
Helen Garcia to Answer Form Interrogatories Without Objections and for Monetary
Sanctions;
(2)   Motion for Order Compelling Plaintiff
Helen Garcia to Answer Special Interrogatories Without Objections and for Monetary
Sanctions;
(3)   Motion for Order Compelling Plaintiff
Helen Garcia to Answer Demand for Production of Documents Without Objections
and for Monetary Sanctions.
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard & Discussion
 
A.     Form and Special Interrogatories
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260(a).)  If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting
party may move for an order compelling response to the discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(b).)  Once compelled to respond, the party waives
the right to make any objections, including ones based on privilege or
work-product protection.  (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2030.290(a).)  There is no
time limit for a motion to compel responses to interrogatories other than the
cut-off on hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2024.020(a), 2030.290.)  No meet and confer efforts are required before
filing a motion to compel responses to the discovery.  (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)
 
On January 26, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff with Form
Interrogatories.  (Carey Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. A.)
 Plaintiff did not serve any
responses.  (Ibid. at ¶ 3.)  Defense counsel attempted to meet and confer
with Plaintiff’s attorney on March 8 and May 31, 2024.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 5-8, Exs. B-D.)  Defense counsel indicates that to date, Plaintiff
has not responded to the discovery request or second meet and confer attempt.  (Ibid. at ¶ 9.)  The Court finds that Defendant has demonstrated
that it has propounded form interrogatories on Plaintiff and Plaintiff has not
provided any responses.  Although
Defendant was not obligated to meet and confer with Plaintiff, defense counsel
has attempted to resolve the issue informally. 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s Motion for Order Compelling
Plaintiff’s Responses to Form Interrogatories.
 
Also on January 26, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff with
Special Interrogatories.  (Carey Decl. ¶
2, Ex. A.)  Plaintiff did not serve any
responses.  (Ibid. at ¶ 3.)  Defense counsel attempted to meet and confer
with Plaintiff’s attorney on March 8 and May 31, 2024.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 5-8, Exs. B-D.)  Defense counsel indicates that to date,
Plaintiff has not responded to the discovery request or second meet and confer
attempt.  (Ibid. at ¶ 9.)  The Court finds that Defendant has
demonstrated that it has propounded special interrogatories on Plaintiff and
Plaintiff has not provided any responses. 
Although Defendant was not obligated to meet and confer with Plaintiff,
defense counsel has attempted to resolve the issue informally.  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s
Motion for Order Compelling Plaintiff’s Responses to Special Interrogatories.
 
 
 
B.     Requests for Production
 
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.260(a).)  If a party to whom requests for production of
documents is directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting party
may move for an order compelling response to the discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(c).)  The party also waives the right to make any
objections, including ones based on privilege or work-product protection.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(a).)  There is no time limit for a motion to compel
responses to production of documents other than the cut-off on hearing
discovery motions 15 days before trial. 
(Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2024.020(a), 2031.300.)  No meet and confer efforts are required
before filing a motion to compel responses to the discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)
 
On January 26, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff with
Demand for Production of Documents. 
(Carey Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. A.) 
Plaintiff did not serve any responses. 
(Ibid. at ¶ 3.)  Defense
counsel attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s attorney on March 8 and
May 31, 2024.  (Ibid. at ¶¶ 5-8,
Exs. B-D.)  Defense counsel indicates
that to date, Plaintiff has not responded to the discovery request or second
meet and confer attempt.  (Ibid.
at ¶ 9.)  The Court finds that Defendant
has demonstrated that it has propounded requests for production on Plaintiff
and Plaintiff has not provided any responses. 
Although Defendant was not obligated to meet and confer with Plaintiff,
defense counsel has attempted to resolve the issue informally.  Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s
Motion for Order Compelling Plaintiff’s Responses to Demand for Production of
Documents.
 
C.    
Monetary
Sanctions
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2023.030(a) provides, in
pertinent part, that the court may impose a monetary sanction on a party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone because of that conduct.  Misuse of discovery includes “failing
to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(d)).
 
In addition,
Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2030.290 and 2031.300
authorize the Court to impose monetary sanctions if a party fails to respond to
interrogatories and requests for production.
 
Defendant Dunkin’ Donuts requests sanctions for the Motion for
Order Compelling Responses to Form Interrogatories in the amount of $613.00 as
follows: 1.5 hours for preparing the Motion and two (2) hours for the
anticipated reply and appearance at the hearing, at a billing rate of $158.00
per hour, plus $60 in filing fees.  (Carey
Decl. ¶ 11.)  Given that the Court grants the Motion,
Defendant is entitled to sanctions. 
However, as no opposition or reply papers have been filed, the Court
reduces the sanctions as follows: 1.5 hours for preparing the Motion and one
(1) hour for appearance at the hearing, at an hourly rate of $158, plus $60 in
filing fees, for a total amount of $455.
 
Defendant Dunkin’ Donuts requests sanctions for the Motion
for Order Compelling Responses to Special Interrogatories in the amount of
$534.00 as follows: one (1) hour for preparing the Motion and two (2) hours for
the anticipated reply and appearance at the hearing, at a billing rate of
$158.00 per hour, and $60 in filing fees. 
(Carey Decl. ¶
11.)  Given that the Court grants the
Motion, Defendant is entitled to sanctions. 
However, as no opposition or reply papers have been filed, the Court
reduces the sanctions as follows: one (1) hour for preparing the Motion and one
(1) hour for appearance at the hearing, at an hourly rate of $158, plus $60 in
filing fees, for a total amount of $376.
 
Defendant Dunkin’ Donuts requests sanctions for the Motion
for Order Compelling Responses to Demand for Production of Documents in the

hours for the anticipated reply and appearance at the hearing, at a billing
rate of $158.00 per hour, and $60 in filing fees.  (Carey Decl. ¶ 11.)  Given that
the Court grants the Motion, Defendant is entitled to sanctions.  However, as no opposition or reply papers
have been filed, the Court reduces the sanctions as follows: one (1) hour for
preparing the Motion and one (1) hour for appearance at the hearing, at an
hourly rate of $158, plus $60 in filing fees, for a total amount of $376.
