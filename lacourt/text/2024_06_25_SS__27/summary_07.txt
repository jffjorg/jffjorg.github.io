And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on several motions filed in the case. The first motion is filed by the plaintiff, who seeks to deem the defendant's responses to a request for admissions (RFA) admitted. The defendant argues that the responses were timely served, and the judge agrees, finding that the responses were provided well in advance of the hearing and that the plaintiff's counsel should have taken the motion off calendar.

The second motion is filed by the defendant, who seeks to strike certain allegations from the plaintiff's first amended complaint (FAC). The judge denies this motion, finding that the allegations are relevant and proper.

The third motion is filed by the plaintiff, who seeks to compel the defendant's deposition and requests sanctions. The judge grants this motion, ordering the defendant to sit for his deposition within 60 days and imposing sanctions in the amount of $2,204.00 on the defendant.

The judge notes that the parties should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue and that the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court if the parties neither submit nor appear at the hearing.
