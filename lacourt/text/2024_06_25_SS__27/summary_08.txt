And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the case. The dispute centers around the plaintiff's failure to obtain a default judgment against the defendant, despite multiple attempts. The judge finds that the dismissal was not caused by a mistake or neglect by the defendant's counsel, but rather by the overall conduct of the plaintiff's counsel throughout the case. The judge notes that the case was dismissed on November 8, 2023, and the motion for relief was filed more than six months later, which is outside the time limit for filing such a motion. Additionally, the judge notes that no proof of service was attached to the moving papers and that the proposed document to be filed was not included with the motion.
