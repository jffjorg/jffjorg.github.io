And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of GEVORG BADALYAN vs. BROOKFIELD PROPERTIES, granting the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages against Defendant Watch Zone. The court finds that the allegations in the complaint are not specific enough to support a claim of punitive damages against Watch Zone, as they are general and apply to multiple other defendants. The court also notes that the complaint lacks specific allegations regarding Watch Zone's knowledge or involvement in the matter. As a result, the court strikes the prayer for punitive damages without leave to amend.
