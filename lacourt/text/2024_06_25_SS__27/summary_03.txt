And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Watch Zone's motion to strike the prayer for punitive and exemplary damages from the complaint. The judge finds that the allegations in the complaint are not specific to Defendant Watch Zone and do not provide sufficient grounds for punitive damages against this defendant. The judge notes that the allegations apply to multiple other defendants and that there is no specific evidence to show that Defendant Watch Zone had any knowledge about the alleged misconduct of the employee of Helzberg Diamond who falsely accused Plaintiff of stealing jewelry. The judge also finds that Plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to show that the complaint can be amended to properly allege punitive damages against Defendant Watch Zone.
