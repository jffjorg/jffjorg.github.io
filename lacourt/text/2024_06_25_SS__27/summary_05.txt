And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the premises liability case against Albertsons Companies. The case was dismissed for failure to prosecute on November 17, 2023, but the plaintiff filed the present motion on May 10, 2024, within six months of the dismissal. The plaintiff's counsel states that the reason for not appearing at the hearing was due to counsel's assistant failing to properly set the alarm for the hearing, and therefore, he was not aware of the hearing and did not attend. The court finds that all requirements for mandatory relief have been met, and therefore, grants the present motion.
