COMPLAINT

Legal Standard 
 
A cross-complaint against any of
the parties who filed the initial complaint or cross-complaint against the
cross-complainant must be filed before or at the same time as the answer to the
initial complaint or cross-complaint, which answer must be filed within 30 days
of service of the complaint or cross-complaint.¿(CCP §§ 412.20(a)(3), 428.50(a), 432.10.)¿Any other cross-complaint may be
filed at any time before the court has set a trial date.¿(CCP §428.50(b).) 
 
If a party fails to file a
cross-complaint within the time limits described above, he or she must obtain
permission from the court to file the cross-complaint.¿(CCP §§ 426.50, 428.50(c).) The proposed
cross-complaint is mandatory when it arises out of the same transaction as
plaintiff’s claim. The court must grant leave to file the mandatory
cross-complaint absent bad faith. (Code Civ. Proc., § 426.50, Silver Organizations,
Ltd. v. Frank (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 94, 99.) Leave to file a permissive
cross-complaint need only be granted in the interest of justice. (CCP
§428.50(c).) Judicial policy generally supports the resolution of all disputed
matters between parties, leave to amend or leave to cross-complain is typically
granted liberally. (See Kolani v. Gluska (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 402,
412.) The Court may, however, deny such leave if there is demonstrated
prejudice to the opposing party, such as trial delays, loss of critical
evidence, or increased preparation costs. (Id.)¿ “Cross complaints for comparative equitable
indemnity would appear virtually always transactionally related to the main
action.” (Time for Living, Inc. v. Guy Hatfield Homes/All American
Develop. Co. (1991) 230 CA3d 30, 38.) 
California Rules of Court, Rule
3.1324 requires a copy of the proposed cross complaint to be attached to the
motion. 
 
Discussion
On May 4, 2022,
Plaintiff filed the present trip and fall case against Defendants. Through
discovery, Defendant Estrella learned that California Castle Properties was
responsible for maintaining the subject premises where the incident occurred
and where Plaintiff allegedly got injured. Defendant now moves the Court to
file a cross-complaint against Castle Properties for indemnity. Defendant’s
cross-complaint is mandatory as it arises out of the same transaction as the
original claim. Furthermore, no opposition was filed alleging prejudice.
Defendant also attached a copy of the proposed cross-complaint. All
requirements for leave have been met, and the Court hereby grants the present
motion.
