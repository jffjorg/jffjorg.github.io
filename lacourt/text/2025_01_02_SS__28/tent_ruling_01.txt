  Case Number:  19STCV20149    Hearing Date:   January 2, 2025    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving, opposition, objection, and reply papers, the Court rules  as follows.  BACKGROUND  A.   Previous proceedings  On June 10, 2019, Plaintiff Douglas Hart (“Plaintiff”)  filed this action against Defendants Alta Vista Gardens, Inc. (“Alta Vista”),  Konstantin Goldenberg (“Konstantine Goldenberg”), Faina Goldenberg (“Faina  Goldenberg”), City of Los Angeles (“City”), and Does 1-50 for dangerous  condition of public property and premises liability.  The complaint alleged that Alta Vista, Konstantin  Goldenberg and Faina Goldenberg were “corporations, partnerships, or other  business entities duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of  California . . . .”  (Complaint ¶ 3.)  On July 12, 2019, the City filed an answer.  On July 24, 2019, the City filed a  cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Konstantin Goldenberg, Faina  Goldenberg, Alta Vista, and Roes 1-25 for apportionment of fault,  indemnification, and declaratory relief.   On October 16, 2020, the Court dismissed Konstantin  Goldenberg, Faina Goldenberg, and Alta Vista from the cross-complaint without  prejudice at the City’s request.  On August 13, 2019, the Court entered the defaults of Konstantin Goldenberg and Faina Goldenberg on  Plaintiff’s complaint.  On August 26, 2019, Alta Vista filed a general denial  to Plaintiff’s complaint.  On October 28, 2019, Plaintiff amended the complaint  to include Defendants Fred Wasser as Doe 1, Wasser Keging as Doe 2, and Wasser  R. Fred Trust as Doe 3.  On February 20, 2020, the Court granted Plaintiff’s  motion for issue and evidentiary sanctions against Alta Vista and ordered that  (1) Alta Vista was precluded from introducing any evidence at trial and (2) the  issues of liability, causation, and damages were deemed adjudicated in favor of  Plaintiff and against Alta Vista.  On July 16, 2020, the Court dismissed the City without  prejudice at Plaintiff’s request.            On  August 20, 2020, Plaintiff waived jury trial.            On  November 6, 2024, Cross-Complainants Konstantin Goldenberg, Faina Goldenberg,  and Alta Vista filed a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendant City for  apportionment of fault, indemnification, and declaratory relief.  On December 10, 2020, the Court granted the  City’s motion to strike the cross-complaint.            On  November 16, 2020, Konstantin Goldenberg and Faina Goldenberg (who were in  default) filed an answer to Plaintiff’s complaint.            On  April 1, 2021, the case was assigned the Hon. Ernest Hiroshige in Department 70  at the Metropolitan Courthouse for a non-jury trial.  Judge Hiroshige addressed motions in limine  and heard testimony on April 1, 2, 5, and 6, 2021.            On June  29, 2021, Judge Hiroshige issued an interim order seeking clarification of  certain issues.  On August 30, 2021 and  September 2, 2021, Judge Hiroshige issued additional orders and directed  Plaintiff to submit a default prove-up package.            On  November 15, 2021, Judge Hiroshige issued a decision which concluded, “The  Court’s total verdict for the Plaintiff [against Alta Vista] is $1,608,000.00.”            On  December 13, 2021, Judge Hiroshige issued a tentative ruling denying  Plaintiff’s application for default judgment against Konstantin Goldenberg and Faina Goldenberg, reasoning  that Plaintiff’s complaint failed to allege that Konstantin Goldenberg and  Faina Goldenberg were liable to Plaintiff in their individual capacities.            On  January 14, 2022, Judge Hiroshige adopted the December 13, 2021 tentative  decision.  Judge Hiroshige stated:  “The Court will not ‘exercise its discretion’  – per the Plaintiff’s request – to rule that a proper ‘conforming to proof’  based on the evidence presented to the Court could award a Default Judgment[]  against the ‘individual’ Defendants Konstantin and Faina Goldenberg.”  The Court granted Plaintiff leave to file a first  amended complaint.            On  January 28, 2022, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint against Konstantin Goldenberg, Faina Goldenberg, and Does 1-50  for premises liability and negligence.            On  February 22, 2022, Judge Hiroshige entered a judgment in favor of Plaintiff against  Alta Vista for $1,608,000.00.            On  March 7, 2022, Konstantin Goldenberg and Faina Goldenberg filed an answer to  Plaintiff’s first amended complaint.  On  May 18, 2022, Konstantin Goldenberg and Faina Goldenberg filed a first amended  answer to the first amended complaint.            On  September 22, 2022, Plaintiff amended the first amended complaint to include  Defendants F. Ziatogorov Goldenberg as Doe 4, Staci Marmersthteyn as Doe 5, and  Jeffrey Gold as Doe 6.            On  February 15, 2023, the Court dismissed Konstantin Goldenberg, Faina Goldenberg,  F. Ziatogorov Goldenberg, Staci Marmersthteyn, and Jeffrey Gold with prejudice  at Plaintiff’s request.            On April  13 and 17, 2023, Alta Vista filed notices of appeal.  On October 5, 2023, the Court of Appeal dismissed the  appeal filed April 17, 2023.  On December  14, 2023, the Court of Appeal issued the remittitur.  On February 9, 2024, the Court of Appeal issued a  decision dismissing the appeal filed on April 13, 2023.  On April 18, 2024, the Court of Appeal issued  the remittitur.  B.   This motion  On September 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to  amend the February 22, 2022 judgment to add Staci Marmershteyn (“Marmershteyn”)  as Alta Vista’s alter ego.  The motion  was set for hearing on November 19, 2024.   On October 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for judicial notice in  support of the motion.  On November 12, 2024, Marmershteyn filed an opposition.  On November 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed an objection  to Staci Marmershteyn’s opposition.  (The Court exercises its discretion to consider the opposition.)  On  November 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply and another request for judicial  notice.  On November 18, 2024, Marmershteyn  filed a response to Plaintiff’s objection.   The Court continued the hearing to December 31, 2024.  REQUESTS  Plaintiff asks the Court to amend the February 22,  2022 judgment against Alta Vista by  adding Marmershteyn as Alta Vista’s alter ego.  Marmershteyn  asks the Court to deny the motion.  LEGAL STANDARD  “[A]  court has authority to impose liability under a judgment on an alter ego who  has control of the litigation.” (Misik v. D’Arco (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th  1065, 1075 (Misik), citing Alexander v. Abbey of the Chimes  (1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 39, 45 (Alexander).)  “Amendment of a judgment to add an alter ego  is a proper procedure where it can be shown that the alter ego of the corporate  entity had control of the litigation and was virtually represented in the  lawsuit.”  (Ibid.)  “ ‘[T]he  conditions under which the corporate entity may be disregarded vary according  to the circumstances in each case and the matter is particularly within the  province of the trial court. [Citations.] This is because the determination of  whether a corporation is an alter ego of an individual is ordinarily a question  of fact.’ ” (Misik, supra, 197 Cal.App.4th 1065, 1071-1072,  quoting Alexander, supra, 104 Cal.App.3d at p. 46.) “There are  two requirements for disregarding the corporate entity: first, that there is a  sufficient unity of interest and ownership between the corporation and the  individual or organization controlling it that the separate personalities of  the individual and the corporation no longer exist and, second, that treating  the acts as those of the corporation alone will sanction a fraud, promote  injustice, or cause an inequitable result.   [Citation.]  ‘Both of these  requirements must be found to exist before the corporate existence will be  disregarded, and since this determination is primarily one for the trial court  and is not a question of law, the conclusion of the trier of fact will not be  disturbed if it is supported by substantial evidence.’ ” (Id. at p. 1072, quoting Alexander, supra,  104 Cal.App.3d at p. 47.) “ ‘Code  of Civil Procedure section 187 authorizes a trial court to amend a judgment to  add judgment debtors.’ ”  (Misik, supra, 197 Cal.App.4th at p. 1072, quoting  Postal Instant Press, Inc. v. Kaswa Corp. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1510,  1517, fn. omitted.)  “The court may  exercise its authority to impose liability upon an alter ego who had control of  the litigation, and was therefore represented in it.” (Ibid.; see NEC  Electronics Inc. v. Hurt (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 772, 778-779 (NEC) [“  ‘[i]f the claim of individual liability is made at some later stage in the  action, the judgment can be made individually binding on a person associated  with the corporation only if the individual to be charged, personally or  through a representative, had control of the litigation and occasion to conduct  it with a diligence corresponding to the risk of personal liability that was  involved’ ”].)  “ ‘Control  of the litigation sufficient to overcome due process objections may consist of  a combination of factors, usually including the financing of the litigation,  the hiring of attorneys, and control over the course of the litigation.’ ” (NEC,  supra, 208 Cal.App.3d at p. 779, quoting 1A Ballantine & Sterling,  Cal. Corporation Laws (4th ed.) § 299.04, pp. 14-45-14-46, fn. omitted.)  “Clearly, some active defense of the  underlying claim is contemplated.”  (Id.  at p. 781.) It is not enough that an executive was “aware” of the litigation  action because “[s]urely every chief executive officer of a corporation is  cognizant of claims asserted against the corporation.”  (Ibid.)  “Code of Civil Procedure section 187 . . . does not require that the  ground for [a motion to add an alter ego] be alleged and  proved before entry of judgment.” (Misik, supra, 197 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1074-1075.)   “A court may amend its judgment so it  will properly designate the real defendants at any time [citation], including  after judgment [citation].”  (Id.  at p. 1075.)  PLAINTIFF’S REQUESTS FOR  JUDICIAL NOTICE  A.   Request filed October 29, 2024            Denied.  “ ‘It is  well settled that a court cannot take judicial notice of the truth of matters stated  in pleadings or affidavits in the court file of another case, although it can be  noticed that the documents exist.  Judicial  notice can be taken only of the contents of orders, findings of fact, conclusions  of law, and judgments.”  (Randy’s  Trucking, Inc. v. Superior Court of Kern County (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 818, 847,  fn. 19 [denying request for judicial notice because “defendants are offering  the documents for the truth of the statements made therein”].)  B.   Request filed November 15, 2024  Denied.  Plaintiff has not shown how the documents are  relevant to the alter ego issue in this case.  DISCUSSION  Plaintiff  asks the Court to find that Staci Marmershteyn is Alta Vista’s  alter ego because (1) she ran Alta Vista as its administrator, (2) as Alta  Vista’s current CEO, she handles Alta Vista’s “financials,” (3) Alta Vista is a  “a family owned company where Staci Marmershteyn  her father and mother ran the business” (Motion p. 6), (4) Alta Vista paid Staci  Marmershteyn’s mortgage and credit card bill, and (5) Staci Marmershteyn signed  declarations and verified discovery responses on behalf of Alta Vista in the  litigation.  Plaintiff  also argues that Alta Vista filed a bankruptcy petition on March 7, 2024 to  evade enforcement of the judgment and used corporate assets to defend the  action rather than tendering the case to its insurance carrier.  While Plaintiff asserts that Marmershteyn retained counsel for Alta Vista and made the decision not to tender Alta Vista's defense to its insurance carrier, Plaintiff has provided no evidence to support these assertions. Marmershteyn  opposes the motion, arguing (among other things) she did not control the  litigation for Alta Vista.  Plaintiff has not carried his burden of showing that Marmershteyn controlled  the litigation.  At most, Plaintiff has  shown that Marmershteyn was aware of the litigation  due to her role as chief operating officer (and later CEO) of Alta Vista and  signed declarations and verified discovery responses. This evidence  does not show that Marmershteyn “had control of the litigation and occasion to  conduct it with a diligence corresponding to the risk of personal liability  that was involved.’ ”  (See NEC, supra,  208 Cal.App.3d at pp. 778-779.)  The Court  denies Plaintiff’s motion.  CONCLUSION  The  Court DENIES Plaintiff Douglas Hart’s motion to amend the judgment to add Staci  Marmershteyn as the alter ego of Defendant Alta Vista Gardens, Inc.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
