And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge is considering the effect of the Probate case findings on the trial in this case and is requesting a report on how the UD case impacts this case. The judge notes that Maricela was appointed personal representative on August 4, 2021, prior to the mistrial on October 18, 2021, which was due to Ernesto, Jr. not having a personal representative at the time. The judge also acknowledges that the case was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but notes that the CRC six-month extension already takes into account this consideration. The parties are ordered to file their positions on the effect of the Probate case findings on the trial and to report on the impact of the UD case on this case.
