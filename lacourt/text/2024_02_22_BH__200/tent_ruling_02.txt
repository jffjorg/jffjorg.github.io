[1] For ease of reference, the Court refers to the
parties by their first names without intending any disrespect. 


[2] In fact, according to Ex. A to the notice filed
January 17, 2024, Maricela was appointed personal representative on August 4, 2021.
Significantly, this was prior to the mistrial on October 18, 2021 that was
based upon Ernesto, Jr. allegedly not then having a personal representative. 


[3] Though the Court cannot recall specifically that it
held this view when it was assigned the case previously, the Court believes it
may have conveyed that belief to the parties at that time. The Court cannot
rule out that it did not do so, notwithstanding there are not orders in the
record as to this issue. 


[4]   While through
a significant period of the time excluded it was also “impractical” to bring
the case to trial due to the difficulties of holding a jury trial due to COVID,
the CRC six-month extension already factors in this consideration.


[5] The parties are ordered to file before the status
conference their positions concerning what effect, if any, the findings in the
final statement of decision in the Probate case have on the trial in this case.
The Court also requests a report on the UD case and how that impacts this case.
