And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the OSC (Order to Show Cause) regarding the dismissal of the civil case. The case was filed in 2017, and there has been a significant delay in bringing it to trial. The judge has found that the five-year statute of limitations applies, and that the case should have been brought to trial within five years of the filing of the complaint. However, the judge has also found that there were circumstances that made it impossible to bring the case to trial within that time period, including the need to resolve the related Probate case first. As a result, the judge has decided to toll the statute of limitations only for a portion of the time, from April 23, 2023 to December 23, 2024, and has set a trial date for this year. The judge has also ordered that the case be tried this year and has set a trial setting conference to be held concurrently with the hearing on the OSC.
