TENTATIVE RULING
ON OSC RE: DISMISSAL 
Virginia Guzman v. Maricela
Guzman, et al., Case No. PC058067 (Related Case No. 17STPB11102)
Hearing Date:
February 22, 2024, 8:30 a.m. 
INTRODUCTION 
 
 
          This OSC
addresses whether a Civil case related to a Probate case was brought timely to
trial where there was significant delay in the Probate case going to trial.  
 
 
STATEMENT OF FACTS 
 
 
On October 26, 2017, Virginia filed a complaint in this
case against her sister Maricela and her husband Joe Diaz related to some
$41,900 she allegedly gave them for safekeeping.[1] 
 
On December 13, 2017, Virginia filed a petition in the
Matter of the Guzman Revocable Living Trust, Case no. 17STPB11102 (“the Probate
case”), against Maricela, her brother Ernesto, Jr. and sister Martha for
determination of the validity of that trust and as to ownership of real
property located at 339/341 W. Garfield Avenue in Glendale. 
 
On August 31, 2018, Maricela and her brother Ernesto, Jr.
and sister Martha filed a cross-complaint in this case, contending that the sums
in question were rental payments by Virginia for the real property the
ownership of which was the subject of the Probate case. The Court continues the
trial date of November 13, 2018 to February 4, 2019. 
 
On December 27, 2018, Dept.1 of the Court ruled that this
case was related to the Probate case (to which the Court had previously related
an unlawful detainer case, Case No. 18PDUD00396, against Virginia concerning
possession of this property.) The civil case was sent to Dept. 3 at the Mosk
courthouse where the undersigned was at the time assigned in a Probate
courtroom. 
 
On June 14, 2019, at a status conference, the Court (by
the undersigned) set both cases for trial on November 12, 2019. 
 
On November 12 and 26, 2019, trial was continued to ultimately
February 14 2020 by stipulation due to medical reasons of counsel for Virginia.

 
On February 21, 2020, the Court (by now Judge Paul Suzuki)
continued trial to July 24, 2020. 
 
On July 24, 2020, trial was continued to August 21, 2020
due to failure of counsel for Virginia to appear. Counsel advised the Court
that Ernesto, Jr. had passed away. 
 
On August 21, 2020, a request for a jury trial was made
and trial was continued to September 4, 2020 for a hearing on a motion for
summary judgment. 
 
On September 18, 2020, the Court permits a trial by jury
and sets a trial setting conference on January 15, 2021. 
 
On January 15, 2021, the Court sets a jury trial date of October
18, 2021. 
 
On October 18, 2021, the Court took the civil trial off
calendar (due to the request for jury trial) and proceeded to the bench trial
of the Probate case. The Court declared a mistrial of the trial in the Probate
case. The case could not proceed as Ernesto, Jr. had passed away, was an
interested party and required the appointment of a personal representative. Trial
that had been scheduled to start October 19, 2021 was re-set as a non-jury
trial for July 27, 2022.  
 
On June 24, 2022, the Court (by now Judge Ana Maria Luna)
continued the July 27, 2022 trial date to April 4, 2023. 
 
On February 9, 2023, this case and the Probate case were reassigned
to the undersigned for trial in Dept. 200 of the Beverly Hills courthouse where
he was by then assigned. 
 
On February 24, 2023, at a status conference of both
cases, this Court vacated the trial dates, given there was no answer on file to
the cross-complaint, and indicated that trial of the Probate case would be
conducted prior to the trial in this case. 
 
On March 15, 2023, Virginia filed an answer to the
cross-complaint herein. 
 
On April 3, 4, 5 and 6, 2023, this Court conducted trial
of the Probate case. 
 
On July 24, 2023, in the Probate case, this Court
overruled the Objections to the Tentative Statement of Decision, filed May 23,
2023, adopted the Tentative as its Final Statement of Decision and dismissed with
prejudice the petition filed December 13, 2017 as untimely filed. 
 
On October 5, 2023, at a status conference herein, the
Court issued OSCs re: failure of counsel for Virginia to appear and concerning
bringing this case to trial and set those for hearing on November 9, 2023. 
 
On November 9, 2023, the Court discharged the OSC re:
failure to appear and continued this OSC for January 10, 2024 and briefing
beforehand. 
 
On November 27, 2023, Virginia filed a brief and
supporting declaration of counsel in response to the OSC. 
 
On January 9, 2024, Maricela filed a brief and supporting
declarations in response to Virginia’s brief responding to the OSC. 
 
On January 10, 2024 the Court continued the OSC to
February 22, 2024 due to the late filing of the response. 
 
On January 23, 2024, Virginia filed a reply brief. Virginia
contends that a personal representative for Ernesto, Jr. was not appointed
until just last week on January 17, 2024.[2] 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
          Virginia
contends, in the alternative, that the time within which to bring this case to
trial is not until October 18, 2024, three years after the mistrial in the
Probate case, or not until May 2027 because the Court’s decision to try the
Probate case before this case made it impossible for her to bring this case to
trial from December 2018 when the cases were related through April 2023 when
the Probate case was tried. 
 
          Maricela
contends that the five-year statute, not the three-year statute, is applicable
as the mistrial was in the Probate case, not this case. In turn, Maricela
contends there has been no stay or other tolling of the five-year statute. Maricela
contends that this case must be dismissed as the five years and six months
expired on or about April 26, 2023.  
 
CCP sec. 583.310 requires that an action be brought to
trial within five years. 
 
Rule 10(a) of the Rules of Court adds six months to the
five years. 
 
CCP sec. 583.320 provides, however, in relevant part that
if a trial has commenced but no judgment is entered because of a mistrial that
the action be brought to trial within three years of the order declaring a
mistrial.  
 
CCP sec. 583.340 provides in relevant part that in computing
the time within an action shall be brought to trial there shall be excluded when
bringing the action to trial if it was (b) stayed or enjoined or (c) it was “impossible,
impracticable, or futile” to do so. 
 
         
Initially, contrary to Virginia’s claim, this case was not consolidated
with the Probate case and arguments based upon that assumption are rejected. The
cases were merely related so they could be managed by one judge. Hence, the
Court does not find that the mistrial in the Probate case makes this case
subject to the three-year statute. The effect of that decision was merely that
the Probate trial would need to be heard again and therefore the time for the
petition in that case to be brought to trial would need to then be pursuant to the
three-year statute. Since this case was not tried with the Probate case, it
would not make sense to extend the time within which it needed to be brought to
trial. Moreover, as a collateral matter, it now appears that the basis for the
mistrial may have been in error: Ernesto, Jr. already had a personal
representative.  
 
         
Therefore, the Court now addresses application of the five-year statute:
The Court did not per se stay or enjoin trial in this case. However, this bench
officer at least believed that it did not make sense to try this related civil
case until a decision was made in the Probate case as the facts at issue herein
depended upon how the facts in the Probate case were decided:[3] If
Virginia was in fact a part owner of the property, the contention of the
cross-complaint that she would have been paying rent would likely not make
sense. By contrast, if Virginia was not the owner, her making rental payments
might make sense. Moreover, where Virginia had requested a jury trial, normal
procedure would have required the bench trial be decided before any jury trial.
This civil case would have “trailed” the Probate case. In turn, it appears
Judge Suzuki also believed that the Probate case needed to be tried first as
that is what he did by delaying the civil trial and attempting to proceed
forward with trial of the Probate case. As a result, the Court finds that on
some level it was “impossible” for purposes of CCP sec. 583.340, to bring this
civil case to trial pending conclusion of the trial of the Probate case. Following
that theory, the Court could conceivably exclude from the time within which
Virginia needed to have brought this case to trial from when this Court first
held a status conference on June 14, 2019 to July 24, 2023. 
 
          On the
other hand, trial of the Probate case was delayed significantly, including by
reason of a seemingly unnecessary mistrial. Further, the record indicates
several continuances were due to counsel for Virginia not appearing at hearings.
Virginia should not be wholly excused from moving forward with this case for
this entire time and thereby unreasonably extend resolution of this case. Notably,
this case also could not proceed to trial because Virginia had not filed an
answer to the cross-complaint. This should have been done and was within the
control of Virginia and counsel regardless of the status of the Probate case. Similarly,
there has not been compliance yet with filing of the documents required before
trial, including joint witness and exhibit lists, proposed jury instructions,
if applicable, and trial briefs. Therefore, the Court intends to allow tolling
only for some of this time, given that the Court had never excused Virginia from
moving forward with this case due to the Probate case or imposed a stay on all
proceedings in this case and Virginia could have avoided some of this delay. (See
discussion of relevant considerations in Gaines v. Fidelity Nat’l. Title
Ins. Co. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 1081 and ability of court to determine
for what periods there should be tolling) The Court therefore exercises its
discretion, consistent with the policy of hearing cases on the merits, to extend
the statute expiration only from April 23, 2023 to December 23, 2024, not the
entire time the case was waiting resolution of the Probate case.[4] In
this way, defendants can be assured this case will be tried this year. The
Court will set a trial date at the trial setting conference concurrent with the
hearing on this OSC.[5] 

CONCLUSION 
 
          For these
reasons, the Court discharges the OSC.
