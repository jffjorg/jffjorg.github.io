BACKGROUND
 
            On April
19, 2019, Plaintiff Cynthia Shelton filed the Complaint against Defendants Los Angeles World
Airports and the City of Los Angeles, alleging causes of action for negligence,
willful failure to warn, and dangerous conditions of public property arising
from a fall at Los Angeles International Airport.

LEGAL STANDARD
 
            The function of a
motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to
whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or
claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 437 subdivision (c) “requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the
pleadings.” (Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67,
citing FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367,
381-382.)  
 
As to each cause of action, as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication
must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that one
or more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be established, or that
there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c
subd. (p)(2); see also Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of
the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence
in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39
Cal.4th 384, 389.)  
 
Once the defendant has met that burden, the
burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. To
establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must
produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)  
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            This
case arises from a fall that occurred on a stairwell in the Tom Bradley
International Terminal at Los Angeles International Airport. On July 30, 2018,
Plaintiff flew from San Salvador, El Salvador, to Los Angeles on Avianca
Airlines. After deplaning, she proceeded toward the baggage claim area. On her
way, she encountered a broken-down escalator and was allegedly ushered toward
an adjacent stairwell. Unfortunately, as she descended the stairs and was
approximately three to four steps from the bottom, she fell. (UMF 1.)
 
Plaintiff subsequently filed a premises
liability lawsuit against the Defendants, alleging they were responsible for
her fall. Plaintiff asserts that the Defendants negligently owned, maintained,
managed, and operated the stairwell and further alleges that they willfully or
maliciously failed to guard or warn against the dangerous condition that led to
her injury.
 
 
            Cause of Action 1 – Negligence
 
            “To state a cause of action for
negligence, a plaintiff must allege (1) the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty
of care, (2) the defendant breached that duty, and (3) the breach proximately
caused the plaintiff's damages or injuries.” (Lueras v. BAC Home Loans
Servicing, LP (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 49, 62.) 
 
            Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s
claim of common law negligence against the Defendants is barred. Plaintiff
alleges that the Defendants negligently owned, maintained, managed, and
operated the premises where she fell. However, the California Government
Claims Act eliminates common law tort liability for public entities and
employees. (Gov. Code § 815.) The Government Claims Act states that public
entities can only be held liable for injuries if liability is explicitly
provided by statute and not based on common law tort principles. (Gov. Code §
815 subd. (a); See, Quigley v. Garden Valley Fire Prot. Dist. (2019) 7
Cal. 5th 798, 803; Guzman v. Cnty. of Monterey (2009) 46 Cal. 4th 887,
897.)
 
As
both Defendants are public entities, any tort liability related to the
stairwell must be based exclusively on § 835 of the Government Claims Act. (Gov.
Code § 835.) Consequently, Plaintiff’s first count for common law negligence is
legally barred and must be dismissed.
 
Plaintiff
does not specify her arguments as to each cause of action but instead provides
one full response. Plaintiff argues that Defendants, as owners and operators of
public property, had a duty to maintain their premises in a reasonably safe
condition for the public, particularly for individuals using the escalators and
stairwells at the airport. Plaintiff references Phifer v. Iceland Air (S.D.N.Y.
2019), which Plaintiff argues holds that airlines and related entities,
including airports, are responsible for injuries occurring during
disembarkation. Plaintiff contends that Defendants failed this duty by leaving
the escalator inoperative and not providing adequate crowd control or warnings.
Additionally, Plaintiff cites Niemiec v. Polar Air Cargo, LLC (E.D.N.Y.
2009), which Plaintiff argues states that airport operators are responsible for
ensuring safe passage for passengers. Here, Plaintiff argues that Defendants
neglected its responsibility to warn passengers of potential hazards and
control the crowd, thereby creating unsafe conditions that led to her injuries.
However, the Court could locate neither of these cases. The Court was able to
locate a case titled Phifer v. Icelandair, from the Ninth Circuit, which
found that an airline was liable to a passenger for an injury sustained after
hitting her head on a television while boarding the aircraft. (Phifer v.
Icelandair (9th Cir. 2011) 652 F.3d 1222, 1224.)
 
Furthermore,
Plaintiff argues that her fall was an unexpected and unusual event caused by
unsafe external conditions, which qualifies as an "accident" under
the Montreal Convention. Plaintiff asserts that an "accident" under
the Convention is defined as an unexpected or unusual event external to the
passenger, and the push she experienced, which caused her fall, meets this
definition, making Defendants liable. (Air France v. Saks (1985) 470 U.S. 392, 405.)
 Plaintiff also references McCaskey v.
Continental Airlines, Inc. (5th Cir. 2004), in which she argues a
passenger's injury caused by another during disembarkation was deemed an
"accident." In Plaintiff's case, her injury resulted from being
pushed by another passenger in a crowded, unmanaged stairwell, further
supporting her claim of liability under the Montreal Convention. Again, the
Court had issues locating Plaintiff’s cited cases. The Court could not find a
case named McCaskey v. Continental Airlines, Inc. from the Fifth
Circuit. The Court did locate McCaskey v. Continental Airlines, Inc.
(S.D. Tex. 2001) 133 F.Supp.2d 514, however, it does not hold what Plaintiff
has asserted. (McCaskey v. Continental Airlines, Inc. (S.D. Tex. 2001)
133 F.Supp.2d 514.)
 
Last,
Plaintiff does not provide a response to the Separate Statement of Undisputed
Material Facts but does argue that several material facts remain in dispute,
including whether Defendants had knowledge of the broken escalator and failed
to adequately warn passengers, whether they provided sufficient crowd control
and assistance, and whether Plaintiff's fall was directly caused by Defendants'
negligence in maintaining safe premises. Plaintiff contends that these
unresolved issues are central to determining whether Defendants fulfilled their
duty of care and whether their actions or inactions contributed to her injury.
 
Here,
Defendants have met their burden of showing that Plaintiffs' claim for
negligence is barred by the Government Claims Act. (Gov. Code § 815 subd. (a).)
Plaintiff has provided cases that show airlines may be held liable for their
negligence, but none showing that government-owned airports can. Furthermore,
Defendant has provided no evidence which shows a triable issue of material
fact.
 
Therefore,
the Court grants the Motion for Summary Judgement as to cause of action one.
 
            Cause of Action 2 – Willful
Failure to Warn
 
            The Second cause of action asserts a count for willful
failure to warn under California Civil Code § 846. 
            
            Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s claim of willful failure
to warn, based on California Civil Code § 846, is inapplicable to public
entities like the City Defendants. (Civ. Code, § 846.) Plaintiff alleges that
Defendants willfully or maliciously failed to warn of the dangerous condition
of the stairwell where she fell. However, Defendants assert that liability for
public entities regarding the condition of public property is governed
exclusively by the Government Claims Act, specifically § 835, which covers
dangerous conditions on public property. (Gov. Code § 835.) Defendants argue
that § 846 applies only to private property owners who grant access for
recreational purposes and does not apply to public entities or commercial
travel, such as the incident involving Plaintiff. (Civ. Code § 846.)
Furthermore, Defendants argue that the Court has explicitly rejected the use of
§ 846 to impose liability on public entities. (Delta Farms Reclamation Dist.
v. Superior Court (1983) 33 Cal. 3d 699, 704-06.) Since the stairwell
is public property maintained by Los Angeles World Airports, a proprietary
department of the City of Los Angeles, Defendants argue that § 846 cannot be
used to hold them liable. Therefore, they contend that Plaintiff’s second count
for willful failure to warn is barred by law and must be dismissed.
 
Again,
Plaintiff does not specify her arguments as to each cause of action but instead
provides one full response. Plaintiff argues that Defendants, as owners and
operators of public property, had a duty to maintain their premises in a
reasonably safe condition for the public, particularly for individuals using
the escalators and stairwells at the airport. Plaintiff references Phifer v.

providing adequate crowd control or warnings. Additionally, Plaintiff cites Niemiec

conditions that led to her injuries. However, the Court could locate neither of

to a passenger for an injury sustained after hitting her head on a television
while boarding the aircraft. (Phifer v. Icelandair (9th Cir. 2011) 652
F.3d 1222, 1224.)
 
Furthermore,
Plaintiff argues that her fall was an unexpected and unusual event caused by
unsafe external conditions, which qualifies as an "accident" under
the Montreal Convention. Plaintiff asserts that an "accident" under
the Convention is defined as an unexpected or unusual event external to the
passenger, and the push she experienced, which caused her fall, meets this
definition, making Defendants liable. (Air France v. Saks (1985) 470 U.S. 392,
405.)  Plaintiff also references McCaskey

and assistance, and whether Plaintiff's fall was directly caused by Defendants'
negligence in maintaining safe premises. Plaintiff contends that these
unresolved issues are central to determining whether Defendants fulfilled their
duty of care and whether their actions or inactions contributed to her injury.
 
Here,
Defendants have met their burden of showing that Plaintiff’s claim for willful
failure to warn is barred by the Government Claims Act. (Civ. Code, § 846; Delta
Farms Reclamation Dist., supra, 33 Cal. 3d 699, 704-06.) Plaintiff has
provided no evidence to show that Defendants can be held liable for willful
failure to warn under California Civil Code § 846.
 
Therefore,
the Court grants the Motion for Summary Judgement as to cause of action two.
            
Cause
of Action 3 – Dangerous Condition of Public Property
 
            A public entity may be liable for a dangerous
condition of public property if the property was in a dangerous condition at
the time of the injury, the dangerous condition caused the injury, the
condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the type of injury that
occurred, and either a negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee
within the scope of their employment created the condition, or the public
entity had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition in
sufficient time to take measures to protect against it. (Gov. Code § 835; Sun
v. City of Oakland (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 1177, 1183.)
 
            Defendants argue that a dangerous
condition is defined as one that presents a substantial risk of injury when the
property is used with due care. Allegations must identify specific physical
deficiencies, such as damage or defects, rather than a general lack of
safeguards. (Brenner v. City of El Cajon, (2003) 113 Cal. App. 4th 434,
439.) Defendants assert that Plaintiff's claims lack specificity regarding any
physical defect or dangerous condition of the stairwell. In this case,
Plaintiff did not provide evidence of any physical defect on the stairwell, as
it was clean, dry, and well-lit at the time of the incident. (UMF Nos. 4-6.)
Defendants contend that the lack of crowd control or signage alone does not
constitute a dangerous condition under the statute, and without evidence of a
physical defect, Plaintiff's claim cannot succeed. (See, Davis v. City of
Pasadena (1996) 42 Cal. App. 4th 701, 702-03; Brenner, supra, 113
Cal. App. 4th 434, 439.)  Therefore,
Defendants argue that Plaintiff's case should be dismissed.
 
            Furthermore, Defendants argue that
Plaintiff's claim that a crowd of passengers in the stairwell constituted a
dangerous condition due to Defendants’ failure to control the crowd is legally
insufficient. They assert that third-party conduct alone, unrelated to the physical
condition of the property, does not constitute a dangerous condition for which
a public entity may be held liable. (Zelig v. Cnty. of Los Angeles (2002)
27 Cal. 4th 1112, 1135-36; Moncur v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 68
Cal. App. 3d 118, 121.) Since Plaintiff does not allege or provide
evidence of any physical defect or deterioration in the stairwell, Defendants
argue that the third-party conduct is insufficient to establish liability.
 
Defendants
also argue that the lack of crowd control or supervision does not amount to a
dangerous condition, as courts have consistently ruled that without a physical
defect in the property, the failure to impose additional security measures,
such as crowd control, does not create a dangerous condition. (See, Hacala
v. Bird Rides, Inc. (2023) 90 Cal. App. 5th 292, 300-301; Gray v.
America West Airlines, Inc. (1989) 209 Cal. App. 3d 76, 79-80.)
Since the stairwell had no physical defect and Plaintiff’s claim relies solely
on third-party actions, Defendants conclude that the claim for dangerous
condition of public property should be dismissed as a matter of law. 
 
Again,
Plaintiff does not specify her arguments as to each cause of action but instead
provides one full response. Plaintiff argues that Defendants, as owners and
operators of public property, had a duty to maintain their premises in a
reasonably safe condition for the public, particularly for individuals using
the escalators and stairwells at the airport. Plaintiff references Phifer v.
Iceland Air (S.D.N.Y. 2019), which Plaintiff argues holds that
airlines and related entities, including airports, are responsible
for injuries occurring during disembarkation. Plaintiff contends that
Defendants failed this duty by leaving the escalator inoperative and not
providing adequate crowd control or warnings. Additionally, Plaintiff cites Niemiec
v. Polar Air Cargo, LLC (E.D.N.Y. 2009), which Plaintiff argues states that
airport operators are responsible for ensuring safe passage for passengers. Here,
Plaintiff argues that Defendants neglected its responsibility to warn
passengers of potential hazards and control the crowd, thereby creating unsafe
conditions that led to her injuries. However, the Court could locate neither of
these cases. The Court was able to locate a case titled Phifer v.
Icelandair, from the Ninth Circuit, which found that an airline was liable
to a passenger for an injury sustained after hitting her head on a television
while boarding the aircraft. (Phifer v. Icelandair (9th Cir. 2011) 652
F.3d 1222, 1224.)
 
Furthermore,
Plaintiff argues that her fall was an unexpected and unusual event caused by
unsafe external conditions, which qualifies as an "accident" under
the Montreal Convention. Plaintiff asserts that an "accident" under
the Convention is defined as an unexpected or unusual event external to the
passenger, and the push she experienced, which caused her fall, meets this
definition, making Defendants liable. (Air France v. Saks (1985) 470 U.S. 392,
405.)  Plaintiff also references McCaskey
v. Continental Airlines, Inc. (5th Cir. 2004), in which she argues a
passenger's injury caused by another during disembarkation was deemed an
"accident." In Plaintiff's case, her injury resulted from being
pushed by another passenger in a crowded, unmanaged stairwell, further
supporting her claim of liability under the Montreal Convention. Again, the
Court had issues locating Plaintiff’s cited cases. The Court could not find a
case named McCaskey v. Continental Airlines, Inc. from the Fifth
Circuit. The Court did locate McCaskey v. Continental Airlines, Inc.
(S.D. Tex. 2001) 133 F.Supp.2d 514, however, it does not hold what Plaintiff
has asserted. (McCaskey v. Continental Airlines, Inc. (S.D. Tex. 2001)
133 F.Supp.2d 514.)
 
Last,
Plaintiff does not provide a response to the Separate Statement of Undisputed
Material Facts but does argue that several material facts remain in dispute,
including whether Defendants had knowledge of the broken escalator and failed
to adequately warn passengers, whether they provided sufficient crowd control
and assistance, and whether Plaintiff's fall was directly caused by Defendants'
negligence in maintaining safe premises. Plaintiff contends that these
unresolved issues are central to determining whether Defendants fulfilled their
duty of care and whether their actions or inactions contributed to her injury.
 
            While Plaintiff argues that her
injury was a result of being pushed in a crowded stairwell and that Defendant
did not adequately provide crowd control, third-party conduct and failure to
impose security measures do not create a dangerous condition. (See, Hacala, 90
Cal. App. 5th 292, 300-301; Moncur, 68 Cal. App. 3d 118, 121.)
Therefore, Defendants have met their burden of showing that Plaintiff’s claim for dangerous
condition of public property is deficient as Plaintiff has not shown that
property was in dangerous condition at the time of the incident. 
 
            Plaintiff does state that there are
triable issues of fact regarding whether Defendants had knowledge of the broken
escalator and adequately warned passengers, whether Defendants provided
sufficient crowd control and assistance to passengers, and whether Plaintff’s
fall was caused by Defendants' negligence in maintaining safe premises.
(Opposition p. 3.) However, Plaintiff provides not evidence to show that these
matters are disputed. Furthermore, even if these matters were disputed, none of
these matters show that the property was in a dangerous condition at the time
of the injury.
 
            Therefore, the Court grants the
Motion for Summary Judgement as to the third cause of action.

RULING
            
            The Court grants the
Motion for Summary Judgment.
 
BACKGROUND
 
            On April
19, 2019, Plaintiff Cynthia Shelton filed the Complaint against Defendants Los Angeles World
Airports and the City of Los Angeles, alleging causes of action for negligence,
willful failure to warn, and dangerous conditions of public property arising
from a fall at Los Angeles International Airport.
 
            On May 2, 2022, Plaintiff amended
the Complaint, adding Defendant Aerovías del Continente Americano S.A.
(erroneously named Avianca, S.A.)
 
            On November 7, 2023, Defendant filed
the instant Motion for Summary Judgment.
 
            On October 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the Opposition.
 
            On October 24, 2024, Defendant filed

            Trial is set for April 16, 2024.
 
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
            The function of a
motion for summary judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to
whether an opposing party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or
claim and to enable an order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil

summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or

381-382.)  
 
As to each cause of action, as framed by the

must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that one

the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence
in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39
Cal.4th 384, 389.)  
 
Once the defendant has met that burden, the
burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. To
establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must
produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)  
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            This
case arises from a fall that occurred on a stairwell in the Tom Bradley
International Terminal at Los Angeles International Airport. On July 30, 2018,
Plaintiff flew from San Salvador, El Salvador, to Los Angeles on Avianca
Airlines. After deplaning, she proceeded toward the baggage claim area. On her
way, she encountered a broken-down escalator and was allegedly ushered toward
an adjacent stairwell. As she descended the stairs and was approximately three
to four steps from the bottom, she fell. (UMF 1.)
 
Plaintiff subsequently filed a premises
liability lawsuit against Defendants, Los
Angeles International Airport, and the City of Los Angeles,
alleging they were responsible for her fall. Plaintiff asserts that the
Defendants negligently owned, maintained, managed, and operated the stairwell
and further alleges that they willfully or maliciously failed to guard or warn
against the dangerous condition that led to her injury.
 
On
May 2, 2022, Plaintiff filed an amendment to the Complaint
(Fictitious/Incorrect Name), substituting the fictitiously named Doe 1 with
Avianca. However, the Plaintiff did not modify or alter any of the allegations
made in the original complaint against the City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles
World Airports. As a result, the allegations against Avianca remain the same as
those initially asserted in the original complaint.
 
 
            Cause of Action 1 – Negligence
 
            “To state a cause of action for
negligence, a plaintiff must allege (1) the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty
of care, (2) the defendant breached that duty, and (3) the breach proximately
caused the plaintiff's damages or injuries.” (Lueras v. BAC Home Loans
Servicing, LP (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 49, 62.) 
 
            Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s premises
liability claim must be dismissed because Defendant was substituted for a
fictitious "Doe" defendant after the statute of limitations had
expired. The incident occurred on July 30, 2018, and the statute of limitations
for personal injury claims in California, extended by tolling due to COVID-19,
expired on January 24, 2021. (Complaint p. 4, Exhibit 2; Code
Civ. Proc., § 335.1.)
However, Plaintiff did not file the amendment to add Defendant until May 2,
2022, over 15 months after the expiration. (Doe
Amendment,
Exhibit 3.)
 
Defendant
asserts that while the "relation-back" doctrine can allow a plaintiff
to add a defendant after the statute of limitations if they were genuinely
ignorant of the defendant's identity. (Woo v. Superior Court, 75 Cal.
App. 4th 169, 176; Code Civ. Proc., § 474.) However, Plaintiff cannot prove such
ignorance. Plaintiff knew Defendant's identity at the time of the incident, as
shown by her testimony and documentation. Plaintiff testified that she knew the
airline she flew with was Defendant Avianca. (Plaintiff’s Dep. Tr., Vol. II,
93:17-20, Exhibit 5.) Plaintiff produced a boarding pass that showed she flew
with Defendant Avianca on the date of the incident. (Avianca Airlines Boarding
Pass, Exhibit 7; Plaintiff’s Dep. Tr., Vol. II, 93:21-94:2, Exhibit 5.) Defendant
also testified that on the date of the incident, she told the airport police
that Defendant Avianca’s staff were not helpful. (Plaintiff’s Dep. Tr., Vol.
II, 115:24 -119:10, Exhibit 5.) Last, in a deposition taken before Defendant
Avianca was added, Plaintiff stated that Avianca employees arrived at the scene
of the incident and provided a wheelchair. (Plaintiff’s Dep. Tr., Vol. I,
52:10-53:19, Exhibit 4.) Therefore, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot
claim to have been unaware of Defendant’s involvement in the facts giving rise
to her claim. Consequently, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s Premises
Liability claim is barred by the Statute of Limitations and must be dismissed.
 
            In opposition, Defendant provided no
argument regarding the Statute of Limitations, nor did she provide a response
to the separate statement of undisputed facts. However, Defendant does state
that there are triable issues of fact regarding whether Avianca Airlines
provided adequate assistance to passengers during disembarkation and whether
the non-operational escalator constituted a hazardous condition that Defendant
failed to address.  However, Plaintiff
does not address whether Plaintiff knew of Defendant Avianca's involvement in
the incident.
 
            Defendant has provided sufficient
evidence to show that Plaintiff knew of Defendant Avianca’s involvement in the
incident long before the filing of the Doe Amendment. (See, Plaintiff’s Dep.
Tr., Vol. II, 115:24 -119:10, Exhibit 5.) Furthermore, in the Opposition, Plaintiff
does not dispute that she knew of Defendant Avianca’s involvement before the
filing of the Doe Amendment. Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff was not
genuinely ignorant of Defendant's involvement at the time of the filing of the
Complaint or before the filing of the Doe Amendment. (see Marasco v.
Wadsworth (1978) 21 Cal. 3d 82, 88.)
 
            Therefore, the Court grants the
Motion for summary judgment as to the first cause of action.
 
            Cause of Action 2 – Willful
Failure to Warn
 
            The second cause of action asserts a count for willful
failure to warn under Civil Code § 846. 
 
            Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s willful
failure to warn claim under Civil Code § 846 is inapplicable because § 846
provides immunity, and exceptions to immunities, to property owners for
premises liability claims related to recreational use of their land. (Civ.
Code, § 846.) This statute was designed to protect property owners who allow
recreational activities on their land by limiting their liability, not to
impose liability on parties with no property interest, such as Defendant, an
airline with no ownership or control over the site of Plaintiff’s alleged
injury. (See, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. Superior Court, 10 Cal.
App. 5th 563, 568.)
 
Section
846 immunity and its exceptions only apply to owners of real property
interests used for recreational purposes, which does not include commercial
travel, like Plaintiff’s flight. (Civ. Code, § 846; UMF No. 5.) Additionally,
since Defendant had no ownership, control, or interest in the premises, the
statute cannot be used to support liability against Defendant. (UMF No. 5.)
Thus, Defendant contends that Plaintiff's willful failure to warn claim should
be dismissed as a matter of law.
 
Plaintiff
does not directly confront Defendants argument but does assert that “carriers
owe a heightened duty of care to passengers during the disembarkation process.
By abandoning Plaintiff and other passengers at the top of a non-operational
escalator, Avianca failed in its duty to ensure that Plaintiff could safely
disembark.” (Opposition p. 3.) Defendant did not provide a response to the
separate statement of undisputed facts. However, Defendant does state that
there are triable issues of fact regarding whether Avianca Airlines provided
adequate assistance to passengers during disembarkation and whether the
non-operational escalator constituted a hazardous condition that Defendant
failed to address.
 
A
threshold issue over whether one can bring a suit under Civil Code § 846 is
whether Defendant has an ownership interest in the property. (Civ. Code, § 846;
Pacific Gas & Electric Co., supra, 10 Cal. App. 5th 563, 568.)
Defendant has provided evidence showing that they are not the owner of the
subject stairwell at Los Angeles International Airport, which Plaintiff has not
disputed. (UMF No. 5.) Thus, the claim for willful failure to warn fails as a
matter of law.
 
Therefore,
the Court grants the Motion for Summary Judgement as to second cause of action.
 
 
            Cause of Action 3 – Dangerous
Condition of Public Property
 
            A public entity may be liable for a dangerous
condition of public property if the property was in a dangerous condition at
the time of the injury, the dangerous condition caused the injury, the
condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk of the type of injury that
occurred, and either a negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee
within the scope of their employment created the condition, or the public
entity had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition in
sufficient time to take measures to protect against it. (Gov. Code § 835; Sun
v. City of Oakland (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 1177, 1183.)
 
            Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s dangerous
condition of public property claim should be dismissed because Defendant is not
a public entity. Defendant is a private airline based in Colombia, not a public
entity, and it owns no public property in California. (UMF No. 4.)
Additionally, Defendant neither owns nor manages the stairwell at Los Angeles
International Airport where the incident occurred. (UMF No. 5.) Given these
undisputed facts, Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s third count should be
dismissed entirely as a matter of law.
 
            Plaintiff does not directly dispute
this argument. Instead, she argues that Defendant breached its duty of care to
passengers during the disembarkation process and that airlines are responsible
for accidents during the disembarkation process under the Montreal Convention.
(Opposition p. 3.) Defendant did not provide a response to the separate
statement of undisputed facts. However, Defendant does state that there are
triable issues of fact regarding whether Defendant provided adequate assistance
to passengers during disembarkation and whether the non-operational escalator
constituted a hazardous condition that Defendant failed to address. Defendant
does not state there is a triable issue of material fact regarding whether
Defendant is a public entity. 
 
            A claim for dangerous conditions of
public property can be brought against a public entity. (Gov. Code § 835; Sun
v. City of Oakland, supra, 166 Cal.App.4th 1177, 1183.) Defendant has
provided sufficient evidence to show that it is not a public entity. (UMF No. 4.)
Plaintiff does not dispute that Defendant is not a public entity. Thus,
Plaintiffs cause of action for dangerous conditions of public property fails as
a matter of law.
 
            Therefore, the Court grants the
Motion for Summary Judgement as to the third cause of action.
