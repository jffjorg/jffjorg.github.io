BACKGROUND
This
is a Lemon Law case.  
 
            On April
29, 2024, this Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One (the “RFPs”) from
defendant FCA US LLC (“Defendant”).  Defendant was ordered to provide a
Code-compliant, verified written response to the RFPs, without objection, and
to produce all additional responsive documents within twenty (20) business days
of the April 29, 2024 order (the “April Order”) – May 20, 2024.  On June 3, Defendant served discovery
responses containing objections without any discovery production. (Declaration
of Nadine Bedwan (the “Bedwan Decl.”), ¶ 11.) 
Plaintiff filed the within motion (the “Compliance Motion”) on June 24,
2024.  
 
Plaintiff seeks an order to compel compliance with
the April Order. Plaintiff also seeks an award of monetary sanctions in the
amount of $1,250 for the filing of this Compliance Motion.
             
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff’s Compliance Motion is unopposed
and it is GRANTED.  The objections raised in the response to the
RFPs are stricken based upon the Court’s April Order, and the Court orders that
Defendant produce to Plaintiff all documents responsive to the RFPs, even if
allegedly privileged, within twenty (20) days of the date of this Order.  
 
The
Court also finds that monetary sanctions are warranted against Defendant and
its counsel, jointly and severally, in the reasonable sum of $1,250, as
requested.  This amount is to be paid to Plaintiff
within twenty days of the date of this Order.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
