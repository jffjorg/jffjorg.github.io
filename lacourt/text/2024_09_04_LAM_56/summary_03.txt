And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling issued by the court in the case of Onetaste Incorporated vs. Netflix, Inc. The case involves a dispute over attorneys' fees and costs incurred by Netflix in connection with an anti-SLAPP motion. Onetaste argues that the court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the motion due to the pendency of an appeal, but the court finds that the filing of a notice of appeal does not deprive it of jurisdiction to award attorney fees.

The court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers and finds that the hours expended and the asserted hourly rates are reasonable. The court grants Netflix's motion for attorneys' fees and costs, awarding it $251,870.70 in fees and $3,780.51 in costs.
