RESPONDING PARTY: None
 
            The court considered the moving

BACKGROUND
             This action arose from a dispute regarding obligations
allegedly due under five Demand Promissory Notes (the “Notes”) between
Petitioners and RKA Studios, LLC and Keith St. Clair (collectively, “Respondents”).
The matter was arbitrated pursuant to the terms of the Notes.  
 
            On May 17, 2024, the arbitrator
issued an award in favor of Petitioners and against Respondents, jointly and
severally, in the following sums:
 
1.     The amount of $338,922.12
in principal ($144,942.12 + $106,000 + $87,980 on Notes 1, 4 and 5, respectively)
as well as interest pursuant to Puerto Rican law in the amount of $210,130.98
($96,784.65 + $62,680.76 + $50.665.58 on Notes 1, 4 and 5, respectively, up to
and including April 19, 2024, with such interest thereafter accruing at the
daily rate of $90.59 on Note 1, $66.25 on Note 4 and $54.98 on Note 5.
2.     With respect to
Note 2, Caruso shall recover $90,100 in principal, plus accrued interest in the
amount of $53,773.66.
3.     With respect to
Note 3, Lombardi shall recover $90,100 in principal, plus accrued interest in
the amount of $53,773.66.
4.     With respect to
Note 2 and Note 3, interest shall continue to accrue on the preceding amounts at
the daily rate of $56.31.
5.     Additionally, Petitioners
shall recover attorney’s fees of $65,605, costs of $2,447.45, and arbitration
fee reimbursement of $11,945.46.
 
Petitioners
now move to confirm the arbitration award by filing the instant petition to
confirm the arbitration award against Respondent on May 30, 2024, with a Notice
of Hearing dated May 30, 2024 and a Notice or Rescheduled Hearing re Petition filed
June 26, 2024.
            


 
DISCUSSION
            An arbitration award is not
directly enforceable until it is confirmed by a court and judgment is
entered.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1287.6; Jones
v. Kvistad (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 836, 840.) 
 A party may seek a court judgment
confirming an arbitration award by filing and serving a petition at least 10
days, but no more than four years after the award is served.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.)
 
“Any
party to an arbitration in which an award has been made may petition the court
to confirm, correct or vacate the award.  The petition shall name as respondents all
parties to the arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound
by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.)  “A petition under this chapter shall: (a) Set
forth the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate
unless the petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement. (b) Set forth
the names of the arbitrators. (c) Set forth or have attached a copy of the
award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.)  “If a petition or response under this chapter
is duly served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as made…unless in
accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as
corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.)  Any response to the petition is required to be
filed and served within 10 days after service of the petition.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.6.) 
 
The
Court finds that Petitioners have established that the procedural requirements
have been met.  There being no response,
the Court finds that the arbitration award is proper to confirm. “If [an] award
is confirmed, judgment must be entered in conformity therewith.” (Jones,
supra.) 
 
RULING
Based
on the foregoing, the Court grants Petitioners’ petition to confirm arbitration
award.  The Court orders Petitioners to
file and serve a proposed judgment within 10 days of the date of this order. 
 
Petitioners
are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
