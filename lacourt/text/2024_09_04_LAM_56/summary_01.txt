And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the petition to confirm the arbitration award filed by Blue Rider Entertainment, Inc. et al. (Petitioners) against RKA Studios, LLC et al. (Respondents). The petition seeks to confirm an arbitration award issued on May 17, 2024, in favor of Petitioners and against Respondents in the amount of $338,922.12 (principal) and $210,130.98 (interest). The award also includes attorney's fees, costs, and arbitration fee reimbursement.

The court finds that Petitioners have established that the procedural requirements for confirming an arbitration award have been met. Since no response was filed by Respondents, the court grants the petition and confirms the arbitration award. The court orders Petitioners to file and serve a proposed judgment within 10 days of the date of this order.
