RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
ONETASTE INCORPORATED (“OneTaste”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
             On November 3, 2023, OneTaste filed a
complaint (“Complaint”) against Netflix and DOES 1 to 100, inclusive, alleging
a single cause of action for Defamation Per Se.  On March 4, 2024, Netflix filed a special
motion to strike the Complaint (the “Anti-SLAPP Motion”).  On April 29, 2024, the Court granted
Netflix’s Anti-SLAPP Motion.  (4/29/2024
Order.)  On May 29, 2024, OneTaste filed
its Notice of Appeal. 
 
            Netflix now moves for an order
awarding attorneys’ fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16(c) by
filing the instant Motion to Recover Fees and Costs (the “Motion”) filed on
June 25, 2024.  OneTaste filed its
opposition on August 19, 2024, and Netflix filed a reply on August 27, 2024.
 
DISCUSSION
Legal Standard 
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16(c)(1), “a prevailing defendant on a
special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney’s
fees and costs.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1141-1142.)  Parties may seek attorney’s fees and costs
in connection with a special motion to strike: (1) in the moving papers, (2) in
a subsequently filed motion, or (3) as part of a cost memorandum.  (Melbostad
v. Fisher (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 987, 992.) 
 
A
prevailing party may only recover for work related to the motion, not the
entire suit. (Lafayette Morehouse, Inc. v. Chronicle Publishing Co.
(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1383 (“These reports clearly show the Legislature
intended that a prevailing defendant on a motion to strike be allowed to
recover attorney fees and costs only on the motion to strike, not the entire
suit.  We conclude the trial court erred
when it awarded the Chronicle fees for the entire suit.”); S.B. Beach Properties v. Berti (2006) 39 Cal.4th 374, 381.)  However, compensable fees include fees
incurred establishing the appropriate fee amount.  (569
East County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6
Cal.App.5th 426, 433 (“An award of attorney fees to a prevailing defendant on
an anti-SLAPP motion properly includes attorney fees incurred to litigate the
special motion to strike (the merits fees) plus the fees incurred in connection
with litigating the fee award itself (the fees on fees).”); Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at 1133 (“an attorney fee award should
ordinarily include compensation for all the hours reasonably spent, including
those relating solely to the fee.”).) 
 
“The
California Supreme Court has upheld the lodestar method for determining the
appropriate amount of attorney fees for a prevailing defendant on an anti-SLAPP
motion. [Citation.]  Under this method, a
court assesses attorney fees by first determining the time spent and the
reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney.  The court next determines whether that
lodestar figure should be adjusted based on various relevant factors.”  (Mann v. Quality Old Time Service, Inc.
(2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 328, 342; Frym v.
601 Main Street LLC (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 613, 620 [“It is well settled
that the trial courts are to use the lodestar method when determining an award
of attorney fees under the anti-SLAPP statute.”].) 
 
“A trial court assessing attorney fees
begins with a touchstone or lodestar figure, based on the ‘careful compilation
of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney . . .
involved in the presentation of the case.”  (Christian
Research Institute v. Alnor (2008)
165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.)  The
Court “need not simply award the sum requested. To the contrary, ascertaining
the fee amount is left to the trial court’s sound discretion.”  (Ibid.)
 “The reasonableness of attorney fees is
within the discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration
of such factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues,
the experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved.  The court may also consider whether the amount
requested is based upon unnecessary or duplicative work.” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)  “The basis for the trial court’s calculation
must be the actual hours counsel has devoted to the case, less those that result
from inefficient or duplicative use of time.”  (Horsford
v. Board Of Trustees Of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 395.)  “The law is clear, however,
that an award of attorney fees may be based on counsel’s declarations, without
production of detailed time records.”  (Raining Data Corp. v. Barrenechea (2009)
175 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1375.)  “[T]he
verified time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are entitled
to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.”  (Horsford, supra, 132 Cal.App.4th at 396; City of Colton v. Singletary (2012)
206 Cal.App.4th 751, 785 [same].)
 
Netflix’s Motion
The Motion is
supported by the declaration of attorney Samantha Lachman attaching the billing
records showing the time and work performed for which fees are sought.  (Lachman Decl.; Exh. B.)  Attorney Karlene W. Goller also attests to
the reasonableness of the amount of time spent by Netflix’s defense counsel and
the total fees incurred.  (Goller Decl.,
¶ 9.)
 
Netflix requests the amount of $236,361.20, representing fees incurred in
connection with the Anti-SLAPP Motion, broken down as follows:
(Lachman Decl., ¶
14; Exh. B.)
            
            Attorney Lachman also seeks an
additional $15,509.50 in attorneys’ fees in connection with the Opposition to
the present Motion, Netflix’s Reply, and the hearing.  (Lachman Supplemental Decl., ¶¶ 2-4.)  Thus, the requested attorney’s fees
amount to a total of $251,870.70. 
In addition, Netflix seeks reimbursement in the amount of $3,780.51
for costs incurred through May 30, 2024.  (Lachman Decl., ¶ 23, Exh. B.)
 
OneTaste’s
Opposition
OneTaste,
in its opposition, did not present any evidence that the fees requested were
unreasonable.  Instead, it contends that
the Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the present Motion, arguing that the
proceedings in this Court are automatically stayed under Civil Procedure Code section
916 while OneTaste’s appeal of the order granting Netflix’s anti- SLAPP motion
is pending.
 
Court’s Analysis
OneTaste’s position is unsupported by
prevailing case law on the matter.  “[T]he
filing of a notice of appeal does not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction
to award attorney fees as costs post trial.”  (Bankes
v. Lucas (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 365, 368.)  “Although a prevailing party at trial may not
be the prevailing party after an appeal, it has been held that a motion for
attorney fees is not premature despite the filing of a notice of appeal.”  (Id.)
 “[A]n award of attorney fees as costs is
a collateral matter which is embraced in the action but is not affected by the
order from which an appeal is taken.”  (Id. at 369.) 
 
As the Court of Appeal has held:
 
“[Plaintiff] argued in the trial court that the trial
court lacked jurisdiction to rule on defendants' motion for attorney fees due
to the pendency of [Plaintiff’'s] appeal from the order granting defendants'
motion to strike. He relied upon section 916, subdivision (a), which states
that with certain exceptions, the perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in
the trial court upon the judgment or order appealed from.  
 
The trial court properly concluded it
had jurisdiction to proceed because the trial court “retains jurisdiction to
entertain a motion for attorney fees despite an appeal[.]” (Nazemi v. Tseng
(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 1633, 1639, 7 Cal.Rptr.2d 762.)
(Robertson
v. Rodriguez (1995) 36 Cal. App. 4th 347, 360.)  (See also, Doe v. Luster (2006) 145
Cal. App. 4th 139, 144 [“Even if the order granting the motion has been
appealed, the trial court retains jurisdiction to entertain a motion for
attorney fees.”].)
 
Thus,
this Court has jurisdiction to rule on the Motion and, as stated above,
OneTaste presents no evidence that the requested fees were not reasonable.  The Court therefore finds that the hours expended
and the asserted hourly rates are reasonable. 

 
RULING
Accordingly,
the Motion is GRANTED.  Netflix is awarded its attorney’s fees
in the amount of $251,870.70, plus $3,780.51
in costs against OneTaste.  
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 


 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
