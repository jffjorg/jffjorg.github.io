And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on a motion to compel depositions and impose sanctions filed by Gonzalez. The motion was filed in response to Plaintiffs' failure to appear for scheduled depositions. The judge has granted the motion and ordered Plaintiffs to appear for deposition within 20 days of the hearing. The judge has also denied Gonzalez's request for sanctions, finding that an award of sanctions against Plaintiffs would be unjust. The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.450, 2025.210, and 2025.410, which provide for the compulsory examination of parties and the imposition of sanctions for failure to comply with deposition notices. The judge has emphasized that Plaintiffs' failure to appear for depositions was unjustified and that Gonzalez had properly noticed the depositions and filed a valid motion to compel.
