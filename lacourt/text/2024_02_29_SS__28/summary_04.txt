And here is a summary in English text:

The court has considered the moving, opposing, and reply papers and rules as follows. The plaintiff, Megan R. Tucker, filed a lawsuit against the defendant, Azusa Pacific University, alleging general negligence and premises liability. The defendant filed an answer and a motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication. The plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion, and the defendant filed a reply.

The court has reviewed the informed consent forms and other evidence and concludes that the defendant has not carried its initial summary judgment burden of showing it owed the plaintiff no duty based on her signature of the consent forms or the primary assumption of risk doctrine. The court finds that the defendant has not presented evidence establishing as a matter of law that the informed consent forms covered the plaintiff's work maintaining the softball field or that driving a utility vehicle to maintain the softball field was inherent to playing softball.

The court denies the motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication. The moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling and to file the proof of service of this ruling with the court within five days.
