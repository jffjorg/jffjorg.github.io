Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling sets aside the default entered against Cross-Defendant Eric Raymond Fascia on August 14, 2023. Fascia had failed to file a timely response to the cross-complaint and was subsequently defaulted. However, Fascia has since filed a motion to vacate the default, citing that he did not understand the need to respond to the cross-complaint and has now obtained counsel and is prepared to file an answer. The Judge grants the motion, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), which allows the Court to relieve a party from a judgment or order taken against them through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The Judge orders Fascia to file an answer or other responsive pleading within five days of the hearing.
