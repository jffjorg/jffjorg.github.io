And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Tali Sigalus' motion to quash service of summons on the ground that Plaintiff Haleh Shekarchian failed to serve her in a code-complaint manner. The proof of service shows that Defendant was served by personal service at her residence on April 1, 2024, but Defendant claims she was not personally served and provides a sworn statement to support her claim. The judge finds that Plaintiff has a presumption of proper service with a declaration from a registered California process server, and Defendant has not sufficiently rebutted that presumption. As a result, the judge has denied Defendant's motion to quash service of summons and ordered her to file a responsive pleading within 15 days of the entry of this order.
