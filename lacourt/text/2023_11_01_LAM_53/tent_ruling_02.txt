The court notes that there are inconsistencies between Plaintiff’s moving
papers, which state that further responses should be compelled as to numbers 8,
11, 17, 30, and 31, and the separate statement, which lists numbers 1, 2, 30,
and 31 to be the discovery requests at issue in the motion.  (Mot., pp. 4:18, 7:8.)  The court has considered the arguments
presented by the parties only as to numbers 11, 30, and 31.

The court disregards the references made to Requests for Production numbers 8
and 17 pursuant to Plaintiff’s assertion, in reply, that such references were
clerical errors.  (Reply, p. 3:5-7.)
