Order to Show Cause re: Why the Court
Should Not, on Its Own Motion, Grant a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
The court considered the Petition. 
No response to the Order to Show Cause was filed.  
DISCUSSION
Petitioners Gabriela Aguinaldo, Selma Aguinaldo, and Ferdinand
Aguinaldo (“Petitioners”) filed the Petition for Ordinary Mandamus and
Declaratory Relief, Injunctive Relief, and Temporary and Permanent Restraining
Order (the “Petition”) in this action on February 24, 2023, against respondent
Fly High Altadena, LLC (“Respondent”). 
On June 26, 2023, the court set for hearing an Order to Show Cause re:
why the court should not, on its motion, grant a motion for judgment on the
pleadings because Petitioners do not state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action against Respondent. 
Petitioners did not file a response to the Order to Show Cause. 
The court grants its own motion for judgment on the pleadings as to
the first cause of action for writ of ordinary mandate because it does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action since (1) “[a] court may
issue a writ of mandate only if the petitioner establishes: ([A]) a clear,
present . . . ministerial duty on the part of the respondent; ([B]) a
correlative clear, present and beneficial right in the petitioner to the
performance of that duty [citations]; and ([C]) no plain, speedy, and adequate
alternative remedy exists [citation][,]” but (2) Petitioners have not alleged
the existence of a clear, present, ministerial duty on the part of Respondent
and a correlating right in Petitioners to the performance of that duty, and
instead have alleged that Respondent acted negligently.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd.
(c)(3)(B)(ii); Rutgard v. City of Los Angeles (2020) 52 Cal.App.5th 815,
824 [internal quotations omitted]; Pet., ¶¶ 44-49 [Respondent was negligent (i)
in failing to remove, cover, or cut flush to the concrete the subject bolts,
(ii) in failing to close off the section with the exposed bolts, and (iii) in
failing to provide first aid assistance to injured patron].) 
The court grants its own motion for judgment on the pleadings as to
the second cause of action for declaratory relief because it does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action since Petitioners have not
alleged the existence of an active, “‘actual controversy involving justiciable
questions relating to the rights or obligations of a party.’”  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 438, subd.
(c)(3)(B)(ii), 1060; Lee v. Silveira (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 527,
546.)  Instead, Petitioners have
requested the court issue general declarations that Respondent was negligent and
operates an adventure park business without regard to the safety of its
customers, which does not allege a controversy “relating to the legal rights
and duties of the respective parties,” i.e., Petitioners and Respondent.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1060.)  
ORDER
            The court grants its own motion for
judgment on the pleadings as to petitioners Gabriela Aguinaldo, Selma
Aguinaldo, and Ferdinand Aguinaldo’s Petition for Ordinary Mandamus and
Declaratory Relief, Injunctive Relief, Temporary and Permanent Restraining Order
without leave to amend. 
 
 
The court orders that this action filed by petitioners Gabriela
Aguinaldo, Selma Aguinaldo, and Ferdinand Aguinaldo is dismissed.
The court directs the clerk to give notice of this order.  
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  November 1, 2023
