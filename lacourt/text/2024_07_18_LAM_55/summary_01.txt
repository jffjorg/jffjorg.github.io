Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to compel the attendance of Dr. Ryan Greene at a deposition and the production of documents. The defendants failed to properly serve the deponent with the motion, as required by California Rules of Court, rule 3.1346, which requires personal service on the non-party deponent. The judge also noted that the defendants' reliance on Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480, which permits service by mail, is misplaced, as the section only applies to service of a motion to compel subsequent to the completion of a deposition record. The judge further observed that the Court is not empowered to review the underlying merits of arbitrators' decisions on discovery matters and that the parties should reconcile their positions on issues such as the applicability of Aixtron, Inc. v. Veeco Instruments, Inc. and McConnell v. Advantest America, Inc. with the facts of this dispute if they return to court after proper notice to the deponent.
