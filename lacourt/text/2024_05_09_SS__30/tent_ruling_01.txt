Plaintiff is ordered to appear for deposition within 20 days of this order.Defendant’s request for sanctions is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $875 to Defendant’s counsel within 20 days of this order.Moving party is ordered to give notice.Legal StandardAny party may obtain discovery … by taking the oral deposition of any person, including any party to the action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.)CCP section 2025.450(a) provides: “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action . . . , without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document . . . described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document . . . described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450(a).)Where a party objects to the deposition, the proper remedy is an objection under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.410. If such an objection is made within three calendar days before the deposition date, the objecting party must make personal service of that objection. (Code Civ. Proc. 2025.410, subd. (b).)CCP section 2025.450(b) provides: “A motion under subdivision (a)… shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.”¿ (Id., § 2025.450(b).)DiscussionAEG has been attempting to complete Plaintiff's deposition since November 2023. (Lopez Decl.¶ 17; Exh. I.) AEG served multiple notices of taking Plaintiff’s deposition, and Plaintiff canceled the deposition each time. AEG served another Notice of Deposition, with a Request to Produce Documents, setting Plaintiff's Deposition for February 22, 2024. (Lopez Decl.¶ 18; Exh. J.) AEG received no written objections to the Notice of Deposition. (Lopez Decl.¶ 18.) On February 20, 2024, AEG's counsel sent an email to confirm the February 22nd deposition. (Lopez Decl.¶ 19; Exh. K.) Plaintiff's counsel stated Plaintiff would not be appearing. (Lopez Decl.¶ 19; Exh. K.) AEG attempted to confer with Plaintiff's counsel and advised AEG would not take the February 22nd deposition off calendar. (Lopez Decl.¶ 19; Exh. K.)On February 22, 2024, Plaintiff failed to appear for her deposition and did not produce the documents requested. (Lopez Decl.¶ 21; Exh. M.) AEG's counsel called and emailed Plaintiff's counsel to inquire about Plaintiff's non-appearance at the deposition. Plaintiff's counsel responded that Plaintiff would not appear and again referred to alternative dates for taking the deposition. (Lopez Decl.¶ 21; Exh. N.)On February 29, 2024, AEG's counsel contacted Plaintiff's counsel in an attempt to obtain new dates and an extension of time in which to file its dispositive motion in an effort to avoid the instant motion. (Lopez Decl.¶ 23; Exh. O.) However, to date, Plaintiff has not responded to the request for new dates and extension of time. (Lopez Decl.¶ 23.)As Plaintiff was served with a notice to appear for deposition, and failed to appear, the motion is granted. Plaintiff is ordered to appear for deposition within 20 days of this order.SanctionsIf a motion under CCP section 2025.450(a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (CCP §2025.450(g)(1).)Defendants’ request for sanctions is granted as no opposition has been filed to show substantial justification. However, the amount requested is not reasonable and will be reduced. Thus, the Court imposes sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $875 ($815 Court Reporter Fee, and $60 filing fee) to be paid within 20 days of this order. The Court notes the statute says nothing about imposing sanctions against the attorney, and thus, cannot impose sanctions against Plaintiff’s counsel.Defendant’s request for sanctions under CCP section 2023.030 for the misuse of discovery is denied, as "sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 do not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.” (City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504.)
