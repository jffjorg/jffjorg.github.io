And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted Defendant Combined Properties, Inc.'s motion for an undertaking, but in a reduced amount. The court has ordered Plaintiff to post bond in the amount of $11,890 within thirty days or risk dismissal of her action. Defendant Common Area Maintenance's motion for an undertaking is denied. The court found that Defendant CPI has met its burden of showing a reasonable possibility of prevailing due to the contract with RCA to provide landscape maintenance, including maintenance of the planter that allegedly spilled sand onto the walkway. The court reduced the amount of the undertaking by $42,000 due to the lack of detail provided by Defendant regarding the expert witness fees.
