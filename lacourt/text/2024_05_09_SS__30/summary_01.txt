And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff and orders the plaintiff to appear for deposition within 20 days. The defendant's request for sanctions is also granted, and the plaintiff is ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $875 to the defendant's counsel within 20 days. The plaintiff's counsel failed to respond to the defendant's attempts to confer and did not appear for the deposition, which is a violation of the California Code of Civil Procedure. The court finds that the plaintiff acted without substantial justification and imposes sanctions accordingly.
