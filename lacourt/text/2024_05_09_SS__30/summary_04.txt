Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to consolidate two cases without prejudice. The defendant's motion did not comply with local rules, and the defendant did not file a notice of the motion in the second case. The judge noted that the two cases involve common issues of law and fact, but the defendant's motion did not provide sufficient evidence to support consolidation. The judge also noted that the two cases are assigned to different departments, which is contrary to local rules. The judge has given the defendant notice to correct the deficiencies in the motion, and the motion will be re-heard once the deficiencies are addressed.
