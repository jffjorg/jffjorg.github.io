Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a challenge to a settlement between some parties in a case involving a home purchase. The plaintiff claims that the defendants failed to disclose the development of neighboring property, which changed the character of the neighborhood. The defendants have settled with some parties, but not all. The issue is whether the settling defendants owe an independent duty to the DE Defendants, who have brought a cross complaint against them. The judge concludes that there is no such duty and that the damages sought by the DE Defendants are the same as those for equitable indemnity or contribution. The judge finds that the settlement is in good faith and that all claims for equitable indemnity or contribution, including those in the DE Defendants' cross complaint, will be barred. The judge denies the challenge to the good faith settlement.
