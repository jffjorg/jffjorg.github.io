And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion to reopen discovery and a motion for sanctions against O'Gara. The dispute centers around O'Gara's purported failure to provide full and complete responses to discovery requests. The judge notes that both parties have contributed to the delay in bringing the motion and that the procedure has been complex. The judge grants the motion to reopen discovery and will hear the motion for sanctions. The judge recommends that the parties discuss the issues further and provide adequate responses to discovery requests. The judge also notes that O'Gara's conduct has been problematic and that the court will not tolerate attempts to run out the clock. Ultimately, the judge's goal is to bring the case to a close and resolve the disputes.
