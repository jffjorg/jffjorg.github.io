 Case Number:  23SMCV01079    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2024    Dept:  I The court must DENY the motion.  The court will be dark starting tomorrow and
will not be back in regular session until November 18, 2024.  The court regrets it, but unless the
breakdown is ethical in nature—such as a threatened suit by the client against
counsel—counsel will have to wait for the scheduled hearing.  At the hearing, counsel can likely represent
defendant for the motion to compel; if counsel lacks certain information,
counsel can, of course, so state. 
Counsel should ensure that the client is aware that there is a motion
coming up and that, in light of the motion to withdraw, counsel will do the
best it can, but the client might want another attorney to be retained more
quickly.  DMH cannot, of course,
represent itself.  The court is concerned
that granting the order today deprives the client of an opportunity to oppose
the request, which is a denial of due process.
