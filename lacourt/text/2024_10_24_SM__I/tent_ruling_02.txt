 Case Number:  22SMCV02372    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2024    Dept:  I The application is GRANTED in that the court will hear the
motion as scheduled and exercises its discretion to hear it less than 30 days
before trial.  The motion was timely
filed, but due to the fact that the court will be dark for three weeks, the
court is running a bit longer than usual on MSJ’s.  Allowing the motion to be heard less than 30
days before trial will allow the court to work the matter up fully and also
allow the motion to be heard.
