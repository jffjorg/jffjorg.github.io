And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for sanctions against the defendant's counsel for improper conduct. The issue arises from a subpoena served on Trombly, a witness, and a letter written by defense counsel suggesting that Trombly ignore the subpoena. However, the court's review of the docket shows that no motion to quash the subpoena was filed. The judge finds that defense counsel's conduct appears sanctionable, as they interfered with court process without good cause. The judge will hear from the defendant to understand why the letter was written, and will consider whether sanctions are warranted. The judge notes that if defense counsel was honestly mistaken about filing a motion to quash, the court can understand human error. However, if defense counsel wrote the letter knowing there was no motion to quash, or did nothing to withdraw the letter upon discovery of the mistake, the court has serious concerns about the propriety of such conduct. The judge will consider a motion for sanctions or an OSC re: sanctions, and notes that the maximum amount for sanctions would be $10,000.
