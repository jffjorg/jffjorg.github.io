And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees and costs. The plaintiff, XCVI, LLC, is awarded $369,760.50 in attorney's fees and $20,325.01 in costs. The fees and costs are awarded because the plaintiff was the prevailing party in the jury trial and is entitled to recover them under the contract. The judge finds that the fees and costs were reasonably incurred and that the plaintiff's counsel provided high-quality services. The defendant, LACAUSA, LLC and Greg Lorber, did not oppose the motion, so the judge did not have to consider any opposition. The judge also notes that the defendant failed to timely object to the costs, which constitutes a waiver of their right to object.
