  Case Number:  20STCV04647    Hearing Date:   February 29, 2024    Dept:  49 XCVI, LLC v. LACAUSA, et al.PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES AND COSTS MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff XCVI, LLCRESPONDING PARTY(S): NoneSTATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: Plaintiff XCVI, LLC filed this action against Defendants LACAUSA, LLC and Greg Lorber, alleging causes of action for (1) breach of contract – asset purchase agreement, (2) breach of contract – guaranty, (3) accounting, and (4) unfair business practices Under Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq. Plaintiff alleged that LACAUSA and XCVI entered into an asset purchase agreement (“APA”) on August 8, 2019. In connection with the APA, Defendant Lorber and XCVI entered into a guaranty (“Guaranty”) whereby Lorber guaranteed LACAUSA’s obligations under the APA, on August 8, 2019. Pursuant to the APA, LACAUSA was to pay XCVI a total of $727,982.97 as follows: (1) $250,000 for Trademarks, Domain Names, and Social Media Accounts at time of closing; (2) $88,148.05 for Samples and Related Assets; and (3) $389,834.92 for Inventory. Plaintiff alleged that Defendants had defaulted under the APA.  This suit followed. The matter proceeded to a jury trial starting December 11, 2023. On December 14, 2023, the jury returned a unanimous verdict in Plaintiff’s favor, awarding Plaintiff $376,144.37 for Defendants’ contractual breach.Plaintiff now moves to recover its reasonable attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to contract as the prevailing party at trial. No opposition was filed. TENTATIVE RULING:Plaintiff’s unopposed Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED in the requested amount of $369,760.50.Plaintiffs are also awarded their full costs in the amount of $20,325.01. Plaintiff is to give notice. DISCUSSION:Motion for Attorney’s Fees and CostsA. BackgroundPlaintiff moves for an award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as the prevailing party at trial.  Plaintiff seeks attorney’s fees in the amount $369,760.50 and costs in the amount of $20,325.01.In California, “[a] party may not recover attorney fees unless expressly authorized by statute or contract.” (Hom v. Petrou (2021) 67 Cal. App. 5th 459, 464; See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1021, 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).) Civil Code section 1717(a) provides:In any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to other costs.“California courts liberally construe the term ‘on a contract’ in Civil Code section 1717.” (Blickman Turkus, LP v. MF Downtown Sunnyvale, LLC (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 858, 894.) “‘As long as the action “involve[s]” a contract, it is “ ‘on [the] contract’ ” within the meaning of section 1717.’ ” (Id.) “To determine whether an action is on the contract, we look to the complaint and focus on the basis of the cause of action. [Citations.] Any action that is based on a contract is an action on that contract regardless of the relief sought.” (Yoon v. Cam IX Tr. (2021) 60 Cal. App. 5th 388, 392.)First, there is no question that the action was “on a contract.” The basis of the action was Defendants’ breach of the asset purchase agreement (the “APA”) entered into between Plaintiff and Defendant LACAUSA on August 8, 2019. (Compl. ¶¶ 1, 19.) Defendant Lorber guaranteed LACAUSA’s obligations under the APA. (Id. ¶¶ 2, 27.) Second, there is also no question that Plaintiff is the prevailing party here, having received a verdict in its favor at trial. (See 12/27/2023 Judgment.)Finally, the Guaranty accompanying the APA “specifically provides” for recovery of attorney’s fees. (See Civ. Code, § 1642.; R.W.L. Enterprises v. Oldcastle, Inc. (2017) 17 Cal. App. 5th 1019, 1027 [“[s]everal contracts relating to the same matters, between the same parties, and made as parts of substantially one transaction, are to be taken together.”].) Section 7 of the Guaranty, titled “Costs, Expenses and Attorney’s Fees” provides:Guarantor shall pay to Guarantied Party immediately upon demand the full amount of all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket payments, advances, charges, costs and expenses, including reasonable and documented out-of pocket reasonable attorneys’ fees, expended or incurred by Guarantied Party in connection with the enforcement of any of Guarantied Party’s rights, powers or remedies and/or the collection of any amounts which become due to Guarantied Party under this Guaranty, and the prosecution or defense of any action in any way related to this Guaranty, whether incurred at the trial or appellate level, in any other proceeding or otherwise, and including any of the foregoing incurred in connection with any bankruptcy proceeding (including without limitation, any adversary proceeding, contested matter or motion brought by Guarantied Party or any other person) relating to the Company, Guarantor or any other person or entity.(Brutzkus Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. B, ¶ 7.)Accordingly, Defendant Lorber, as guarantor, is liable for all “reasonable and documented out-of pocket reasonable attorneys’ fees” incurred by Plaintiff in connection with the prosecution of this action. (Id.) The court now continues to address the reasonableness of the fees sought.B. Reasonableness of Fees1. Reasonable Hourly RateThe determination of reasonable amount of attorney fees is within the sound discretion of trial courts.  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095; Akins v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000) 79 Cal. App. 4th 1127, 1134.)  “The determination of what constitutes a reasonable fee generally ‘begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate….’”  “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”  (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)  In setting the hourly rate for an attorney fees award, courts are entitled to consider the rate of “‘fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community for similar work.’”  (Bihun v. AT&T Information Systems, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal. App. 4th 976, 997 overruled on other grounds by Lakin v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 644, 664.)  The burden is on the party seeking attorney fees to prove reasonableness of the fees.  (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal. App. 4th 603, 615.) The Court has broad discretion in determining the amount of a reasonable attorney's fee award which will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal. App. 4th 1379, 1393-94.  The Court need not explain its calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded in detail; identifying the factors considered in arriving at the amount will suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Industries Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-75.) Between 2020 and 2024, Plaintiff staffed nine (9) attorneys on the case, billing at rates between $300.00 per hour and $775.00 per hour. (Brutzkus Decl. ¶¶ 23-31.)Under the totality of the circumstances and based upon general prevailing rates in the Los Angeles area for this type of litigation, this court finds the quoted rates to be reasonable. This determination considers the complexity of the case, the quality of services provided, and the attorneys’ experiences.  2. Reasonable Time SpentPlaintiff’s counsel seeks compensation for a total of 593.7 hours billed. (Brutzkus Decl. ¶ 40.) A fee award “should ordinarily include compensation for all the hours reasonably spent, including those relating solely to the fee.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal. 4th 1122, 1133 [emphasis in the original].)It is also noted that “it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific items challenged [within the moving party’s verified billing invoice], with a sufficient argument and citations to evidence.  General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.”  (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488.) By failing to oppose, Defendants have not met their burden to establish that any portion of the fees are unreasonable.Based on this court’s independent review—and without an opposition—the court concludes the time quoted is reasonable under the circumstances. (See Brutzkus Decl. ¶¶ 37-40.) This matter began with a default and default judgment against Defendants, after which Plaintiff obtained a writ of attachment. Those were ultimately set aside, which triggered substantial discovery. Plaintiff eventually moved for summary adjudication before trial, which was denied. The matter then proceeded to a four-day jury trial, culminating with a favorable verdict for Plaintiff. Considering the life of the case and issues presented, the amount of law and motion practice, the breadth of necessary discovery, and that the parties tried the case to verdict, the time quoted is not excessive. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s unopposed Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED in the requested amount of $369,760.50.Motion for CostsPlaintiff filed its Memorandum of Costs on January 18, 2024, seeking $20,325.01 in costs. In general, the prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding.  (Code Civ. Proc., §1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott Co. Of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.) With regard to the definition of “prevailing party”, section 1032(a)(4) provides that:  “‘Prevailing party” includes the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant. If any party recovers other than monetary relief and in situations other than as specified, the “prevailing party” shall be as determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the court, in its discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed, may apportion costs between the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under Section 1034.”  Allowable costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 must be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation, and must be reasonable in amount.  An item not specifically allowable under section 1033.5(a) nor prohibited under subdivision (b) may nevertheless be recoverable in the discretion of the court if they meet the above requirements (i.e., reasonably necessary and reasonable in amount). (Ladas v. California State Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-774.)   In determining litigation success, Courts should “respect substance rather than form” and consider “the unique facts and circumstances of each case.” (Marina Pacifica Homeowners Assn. v. S. California Fin. Corp. (2018) 20 Cal. App. 5th 191, 206.) When the items on the verified cost bill appear to be proper, the burden of proof is on the contesting party. (Fennessy v. Deleuw-Cather Corp. (1990) 218 Cal. App. 3d 1192.) Defendants have not filed a motion to tax costs. It is the challenging party that has the burden of demonstrating that those costs are unreasonable or unnecessary. (Adams v. Ford Motor Co., 199 Cal. App. 4th 1475, 1486 (2011); 612 South LLC v. Laconic Limited Partnership, 184 Cal. App. 4th 1270, 1285 (2010).)  Moreover, the time for Defendants to do so has passed. “Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum.” (CRC Rule 3.1700(b)(1).) Where, as here, the cost memorandum is served electronically, the period to tax is extended by two court days. (See CRC Rule 3.1700(b)(1); CCP § 1010.6(a)(3)(B). Plaintiffs served their cost memorandum on January 18, 2024, by electronic service. Fifteen days after service of the cost memorandum falls on or about February 2, 2024. Then, extending the period two court days for electronic service placed the due date for Defendant’s motion as February 6, 2024.Based on Defendants’ failure to timely object, Plaintiffs are awarded their full costs in the amount of $20,325.01. (See Douglas v. Willis (1994) 27 Cal. App. 4th 287, 289 [“failure to file a motion to tax costs constitutes a waiver of the right to object.”].)Moving party to give notice.IT IS SO ORDERED.Dated:   February 29, 2024 ___________________________________ Randolph M.
