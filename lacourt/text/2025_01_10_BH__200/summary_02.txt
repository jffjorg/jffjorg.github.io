And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a dispute between WW and GSC regarding a contractual agreement. GSC argues that they can sue for breach of contract and fraudulent inducement, but the judge finds that this argument is not material to the motion. The judge notes that GSC's second cause of action for fraud does not specifically allege fraudulent inducement, and that the alleged fraudulent conduct occurred during the contractual relationship, not before the parties entered into the agreement. The judge also finds that the Economic Loss Rule applies, which means that GSC cannot sue for both breach of contract and damages. The judge concludes that GSC's elections to stand on the agreement and seek damages is not actionable, and that the alleged fraudulent conduct is only relevant in the context of a claim for fraud.
