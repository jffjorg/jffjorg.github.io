And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The motion for attorneys' fees and expenses filed by the plaintiffs, Micaela Leyva and Rafael Duran, is continued to December 8, 2023, to allow the defendants, Karen Baca, Ana Moreno, and Co-op Management, to respond to the new issues raised by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs are seeking an award of attorneys' fees and expenses in the amount of $201,762.01 and $1,712.01, respectively, based on their success in the trial.

The court finds that the plaintiffs have made a sufficient showing that the billing rates for each of their attorneys are reasonable, and is prepared to award $450 per hour for attorney Rodriguez and $650 per hour for attorney Kwasigroch. The court also finds that the fees incurred by the plaintiffs in connection with the prosecution of the second cause of action for Demand for Rent for Uninhabitable Dwelling under Civil Code section 1942.4 are reasonable and should be awarded.

The defendants argue that the plaintiffs' claim for attorneys' fees is excessive and that the billing records are incomplete and inaccurate. The defendants also argue that the plaintiffs have failed to provide a detailed breakdown of the fees incurred and have refused to serve the relevant documents directly.

The court requires a detailed opposition to the claimed hourly rate, the matters charged, and the defendants' proposal of an alternative number for any attorneys' fees award. The court also orders the plaintiffs to serve all moving documents, including the original moving papers, supplemental declarations, and supporting papers, by direct email and follow-up mailing.

The court notes that the defendants have not responded to the argument that fees are awardable under the attorney's fees provision of the Rental Contract, and orders the defendants to address this issue in their opposition. The court also notes that the defendants have not provided a detailed breakdown of the fees incurred and have refused to serve the relevant documents directly, and orders the defendants to provide this information in their opposition.
