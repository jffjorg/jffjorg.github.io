Arthur Young & Co. (1990, 2nd Dist.) 223 Cal.App.3d 1429, 1436.  In this case, plaintiff has failed to respond to authorized methods of discovery and propounding party has submitted evidence that it has incurred expenses as a result of the conduct. Since the motions are unopposed, there is no evidence that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust.  Defendant requests $860 for each of the three motions, which request is reasonable.  There is no opposition so no challenge to the billing rates charged, or the hours spent.  The sanctions are awarded in full as requested. RULING:[No opposition]Defendant USC Verdugo Hills Hospital’s UNOPPOSED Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Set One is GRANTED.  Plaintiff Michael Lloyd is ordered to serve verified responses to Form Interrogatories— General, Set No. One, without objection, within 10 days.Monetary sanctions requested by moving party:  Utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion is $860.00 (4.0 hours @ $200 per hour) [4 hours sought] plus $60 filing fee [Amount Requested $860.00], which sum is to be awarded in favor of defendant USC Verdugo Hills Hospital and against plaintiff Michael Lloyd, and plaintiff’s attorney of record, jointly and severally, payable within 30 days.  CCP sections 2030.290(c), 2023.010(d), 2023.030(a), and CRC Rule 3.1030(a).Defendant USC Verdugo Hills Hospital’s UNOPPOSED Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Defendant’s Special Interrogatories, Set One is GRANTED.  Plaintiff Michael Lloyd is ordered to serve verified responses to Defendant USC Verdugo Hills Hospital’s Special Interrogatories (Set One), without objection, within 10 days.Monetary sanctions requested by moving party:  Utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion is $860.00 (4.0 hours @ $200 per hour) [4 hours sought] plus $60 filing fee [Amount Requested $860.00], which sum is to be awarded in favor of defendant USC Verdugo Hills Hospital and against plaintiff Michael Lloyd, and plaintiff’s attorney of record, jointly and severally, payable within 30 days.  CCP sections 2030.290(c), 2023.010(d), 2023.030(a), and CRC Rule 3.1030(a).Defendant USC Verdugo Hills Hospital’s UNOPPOSED Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Defendant’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One is GRANTED.  Plaintiff Michael Lloyd is ordered to serve verified responses to Defendant USC Verdugo Hills Hospital’s Requests for Production of Documents (Set One), without objection, and to permit inspection and copying, within 10 days.Monetary sanctions requested by moving party:  Utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the pending motion is $860.00 (4.0 hours @ $200 per hour) [4 hours sought] plus $60 filing fee [Amount Requested $860.00], which sum is to be awarded in favor of defendant USC Verdugo Hills Hospital and against plaintiff Michael Lloyd, and plaintiff’s attorney of record, jointly and severally, payable within 30 days.  CCP §§ 2031.300(c), 2023.010(d), 2023.030(a) and CRC Rule 3.1030(a).DEPARTMENT D IS CONTINUING TO CONDUCT AND ENCOURAGE AUDIO OR VIDEO APPEARANCESPlease make arrangement in advance if you wish to appear via LACourtConnect by visiting www.lacourt.org to schedule a remote appearance.  Please note that LACourtConnect offers free audio and video appearances.  However, ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED. If no appearance is set up through LACourtConnect, or no appearance is otherwise made, then the Court will assume the parties are submitting on the tentative.
