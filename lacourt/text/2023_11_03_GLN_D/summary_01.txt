And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively continued the hearing on defendant E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company's motion for summary judgment or in the alternative summary adjudication. The motion is based on plaintiff David DeSoto's failure to respond at deposition with evidence concerning the substances to which he was exposed, and his purported inability to obtain evidence to support the essential element of his claims that moving defendant's product was one to which he was exposed. Plaintiff argued that he needs more time to conduct further discovery to obtain facts that would justify opposition to the motion. The judge finds that good cause exists to continue the hearing for a maximum period of sixty days, and will permit plaintiff to conduct further discovery into facts that would justify opposition to the motion. The hearing is continued to January 19, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.
