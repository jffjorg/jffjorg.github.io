And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a breach of contract action between Lightking America Technology (L.A.) LTD and Arbor CPA, APC, et al. The defendant, Zeming Qi, filed a motion to quash subpoenas, and/or for a protective order, which was opposed by the plaintiffs. The judge has denied the motion, finding that Qi's arguments are unpersuasive. The judge considered the factors to determine whether good cause has been shown to enforce the subpoena and found that the requested documents are adequately described and not overly broad, and that production of the requested materials would not violate Qi's privacy rights or intrude upon any protected governmental interest. The judge also noted that Qi's motion is speculative and lacks evidence that the subpoena will include his personal records.
