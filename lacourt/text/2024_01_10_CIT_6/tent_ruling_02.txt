Petition for Minor’s Compromise 
TENTATIVE RULING
The Court DENIES
the Petition for Minor’s Compromise
without prejudice. 
Petitioner is ordered to provide notice of the Court’s
ruling and file proof of service of same within five days of the Court’s order. 
BACKGROUND
This is an auto accident case. On January 12,
2023, plaintiffs Joanne Batch, Nicholas Batch, and Nathanael Batch, a minor, by
and through his Guardian Ad Litem, Joanne Batch (collectively, Plaintiffs), filed
this action against defendants Ruben Ambrose Acevedo (Ruben), Alissa Acevedo,
and Does 1 to 100, alleging causes of action for negligence (motor vehicle),
general negligence, negligent entrustment, and loss of consortium. 
On December 6, 2023, Nathanael Batch (Claimant),
a minor, by and through his Guardian Ad Litem, Joanne Batch (Petitioner), filed
this petition to confirm minor’s compromise. 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiffs have
agreed to settle their claims with Defendant in exchange for $175,000.00, $7,500.00 of which
will go to Claimant. If approved, $1,875.00 will be paid in attorney’s fees, $1,018.19
will be paid for reimbursement of case costs advanced by Claimant’s attorneys,
and $185.92 will be paid to The Rawlings Company as reimbursement of medical
expenses paid by Kaiser Permanente, leaving a balance of $4,420.89 for
Claimant, to be deposited into a blocked account. 
Court approval is required for
all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Probate Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) The
Court has reviewed the proposed settlement and finds the proposed attorney’s
fees, equaling 25% of Claimant’s settlement proceeds, to be fair and reasonable. 
However, the Court notes some
defects with the Petition. First, Petitioner has not filed a proof of service for
the Petition. Accordingly, the Court is unable to determine whether Petitioner
provided adequate notice to all parties involved in this action. 
Second, the Petition lists
Petitioner as having paid $1,875.00 in medical expenses. (Petition, ¶ 12, subd.
(b)(1).) However, this appears to be a typo since that is the same amount in
attorney’s fees to be paid out of Claimant’s share of the settlement proceeds.
It also conflicts with the rest of the Petition showing Claimant only paying
$185.92 in medical expenses. (Id., ¶ 12, subds. (a), (b).) 
Third, the Petition indicates
that $100,000.00 of the proposed settlement funds will be paid to Porter Batch,
who is not a party to this action. (See Petition, ¶ 11, subd. (b)(5); Compl.,
¶¶ 2-4.) While
paragraph 18 of the Complaint does mention “Porter” (Compl., ¶ 18), Porter’s
name is not listed anywhere else in the Complaint, so it is unclear who Porter
is or what Porter’s relation to this action is. Thus, there does not appear to be any basis for Porter
receiving the bulk of the proposed settlement proceeds. 
Fourth, paragraph 8 of the
Proposed Order (Form MC-351) does not correctly total the amounts to be
deducted from Claimant’s share of the proposed settlement. The Proposed Order
indicates $3,079.89 to be deducted, but the numbers add up instead to
$3,079.11. Also, Defendant Ruben’s name appears to be misspelled as “Rueben” in
paragraph 4 of the Proposed Order. (Form MC-351, ¶ 8.) 
Finally, the Order to Deposit
Funds in Blocked Account (Form MC-355) contains a couple of incomplete
paragraphs, namely paragraphs 1 and 5. Paragraph 1 fails to include the date,
time, and location for the hearing on the Petition, while paragraph 5 fails to
include Claimant’s date of birth. (Form MC-355, ¶¶1, 5.) 
Based on the foregoing, the Court
DENIES the Petition without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION
The Court
DENIES the Petition for Minor’s Compromise
without prejudice. 
Petitioner is ordered to provide notice of the Court’s
ruling and file proof of service of same within five days of the Court’s order.
