And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the petition for minor's compromise filed by Joanne Batch, guardian ad litem for her minor son Nathanael Batch, who was injured in an auto accident. The petition seeks to confirm a settlement agreement between the plaintiffs and defendant Ruben Ambrose Acevedo for $175,000.00. The court finds the proposed attorney's fees to be fair and reasonable, but denies the petition without prejudice due to several defects in the petition. These defects include inadequate notice to all parties, conflicting information in the petition, and an unexplained payment to Porter Batch, who is not a party to the action. The court orders the petitioner to provide notice of the court's ruling and file proof of service within five days of the order.
