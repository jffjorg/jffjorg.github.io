And here is a text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Defendant's counsel, Ralph G. Martinez's, motion to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed on August 13, 2024, and the judge has denied it due to the failure to submit required forms (MC-052 and MC-053) and failure to serve the defendant with copies of the motion papers. The judge also notes that the declaration submitted by counsel does not meet the requirements of California Rule of Court rule 3.1362. The judge has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, but such a motion should be granted only if there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.
