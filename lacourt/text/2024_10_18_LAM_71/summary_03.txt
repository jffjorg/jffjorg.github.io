And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Simplified Labor Staffing Solutions, Inc.'s motion to confirm the automatic stay pending the appeal of the court's denial of Defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The court found that a stay is not warranted, as the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) does not mandate a stay in state court proceedings pending an appeal concerning the application of the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (EFAA). The court also noted that the recent amendment to California law under C.C.P. §1294(a) empowers state courts to continue litigation even during such appeals, and that the Legislature's amendment to §1294(a) was aimed to curtail the abuse of the appeals process by defendants seeking to delay litigation without substantial justification. The court concluded that a stay is not necessary, and the instant matter will not be stayed pending the outcome of the appeal.
