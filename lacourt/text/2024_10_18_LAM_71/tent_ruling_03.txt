 Hearing Date:  October 18, 2024



 
Defendant Simplified
Labor Staffing Solutions, Inc.’s motion to confirm the automatic stay pending
the appeal of this Court’s denial of Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration is
denied.
 
Defendant Simplified Labor Staffing Solutions, Inc. (“SLSS”)
(“Defendant”) moves to confirm the automatic stay pending the appeal of this
Court’s denial of Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration.  (Notice Motion, pgs. 2-3; 9 U.S.C.
§16(a)(1)(B).)  Defendant moves on the
grounds that pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), as interpreted by Coinbase,
Inc. v. Bielski (2023) 599 U.S. 736, further trial court proceedings in this
action are automatically stayed pending resolution of Defendant’s appeal to the
Court of Appeal of the State of California, Second Appellate District, from the
Order entered March 21, 2024, denying Defendant’s Motion to Compel Arbitration
and to Stay Action.  (Notice Motion, pg.
2.)  Defendant also moves on the grounds
that California law also imposes an automatic stay of further trial court
proceedings in this action pending resolution of the interlocutory appeal.  (Notice Motion, pg. 2; see C.C.P.
§916(a); Prudential-Bache Securities, Inc. v. Superior Court (1988) 201
Cal.App.3d 924, 925; Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35
Cal.4th 180, 189.)
Defendant also moves in the alternative on the basis that
California law, due process and the interests of judicial economy require a
stay of further trial court proceedings pending resolution of the appeal.  (Notice Motion, pgs. 2-3; Landis v. North
American Co. (1936) 299 U.S. 248, 254.)
 
Background
On March 21, 2024, this Court
denied Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration of Plaintiff’s claims.  (3/21/24 Minute Order.)
On April 4, 2024, Defendant
filed its Notice of Appeal of this Court’s March 21, 2024, ruling.  (4/4/24 Notice of Appeal.)
Defendant filed the instant
motion on July 16, 2024.  Plaintiff filed
her opposition on October 7, 2024. 
Defendant filed its reply on October 14, 2024.
 
Discussion
Courts have broad discretion to
stay cases in the interest of efficiency and justice. Every court has the “inherent
power, in its discretion, to stay proceedings when such a stay will accommodate
the ends of justice.”  (See St. Paul Fire
and Marine Insurance Company v. AmerisourceBergen Corp. (2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 1, 6-7.)  The Code of Civil Procedure further empowers every court to “provide
for the orderly conduct of proceedings before it.” (C.C.P. §128(a)(3); see C.C.P. §187 [conferring on
courts and judicial officers “all the means necessary” to carry out their
jurisdiction].)
Here, a stay is not warranted.  The FAA does not mandate that a state court
stay litigation pending an appeal concerning whether the Ending Forced
Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (“EFAA”) applies.  Defendant relies heavily on Coinbase, Inc.
v. Bielski, 599 U.S. 736, 741-747 (2023), which specifically addresses the
procedures in federal district courts under the FAA.  Coinbase, Inc. does not address the
EFAA, nor does it specifically extend its requirements or language to state
trial courts.  The recent amendment to
California law under C.C.P. §1294(a) empowers state courts to continue
litigation even during such appeals.  The
amended statute now explicitly states that “[n]otwithstanding [C.C.P.] Section
916, the perfecting of such an appeal shall not automatically stay any
proceedings in the trial court during the pendency of the appeal” when dealing
with the denial or dismissal of a petition to compel arbitration.  (C.C.P. §1294(a).)  This legislative change eliminates the
presumption of an automatic stay in cases like this one, where a petition to
compel arbitration has been denied.  The
Legislature’s amendment to §1294(a) was aimed to curtail the abuse of the
appeals process by defendants seeking to delay litigation without substantial
justification.  (2023 S.B. No. 365,
California 2023-2024 Regular Session, pg. 1 of 12 [“Proponents of this bill
argue that corporate defendants are abusing the automatic stay when a motion to
compel arbitration is denied by the trial court and then appealed by the
defendant, using it as a delay tactic causing real harm to consumers and
workers. This bill provides that there shall be no stay of the proceedings when
an order dismissing or denying a motion to compel arbitration is appealed.”].)  Weighing public policy and the interests of
justice in a case involving a sensitive issue like sexual harassment, this
Court is disinclined to stay the instant matter.
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion to confirm the stay in this action pending the outcome of its
appeal of this Court’s March 21, 2024,
ruling is denied.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s motion to confirm the stay this action pending
the outcome of the appeal of this Court’s March 21, 2024, ruling is denied.
Moving Party to give notice.
