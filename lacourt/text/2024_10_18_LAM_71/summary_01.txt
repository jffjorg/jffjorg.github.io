And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from the defendant's person most knowledgeable (PMK) at deposition and to requests for production of documents (RFPs). The defendant is ordered to produce a PMK for deposition by October 25, 2024. The court also finds that the defendant's boilerplate objections are not proper and may be sanctionable. However, the court denies the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,160.00 because the Notice of Motion failed to provide sufficient notice to the defendant of the amount of the sanction and against whom the sanctions were requested. The court orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling.
