          Plaintiff Mir Rafiq (“Rafiq”) (“Plaintiff”)
moves to compel further responses from Defendant Mercedes-Benz
USA, LLC’s (“MBUSA”) (“Defendant”) Person Most Knowledgeable (“PMK”)
at deposition and to her Request for Production of Documents (Set
One) (“RFA”) to request Nos. 1,
2, 3, 7, 8, 15, 16, 23, 24, 29, 30, 39, 40, 51, 52, 55, 56, 61, 62, 71, 72, 73,
74, 75, 76, 82, 83, 88, 90, 92, 101, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 132, 133,
136, 137, 142, and 143 (“Requests”) and production of all responsive documents
corresponding to those requests, and to strike Defendant’s objections.  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §§2025.450,
2025.480.)  Plaintiff requests
Defendant pay monetary sanctions of an unspecified amount.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 1.)
 
Meet and Confer
Plaintiff fails to indicate she complied with the
Court’s requirement to attempt to resolve this discovery dispute via an IDC.  (See Information Regarding Procedures
in Department 71 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse §5(E).)  This is grounds to continue the instant
motion until an IDC is held.  
However, based on Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration,
despite Plaintiff’s numerous attempts to meet and confer with Defendant’s
counsel, Defendant has been unresponsive. 
(See Decl. of Stoliker ¶¶23-27, Exhs. 6-10.)  Therefore, the Court will consider the
instant motion.
 
Background
          On August
22, 2024, Plaintiff electronically served its Amended Noitce of Deposition of
the PMK and Demand to Produce Documents at Deposition.  (Decl. of Stoliker ¶17, Exh. 4.)  On or about August 28, 2024, Defendant served
boilerplate objections to each matter for examination.  (See Decl. of Stolkier ¶18, Exh. 5.)  Plaintiff declares that as of the date of this
motion, Defendant has refused to produce its PMK witness on all the categories
proffered by Plaintiff and failed produce all documents.  (Decl. of Stoliker ¶21.)
          Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on October 1, 2024. 
Defendant filed its opposition on October 14, 2024.  Plaintiff filed her reply on October 15,
2024.
 
          Discussion
The Civil Discovery Act provides that a “party may
obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of any
motion made in that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in
evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.”  (C.C.P. §2031.010.)

“[E]vidence is ‘relevant’ if it might reasonably
assist a party in evaluating its case, preparing for trial, or facilitating a
settlement.”  (Moore v. Mercer (2016)
4 Cal.App.5th 424, 447.)  A party is
entitled to discover “any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action.”  (C.C.P. §2017.010.)  The phrase “subject matter” is broader than
relevancy to the issues (which determines admissibility of evidence at trial).  (Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. v. Superior
Court (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1384, 1392.)  Courts have uniformly held that, for discovery
purposes, information should be regarded as “relevant” to the subject matter if
it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial,
or facilitating settlement.  (Stewart
v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1013.)
“The service of a deposition notice . . . is
effective to require any deponent who is a party to the action . . . to attend
and to testify, as well as to produce any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing for inspection and copying.”  (C.C.P. §2025.280(a).)  The deposition of a non-natural person (i.e.,
corporation) may be noticed by describing “with reasonable particularity the
matters on which examination is requested” and the deponent “shall designate
and produce at the deposition those of its officers, directors, managing
agents, employees, or agents who are most qualified to testify on its behalf.”  (C.C.P. §2025.230.)
If, after service of a deposition notice, a party
(or a witness designated on behalf of such party) fails to appear for
deposition, the party seeking the deposition may move to compel the deposition.
 (C.C.P. §2025.450(a); see Doppes v.
Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 973-974 [ordering manufacturer
in Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act case to produce a person most qualified
and documents concerning other customer complaints of the same defect in the
same year, make, model vehicle].)
Plaintiff moves to compel further responses from Defendant’s
PMK and that Defendant produce documents at deposition concerning: (A) The
Subject Vehicle (i.e., RFP Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 8); (B) Internal Knowledge and
Investigation related to the Steering and Electrical Defects in 2019 Mercedes
Benz GLE Coupe vehicles (i.e., RFP Nos. 15, 16, 23, 24, 29, 30, 39, 40, 51, 52,
55, 56, 61, 62, 71, 72); (C) Summaries, Memoranda, and PowerPoints related to
the Steering and Electrical Defects in 2019 Mercedes Benz GLE Coupe vehicles
(i.e., RFP Nos. 73, 74, 75, 76, 82, 83); (D) Policies and Procedures related to
the Song Beverly Act (i.e. RFP Nos. 88, 90, 92, 101); (E) Communication With
Governmental Agencies and Suppliers related to the Defects in 2019 Mercedes
Benz GLE Coupe vehicles (i.e., RFP Nos. 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120); (F)
Production of Documents and Deposition Testimony in Class Action(s) (i.e. RFP
No. 132, 133, 136, 137) and (G) Other Documents Related To The Subject
Vehicle’s Defects (i.e. RFP No. 142, 143).  (Decl. of Stoliker ¶29.)
 
A.   Request Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8
These requests seek production of documents
concerning the Subject Vehicle and are narrowly tailored to a specific issue in
this case.  The requested documents are
relevant to the issues related to Defendant’s good faith compliance with the
Song-Beverly Act, including breach of the implied warranty of merchantability.
Defendant’s responses are not Code-Compliant. Defendant’s
boilerplate objections are not proper.  (See
Korea Data Systems Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 51 Cal.App.4th 1513, 1516 [stating
boilerplate objections “[lack] . . . the specificity the statute mandates” and
their use may be sanctionable].)  To the
extent documents are withheld due to an objection, the response must (1)
identify with particularity the document to which the objection is being made;
and (2) set forth the grounds for the objection, including the production of a
privilege log if the objection is based on privilege.  (C.C.P. §2031.240.)
Defendant only asserts objections and refuses to
comply to every Category and every RFP; Defendant has failed to identify with
particularity any document, tangible thing, land, or electronically stored
information falling within any category of item in the demand to which an
objection is being made; and when objecting based upon privilege or attorney
work product, Defendant has failed to provide sufficient factual information
for other parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including, if
necessary, a privilege log—all in violation of §2031.230.
Accordingly, Defendant is compelled to produce its
PMK and Code-Compliant responses to RFP Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8 and
corresponding documents.  To the extent
any responses are protected by privilege, Defendant is to produce a privilege
log.
 
B.    Request Nos. 15, 16, 23, 24, 29, 30, 39,
40, 51, 52, 55, 56, 61, 62, 71, and 72
These requests pertain to internal knowledge and investigation
related to the steering and electrical Defects in 2019 Mercedes Benz GLE Coupe
vehicles.  This request is narrowly
tailored towards the applicable policies and procedures related to Plaintiff’s
claims.
Defendant’s responses are not Code-Compliant.  Defendant’s boilerplate objections are not
proper.
Accordingly, Defendant is compelled to produce its
PMK and Code-Compliant responses to RFP Nos. 15, 16, 23, 24, 29, 30, 39, 40,
51, 52, 55, 56, 61, 62, 71, and 72 and corresponding documents.  To the extent any responses are protected by
privilege, Defendant is to produce a privilege log.
 
C.    Request Nos. 73, 74, 75, 76, 82, and 83
These requests pertain to summaries, memoranda, and PowerPoints
related to the steering and electrical defects in 2019 Mercedes Benz GLE Coupe
vehicles. 
Defendant’s responses are not Code-Compliant. Defendant’s
boilerplate objections are not proper.
Accordingly, Defendant is compelled to produce its
PMK and Code-Compliant responses to RFP Nos. 73, 74, 75, 76, 82, and 83 and
corresponding documents.  To the extent
any responses are protected by privilege, Defendant is to produce a privilege
log.
 
D.   Request Nos. 88, 90, 92, and 101
These requests pertain to documents policies and
procedures related to the Song Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. This request is
narrowly tailored towards the specific issues in the case.
Defendant’s responses are not Code-Compliant. Defendant’s
boilerplate objections are not proper.
Accordingly, Defendant is compelled to produce its
PMK and Code-Compliant responses to RFP Nos. 88, 90, 92, and 101 and
corresponding documents.  To the extent
any responses are protected by privilege, Defendant is to produce a privilege
log.
 
E.    Request Nos. 115, 116, 117, 118, 119,
and 120
These requests seek communications between Defendant
and any government agencies or suppliers regarding defects in 2019
Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe vehicles. This request is narrowly tailored towards the
specific issues in the case.
Defendant’s responses are not Code-Compliant. Defendant’s
boilerplate objections are not proper.
Accordingly, Defendant is compelled to produce its
PMK and Code-Compliant responses to RFP Nos. 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, and 120 and
corresponding documents.  To the extent
any responses are protected by privilege, Defendant is to produce a privilege
log.
 
F.     Request Nos. 132, 133, 136, and 137
 These requests
seek all document production and deposition testimony produced in class actions.
These requests are narrowly tailored towards the specific issues in the case.

boilerplate objections are not proper.
Accordingly, Defendant is compelled to produce its
PMK and Code-Compliant responses to RFP Nos. 132, 133, 136, and 137 and
corresponding documents.  To the extent
any response is protected by privilege, Defendant is to produce a privilege

PMK and Code-Compliant responses to RFP Nos. 142 and 143 and corresponding
documents.  To the extent any response is
protected by privilege, Defendant is to produce a privilege log.
 
Sanctions
Under C.C.P. §2031.300(c), “[t]he court may impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling a response, the
court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue
sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to this sanction,
the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010).”  (C.C.P. §2031.300(c).)
Plaintiff requests sanctions in the amount of $3,160.00
against Defendant.  (Decl. of Stoliker ¶38.)  However, Plaintiff’s Notice of Motion failed
to provide sufficient notice to Defendant of the amount of the sanction and
against whom the sanctions were requested. 
(C.C.P. §2023.040.)  Therefore,
this Court cannot grant the requested sanctions.

motion to compel further responses from Defendant’s PMK at deposition and to
RFP Nos. 1,
2, 3, 7, 8, 15, 16, 23, 24, 29, 30, 39, 40, 51, 52, 55, 56, 61, 62, 71, 72, 73,
74, 75, 76, 82, 83, 88, 90, 92, 101, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 132, 133,
136, 137, 142, and 143 granted.  Defendant
