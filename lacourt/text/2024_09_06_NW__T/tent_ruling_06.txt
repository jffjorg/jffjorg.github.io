 Case Number:  BC604858    Hearing Date:   September 6, 2024    Dept:  T RELIANT V COOPER BC604858 Tentative rulings:Papers filed by non-parties are not considered by the court. Motion by receiver to pool  trust assets and aggregate investor interests:  Denied.  There is no authority in the trust for the  forfeited fractional interests to be pooled as collateral or funding.  The trust agreement as Section 3.3  specifically has a process for forfeited fractional shares: they must first be  offered to other shareholders in that series to determine whether they are  willing to pay the amount in default and future premiums due and, if not, they  are to be reverted to the grantor.    There is no provision in the trust for Reliant to pay the lapsed  premiums nor to force the other fractional shareholders to pay.    Motion by Cooper (1)  Directing payment towards partial satisfaction of judgment; (2) Directing  assignment of forfeited interests to pay off balance of judgment; (3) Directing  receiver to maintain partial interests assigned to the Cooper parties; and (4) to  order receiver to retain Cooper's interests: 1-Grant. Section 4.1(j) allows  the trustee solely from the trust assets to indemnify employees and officers,  successor grantor, and its agents.  The  court previously found that Reliant and Mr. Grady are alter egos of each  other.  Accordingly, the trust is  required to indemnify Reliant and Mr. Grady and make trust assets available to pay  the judgment against Mr. Grady and Reliant.   Therefore, the receiver is directed to instruct the trustee to sell such  trust assets as are necessary to satisfy the Cooper judgment in full.   2-The receiver is directed to  comply with Section 3.3 as to forfeited shares, identify those and, if there is  no acceptance of liability for the payment of premiums for those shares from  other shareholders in that series, transfer them to Mr. Cooper in partial  satisfaction of his judgment.  Reliant is  solely responsible to obtain the value of those share through a neutral.  This is a reminder that the court has already  ordered forfeited shares to be signed over to Mr. Cooper.  It is the court's recollection that the  Receiver indicated there have never been any forfeited shares.  The court inquires how it is possible that  there are no forfeited shares and if not, who paid the defaulted premiums, and  under what authority. 3-Grant. 4-Grant (already done). Motion to confirm  resignation of Bank of Utah as Successor Trustee: Denied without prejudice.  The trust agreement Section 4.11(b)(i) states  that the resignation is effective only upon the appointment of a successor  trustee.  There has been no appointment  of a successor trustee.  Section 4.10  states that the Trustee is required to be a bank or trust company.  There is no provision for an individual  trustee.   ______________________________________________________________________________ Alternatively:  The court directs Receiver to seek a legal  opinion to advise whether the “Second Amended and Restated Agreement and  Declaration of Trust” is valid.   The court's query is based upon  the following factors of concern: 1. The reason for this inquiry is  that the Successor Grantor is identified as "RLS, Grantor, LLC, a  California limited liability company" in the preamble, of which there is  no such entity in California.  “RLS,  Grantor, LLC, a California limited liability company” is not referred to  anywhere else in the body of the agreement. 2. The signatories to the  agreement are:  "Reliant Life  Shares, LLC, as Successor Grantor" signed by Scott L. Grady and  "Reliant Life Shares, LLC, as Original Grantor" signed by Scott L.  Grady.  Of note: there is no signature  for "RLS, Grantor, LLC, a California limited liability company." 3. It would appear that if  "RLS, Grantor, LLC, a California limited liability company" never  existed, then it could not have been the Successor Grantor.  If the agreement is not signed by anyone for  "RLS, Grantor, LLC, a California limited liability company" it would  also appear that the agreement may not be effective, in which case the last  trust agreement may control.  The lack of  an entity in California called "RLS, Grantor, LLC, a California limited  liability company" and the lack of a signature for "RLS, Grantor,  LLC, a California limited liability company" may be sufficient to find  that the agreement is invalid. 4. In light of the Third Amended  Judgment and the Irrevocable Resolution of Reliant Life Shares, LLC, the court  queries whether Mr. Grady had the authority to change the grantor of the Trust  away from Reliant to his own solely held LLC, if that is what “RLS, Grantor,  LLC” is purported to be and if that was the intent of the Second Amended trust  agreement.
