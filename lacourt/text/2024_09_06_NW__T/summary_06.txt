Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the matters presented at the upcoming court hearing. First, the judge denied the motion by the receiver to pool trust assets and aggregate investor interests, finding that there is no authority in the trust agreement for the forfeited fractional interests to be pooled as collateral or funding. The judge also denied the motion by Cooper to direct payment towards partial satisfaction of judgment, finding that there is no provision in the trust agreement for Reliant to pay the lapsed premiums nor to force other fractional shareholders to pay.

The judge granted Cooper's motion to direct the receiver to maintain partial interests assigned to the Cooper parties and to order the receiver to retain Cooper's interests. The judge also granted Cooper's motion to direct the receiver to sell trust assets necessary to satisfy the Cooper judgment in full, finding that the trust is required to indemnify Reliant and Mr. Grady and make trust assets available to pay the judgment against Mr. Grady and Reliant.

The judge denied the motion to confirm the resignation of Bank of Utah as Successor Trustee without prejudice, finding that the resignation is effective only upon the appointment of a successor trustee. The judge also directed the receiver to seek a legal opinion to advise whether the "Second Amended and Restated Agreement and Declaration of Trust" is valid, citing concerns about the identity of the Successor Grantor, the lack of a signature for "RLS, Grantor, LLC, a California limited liability company", and the possibility that the agreement may not be effective if "RLS, Grantor, LLC, a California limited liability company" never existed.
