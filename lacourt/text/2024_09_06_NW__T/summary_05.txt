And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses three motions to compel discovery responses filed by defendant Maya Logrinsky against plaintiff Laura Nazeri. The motions requested that the plaintiff serve verified responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The defendant also requested monetary sanctions of $572.00 from the plaintiff and her counsel. The court assumes that a good-faith meet and confer took place, as directed by the court, but notes that there is no evidence that the meet and confer actually occurred. The court grants the defendant's motions and orders the plaintiff to serve verified responses to the discovery demands without objections within 20 days. The court also grants the defendant's request for monetary sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel in the amount of $572.00. The sanctions are payable jointly and severally by the plaintiff and her counsel to the client trust account of the moving party's counsel by October 6, 2024.
