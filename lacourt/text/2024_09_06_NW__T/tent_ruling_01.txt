  Case Number:  22VECV00768    Hearing Date:   September 6, 2024    Dept:  T 22VECV00768
Liberatore v The 4455 Fulton
 
Tentative
ruling:  The court denies the ex parte application
to compel discovery.  The discovery was
served by a suspended corporation.  Until
it is revived, it does not have the ability to serve discovery.  Therefore, Farmers cannot enforce the served
discovery.
 
Now that
Farmers has come into the case to defend the action, the court would be
inclined to continue the trial date as Ms. Liberatore did not ask the court to
stay the proceedings until the defendant resolved its tax suspension as is
usually done. The court would grant a 3-4 month continuance with extension of
the discovery cutoff. Ms. Liberatore must recognize that she will be required
to appear for a deposition, and she will be required to answer interrogatories
and other discovery, which is standard.  Failure to do so has serious
consequences including the possibility of dismissal of the complaint.  
 
Finally, in
reviewing this matter, one of the causes of action is for cancellation of the
deeds reflecting the foreclosure and sale of plaintiff’s home. The trial of
that matter will be to the court as plaintiff is seeking equitable relief.
However, it is the court’s understanding from the defense that title to the
home is not in the name of the plaintiff or defendant.  If the home has been sold to a third party,
the third party has a right to object to the cancellation of their deed, but
they have not been added as a party to this case.  The court cannot render a decision that
affects the third parties’ rights if they are not in this case.  Even if Ms. Liberatore takes the position
that these transfers are void, the court cannot make that determination unless
the current owners of the property are in this case.  They have a right to be heard and to oppose
the cancellation proceedings.
 
The court will discuss this at the hearing on 9/6/2024.
