And here is the summary in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Liberatore v. The 4455 Fulton. The court has denied the ex parte application to compel discovery, as the discovery was served by a suspended corporation, which does not have the ability to serve discovery until revived. The court has also decided to continue the trial date, with a 3-4 month continuance and extension of the discovery cutoff. The plaintiff, Ms. Liberatore, will be required to appear for a deposition and answer interrogatories, and failure to do so could result in the dismissal of the complaint.

The court has also considered the issue of the cancellation of deeds reflecting the foreclosure and sale of the plaintiff's home. The court has determined that the trial of this matter will be to the court, as the plaintiff is seeking equitable relief. However, the court has also noted that the title to the home is not in the name of the plaintiff or defendant, and that a third party has a right to object to the cancellation of their deed. The court cannot render a decision that affects the third parties' rights if they are not in the case.

The court will discuss this matter further at the hearing on September 6, 2024.
