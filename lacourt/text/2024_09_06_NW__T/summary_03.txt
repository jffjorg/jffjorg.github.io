Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, PA Rehearsal Studios, Inc., has moved for judgment on the pleadings against the plaintiff, Brian Whitaker, alleging two causes of action: violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act and violation of the Disabled Persons Act. The defendant argues that the plaintiff lacks standing because he did not experience any difficulty, discomfort, or embarrassment and because the defendant does not have a bona fide intent to use its services. The court has denied the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings because the allegations in the plaintiff's complaint are sufficient to allege standing. The court has also granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of certain exhibits, but denied it as to one exhibit. The court notes that the defendant failed to submit a declaration showing compliance with the meet and confer requirement, which is a defect that is grounds for denying the motion.
