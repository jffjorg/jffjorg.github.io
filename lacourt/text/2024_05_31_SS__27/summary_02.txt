And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is responding to a motion filed by the defendant to continue the trial. The defendant argues that the court should have granted its ex parte application to continue the trial, just as it granted the plaintiff's ex parte application to continue the trial due to an attorney medical issue. However, the judge disagrees, stating that the defendant's application was not filed in accordance with the court's rules. The judge notes that the defendant could have simply filed the stipulation for a continuance, assuming it contained good cause, and the court would have granted it. The judge also refers to the court's Eighth Amended Standing Order, which indicates that motions will not be advanced in the P.I. Hub. The judge concludes that the defendant's current motion suffers from the same failure to comply with the rules as its previous ex parte application.
