This tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings.

The court notes that if parties intend to submit to the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number, including the hearing date and time, counsel's contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.
