And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to compel further discovery responses and requests for sanctions. The ruling states that the plaintiff needs to participate in an informal discovery conference (IDC) with the defendant to resolve any outstanding discovery disputes before filing a motion to compel further responses. The judge also notes that objections are a form of discovery responses and that the defendant's unverified responses, consisting only of objections, constitute a response. The judge orders the parties to participate in an IDC before the hearing date to resolve any outstanding discovery disputes.
