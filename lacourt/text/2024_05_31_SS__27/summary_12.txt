And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to quash subpoenas for medical records, limiting the subpoenas to medical records relating to the plaintiff's bilateral knee, low back, and lower extremities injuries. The court finds that the defendant has not shown "good cause" for production of medical records unrelated to the plaintiff's injuries. The parties are ordered to meet and confer concerning mutually agreeable language for modified subpoenas before they are propounded. If the parties are unable to agree, they are ordered to schedule an informal discovery conference to resolve any remaining issues.
