vs CITY OF INGLEWOOD, et al.

Notice: Sufficient¿ 
Ruling: THE COURT WILL ADDRESS THE MOTION TO ADVANCE
HEARING DATE ON MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT WITH THE PARTIES
 
On December 19, 2019,
Plaintiff filed the present premises liability case. On December 19, 2023,
Defendant CONSOLIDATED DISPOSAL SERVICE, LLC filed and personally served its
motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff and reserved the earliest hearing date
for the motion on March 12, 2025. When the motion for summary judgment was
filed, the trial was set for April 3, 2024, but it has since been continued to
the current trial date of September 18, 2024.[1]
Defendant now moves the Court to hear its motion for summary judgment 30 days
before the current trial date.
Numerous courts of
appeal have held that a trial court cannot refuse to consider a motion for
summary judgment that is timely filed. "A trial court may not refuse to
hear a summary judgment filed within the time limits of [Code of Civil
Procedure] section 437c. [Citation.] Local rules and practices may not be
applied so as to prevent the filing and hearing of such a motion." (Sentry
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529); accord, First
State Inc. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 324, 330 [invalidating
case management order to the extent it precluded filing motions pursuant to
section 437c ]; Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d
918, 923 [local court rule that "require a party filing a complex summary
judgment motion to file the motion six months before the date set for trial is
void and unenforceable because it is inconsistent with section 437c"].) As
the Sentry court explained: "We are sympathetic to the problems the
trial courts experience in calendaring and hearing the many motions for summary
judgment. However, the solution to these problems cannot rest in a refusal to
hear timely motions." (Sentry, supra , at p. 530.) 
Defendant filed and personally
served its motion for summary judgment on December 19, 2023 (Ex. A and B to
Reply), with the then trial date set for April 3, 2024. The motion was served
more than 105 days prior to trial; therefore, it was timely filed, and the
Court cannot refuse to hear a timely filed motion for summary judgment.
The Court’s calendar is
congested. Defendant was unable to secure a hearing date earlier than the trial
date because, as stated in its motion, the earliest available date for the
Court to hear the motion was March 12, 2025. The Court will address scheduling
with the parties.
