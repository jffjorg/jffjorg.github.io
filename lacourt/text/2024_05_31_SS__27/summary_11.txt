And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Lee S. Arian regarding a motion to deem requests for admissions, set one, admitted. The plaintiff, Jaheim Martin, filed a dog bite case on April 26, 2023. The defendant, Malin Asset Management, served requests for admissions on December 7, 2023. However, the plaintiff failed to respond to the requests by the statutory deadline. Despite a meet and confer letter sent by the defendant on January 19, 2024, the plaintiff still failed to respond. As a result, the defendant moved to deem the requests for admissions, set one, admitted. The court finds that the plaintiff waived any objections and that the defendant's motion is granted.
