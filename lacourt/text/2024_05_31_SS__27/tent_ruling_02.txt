[1] In its Reply,
Defendant bemoans the fact that the Court denied its ex parte
application to continue trial brought on February 15, 2024, which was based on
a stipulation, but the Court later granted Plaintiff’s ex parte to continue
trial based on an attorney medical issue. 
Defendant need simply understand the rules related to ex partes
to understand the Court’s ruling.  There
is no reason to bring a stipulation as an ex parte unless, for instance,
the trial is within a few days of the stipulation. 
That was not the case here.  So,
there was no basis under the ex parte rules to file the ex parte and
it was on that basis that the Court denied the ex parte.  Defendant could have simply filed the
stipulation, and, assuming it contained good cause for a continuance, the Court
would have granted it.
 
Defendant’s
current motion essentially suffers from the same failure to comply with the rules.  This Court’s Eighth Amended Standing Order indicates
that motions will not be advanced in the P.I Hub.  Yet, that is exactly what Defendant requests.
