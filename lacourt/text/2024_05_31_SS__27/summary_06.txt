And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling discusses two motions: (1) the motion to compel mental examination of the plaintiff, and (2) the motion to seal the record. The judge grants the motion to compel mental examination, ruling that the defendant must provide notice of the tests to be performed, permit the defendant's neuropsychologist to explore relevant cognitive and psychiatric histories, and provide raw data to the plaintiff's counsel for cross-examination. The judge also rules that the audio recording of the testing portion be provided to the plaintiff's counsel. The judge denies the motion to seal the record, finding that the motion did not provide sufficient facts to justify sealing the record.
