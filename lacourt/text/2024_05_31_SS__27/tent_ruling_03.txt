CASE NO./NAME: 20STCV11485 KELLY
DUANGRUDEESWAT vs LONG BEACH TRANSIT 
Moving Party: Plaintiff 
Responding Party: Defendant Long Beach Transit
Notice: Sufficient¿ 
Ruling: MOTIONS TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES
AND REQUESTS FOR SANCTIONS ARE GRANTED.
 
On March 31, 2023,
Plaintiff served her Requests for Production, Set Two, and Special
Interrogatories, Set One, on Defendant Long Beach Public Transportation
Company. Defendant did not serve the discovery responses by the statutory
deadline. Plaintiff gave Defendant several extensions with a final response
deadline of June 15, 2023. Defendant alleges in the moving papers that it did
not receive any discovery response until October 4, 2023. Defendant argues that
the response received on October 4, 2023, showing that Defendant allegedly
served the responses by mail on June 15, 2023, was falsified. Therefore,
Defendant failed to serve timely discovery responses and has waived its
objections. Plaintiff now moves the Court to compel Defendant to provide
further discovery responses to the discovery requests at issue without
objections.
Plaintiff has met the
meet and confer requirement and the parties have attended an IDC on 1/2/24. Plaintiff
argues that Defendant falsified service of the discovery responses for the
following reasons: First, the proof of service showed that the responses were
served by mail, contrary to the parties' usual practice of serving by email.
Second, both attorneys at the address listed on the proof of service did not
receive any mail from Defendant. Third, from June 2023 to October 2023,
Plaintiff continued to email Defendant about the outstanding discovery
responses but received no communication from Defendant that the discovery
responses were allegedly served in June 2023 until October 2023. Fourth, the
metadata on the PDF showed that the discovery responses were created in October
2023, not June 2023, when the discovery responses were allegedly served. For
these reasons, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant falsified the proof of service
and did not actually mail Plaintiff the discovery responses in June 2023. 
Defendant did not file
an opposition contesting Plaintiff’s allegations. Failure to file an opposition can be
construed as a presumption that defendant has no meritorious
argument(s). (See Southern California Gas Co. v. Flannery
(2016), 5 Cal. App. 5th 476, 483, fn.7 (lack of opposition waives
arguments); Sexton v. Superior Court (1997), 58 Cal. App. 4th
1403, 1410).  
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds Defendant
did not timely serve the discovery responses at issue and therefore waived all
of its objections. (CCP § 2031.300(a); CCP §
2030.290(a).)  Accordingly, Defendant is hereby ORDERED
to serve complete discovery responses to Plaintiff’s special interrogatories,
set one and requests for production, set two, without objections within 20 days
of today.
Plaintiff requests sanctions in the amount of
$2,620.00 for the two motions, which the Court finds reasonable to compensate
Plaintiff for incurring attorney's fees in bringing forth these discovery
motions. Defendant and its counsel are ORDERED to pay, jointly and severally sanctions of $2,620 to Plaintiff within 20 days
of today’s date.
