And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Teresa Guzzardo's motion to consolidate two cases: 22STCV14904 ( TERESA GUZZARDO vs SYMONE GALLEGOS) and 22STCV08263 (TG vs Jiffy Lube and Alamitos Enterprises). The two cases arise from the same incident and share substantial common facts. The court finds that consolidation will streamline the resolution of related factual disputes and legal questions, such as whether Gallegos was drinking and driving within the scope of her employment. The court also finds that witnesses and evidence will overlap, making separate trials redundant and inefficient. The court grants the motion to consolidate, despite objections from the Corporate Defendants, citing concerns about conducting discovery and having motions for summary judgment heard. The court sets a hearing date of May 31, 2024, and advises parties to submit their intentions to the court by email.
