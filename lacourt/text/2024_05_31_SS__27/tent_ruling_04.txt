MOTION TO ADVANCE THE HEARING ON ITS MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT 
Hearing Date: 5/31/24¿ 
CASE NO./NAME: 21STCV09514 LORIELLE HALL, et
al. vs LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL
Moving Party: Defendant Los Angeles Unified
School District
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient¿ 
Ruling: MOTION TO ADVANCE THE HEARING ON ITS
MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT IS GRANTED.
 
On March 10, 2021, Plaintiff filed
the present case. On April 17, 2024, Defendant filed its motion for summary
judgment (MSJ) with a hearing date set for March 5, 2025. The trial date is
currently set for October 23, 2024. Defendant moves the Court to advance the
MSJ hearing date to 30 days before the trial date of October 23, 2024. No
opposition was filed.
 
The Court’s calendar is congested.
Defendant was unable to secure a hearing date earlier than the trial date
because, as stated in its motion, the earliest available date for the Court to
hear the motion was March 4, 2025. However, allowing Defendant’s MSJ to be
heard constitutes good cause for the Court to continue the trial date.
 
Accordingly, the Court hereby
continues the trial to April
[6 or later], 2025 at 8:30 am, and FSC is set for _____, 2025 at 10:00 am.
Fact discovery will not follow the new trial date; should the parties elect to
have fact discovery follow the new trial date, a stipulation or motion must be
filed.
