 Case Number:  22VECV00975    Hearing Date:   February 29, 2024    Dept:  T Creditors
v Perera 22VECV00975
[TENTATIVE]
ORDER:  Defendant/Judgment Debtor Francis
L. Perera’s Claim of Exemption is DENIED. 

Introduction

            Defendant/Judgment
Debtor Francis L. Perera (Defendant) claimed an exemption to Plaintiff/Judgment
Creditor’s efforts to enforce the judgment. 
Judgement was entered against Defendant on February 2, 2023 in the amount
of $38,281.21.  A writ of execution
provided that the total owed is now $41,151.49.

            Discussion

            Per the writ of execution, Plaintiff
enforced the judgment by obtaining a levy against Defendant’s bank
account.  Defendant asserted that the
levied funds are exempted from enforcement pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure,
sections 704.070 [paid earnings exemption] and 706.050 [maximum amount under an
earnings withholding order], and 15 U.S.C. 1673(a) [maximum amount under a
garnishment].  Defendant further asserted
financial hardship and submitted a Financial Statement form.
            Defendant’s claim to exemption under
section 706.050 and 15 U.S.C. 1673(a) are inapplicable because the levied funds
in the bank account are not shown to be wages or earnings. 
            Further, Defendant’s claim to
exemption under section 704.070 is insufficient because Defendant failed to
present evidentiary support that the funds in the bank account are to be
considered “paid earnings” as defined in section 706.011 (i.e., the claimed
earnings were paid within 30 days of the levy.) 
(Section 704.070(a)(2).)  Further,
Defendant failed to trace the funds to exempt property.  
As
to Defendant’s Financial Hardship exemption, funds in a natural person's
deposit account may be exempt, and the judgment debtor may file a claim of
exemption to release the funds from the execution levy. Funds in a judgment
debtor’s deposit account are exempt to the extent necessary for the support of
the judgment debtor.  (section
704.225.)  Defendant asserted that his
spouse’s earnings of $6,000.00 is from self-employment and they have real and
personal property assets valued at approximately $315,700.00.  Defendant’s claimed monthly expenses amount
to $13,811.00.  Defendant’s Financial
Statement shows that Defendant is in a financially difficult situation when
only considering Defendant’s liquid assets. 
However, when considering the financial hardship exemption, the Court
considers all property of the debtor and the debtor’s spouse, not just
Defendant’s liquid assets.  (Section
703.115.)  When considering all
assets/property of the debtor and the debtor’s spouse, the Court does not find
Defendant’s financial hardship exemption to be persuasive.
Defendant’s
claim of exemption is DENIED.
