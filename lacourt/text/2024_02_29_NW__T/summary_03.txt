The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and a request for production (RFP). The court grants certain requests, including production of actual policies in effect in California, but denies others due to overbreadth and lack of limitation to the issues in this case. The court finds that the defendant has complied with some requests, but not all. The hearing date is set for February 29, 2024. The court orders the defendant to provide answers to special interrogatories and produce documents without objection, with certain limitations.
