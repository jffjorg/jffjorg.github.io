And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by Defendant and Cross-Defendant US Bus Charter & Limo Inc. (Coachways) to file Cross-Complaints against Cross-Defendants The Universal Church, Inc. and TIB Transportation Insurance Brokers (TIB). The proposed Cross-Complaints allege claims for equitable indemnity against TIB, contribution against TIB, and declaratory relief against The Universal Church, Inc. and TIB. Coachways moved to file the Cross-Complaints under Code of Civil Procedure sections 379(a) and 389(a)(1), arguing that the claims are related to the subject matter of the complaint and/or arise out of the plaintiff's claimed series of transactions/occurrences. The Court granted the motion, finding that Coachways sufficiently showed grounds to allow the motion and that the delay in bringing the motion is insufficient to show bad faith. The Court also noted that defenses to the merits of the claims are better reviewed by other motions and that an amendment adding legal theories damaging to the opposing party on the merits is not a type of cognizable prejudice in support of denying leave to amend.
