TENTATIVE
RULING
 



DEPT:


32




HEARING DATE:


May
  30, 2024




CASE NUMBER:


22STCV25044




MOTIONS:  


Motion
  to Compel Physical Examination of Defendant




MOVING PARTY:


Plaintiff Ciara M. 




OPPOSING PARTY:


Defendant
  Jeremey Ellis 



 
 
MOTION
 
            On August 3, 2022, Plaintiff Ciara M.
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendant Jeremey Ellis (“Defendant”)
for intentional misrepresentation, and negligence regarding the sexual
transmission of a disease. Defendant filed an answer on January 27, 2023.  
 
             Plaintiff now moves to compel a physical
examination of Defendant that entails providing a blood sample to test for a
herpes simplex virus, the disease at issue in this case. Defendant opposes and
Plaintiff replies.  
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“In any case in
which a plaintiff is seeking recovery for personal injuries, any defendant may
demand one physical examination of the plaintiff, if both of the following
conditions are satisfied: (1) The examination does not include any diagnostic
test or procedure that is painful, protracted, or intrusive. (2) The examination
is conducted at a location within 75 miles of the residence of the examinee.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.220, subd. (a).)¿¿¿ 
 
“If any
party desires to obtain discovery by a physical examination other than that
described in Article 2 (commencing with Section 2032.210), or by a mental
examination, the party shall obtain leave of court.  A motion for an examination under subdivision
(a) shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the
examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if any, of the person
or persons who will perform the examination. The motion shall be accompanied by
a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.”  (Civ. Proc., §
2032.310, subds. (a)-(b).)  
 
“The court
shall grant a motion for a physical or mental examination under Section
2032.310 only for good cause shown.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.320, subd.
(a); see also Sporich v. Superior Court (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 422, 427
[“the good cause which must be shown should be such that will satisfy an
impartial tribunal that the request may be granted without abuse of the
inherent rights of the adversary”].) A showing of good cause generally requires
“that the party produce specific facts justifying discovery and that the
inquiry be relevant to the subject matter of the action or reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Vinson v.
Superior Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833, 840.)  And “[a] party who chooses
to allege that he has mental and emotional difficulties can hardly deny his
mental state is in controversy.”  (Id. at p.
839.)   
 
The examination
will be limited to whatever condition is “in controversy” in the action.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc. §2032.020(a).)¿ This means the examination must be directly related
to the specific injury or condition that is the subject of the litigation.¿ (Roberts
v. Superior Court (1973) 9 Cal.3d 330, 337.)¿ Often, a party's pleadings
put his or her mental or physical condition in controversy ... as when a
plaintiff claims continuing mental or physical injury resulting from
defendant's acts: “A party who chooses to allege that he has mental and
emotional difficulties can hardly deny his mental state is in controversy.”¿
(See Vinson v. Superior Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833, 837, wherein the plaintiff
claimed ongoing emotional distress from sexual harassment by former employer.)¿
Discovery responses can also frame the issues regarding the injuries and
damages alleged.¿¿ 
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
The Declaration of Tuan Ho, Plaintiff’s counsel, states that he
attempted to meet and confer with Defendant’s counsel by sending an email on
November 16, 2023. (Ho Decl. ¶ 3.) On January 9, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel
requested that Defendant submit for an examination to take the blood sample and
Defendant refused to meet and confer further. (Id. ¶ 5.) Therefore, the
meet and confer requirement is met. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
             Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant infected her with the herpes simplex virus type 2
(“HSV-2”) after a sexual encounter on July 27, 2020. Plaintiff argues that
Defendant refuses to submit to a blood test for this virus. Defendant has
already provided two blood test reports from April 15, 2023 and December 22,
2023. However, Plaintiff contends the reports do not authenticate that
Defendant provided the blood. (Motion, 5.) Plaintiff would like an authorized
representative to be present at the examination to verify Defendant’s identity
with a government-issued identification card. (Motion, 7.) 
 
            In opposition, Defendant asserts
that on April 17, 2024, after this motion was filed, he agreed to the physical
examination and Plaintiff’s terms, as long as his deposition was continued to
after the examination. (Eghbali Decl. ¶ 14, Exh. F.) Defendant maintains the
test results will prove he is not liable. On May 7, 2024, Defendant provided
availability for the first week of June 2024 in order to complete the
examination. (Id. ¶ 18.) Defendant asserts that Plaintiff has not yet
selected a date for the examination. (Id. ¶ 22.) 
 
            In reply, Plaintiff acknowledges
that Defendant verbally agreed to the examination on April 17, 2024. 
 
            Here, while Plaintiff provides the
location where the examination will take place, she does not state the date and
time. Therefore, the procedural requirement is not met. In light of this, and
the fact Defendant has agreed to the examination and has provided available dates,
the motion is denied. 
 
Defendant
requests sanctions in his opposition, under Code of Civil Procedure section
128.7.  However, because Defendant has
not filed this request as a separate motion, or followed the procedural
requirements, the request for sanctions is denied. (See Code Civ. Proc. §
128.7(c).) 
 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel the Physical Examination of Defendant is DENIED.
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s order and file a proof
of service of such.
