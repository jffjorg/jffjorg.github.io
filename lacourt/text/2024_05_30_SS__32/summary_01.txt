And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the motions to relieve counsel, Nathan S. Miller, from his representation of Alexander Ramirez and Esmeralda Espinoza. Counsel has filed a motion to be relieved due to diminished attorney-client communication, stating that he has not received any communication from his clients in over a year and a half. The court has found that counsel has not provided the correct information in court documents, including his own name, and has failed to provide notice of his withdrawal to the clients. The court has denied the motion and ordered counsel to provide notice of the court's ruling and file proofs of service of such.
