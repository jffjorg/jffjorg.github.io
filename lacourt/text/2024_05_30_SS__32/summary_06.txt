(the plaintiff) and Jeremey Ellis regarding intentional misrepresentation and negligence regarding the sexual transmission of a disease. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant infected her with herpes simplex virus type 2. The court has reviewed the pleadings and evidence, and has concluded that the motion is denied.

The court notes that the parties have agreed to the physical examination, but the plaintiff has not provided a specific date and time for the examination. The court also finds that the defendant has not filed a separate motion for sanctions, and therefore, the request for sanctions is denied.

In conclusion, the court denies the plaintiff's motion to compel the physical examination of the defendant, and orders the plaintiff to provide notice of the court's order and file proof of service of such.
