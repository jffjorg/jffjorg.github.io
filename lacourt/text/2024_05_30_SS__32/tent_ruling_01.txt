BACKGROUND
 
            Plaintiffs
Alexander Ramirez and Esmeralda Espinoza (Plaintiffs) counsel of record, Nathan S. Miller (Counsel), moves to be
relieved as counsel for Plaintiffs. Counsel contends relief is necessary due to
diminished attorney-client communication. 
 
            No
opposition has been filed for this motion. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
To be granted relief as counsel, counsel must comply with California
Rules of Court (CRC) 3.1362. Even where grounds for termination exist,
attorneys seeking to withdraw must comply with the procedures set forth in
California Rule of Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3.700 and are subject to
discipline for failure to do so. CRPC 3.700(B) lists various grounds for
mandatory withdrawal. 
 
An attorney's right to terminate the attorney-client relationship and
withdraw from a case is not absolute. (See Vann v. Shilleh (1975) 54
Cal.App.3d 192, 197; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.) The
decision whether to grant or deny an application for withdrawal is within the
court's discretion, and it does not abuse that discretion by denying the
application on the ground that the attorney's withdrawal would work injustice
upon a third party. (Hodcarriers, Bldg. and Common Laborers Local Union No.
89 v. Miller (1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 391.)
 
The rules have been liberally construed to protect clients. (Vann
v. Shilleh, supra, 54 Cal.App.3d 192.) An attorney, either with client's
consent or court's approval, may withdraw from a case when withdrawal can be
accomplished without undue prejudice to client's interests; however, an
attorney “shall not withdraw from employment until the member has taken
reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of the
client, including giving due notice to the client, allowing time for employment
of other counsel, complying with rule 3-700(D), and complying with applicable
laws and rules.” (CRPC 3.700(A)(2).) A lawyer violates his or her ethical
mandate by abandoning a client (Pineda v. State Bar (1989) 49 Cal.3d
753, 758 759), or by withdrawing at a critical point and thereby prejudicing
the client’s case. (CRPC 3.700(A)(2); Vann v. Shilleh, supra.)
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            Counsel has filed forms MC-051 and
MC-052 and has lodged with the Court a copy of the proposed order on form
MC-053 as required.  (Cal Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362.)  Counsel states the instant
motion is filed for the following reason: “I have attempted to contact my
clients for almost a year and a half at the address and phone number known to
me. To this date, I still have not received any communication from my clients.
I am filing a motion to be relieved served concurrently herewith.” (MC-052.) 
 
Counsel
served Plaintiffs by mail at their last known address. Counsel asserts the
address is current because the letters it sent have not been returned. (MC-052,
item 3b(1).) The Declaration of Counsel states he has attempted to reach
Plaintiffs through letters and phone calls but has not received any
communication. Therefore, it appears he has been unable to confirm the address
is current. As a result, Counsel must attempt and mark options in item 3b(2) of
MC-052, and not 3b(1).
 
Counsel has
not provided the correct information for all future proceedings in this case. Counsel
also did not provide his name in item 1 of MC-051, as previously noted in the
last motion to be relieved. 
 
Also, in MC-053,
Counsel should mark 3b and 5a. 
 
 
Accordingly, the Court DENIES the motions to relieve
counsel.  
 
Counsel shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file
proofs of service of such.
