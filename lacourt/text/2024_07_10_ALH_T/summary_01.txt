And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion of Plaintiff's Counsel, Shaun J. Bauman, to be relieved as Counsel. The motion was filed on June 11, 2024, along with a supporting declaration and proposed order. There is no opposition on file. The Judge finds that the attorney has complied with the relevant rules and that there is good cause for the withdrawal, as the counsel and the client have irreconcilable differences that have resulted in a significant breakdown in communication and direction of the case. The Judge notes that the trial has not been set, and therefore, no prejudice will result from the counsel's withdrawal.
