  Case Number:  21STCV21202    Hearing Date:   July 10, 2024    Dept:  T Motion:  Motion to be Relieved as CounselMoving Party: Plaintiff’s Counsel, Shaun J. Bauman, Esq.Responding Party: NoneTentative Ruling: Grant On June 7, 2021, Plaintiff Aaron Birt filed a Complaint against Defendant John W. Ennis for an action arising out of a motor vehicle collision resulting in personal injury and property damage.  On June 11, 2024, Plaintiff’s Counsel, Shaun J. Bauman filed the instant motion to be Relieved as Counsel (MC-051), along with a supporting Declaration (MC-052), and Proposed Order (MC-053). There is no opposition on file.   The Court may issue an order allowing an attorney to withdraw from representation, after notice to the client.  (CCP § 284.)  The attorney may withdraw from representation as long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice to the client’s interest—i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in the litigation.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; see California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-700.)  Attorney Shaun J. Bauman, counsel of record for Plaintiff Aaron Birt, seeks to withdraw from representation of Plaintiff. Counsel states that “there has been irreconcilable differences between this office and the Plaintiffs.” (MC-052.) Counsel further states that such irreconcilable differences have given rise to a significant breakdown in the communication and direction of the case, rendering it impossible for Counsel to continue to represent Plaintiff. (MC-052.) Trial has not been set and thus no prejudice will result from Counsel’s withdrawal.  Based on the foregoing, Counsel has complied with CRC 3.1362 and the Court finds there is good cause for Counsel’s withdrawal. Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.
