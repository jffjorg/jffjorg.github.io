This action arises from Plaintiff Kennedy’s vehicle being struck by Defendant Martinez’s vehicle, which then caused Plaintiff’s Kennedy’s vehicle to strike an additional vehicle. (Complaint, ¶ 6.)  On October 12, 2021, Defendant Martinez filed an Answer to the Complaint.  On October 20, 2021, Plaintiffs Hector Calderon and Miguel Calderon filed a Complaint against Defendant Martinez in Hector Calderon, et al. v. Eduardo Martinez, LASC Case No. 21STCV38689 (the “Calderon Action”).  On June 1, 2023, the Court deemed the instant action and the Calderon Action as related, which the instant action being deemed the lead case. (06/01/23 Minute Order.) Both cases were assigned to the Honorable Jill Feeney in Department 30 at Spring Street Courthouse for all purposes. (06/01/23 Minute Order.)  On June 14, 2023, pursuant to stipulation between the parties, the Court signed an order consolidating the instant action and the Calderon Action. (06/14/23 Order.) The instant action was deemed the lead case. (06/14/23 Order.)   On June 22, 2023, a Request for Dismissal was filed in the Calderon Action as to Plaintiff Miguel Calderon and, on June 23, 2023, Plaintiff Miguel Calderon was dismissed from the Complaint in the Calderon Action with prejudice.  On June 29, 2023, the Honorable Lynne M. Hobbs, sitting in Department 30 at Spring Street Courthouse, entered an order consolidating the instant action and the Calderon Action, with the instant action being deemed the lead case. (06/29/23 Minute Order.)  On March 29, 2024, Plaintiff Kennedy filed a Request for Dismissal as to the entire action and all parties with prejudice. On April 3, 2024, the Court dismissed this action pursuant to the Request for Dismissal.  On June 6, 2024, Plaintiff Hector Calderon (“Calderon”) filed and served the instant unopposed Motion to Set Aside Order of Dismissal.  The motion is unopposed. Any opposition to the motion was required to have been filed and served at least nine court days prior to the hearing. (CCP § 1005(b).) MOVING PARTY POSITION Plaintiff Calderon argues that the law and public policy strongly favor the resolution of matters on their merits, and that the dismissal was filed by separate co-counsel for Plaintiff Kennedy should not have been entered as to Plaintiff Calderon.  No opposition was filed.ANALYSIS I. Legal Standard/Applicable Law  “It is well recognized that all courts have inherent supervisory or administrative powers which enable them to carry out their duties, and which exist apart from any statutory authority.” (First State Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 324, 333.)  “The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) “Section 473 permits the trial court to relieve a party . . . from judgment, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (Elston v. City of Turlock (1985) 38 Cal.3d 227, 232-33.) “A motion seeking such relief lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, and the trial court’s discretion will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion.” (Id. at p. 233) “Section 473 is often applied liberally where the party in default moves promptly to seek relief, and the party opposing the motion will not suffer prejudice if relief is granted.” (Ibid.)   “It is well settled that appellate courts have always been and are favorably disposed toward such action upon the part of the trial courts as will permit, rather than prevent, the adjudication of legal controversies upon their merits.” (Benjamin v. Dalmo Mfg. Co. (1948) 31 Cal.2d 523, 525.)  II. Setting Aside the Dismissal  Here, counsel for Plaintiff Calderon, Christoper Mesaros (“Mesaros”), provides a declaration in support of the motion. According to counsel, on March 29, 2024, counsel for Plaintiff Kennedy filed a request for dismissal with the Court. (Mesaros Decl., ¶ 2.) The request for dismissal was for the entire action, which included all parties and all causes of action. (Mesaros Decl., ¶ 2.) Counsel for Plaintiff Kennedy did not and does not represent Plaintiff Calderon. (Mesaros Decl., ¶ 2.) Counsel for Plaintiff Kennedy had no authority to dismiss the action on behalf of Plaintiff Calderon. (Mesaros Decl., ¶ 2.) Mr. Mesaros states that he believes that counsel for Plaintiff Kennedy “simply made a mistake by filing a dismissal on behalf of all [p]arties when the dismissal” should only have been filed as to Plaintiff Kennedy. (Mesaros Decl., ¶ 3.) Plaintiff Calderon’s case has not been resolved and he requests that the order of dismissal be set aside. (Mesaros Decl., ¶ 4.)  The Court finds that the dismissal should be set aside. Counsel for Plaintiff Calderon has attested to the fact that counsel for Plaintiff Kennedy mistakenly dismissed the entire action. Plaintiff Calderon has presented evidence that counsel for Plaintiff Kennedy had no authority to dismiss the action on behalf of Plaintiff Calderon.   As such, the Court finds that the April 3, 2024 order of dismissal should be set aside. RULING  Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff Calderon’s Motion to Set Aside Order of Dismissal is GRANTED.
