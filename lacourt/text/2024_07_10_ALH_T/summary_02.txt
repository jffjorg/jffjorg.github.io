And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Motion to Set Aside Order of Dismissal filed by Plaintiff Hector Calderon. The motion was unopposed and the Judge found that the dismissal was mistakenly filed by counsel for Plaintiff Kennedy, who had no authority to dismiss the action on behalf of Plaintiff Calderon. The Judge cited relevant case law and statutes, including Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), which permits the court to relieve a party from a judgment, dismissal, or other proceeding taken against them through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The Judge concluded that the dismissal should be set aside and the case should be allowed to proceed on its merits.
