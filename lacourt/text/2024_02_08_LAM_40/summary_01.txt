Summary:

The tentative ruling is about a demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant Excel Restoration, Inc. in a lawsuit brought by Plaintiff David Gastello. The lawsuit alleges claims of intentional interference with contract, negligent interference with contract, and intentional infliction of emotional distress against Excel Restoration, Inc. and other defendants.

The demurrer argued that the complaint fails to sufficiently plead the claims against Excel Restoration, Inc. and that the complaint is uncertain and ambiguous. The court disagreed and found that the complaint adequately pleads the claims against Excel Restoration, Inc.

The motion to strike argued that certain allegations in the complaint are irrelevant and improper. The court granted the motion to strike the portion of the prayer for punitive and exemplary damages that referred to the third and seventh causes of action, which are not pleaded against Excel Restoration, Inc.

The court also ruled that the complaint's fifth cause of action for negligent interference with contract is fatally defective and should be sustained without leave to amend.
