[1]Section
1.15
of the lease is discussed above. Section 4.1 of
the Lease provides, “4.1 Permitted Uses. Tenant shall throughout the
Term of this Lease use the Premises solely for the business purposes set forth
in the Summary of Basic Terms. Landlord’s approval of the uses set forth in the
Summary of Basic Terms shall not be deemed to grant to Tenant an exclusive
right to such use in the Project unless such exclusive use is explicitly set
forth in the Summary of Basic Terms.” (Lu Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A, p. 12.) 


[2]It appears that Gateway
inadvertently referred to “Plaintiff” in paragraph 8 instead of Fitness. 


[3]In support of this assertion, Gateway cites to March
16, 2020 and April 10, 2020 orders issued by the Los Angeles County Department
of Public Health, as well as a March 19, 2020 executive order issued by
Governor Newsom and the “Memorandum on Identification of Essential Critical
Infrastructure Workers During Covid-19 Response” that is referenced in the
Governor’s March 19, 2020 order. (Gateway’s RJN, ¶¶ 2-3, Exs. A-D.) 
 


[4]As discussed, it
appears that Gateway inadvertently referred to “Plaintiff” in paragraph 8 of
Mr. Lu’s declaration instead of Fitness.
