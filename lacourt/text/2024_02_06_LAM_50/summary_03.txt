And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court is considering a dispute over the permitted uses of a premises under a lease agreement. The defendant, Gateway, inadvertently referred to the plaintiff, Fitness, as "Plaintiff" in a declaration. The Court is reviewing orders and executive orders issued by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health and the Governor related to the Covid-19 response. The Court is considering the implications of these orders on the permitted uses of the premises and the obligations of the parties under the lease agreement. The Court's tentative ruling will clarify the permitted uses of the premises and the roles of the parties in light of the Covid-19 response.
