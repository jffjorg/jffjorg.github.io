[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:  
 
MOTION TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
Behrouz Shafie, Esq. (“Counsel”) moves to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff
Solomon Goltche. 
While Counsel has provided
sufficient reason for withdrawal, Item 7 of the proposed order incorrectly
indicates that the Status Conference re Completion of MSC is on May 28, 2024,
not May 20, 2024. In addition, the proposed order does not appear to reference
the Informal Discovery Conference set for April 16, 2024 or the Final Status
Conference set for October 4, 2024. 
If Counsel provides the Court with a revised order prior to
the hearing, the Court will grant the motion.¿Counsel is ordered to give notice
of this order.¿
