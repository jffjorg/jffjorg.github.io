And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Counsel, Behrouz Shafie, to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff, Solomon Goltche. While Counsel has provided sufficient reason for withdrawal, the proposed order contains two errors: it incorrectly lists the Status Conference re Completion of MSC as taking place on May 28, 2024, instead of May 20, 2024, and does not mention the Informal Discovery Conference scheduled for April 16, 2024, or the Final Status Conference set for October 4, 2024. If Counsel provides a revised order before the hearing, the Court will grant the motion.
