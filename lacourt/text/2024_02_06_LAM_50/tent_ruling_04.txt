[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:
 
FIRST AMENDED
  VERIFIED PETITION FOR APPROVAL FOR TRANSFER OF STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT PAYMENT
  RIGHTS BY AND BETWEEN S.B., TRANSFEROR, AND BENTZEN FINANCIAL, LLC,
  TRANSFEREE, PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA INSURANCE CODE
  §10134 ET SEQ.
 



 
Background
On November 28, 2023 in this action,
Petitioner Bentzen Financial, LLC (“Petitioner”) filed a Verified Petition for
Approval for Transfer of Structured Settlement Payment Rights by and Between
S.B., Transferor, and Petitioner, Transferee, pursuant to California
Insurance Code section 10134, et seq.
On December 7,
2023, Petitioner filed a First Amended Verified Petition for Approval for
Transfer of Structured Settlement Payment Rights By and Between S.B.,
Transferor, and Petitioner, Transferee, pursuant to California
Insurance Code section 10134, et seq. Petitioner
requests that the Court approve the transfer of certain structured settlement
payment rights by and between Shawn Becerrada
(“Payee”)
and Petitioner pursuant to Insurance Code section 10134,
et seq.
On January 3,
2024, the Court issued a minute order concerning the instant petition, which
provides, inter alia, that “the
First Amended Verified Petition is continued to February 6, 2024 so Petitioner
can file an Amended Declaration and provide the requisite notice.” On January
30, 2024, Petitioner filed a “Supplemental Exhibit ‘H’ to First Amended
Verified Petition for Approval for Transfer of Payment Rights.” 
Discussion

The Court
notes that the January
3, 2024 minute order provides, inter alia, as follows: 
 
“The Court finds that the transaction is fair and
reasonable and in the best interest of Payee. However,
under Insurance Code section 10139.5, subdivision (c)(5), ‘[e]very petition for approval of a transfer of structured
settlement payment rights, except as provided in subdivision (d), shall
include, to the extent known after the transferee has made reasonable inquiry
with the payee, all of the following:…(5) Whether the payee is currently
obligated under any child support or spousal support order, and, if so, the
names, addresses, and telephone numbers of any individual, entity, or agency
that is receiving child or spousal support from the payee under that order or
that has jurisdiction over the order or the payments in question.’ As set forth
above, Payee states that ‘I owe child support that is in the process of being
paid off out of settlement proceeds set aside by my attorney.’ (Becerrada
Decl., ¶ 3.) However, Payee does not specify whether he is currently obligated under
any child support order, and, if so, the names, addresses, and telephone
numbers of any individual, entity, or agency that is receiving child support
from Payee under that order or that has jurisdiction over the order or the
payments in question. (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(5).).” (See January 3, 2024 minute order at pp. 3-4.) 
In his supplemental declaration filed on
January 30, 2024, Payee states that “[a]s part of the settlement of my
underlying legal claim, my attorneys at the Claypool Law Firm paid $173,721.29
of my settlement proceeds directly to the California State Disbursement Unit
for child support payments on my behalf.” (Suppl. Becerrada Decl., ¶ 6.) Payee
states that “[s]ubsequently, I received a statement from the California State
Disbursement Unit dated January 6, 2024, showing my past due support amount as
$4,179.61. I’ve attached the statement from the California State Disbursement
Unit.” (Suppl. Becerrada Decl., ¶ 7.) Payee states that he “will use part of
the proceeds of this transaction to pay all remaining past due child support.”
(Suppl. Becerrada Decl., ¶ 8.) 
In the January 3, 2024 minute order, the
Court also noted as follows:
 
“In addition, the notice of the proposed transfer and the
petition for its authorization shall include, inter alia, ‘[n]otification that any interested party is entitled to support,
oppose, or otherwise respond to the transferee’s petition, either in person or
by counsel, by submitting written comments to the court or by participating in
the hearing,” and ‘[n]otification
of the time and place of the hearing and notification of the manner in which
and the time by which written responses to the petition must be filed, which
may not be less than 15 days after service of the transferee’s notice, in order
to be considered by the court.’ (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subds. (f)(2)(J)-(K).) It does
not appear that such notifications were included in the instant First Amended
Verified Petition.” (January 3, 2024
minute order at p. 4.) 
As set forth
above, the Court’s January 3, 2024 minute order provides that “the First Amended
Verified Petition is continued to February 6, 2024 so Petitioner can file an
Amended Declaration and provide the requisite notice.” (January 3, 2024 minute order at p. 4,
emphasis added.) However, it still does not appear that Petitioner has provided “[n]otification that any interested party is entitled to support,
oppose, or otherwise respond to the transferee’s petition, either in person or
by counsel, by submitting written comments to the court or by participating in
the hearing,” or “notification
of the manner in which and the time by which written responses to the petition
must be filed, which may not be less than 15 days after service of the
transferee’s notice, in order to be considered by the court.” (Ins.
Code, § 10139.5, subds. (f)(2)(J)-(K).)
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the First Amended
Verified Petition is continued to _________________, 2024 so Petitioner can
provide the requisite notice. 
Petitioner is ordered to provide notice of
this order.
