And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's application for a preliminary injunction, preventing the defendants from proceeding with foreclosure on the real property in question. The plaintiff, Chunhua Qi, claims that the power of attorney executed by his wife, Yan Zhong, was forged and that he did not authorize the deed of trust executed on July 8, 2022. The defendants, Fenping Wang and Integrated Lender Services, Inc., argue that the power of attorney was valid and that they relied on it in good faith.

The court finds that the plaintiff has shown a likelihood of prevailing on his claims and that he faces a risk of irreparable harm if the relief sought is not granted. The court also notes that the defendants' reliance on the power of attorney was not in good faith, as they knew or should have known that the document was forged.

The court cites several California statutes and court decisions in support of its ruling, including Code of Civil Procedure section 526, which provides for the issuance of a preliminary injunction when it appears that a party is likely to prevail on the merits of its case and that the relief sought is necessary to prevent irreparable harm. The court also notes that the defendants' reliance on Probate Code section 4303 is misplaced, as that section only insulates parties from liability for relying on a power of attorney in good faith, but does not insulate the instruments themselves from cancellation.

Overall, the court finds that the plaintiff has shown sufficient evidence to support a preliminary injunction, and therefore grants the application.
