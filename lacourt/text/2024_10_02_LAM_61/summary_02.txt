And here is a summary in English text of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has ruled that Defendant Siavash Arani's demurrer to the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Soroush Arani for the dissolution of the LLC is overruled. The Defendant had argued that the Complaint was uncertain because it mentioned but did not attach the company's operating agreement. The Judge found that the absence of the operating agreement is not a sufficient reason to sustain the demurrer, as the Complaint can still be understood and a cause of action can still be stated. The Judge also noted that the requirement of verbatim pleading of contracts only applies to actions based on the contract or its breach, and that this action is not one on a contract, but rather for dissolution of a limited liability company by judicial decree. The Judge therefore ordered the Defendant to serve and file an answer within 20 days of the order.
