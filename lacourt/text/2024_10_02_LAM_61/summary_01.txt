And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Do Lab, Inc.'s motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages from the First Amended Complaint. The judge found that the complaint adequately alleges despicable conduct and a conscious disregard of the rights and safety of others, sufficient to support allegations of malice or oppression. The judge also found that the complaint alleges that the negligent acts leading to the death of Kelly Galloway were directed or ratified by an officer or managing agent of Do Lab, Inc. The judge concluded that the motion was denied because the complaint adequately pleads facts that support the allegations of malice, oppression, or fraud.
