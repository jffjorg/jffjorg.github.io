And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to set aside a default judgment entered against defendant Alan Bunao. The defendant's counsel, Onica Valle Cole, accepted fault for failing to respond to the complaint, which led to the clerk entering a default and the court entering a default judgment. The court finds that the mandatory relief provision of Code of Civil Procedure Section 473(b) applies, as the motion was timely and accompanied by an affidavit of fault from Cole. The court grants the motion and vacates the clerk's default and the court's default judgment. The defendant is authorized to file his answer, which must be filed and served by January 29, 2024. The court will set a date for a case management conference at the hearing on the motion to vacate the default judgment.
