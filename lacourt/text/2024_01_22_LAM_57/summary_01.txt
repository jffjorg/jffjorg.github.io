This tentative ruling by a judge denies a motion filed by the defendants to appoint a discovery referee for the purpose of setting deposition dates, issuing subpoenas, and ruling on objections. The plaintiff opposes this motion. The judge acknowledges that the case is contentious and that there has been a delay in scheduling and conducting depositions, but does not see this as sufficient reason to appoint a discovery referee at this time. The judge notes that the defendants have not requested an informal discovery conference or a motion to compel, which would have helped to resolve the issues. The judge is concerned about the lack of progress in the depositions and is willing to assist the parties in finding a solution, but is denying the motion without prejudice.
