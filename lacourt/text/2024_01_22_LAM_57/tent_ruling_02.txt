 Case Number:  23STCV19817    Hearing Date:   January 22, 2024    Dept:  57 Pending before the Court is the
motion of Defendant Alan Bunao (“Bunao”) under Code of Civil Procedure Section
473(b) to set aside the default judgment that was entered against him and in
favor of Plaintiff 1200 Management LLC (“1200 Management”) on December 19,
2023.  Bunao’s motion is accompanied by
an affidavit submitted by his counsel Onica Valle Cole (“Cole”) that accepts
fault for Bunao’s failure to respond to Plaintiff’s complaint.  That failure led the Clerk to enter default
against Bunao, which was followed by the Court’s entry of the default judgment.  In the Court’s view, the relief that Bunao
seeks is mandated by Section 473(b). 
Accordingly, the Court is granting Bunao’s motion and vacating both the
Clerk’s default and the Court’s default judgment.
 
Section 473(b) contains provisions
affording either discretionary or mandatory relief from default judgments.  (Noceti v. Whorton (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1062,
1065-1066.)    The discretionary provision applies to any
kind of judgment, default or otherwise. 
It states that “[t]he court may,
upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or       his or her
legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or her through his or her        mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.   (Section 473(b), emphasis
added.)  The mandatory provision applies
only to default judgments.  It states that
“the Court shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more
than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied
by attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect, vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk . .
. or (2) resulting default            judgment
. . . entered against his or her client. 
(Id., emphasis added).  (See
Zamora v. Clayborn Contracting Group (2002) 28 Cal.4th 249, 257 [discussing
differing scope of the discretionary and mandatory provisions of Section
473(b)[. 
 
If a Section
473(b) motion is filed within six months of entry of a default judgment and the
attorney’s affidavit demonstrates that the default judgment was entered due to
fault of the attorney, then the Court has no discretion to deny the motion --  the Court must grant the motion.  (Jimenez v Chavez (2023) 97 Cal.App.5th
50, 58); Milton v. Perceptual Development Corp. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th
861, 866-867; Lorenz v. Commercial Acceptance Ins. Co. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th
981, 989.)  Relief is mandatory even if
the affidavit of fault indicates that the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect in failing to file a response on behalf of the defendant to
the plaintiff’s complaint was inexcusable. 
(SJP Limited Partnership v. City of Los Angeles (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th
511, 516-517.)  By contrast, mistake,
inadvertence, surprise or neglect must be excusable in order for discretionary
relief to be afforded under Section 473(b). 
(Huh v. Wang (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 1406, 1419.)  
 
Bunao’s motion
seeks relief under both the discretionary and mandatory provisions of Section
473(b).  As to the mandatory relief it
seeks, the motion was timely: it was filed within six months after entry of the
default judgment.  And the motion is
accompanied by an affidavit of fault that was submitted Cole.  The Cole affidavit states that Bunao
contacted her on September 18, 2023 and reported that he had been served with 1200
Management’s complaint. (Cole Affidavit, ¶ 2.)  Cole admits that “[m]y office should’ve filed
an Answer for [Bunao]  immediately.”  (Id ¶ 3.) 
Cole explains that “[d]ue to the high case load I had at the time and
some issues with staffing, the [timely] filing of [Bunao’s] Answer slipped
through the cracks.” (Id., ¶ 4.) 
 
Because Bunao’s motion was timely
and accompanied by an affidavit from his counsel Cole indicating that the
clerk’s default and ensuing default judgment against Bunao were Cole’s fault,
relief from the default judgment is mandatory under Section 473(b).  The Court has no discretion in the
matter.  It must grant Bunao’s motion.  This is so even though Cole’s failure to file
a timely response to 1200 Management’s complaint on behalf of Bunao due to
Cole’s high case load and staffing issues that caused the need to respond to
the complaint to slip through the cracks was, in the Court’s view inexcusable
and thus would have warranted the denial of discretionary relief under Section
473(b) had mandatory relief been unavailable to Bunao.
 
Citing Graham v. Beers (1994)
30 Cal.App.4th 1656, 1660) [“Graham”], 1200 Management argues that Bunao
does not qualify for mandatory relief under Section 473(b) because Cole’s
affidavit reveals that she made a conscious decision to “back-burner” Bunao’s
response to 1200 Management’s complaint. 
This argument is unavailing.  In Graham,
the trial court dismissed the plaintiff’s action for failure to prosecute the
case.  In dismissing the action, the
trial court observed that plaintiff’s counsel had put the case on the
“backburner” because counsel believed that the case was going to settle.  (Id. at p. 1660.)   The
plaintiff subsequently moved to set aside the dismissal order under the
mandatory relief provision of Section 473(b) based on affidavit of fault for putting
the case on the backburner that was submitted by the plaintiff’s attorney.  The trial court denied the Section 473(b)
motion.  (Ibid.)   The
Court of Appeal affirmed.   It held that the mandatory relief provision of
Section 473(b) does not apply to discretionary dismissals of a plaintiff’s case
for failure to prosecute.  (Id. at
pp. 1658, 1661.)  
 
Graham has no
bearing, however, on the availability of Section 473(b)’s provision for mandatory
relief from default judgments against defendants.  This is borne out in subsequent caselaw that
cites Graham.  For example, citing
Graham, the Court of Appeal in In re Marriage of Hock & Gordon-Hock
(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1430, 1444, admonished that Section 473(b) provides no
relief to a party who “had an opportunity to have his or her day in court,” but
who did not take advantage of the opportunity and thus had his or her case
dismissed.  Put another way, Graham stands
merely for the proposition that the mandatory relief provision of Section 473(b)
“does not apply to circumstances which are not the procedural equivalent of a
default.”  (Ibid., citing Graham.)  Here, we have a default judgment.  1200 Management’s reliance on Graham to
block Bunao from obtaining mandatory relief under Section 473(b) from the
default judgment is misplaced.
 
1200 Management did not expressly
request that the Court exercise its discretion to impose monetary sanctions
against Bunao and/or Cole under Section 473(c) in connection with the relief
from the default judgment that the Court is granting to Bunao under Section
473(b).  Accordingly, the Court is
declining to do so.
 
Bunao attempted to file an answer to
1200 Management’s complaint after the clerk entered default against Bunao.  The Court struck Bunao’s answer as improper:
a party against whom a default was entered cannot file an answer until after
the default is lifted.   Now that the
Court has set aside the Clerk’s default and the default judgment, Bunao is
authorized to file his answer.   The
answer must be filed and served by January 29, 2024.  The Court will set a date for a case
management conference at the hearing on Bunao’s motion to vacate the default
judgment.
