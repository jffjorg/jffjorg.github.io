  Case Number:  21STCV44389    Hearing Date:   August 1, 2024    Dept:  14 #11Case Background
This is an action for violations of the FEHA,
defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Plaintiff alleges
that another employee, Defendant Salman Khan, began making unwelcome sexual
advances on Plaintiff in January 2020. Khan later sexually assaulted Plaintiff.
After reporting the assault, Plaintiff took medical leave. While Plaintiff was
on leave, Plaintiff’s employer transferred her to a different department. Plaintiff’s
employer did no terminate Khan and instead cut Plaintiff’s hours and refused to
compensate her for her work.
On December 6, 2021, Plaintiff Sandra Viera Villela
filed her Complaint against Defendants White Medical Center, Adventist Health
California Medical Group, Inc., Adventist Health Care Network, Inc., Adventist
Health White Memorial, and Salman Khan.
On December 14, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint.
On June 27, 2024, Defendant White Memorial Medical
Center (AHWM) filed this motion to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to
Requests for Production (RPDs).
On July 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition.
On July 16, 2024, the parties stipulated that AHWM
would withdraw its motion as to PRD numbers 34 and 45-49, leaving only 30, 31,
42, and 54, which pertain to Plaintiff’s employment records and sources of
income.
On July 24, 2024, AHWM filed a reply.
Instant Pleading
Defendant White Memorial Medical Center moves to compel
Plaintiff’s further responses to RPD numbers 30, 31, 42, and 54.
Decision
AHWM’s motion is GRANTED. 
The Court awards AHWM sanctions in the amount of $2,060.
Discussion
AHWM seeks to compel
Plaintiff’s further responses to the following:
RPD 30: All DOCUMENTS that
RELATE TO YOUR employment by any employer, other than DEFENDANT, from January
2019 to present.
RPD 31: All DOCUMENTS that
reflect compensation paid to YOU and income that YOU have received, other than
from DEFENDANT and including from self-employment, from September 2019 to
present, including but not limited to W-2 forms and paycheck stubs.
RPD 42: All DOCUMENTS RELATING
TO any and all self-employment between January 2018 to present, including any
and all businesses run by YOU.
RPD 54: All DOCUMENTS that
RELATE TO payments or income received by YOU through PayPal, Venmo, Zelle, or
any other financial application from January 2018 to the present.
To each of these RPDs,
Plaintiff objected that the RPDs are not relevant to this action, sought
privileged information, that the request was cumulative or duplicative, called
for speculation, was overbroad, and constituted premature discovery of expert witness
opinion.
Plaintiff argues that the
deadline to file this motion had already passed because Plaintiff only agreed
to extend the deadline to compel further responses as to RPDs referenced in an
October 2023 meet and confer letter. (Farkas Decl., ¶8.) Plaintiff argues that
she did not agree to extend the deadline to file a motion to compel further as
to RPD number 54 because it was not included in an October 2023 meet and confer
letter. (Id., ¶7.) However, the October 2023 letter does include RPD
number 54. (Wertheimer Decl., Exh. F.) Therefore, the evidence shows Plaintiff
agreed to extend the deadline for AHWM to file this motion.
The parties’ communications
show that although Plaintiff claims she is not seeking lost wages, there is no
stipulation waiving those damages. (Farkas Decl., Exh.3.) Although Plaintiff’s
counsel represents that she produced all responsive documents, AHWM discovered that
Plaintiff worked other jobs at Huntington Park Nursing Center and Huntington
Health Care in 2021 and 2023. Plaintiff did not produce records pertaining to
those jobs. (Wertheimer Decl., ¶¶28-29.)
The above RPDs seek information
about Plaintiff’s employment and income sources. This information is relevant
to Plaintiff’s damages, specifically lost wages. The request does not seek
privileged information or expert witness testimony. The requests are properly
limited to records from about 2018 or 2019 to present. This time period is not
overbroad. The Court finds Plaintiff’s objections are without merit. Because
Plaintiff failed to produce all responsive documents, AHWM’s motion is GRANTED.
AHWM’s request for $6,650 in sanctions
is excessive. The Court will award AHWM a total of $2,060 in sanctions for four
hours of attorney time at a rate of $500 an hour and filing fees.
