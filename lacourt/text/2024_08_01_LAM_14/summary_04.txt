Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel arbitration filed by the defendants, Lowe's Home Centers, LLC and Lowe's Companies, Inc. The plaintiff, Angel Garcia, alleged that he was denied a full-time position and suffered harassment due to his race while employed by Lowe's as a lumber salesman. He was later wrongfully terminated after suffering an injury on the job.

The defendants argued that the plaintiff electronically signed an arbitration agreement when he began his employment, which requires disputes to be settled by binding arbitration. The judge found that the arbitration agreement was a clickwrap agreement because the plaintiff was required to scroll through the entire agreement before signing. The judge also found that the sentence next to the box accepting the agreement put a reasonably prudent person on notice that clicking the box and submitting the form communicated assent to the Terms of Use.

Since the defendants met their burden of showing an enforceable arbitration agreement exists between the plaintiff and the defendants, and that the scope of the agreement covers the plaintiff's claims, the judge granted the motion to compel arbitration. The case will be stayed pending the outcome of arbitration.
