Significant Statements:
  - The parol evidence rule generally prohibits the introduction of any extrinsic evidence, whether oral or written, to vary, alter, or add to the terms of an integrated written instrument.
  - An integrated agreement is a writing or writings constituting a final expression of one or more terms of an agreement.
  - The test for admissibility of extrinsic evidence to explain the meaning of a written instrument is not whether it appears to be plain and unambiguous on its face, but whether the offered evidence is relevant to prove a meaning to which the language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible.

Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by Akopyan is sustained as to the cause of action for an accounting and overruled as to the remaining causes of action. The Judge finds that the parol evidence rule does not bar Plaintiffs from asserting causes of action based on alleged misrepresentations by Akopyan and Belzunce. The Judge also finds that the Complaint sufficiently alleges a breach of the representations and warranties by Akopyan. The Judge concludes that the demurrer is overruled as to the causes of action for fraud and breach of contract, and sustained as to the cause of action for an accounting.
