The Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The City of Los Angeles and four other defendants (Henry James Williams, Glenn Barry, Zebbra Corbin, and Ana Romero) have moved to quash two notices to appear and produce documents issued by the plaintiff, Shams. The first notice pertains to 54 witnesses who are not managers, directors, or officers of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP). The defendants argue that these witnesses must be subpoenaed, as a notice to appear is insufficient. The Judge grants the motion to quash.

The second notice pertains to seven witnesses who are considered "apex witnesses" because they have no personal or superior knowledge of the facts underlying the case. The defendants argue that these witnesses should not provide testimony. The Judge finds that the necessary showing has been made that these individuals are top government employees for whom the "apex rule" is applicable. The Judge grants the motion to quash for these witnesses.

However, the Judge notes that Renette Anderson, one of the apex witnesses, has unique knowledge of the case and may provide relevant testimony. The Judge denies the motion to quash for Anderson.

The Judge concludes that the plaintiff has failed to carry its burden and grants the motions to quash. The moving party is required to give notice.
