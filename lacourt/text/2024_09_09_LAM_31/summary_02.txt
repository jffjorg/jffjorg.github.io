```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is not ruling on certain objections because they are not relevant to the case. The plaintiff alleges that they filed complaints in 1998, 2005, and 2007, and that an event occurred on November 1, 2017, but later disputes that the event occurred in 2018 instead. The defendant provides an explanation for their actions, which the judge finds to be legitimate and non-retaliatory. The plaintiff does not dispute the defendant's explanation with regard to the protected classes of national origin, race, age, and sexual orientation, effectively conceding that these classes are not the basis of their claim.
