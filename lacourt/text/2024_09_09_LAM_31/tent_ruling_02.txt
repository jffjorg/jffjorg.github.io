[1]
The court need not rule on the following objections as they are not material to
the disposition of the motion: 27, 36, 37, 40, 41.  


[2] The court also notes that
Plaintiff alleges having filed EEOS complaints in 1998, 2005, and 2007.  (See FAC, ¶¶ 9, 12, 14.)


[3] The FAC identifies the date as
November 1, 2017, but Plaintiff states that this event occurred in 2018.  (See Plaintiff’s Additional Material Facts
(AMF) 15.) 


[4] No date or time period is
identified.  The court presumes this
event occurred sometime in 2018 or 2019.


[5] Gabe Doyle’s position is
unspecified. 


[6] The opposition is silent on the
protected classes of national origin, race, age, and sexual orientation.  Plaintiff therefore concedes these classes do
not form the basis of her claim.


[7] Moreover, for the same reasons discussed above
Defendant presents a legitimate, non-retaliatory explanation for the actions.
