Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The Court has denied the Plaintiff's request for a trial schedule and also denied the request to set a case management conference. The Court has set a status conference for February 14, 2024, to discuss the procedural posture of the case. The Court has also observed that a motion for judgment on the pleadings is proper after a defendant has filed an answer to the complaint, but it does not rule on the issue here. The Court notes that the Defendant has not yet filed an answer to the First Amended Complaint and may need to address the current procedural status of the case before moving forward.
