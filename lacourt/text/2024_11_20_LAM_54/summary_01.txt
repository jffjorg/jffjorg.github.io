And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to a complaint and a motion to strike. The plaintiff, Kellee Murayama, alleges that the defendants, Yoon Young Lee and Jun Kyoung Lee, allowed a tenant to hoard dead and live cats, causing her tenant to move out of the building. The defendants demurred to the complaint, arguing that it does not state a cause of action for negligence, and moved to strike the prayer for punitive damages, arguing that the complaint does not allege malice, oppression, or fraud.

The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of action for negligence. However, the judge has granted the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages, finding that the complaint does not allege the necessary facts to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge has also ordered the parties to notice any intent to submit on the tentative ruling by emailing the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
