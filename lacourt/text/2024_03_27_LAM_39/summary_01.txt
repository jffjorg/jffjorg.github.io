And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: one to lift the stay of discovery for limited purposes and another to seal documents. The plaintiff, Berry Gordy, seeks to lift the stay of discovery to take depositions of the defendants and gather information to oppose their anti-SLAPP motions. The defendants, on the other hand, seek to seal documents containing proprietary information.

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to seal the documents, finding that there is an overriding interest in sealing the documents to protect the defendants' proprietary information. The judge has also continued the hearing on the motion to lift the stay of discovery to June 10, 2024, and has ordered the defendants' counsel to provide notice and file proof of the sealing with the court.

The judge has not yet made a final ruling on the motion to lift the stay of discovery, but has indicated that it will grant the motion if the defendants' anti-SLAPP motions are denied or if the requested discovery may result in a different outcome.
