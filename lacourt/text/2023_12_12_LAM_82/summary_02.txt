```

Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to appoint a temporary receiver to manage the assets of the defendants. The Judge finds that there is insufficient evidence to show that the assets are in danger of dissipation, and that the proposed receiver would not be able to make the bitcoin miners operational or safeguard the assets. The Judge notes that the defendants have allegedly breached their agreements with GC Data Centers, but that this does not necessarily mean that the assets are at risk of dissipation. The Judge also finds that the plaintiffs have not proposed a plan that demonstrates the necessity of appointing a receiver.
