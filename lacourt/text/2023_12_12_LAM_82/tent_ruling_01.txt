Case:               Mariaelena Rodriguez Estrada
v. County of Los Angeles et al. (23STCP02632)
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Petitioner Mariaelena Rodriguez Estrada’s Petition for Leave
to File Action Against the City of Los Angeles is DENIED. 
 
On June 7, 2022, petitioner was allegedly injured due to
falling on an uneven and cracked sidewalk in the City of Los Angeles (“City”) (Cho
Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. A.) A claim relating to a cause
of action for personal injury must be presented to the public entity no later
than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.¿ (Gov. Code § 911.2;
Munoz v. State of California¿(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1767, 1776.)¿Accordingly, petitioner had until December 7, 2022 to present a claim
to respondent City. 
 
Petitioner did not file a claim with the City until January
13, 2023. (Cho Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. B.) On January 26, 2023, the City notified
petitioner that no action was taken on the claim because it was untimely
presented. (Cho Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. C.) 
 
Petitioner submitted a written application – dated March 14,
2023 – to respondent for leave to present a late claim. (CCP §§ 911.4, 911.6; Cho
Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. C.) The claim was denied on April 18, 2023. (Cho Decl. ¶ 7
& Ex. D.) Petitioner files this petition seeking relief under Government
Code § 946.6 to present a late claim. The instant petition was
filed on July 25, 2023, within six months of April 18, 2023, pursuant to
Government Code § 946.6(b).
 
To obtain relief, petitioner must demonstrate the failure to
present a claim under Government Code § 945.4 was “through mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect….” (Gov. Code § 946.6(c)(1).)
“The mere recital of mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect is
not sufficient to warrant relief…. There must be more than the mere failure to
discover a fact; the party seeking relief must establish the failure to
discover the fact in the exercise of reasonable diligence.” (Department of
Water & Power v. Superior Court (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1288, 1293.) “The
party seeking relief based on a claim of mistake must establish he was diligent
in investigating and pursuing the claim [citation] and must establish the
necessary elements justifying relief by the preponderance of the evidence.” (Id.)
 
In support of petitioner’s application for leave to present
a late claim, petitioner’s counsel made the following averments: (1) petitioner
had been “unresponsive” with her counsel for an “extensive period of time,”
thereby “making it difficult to determine whether or now [she] wanted to pursue
this personal injury claim”; (2) an “attorney switch” occurred around the
six-month deadline, and the new attorney “was not able to contact [petitioner]
until after the statute had elapsed”; and (3) petitioner does not speak
English, and counsel had to contact petitioner’s son, which delayed the
obtaining of necessary information to file a claim with the City of Los
Angeles. (Cho Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. C at ¶¶ 1-3.) 

 
The foregoing averments do not demonstrate reasonable
diligence. 
 
With respect to the first ground, neither petitioner nor her
counsel provided any reasons why petitioner did not respond to counsel’s
communications. Consequently, it is just as likely, if not more so, on this
showing that petitioner’s delay in presenting a claim after the six-month
period under Government Code § 911.2 had expired was entirely unreasonable.
 
With respect to the second ground, “a late claimant who
seeks relief under section 946.6 may be barred by inexcusable delay by
counsel.” (Hasty v. County of Los Angeles (1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 623, 626,
citing Black v. County of Los Angeles (1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 670, 674-77.)
Even if the attorney handling the instant matter changed “around the six-month
deadline,” there is still no explanation of the prior handling attorney’s
efforts, if any, to present the claim within the six-month period provided by
Government Code § 911.2. Further, if the prior handling attorney was attempting
to ascertain whether petitioner wanted to pursue a claim against the City
during that time period (Cho Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. C at ¶ 1), petitioner has
provided no explanation for why she did not respond to counsel’s
communications, as noted above. 
 
With respect to the third ground, even if counsel needed to
contact petitioner’s son to prepare the claim, counsel did not provide any
declaration indicating their attempts to contact the son prior to the
expiration of the six-month period to present the claim, or any other efforts
made to procure the relevant information from petitioner due to language
barriers. Accordingly, petitioner has not demonstrated why any delay in
obtaining information from petitioner’s son was reasonable. 
 
In sum, petitioner fails to explain sufficiently why petitioner
or counsel delayed in presenting petitioner’s claim until after the
presentation period set forth in Government Code §
911.2. Petitioner consequently does not demonstrate the diligence
necessary to obtain relief under Government Code § 946.6. While there is a
“general policy favoring trial on the merits,” it “cannot be applied
indiscriminately so as to render ineffective the statutory time limits.” (Department
of Water, 82 Cal.App.4th at 1293.)
 
The petition is DENIED.
