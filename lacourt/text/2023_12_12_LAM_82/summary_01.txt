And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the petition for leave to file a late claim by Mariaelena Rodriguez Estrada against the City of Los Angeles. The petitioner was injured on June 7, 2022, and the claim must be presented within six months of the accrual of the cause of action. The petitioner did not present the claim until January 13, 2023, and the City denied the claim on January 26, 2023. The petitioner then filed a petition seeking relief under Government Code § 946.6 to present a late claim. However, the judge found that the petitioner failed to demonstrate reasonable diligence and that the delay in presenting the claim was unreasonable. The judge concluded that the petition is denied.
