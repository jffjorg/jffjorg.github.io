```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted Sahin Kilci's motion for relief to file a motion to tax costs. Kilci's counsel, Ronald Zurek, represents that the court had previously rejected the motion to tax costs due to an error in the filing, and that Kilci's office was not notified of the rejection. The court has discretion to grant relief for "inadvertence" or "excusable neglect" to consider late-filed motions to strike and/or tax costs. The court finds that Kilci has made such a showing via the declarations presented, and therefore grants the motion to file the motion to tax costs.
