```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted Sahin Kilci's motion for relief to file a motion to tax costs. Kilci's counsel, Ronald Zurek, represents that the court had previously rejected the motion to tax costs due to an error in the filing, and that Kilci's office was not notified of the rejection. The court has discretion to grant relief for "inadvertence" or "excusable neglect" to consider late-filed motions to strike and/or tax costs. The court finds that Kilci has made such a showing via the declarations presented, and therefore grants the motion to file the motion to tax costs.

## English Summary

The judge has granted Sahin Kilci's request to file a late Motion to Tax Costs. 

Kilci's attorney explains that the motion was correctly filed on May 5, 2023, but the court's e-filing service rejected it because it was incorrectly categorized. The e-filing service also failed to notify the attorney of the rejection.  The judge found this to be "inadvertence" or "excusable neglect" and granted Kilci's request for relief.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Sahin Kilci's motion for relief to file a motion to tax costs. Kilci, the trustee of Aneeta Sagar's trust, had attempted to file a motion to tax costs on May 5, 2023, but it was rejected by the court due to an incorrect document type. Kilci's attorney, Ronald Zurek, declared that the motion was fully completed and served on the plaintiff's counsel, but was not filed due to the error. The court has determined that Kilci has shown excusable neglect and has granted the motion for relief, allowing Kilci to file the motion to tax costs. The court's decision is based on the Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b), which allows for relief from a judgment or order due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The case involves a motor vehicle collision that occurred on March 15, 2015, and has been ongoing for several years, with various motions and complaints filed by the parties.
