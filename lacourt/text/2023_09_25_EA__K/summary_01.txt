And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted Sahin Kilci's motion for relief to file a motion to tax costs. Kilci's counsel, Ronald Zurek, represents that the court had previously rejected the motion to tax costs due to an error in the filing, and that Kilci's office was not notified of the rejection. The court has discretion to grant relief for "inadvertence" or "excusable neglect" to consider late-filed motions to strike and/or tax costs. The court finds that Kilci has made such a showing via the declarations presented, and therefore grants the motion to file the motion to tax costs.

## English Summary

The judge has granted Sahin Kilci's request to file a late Motion to Tax Costs. 

Kilci's attorney explains that the motion was correctly filed on May 5, 2023, but the court's e-filing service rejected it because it was incorrectly categorized. The e-filing service also failed to notify the attorney of the rejection.  The judge found this to be "inadvertence" or "excusable neglect" and granted Kilci's request for relief.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Sahin Kilci's motion for relief to file a motion to tax costs. Kilci, the trustee of Aneeta Sagar's trust, had attempted to file a motion to tax costs on May 5, 2023, but it was rejected by the court due to an incorrect document type. Kilci's attorney, Ronald Zurek, declared that the motion was fully completed and served on the plaintiff's counsel, but was not filed due to the error. The court has determined that Kilci has shown excusable neglect and has granted the motion for relief, allowing Kilci to file the motion to tax costs. The court's decision is based on the Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b), which allows for relief from a judgment or order due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The case involves a motor vehicle collision that occurred on March 15, 2015, and has been ongoing for several years, with various motions and complaints filed by the parties.

## Tentative Ruling Summary - Case Number: BC592047

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiffs:** Kathleen Coleman ("Coleman") and John Hutton ("Hutton")
* **Defendant:** Sahin Kilci, Trustee of the First Amended and Restated Revocable Living Trust of Aneeta Sagar, Dated June 29, 2020 ("Kilci")

**Background:**

*  Coleman and Hutton sued Aneeta Sagar ("Sagar") and others for injuries sustained in a car accident on March 15, 2015.
* Sagar died on January 17, 2021. Kilci was substituted as the defendant in place of Doe 1.

* A Judgment on Special Verdict was filed on April 10, 2023. 
* Coleman filed a Memorandum of Costs on April 28, 2023.

**Issue:**

* Kilci's motion for relief to file a Motion to Tax Costs.

**Legal Standard:**

* Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b) allows a court to relieve a party from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against them due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.

**Discussion:**

* Kilci's counsel states that they filed a Motion to Tax Costs on May 5, 2023, but it was rejected by the court on May 9, 2023, because it was filed as a "Notice of Motion" instead of a "Motion to Tax."
* Kilci's counsel claims they were not notified of the rejection and only learned of it on June 27, 2023, when contacted by Coleman's counsel.

**Ruling:**

* The court grants Kilci's motion for relief to file a Motion to Tax Costs, finding that Kilci's failure to file the motion correctly was due to "inadvertence" or "excusable neglect."


**English Summary:**

The judge ruled in favor of Sahin Kilci and granted his request to file a Motion to Tax Costs.  Kilci's attorney explained that they accidentally filed the motion under the wrong document type, and the court did not inform them of the error. The judge determined that this was an excusable mistake and allowed Kilci to file the motion.

### English Text Summary
The judge has granted Sahin Kilci's motion for relief to file a Motion to Tax Costs. Kilci is the Trustee of the First Amended and Restated Revocable Living Trust of Aneeta Sagar, who died on January 17, 2021. The case involves a motor vehicle collision that occurred on March 15, 2015, and the plaintiffs, Kathleen Coleman and John Hutton, filed a First Amended Complaint against Sagar, Kinder Clinic, Inc., and others. The court has determined that Kilci has made a sufficient showing of "inadvertence" or "excusable neglect" to grant relief under Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b). The Motion to Tax Costs was prepared and served on May 5, 2023, but was rejected by the court on May 9, 2023, due to an error by First Legal, the eFiling service. Kilci's attorney was not notified of the rejection until June 27, 2023. The court has granted Kilci's motion, allowing him to file the Motion to Tax Costs.
