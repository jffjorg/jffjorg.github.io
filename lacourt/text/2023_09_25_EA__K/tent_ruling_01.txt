Legal Standard

“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party
or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other
proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall
be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken. . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b) [Emphasis added].)
Discussion
Kilci moves the court for an order, per Code of Civil
Procedure § 473(b), for relief to file his Motion to Tax Costs.
The motion is granted. Kilci’s counsel Ronald Zurek
(“Zurek”) represents that judgment was entered on April 10, 2023 (Zurek Decl.,
¶ 2), that Plaintiff filed a memorandum of costs on April 28, 2023 such that a
motion to tax needed to be filed by May 15, 2023 (Id., ¶¶ 3 and 4), that
on May 5, 2023, the aforesaid motion was “fully done and completed,” served on
Plaintiff’s counsel and reserved for hearing on July 3, 2023 (Id., ¶¶
4-5, Exhs. A & B), that the motion was given to First Legal for filing (Id.,
¶¶ 6-7, Exhs. C & D), that on June 27, 2023, he received an email from
Plaintiff’s counsel advising him that the motion was not on the court’s
calendar (Id., ¶ 8) and that upon receipt of this email, his office
contacted First Legal and learned that the motion had been rejected by the
court for filing on May 9, 2023 (apparently on the basis that First Legal had
filed the motion not as a “Motion to Tax” but as a “Notice of Motion”) but they
failed to notify his office of same (Id., ¶ 8, Exh. E).
Kilci has also provided a declaration from First Legal
eFiling manager Aleix McNichols (“McNichols”). (Zurek Decl., ¶ 10, Exh. F.)
McNichols confirms that First Legal submitted the motion to tax to the court
via the eFiling portal on May 5, 2023 (McNichols Decl., ¶ 4), that on May 9,
2023, the court rejected the filing because the eFiling Specialist from First
Legal submitted the document as a “Notice of Motion” document type (Id.,
¶ 5), that the rejection information was not relayed to Kilci’s attorney’s
office due to oversight on First Legal’s end (Id.) and that on June 27,
2023, it was identified that the Kilci’s attorney’s office had not been made
aware of the rejection and Kilci’s attorney’s office was then advised that the
document had been rejected. (Id., ¶ 6).
The court has discretion to grant Code of Civil Procedure §
473(b) relief for “inadvertence” or “excusable neglect” to consider late-filed
motions to strike and/or tax costs. (Wegner, Fairbank & Epstein, CAL. PRAC.
GUIDE: CIV. TRIALS & EV. (The Rutter Group 2022) ¶ 17:525; see also Douglas
v. Willis (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 287, 290). The court determines that Kilci
has made such a showing via the above declarations.
