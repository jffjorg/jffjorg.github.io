And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay the action is granted. The defendants, Ascend Ecom LLC, Will Bast, and Jeremy Leung, argue that the arbitration agreement in the Management Agreements between Ascend and the plaintiffs is binding on the parties. The plaintiffs oppose the motion, arguing that the action should not be compelled to arbitration because neither defendant Basta nor Leung have agreed to arbitrate this dispute. The court finds that the plaintiffs' argument is without merit because this motion was brought by defendants Basta and Leung with Ascend, and there is no evidence that Basta and Leung oppose the motion. The court also finds that the Management Agreements are governed by Wyoming state law, which does not contain an equivalent provision to CCP ยง 1281.2(c). Therefore, the court grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay the action. The court sets an OSC Re: Status of Arbitration for February 20, 2025, at 8:30 a.m., and orders the defendants to give notice.
