And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jane Dhillon versus 8715 Burton Tower, Inc. and A-Ju Realty, Inc. The defendants have filed two motions to compel the plaintiff's experts, Dr. Shakil Saghir and Dr. Ronald Simons, to appear for deposition. The plaintiff has opposed the motions, arguing that they are premature and that the defendants have not made sufficient efforts to meet and confer.

The Court has ruled in favor of the defendants, granting their motions to compel the depositions. The Court has ordered Dr. Saghir to appear for deposition on September 16, 2024 at 10am and Dr. Simons to appear for deposition on September 16, 2024 at 2pm. The deponents are also ordered to produce all documents requested in the deposition notices.

The Court has denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that the parties have acted with substantial justification. The ruling is intended to ensure timely discovery and to allow the defendants to take the depositions of the plaintiff's experts.
