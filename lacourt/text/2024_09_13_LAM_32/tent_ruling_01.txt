  et al.,

  Case No.:  22STCV27008
  Hearing Date:  September 13, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendants’ motions to compel
  plaintiff’s experts to appear for deposition 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On August 19, 2022, Plaintiff Jane
Dhillon filed this action against Defendants 8715 Burton Tower, Inc. and A-Ju
Realty, Inc., asserting causes of action for (1) negligence, (2) breach of
contract, (3) breach of the implied warranty of habitability, (4) constructive
eviction, and (5) violation of L.A. Municipal Code section 45.33. 
            On August 16, 2024, Defendants filed
the instant two motions to compel Plaintiff’s experts, Drs. Shakil Saghir and
Ronald Simons, to appear for deposition. Plaintiff filed her oppositions on
August 30, 2024. Defendants filed their reply on September 6, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
“On receipt of an expert witness list from
a party, any other party may take the deposition of any person on the list.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.410.) “If, after service of a deposition notice, a
party to the action . . . without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination . . . or to produce for
inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing
described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an
order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production
for inspection of any document … described in the deposition notice.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450(a).) 
DISCUSSION
I.
Factual Background
On May 6, 2024, Plaintiff served her
Expert Witness Designation, designating Drs. Saghir and Simon as experts to
testify on the causation of Plaintiff’s injuries. (Kirschen Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. A.)
On May 13, 2024, Defendants served a Notice of Taking Expert Deposition on
Plaintiff, scheduling the depositions of Drs. Saghir and Simons for May 28,
2024. (Id., ¶ 5, Ex. B.) Because Plaintiff failed to produce all of the
documents requested in the deposition notice, the deposition could not proceed
on the scheduled date. (Id., ¶ 6.) After Plaintiff did not agree to
produce the experts for deposition prior to the original trial date of June 11,
2024, the trial was continued to October 15, 2024. (Ibid.)
On July 1, 2024, Defendants served a
second Notice of Taking Expert Deposition, scheduling the depositions of Drs.
Saghir and Simons for July 24, 2024. (Kirschen Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. D.) On July 19,
2024, Plaintiff notified Defendants that the depositions could not occur on
July 24, 2024 due to the recent withdrawal of her counsel. (Id., Ex. E.)
Plaintiff requested a continuance of the depositions and the trial. (Ibid.)
Defendants initially refused to continue the depositions, but after Plaintiff
reiterated that she was attempting to seek new counsel and had not yet received
her case file from her prior attorney, Defendants asked Plaintiff to provide
alternative dates by July 23, 2024. (Ibid.) On July 23, 2024, Plaintiff
responded that she was still attempting to acquire new counsel and her case
file, and proposed a deposition date of November 24, 2024 and a continued trial
date of February 15, 2025. (Ibid.) Defendants responded that this was
unacceptable because the deposition date would be after the current trial date,
and the trial could not be continued any further. (Ibid.) 
Plaintiff’s new counsel substituted in on
August 16, 2024. (Stupak Decl. ¶ 4.) That day, Plaintiff’s counsel wrote to
request a meet and confer to resolve the instant motions. (Id., Ex. 1.)
Plaintiff’s counsel met and conferred with defense counsel on August 22, 2024
via Zoom. (Id., ¶ 5.) On August 28, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel notified
defense counsel that the experts would be available on September 16, 2024. (Id.,
Ex. 2.) 
II.
Premature
            Plaintiff argues that the motions
are premature because the expert designation deadline was extended to August
26, 2024, and the expert discovery cutoff is September 30, 2024. However, an
expert deposition may be taken “[o]n receipt of an expert witness list from a
party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.410.) It is undisputed that Plaintiff served
her expert designations on May 6, 2024. (See Kirschen Decl. ¶ 4, Ex. A.)
Therefore, Defendants were entitled to depose the listed witnesses at any point
afterwards. Plaintiff cites no authority for the proposition that Defendants
must wait until the expert designation deadline or discovery cutoff. Therefore,
the motion is not premature.  
III.
Meet and Confer
            A motion to compel deposition must
be accompanied by a declaration demonstrating an effort to meet and confer.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450(b)(2).) The record above shows that Defendants met
and conferred with Plaintiff after each of the two deposition notices in May
and July 2024. Plaintiff’s new counsel also confirms that Defendants met and
conferred over Zoom after the recent substitution in August 2024. (Stupak Decl.
¶ 5.) Therefore, Defendants have satisfied the meet and confer
requirement.  
IV.
Mootness
            Lastly, Plaintiff argues that the
motions are moot because she has since confirmed that her experts are available
for deposition on September 16, 2024. (See Stupak Decl., Ex. 2.) However, the
deposition notices were first served back in May 2024. After months of delay,
an order compelling the depositions is warranted to ensure timely discovery. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ motions to compel
deposition are GRANTED. Dr. Shakil Saghir is ordered to appear for deposition
on September 16, 2024 at 10am. Dr. Ronald Simons is ordered to appear for
deposition on September 16, 2024 at 2pm. Deponents shall produce all documents
requested in the deposition notices.  
Sanctions are denied as the parties acted
with substantial justification.
