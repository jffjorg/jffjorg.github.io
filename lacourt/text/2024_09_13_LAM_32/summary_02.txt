And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's pseudonym, Jane Doe. The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendants, Lockton Companies LLC - Pacific Series, Timothy Noonan, and Arthur Carlin, alleging discrimination, harassment, retaliation, failure to prevent, and wrongful termination. The defendants argued that the plaintiff's pseudonym should be stricken because it is not necessary to protect her privacy.

The judge found that the plaintiff's claims involve allegations of sexual harassment and unwanted touching, and that the disclosure of her identity poses a significant risk of potential personal and professional stigma. The judge also found that the defendants are aware of the plaintiff's identity and that there is no indication that her anonymity has prevented them from pursuing evidence to defend against her claims. Therefore, the judge denied the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's pseudonym, finding that the plaintiff's interest in privacy outweighs the defendants' interest in knowing the plaintiff's true identity.
