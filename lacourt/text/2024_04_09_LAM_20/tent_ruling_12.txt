On August 19, 2022, Plaintiff Jane Doe filed the operative Complaint against Defendants LAUSD and Does 1-60 for (1) childhood sexual abuse, (2) intentional infliction of emotional distress (“IIED”), (3) negligent hiring, supervision, and retention, (4) failure to report suspected child abuse, (5) negligent supervision of a minor, and (6) negligence.  Plaintiff alleges that when she was a minor attending middle school she was repeatedly sexually abused and molested by her educator and coach, Doe 1.   Defendant LAUSD now seeks relief from its waiver of objections with respect to Plaintiff’s requests for production, set one, and special interrogatories, set one.  Defendant contends that it has now served responses and that its responses were not timely only because of a calendaring error.  Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a) provide that the Court may relieve a party from its waiver of objection when “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with [the Code of Civil Procedure, and] (2) The party's failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.”Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s responses are “replete” with boilerplate and inappropriate objections.  The merit of the objections, however, is not at issue for the Motion.  An objection is a valid response under the Code of Civil Procedure.  If the objections are meritless, motions to compel further responses should be filed only after a legitimate meet and confer effort.   The Court finds that Defendant (1) served compliant discovery responses and (2) the failure to timely serve responses was due to excusable neglect in that counsel miscalendared the deadline to respond to discovery.  Therefore, the Motion is granted.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
