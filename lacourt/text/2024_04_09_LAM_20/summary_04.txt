Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Boris Adjamian v. Tamara Rosenthal, STJ, LP, and Magnifique Congregate Living Inc. Plaintiff Adjamian sought to compel initial responses to his discovery requests and special interrogatories. However, defendants have now filed a declaration stating that responses have been served. The court finds that the motions to compel are therefore denied as moot. Additionally, the court awards reduced sanctions in the amount of $1,000. The court encourages counsel to use LACourtConnect rather than appearing in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
