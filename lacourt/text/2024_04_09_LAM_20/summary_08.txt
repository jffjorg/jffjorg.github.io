And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, finding that there are triable issues of material fact regarding the plaintiff's standing. The plaintiff argued that his COVID-19 bonus should be included in his regular rate of pay, while the defendant argued that it is excludable as a matter of law. The court has ruled that the U.S. Department of Labor's guidance on non-discretionary pay must be included in the regular rate of pay. The court has granted the plaintiff's request for further discovery on the issue of whether the COVID-19 bonus was non-discretionary and thus needed to be included in the regular rate.
