And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The tentative ruling is issued by a judge in a case between Ohlaug, the plaintiff, and Lyft, Inc., the defendant. Ohlaug alleges that his friend used the Lyft app to get a ride, but the driver exited the vehicle and assaulted Ohlaug. Lyft demurred to all causes of action, arguing that Ohlaug did not sufficiently plead duty, breach, and injuries. The court grants Lyft's demurrer with respect to the judicial notice of the complaint.

The court rules that Ohlaug's allegations are sufficient to state a claim for negligence, negligent hiring, supervision, and retention, and vicarious liability. The court finds that Lyft owed a duty to act because it provided transportation services, and that Ohlaug was an intended user of the ride. The court also finds that Lyft did not adequately vet drivers and did not provide anti-harassment or anti-assault policies.

The court denies Lyft's demurrer to the vicarious liability claim, finding that the driver's actions were in the scope of employment. The court also denies Lyft's demurrer to the common carrier claim, finding that Lyft was a common carrier that offered transportation services to the public.

The court grants Lyft's demurrer with respect to the judicial notice of the complaint, allowing Lyft to admit the complaint as a court document for its truth.
