 
Plaintiffs move for an award of attorneys’ fees and costs. The
parties settled this Song-Beverly matter except as to those issues. 
 
This is an
action under the Song-Beverly Act in which Jaime and Phyllis Martinez
(Plaintiffs) alleged defects in a 2013 Ford Escape (Vehicle). Plaintiffs sued
Cerritos Ford, Inc. and Ford Motor Company (Defendant or Ford) for breach of
express and implied warranties. The Vehicle was purchased certified pre-owned
on May 11, 2013 from Cerritos Ford Lincoln and received a 1-year/48,000 mile
basic warranty and a 7-year/100,000 miles powertrain warranty.  Plaintiff Jaime is listed on the Retail
Installment Sale Contract, but Phyllis is the primary driver.
 
Plaintiffs
brought the Vehicle in for repair on at least seven occasions. The first visit
was on February 10, 2014 for a recall relating to the engine cylinder. On
January 9, 2015, the Vehicle began to idle high, and the check engine light
turned on. A month later, Plaintiffs claimed the Vehicle “idles rough when
accelerating from a stop.” On May 1, 2015, the check engine light came on again
and Plaintiffs complained that the Vehicle “did not crank over two days.” On
December 30, 2016, the check engine light came on again and there was coolant
leaking. One year later, Plaintiffs complained of a loud chirping from the
engine and coolant leakage.  Finally, on
February 5, 2018, there was a reported “major fuel leak in engine compartment,”
but Plaintiffs declined the repair. 
 
Plaintiffs argue that, as the
prevailing party, they are entitled to fees and costs under Civil Code section
1794, subdivision (d). They seek lodestar attorneys’ fees of $99,714.00, plus a
1.5 multiplier -- in the amount of $49,857-- and costs of $38,639.05. The total
requested in attorney fees and costs is $188,210.05. 
 
Defendants Ford Motor Company and
Cerritos Ford Lincoln (Ford) filed an opposition arguing the amounts requested
in fees and costs are unreasonable and excessive. 
 
The Court grants the motion for
attorneys’ fees in part. The request for costs is also granted in a slightly
reduced amount. 
 
Legal Standard
 
            A prevailing buyer in an action
under Song-Beverly “shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the
judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including
attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined by the Court to have
been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of such action.”¿¿(Civ. Code, § 1794,¿subd. (d).) 
 
            The
prevailing party has the burden of showing that the requested attorney fees
were “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were
reasonable in amount.” (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California
Inc.¿(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 817.) The party seeking attorney fees “
‘is not necessarily entitled to compensation for the value of attorney services
according to [his] own notion or to the full extent claimed by [him].’ ” (Levy
v. Toyota Motor Sales, USA, Inc.¿(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807,
816.)¿¿Therefore, if the “time expended or the monetary charge being made for
the time expended are not reasonable under all the circumstances, then the
court must take this into account and award attorney fees in a lesser amount.”
(Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America¿(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.)¿¿ 
¿¿ 
            A court may
“reduce a fee award based on its reasonable determination that a routine,
noncomplex case was overstaffed to a degree that significant inefficiencies and
inflated fees resulted.”¿¿(Morris v. Hyundai Motor America¿(2019) 41
Cal.App.5th 24, 39.)¿¿It is also appropriate to reduce an award based on
inefficient or duplicative efforts. (Id.¿at p. 38.) However, the
analysis must be “reasonably specific” and cannot rely on general notions of
fairness. (Kerkeles¿v. City of San Jose¿(2015) 243 Cal.App.4th
88,¿102.)¿¿Moreover, in conducting the analysis, courts are not permitted to
tie any reductions in the fee award to some proportion of the buyer’s damages
recovery. (Warren v. Kia Motors America, Inc.¿(2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24,
39.)
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiffs
seek $99,714.00 in attorneys’ fees for Knight Law Group, LLP (Knight
Law), plus a 1.5 multiplier enhancement, and costs of $38,639.05, for a total $188,210.05.

 
            Defendant
Ford does not dispute that Plaintiffs are the prevailing parties under the
settlement agreement. Instead, Defendant argues the that hours incurred to
litigate this routine, non-complex case that settled before trial is
unreasonable. Defendant Ford argues that fees should be reduced to a total of $49,293.63,
which represents a reasonable number of hours incurred based on the purported
experience level of Plaintiffs’ attorneys and the nature of the litigation.
Defendant Ford also argues the amount requested in costs should be taxed. 
 
            A
calculation of attorneys’ fees for a Song-Beverly action¿begins with the
“lodestar” approach, under which the Court fixes the lodestar¿at¿“the number of
hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.”¿ (Margolin
v. Regional Planning Com.¿(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004-1005.)¿
“California courts have consistently held that a computation of time spent on a
case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of
an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.”¿ (Ibid.)¿ “ ‘The reasonable hourly
rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.’ ”¿ (Id.¿at
p. 1004.)¿ The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of
factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value
for the legal services¿provided.¿ (Serrano v. Priest¿(1977) 20 Cal.3d
25, 49;¿PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler¿(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) 
 
            “[T]rial
courts need not, and indeed should not, become green-eyeshade accountants. The
essential goal in shifting fees (to either party) is to do rough justice, not
to achieve auditing perfection. So trial courts may take into account their
overall sense of a suit, and may use estimates in calculating and allocating an
attorney's time.” (Fox v. Vice (2011) 563 U.S. 826, 838.)
 
Attorneys’ fees
 
Hourly
Rate: 
 
            Defendant Ford
first contends that Plaintiffs’ attorneys’ hourly rates are unreasonable.
 
            In assessing
the reasonableness of hourly billing rates,¿“the court may rely on its own
knowledge and familiarity with the legal market, as well as the experience,
skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees [citation], the
difficulty or complexity of the litigation to which that skill was applied
[citations], and affidavits from other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in
the community and rate determinations in other cases.”¿(569 East County
Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc.¿(2016) 6 Cal.App.5th
426, 437; see¿Mountjoy v. Bank of America, N.A.¿(2016) 245 Cal.App.4th
266, 272 [“ ‘ “a reasonable hourly rate is the product of a multiplicity of
factors…[including] the level of skill necessary, time limitations, the amount
to be obtained in the litigation, the attorney’s reputation, and the undesirability
of the case” ’ ”].)¿
 
            Here,
Defendant Ford argues the rates sought are excessive for these “cookie-cutter
lemon law cases.”
Of note, Defendant Ford points to the hourly rates of non-partner Attorneys
Kamau Edwards and Attorney Brian Plummer, who each billed at a rate of $550,
while somewhat inexplicably, Amy Morse, who is a partner, billed at a lower
rate of $450 per hour. 
            
Further, citing several unpublished
federal cases on lemon law, Defendant Ford argues that the Court should limit
Knight Law’s attorneys’ rates to $225-$275 for associates
and $325- $450 for partners. Specifically, in
Olague v. Ford Motor Company (C.D. Cal., June 29, 2021, No.
518CV02215MCSKKX) 2021 WL 9095731, the federal district court specifically
considered the rates sought by this law firm, Knight Law, and reduced the
hourly rates on the basis that the hourly rates sought seemingly “outpace[d]
the prevailing rate for similar work” (Id. at *3.) The Olague
court cited Arriaga v. Ford Motor Co.,
CV 18-09089 DSF (KSx), Dkt. No. 36, at *4–*7 (C.D. Cal. May 8, 2020), which
adjusted counsels' hourly rates to $325 for partners and $225 for associates
after reviewing the 2018 Real Rate Report: The Industry's Leading
Analysis of Law Firm Rates, Trends, and Practices (Real Rate Report). In Hernandez v. FCA US LLC (C.D. Cal., Jan. 4,
2019, No. CV 17-5452-GW(ASX)) 2019 WL 2932637, which involved a Song-Beverly
Act case, the court relied on the first quartile rates in the 2017 Real Rate Report to determine attorney
hourly rate given the “lack[] [of] any serious complexities.” (Id. at *3.)
 
Here,
Ford includes the 2022 Real Rate Report: The Industry's Leading Analysis of
Law Firm Rates, Trends, and Practices, which states that the Median rate
for Consumer Goods cases for partners was $366 and $281 for associates.
(Biemann Decl., ¿ 4, Ex. E, p. 64.) 
 
            Ford’s cases are well taken. However,
there are also cases that have found rates similar to those sought in this
motion reasonable. (See
e.g, Nai Hung Li
v. FCA US LLC (C.D. Cal., July 1, 2019, No. 2:17-CV-06290-R-JEM)
2019 WL 6317769, at *2; Zargarian v. BMW of North America, LLC (C.D.
Cal. 2020) 442 F.Supp.3d 1216, 1227.)
 
            Additionally,
a review of the Kirnos Declaration in support of the motion for attorney’s fees
– which contains the descriptions of each attorneys’ education and experience –
supports finding Plaintiff’s attorneys’ hourly rates ranging from $200 to $550
were reasonable; the rates are supported by substantial evidence under the
present circumstances. (Kirnos Decl., ¶¶ 34-48.)
 
Based on the Court's review of the
recent Real Rate Report, and the Court's familiarity with the current local
market, and Plaintiff’s evidence of the experience and skills of the various
attorneys – the Court finds that Plaintiff's requested rates per hour are
reasonable.
 
            Number of
Hours Incurred: 
 
            Defendant Ford
also challenges the hours incurred, arguing that the amounts are excessive, duplicative,
and otherwise unreasonable.
 
             Ford’s opposition challenges several specific entries.
The Court will address these in each in turn: 
 
12/15/2021
Entries for Zachary Powell seeking 4.5 hours to “Review and analyze deposition
transcript”: Defendant Ford suggests that these 4.5
hours incurred is unreasonable because “most” of these depositions were less
than an hour long. However, Ford fails to note that these entries pertained to six
different depositions. The Court cannot find that spending 4.5 hours to review
and summarize six different depositions – even ones that may have been less
than hour – is unreasonable. 
 
1/14/2022 -1/15/2022 for Attorney
Matthew Kreymer:
Defendant Ford argues that that it was unreasonable for Attorney Matthew
Kreymer spent a total of 4.3 hours drafting a four-page meet and confer letter
regarding the deposition of Ford’s Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK). In
response, Plaintiffs argue that this letter was necessary because Julie Moore,
Ford’s PMK, was only produced on limited categories and lacked personal
knowledge of the prelitigation repurchase evaluation in this case. Therefore,
it was reasonable for Plaintiffs to review the transcript and create a detailed
meet and confer with Ford about producing an additional PMK witness. Upon
review of the entries underlying this challenge, the Court acknowledges that the
billing entries identify more discrete tasks than simply drafting a single letter
– such as reviewing the deposition transcript at issue. Nonetheless, the amount
of time incurred is still excessive for all the underlying tasks. The fees for
these entries will be reduced by two hours or $590. 
 
Kamau
Edwards also seeks 2.3 hours or $1,035.00 to review and draft a summary of
Plaintiff Phyllis Martinez’s deposition:
This amount is unreasonable to review and summarize a single deposition. The
Court will reduce this amount by 1 hour or $550. 
 
3/21/23
entry for Attorney Deepak Devabose: Plaintiff seeks 2.2 hours for the time
incurred by Attorney Deepak Devabose for traveling to and from the MSC/FSC.[1]
In support of the request to reduce these fees, Defendant Ford suggests travel
time fees are not recoverable as a matter of law. This is not the law:  “[A]ttorney's fees for travel hours may be
awarded if the court determines they were reasonably incurred [citations].” (Roe
v. Halbig (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 286, 312-313.) A reasonableness standard
applies to whether travel time fees can be recovered; under the circumstances
here, it was not unreasonable for Plaintiffs’ counsel  to appear at this hearing in-person. (See Reply
8:15-25.) The request to reduce these hours is denied. 
 
2/15/23
entries of Attorney Brian Plummer: Plaintiffs seek
3.5 hours or $1,925.00 to “review and analyze” Plaintiffs’ first set of discovery
responses. Defendant Ford argues that there is no explanation for why Plaintiffs’
counsel is reviewing discovery responses over two years after these responses
were served. Plaintiff argues that hours were incurred to review evidence to
prepare a trial strategy. The time for such review is excessive.  The Court reduces the amount sought by 2.5
hours or $1,375. 
 
3/8/23
entries of Attorney Brian Plummer: Plaintiffs
request 2.8 hours or $1,540 for the time incurred by Attorney Plummer to review
and analyze Ford’s Motions in Limine. Defendant Ford contends this amount was
already billed previously by Deepak Devabose on March 7, 2023, who drafted the
opposition to the motion in limine. These amounts are duplicative and will be
reduced by 2.8 hours or $1,540. 
 
Fees
incurred on the instant motion: Plaintiffs billed 12.90
hours (or $6,385.50) related to the Plaintiffs’ instant motion for attorney fees,
with 7.0 of those hours being for the reply and hearing. Defendant argues that these
amounts are excess given Knight Law’s use of cookie-cutter templates. (Bieman
Decl., ¶ 3, Exs. B-C [identifying similar fee motions filed by Plaintiffs’
counsel].) The reply submits evidence to support the estimated costs for the
reply sought in the moving papers. (Cutler Reply Decl., ¶¶ 13-16.) The
opposition is well taken. The fee motions are substantially similar to other
fee motions by Knight Law, rendering the amount sought excessive. The fees here
will be reduced by $3,000. 
 
            Additionally, Defendant Ford seeks
to exclude fees that were block billed tasks (18.50 hours or $6,749.50),
internal tasks (15.90 hours or $6,723.00), duplicative tasks (15.70 hours or
$7,121.50), and tasks that are clerical in nature (7.60 or $2,887.00). (Bieman
Decl., Ex. F.)[2]

 
            In reviewing the entries underlying
these requested reductions, these requests are largely well taken. The Court
will reduce the fees requested by Plaintiffs as follows: reducing block billed
tasks by $2,000, internal tasks by $4,500, duplicative tasks by $3,121.50, and
tasks that are clerical in nature by $887.
 
            Multiplier
adjustment
 
            Finally,
Plaintiff seeks a 1.5 lodestar multiplier based on excellent result, the risk
of taking on the case on contingency, and the substantial delay in payment of
attorney fees.  
 
            Relevant
factors to determine whether an enhancement is appropriate include (1) the
novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in
presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded
other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee
award.  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001)
24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)  
 
            Although
this matter was taken on contingency (Kirnos Decl., ¶ 9), none of the other
factors support the application of a multiplier. This was a garden variety
Song-Beverly case; there were no novel or difficult questions presented. (Thayer
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819, 834.) Further,
the¿contingent risks, skill, and difficulty¿Plaintiff’s attorneys¿assert are
absorbed by¿their¿already high (albeit reasonable) hourly rates. (See¿Robertson
v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California. Inc.¿(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th
785, 822.) 
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s request for a lodestar multiplier is denied.
 
            Adjustments
to attorneys’ fees are summarized:

            The Court
grants Plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’ fees in the sum of $82,150.50.
 
Costs: 
 
Defendant Ford challenges Plaintiffs’
claimed costs of $38,639. 
 
First, Ford challenges the service
of process fees as unreasonable and duplicative. The Memorandum of Costs properly
identifies the numerous depositions and civil subpoenas that required service
in this matter. Defendants Ford’s conclusory assertion that service of these
subpoenas was unnecessary is without explanation. Further, as the reply explains
“individuals who happen to work at the dealership were
nonparties, and as such the law requires that each witness be served his own
subpoena.”
(Culter Reply Decl., ¶ 8.) Admittedly, however, there is no explanation for the
four PMK civil subpoenas. As such, costs incurred for these items will be
reduced by $217.35. 
 
Second, Defendant
challenges Plaintiffs’
request for costs in Item 8. Specifically, Plaintiffs
seek costs for in the amount of $175 for witness fees for James Ryan, Rudy
Sanchez, Miguel Gonzalez, Ricardo Cuevas, and Fernando Cervante. Additionally,
Plaintiffs request $13,830.67 in expert witness fees for two experts, Barry
Bookman and Anthony Micale. In opposition, Defendant requests the Court strike both
the entirety of Plaintiffs’ expert witness fees and Plaintiffs’ ordinary
witness fees to not allow any costs for witnesses. In making this argument,
Defendant argues that none of these ordinary witnesses testified at trial. Further,
Defendant Ford argues that the fees for the expert witness have not been
substantiated by any evidence. In reply, Plaintiffs submit the expert witness invoices
to substantiate the costs incurred.[3]
(Cutler Reply Decl., Ex. A.) Also, contrary to Defendant’s opposition argument,
the fees incurred by Anthony Micale are not for $8,000 in a single day but span
fees incurred from 2/13/2023 to 3/22/2023. (Culter Reply Decl., Ex. A.) Further,
the witness ordinary witness costs were reasonable and necessary expenses as
Plaintiffs prepared for trial. Ford’s motion to tax these costs is denied. 
 
Defendant
Ford also challenges Item 12, which seeks $600 for “Steno” fees associated with
some undescribed “TBD” event. Plaintiff does not specifically address this cost
in reply, but the evidence substantiating the costs indicates that this was an
anticipated cost for the court reporter at the hearing on the motion for attorney
fees. (Culter Reply Decl., Ex. A.) The request to strike this cost is denied.   
 
Finally,
Defendant Ford challenges the “Other” costs in Item 13. The memorandum of costs
seeks $730.22 in the amount of “Attorney Services and Messenger Court Filings
and Service,” $93.34 for “mediation,” and $130.00 for “Appearance Attorney.” Ford
argues none of these costs are authorized by Code of Civil Procedure section
1033.5. However, only costs expressly identified as a non-recoverable costs cannot
be recovered. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5, subd. (b).) All other costs are either
expressly allowed or subject to the “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation” requirement. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5, subd. (c)(3); Rojas v. HSBC Card Services Inc. (2023) 93 Cal.App.5th 860, 892 [“The statute also
authorizes the trial court in its discretion to award or deny an item of costs
not mentioned in this section.”]; Segal v. ASICS America Corp. (2022) 12
Cal.5th 651, 658.) Here, the fees appear reasonably necessary to the litigation.

 
            Thus, costs allowed will be reduced
by a total amount of $217.35.
            
Conclusion
 
            The motion
for attorneys’ fees and costs is granted in part. In sum, the Court grants
Plaintiffs’ request for attorneys’ fees in the total
amount of $82,150.50, which is a reduction of the lodestar amount by $17,563.50.
The request for costs is granted in the reduced amount of $38,421.65.  
 
            Defendants Ford
Motor Company and Cerritos Ford Lincoln are ordered to pay to Plaintiffs’
counsel the sum of $120,572.15 ($82,150.50 + 38,421.65) for attorneys’
fees and costs. This amount shall be paid on or before November 17, 2023.
