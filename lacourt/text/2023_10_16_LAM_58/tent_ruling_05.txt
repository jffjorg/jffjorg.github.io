[1]           Defendant Ford
cites, Valdez v. FCA US LLC (C.D.
Cal., July 21, 2020, No. CV1909009ABJEMX) 2020 WL 5088093, at *2. Valdez v.
FCA US LLC involved the costs incurred by an expert witness’s travel time.


[2]           In reply, Plaintiffs
argue that these charts violate California Rules of Court rules 3.1113(d),
(g) and (h) because these charts impermissibly adds about fifty-two (52) pages
of argument in the Declaration of Hannah Biemann Exs F-G, effectively making
FMC’s Opposition sixty-six (66) pages long. Although this argument is technically
correct, the chart clarified amounts identified in the moving papers. Alternatively,
these amounts would have required the court to sift through numerous entries
without the benefit of the specific entries challenged. Ford’s opposition chart
was extremely helpful to identifying the numerous entries challenged based on
the numerous entries submitted by Plaintiffs in their evidentiary exhibits. 


[3]           Defendant Ford argues
that no evidence may be submitted in reply, citing Jay v. Mahaffey (2013) 218
Cal. App. 4th 1522, 1537-1538 for the proposition that “[p]oints raised for the
first time in a reply brief will ordinarily not be considered, because such
consideration would deprive the respondent of an opportunity to counter the
argument.” This argument is not well taken in the context costs because of the
burden shifting that occurs. “If the items appearing in a
cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to
tax costs to show that were not reasonable or necessary.” (Ladas v.
California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774; accord, Adams
v. Ford Motor Co. (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1475, 1486–1487.) “If the items
are properly objected to, they are put in issue” (Ladas, supra,
at p. 774), and “the burden shift[s] to” the party claiming costs to provide
the necessary documentation to prove those costs (Jones v. Dumrichob
(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1265; accord, Rappenecker v. Sea–Land Service,
Inc. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 256, 266.)
