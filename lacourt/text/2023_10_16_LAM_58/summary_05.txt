And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a dispute over costs incurred by an expert witness's travel time. Defendant Ford argues that the expert witness's costs are impermissible because they were not disclosed in a timely manner. However, the court finds that the costs were properly disclosed and that Defendant Ford's opposition was helpful in identifying the specific entries challenged. The court also notes that the burden shifts to the party seeking to tax costs to show that the expenses were not reasonable or necessary. The court is tentatively ruling that the costs incurred by the expert witness's travel time are permissible.
