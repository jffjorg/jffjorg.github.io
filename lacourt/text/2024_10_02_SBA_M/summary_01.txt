Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the City of Redondo Beach's motion for summary judgment, which sought to dismiss the plaintiff's claims for damages. The City argued that it did not have actual or constructive notice of the alleged defect that caused the plaintiff's slip and fall, and that the condition resulted from natural forces rather than human activity. The judge found that the City had met its burden to show that it did not have notice of the defect, but that the plaintiff had also presented evidence to show that a triable issue of material fact existed as to the reasonableness of the City's inspection system and the obviousness of the defect.

The judge also denied the Redondo Beach Unified School District's motion for summary adjudication, which sought to dismiss the plaintiff's claims against it. The District argued that it did not have control over the adjacent land where the plaintiff fell, and that it did not owe a duty of care to the plaintiff. The judge found that a triable issue of fact existed as to whether the District had control over the land, and whether it had a duty to warn the plaintiff of the alleged dangerous condition or remedy the condition.

The judge's ruling allows the case to proceed to trial, where the parties will present evidence and arguments to support their claims and defenses.
