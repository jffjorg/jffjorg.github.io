And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants, Abigail Margaret Wright and Katherine Wright, against the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) filed by the plaintiff, Kailer Lawrence. The court finds that the demurrer is improper as it targets only parts of the cause of action, and that the allegations in the SAC are sufficient to support a claim for negligence. The court overrules the demurrer to the claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress and vicarious liability.

The court also grants the motion to strike the prayer for exemplary and punitive damages, as the allegations in the SAC do not rise to the level of oppression, fraud, or malice required to support a claim for punitive damages. The court finds that the allegations are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages and that the prayer for such damages is stricken.

The court orders that the Second Amended Complaint be filed as of November 20, 2023, and that the "Fourth Amended Complaint" be stricken. The court orders the defendants to file an answer within 20 days to the SAC, which is the operative pleading.
