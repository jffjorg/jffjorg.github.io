Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer to the complaint filed by defendant Vortex Alliance, Inc. and has sustained it with five days leave to amend. The plaintiff, Jack Cheung, DBA Three-C Co., failed to comply with the fictitious business name laws, failed to attach a copy of the written agreement, and failed to sufficiently allege lawful service of the notice to quit. The court finds that the allegations are uncertain and unclear, and that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. The plaintiff is granted five days to amend the complaint to address these deficiencies.
