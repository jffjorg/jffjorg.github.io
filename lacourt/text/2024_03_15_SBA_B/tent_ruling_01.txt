LEGAL AUTHORITY
When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context. 
Taylor v. City of Los Angeles
Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th 1216, 1228.  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters. 
Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the
pleading or are judicially noticed.”  SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.  “The only issue
involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”  Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747. 
Sufficient facts are the essential facts of the case “with reasonable
precision and with particularity sufficiently specific to acquaint the
defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his cause of action.” Gressley
v. Williams (1961) 193 Cal. App. 2d 636, 643-44.
DISCUSSION
Defendant Vortex Alliance, Inc.
demurs to the complaint on the grounds that plaintiff lacks standing and the
complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action and is
uncertain.
Defendant contends that plaintiff
lacks standing because he failed to comply with the fictitious business name
laws.  Defendant also points out that
although plaintiff alleges that he attached a copy of the written agreement, it
is not attached.  Defendant argues that
the complaint fails to properly allege lawful service of the notice to quit.
There is no opposition.
The court rules as follows:  The allegations are uncertain as to whether
plaintiff complied with the fictitious business name laws.  Bus. & Prof. Code §17910 states:  “Every person who regularly transacts
business in this state for profit under a fictitious business name shall do all
of the following:  (a) File a fictitious
business name statement in accordance with this chapter not later than 40 days
from the time the registrant commences to transact such business.”  Under paragraph 2.b., plaintiff marked the
box that he has complied with the fictitious business name laws but states that
he is doing business under the fictitious name of “Vortex Alliance.”  As alleged, Vortex Alliance is a defendant.  Plaintiff does not state that he has complied
with such laws as to “dba Three-C Co.”
Plaintiff also failed to attach a
copy of the written agreement at Exhibit 1 as he alleges at para. 6.e.
Plaintiff further failed to
sufficiently allege that the three-day notice was served properly.  CCP §1162 states:  “(b) The notices required by Section 1161 may
be served upon a commercial 
tenant
by any of the following methods: (1) By delivering a copy to the tenant
personally.  (2) If he or she is absent
from the commercial rental property, by leaving a copy with some person of
suitable age and discretion at the property, and sending a copy through the
mail addressed to the tenant at the address where the property is situated.  (3) If, at the time of attempted service, a
person of suitable age or discretion is not found at the rental property
through the exercise of reasonable diligence, then by affixing a copy in a
conspicuous place on the property, and also sending a copy through the mail
addressed to the tenant at the address where the property is situated.  Service upon a subtenant may be made in the
same manner.”
Based
on the allegations it appears that plaintiff attempted to comply with CCP §1162(2)
but it is uncertain.  At para. 10.a.,
plaintiff alleges that the notice was served on the defendant by leaving a copy
with “(name or description):  Employee a
person of suitable age and discretion on 7/30/21” at defendant’s business and mailing
a copy to defendant at defendant’s place of residence on 7/5/21 because
defendant cannot be found at defendant’s residence or usual place of
business.  “Employee” is neither a name nor
a description.  Further, confusingly, plaintiff
alleges that the 3-day notice was left at the business on July 20, 2021 but
mailed on July 5, 2021 (although the notice is dated June 30, 2021 and
plaintiff alleges that the notice expired on July 5, 2021 at par. 9.b); yet the
proof of service on the 3-day notice (Exh. B) states that the notice was served
on June 30, 2021 by delivering the notice to the business and mailed on July 1,
2021.
            Thus, the demurrer is SUSTAINED WITH
LEAVE TO AMEND.
ORDER
The demurrer is SUSTAINED WITH 5
DAYS LEAVE TO AMEND. 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice of ruling.
