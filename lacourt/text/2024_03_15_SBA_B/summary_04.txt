Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendant, 1580 Centinela Associates, LLC. The Judge has sustained the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend as to the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Causes of Action in the complaint. The Sixth Cause of Action for premises liability fails because California law significantly limits third-party liability for alcohol-related accidents, and the allegations do not state a "dangerous condition" of the parking lot. The Seventh Cause of Action for general negligence fails because the allegations do not state a duty on behalf of the property owner to have prevented the incident. The Eighth Cause of Action for general negligence-loss of consortium fails because the allegations do not comply with California Rules of Court, Rule 2.112.

The Judge has also denied the motion to strike as to "loss of use," "diminution in value," prejudgment interest, and "impairment of quality of life." The Judge has ruled that the motion to strike is moot as to exemplary and punitive damages, and the amended pleading should make this clear by expressly stating that exemplary and punitive damages are not sought against the moving defendants.
