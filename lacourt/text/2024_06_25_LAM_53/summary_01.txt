Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants in part and denies in part the plaintiff's motion for a charging order and foreclosure against the defendants' membership interests in several limited liability companies. The judge orders that the defendants' membership interests be charged with the unpaid balance of the judgment, and that any distributions made to the defendants be paid directly to the plaintiff until the judgment is satisfied. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for foreclosure and sale of the transferable interests, finding that the plaintiff has not shown that distributions under the charging order will not pay the judgment debt within a reasonable time.
