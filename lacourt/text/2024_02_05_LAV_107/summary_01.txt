And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendant, Mercedes-Benz U.S.A., LLC. The defendant argues that the entire complaint is uncertain, vague, and ambiguous, and that the plaintiff has failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

The judge grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the first cause of action (breach of express warranty) with 15 days' leave to amend. The judge finds that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action because it is conclusory and lacks specific details about when the vehicle was presented to the authorized dealer and how many attempts were made to fix the issues.

The judge denies the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the second cause of action (breach of implied warranty). The judge finds that the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action because it alleges a latent defect in the vehicle and that the vehicle was not fit for driving due to defects and non-conformities.

The judge's ruling is tentative and is subject to change after further briefing and argument.
