Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the defendant's motion for a stay of proceedings pending the outcome of the criminal trial. The court finds that the defendant's rights against self-incrimination outweigh the plaintiff's interest in proceeding with the civil trial. The court also finds that staying the proceedings would be more efficient and would not prejudice the plaintiff or any third parties. The court orders that the stay will bar the defendant's discovery in the instant matter and that the trial date and all discovery related to the defendant's alleged criminal conduct will be stayed.
