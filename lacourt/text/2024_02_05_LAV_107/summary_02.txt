English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer and a motion to strike filed by the defendants in a case involving a plaintiff who was sexually assaulted by an employee of a hospital. The plaintiff filed a complaint alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress, sexual battery, negligence, and sexual harassment. The defendants argued that the claims were barred by the statute of limitations and that the plaintiff failed to state sufficient facts to support the claims.

The judge overruled the demurrer to the first and fourth causes of action, finding that the claims were timely brought and that the allegations supported the claims. The judge sustained the demurrer to the fifth cause of action, finding that the plaintiff failed to state sufficient facts to support the claim of sexual harassment.

The judge granted the motion to strike the request for punitive damages, finding that the claims were barred by California Code of Civil Procedure Section 425.13(a), which prohibits the inclusion of punitive damages in an action for damages arising out of the professional negligence of a health care provider.
