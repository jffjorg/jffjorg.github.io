[1] The Court notes the 2nd cause of action is the only
remaining claim in Plaintiffs’ SAC.  On
July 16, 2024, this Court sustained Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiffs’ 1st cause
of action in the SAC without leave to amend. 
(See 7/16/24 Minute Order.)


[2] The Court notes there are two paragraphs in the
Declaration of Kevin Abbott labeled ¶1. 
To avoid confusion, the Court refers to the second ¶1 as ¶2.
