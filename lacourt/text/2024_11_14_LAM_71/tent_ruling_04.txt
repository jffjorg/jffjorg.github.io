 Hearing Date:  November 14, 2024



 
Defendant Hankey Investment Company LP’s unopposed
motion to dismiss Plaintiff Doe aka Jerome Eady’s complaint is granted.
 
Defendant Hankey Investment Company LP
(“Hankey”) (“Defendant”) moves unopposed to dismiss pro per Plaintiff
Doe aka Jerome Eady’s (“Eady”) (“Plaintiff”) complaint on the basis he failed
to furnish a security in the amount of $90,000.00 to proceed with this
litigation, as ordered by this Court on August 7, 2024.  (Notice Motion, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §391.4.)
 
Background
On December 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed his
eleventh unlimited lawsuit against Defendant. 
On February 8, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s Motion to Declare
Jerome Eady a Vexatious Litigant.  On
March 4, 2024, the Court declared Plaintiff a vexatious litigant.  (3/4/24 Order Declaring Eady Vexatious
Litigant.)
On August 7, 2024, this Court granted
Defendant’s unopposed motion requiring Plaintiff to furnish a security in the
amount of $90,000.00 to proceed with this litigation within 10 days of the
Court’s ruling.  (8/7/24 Minute Order.)
Defendant filed the instant motion on August 19,
2024.  As of the date of this hearing no
opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
C.C.P. §391.4 states, “[w]hen security that has
been ordered furnished is not furnished as ordered, the
litigation shall be dismissed as to the defendant for whose
benefit it was ordered furnished.”  (C.C.P.
§391.4.)
 
Discussion
Defendant’s motion for an order to dismiss
Plaintiff’s complaint is granted.
On August 7, 2024, this Court granted
Defendant’s unopposed motion requiring Plaintiff to furnish a security in the
amount of $90,000.00 to proceed with this litigation within 10 days of the
Court’s ruling, pursuant to C.C.P §391.3(a). 
(8/7/24 Minute Order.)  Plaintiff failed
to furnish a security in the amount of $90,000 by August 17, 2024.  Therefore, the security that has been ordered
furnished was not furnished as ordered, and the
litigation shall be dismissed as to Defendant for whose benefit
it was ordered furnished.  (C.C.P. §391.4.)  Since Defendant is the only defendant in this
matter, the entire action must be dismissed.
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion is granted.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s unopposed motion to dismiss
the instant action is granted.
Moving Party to give notice.
