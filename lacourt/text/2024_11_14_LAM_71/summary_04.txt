And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's unopposed motion to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant, Hankey Investment Company LP, had requested that the plaintiff furnish a security in the amount of $90,000.00 to proceed with the litigation, as ordered by the court on August 7, 2024. The plaintiff failed to furnish the security by August 17, 2024, and therefore the court has dismissed the action. The judge relied on California Code of Civil Procedure (C.C.P.) §391.4, which states that when security is not furnished as ordered, the litigation shall be dismissed as to the defendant for whose benefit it was ordered furnished.
