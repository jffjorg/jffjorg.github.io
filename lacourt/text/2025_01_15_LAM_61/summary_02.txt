And here is a summary in English text:

Judge JUN JUN ZHAO denies Defendant Karena Apple Feng's motion to quash service of summons. Defendant Feng claims she was not served with the summons and was instead given irrelevant papers. However, the verified proof of service and declaration of the registered process server, Ramir Castor, show that Castor personally served the complaint and summons on June 2, 2024. Castor denies serving Defendant with the papers Defendant Feng claims to have received. The Court finds that the proof of personal service establishes a presumption of the facts stated in the return, and Defendant Feng has not rebutted this presumption. Therefore, the motion is denied.
