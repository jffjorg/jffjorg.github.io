And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to discovery requests and imposes monetary sanctions on the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to serve timely responses to the discovery requests and did not request an extension of time. The defendants served the discovery requests on September 14, 2023, and the plaintiff has not responded. As a result, the judge grants the motion to compel and awards sanctions in the amount of $1,200, based on 3 hours of counsel's hourly rate of $400. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery and oppose the motion warrants the imposition of sanctions.
