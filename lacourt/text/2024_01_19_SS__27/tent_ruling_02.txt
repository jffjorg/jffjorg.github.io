      CASE NO.: 20STCV23221
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR ORDER COMPELLING DEFENDANT CALIFORNIA
  COMMERCE CLUB, INC RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY
 
Dept.

  p.m.

On June 18, 2020, Plaintiff Angelina Yu
filed this action against Defendants Coach Max Corp. (“Defendant”) and
California Commerce Club, Inc. (“CCC”). On November 9, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
instant motion to compel Defendant CCC’s responses to Form Interrogatories. The
motion is unopposed.
Compel Responses
Where a party fails to serve timely
responses to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 403.)   A party that fails to serve
timely responses waives any objections to the request, including ones based on
privilege or the protection of attorney work product.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a),
2031.300, subd. (a).)  Unlike a motion to
compel further responses, a motion to
compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit and the propounding
party has no meet and confer obligations. 
(Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at
p. 404.)
Here, Plaintiff served Form
Interrogatories on Defendant CCC on August 28, 2023. Defendant has not
responded or requested an extension of time. (Xu Decl., ¶¶4-9.) Accordingly,
the motion to compel responses is GRANTED. 
The Court notes that Plaintiff did not
request sanctions in the notice of motion as required under CCP § 2023.040.
Thus, sanctions are not imposed.
Moving party to give notice.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
