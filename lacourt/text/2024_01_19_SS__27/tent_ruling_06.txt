LLC 
 
I.         BACKGROUND
On
August 29, 2022, Plaintiff Hector Hipolito (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint
against Defendants M2 Concrete Pumping, LLC (“M2”), Catalina Pacific Concrete
Company (“CPCC”), Always Pumping, Builders Firstsource-Atlantic Group, LLC, and
Does 1-50, alleging 1) negligence and 2) premises liability. 
This
action arises out of injuries sustained by Plaintiff while he was working at a
construction site. On March 31, 2021, Plaintiff was hired by non-party
Bercow-Byrne Construction Company to place and finish concrete for a project
located at 3860 Grand View Blvd., in Los Angeles, CA (“the Premises”). CPCC
provided, supplied, and/or operated the concrete trucks, drivers, and concrete
for the project. M2 provided concrete pumping services, as well as pumping
equipment. At all relevant times, CPCC was supplying concrete from its concrete
truck to M2 in order to pump and place concrete. That day, Plaintiff was
injured when he was placing and finishing concrete that came from a negligently
maintained and operated concrete truck. 
On
January 12, 2023, CPCC propounded request for production of documents to M2, set two.
(Martin Decl., ¶ 2.) 
On
February 17, 2023, M2 served responses. (Martin Decl., ¶ 3.) With respect to
Requests Nos. 38 and 39, M2’s responses included an objection, but
no response. (Ibid.) 
On
September 21, 2023, CPCC requested an IDC. 
On
September 26, 2023, M2 served its first supplemental responses to request nos.
37, 38, and 39. (Martin Decl., ¶ 6.) CPCC believed that the responses and
objections were not code-compliant. 
On
October 6, 2023, an IDC was held. There, M2 contends the parties agreed to the
Court’s recommendations that RPDs Nos. 38 and 39 were to be limited to five
years and that the term vehicle would be limited to eight specific categories
of documents related to M2 pump truck and related equipment, as follows: boom,
hopper, remote control, line, reducer, pump, emergency stop, and electrical
systems. (Gagliano Decl., ¶ 11.) However, CPCC contends it understood that it
would limit the requests to five years but not limit the requests to the
categories described above. (Martin Decl., ¶ 8.)
A
notice of outcome was served on October 20, 2023. (Martin Decl., ¶ 9.) 
Counsel
for CPCC again expressed that the requests would not be limited to the
categories discussed above. (Martin Decl., ¶ 10.)
On
November 3, 2023, M2 served its second set of supplemental responses to CPCC’s
RPDs, set two, with replies limited to the categories above. (Martin Decl., ¶¶
11-12.)
On
December 8, 2023, CPCC sent a meet and confer letter to M2 expressing that it
had not agreed to limit the responses to the specified categories and set a
deadline of December 15, 2023 to respond. (Martin Decl., ¶¶ 11-12.) 
On
December 20, 2023, after not receiving a response, CPCC filed the instant
motion to compel M2’s further responses to requests for production, set two,
and request for sanctions. 
On
January 10, 2024, M2 filed an opposition. 
On
January 12, 2024, CPCC filed a reply.
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
Compelling
Further Responses to Requests for Production
A
motion to compel further responses to a demand for inspection or production of
documents (“RFP”) may be
brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2) inadequate,
evasive or incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly
generalized objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(c).) 
A
motion to compel further production must set forth specific facts showing good
cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand. (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310(b)(1).) It is not necessary for the motion to show that the
material sought will be admissible in evidence. “Good
cause” may be found to justify discovery where specific facts show that the
discovery is necessary for effective trial preparation or to prevent surprise
at trial. (See Associated Brewers Dist. Co. v. Superior Court (1967) 65 Cal.2d
583, 586-588; see also CCP §§ 2017.010, 2019.030(a)(1) (Information is
discoverable if it is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and it is not
unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source
that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive.); Lipton v.
Superior Court (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1611-1612 (noting a party may obtain
discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject
matter involved in the pending action, if the matter either is itself
admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence).) 
Motions
to compel further responses must always be accompanied by a meet-and
confer-declaration (per Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040) demonstrating a “reasonable and good faith attempt an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.”  (Id., §§
2030.300(b), 2031.310(b)(2), 2033.290(b).)  They must also be accompanied
by a separate statement containing the requests and the responses, verbatim, as
well as reasons why a further response is warranted.  (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(a).)  The separate statement must also be complete in
itself; no extrinsic materials may be incorporated by reference.  (Id.,
rule 3.1345(c).) 
III.      DISCUSSION
Further
Responses
CPCC
seeks an order compelling M2 to produce further responses to CPCC’s requests
for production, set two.  
CPCC
contends that M2’s responses to RPDs No. 38 and 39 are not code-compliant
because M2 failed to specify whether the documents requested were ever in their
possession, improperly attempted to limit the scope of the requests, and
responded with objections that were waived with untimely responses. CPCC
further contends M2’s objections are overbroad. Finally, CPCC contends that M2
improperly asserted additional objections in their second set of supplemental
responses. 
CPCC
contends that good cause exists to compel production of further responses
because M2 was the owner and operator of the truck at the time of the accident
and Plaintiff alleges that a malfunction or negligent maintenance of the truck
caused his injury. Therefore, the maintenance and inspection records pertaining
to the subject vehicle are relevant to the liability investigation and whether
Plaintiff’s vehicle had any underlying defects.
Nos.
38 and 39
RPD
No. 38 requests: “All maintenance records created in the past ten years for
YOUR vehicle that was pumping concrete at the time of the SUBJECT INCIDENT.”
RPD
No. 39 requests: “All inspection records created in the past ten years for YOUR
vehicle that was pumping concrete at the time of the SUBJECT INCIDENT.”
M2’s
responses to each request were similar. M2’s initial response was objections on
the grounds of relevance, overbreadth, vagueness, ambiguity, and uncertainty.
M2’s supplemental response was that it was not in actual or constructive
possession of any documents related to the routine maintenance and operation of
the subject vehicle. M2’s second supplemental response was that it did not have
maintenance records relating to any of the following eight categories: the
truck’s boom, the truck’s hopper, the truck’s remote control, the truck’s line,
the truck’s reducer, the truck’s pump, the truck’s emergency stop, the truck’s
electrical systems.
The
Court finds that M2’s objections to CPCC’s RPDs are without merit. The
inspection and maintenance records of the vehicle alleged to have caused
Plaintiff’s injuries are clearly relevant to the issue of liability.
Furthermore, the requests are sufficiently narrow, unambiguous, and certain in
that they request the records of strictly the subject vehicle. 
The
Court further finds that the responses, which unilaterally define the scope of
the request into 8 “sub-categories” are non-compliant.  Thus, the Court hereby GRANTS M2’s motion to
compel and orders M2 to provide supplemental responses within 20 days of this
date.  
Sanctions
CPCC
also requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,680.00 against M2 to be
paid within 30 days of this hearing for misuse of the discovery process. CPCC
alleges that it gave M2 multiple discovery deadline extensions and
opportunities to provide sufficient responses without judicial intervention.
CPCC’s
counsel, Dennis Martin, expended 7 hours in pursuit of this matter, including
drafting the motion, and expected to spend 2-3 hours drafting the reply. His
hourly rate is $240.00.  
In
opposition, M2 asserts that it is entitled to sanctions against CPCC in the
amount of $1,520.00 for 7.6 hours at a $200/hour rate for having to prepare
this opposition and appear at the hearing on this motion. M2 contends that CPCC
did not meet and confer in good faith. 
The
Court grants sanctions to CPCC in the reasonable amount of $1000 jointly and
severally against M2 and its counsel pursuant to CCP sections 2023.030 and 2023.090.  The Court does not agree with M2 that CPCC
failed to meet and confer in good faith and therefore denies CPCC’s request for
sanctions.
