Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that Defendant Authentic8, Inc.'s motion for summary judgment is GRANTED. The Court finds that Cuerdon, an employee of Authentic8, was not acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident. The Court concludes that Cuerdon's intent at the time of the accident was to go to dinner with his girlfriend, and there is no evidence that he intended to conduct any business at dinner or after dinner. The Court also finds that Cuerdon was not driving a company vehicle and was not on his way to a work-related activity at the time of the accident. Therefore, Authentic8 is not liable for Cuerdon's actions. The Plaintiff's opposition to the motion for summary judgment is rejected.
