I.       INTRODUCTION
           On October 19, 2018, Plaintiff Stephen Harris
(“Plaintiff”) filed his Complaint against Defendant Jack Swank (“Decedent”), in
his individual capacity, for damages arising from an automobile accident. On
October 20, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Creditor’s Claim, and after rejection,
Plaintiff brought a motion to substitute Judith Lorraine Swank (“Swank” or
“Defendant”) as the personal representative of Decedent. On August 29, 2023,
the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to substitute. Accordingly, it was ordered
that Swank be substituted as a party defendant in place of Decedent; Plaintiff
was ordered to serve Swank with an amended complaint within 20 days of the
ruling. (Min. Order Aug. 29, 2023.)
          On
September 15, 2023, Defendant filed a demurrer to the Complaint.
          On
September 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed an “Amended Complaint” asserting a single
cause of action for Negligence. The “Amended Complaint” is deemed “Received” in
the Court’s electronic case file. The proof of service attached to the filing
shows Plaintiff was personally served with the “Amended Complaint” on September
18, 2023.
On September
29, 2023, Defendant filed an amended demurrer to the Complaint. 
On October 5,
2023, Plaintiff filed an “Amended Complaint (1st)” which appears as “Filed” and
“Granted” in the Court’s electronic case file. 
          On
October 31, 2023, Defendants’ demurrers were heard, and the Court indicated in
its tentative ruling that the demurrer would be sustained with leave to amend
on the ground that Defendant was named in her in her individual capacity rather
than the representative of Decedent. (Min. Order Oct. 31, 2023 at pg. 3.)
However, because of the lack of clarity with the pleadings at issue, the Court
heard oral argument from the parties. (Id. at pg. 4.) The hearing for
Defendant’s demurrers was also continued to November 27, 2023. (Ibid.)
          On
November 13, 2023, Defendant filed a brief regarding her demurrer, indicating
that Plaintiff’s counsel mispresented that Defendant was represented at prior
hearings.
          On
December 4, 2023, the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer on the ground that
the amended pleading Defendant was sued in her individual capacity, not
representative capacity, which did not comply with the Court’s prior leave to
amend. 
          On
December 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against
Defendant, as the personal representative of Decedent, alleging a claim for
negligence. 
          On
December 13, 2023, Defendant filed a demurrer to the SAC that Plaintiff
opposed.
          On
January 11, 2024, the Court heard the Demurrer and tentatively OVERRULED it,
but continued the matter to specifically consider the issue of whether Plaintiff
complied with Probate Code Section 9000 et. seq., and , in particular, Probate
Code Section 9370.  The Court wanted to
consider whether or not the issue had been previously addressed in this case
and thus was the law of the case.  Having
reviewed the August 2, 2023 minute order issued in this case, the Court finds
that the issue was previously addressed, with the Court explicitly finding that
Plaintiff “satisfied the requirement of Probate Code Section 9370.”  Accordingly, the Court adopts the tentative
ruling of January 13, 2024, as its ruling today.  Having previously heard argument on other
issues contained in that ruling, it will limit argument today, if any, to
argument relating to Probate Code Section 9000 et. seq.
  Moving party to give notice.
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating
intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided
on the court website at www.lacourt.org. 
Please be advised that if you submit on the tentative and elect not to
appear at the hearing, the opposing party may nevertheless appear at the
hearing and argue the matter.  Unless you
receive a submission from all other parties in the matter, you should assume
that others might appear at the hearing to argue.  If the Court does not receive emails from the
parties indicating submission on this tentative ruling and there are no
appearances at the hearing, the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the
tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
Dated
this 19th day of January 2024
