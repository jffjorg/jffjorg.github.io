Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.                 
The court notes that the lease agreement (attached as
Exhibit 4c to the Declaration of James Sattler [“Sattler”]) provides for a
security deposit of $11,207.17 (see pg. ii). It is unclear to the court whether
or not the security deposit has been applied to the amount outstanding or
credited back to Defendant. The court requests that a supplemental declaration
be provided in this regard.
2.                 
The court requests that Plaintiff explain how the
$11,590.00 monthly rent was calculated. 
3.                 
Attorney fees should be reduced to $2,645.41 (i.e.,
based on the $87,770.73 demand of complaint), pursuant to Local Rule 3.214.
