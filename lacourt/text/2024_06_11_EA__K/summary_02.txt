Here is the English text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Shuangshuang Li v. Guotao Huang, dismissing the plaintiff's complaint with leave to amend. The plaintiff had alleged that the defendant, Guotao Huang, had agreed to remodel her Diamond Bar home for $110,000, but had performed substandard work and demanded full payment before completing the work. The defendant had filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that the allegations did not state a cause of action and were uncertain. The judge has sustained the demurrer, ruling that the plaintiff's allegations against the defendant are derivative of claims against Vanke Home Remodel, Inc. and are insufficient to state a cause of action. The judge has given the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to cure the defects.
