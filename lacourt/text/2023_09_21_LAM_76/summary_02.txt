And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff and a request for sanctions. The plaintiff, a former employee of the defendant, Southern California Permanente Medical Group, alleges that she was terminated due to her race, perceived disability, and for violating policies that were never articulated to her. The defendant moves to compel the plaintiff's deposition and requests sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel.

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition, ordering the deposition to occur within 10 days. The judge also grants the defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel, imposing a reduced amount of $1,584.15, jointly and severally. The sanctions are to be paid to the defendant's counsel within 10 days.

The judge's ruling is based on the plaintiff's failure to appear for her deposition, which was noticed and cancelled twice, and the defendant's counsel's efforts to schedule an alternative date. The judge finds that the defendant is entitled to an order compelling the plaintiff's deposition and that the plaintiff's counsel has not made any effort to provide alternative dates for the deposition. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's counsel's position that he has no obligation to schedule the deposition is not justified.
