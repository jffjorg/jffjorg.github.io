And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff and a request for sanctions. The plaintiff, a former employee of the defendant, Southern California Permanente Medical Group, alleges that she was terminated due to her race, perceived disability, and for violating policies that were never articulated to her. The defendant moves to compel the plaintiff's deposition and requests sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel.

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition, ordering the deposition to occur within 10 days. The judge also grants the defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel, imposing a reduced amount of $1,584.15, jointly and severally. The sanctions are to be paid to the defendant's counsel within 10 days.

The judge's ruling is based on the plaintiff's failure to appear for her deposition, which was noticed and cancelled twice, and the defendant's counsel's efforts to schedule an alternative date. The judge finds that the defendant is entitled to an order compelling the plaintiff's deposition and that the plaintiff's counsel has not made any effort to provide alternative dates for the deposition. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's counsel's position that he has no obligation to schedule the deposition is not justified.

The tentative ruling for the case 22STCV15220, scheduled for a hearing on September 21, 2023, in Department 76 of the Los Angeles County Superior Court, is as follows:

Defendant Southern California Permanente Medical Group's motion to compel Plaintiff's deposition is granted. The deposition is to occur within 10 days. Defendant's request for sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel is granted in the reduced amount of $1,584.15, jointly and severally. Sanctions are to be paid to Defendant's counsel within 10 days.

The ruling is based on the analysis of the applicable laws, including California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.450 and 2025.280(a). Plaintiff has twice cancelled the continued session of her noticed deposition the day before, without providing alternative dates. Defendant's counsel inquired about the non-appearance, and Plaintiff's counsel has taken the position that he has no obligation to schedule his own client's deposition. Therefore, Defendant is entitled to an order compelling Plaintiff's deposition. Additionally, sanctions are granted due to Plaintiff's failure to comply with the deposition notice.
