## English Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiffs' motion to tax costs. 

The plaintiffs, Angel and Teresa Meza, leased a 2016 Kia Optima and alleged defects, leading to a judgment in favor of the defendant, Kia Motors America, Inc.

The plaintiffs argued that Kia should not be able to recover costs because:

1. Kia's cost recovery attempt under Civil Procedure Code § 998 was not made in good faith. 
2. The Song-Beverly Act only allows prevailing buyers, not defendants, to recover attorney's fees and expenses.

The judge disagreed with both arguments, stating that:

* Kia is the prevailing party and entitled to recover costs as a matter of right.
* Neither the Song-Beverly Act nor § 998 limits Kia's cost recovery.

The judge found that Kia sufficiently documented the $5,493.08 in filing/motion fees and deposition costs it seeks to recover.  


Therefore, the plaintiffs' motion to reduce Kia's recoverable costs was denied in its entirety.

## English Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiffs' motion to tax costs. 

The plaintiffs, Angel and Teresa Meza, had leased a Kia Optima and sued Kia Motors America, Inc. alleging defects. The court ruled in favor of Kia, making it the prevailing party. 

Kia then sought to recover its costs, including filing fees and deposition expenses. The plaintiffs argued that Kia wasn't entitled to these costs, citing a lack of good faith in their settlement offer and claiming that the Song-Beverly Act only allows prevailing buyers to recover costs.

The judge found these arguments unpersuasive, stating that Kia is entitled to recover costs as the prevailing party under the Civil Procedure Code. The judge also found that Kia had adequately documented its costs. 


Therefore, the motion to tax costs is denied in its entirety.

### English Text Summary
The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiffs' motion to tax the defendant's costs in its entirety. The plaintiffs, Angel Meza and Teresa Meza, had leased a 2016 Kia Optima and alleged that it had various defects, including a defective engine. The court had previously entered judgment in favor of the defendant, Kia Motors America, Inc. The plaintiffs argued that the defendant should not be allowed to recover costs because the offer to compromise under Civ. Proc. Code, § 998 was not made in good faith and was therefore invalid. They also argued that the Song-Beverly Act only allows prevailing buyers to recover attorney's fees and expenses, not prevailing defendants. However, the judge found that the defendant is the prevailing party under Civ. Proc. Code, § 1032(a)(4) and is entitled to recover costs as a matter of right. The judge also found that the defendant's memorandum of costs is sufficient and that the plaintiffs have not provided any persuasive argument to tax the costs. The defendant is seeking to recover filing and motion fees in the amount of $2,715.83 and deposition costs in the amount of $2,777.25, which are allowable under Civ. Proc. Code, § 1033.5(a)(1) and (3).
