And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 21STCV14986, involving a lawsuit filed by Angel Meza and Teresa Meza against Kia Motors America, Inc. over a defective 2016 Kia Optima. The Plaintiffs are seeking to tax the Defendant's memorandum of costs, but the Judge has denied their motion in its entirety. The Judge found that the Defendant is the prevailing party, entitled to recover costs under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1032(a) as a matter of right. The Defendant's costs include filing and motion fees and deposition costs, which are allowable under Section 1033.5(a)(1) and (3). The Judge also found that the Defendant has sufficiently explained these costs and that the Plaintiffs' argument to tax the costs is not persuasive.
