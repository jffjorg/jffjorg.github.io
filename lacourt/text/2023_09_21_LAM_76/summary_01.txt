## English Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiffs' motion to tax costs. 

The plaintiffs, Angel and Teresa Meza, leased a 2016 Kia Optima and alleged defects, leading to a judgment in favor of the defendant, Kia Motors America, Inc.

The plaintiffs argued that Kia should not be able to recover costs because:

1. Kia's cost recovery attempt under Civil Procedure Code § 998 was not made in good faith. 
2. The Song-Beverly Act only allows prevailing buyers, not defendants, to recover attorney's fees and expenses.

The judge disagreed with both arguments, stating that:

* Kia is the prevailing party and entitled to recover costs as a matter of right.
* Neither the Song-Beverly Act nor § 998 limits Kia's cost recovery.

The judge found that Kia sufficiently documented the $5,493.08 in filing/motion fees and deposition costs it seeks to recover.  


Therefore, the plaintiffs' motion to reduce Kia's recoverable costs was denied in its entirety.
