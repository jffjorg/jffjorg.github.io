 Case Number:  23PSCV00365    Hearing Date:   June 18, 2024    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
DEFENDANT HUSSEIN ABIDALI, D.O.'S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF
MOTION TO STRIKE PORTIONS OF THE FOURTH AMENDED COMPLAINT is GRANTED
without leave to amend.  
 
Background
 
This is an elder abuse case. Plaintiff EVANGELINE MUNOZ
(“decedent” or “Ms. Munoz”), in and through her Successor-In-Interest, Jenny
Macias, and JENNY MACIAS allege the following against Defendants CASA COLINA
HOSPITAL; CASA COLINA HOSPITAL & CENTERS FOR HEALTHCARE dba CASA COLINA
HOSPITAL; CASA COLINA, INC (hereinafter, “Casa Colina”).; JALAL BADDAY, M.D
(“Dr. Badday”).; HUSSEIN ABIDALI, D.O (“Dr. Abidali”): Ms. Munoz was a resident
of Casa Colina from March 27, 2022 to April 22, 2022 where she was admitted for
rehabilitative care following a stroke. Dr. Badday was Ms. Munoz’s attending
physician. Due to her poor appetite, Ms. Munoz required one-on-one supervision
to ensure she adequately ate. Additionally, Ms. Munoz was to be monitored for a
urinary tract infection (“UTI”) and perform bladder scans every six hours. On
April 6, 2022, decedent was diagnosed with depression, and prescribed
medication, which severely reduced her appetite severely. Thus, Ms. Munoz’s
physicians began discussing the possibility of a G-tube insertion due to their
concern of her lack of eating. On April 14, 2022, Dr. Abidali performed the
G-tube placement, but it was later determined that the tube was improperly
place, leading to an infection. After an emergency surgery, Ms. Munoz suffered
at least one additional stroke, leading her to become severely impaired and put
in a semi-vegetative state, where she remained in a semi-vegetative state until
her passing on September 11, 2022.  
 
On February 7, 2023, Plaintiffs filed suit for:

3. Willful Misconduct 
4. Wrongful Death. 
 
On September 20, 2023, the court granted Dr. Badday’s motion
to abate proceedings (as to the wrongful death COA). That same day, Plaintiffs
filed their second amended complaint (SAC) naming Daniel Munoz as a named
Plaintiff.[1]

AMENDED COMPLAINT.’
 
On June 11, 2024, Dr. Abidali filed his reply. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 435, 436, and 437 govern
motions to strike. 
 
The court may properly strike from a pleading any
irrelevant, false, or improper matters. (Code Civ. Proc. § 436.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 435 provides that “any party, within the time allowed to
respond to a pleading, may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the
whole or any part thereof . . .” Code of Civil Procedure section 436, in turn,
provides: 
 
The court may, upon a motion made
pursuant to section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any pleading. (b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of
the court. 
 
The motion to strike can also be
used to strike an entire cause of action, prayer, or "pleading." (Code
Civ. Proc. § 435(a)(2).)
 
Discussion
 
Dr. Abidali seeks to strike certain portions of the 4AC that
assert (i) negligence per se and (ii) a custodial relationship. 
 
i.                
Negligence Per Se 
 
Absent violation of a statute, negligence per se cannot be
alleged. (MTS pp. 4-5, citing Quiroz v. Seventh Ave. Ctr. (2006) 140
Cal.App.4th 1256, 1285.)  
 
Here, the 4AC alleges various statutes (4AC ¶111, pp.
28-29), such as 22 C.C.R. § 70217 (‘Nursing Service Staff’), but none are
applicable to Dr. Abidali. 
 
Therefore, because none of the statutes identified in the
complaint are capable of being violated by Dr. Abidali, negligence per se has
not and cannot be alleged as to him. (MTS p. 5.)
 
ii.              
Custodial Relationship 
 
According to the court’s 11/9/2023 ruling, the court
determined that the FAC failed to allege sufficient facts to create a custodial
relationship between Dr. Abidali and decedent because his interaction with
decedent was limited to the insertion of the G-tube; however, a
custodial relationship requires more than a limited interaction. (See
11/9/2023 ruling, citing Winn v. Pioneer Medical Group (2016) 63 Cal.4th
148, 158.) Effectively, Plaintiffs withdrew the claim for Elder Abuse against
Dr. Abidali, alleging it only as to the Casa Colina co-defendants. (MTS p. 6.)
Thus, it is unclear why the 4AC still asserts allegations related to Dr.
Abidali being a care custodian of Decedent. (See e.g., 4AC ¶ 20 [“At all times
relevant … Dr. ABIDALI…act[ed] as [a] ‘care custodian[]’….”]; ¶ 22 [“Dr.
ABIDALI …act[ed] as [a] custodial caregiver[] for [decedent]”.].) 
 
Therefore, given that no elder abuse claim is alleged as to
Dr. Abidali and there are no allegations to support such an allegation, the court
strikes the conclusory allegations of custodial care from the 4AC. 
 
Though the parties met and conferred, it is unclear why
Plaintiffs did not file a stipulation and/or why the hearing was not taken off
calendar when Plaintiffs filed a notice of non-opposition to the motion.[2]

 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the MTS is granted in its entirety
without leave to amend.
