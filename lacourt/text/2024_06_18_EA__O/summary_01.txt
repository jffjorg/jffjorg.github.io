Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The main reason for the denial is that the Plaintiff did not provide clear explanations for the damages being sought. The court also notes that the Plaintiff has changed his name and that there may be related cases that have been dismissed. The court admonishes counsel to address these issues on the next court date. The court has denied the Plaintiff's default judgment application three times due to lack of clarity on damages.
