Request for Entry of Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
 
Background
 
This is a negligence
case. Plaintiff Jin Hong alleges the following against Defendants MICHELLE KIM
(“Kim”); JOSEPH DINGLASAN, M.D MEEIN MEDICAL CORPORATION dba EBEN EZER MEDICAL
CLINIC (“Clinic”) and Doe Defendants[1]:
In July 2018, Kim performed a laser treatment on Plaintiff’s face that caused
permanent scarring and disfigurement. Plaintiff later learned that, despite
representations, Kim was unlicensed and unqualified to perform the treatment. 
 
On March
2, 2020, Plaintiff filed suit alleging the following COAs:
 
1.    
Negligence
2.    
Negligent
Misrepresentation
3.    
Fraud-Concealment
4.

5.

6.

Damages
 
On July
13, 2020, Kim filed a demurrer and a cross complaint against Plaintiff and
Douglas Borthwick alleging, inter alia, COAs for civil extortion and breach of
settlement agreement.
 
On July
27, 2020, default was entered against Dr. Dinglasan. 
 
On
February 22, 2021, the court adopted its tentative ruling on Kim’s demurrer,
which to take the demurrer off calendar due to numerous unsuccessful attempts
at contacting Kim to reschedule the demurrer. (No appearances by Defendant(s)
at the hearing.) The court also set two OSCs: “Order to Show Cause Re: Failure
to File Proof of Service as to Defendant Meein Medical Corporation is scheduled
for 04/13/21 at 08:30 AM in Department J at Pomona Courthouse South. Order to
Show Cause Re: Sanctions for Defendant, Michelle Kim's, Failure to Appear is
scheduled for 04/13/21 at 08:30 AM in Department J at Pomona Courthouse South.”
 
On April
13, 2021, the court issued, in relevant part, the following minute order:
“There is no appearance by defendant this date. The Order to Show Cause for
plaintiff's failure to serve defendant Meein Medical Corporation is held and
discharged. Defendant has been served. On the Court's own motion, the Case
Management Conference scheduled for 04/13/2021, and Order to Show Cause Re:
Sanctions for Defendant, Michelle Kim's, Failure to Appear scheduled for
04/13/2021 are continued to 06/04/21 at 08:30 AM in Department J at Pomona
Courthouse South. The Order to Show Cause is continued for possible terminating
sanctions, including plaintiff's request to strike defendant's demurrer.”
 
On
April 29, 2021, default was entered against the Clinic. 
 
On June 4,
2021, the court in its minute order stated the following: “Defendant Michelle
Kim failed to appear for the third time. Case Management Conference is held.
Plaintiff may proceed by way of Default Judgement.”
 
On June
7, 2021, default was entered against Kim.
 
On
November 8, 2021, Plaintiff filed a substitution of attorney indicating that he
was no longer pro per and that Douglas Borthwick would be his attorney.
 
On
November 17, 2021, the court, on its own, filed an order of dismissal
indicating that “the within action is dismissed without prejudice as to Douglas
Macmillan Borthwick, et al.”[2]
The minute order states the following: “The Court and counsel confer in regards
to the non-jury trial. The Court takes the non-jury trial off calendar. Order
to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment is scheduled for 05/05/22 at 08:30 AM in
Department R at Pomona Courthouse South. There being no appearance by
defendants. The Court orders Douglas Macmillan Borthwick and Jin Hong in
Cross-Complaint filed by Michelle Kim on 07/13/2020 dismissed without
prejudice.”
 
On May 12,
2022, according to the minute order Regarding the OSC re: Default Judgment, no
parties appeared such that the court set two OSCs: Order to Show Cause Re:
Plaintiff and Defendant's Failure to Appear on 5/12/2022 is scheduled for
08/17/2022 at 08:30 AM in Department R at Pomona Courthouse South. Order to
Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Plaintiff's Failure to Prosecute Case.
 
On March
15, 2023, the court adopted its tentative ruling regarding the default judgment
as final. The tentative ruling denied the default judgment for the following
main reason: 
 
However,
those defects aside, there is a more significant reason why the matter is
denied with prejudice: there appear to be a total of three related cases (the
instant case, Case 20PSCV00055 and 19PSCV00577).[2] Moreover, not only did
Plaintiff not notify the court of the related cases (which it must have
done),[3] but the failure to do so may be an attempt to circumvent claim or
issue preclusion defenses, which may altogether have been grounds to dismiss
this instant action with prejudice. Furthermore, Plaintiff appears to have
changed his name from Guifeng Zhang (see Case 20PSCV00055) to Jin Hong, perhaps
again attempt to circumvent any defenses. 

 
On March
24, 2023, the court issued the following in its minute order: “The Court
admonishes Counsel to address the issues detailed in the above indicated ruling
on the next court date. Pursuant to the request of plaintiff, the Order to Show
Cause Re: Default Judgment scheduled for 05/24/2023 is continued to 08/25/2023
at 09:00 AM in Department O at Pomona Courthouse South.”
 
On August
22, 2023, Plaintiff filed two notices of related cases.
 
On August
29, 2023, the court denied the notice of related case(s) as both 19PSCV00577
and 20STCV08390 were dismissed. 
 
On
November 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed his default judgment application material. 
 
On
November 30, 2023, the court continued the default judgment hearing as
Plaintiff filed the material but one day before the hearing.  
 
On January
17, 2024, the court denied Plaintiff’s default judgment application.
 
On
February 20, 2024, Plaintiff refiled its application material. 
 
On March
19, 2024, the court denied Plaintiff’s third application for default judgment
because it was unclear the damages sought. 
 
On May 8,
9, and the 21, Plaintiff filed various filings in support of his default
judgment application. 
 
Discussion
 
According
to the JUD-100 form filed on 5/08/24, Plaintiff seeks $900,000, jointly and
severally, against Defendants Michelle Kim, Dr. Dinglasan, and the Clinic.
According to the form, the $900,000 in damages is comprised of general damages
due to permanent facial scarring, permanent emotional and psychological damage,
pain and suffering and special damages for past, present, and future treatment.
 
Here,
there are two defects with the application. 
 
Plaintiff
does not provide exactly what monetary value constitutes general damages and
special damages. According to Plaintiff’s declaration (filed on 5/09/24),
estimated future treatment will exceed $60,000. (Plaintiff’s Decl., ¶13, p.
3.) That leaves a presumed $840,000 in general damages, which leads to the
second problem. 
 
“The only person whose
pain and suffering is relevant in calculating a general damage award is the
plaintiff... How others would feel if placed in the plaintiff's position
is irrelevant… No amount of expert testimony on the value of life could possibly
help a jury decide that difficult question. (Loth v. Truck-A-Way Corp. (1998)
60 Cal.App.4th 757, 764-64.) 
 

Here, while the permanent damage,
burns and disfiguration have undoubtedly caused pain and suffering, absent an
explanation by Plaintiff, this court does not find $840,000 in general damages
reasonable. 
 
Therefore,
Plaintiff is to prove-up his general damages.[3]

 
Conclusion
 
Based on
the foregoing two defects, the application is denied without prejudice.
