And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Avalonbay Communities, Inc.'s motion to quash Plaintiff Christopher Gjertson's deposition subpoena for production of business records to Burbank Housing Authority. The judge found that the requested material is relevant to Gjertson's claim of negligence against Avalonbay and is not oppressive or harassing. Avalonbay argued that the subpoena is a "fishing expedition" and that Gjertson cannot obtain the records without a valid reason, but the judge did not find this defense sufficient to justify quashing the subpoena. The judge also denied Avalonbay's request for sanctions, finding that the motion was not made or opposed in bad faith or without substantial justification.
