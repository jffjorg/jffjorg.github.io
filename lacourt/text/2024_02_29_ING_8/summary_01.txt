Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to relieve it from forfeiture of the lease agreement dated July 27, 2015, on the condition that the defendant pays the back rent due in full by close of business on February 29, 2024. The judge balances the equities on both sides, considering the hardship to the tenant if the forfeiture is declared and the likely prejudice to the landlord if it is not. The defendant has submitted a declaration and supporting documents, including a cashier's check for $110,551, representing the COVID-related past due obligation from April 2020 to May 2021. The defendant has also spent significant amounts on improvements to the leased premises and has kept up current rent payments since those that came due during the April 2020 to May 2021 period. The judge finds that the risk of the defendant failing to pay future rents appears to be mitigated, and grants the motion to relieve the defendant from forfeiture.
