Significant Statements:

```

The judge's tentative ruling is that:

* The motion to compel deposition of Defendant's PMQ and production of documents is ARGUE, meaning the parties will need to argue the issue further before the judge makes a final decision.
* The judge will not impose evidentiary sanctions at this time, but will consider it during the motion in limine phase of the case.
* The judge will defer the issue of monetary sanctions pending the conclusion of the merits of the motion.
