            This
action arises from a breach of commercial lease. Plaintiff Tarzana Investment,
LLC 
(Plaintiff) sued Defendant Davit Hazryan (Defendant), asserting a single cause of
action for a breach of contract (and a common count). Plaintiff alleged
Defendant now owes $45,540.50.
            
            The
Complaint was filed on June 23, 2023. On October 24, 2023, default was entered against
Defendant Hazryan. Does 1-10 have been dismissed.
 
            Plaintiff
now moves for entry of default judgment against Defendant. The request for
entry of default judgment is denied. 
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
seeks default judgment in the amount of $62,713.60, which includes $6,823.44 in
interest, $710.66 in costs, and $1,954.50 in attorney fees. 
 
            Plaintiff
avers that, on August 7, 2019, it entered into a written Standard
Industrial/Commercial Multi-Tenant Lease (Lease) with Defendant for rental of
certain real property to operate a jewelry store. (Abrams Decl., ¶ 2; Compl.,
Ex. A.) Thereafter, in October 2022, Defendant fell behind on the required
monthly payments and, as of October 2023, the total amount of $53,225 is now
owed on the Lease. (Abrams Decl., ¶ 2.) Plaintiff has submitted sufficient
evidence to support the breach of the Lease and the resulting damages.
 
            However,
the amount sought for entry of default judgment exceeds the amount requested in
the Complaint. Specifically, the Complaint seeks damages in an amount “not less
than $45,540.50.” (Compl., Prayer ¶ 1.) 
 
            The Legislature has provided that a default judgment “cannot exceed that
demanded in the complaint.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, 585, subds. (a), (b).)
“[A] default judgment greater than the amount specifically demanded is
void as beyond the [trial] court's jurisdiction.” (Greenup v. Rodman
(1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 826, [italics added].) A default judgment is also void if
the required statement of damages was not served on the defendant before
the default was taken. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th
1495, 1521.)
 
            Accordingly, the Court cannot enter
default judgment in the amount requested. 
 
            Further,
both the pre-judgment interest calculation and the attorney fee calculation are
based on this improper damage amount. 
 
            Additionally,
Plaintiff improperly calculated its pre-judgment interest. Plaintiff seeks
interest on the amount of $53,225, accruing at 10% from the date of October 1,
2022 (date of the breach) to January 11, 2024. (Federici Decl., ¶ 13.) However,
the full amount of $53,225 was not owed on October 1, 2022, but only became due
after failing to also pay the rents owed on the subsequent months. (Memo
P&A p. 2:7-18, 3:20-4:7.) Thus, this interest calculation is incorrect.
 
Lastly, Plaintiff
substantiates the request for reasonable costs in the amount of $710.66, which
includes $435 in clerk’s filing fees, $209.85 in service of process fees, and
$65.81 in electronic filing fees. (Federici Decl., ¶ 3.)
 
The request for
entry of default judgment is denied.
