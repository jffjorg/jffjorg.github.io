And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendant. The plaintiff sought damages in the amount of $62,713.60, which includes interest, costs, and attorney fees. However, the amount sought exceeds the amount demanded in the complaint, which is $45,540.50. The judge cited California law and prior court cases to support the decision, stating that a default judgment cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint and that a default judgment is void if the required statement of damages was not served on the defendant before the default was taken. The judge also found that the plaintiff's calculation of interest and attorney fees was incorrect.
