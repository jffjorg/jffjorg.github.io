v. Bahari  
Case No.:                    22STCV39168
Motion:                       Motion
for Leave to Amend to File a Second Amended Complaint
Moving Party:             Plaintiff Morad Ben Neman and Lancaster Eagle, LLC

Opposing Party:          Defendants
Payam Bahari, Freydoon “Fred” Bahari Moghadam, Haim Bahari, Tal Bahari, 114
Grand Cypress, LLC, Cavalini, Inc., and Caster Modelo, LLC 

Tentative Ruling:      The
Motion for Leave to File the Second Amended Complaint is granted. Plaintiffs are
ordered to file the Second Amended Complaint on or before January 23, 2024.

             
            This case arises out of an alleged
breach of an oral joint venture agreement to purchase real estate. Plaintiffs
Morad Ben Neman and Lancaster Eagle, LLC (Plaintiffs) sued Defendants Payam
Bahari, Freydoon “Fred” Bahari Moghadam, Haim Bahari, Tal Bahari, and three
entities: (1) 114 Grand Cypress, LLC, (2) Cavalini, Inc., and (3) Caster
Modelo, LLC (collectively, Defendants).
 
            On December 16, 2022, Plaintiffs
filed a Complaint. Defendants demurred to each cause of action. The Court
sustained the demurrer in its entirety. 
 
            On June 9, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a
First Amended Complaint, alleging causes of action for (1.) Breach of Joint
Venture, (2.) Breach of Fiduciary Duty, (3.) Aiding and Abetting Breaches of
Fiduciary Duty, and (4.) Fraudulent Conveyances. 
 
Defendants again
demurred to the first, second, third, and fourth causes of action in the First
Amended Complaint. The Court sustained the demurrer in its entirety with leave
to amend. Plaintiffs were to file an amended pleading no later than December 1,
2023. Plaintiffs failed to comply with this Court order.
 
On December 13,
2023, the court clerk rejected Plaintiffs’ filing a Second Amended Company as
untimely. 
 
On January 2,
2024, Defendants filed an ex parte application to dismiss pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 581.[1]
 
Plaintiffs now
move for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint. Defendants oppose the
motion.
 
The Court grants
the motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint.  Plaintiffs shall file their second amended complaint
on or before January 23, 2024.
 
Legal
Standard
 
            The
court may, in furtherance of justice, allow a party to amend any pleading upon
any terms as may be proper.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 473, subd. (a), 576.)  Courts
liberally grant leave to amend based on a strong policy favoring resolution of
all disputes between parties in the same case. 
(Nestle v. Santa Monica (1972)
6 Cal.3d 920, 939; Morgan v. Superior
Court (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.) 
Thus, requests for leave to amend generally will be granted unless the
party seeking to amend has been dilatory in bringing the proposed amendment,
and the delay will cause prejudice to the opposing party if leave to amend is
permitted.  (Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490; see also Armenta
ex rel. City of Burbank (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 636, 642 [“instances
justifying the court’s denial of leave to amend are rare.”].)  Absent prejudice, delay alone is insufficient
to deny leave to amend.  (Higgins v. Del Faro (1981) 123
Cal.App.3d 558, 564-565.)
A party
requesting leave to amend must state what allegations in the previous pleading
are proposed to be deleted and added, as well as specify where, by page,
paragraph, and line number, the changes are located.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(a)(1)-(3).)
The moving party must also attach the proposed amended pleading with a
declaration by counsel, describing (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the
amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered; and (4) why the request was not made
earlier.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1324(b)(1)-(4).)  
Code
Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), provides, “The court may, upon
any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative
from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect....”
Analysis 
            
Plaintiffs
seek relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (a)(1)
and (b).
 
As
a preliminary matter, any relief sought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b), is premature. Specifically, there has been no “judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against” Plaintiff with respect to
Code of Civil Procedure section 581. 
 
The
Court will now address Plaintiffs’ reliance on Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (a)(1).
 
Although
Plaintiffs have attached the proposed pleading (Vivoli Decl., Ex. A), Defendants
are correct that Plaintiffs have failed to comply California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1324 showing the changes from the previous pleading. Specifically, Plaintiffs’
motion fails to identify which allegations are deleted and which were added to
the proposed Second Amended Complaint. 
 
Nonetheless,
given the procedural posture of this case and the Court’s prior decision to
allow leave to amend following its ruling on the demurrer to the First Amended
Complaint, Plaintiffs’ only defect here was the failure to timely file the
amended pleading by December 1, 2023. Under these circumstances, Plaintiffs’
failure to comply with the Rule of Court is not fatal. 
 
Also,
in opposition, Defendants argue that the amendments fail to adequately address
the issues raised in the previous demurrer and, therefore, continue to fail to
state a claim. The evaluation of these arguments are more appropriately addressed
on a demurrer than a motion for leave to amend. (See Kittredge Sports Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048 [“the better course of
action would have been to allow [plaintiff to amend the complaint and then let
the parties test its legal sufficiency in other appropriate
proceedings"].)
 
Notably
absent from Defendants’ opposition is any argument or evidence that they were
prejudiced by Plaintiffs’ delay of 10 days in filing the Second Amended
Complaint. 
 
The
motion is granted. 
 
Conclusion
 
              Accordingly,
the Court grants leave for Plaintiffs to file the Second Amended Complaint
attached to the Motion. Plaintiffs
are ordered to file their Second Amended Complaint on or before January 23,
2024.
