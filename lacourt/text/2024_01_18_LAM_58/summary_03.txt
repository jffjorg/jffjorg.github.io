```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint. The motion is granted because the Court's prior decision to allow leave to amend following its ruling on the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint, and the procedural posture of this case, justify the grant of the motion despite the failure to timely file the amended pleading. The Court also notes that the proposed Second Amended Complaint does not comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, but that this defect is not fatal under the circumstances. The judge orders the Plaintiffs to file their Second Amended Complaint on or before January 23, 2024.
