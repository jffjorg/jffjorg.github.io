Attorney General’s Act is granted.

 
Background
 
            Plaintiff Nancy Etemad, individually
and on behalf of other aggrieved employees, filed a class and representative
action complaint against Raymond James & Associates, Inc. (Defendant). The
Complaint alleges violations of the Labor Code for failure to pay minimum
wages, provide meal and rest periods, indemnify business expenses, timely pay
final wages upon termination, provide accurate wage statements and civil
penalties under the Private Attorney’s General Act of 2004 (PAGA).  
 
            On December
13, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion to approve a settlement under PAGA. The
Settlement Agreement defines “aggrieved employees” as “a person employed by Raymond James in California
and classified as a non-exempt employee who worked for Raymond James during the
PAGA Period.”  (Saunders Decl., Ex, 1
[PAGA Settlement Agreement], ¶ 1.4.) 
The “PAGA Period” is defined as from July 18, 2020 through the date of settlement approval. (Saunders Decl., Ex, 1, ¶ 1.20.) The breakdown of the settlement is as follows: 
 
Gross Settlement Amount:                                         $340,000.00  
Plaintiff’s Counsel’s Fees:                                          $113,333.33 (33%)
Plaintiff’s Counsel’s Litigation Costs:                       $10,028.42
Plaintiff’s Service Award:                                          $5,000.00  
Settlement Administration Costs:                               $3,990.00  
Net Settlement Amount (PAGA Penalties):               $207,548.25  
 
PAGA Penalties:                                                         $101,500.00
Labor Workforce Development Agency (75%):             $155,736.19
Aggrieved Employees (25%):                                    $51,912.06 
 
            Plaintiff seeks court approval of the
PAGA settlement.  
 
Legal Standard
 
            The Private Attorneys General Act is
“a procedural statute allowing an aggrieved employee to recover civil
penalties—for Labor Code violations—that otherwise would be sought by state
labor law enforcement agencies.”  (Amalgamated
Transit Union, Local 1756, AFL-CIO v. Superior Court (2009) 46 Cal.4th 993,
1003.)  The statute provides a mechanism
for private enforcement of Labor Code violations for the public benefit.  (See Arias v. Superior Court (2009) 46
Cal.4th 969, 986.) The statute incentivizes aggrieved employees by providing 25
percent of the recovered civil penalties, while the remaining 75 percent is
distributed to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) “for
enforcement of labor laws…and for education of employers and employees about
their rights and responsibilities under [the Labor Code].”  (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (i).)  
 
            “The superior court shall review and
approve any settlement of any civil action filed pursuant to this part [Labor
Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004].” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)

 
            “[A] trial court should evaluate a
PAGA settlement to determine whether it is fair, reasonable, and adequate in
view of PAGA’s purposes to remediate present labor law violations, deter future
ones, and to maximize enforcement of state labor laws.”  (Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021) 72
Cal.App.5th 56, 77.) A court should consider factors used in evaluating class
action settlements, such as the strength of the plaintiff’s case, the risk, the
stage of the proceeding, the complexity and likely duration of further
litigation, and the settlement amount. (Ibid.) Other factors that may be
useful in determining fairness include whether (1) the settlement is the result
of arm’s length bargaining, (2) investigation and discovery are sufficient to
allow counsel and the court to act intelligently, (3) counsel is experienced in
similar litigation, and (4) the percentage of objectors is small.  (Nordstrom Com. Cases (2010) 186
Cal.App.4th 576, 581; Wershba v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001) 91
Cal.App.4th 224, 245.)  In considering
the amount of settlement, the court is mindful that compromise is inherent and
necessary in the settlement process.  (Wershba,
supra, 91 Cal.App.4th at p. 250.) 
 
Discussion
 
Service on the Labor and Workforce Development Agency
 
            Plaintiff submitted an e-mail
confirmation that the proposed settlement was electronically submitted to the Labor
and Work Force Development Agency on December 13, 2023, in compliance with
Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (l)(2). (Saunders Decl., ¶ 27, Ex. 3.)
 
Fair, Reasonable & Adequate
 
            The Court finds the proposed
settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate to all concerned parties and is not
the product of fraud, collusion, or overreaching.
 
            Here, the parties attended a
full-day, private mediation, with Louis Marlin, Esq., an experienced mediator
with wage-and-hour class and representative actions. (Saunders Decl., ¶ 9.)  Prior to the mediation, the parties exchanged
informal discovery. (Saunders Decl., ¶ 8.) This included information on
policies, pay stubs, time records, and the number of potential aggrieved
employees and pay periods. (Saunders Decl., ¶ 9.) This satisfies the
requirement that the settlement was a result of arms-length bargaining.
 
            Plaintiff’s counsel also avers that
he thoroughly investigated the facts and risks associated with the case. He concedes
the risks with the case. (Saunders Decl., ¶¶ 19-26, 29-30.) Specifically,
Defendant, at all times, denied the claims. (Saunders Decl., ¶ 7.) Further,
Defendant raised several defenses to the meal and rest break claims. (Saunders
Decl., ¶ 20.) Defendant also raised a “good faith” defense with respect to wage
statement and waiting time penalty claims. (Saunders Decl., ¶ 23.) 
 
            Plaintiff also provides a detailed
breakdown of the potential exposure. Defendant estimated there were 198
employees affected during the PAGA period, constituting approximately 7,300 pay
periods. (Saunders Decl., ¶ 17.) Counsel multiplied this amount by the
statutory penalty of $100 per pay period, resulting in Defendants’ estimated
exposure of approximately $3,660,000 (Saunders Decl., ¶ 18.) Based on the risks of
establishing the case on the merits, the amount offered in settlement is
reasonable
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff’s counsel has conducted
adequate investigation and use of discovery.
 
Payment Procedures
 
            Within 30 days of the effective
date, Defendants shall pay the $340,000 with the Settlement Administrator. (Saunders
Decl., Ex. 1, ¶ 4.3.) Within 14 days of receiving the gross amount, the
Settlement Administrator will distribute the 25% of the PAGA fund to aggrieved
employees. (Saunders Decl., Ex. 1, ¶ 4.4.) Checks will be valid for 180 days
and any uncashed amount will be sent to the Unclaimed Property division of the
California State Controller’s office in the name of the aggrieved employee. (Saunders
Decl., Ex. 1, ¶¶ 4.4.1, 4.4.4)
 
            The Settlement Administrator will
issue IRS Form 1099s for each settlement payment.  (Saunders Decl., Ex. 1, ¶ 3.2.4.1.)
 
Experience of Counsel
 
            Saunders attests to his firm’s experience in class
actions and labor and employment cases.  (Saunders
Decl., ¶¶ 31-41.) Saunders also attests
that he has been involved in class action litigation since 2009. (Saunders
Decl., ¶¶ 32-33.)       
 
Attorney’s Fees and Litigation Costs
 
            Plaintiff requests $113,333.33in
attorney’s fees and $10,028.42 in costs.
 
            Labor Code section 2699, subdivision
(g)(1) provides “[a]ny employee who prevails in any action shall be entitled to
an award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs . . . .” (Lab. Code, §
2699(g)(1).)
 
            The Court finds that Plaintiff is
represented by experienced counsel and that the requested attorney fee award is
fair, adequate, and reasonable. The fee requested, $113,333.33, represents one-third
of the gross settlement, an amount routinely awarded in California courts in
class and PAGA actions. (Chavez v. Netflix, Inc. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th
43, 66, fn. 11.) None of the parties have objected to this amount. The Court
finds that $113,333.33 in attorney’s fees is appropriate.
 
            As to costs, Plaintiff provides an
itemized statement. (Saunders Decl., ¶ 49.) The total incurred was $10,028.42,
of which the bulk was the mediation fee ($9,000). The Settlement Agreement
indicates that the parties agreed to cap the costs at $15,000.00. (Saunders
Decl., Ex. 1, ¶¶ 3.2.1.)
 
            Given the estimated realistic
exposure amount, the Court finds the $340,000 offered in settlement is fair,
adequate, and reasonable. The distribution of the net settlement also complies
with Labor Code section 2699(i), which requires 75 percent of the amount to be
paid to the LWDA and 25 percent of the amount to be paid to the aggrieved
employees.
 
Plaintiff’s Service Award
 
            Plaintiff requests $5,000 as a
service award for her time and effort exerted on behalf of the aggrieved
employees. (Etemad Decl., ¶ 8.) She asserts that she has been actively involved
in the case by engaging in regular communication with the attorneys by
discussing litigation strategy, witnesses, and updates. (Etemad Decl., ¶ 7.) The
Court finds that this amount is reasonable in exchange for a general release of
claims. 
 
Settlement Administration Costs
 
            The parties have agreed to engage Apex
Class Action LLC (Apex) as the third-party settlement administrator and
requests court approval of $3,990.00 for administration costs.  (Saunders Decl., Ex. 1, ¶ 3.2.3.) Apex will conduct
data analysis, perform skip-tracing as necessary, calculate and disburse
payments, provide tax reporting, re-issue checks, and perform other
administrative tasks. (Saunders Decl., Ex. 1, ¶¶ 4.4, 7.)
 
            Sean Hartranft, the Chief Executive
Officer at Apex, submits a declaration as to the qualifications of Apex. He
asserts that Apex “has been directly involved with settlement administration
for a combined 15 years and has successfully managed numerous class & PAGA
actions during that time.” (Hartranft Decl., ¶ 2.) In addition, Apex asserts
that “has implemented a comprehensive process to identify, assess, and mitigate
risks in all areas of its operations, regularly evaluating the effectiveness of
its security measures” and, additionally, “[a]ccess to aggrieved employee
information is limited to employees, agents, or subcontractors who require it
to perform their duties, and Apex Class Action conducts background checks on
all personnel with access to sensitive personal information, to ensure they do
not pose a threat to the security of client or aggrieved employee information.”
(Hartranft Decl., ¶ 5.) Lastly, Apex maintains Professional Liability and Cyber
Liability Insurance coverage, which would provide protection in the event of a
data breach or misappropriation. (Hartranft Decl., ¶ 5.)
 
            Plaintiff submits Apex’s bid for
settlement administration, reflecting the $4,990 in costs, which are capped at
$3,990.00.  The bid contains an itemized
statement of the various tasks that Apex will undertake. The Court approves the
requested $3,990.00.
 
Release
 
            The Court finds the release under
the Settlement Agreement is fair and reasonable. 
 
The release states: “Plaintiff and the Settlement Aggrieved
Employees shall be deemed to have, and by operation of the final judgment
approved by the Court, shall have, fully, finally, and forever settled and
released all legal claims and factual or legal theories/allegations that were
alleged in the operative complaint in the Action, including but not limited to,
all of the following claims for civil penalties under PAGA for: (a) failure to
pay all wages owed, including as a result of miscalculation of applicable rates
of pay; (b) failure to authorize and permit meal periods; (c) failure to
authorize and permit rest periods; (d) failure to furnish accurate itemized
wage statements; (e) failure to maintain accurate, itemized payroll records;
(f) failure to pay all wages earned and unpaid at separation; (g) failure to
pay wages timely during employment; (h) refusal to pay wages pursuant to Labor
Code section 216; (i) payment of secret lower wage rate pursuant to Section
223; (j) failure to reimburse necessary business expenses; (k) unlawful
background checks pursuant to Labor Code sections 1024.5, 432.5, and 432.7. The
period of the Release shall extend to the date that the Court enters the order
granting approval of the settlement or 60 days from July 6, 2023, whichever
occurs sooner. The res judicata effect of the Judgment will be the same as that
of the Release.” (Saunders Decl., Ex. 1, ¶ 5.) 

            
Conclusion 
 
            The motion to approve settlement of
claims brought under the Private Attorneys General Act is granted.
