Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Samira Saha's motion to compel Defendant Rickey L. Colley, Jr. to respond to post-judgment demands for identification and production of documents (RPDs, Set One). The judge finds that the deadline for responses or objections to RPDs, Set One, has expired, and that no responses or objections were served by Defendant Colley, Jr. The judge also determines that the production requests are within the scope of discovery because they relate to information that may lead to the discovery of evidence regarding Defendant Colley, Jr.'s ability to pay the judgment against him in this action.

Additionally, the judge grants Plaintiff Saha's motion for sanctions in the sum of $612.50 against Defendant Colley, Jr. The judge finds that Defendant Colley, Jr.'s failure to respond to RPDs, Set One, is a discovery abuse that warrants monetary sanctions. The judge orders Defendant Colley, Jr. to remit payment of $618.50 to Plaintiff Saha within 30 days of service of notice of this ruling.
