  Demand for Identification and Production of Documents and for Sanctions in
  the Sum of $612.50.



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
On June 20, 2016, Plaintiff Samira
Saha sued Defendants Rickey L. Colley, Jr., and Does 1-20 pursuant to a
Complaint alleging claims of (1) Fraud, (2) Negligent Misrepresentation, (3)
Breach of Oral Contract, (4) Promissory Estoppel, (5) Conversion, (6) Battery,
(7) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, (8) Common Count – Money Lent,
and (9) Common Count – Account Stated.
B. Default Judgment
On October 30, 2016, the Clerk
filed an entry of default against Defendant Colley, Jr., as requested by
Plaintiff Saha.
On December 23, 2016, in relation
to a hearing regarding default judgment set for January 26, 2017, the Court granted
default judgment against Defendant Colley, Jr.
On June 16, 2017, the Court signed judgment
in this action.
That same day, the Clerk served
notice of entry of judgment.
C. Motion Before the Court
On November 21, 2023, Plaintiff
Saha served a first set of post-judgment demands for the identification and
production of documents (RPDs, Set One) on Defendant Colley, Jr., via U.S.
First Class Mail to Colley, Jr.’s Los Angeles, California, and Beverly Hills,
California addresses.
On February 29, 2024, Plaintiff Saha
filed a motion to compel initial discovery responses to RPDs, Set One, and for
sanctions against Defendant Colley, Jr.
The motion was served on Defendant
Colley, Jr., himself by service at his Beverly Hills, California address by
overnight/express mail and by email service at Defendant Colley, Jr.’s Gmail
email address.
No opposition appears in the
record, nor does a reply or notice of non-opposition.
Plaintiff Saha’s motion is now
before the Court.
 
II. Motion to Compel Responses to Production Requests and
for Sanctions
A. Motion to Compel Initial
Responses
1. Legal
Standard
The provisions in California Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.010 et seq. apply to the enforcement of
requests for production served in a civil action by a judgment creditor on a
judgment debtor and which seek information that will aid in the enforcement of
the money judgment.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 708.030, subd. (a).)
A motion to compel an initial
response can be made on the ground that a party did not serve a timely response
to interrogatories or a demand to produce. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(a); see Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404 (Sinaiko).) To establish this ground, a
movant must show:
(1) Proper service (see Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.040);
(2) Expiration of the deadline for
the initial response 30 days after service or on date agreed to by parties (see
Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subds. (a), (b)); and
(3) No timely response (see Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300).
A court must deny a motion to
compel initial discovery where the discovery sought is outside the scope of
discovery. (See CBS, Inc. v. Superior Court (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12,
19; see also Code. Civ. Proc., § 2017.010 [scope of discovery].) 
2. Analysis

Here, the Court finds sufficient
grounds to grant Plaintiff Saha’s motion.
First, Plaintiff Saha presents
evidence showing service of RPDs, Set One, on Defendant Colley, Jr. on November
21, 2023, via U.S. First Class Mail. (Mot., Jen Decl., ¶ 3 and Exhibit A.)
Second, Plaintiff Saha presents
evidence that the deadline for responses or objections to RPDs, Set One, has
expired, and that no responses or objections thereto were served by Defendant
Colley, Jr. (Mot., Jen Decl., ¶¶ 1-7.)
Last, the Court determines that the
production requests are within the scope of discovery because they relate to
information that may lead to the discovery of evidence regarding Defendant
Colley, Jr’s ability to pay the judgment against him in this action. (See Mot.,
Ex. A.)
Plaintiff Saha’s motion is thus
GRANTED as to compelling initial responses to RPDs, Set One.
The Court notes that objections to
RPDs, Set One, have been waived. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
B. Request for Sanctions
1. Legal
Standard
The provisions in California Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.010 et seq. apply to the enforcement of
requests for production served in a civil action by a judgment creditor on a
judgment debtor and which seek information that will aid in the enforcement of
the money judgment.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 708.030, subd. (a).)
The Court must impose monetary
sanctions against anyone—party, nonparty, or attorney—who unsuccessfully makes
or opposes the motion, unless it finds that the person to be sanctioned acted
with substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanctions unjust. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c); see Sinaiko,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 404.)
The court may award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery,
even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion
was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party
after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
2. Analysis
Here, the Court finds sufficient
grounds to grant Plaintiff Saha’s motion for monetary sanctions.
First, a failure to respond to an
authorized method of discovery, e.g., production requests, is a discovery abuse
that can serve as a basis for monetary sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2023.010, subd. (d), 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Second, here, the nonresponse
described in Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration shows such a failure to respond
to RPDs, Set One, an authorized method of discovery. (Mot., Jen Decl., ¶¶ 1-7; Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 708.030, 2031.300.)
Third, Defendant Colley’s failure
to oppose this motion does not undercut this Court’s ability to impose
sanctions. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
Last, the Court determines that
sanctions of $612.50 are reasonable, as comprised of a reasonable fee rate of
$425 per hour, 1.3 hours spent preparing this motion, and a $60 motion filing
fee. (Mot., Jen Decl., ¶¶ 8-9.)
Sanctions are thus GRANTED in the
amount of $612.50. 
V. Conclusion

Plaintiff/Judgment Creditor Samira
Saha’s Motion to Compel Discovery Responses to Post-Judgment Demand for
Identification and Production of Documents is GRANTED.
Defendant Rickey L. Colley, Jr. is
ORDERED to produce documents, information, or explanations of non-availability
in relation to RPDs, Set One, without objection (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a)), within 30 days of service of this ruling.
B. Sanctions
Plaintiff/Judgment Creditor Samira
Saha’s Motion for Sanctions in the Sum of $612.50 is GRANTED.
Defendant Rickey L. Colley, Jr. is
ORDERED to remit payment of $618.50 to Plaintiff/Judgment Creditor Samira Saha within
30 days of service of notice of this ruling.
