Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion filed by Defendant Kaneka North America LLC (Doe 7) for a determination of good faith settlement in relation to a settlement reached between Plaintiff Gresham Lombard and Defendant Kaneka. The settlement involves a payment of $10,000.00 to Plaintiff Lombard's attorney, with no other persons entitled to receive payment. The Judge finds that the settlement appears to be in good faith, based on the Tech-Bilt factors, and tentatively grants the motion on the condition that proof of proper service on all parties is provided. If service is confirmed, all other joint tortfeasors or co-obligors of Defendant Kaneka shall be barred from any further claims against Defendant Kaneka for equitable comparative contribution or partial or comparative indemnity.
