**Tentative Ruling Summary**

The Court has tentatively ruled in favor of the Plaintiff, Compound Development LLC, and against the Defendants, Jay William Smith and David M. Robinson. The Court has overruled the demurrer filed by the Defendants and ordered them to file and serve their answers to the Plaintiff's complaint within 30 days of the hearing date.

The Court found that the Plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to support each element of a cause of action for Fraud, Negligent Misrepresentation, Unfair Business Practices, and Breach of Fiduciary Duty against the Defendants. The Court rejected the Defendants' argument that the Plaintiff was apprised of David M. Robinson's bar status through the purported retainer agreement and found that there exists a factual dispute that is improper for resolution at the demurrer stage.
