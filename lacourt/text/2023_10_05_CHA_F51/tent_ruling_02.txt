Los Angeles Superior Court Case
# 23CHCV01483

¿ 
Demurrer Filed: 7/6/23
¿ 
MOVING PARTY: Defendants Jay William Smith; and David
M. Robinson (collectively, “Defendants”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
Compound Development LLC (“Plaintiff”) 
NOTICE: OK
¿ 
RELIEF REQUESTED: Defendants
demur to Plaintiff’s entire complaint.
¿ 
TENTATIVE RULING: The demurrer is overruled. Defendants are ordered to file and
serve their answers to Plaintiff’s complaint within 30 days of this hearing
date.
 
BACKGROUND¿ 
 
Plaintiff
alleges that on 12/7/22, it entered into a legal services agreement with
Defendant Jay William Smith to represent Plaintiff in Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 19STCV08264. (Compl. ¶ 5.) Plaintiff alleges that all
communications regarding the retainer and legal representation were conducted
between Plaintiff and Defendant David M. Robinson, and the retainer fee was
paid to Robinson’s personal account. (Id. at ¶¶ 6–8.) Plaintiff alleges
that neither Defendant “notified Plaintiff in writing or verbally that ROBINSON
is a disbarred attorney from April 14, 2011 at any time.” (Id. at ¶ 9.)
 
Plaintiff
alleges that it learned that 11 Motions to Compel Discovery had been filed
against it in LASC Case No. 19STCV08264 due to Defendants’ failure to respond
to discovery requests on behalf of Plaintiff. (Id. at ¶¶ 12–14.) “Plaintiff
has been harmed in amounts of $7,500.00 in legal fees paid, plus interest at 7%
per annum, plus another $30,000.00 in legal fees to retain new counsel with the
need to expedite file review in 19STCV08264 where 11 motions to compel are
still on calendar that need to be opposed as well as the discovery requests
answered, plus punitive damages in the amount of $100,000.00 for the purposeful
and malicious act of concealing the fact that the de facto individual
performing 95% of the representation of Plaintiff, ROBINSON, is a disbarred
attorney whom is forbidden to be the sole client contact, to give legal advice,
and to accept legal fees directly into their own personal account.” (Id.
at ¶ 15.)
 
On 5/22/23,
Plaintiff filed its complaint, alleging against Defendants the following causes
of action: (1) Fraud; (2) Violation of Business & Professions Code § 17200;
(3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty; and (4) Negligent Misrepresentation.
 
On 7/6/23, Defendants
filed the instant demurrer. On 7/26/23, Plaintiff filed its opposition. On 9/27/23,
Defendants filed their reply.
 
ANALYSIS
 
As a general matter, a party may respond to a pleading
against it by demurrer based on any single or combination of eight enumerated
grounds, including that “the pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) In a
demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿However, a “court cannot by means of judicial notice
convert a demurrer into an incomplete evidentiary hearing in which the
demurring party can present documentary evidence and the opposing party is
bound by what that evidence appears to show.” (Fremont Indemnity Co. v.
Fremont General Corp., 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 114–115.)
 
“A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence
or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs.
(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the
complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The
only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands,
states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.) 
 
Here,
Defendants demur to Plaintiff’s entire complaint, arguing that Plaintiff fails
to state facts sufficient to constitute any of the causes of action therein.
 
A.    Meet
and Confer
 
Before filing its demurrer, “the demurring party shall meet
and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that
is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can
be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41, subd. (a).) The demurring party must file and
serve a meet and confer declaration stating either: “(A) The means by which the
demurring party met and conferred with the party who filed the pleading subject
to demurrer, and that the parties did not reach an agreement resolving the
objections raised in the demurrer;” or “(B) That the party who filed the
pleading subject to demurrer failed to respond to the meet and confer request
of the demurring party or otherwise failed to meet and confer in good faith.” (Id.
at subd. (a)(3).)
 
Here, Defendants’ counsel declares that he emailed Plaintiff’s
counsel to meet and confer regarding the issues raised in the instant demurrer
but received no response. (Decl. of Jay W. Smith ¶ 2.) Therefore, the Court
finds that counsel has satisfied the preliminary meet and confer
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a).
//
//
B.     Fraud;
Negligent Misrepresentation
 
Plaintiff’s
first and fourth causes of action respectively allege Fraud and Negligent
Misrepresentation against Defendants. “One who willfully deceives another with
intent to induce him to alter his position to his injury or risk, is liable for
any damage which he thereby suffers.” (Civ. Code § 1709.) The elements that
must be pleaded in a cause of action for fraud are: (1) a misrepresentation
(false representation, concealment or nondisclosure); (2) knowledge of its
falsity (or “scienter”); (3) intent to defraud (i.e., to induce reliance); (4)
justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting damage. (Philipson & Simon v.
Gulsvig (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 347, 363.)
 
The elements of a cause of action for negligent
misrepresentation include “[m]isrepresentation of a past or existing
material fact, without reasonable ground for believing it to be true, and with
intent to induce another’s reliance on the fact misrepresented; ignorance of
the truth and justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation by the party to whom
it was directed; and resulting damage.” (Hydro-Mill
Co., Inc. v. Hayward, Tilton & Rolapp Ins. Associates, Inc. (2004) 115
Cal.App.4th 1145, 1154 [quotations omitted].)
 
Fairness
requires that allegations of fraud be pled “with particularity” so that the
court can weed out nonmeritorious actions before a defendant is required to
answer. (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184.) The
particularity requirement necessitates pleading facts that “show how, when,
where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.” (Lazar
v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.)
 
Here,
Plaintiff alleges that although Defendants knew that Robinson had been
disbarred from practicing law since 2011 for conversion of client funds, they “concealed
this crucial information to induce Plaintiff into agreeing to be represented by
Defendants and for ROBINSON to be directly paid for legal representation
services thinking that he was being represented by legal, licensed
professionals.” (Compl. ¶¶ 17, 19, 22.) Plaintiff further alleges that
Defendants made continued misrepresentations that Robinson was a licensed
attorney, and further misrepresented they did not receive the 11 sets of
discovery in LASC Case No. 19STCV08264, ultimately causing Plaintiff monetary
damages for legal services paid to Defendants and to retain new counsel. (Id.
at ¶¶ 24–26.)
 
Defendants
argue that here, “there was no misrepresentation nor was there a concealment of
a material fact as Mr. Smith advised Compound of Mr. Robinson’s bar status, in
writing in the retainer agreement provided to Compound and acknowledged by
Compound.” (Dem. 8:3–5.) “In that retainer agreement, it is specifically stated
that The Law Offices of Jay W. Smith employs ‘non-licensed attorneys,
including, but not limited to, David Robinson.’” (Id. at 7:3–5.) The
Court notes that Defendants attach a copy of the purported retainer agreement
to the Declaration of Defendant/Counsel Jay W. Smith, and not in a request for
judicial notice, as is proper. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(l).)
 
Notwithstanding
the foregoing, even if the purported agreement were accepted by the Court as
judicially noticeable, a demurrer hearing “may not be turned into a contested
evidentiary hearing through the guise of having the court take judicial notice
of documents whose truthfulness or proper interpretation are disputable.” (Joslin
v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374.) “Judicial notice
of matters upon demurrer will be dispositive only in those instances where
there is not or cannot be a factual dispute concerning that which is sought to
be judicially noticed.” (Cruz v. County of Los Angeles (1985) 173
Cal.App.3d 1131, 1134.)
 
Here,
Plaintiff has alleged in its complaint that “neither ROBINSON nor SMITH
notified Plaintiff in writing or verbally that ROBINSON is a disbarred attorney
from April 14, 2011 at any time.” (Compl. ¶ 9.) Assuming this factual
allegation as true, along with the existence of the purported retainer
agreement, the Court therefore finds that there exists a factual dispute that
is improper for resolution at the demurrer stage.
 
Based on
the foregoing, the Court is satisfied at the demurrer stage that Plaintiff has
alleged facts sufficient to support its causes of action for Fraud and
Negligent Misrepresentation. Accordingly, the demurrer is overruled as to
Plaintiff’s first and fourth causes of action.
 
C.    Unfair
Business Practices
 
Plaintiff’s
second cause of action alleges that Defendants violated Business and
Professions Code section 17200 et seq. (the “UCL”). To set forth a claim for
unfair business practices in violation of the UCL, a plaintiff must establish
that the defendant was engaged in an “unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business
act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising” and
certain specific acts. (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200.) 
 
“In
essence, an action based on Business and Professions Code section 17200 to
redress an unlawful business practice ‘borrows’ violations of other laws and
treats these violations, when committed pursuant to business activity, as
unlawful practices independently actionable under section 17200 et seq. and
subject to the distinct remedies provided thereunder.” (People ex rel. Bill
Lockyer v. Fremont Life Ins. Co. (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 508, 515.) A
plaintiff alleging an “unfair” business practice under the UCL must show that
the defendant's conduct is “tethered to an underlying constitutional, statutory
or regulatory provision, or that it threatens an incipient violation of an
antitrust law or violates the policy or spirit of an antitrust law.” (Graham
v. Bank of America, N.A. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 594, 613.) “‘Fraudulent,’
as used in the statute, does not refer to the common law tort of fraud but only
requires a showing members of the public ‘are likely to be deceived.’” (Olsen
v. Breeze, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 608, 618.)
 
Here,
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants’ conduct in concealing/misrepresenting the
fact that Robinson was disbarred for conversion of client funds amounts to
unlawful, unfair, and fraudulent business practices in violation of the UCL.
(Compl. ¶ 29.) In their demurrer, Defendants reassert their argument that
Plaintiff was apprised of Robinson’s bar status, based on the purported
retainer agreement, and therefore cannot allege that Defendants engaged in
fraudulent business practices. (Dem. 8:18–24.) As set forth above, the Court
rejects this argument. Accordingly, the demurrer to Plaintiff’s second cause of
action is overruled.
//

D.    Breach
of Fiduciary Duty
 
Plaintiff’s
third cause of action alleges Breach of Fiduciary Duty against Smith. “The
elements of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty are the existence of
a fiduciary relationship, breach of fiduciary duty, and damages.” (Oasis
West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 820.) “An attorney owes
all clients … duties of undivided loyalty and diligence, among other fiduciary
duties.” (White Mountains Reins. Co. of America v. Borton Petrini, LLP
(2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 890, 902.)
 
Here,
Plaintiff alleges that a fiduciary relationship between Plaintiff and Smith was
created when Plaintiff retained Smith as its legal representation in LASC Case
No. 19STCV08264, that Smith breached this relationship through his various
alleged misrepresentations and caused Plaintiff the above-mentioned monetary
harm. (Compl. ¶¶ 34–39.)
 
Defendants
argue that the facts alleged in this cause of action more appropriately
constitute a cause of action for professional negligence/legal malpractice,
which fails because Plaintiff cannot allege that “it conclusively lost any
primary right or any other detrimental result that can be attributed to any act
or omission alleged against Defendants.” (Dem. 10:12–14.) Defendants further
argue that “any contract or agreement that Compound had was with The Law
Offices of Jay W. Smith, not David Robinson, and therefore, David Robinson is
not a proper Defendant to a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.” (Id.
at 11:11–13.)
 
As a
preliminary matter, “a breach of fiduciary duty is a species of tort distinct
from a cause of action for professional negligence.” (Stanley v. Richmond
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1070, 1086.) Furthermore, this cause of action is alleged
against defendant Smith only, and therefore the Court declines to reach the
merits of the parties’ arguments concerning the applicability of this cause of
action against defendant Robinson.
 
Based on
the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff has alleged facts sufficient to support
each element of a cause of action for Breach of Fiduciary Duty against Smith.
Accordingly, the demurrer is overruled as to Plaintiff’s third cause of action.
 
CONCLUSION¿ 
 
The demurrer is
overruled. Defendants are ordered to file and serve their answers to
Plaintiff’s complaint within 30 days of this hearing date.
