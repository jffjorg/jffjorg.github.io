And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's unopposed motion for an order nunc pro tunc, which seeks to have the plaintiff's Summons and Complaint deemed filed as of February 22, 2023. The plaintiff's Complaint was initially rejected by the court due to technical issues, but the plaintiff argues that the clerk improperly rejected the filing. The judge has noted that the plaintiff's complaint was submitted for filing before the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and was seemingly rejected for technical reasons due to a clerical error, not a legal deficiency in the complaint. The judge has cited several cases, including Rojas v. Cutsforth, Dillon v. Superior Court of Nevada County, and Carlson v. State of California Department of Fish & Game, to support the granting of the motion. The judge has also reminded the parties that they must comply with the technical requirements for e-filing documents, as set forth in the court's General Order.
