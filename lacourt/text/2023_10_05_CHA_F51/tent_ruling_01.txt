MOTION FOR AN
ORDER NUNC PRO TUNC

Los Angeles Superior Court Case
# 23CHCV00608

  
Motion Filed: 7/10/23
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Vartan Minassian (“Plaintiff”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendants Levon Ayrapetov;
Jessica Ayrapetov; William Josephson; and Catherine Flannery (collectively,
“Defendants”)
NOTICE: OK
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order nunc pro tunc overturning
the rejection of Plaintiff’s Summons and Complaint and accepting the filing
thereof as of the original 2/22/23 filing date.
 
TENTATIVE RULING: The unopposed motion is granted.
 
Plaintiff is reminded to review the 5/3/19 First Amended
General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil. When e-filing
documents, parties must comply with the “TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS” which are set
forth at page 4, line 4 through page 5, line 12 of the Court’s 5/3/19 First
Amended General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil (particularly
bookmarking declarations and exhibits). (CRC 3.1110(f)(4).) Failure to comply
with these requirements in the future may result in papers being rejected,
matters being placed off calendar, matters being continued so documents can be
resubmitted in compliance with these requirements, documents not being
considered and/or the imposition of sanctions.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a personal injury action in
which Plaintiff alleges that on 2/23/21, Plaintiff was walking his dog near
Defendants’ residence when he was attacked by two of Defendants’ dogs. (Compl. ¶¶ 11–12.)
 
On 2/22/23, at 5:14 PM, Plaintiff attempted
to file his Complaint, alleging against Defendants the following causes of
action: (1) Strict Liability; and (2) Negligence. (Decl. of George K. Jawlakian
¶ 3, Ex. 1 to Mot.)

 
On 2/24/23, at 3:19 PM, the Court
generated a Notice of Court Rejection of Electronic Filing, citing the reason
for the rejection as follows: “The Defendants name on Summons must match
exactly as stated in EFM and Complaint. Incomplete Summons, missing plaintiff's
attorney telephone number and zlso [sic] in EFM.’” (Ex. 2 to Mot.) On 3/1/23,
at 9:50 AM, the Court again rejected the filing for the following reasons: “Incorrect
case category and/or case type selected … In eFile - "Type of Action"
must correspond verbatim with your selection on the Civil Case Cover Sheet
Addendum & Statement of Location...please verify and correct.” (Ibid.)
 
On 3/2/23, at 2:14 PM, Plaintiff
successfully re-filed his Complaint with the Court. On 7/10/23, Plaintiffs
filed the instant motion for an order nunc pro tunc deeming the Summons and
Complaint as filed on 2/22/23. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff argues that the Court
clerk improperly rejected the filing after the two-year statute of limitations
expired. In Rojas v. Cutsforth (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 774, the plaintiff
in a personal injury action had mailed the complaint to the superior court
clerk for filing within the statutory period; however, the clerk returned the
unfiled complaint by mail because the declaration for court assignment was not
signed, and the summons contained the address of the wrong branch of the court.
In the meantime, the statute of limitations passed. The trial court denied
plaintiff's request for a nunc pro tunc filing of the complaint and granted
summary judgment for the defendant on the ground that the plaintiff’s action
was barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The Court of Appeal
reversed the judgment with instructions to deem the complaint filed when it was
first presented. The court held that the clerk had no proper basis for
rejecting plaintiff's complaint; thus, it was deemed filed on the date that it
was first deposited with the clerk. (See also Dillon v. Superior Court of
Nevada County (1914) 24 Cal.App. 760, 765–766 [a paper is deemed filed when
deposited with the clerk with directions to file the paper]; Carlson v.
State of California Department of Fish & Game (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th
1268.)
 
Here, Plaintiff’s complaint was
submitted for filing before the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations and was seemingly rejected for technical reasons due to a clerical
error, not a legal deficiency in the complaint. Therefore, the Court grants the
instant motion, and orders Plaintiff’s Summons and Complaint to be deemed filed
as of 2/22/23.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The unopposed motion is granted.
