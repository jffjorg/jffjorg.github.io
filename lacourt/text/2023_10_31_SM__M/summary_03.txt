Summary:

The tentative ruling grants a preliminary injunction to prevent the sale of the property at a trustee's sale. The court finds that the notice of default is invalid and that the sale of the property would be illegal. The court also finds that Jayco waived its rights to call up the loan and that the property should not be foreclosed until a proper demand is made by the beneficiary. The court orders Jayco to pay $62,078.58 as a bond to compensate for any damages sustained by Jayco due to the injunction.
