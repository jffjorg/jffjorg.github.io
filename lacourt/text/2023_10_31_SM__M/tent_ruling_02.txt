Legal
Standard
 
            A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (CCP §§
430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate
facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim
against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie
(1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading,
or the construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore Land Co. v. Petersen
(1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations omitted.)
 
            A
special demurrer for uncertainty is disfavored and will only be sustained where
the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot
reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or
claims are directed against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s
of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if
the pleading is somewhat vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern
discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)

 
            “Liberality in permitting amendment
is the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to
show in what manner plaintiff can amend the complaint,
and how that amendment will change the legal effect of the
pleading. (Id.)
 
Analysis
 
Defendant Ebi Nikjoo, D.D.S., demurs to the sole cause of action for
unlawful detainer on the grounds that the Three Day Notice to Pay or
Quit is defective.
 
Defendant argues that, under Code of Civil Procedure section 1161(2), the
notice is invalid.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1161(2) provides in relevant part:
 
“When [the defendant] continues in
possession, in person or by subtenant, without the permission of his or her
landlord, or the successor in estate of his or her landlord, if applicable,
after default in the payment of rent, pursuant to the lease or agreement under
which the property is held, and three days’ notice, in writing, requiring its
payment, stating the amount that is due, the name, telephone number, and
address of the person to whom the rent payment shall be made, and, if
payment may be made personally, the usual days and hours that person will be
available to receive the payment (provided that, if the address does not
allow for personal delivery, then it shall be conclusively presumed that upon
the mailing of any rent or notice to the owner by the tenant to the name and
address provided, the notice or rent is deemed received by the owner on the
date posted, if the tenant can show proof of mailing to the name and address
provided by the owner), or the number of an account in a financial institution into
which the rental payment may be made, and the name and street address of the
institution (provided that the institution is located within five miles of the
rental property), or if an electronic funds transfer procedure has been
previously established, that payment may be made pursuant to that procedure, or
possession of the property, shall have been served upon the tenant…
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
The statutory requirements in unlawful detainer proceedings must be
strictly complied with. (WDT-Winchester v. Nilsson (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th
516, 526.)  Defendant argues that
the Three-Day Notice to Pay or Quit at issue does not indicate whether the
payments would be made personally, by mail, or by an established electronic
transfer. (Compl., Ex. 4.) Defendant contends that the notice is invalid
because it only indicates to whom the payment must be made, and by when, but it
does not indicate whether it is demanding payment personally during said
periods of time, or by mail. However, based on a strict construction of the
statutory language, the three-day notice does not need to indicate that the
payment be made personally during or by mail. In fact, a landlord may not limit
payment to one form. (See CCP § 1947.3(a).) Further, the notice includes the
information for personal delivery, i.e., that the agent was available Monday
through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the indicated address. Therefore, the Court finds that the
Three-Day Notice sufficiently identifies the information required in conformity
with section 1161(2).  
 
Defendant argues that the three-day notice demands
payment in the estimated amount of $52,517.51, but fails to indicate how much
accrued for each month, and does not indicate if the rent is due on the 15th as
opposed to the 1st of the month. Defendant reasons that the demand exceeds one
year because the lease provides for rent of $49,087.20 annually (see Ex. 3 Pg.
54), while the holdover damages pled amounts to $52,149.60 annually. There is
no authority indicating that the three-day notice must state the individual
months of accrual. Further, in commercial tenancies under section 1161.1, the landlord may reasonably estimate the rent
due within the prior year. Further, an otherwise proper notice under section
1161.1 is not invalidated simply because it includes a demand for rent due for
more than a year. (Levitz Furniture Co. of the Pac., Inc. v. Wingtip
Communications, Inc., (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1035, 1042-1043.) 
 
Here,
on March 30, 2023, Plaintiff caused to be served a Three-Day Notice to
Pay Rent or Quit stating the amount of base rent and charges due for the
preceding 12 months in the estimated sum of $52,517.51 pursuant to the Lease
and CCP section 1161.1. (Compl., ¶ 13, Ex. 4.) As such, any perceived
discrepancy with the rent demand would not invalidate the three-day notice
under section 1161.1.  Accordingly, the
demurrer is OVERRULED.
