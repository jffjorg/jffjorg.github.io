And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the demurrer filed by defendant Ebi Nikjoo, D.D.S., to the first amended complaint filed by plaintiff WW Westwood LP. The demurrer argues that the three-day notice to pay rent or quit is defective because it does not indicate how much accrued for each month and does not indicate if the rent is due on the 15th or 1st of the month. However, the court finds that the notice substantially complies with the statutory requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1161(2) and does not need to indicate whether payment will be made personally or by mail. Furthermore, the notice includes the information for personal delivery, and the court finds that the rent demand is reasonable. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled, and the complaint will proceed.
