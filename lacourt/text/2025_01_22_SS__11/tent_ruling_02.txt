TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant’s motion in limine no. 1 is denied without prejudice to
Defendant making specific objections to specific testimony at trial.
 
BACKGROUND
 
“This is a class action. . . . 
Plaintiff alleges that Cedars-Sinai charges an undisclosed fee – the ER
Visitation Fee – for seeking treatment at Cedars-Sinai’s emergency room.”  (2/14/23 Tentative Ruling Re: Motion for
Class Certification, p. 1.)
 
Here, Cedars-Sinai moves to “preclude[e] Plaintiff . . . from  testifying about her interpretation of any
term within the Conditions of Admissions agreement” (“COA”).  (Motion, p. 2, italics in original.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
The premise of Defendant’s motion is that Plaintiff should be barred from
providing interpretation testimony because she lacks personal knowledge because
she did not read the COA before signing it. 
(See Motion, pp. 3-4.)
 
The Court disagrees.  In the cited
testimony, Plaintiff states that she “can’t remember” whether she read before
signing.  (Id. at p. 3.)  Not remembering is different than
affirming.  Moreover, as the opposition
brief demonstrates, Plaintiff further testified that she was “sure” that,
pre-signing, she read paragraph 11 and “skimmed through the whole document.”  (Opposition, p. 2; see also id. at p. 3
[testifying that “I’m sure I read through the whole thing”].)
 
Accordingly, the Court denies the motion in limine but grants Defendant
leave to make specific objections to specific testimony at trial.[1]
