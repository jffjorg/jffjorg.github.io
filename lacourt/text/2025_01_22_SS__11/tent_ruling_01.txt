TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant’s motion in limine no. 5 is denied without prejudice to
Defendant making specific objections to specific testimony and evidence at
trial.
 
BACKGROUND
 
“This is a class action. . . . 
Plaintiff alleges that Cedars-Sinai charges an undisclosed fee – the ER
Visitation Fee – for seeking treatment at Cedars-Sinai’s emergency room.”  (2/14/23 Tentative Ruling Re: Motion for
Class Certification, p. 1.)
 
Here, Cedars-Sinai seeks “an order precluding Plaintiff . . . from
testifying/offering any evidence about the definition, nature and/or purpose of
‘EMS Fees[.]’”  (Motion, p. 2.)[1]
 
DISCUSSION
 
The premise of Defendant’s motion
is that Plaintiff should be barred from testifying/offering evidence regarding
the definition, nature, and purpose of ER Visitation Fees because she lacks
personal knowledge.  (See Motion, pp.
2-4.)  Defendant contends definition,
nature, and purpose are “area[s] for expert testimony.”  (Id. at p. 2.)
 
Primarily, Defendant asks the
Court to exclude testimony or evidence that is contrary to the definition
announced by the California Supreme Court in Capito v. San Jose Healthcare
System, LP (Cal. Dec. 23, 2024, No. S280018) 2024 WL 5196670.  (See id. at p. 4.)
 
Plaintiff disagrees.  She claims the motion should be denied
because:
 
* it is a disguised motion for
summary adjudication (see Opposition, p. 2);
 
* the Supreme Court “did not
hold, or even suggest, that an ER Visitation Fee is a fee for services rendered
by a hospital to an individual patient” (ibid.); and
 
* the Supreme Court “made no
factual findings as to the purpose of ER Visitation Fees.”  (Ibid.)
 
The Court believes the motion
should be denied without prejudice.  Even
assuming it is not a disguised motion for summary adjudication, it is
deniable because it is a prophylactic motion (Defendant does not identify
actual, particular testimony or evidence to be excluded) and cannot be decided
in a vacuum.  (See Kelly v. New West Federal Savings
(1996) 49 Cal. App. 4th 659, 670.)
 
For now, Capito
does not change the result.  Certainly,
the Court intends to take the definition seriously since it appears in a
Supreme Court decision.  But the
defendant was San Jose Healthcare System, LP, not Cedars-Sinai, and the
decision does not analyze a contract claim. 
Whether Defendant utilized the Capito definition in the
Conditions of Admission contracts is a question of fact.  Whether Defendant complied with the Capito
definition in performing the contracts is also a question of fact.  As a general matter, evidence concerning
these facts should be allowed to answer these questions.
 
Nevertheless, Defendant will be
free to assert objections – e.g., foundation and speculation – to specific
evidence at trial.  The Court grants
Defendant leave to raise such objections at that time.
