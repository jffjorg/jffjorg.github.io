TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant’s motion in limine no. 2 is denied without prejudice to
Defendant making specific objections to specific class members at trial.
 
BACKGROUND
 
“This is a class action. . . . 
Plaintiff alleges that Cedars-Sinai charges an undisclosed fee – the ER
Visitation Fee – for seeking treatment at Cedars-Sinai’s emergency room.”  (2/14/23 Tentative Ruling Re: Motion for
Class Certification, p. 1.)
 
Here, Cedars-Sinai seeks orders:
 
* “precluding any class member from testifying about their interpretation
of any term within the Conditions of Admissions agreement” (“COA”) “without
first establishing personal knowledge of the subject matter” (Motion, p. 2,
italics in original); and
 
* “allowing defense counsel to voir dire any class member before direct
examination.”  (Ibid.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
The first part of Defendant’s
motion is a prophylactic motion. 
Defendant does not identify actual, particular testimony to be excluded.  The Court finds that the motion should be
denied because the Court cannot rule in a vacuum.  (See Kelly
v. New West Federal Savings (1996) 49 Cal. App. 4th 659, 670.)[1]
 
The remedy for Defendant is to
make specific objections to specific class members at trial.  For example, defense counsel could assert a
foundation objection to require Plaintiff’s counsel to elicit testimony showing
that the testifying class member did read/have personal knowledge of the COA
before he or she signed it.  The Court
grants Defendant leave to assert such objections at the appropriate time.
 
The second part of Defendant’s
motion is also be denied.  Defendant
fails to cite authority requiring pre-testimony voir dire of class
members.  Also, the Court believes
Defendant’s ability to raise foundation objections and to cross-examine should
suffice to protect Defendant’s interests.
