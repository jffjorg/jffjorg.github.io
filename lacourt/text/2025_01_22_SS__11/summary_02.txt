And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Cedars-Sinai Medical Center's motion in limine no. 1, which sought to prevent plaintiff Amy Fleschert from testifying about her interpretation of the Conditions of Admissions agreement. The agreement is related to the ER Visitation Fee, which the plaintiff alleges is an undisclosed fee charged by Cedars-Sinai. The judge denied the motion, finding that the plaintiff's testimony about reading the agreement before signing is not entirely inconsistent, as she testified that she "can't remember" reading it, but also said she "skimmed through" the agreement. The judge granted the defendant leave to make specific objections to specific testimony at trial.
