```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies without prejudice the defendant's motion in limine No. 5, which seeks to exclude testimony and evidence regarding the definition, nature, and purpose of ER Visitation Fees. The defendant argues that the plaintiff lacks personal knowledge about these topics and that they are areas for expert testimony. The plaintiff disagrees, claiming that the motion is a disguised motion for summary adjudication and that the California Supreme Court's decision in Capito v. San Jose Healthcare System, LP does not hold or suggest that an ER Visitation Fee is a fee for services rendered by a hospital to an individual patient. The judge finds that the motion is a prophylactic motion that cannot be decided in a vacuum and grants the defendant leave to raise specific objections to evidence at trial.
