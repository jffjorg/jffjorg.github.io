For the same reason, it is unnecessary here to decide the parties’ dispute
regarding reasonable-person testimony. 
The Court notes, though, that Plaintiff does not cite law recognizing a
right to call class members to testify about the meaning of COAs that they did
not read.

TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant’s motion in limine no. 3 is moot and/or denied without
prejudice to Defendant making specific objections to specific testimony at
trial.
 
BACKGROUND
 
“This is a class action. . . . 
Plaintiff alleges that Cedars-Sinai charges an undisclosed fee – the ER
Visitation Fee – for seeking treatment at Cedars-Sinai’s emergency room.”  (2/14/23 Tentative Ruling Re: Motion for
Class Certification, p. 1.)
 
Here, Cedars-Sinai seeks “an order precluding Plaintiff . . . from
testifying about the experiences of any other class members[.]”  (Motion, p. 2.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
The premise of Defendant’s motion
is that Plaintiff should be barred from testifying regarding other class
members’ experiences because she lacks personal knowledge.  (See Motion, pp. 2, 3.)
 
The Court believes the motion is
moot and/or should be denied.  It is moot
in that Plaintiff stipulates that she “does not personally intend to mention
other class members’ experiences on these topics in the presence of the jury
unless and until they are admitted in evidence[.]”  (Opposition, p. 2.)  It is deniable because it is a prophylactic
motion (Defendant does not identify actual, particular testimony to be
excluded) and cannot be decided in a vacuum.  (See Kelly
v. New West Federal Savings (1996) 49 Cal. App. 4th 659, 670.)
 
If Plaintiff attempts to provide
such testimony at trial, Defendant will be free to assert objections – e.g.,
foundation and speculation.  The Court
grants Defendant leave to raise such objections at that time.

TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant’s motion in limine no. 4 is moot and/or denied without
prejudice to Defendant making specific objections to specific testimony at
trial.
 
BACKGROUND
 
“This is a class action. . . . 
Plaintiff alleges that Cedars-Sinai charges an undisclosed fee – the ER
Visitation Fee – for seeking treatment at Cedars-Sinai’s emergency room.”  (2/14/23 Tentative Ruling Re: Motion for
Class Certification, p. 1.)
 
Here, Cedars-Sinai seeks “an order precluding Plaintiff from testifying
about”: 
 
* “the value of medical services rendered by Cedars-Sinai” (Motion, p.
2); and
 
* “the medical services that were ‘medically necessary.’”  (Ibid.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
The premise of Defendant’s motion
is that Plaintiff should be barred from testifying regarding the value and
necessity of medical services because she lacks personal knowledge.  Defendant contends value and necessity are
“within the exclusive purview of experts.” 
(See Motion, p. 2.)
 
The Court believes the motion is
moot and/or should be denied.  It is moot
in that Plaintiff stipulates that she “does not personally intend to mention
these matters in the presence of the jury unless and until they are admitted in
evidence[.]”  (Opposition, p. 2.)  It is deniable because it is a prophylactic
motion (Defendant does not identify actual, particular testimony to be
excluded) and cannot be decided in a vacuum.  (See Kelly
v. New West Federal Savings (1996) 49 Cal. App. 4th 659, 670.)
 
If Plaintiff attempts to provide
such testimony at trial, Defendant will be free to assert objections – e.g.,
foundation and speculation.  The Court
grants Defendant leave to raise such objections at that time.
 
As a matter of guidance, though,
the Court does generally agree with Defendant that the “reasonable value of
medical services is an area for expert testimony[.]”  (Reply, p. 2 [citing Pebley v. Santa Clara
Organics, LLC (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 1266, 1275, which recognizes
that expert testimony concerning the reasonable value of services rendered
should be presented].)

TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s motion in limine no. 2 is denied without prejudice to
Plaintiff making specific objections to specific evidence at trial.
 
BACKGROUND
 
“This is a class action. . . . 
Plaintiff alleges that Cedars-Sinai charges an undisclosed fee – the ER
Visitation Fee – for seeking treatment at Cedars-Sinai’s emergency room.”  (2/14/23 Tentative Ruling Re: Motion for
Class Certification, p. 1.)
 
Here, Plaintiff seeks to preclude Defendant from using evidence regarding
industry standards to interpret the Conditions of Admission (“COA”) contracts.
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff contends the motion in limine should be granted because
industry-standards evidence is irrelevant:
 
[T]he entire concept of industry standard has
no application in the context of a consumer claim based on an adhesive contract
drafted by the Defendant, such as the present case. After all, industry
standard, when it is relevant, is offered to prove the mutual intention of the
parties, not simply the defendant’s intention. Wolf v. Superior Court
(2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1343, 1351, 1356. The Supreme Court’s decision in Ermolieff
v. R.K.O. Radio Pictures (1942) 19 Cal.2d 543, 550 (cited in Wolf,
114 Cal.App.4th at 1357-1358) makes clear that, for evidence of a trade usage to
be relevant, “both parties” must be engaged in the trade. In the instant
action, Plaintiff and Breach of Contract Class members are not industry players
whose intentions can be determined based on a standard applicable in the
hospital industry. Because they are not “engaged” in the hospital trade, any
“extrinsic evidence” of such trade usage is completely irrelevant to the
contract interpretation question presented.
 
(Motion, pp. 3-4, underlining of case names added.)
 
Defendant claims “Plaintiff’s motion is predicated on the erroneous
statement . . . that custom or usage in the industry is only relevant if
both parties are engaged in the industry[.]” 
(Opposition, p. 2, emphasis in original.)  Defendant contends “the controlling and
accurate recitation of law is far broader”:
 
“For evidence of custom to have potency it
must be established that the parties to the contract were aware of the
existence of the custom.”  (Miller v.
Stults (1956) 143 Cal.App.2d 592, 601.) 
While being actively engaged in the trade is one way to establish
awareness of the custom, knowledge of the custom can also be imputed
where the custom “is so commonly accepted that the public is presumed to
recognize its existence.”  (Id., p. 602,
bolding added; accord. Latta v. Da Roza (1929) 100 Cal.App. 606, 609
[“To bind one who is not engaged
in the trade or occupation which
employs the usage relied upon, proof of his actual knowledge of the usage is
necessary, unless it is so commonly accepted that the public is presumed to
recognize its existence.”  Bolding
added.].)  That rule of law – contrary to
Plaintiff’s misguided statement – is well established.  (See, e.g., Miller v. Germain Seed &
Plant Co. (1924) 193 Cal. 62, 69 [“The rule that a person will be presumed
to have contracted with reference to a general custom or usage whether he knew
of that custom or not has frequently been invoked.”]; Webster v. Klassen
(1952) 109 Cal.App.2d 583, 589 [“[B]efore a custom can enter into or affect the
rights and liabilities of parties in their dealings with each other, such
custom must be certain, uniform, and either known to those sought to be charged
thereby, or so generally known and notorious that knowledge and adoption
thereof must be presumed”]; Robertson v. Dodson (1942) 54 Cal.App.2d
661, 664 [“A person is not bound by a custom or usage unless he had actual
knowledge thereof, or it is so general or well–known in the community as to
give rise to the presumption of such knowledge.”].)
 
(Id. at pp. 2-3, underlining of case names added, emphasis in original.)
 
In reply, Plaintiff states:
 
. . . Defendant states that it intends to
offer evidence that: “(1) the COA is based on a form contract used by many
hospitals in the industry and (2) most, if not all, Emergency
Departments charge an EMS Fee to patients.” (Opp., at 4:7-9.) However, each
hospital drafts its own COA, and the language varies widely. Neither of
Defendant’s purported “facts” is even remotely relevant to interpretation of Defendant’s
COA, or the language Defendant chose to use. Even if every single emergency
department in California charges an ER Visitation Fee, that does not change the
language Defendant chose to use in its COA, and has nothing to do with how
to interpret Defendant’s COA, including its “services rendered” language.
Simply put, evidence of an industry standard to charge ER Visitation Fees does
not mean that Defendant was permitted to charge such fees under its COA,
regardless of what its COA actually says.
 
Even under Defendant’s argument and cited
case law, what is encompassed within the term “services rendered” is not “so
commonly accepted that the public is presumed to recognize its existence,” or
“so generally known and notorious that knowledge and adoption thereof must be
presumed.” (Opp., at 2:21-22, 3:1-2 (citations omitted).) Defendant does not
even suggest that this is true, and it clearly is not. Therefore, even under
Defendant’s argument, evidence of a purported “industry standard” is not admissible
to aid in interpretation of Defendant’s COA here.
 
(Reply, pp. 1-2, footnotes omitted, emphasis in original.)
 
The Court turns to the law.
 
“Usage can be invoked only to interpret, not to create, contractual
terms.”  (1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law
(11th ed. 2024) Contracts, § 778.)
 
However, “[u]sage or custom may be looked to, both to explain the meaning of language and to
imply terms, where no contrary intent appears from the terms of the contract.”  (Ibid.) 
 
Moreover, “a reasonable usage may supply an omitted term or otherwise
supplement an agreement.”  (Ibid.)
 
“For a custom to be operative, the parties must assent to it, or
one party must know or have reason to know the other party intends it to
govern, or it must be so generally known that a person should be aware
of it.”  (Id. at § 779, emphasis
added.)  
 
“Knowledge of a custom may be presumed from the fact that the custom is
of general application in a particular industry.”  (Ibid.) 

 
Also, “knowledge of usage may be inferred from fact that party is engaged
in trade or industry in which usage is common[.]”  (Ibid.) 

 
Given these rules, the Court believes the motion should be denied for two
reasons.  One, it is a
prophylactic motion (Plaintiff does not identify actual, particular testimony or
evidence to be excluded) and cannot be decided in a vacuum.  (See Kelly
v. New West Federal Savings (1996) 49 Cal. App. 4th 659, 670.)  Two, Plaintiff fails to establish that
Defendant lacks foundation to show that the purported industry standard – i.e.,
the custom or usage – is “so generally
known that a person should be aware of it.” 
(Witkin, supra, § 779.)  The
current record does not support such a finding.
 
Plaintiff’s remedy is to raise
objections at trial.  For example,
Plaintiff’s counsel could assert a foundation objection to require defense
counsel to lay foundation before particular custom evidence is admitted.  The Court grants Plaintiff leave to assert
such objections at the appropriate time.
