The Plaintiff is ordered to provide responses without objection within 20 days of the order. The Judge denies Defendant's request for sanctions for alleged misuse of discovery. The ruling is based on the fact that Defendant properly served discovery requests and Plaintiff failed to provide responses, entitling Defendant to a court order directing Plaintiff to provide verified responses.
