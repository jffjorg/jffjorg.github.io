The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendant's Motion to Compel, granting the motion and ordering the Plaintiff to appear for an independent medical examination (IME) with Dr. Michael P. Weinstein on January 30, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. The Plaintiff failed to appear for previously scheduled IMEs on April 14, 2023 and September 5, 2023, and did not respond to the Defendant's demands for a physical examination. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has waived their objection to the motion and has not disputed their failure to appear for the IME. The Defendant's request for sanctions is denied as the Plaintiff did not unsuccessfully oppose the motion.
