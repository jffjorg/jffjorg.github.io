 Case Number:  21STCV24799    Hearing Date:   November 13, 2023    Dept:  30 CHESTER PATTON vs CHRIS WINVICKRequest for Entry of Default JudgmentTentative: The Court has reviewed the request for default judgment and is DENIED without prejudice due to the following defects:(1) Damages have not been proved. Despite claiming $50,000 in special damages, there is only evidence to support $15,488.33 in medical bills. Thus, the request for Court judgment must be adjusted to special damages in the amount of $15,488.33.(2) In light of the fact that the proof for special damages is only in the amount of $15,488.33, general damages in the amount of $125,000 are excessive. The court is only inclined to award general damages in an amount that is at most three times special damages. Thus, the request for Court judgment must also be adjusted with respect to the amount sought in general damages.In addition, California Rules of Court, rule 3.110 requires Plaintiff to obtain entry of default a within 10 days after the time for service has elapsed and a default judgment within 45 days after the default was entered. California Rules of Court, rule 3.740 requires obtaining a default judgment within 365 days of the filing of the complaint. Pursuant to Gov. Code § 68608, trial courts shall have the power to impose sanctions to enforce the requirements of a delay reduction program, including the power to striking pleadings or dismissing actions if less severe sanctions are ineffective. LASC local rule 3.10 allows the Court to impose sanctions for the failure or refusal to comply with time standards or deadlines. Moreover, the court is mindful of Garcia v. McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal.4th 469.Accordingly, the Court sets in 35 days a final OSC re dismissal for failure to timely perfect / obtain a Default Judgment pursuant to CRC Rule 3.110(h) and (i), CRC Rule 3.740, CCP 581(b)(4), CCP 583.410, and 583.420(a)(2)(B).
