And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion for leave to intervene filed by Liberty Mutual, Dillard's insurer. Liberty Mutual seeks to intervene in the case because it may be exposed to direct liability under Insurance Code section 11580 if Dillard does not defend the case. The Judge finds that Liberty Mutual has a direct and immediate interest in the case and that its intervention would not enlarge the issues. The Judge also notes that Dillard is not defending the case and that Liberty Mutual has made attempts to contact Dillard, but has been unable to do so. The Judge orders Liberty Mutual to file its answer-in-intervention within 10 days and requires notice to the moving party.
