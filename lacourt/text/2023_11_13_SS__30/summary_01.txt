And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Defendants' motion to continue the trial date. The motion was filed to push the trial date from November 13, 2023, to April 1, 2024. The Judge found that the Defendants did not show good cause to continue the trial date and that the age of the case, the currently scheduled discovery, and the prejudice to the opposing side weigh against a continuance. The Judge also noted that the possibility of mediation, which the Defendants had requested, was not a sufficient reason to continue the trial date. The Judge will deny the motion to continue filed by the Defendants.
