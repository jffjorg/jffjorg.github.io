Summary in English:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Defendant's motion for summary judgment. The Plaintiff requests judicial notice of certain facts, including the condition of Mission Gorge Road in San Diego in 2009 and the block on the southern side of Bay Street in Santa Monica. The Judge declines to rule on the Plaintiff's request as it is unnecessary.

The Defendant argues that there is no evidence that an employee of the City created the condition through a negligent, wrongful act or omission, and that there is also no evidence that the City knew or should have known of the alleged conditions and their allegedly dangerous character. The Judge finds that the Defendant has met its burden of proof on this issue.

The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff's argument that the City had constructive notice of the dangerous condition is not persuasive, citing to the case Heskel v. City of San Diego (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 313. The Judge finds that the condition was not obvious and that the City's inspection system was adequate.

Finally, the Judge notes that the Plaintiff's request for judicial notice is unnecessary and declines to rule on the request. The Judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after the parties have an opportunity to respond.
