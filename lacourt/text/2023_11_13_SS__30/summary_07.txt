And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has reviewed the request for default judgment and is denying it without prejudice due to several defects. The Plaintiff claimed $50,000 in special damages, but the evidence only supports $15,488.33 in medical bills. Therefore, the request for judgment must be adjusted to reflect this reduced amount. Additionally, the Court finds that the requested general damages of $125,000 are excessive, and will only award general damages in an amount that is at most three times the special damages. The Court also notes that the Plaintiff failed to obtain entry of default within the required timeframe, and will set a deadline for a final OSC re dismissal.
