Glenair, Inc.)

```

And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling clarifies the scope of a Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) settlement. The PAGA action does not involve individual claims for Labor Code penalties, but rather allows the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) to assess civil penalties. A PAGA settlement should only preclude future PAGA enforcement and not employees' individual claims. This ruling is based on the California Supreme Court's decisions in Julian v. Glenair, Inc. and Iskanian v. Schorr, which hold that a PAGA claim is a dispute between an employer and the state, and that PAGA does not create new substantive rights or legal obligations.
