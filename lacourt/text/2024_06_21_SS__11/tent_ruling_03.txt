TENTATIVE RULING
 
Wilcox III
(23STCV24794) is stayed.
 
BACKGROUND
 
Wilcox III (23STCV24794)
is a putative class action.  The
complaint asserts a single cause of action under the Unfair Competition Law
(“UCL”) based on alleged Labor Code violations. 
 
Prior to filing Wilcox III,
Plaintiff filed a putative class action under the Labor Code (Wilcox I
(23STCV04472)) and a Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”) representative
action that asserts the same purported violations of the Labor Code (Wilcox
II (23STCV13382)).
 
Wilcox I is pending before
Judge Lawrence Riff in Department 7.  On
June 4, 2024, he ordered ATC to file notices of related case in Wilcox II
and Wilcox III.
 
Wilcox II is pending
before Judge Gail Killefer in Department 37. 
On November 8 2023, she granted ATC’s motion to dismiss or stay due to
forum non conveniens and stayed Wilcox II.
 
Here, ATC seeks to abate Wilcox
III pending the outcome of Wilcox I and Wilcox II.
 
LAW
 
Statutory Plea in Abatement
 
“Under the statutory plea in abatement, ‘[t]he pendency of
another earlier action growing out of the same transaction and between the same
parties is a ground for abatement of the second action.’”  (People ex rel. Garamendi v. American
Autoplan, Inc. (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 760, 770.) “A statutory
plead in abatement requires that the prior pending action be “between
the same parties on the same cause of action.” 
(Ibid., emphasis in original.)
 
Exclusive Concurrent
Jurisdiction
 
“Although the rule of exclusive concurrent
jurisdiction is similar in effect to the statutory plea in abatement, it
has been interpreted and applied more expansively, and therefore may apply
where the narrow grounds required for a statutory plea [in] abatement do not
exist.”  (Ibid.) 
“Unlike the statutory plea [in] abatement, the rule of exclusive
concurrent jurisdiction does not require absolute identity of parties,
causes of action or remedies sought in the initial and subsequent actions.”  (Ibid.)  “If the court exercising original jurisdiction
has the power to bring before it all the necessary parties, the fact that the
parties in the second action are not identical does not preclude application of
the rule.”  (Ibid.)  “Moreover, the remedies sought in the separate
actions need not be precisely the same so long as the court exercising original
jurisdiction has the power to litigate all the issues and grant all the relief
to which any of the parties might be entitled under the pleadings.”  (Ibid.)
 
Inherent Authority
 
Trial courts have inherent
authority to manage and control their proceedings, “including the inherent
authority to stay an action when appropriate . . . [to] overcome problems of
simultaneous litigation.”  (Jordache
Enterprises, Inc. v. Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison (1998) 18 Cal.4th
739, 758.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
For statutory plea in abatement,
Plaintiff contends the requirements cannot be satisfied because Wilcox I,
II, and III allege different causes of action.  (See Opposition, pp. 1-2.)
 
For the doctrine of exclusive
concurrent jurisdiction, Plaintiff contends the requirements cannot be
satisfied because all three cases are pending in the Los Angeles Superior Court
as opposed to in different counties. 
(See id. at pp. 2-3.)
 
For inherent authority, Plaintiff
contends a stay is unnecessary.  He
suggests that ATC should move to relate and/or consolidate the three cases
instead.  (See id. at pp. 3-4.)
 
The Court disagrees in part.  Judge
Killefer already found that Wilcox I’s Labor Code class claims
and Wilcox II’s PAGA representative claim “arise out of the same
facts[.]”  (ATC’s Request for Judicial
Notice, Ex. D, p. 3.)[1]  The same is true of Wilcox III’s UCL
class claim.  All three cases allege the
same class and/or representative group of aggrieved employees and the same
Labor Code violations.  (See Demurrer,
pp. 5-6; see also Reply, pp. 2-4; ATC’s Request for Judicial Notice, Exs. A-C;
see also Wilcox III First Amended Complaint.)  The primary right involved in all three is
the same.  (See, e.g., Bush v.
Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1374, 1384 [noting, in the
context of a statutory plea in abatement, that “[t]he identity of two causes of action is determined by a comparison
of the facts alleged which show the nature of the invasion of plaintiff's
primary right”].)  Consequently, at
minimum, it is appropriate to stay Wilcox III pursuant to the Court’s
inherent authority.
 
Nevertheless, the Court agrees
that the cases should be related and/or consolidated.  Since the same primary right is involved, one
judge should hear all three cases and all claims at the same time.  Wilcox I is the oldest case, so Judge
Riff should be the one to decide the relation and/or consolidation issues.
 
Until then, the Court stays Wilcox
III.
