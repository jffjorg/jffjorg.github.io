TENTATIVE RULING
 
The hearing is continued as to the gross settlement amount
($1,240,000.00) and the net settlement amount ($781,393.04). 
The Court orders Plaintiffs’ counsel to file a supplemental declaration.


The settlement is
fair, reasonable, and adequate as to the:
 
* attorney fees
($413,333.33);
 
* attorney costs
($23,723.63); and
 
* administration
costs ($6,550.00).
 
The incentive awards are reduced ($5,000.00 per
Plaintiff, $10,000.00 total). 
 
During oral arguments, the Court intends to
question Plaintiffs’ counsel about the scope of the releases.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a wage-and-hour
representative PAGA action.
 
In February 2024, the parties
participated in a mediation and eventually reached a settlement.
 
Here, Plaintiffs ask the Court to
approve the settlement.
 
LAW
 
PAGA permits an “aggrieved employee” to recover
Labor Code civil penalties on the Labor & Workforce Development Agency’s
(“LWDA”) behalf, if the LWDA declines to collect the penalties itself.  (Cal. Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (a); see also Mejia
v. Merchants Building Maintenance, LLC (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 723,
732-733.)  The California Supreme Court
has distinguished between Labor Code “civil penalties” that are “intended to
‘punish the employer’ for wrongdoing, often ‘without reference to the actual
damage sustained’” and “statutory damages” that “primarily seek to compensate
employees for actual losses incurred” – a PAGA action can recover only the
former.  (Z.B., N.A. v. Superior Court
(2019) 8 Cal.5th 175, 182, 198 [holding that Labor Code section 558 “amount
sufficient to recover unpaid wages” is not a “civil penalty” recoverable via
PAGA].) “A PAGA action is ‘fundamentally a law enforcement action designed to
protect the public and not to benefit private parties.’”  (Mejia, supra, 38 Cal.App.5th
at 732; see also Iskanian v. CLS Transportation Los Angeles, LLC (2014)
59 Cal.4th 348, 381.)
 
PAGA requires a court to “review and approve
any settlement of any civil action filed” under PAGA, but it does not provide
review and approval standards or guidelines. (Cal. Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (l)(2).)  The California Supreme Court has interpreted PAGA
as requiring courts to ensure that “any negotiated [PAGA] resolution is fair
to those affected.”  (Williams v.
Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 549, emphasis added).)  The parties affected by a PAGA settlement
include: (1) the LWDA, who receives 75% of settlement funds and is “bound by
the outcome of the proceeding to adjudicate the employee’s PAGA claim” (Mejia,
supra, 38 Cal.App.5th at 732); (2) the aggrieved employees, both party
and non-party, who receive 25% percent of settlement funds and are, like the
LWDA, bound by a PAGA action judgment; (3) plaintiffs’ counsel, who may be
awarded reasonable attorney fees and costs; and (4) defendant, who pays the
settlement.  
 
Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021)
72 Cal.App.5th 56 provides greater detail about the standard courts
should apply when evaluating PAGA settlements. 
The opinion adopts the “fair, reasonable, and adequate” standard used in
class settlements.

Analysis
 
Plaintiffs’ counsel’s declaration establishes
that, throughout the litigation, and in preparing for mediation, the parties
took part in informal discovery.  (See
Chang Decl., ¶¶ 21-22, 24-25.) 
Plaintiff’s counsel used the information to assess the value of the case
and the associated risks.  (See, e.g.,
id. at ¶ 28.)  Ultimately, Plaintiff’s
counsel came up with maximum and discounted estimates.  (See id. at ¶¶ 48-64.)  Plaintiff’s counsel asserts that the gross
settlement amount ($1,240,000.00) is within a reasonable range, especially
considering the defenses Defendant raised, and that the settlement is
fair, reasonable, and adequate.  (See id.
at ¶¶ 6-8, 64.)
 
The Court finds as follows.
 
Gross Settlement Amount
 
The parties agreed to the gross settlement
amount ($1,240,000.00) via arm’s-length mediation after investigation
and discovery.
 
Nevertheless, the Court finds
that the hearing should be continued. 
The gross settlement amount constitutes approximately 6% of the maximum
possible exposure (see id. at ¶ 58) and approximately 13% of the discounted
estimate.  (See id. at ¶ 63.)  Plaintiffs’ counsel fails to provide a
minimum estimate in his declaration, so it is unclear whether the gross
settlement amount exceeds the minimum estimate. 
The Court orders Plaintiffs’ counsel to provide a supplemental
declaration to address this point.
 
Attorney Fees
 
The amount for attorney fees ($413,333.33)
is fair, reasonable, and adequate because Plaintiffs’ counsel
represented Plaintiffs on a contingency basis. 
(See Motion, p. 20.)  One-third of
the gross recovery is standard in contingency cases.
 
Attorney Costs
 
The amount for attorney costs ($23,723.63)
is fair, reasonable, and adequate because, in addition to being modest in
general, it is less than 2% of the gross settlement amount.
 
The settlement agreement sets a
$40,000.00 cap for costs, but Plaintiffs’ counsel has only incurred $23,723.63
so far.  The Court finds that the
incurred amount should be awarded instead of the capped amount.  This will allow additional settlement money
to go to the LWDA and aggrieved employees. 

 
Administration Costs
 
The amount for administration costs ($6,550.00)
is fair, reasonable, and adequate because it is unopposed and within the range
that this Court has approved in other complex cases.  It is less than 1% of the gross settlement
amount. 
 
Incentive Awards
 
The Court finds that the amount
for the incentive awards ($7,500.00 per Plaintiff) should be
reduced.  The Court believes $5,000.00
per Plaintiff is standard and appropriate, and the Court sees nothing in the
record that supports more than the standard award.
 
Net Settlement Amount
 
Whether the net settlement amount ($781,393.04)
is fair, reasonable, and adequate depends on whether the gross settlement
amount ends up being found fair, reasonable, and adequate.  The hearing is continued as to this portion
of the motion.
 
Releases
 
The releases state:
 
5.1. Plaintiffs’
Release. Plaintiffs and their respective former and present spouses,
representatives, agents, attorneys (including PAGA Counsel), heirs,
administrators, successors, and assigns generally, release and discharge
Released Parties from all claims, transactions, or occurrences that occurred

were, or reasonably could have been, alleged, based on the facts contained in
the Operative Complaint and the PAGA Notice (“Plaintiffs’ Release”).
Plaintiffs’ Release does not extend to any claims or actions to enforce this
Agreement, or to any claims for vested benefits, unemployment benefits,
disability benefits, social security benefits, workers’ compensation benefits,
wrongful termination, violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act,
discrimination, harassment, or retaliation related claims that arose at any
time, or claims based on occurrences outside the PAGA Period. Plaintiff
acknowledges that Plaintiff may discover facts or law different from, or in
addition to, the facts or law that Plaintiff now knows or believes to be true
but agrees, nonetheless, that Plaintiffs’ Release shall be and remain effective
in all respects, notwithstanding such different or additional facts or
Plaintiffs’ discovery of them.

applicable California Industrial Welfare Commission (“IWC”) Wage Orders,
including but not limited to IWC Wage Order No. 4 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, §
11040 (“PAGA Released Claims”), against the Released Parties. Upon approval of
the Settlement, Plaintiffs and the Aggrieved Employees will be forever barred
from pursuing against the Released Parties any and all claims for civil
penalties under PAGA based upon alleged violations of the California Labor
Code, Wage Orders, regulations, and/or other provisions of the law alleged or
that could have been alleged to have been violated in, or reasonably related
to, the Action.
 
5.3. Release by
PAGA Counsel: PAGA Counsel release, on behalf of their present and former
attorneys, employees, agents, successors and assigns, the Released Parties from
all claims for PAGA Fees incurred in connection with the Operative Complaint
and the PAGA Period facts stated in the Operative Complaint and the PAGA
Notice, except as described herein.
 
(Chang Decl.,
Ex. 1, §§ 5.1-5.3, bolding in original.)
 
The Court is concerned about overbreadth.  Do the parties have standing to release
claims on behalf of heirs, successors, etc.?  At the hearing, counsel needs to address the
scope of the releases.[1]
