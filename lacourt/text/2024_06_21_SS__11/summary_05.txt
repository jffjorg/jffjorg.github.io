And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to seal the settlement amount in a class action lawsuit concerning website spyware. The plaintiff's individual claims will be dismissed with prejudice, and the class claims will be dismissed without prejudice. The settlement agreement requires the plaintiff's counsel to submit a copy of the agreement, which was done on June 4, 2024. The judge has considered the rules regarding sealing of court records and has determined that the motion should be granted because the settlement amount is confidential and sealing is the least restrictive means to protect this interest.
