[1] Notably, a PAGA
action does not involve aggrieved employees’ individual claims for Labor Code
penalties, only civil penalties that the LWDA may assess.  In light of this, a PAGA settlement should
only preclude future PAGA enforcement and not employees’ individual
claims.  (See, e.g., Julian v.
Glenair, Inc. (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 853, 871 [“PAGA does not create any new substantive rights or legal
obligations, but ‘is simply a procedural statute allowing an aggrieved employee
to recover civil penalties — for Labor Code violations — that otherwise would
be sought by state labor law enforcement agencies’”]; see also Iskanian,
supra, 59 Cal.4th at pp. 386-387 [a PAGA claim “is a dispute
between an employer and the state, which alleges directly or through its
agents — either the Labor and Workforce Development Agency or aggrieved
employees — that the employer has violated the Labor Code”].)
