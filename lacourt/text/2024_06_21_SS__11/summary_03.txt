And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled that the case, Wilcox III, is stayed pending the outcome of Wilcox I and Wilcox II. The court found that Wilcox I, II, and III all allege the same class and/or representative group of aggrieved employees and the same Labor Code violations, and therefore, it is appropriate to stay Wilcox III. Additionally, the court agrees that the cases should be related and/or consolidated, and has ordered Judge Riff, who is handling Wilcox I, to decide the relation and/or consolidation issues.
