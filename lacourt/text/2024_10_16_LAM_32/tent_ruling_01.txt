            v.
 
NATIONAL GENERAL INSURANCE COMPANY, et
  al., 
                        
                       Defendants. 


 
  Case No.:  23STCV16760
  Hearing Date:  October 16, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motions to compel further
  responses to special interrogatories 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On July 18, 2023, Plaintiff
Adalberto Campos filed this action against various insurance companies,
asserting breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing. The complaint stems from Defendants’ alleged refusal to cover
an auto accident that Plaintiff was involved in. Specifically, Defendants
allegedly rescinded coverage based on Plaintiff’s purported failure to disclose
an additional driver (Daniel Campos) on the policy. Plaintiff alleges that
Daniel Campos was a minor at the time of the accident, was not an additional
driver, and was not driving or present at the time of the accident.  
            On September 20, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant three motions to compel further interrogatory responses from
Defendants National General Insurance Company, Integon National Insurance
Company, and Allstate Insurance Company. Defendants have not filed an
opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Upon receiving responses to its discovery
requests, the propounding party may move for an order compelling further
responses if the responses are incomplete or evasive, or objections are without
merit or too general. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(a), 2031.310(a),
2033.290(a).) The party seeking production of documents
bears the initial burden of showing good cause through a fact-specific showing
of relevance. (Kirkland v. Superior Court (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.)
Once this showing is made, the burden shifts to the responding party to justify
any objections. (Ibid.) 
MEET AND CONFER
            A motion to compel further must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration demonstrating an attempt to
resolve the matter informally. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300(b)(1),
2031.310(b), 2033.290(b).) The Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied the meet
and confer requirement. (See Tabone Decl.)
DISCUSSION
A party “is entitled to demand answers to
its interrogatories, as a matter of right . . . [and] the burden of justifying
any objection and failure to respond remains at all times with the party
resisting an interrogatory.” (Williams v. Sup. Ct. (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531,
541.) 
The interrogatories at issue seek
information about Defendants’ rescission of policies. This is relevant because
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants improperly rescinded his policy after a claim
was made. Defendants have not filed an opposition and thus have not justified
their resistance to the interrogatories. As a result, further responses are
warranted. 
Sanctions are also warranted as Defendants
provide no substantial justification for their failure to properly respond to
the interrogatories. Plaintiff’s counsel claims an hourly rate of $450. (Tabone
Decl. ¶ 11.) The Court finds this reasonable. Counsel claims to have spent 3
hours per motion, for a total of 9 hours. (Ibid.) Given the simplicity
and duplicative nature of the motions, the Court finds that 4 hours is
reasonable for all three motions combined. Lastly, counsel reasonably claims a
$60 filing fee. Thus, total sanctions are $1,860. 
 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motions to compel
further responses are GRANTED. Defendants National General Insurance Company,
Integon National Insurance Company, and Allstate Insurance Company shall
provide further responses within 20 days of this order. The Court sanctions
Defendants and their counsel in the total amount of $1,860, to be paid within
30 days of this order.
