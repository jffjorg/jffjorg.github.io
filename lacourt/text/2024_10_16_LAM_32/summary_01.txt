And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories from the defendants. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants improperly rescinded his insurance policy after an auto accident, and the plaintiff seeks information about the defendants' rescission of policies. The defendants have failed to respond or justify their objections, and the judge finds that further responses are warranted. The judge also orders the defendants to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,860, which is reasonable given the simplicity and duplicative nature of the motions. The defendants have 20 days to provide further responses, and the sanctions must be paid within 30 days.
