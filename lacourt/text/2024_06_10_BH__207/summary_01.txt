And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) because the declarations submitted in support of the motion do not comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b). The judge finds that the declarations do not provide the required information, such as the effect of the amendment, why the amendment is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered, and the reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The judge orders Plaintiff to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
