And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff's motion to enter judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant. The settlement agreement between the parties provides that Defendant shall pay Plaintiff $37,000 by wire transfer no later than March 8, 2024. Since Defendant did not pay the amount, Plaintiff requests judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant in the amount of $50,000, less any payments received by Plaintiff. The court finds that a valid and binding settlement agreement exists between the parties and grants Plaintiff's motion.
