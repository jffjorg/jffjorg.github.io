[1] As
the Association points out (Opp. at 1, n.1), Key’s 24-page moving papers exceed
the 15-page limit of CRC 3.1113(d).  The
court previously exercised its discretion for the April 5, 2022 preliminary
injunction motion to consider only the first 15 pages of Key’s brief and does
so again.  As a result, Key’s arguments concerning
the $48,464.28 award of costs, the Arbitrator’s refusal to permit amendment of
claims, his ruling on the application of CCP section 437c, and his ruling on discovery
have not been considered.

All further statutory references are to the Civil Code unless otherwise stated.


[3] The Arbitrator’s statement that he was exercising
such discretion as the law allows may be understood as a reference to the
reasonable amount of attorney fees, not entitlement.  


[4] The Arbitrator stated that he did not award fees under section 5975(c)
for the OMA and record inspection claims (erroneously referred to by the
Association’s fee reply and the Arbitrator as the second and sixth
claims).  Ex. 5, p. 7.
