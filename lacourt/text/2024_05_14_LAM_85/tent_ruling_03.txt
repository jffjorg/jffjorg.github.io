Medina Culver D.O., et al. v. Counter
Brands, LLC; 
24STCV03402

Tentative decision on application
for preliminary injunction: granted




 



 
Plaintiffs Medina Culver, D.O.
(“Culver”), Ruby Guardia (“Guardia”), Julie Eisenberg (“Eisenberg”), Kellie
Sibley (“Sibley”), Charla Bagzis (“Bagzis”), Jeana Zirlin (“Zirlin”), Cindy
Persky (“Persky”), and Stacey Heiny (“Heiny”) (“Moving Plaintiffs”) seek a
preliminary injunction to enjoin Defendant Counter Brands, LLC (“Counter Brands”)
from enforcing its non-solicitation clause against former consultants and
current consultants to the extent that they are soliciting other consultants
for a non-competing business.  
The court has read and considered the moving papers,
opposition, and reply, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of the Case
1. Complaint
Plaintiffs filed this action on February 9, 2024 against
Defendant Counter Brands for declaratory relief and tortious interference with
prospective advantage.  The operative
pleading is the First Amended Complaint, filed on February 23, 2024, which
alleges causes of action for (1) declaratory relief,[1]
(2) injunctive relief, (3) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing, (4) unfair business practices in violation of Business and Professions
Code section 17200, (5) promissory estoppel, (6) unjust enrichment, (7)
fraudulent misrepresentation, (8) breach of implied contract, and (9) breach of
contract. The FAC alleges in pertinent part as follows.
Defendant Counter Brands, dba Beautycounter, is a
multi-level marketing company, headquartered at 1733 Ocean Avenue #325, Santa
Monica, California.  FAC ¶¶ 1-2.  Beautycounter has since its inception
unilaterally imposed non-solicitation policies on its Consultants.  FAC ¶¶ 4-5.
Plaintiffs Culver, Guardia, Eisenberg, Sibley, Bagzis,
Zirlin, Persky, Heiny, Paige Calla (“Calla”), Ruby Garcia (“Garcia”), Renee
Hill (“Hill”), Staci Kalvaitis (“Kalvaitis”), Michelle Lilly (“Lilly”), Gina
Quattrochi (“Quattrochi”), Carrie Smith (“Smith”), Rikki Miller (“Miller”),
Darcy Ivanans (“Ivanans”), (“consultants”) became Beautycounter consultants
between the years of 2013 and 2019.  FAC
¶¶ 24-25, 27-28, 33-34, 38-39, 42-43, 47-48, 51-52, 55-56, 58-59, 61-62, 65-66,
68-69, 71-72, 75-76, 78-79, and 81-82. 
Consultants found out that they were subject to non-solicitation
restrictions after Beautycounter implemented a unilateral cut in commissions in
2022.  FAC ¶9.  Consultants dependent on Beautycounter
commissions were subjected to pay cuts of up to 70%.  FAC ¶9. 
Consultants began looking for alternative ways to supplement their
income and found additional products to sell through other multi-level
marketing (“MLM”) companies while still working with Beautycounter.  FAC ¶¶ 10-11.
In response, Beautycounter falsely told some Consultants
that they were prohibited from selling products for another MLM company,
despite there being no such restriction in the Consultant Agreement or in the
policies and procedures.  FAC ¶13.  Beautycounter’s management also had
individual meetings with top-earning consultants to interrogate them about
their attempts to supplement their incomes and threatened discipline to stop
them from selling products for any other MLM company.  FAC ¶14. 
Further, Beautycounter falsely accused many top-earning consultants of
“soliciting” their recruited consultants in their downlines for other MLM
companies.  FAC ¶15.  As a result, Beautycounter suspended, froze,
and cut-off the consultants from their businesses overnight.  FAC ¶15. 
Beautycounter conducted sham investigations, took credit for
consultants’ sales, refused to interview consultants as part of the
investigations, and terminated consultants for purported breaches of the
non-solicitation restrictions.  FAC
¶16.  Beautycounter sent threatening
letters to former consultants, directing them to comply with the unlawful
non-solicitation policies or risk being sued by Beautycounter.  FAC ¶18.
Plaintiffs Guardia, Eisenberg, Kalvaitis, Culver, Sibley,
Zirlin, Bagzis, Persky, and Heiny are under immediate threat of enforcement of
the non-solicitation policy.  FAC
¶21.  Plaintiffs Guardia, Bagzis, Sibley,
Zirlin, and Persky are still Beautycounter consultants but currently
suspended.  FAC ¶ 21.  Plaintiffs Culver, Eisenberg, Kalvaitis, and
Heiny were recently terminated or resigned and are within the purported
one-year non-solicitation term.  FAC ¶
21. 
Plaintiffs Calla, Hill, Lilly, Quattrochi, Smith, Miller,
and Ivanans are no longer subject to the one-year non-solicitation policy.  However, they struggle to build comparable
businesses outside of Beautycounter without the ability to leverage their own
networks.  FAC ¶ 22.
Plaintiffs seeks a declaration that (1) the non-solicitation
policy is invalid as a matter of California law under Business and Professions
Code section 16600 and (2) Plaintiffs are not bound by any arbitration
provision in any purported agreement with Beautycounter.  FAC at 52.
Plaintiffs also seeks an injunction prohibiting
Beautycounter from using, relying on, or threatening enforcement of the
non-solicitation policy, an award of compensatory and punitive damages,
attorney’s fees allowed by law, costs, prejudgment interest, and other relief
deemed just and proper.  FAC at 52-53. 
 
2. Course of Proceedings
Defendant Counter Brands filed a Notice of Appearance on
March 15, 2024. 
On March 14, 2024, the court issued a temporary restraining
order (“TRO”) and issued an order to show cause (“OSC”) against Counter Brands.
 
B. Applicable Law
An injunction is a writ or order requiring a person to
refrain from a particular act; it may be granted by the court in which the
action is brought, or by a judge thereof; and when granted by a judge, it may
be enforced as an order of the court. 
CCP §525.  An injunction may be
more completely defined as a writ or order commanding a person either to
perform or to refrain from performing a particular act.  See Comfort v. Comfort, (1941)
17 Cal.2d 736, 741. McDowell v. Watson, (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1155, 1160.[2]  It is an equitable remedy available generally
in the protection or to prevent the invasion of a legal right.  Meridian, Ltd. v. City and County of San
Francisco, et al., (1939) 13 Cal.2d 424.
The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status
quo pending final resolution upon a trial. 
See Scaringe v. J.C.C. Enterprises, Inc., (1988) 205
Cal.App.3d 1536. Grothe v. Cortlandt Corp., (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1313,
1316; Major v. Miraverde Homeowners Assn., (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 618,
623.  The status quo has been
defined to mean the last actual peaceable, uncontested status which preceded
the pending controversy.  Voorhies v.
Greene (1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 989, 995, quoting United Railroads v.
Superior Court, (1916) 172 Cal. 80, 87. 14859 Moorpark
Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT Corp., (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402.
A preliminary injunction is issued after hearing on a
noticed motion.  The complaint normally
must plead injunctive relief.  CCP
§526(a)(1)-(2).[3]  Preliminary injunctive relief requires the
use of competent evidence to create a sufficient factual showing on the grounds
for relief.  See e.g. Ancora-Citronelle
Corp. v. Green, (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 146, 150.  Injunctive relief may be granted based on a
verified complaint only if it contains sufficient evidentiary, not ultimate,
facts.  See CCP §527(a).  For this reason, a pleading alone rarely
suffices.  Weil & Brown, California
Procedure Before Trial, 9:579, 9(ll)-21 (The Rutter Group 2007).  The burden of proof is on the plaintiff as
moving party.  O’Connell v. Superior
Court, (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1481. 
A plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must show the absence
of an adequate damages remedy at law. 
CCP §526(4); Thayer Plymouth Center, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors,
(1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 300, 307; Department of Fish & Game v. Anderson-Cottonwood
Irrigation Dist., (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1554, 1565.  The concept of “inadequacy of the legal
remedy” or “inadequacy of damages” dates from the time of the early courts of
chancery, the idea being that an injunction is an unusual or extraordinary
equitable remedy which will not be granted if the remedy at law (usually
damages) will adequately compensate the injured plaintiff.  Department of Fish & Game v.
Anderson-Cottonwood Irrigation Dist., (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1554, 1565.
In determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction,
the trial court considers two factors: (1) the reasonable probability that the
plaintiff will prevail on the merits at trial (CCP §526(a)(1)), and (2) a
balancing of the “irreparable harm” that the plaintiff is likely to sustain if
the injunction is denied as compared to the harm that the defendant is likely
to suffer if the court grants a preliminary injunction.  CCP §526(a)(2); 14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s
Assn. v. VRT Corp., (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402; Pillsbury, Madison
& Sutro v. Schectman, (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1283; Davenport v.
Blue Cross of California, (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 435, 446; Abrams v. St.
Johns Hospital, (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 628, 636.  Thus, a preliminary injunction may not issue
without some showing of potential entitlement to such relief.  Doe v. Wilson, (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th
296, 304.  The decision to grant a
preliminary injunction generally lies within the sound discretion of the trial
court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.  Thornton v. Carlson, (1992) 4
Cal.App.4th 1249, 1255.
A preliminary injunction ordinarily cannot take effect
unless and until the plaintiff provides an undertaking for damages which the
enjoined defendant may sustain by reason of the injunction if the court finally
decides that the plaintiff was not entitled to the injunction.  See CCP §529(a); City of South San
Francisco v. Cypress Lawn Cemetery Assn., (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 916, 920.
 
C. Governing Law
Non-competition covenants are disfavored under the law, and
those that purport to restrict the ability of a person to practice his or her
profession are invalid in the absence of a statutory exception.  Business and Professions Code[4]
§16600; Edwards v. Arthur Andersen LLP, “Edwards”) (2008) 44
Cal.4th 937, 942, 948.  Section 16600
declares that, except as provided in other statutory exceptions, such
agreements are void as a matter of public policy.  Thus, covenants not to compete generally are
not enforceable in California by injunction or otherwise.  Dowell v. Biosense Webster, Inc.,
(2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 564, 575. 
Even though an employee’s contractual agreement not to solicit an
employer’s customers is not enforceable under B&P section 16600, the court
may still enjoin tortious conduct as violation of trade secret law or as unfair
competition under B&P section 17200. 
The Retirement Group v. Galante, (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th
1226, 1238-41. 
Section 16601 contains an exception for non-competition
agreements entered into as part of a business owner’s sale of his or her
ownership interest or a company’s sale of all or substantially all of its
assets.  See Edwards, supra,
34 Cal.4th at 945-46.  The reason for
the exception is to prevent the seller from depriving the buyer of the full
value of its acquisition, including the sold company’s goodwill.  Alliant Insurance Services Inc. v. Gaddy,
(2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 1292, 1301.  Where
goodwill is sold with a business, it is unfair for the seller to engage in
competition which diminishes the value of the goodwill asset.  Monogram Industries, Inc. v. SAR
Industries, Inc., (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 692, 698.  “The sold business’s goodwill is the
‘expectation of ... that patronage which has become an asset of the
business.’”  Alliant supra,
159 Cal.App.4th at 1302 (citing Strategix, Ltd. v. Infocrossing West, Inc.
(2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1073).  
The courts will not attempt to construe a covenant not to
compete narrowly in an attempt to save a statutorily proscribed and void
provision.  D’Sa v. Playhut, Inc.,
(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 927, 935.
Section 16600 does not invalidate an employee’s agreement
not to solicit former co-workers.  Loral
Corp. v. Moyes, (1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 268, 276-77.  The co-workers may not be restrained from
moving to the competitor; enforcement of an agreement not to raid a former
employer simply prevents the former employee from contacting them first.  Id. at 279.  Enforcement of such an agreement provides an
employer with assurance of a stable work force, has no overall negative impact
on trade or business, and is not void on its face under B&P Code section
16600.  Id. at 280.  Compare AMN Healthcare, Inc. v. Aya
Healthcare Services, Inc., (“AMN”) (2018) 298 Cal.Ap.5th
923, 951-52 (concluding that non-solicitation provision for employees was
unenforceable under section 16600).
 
D. Statement of Facts
1. Moving Plaintiffs’
Evidence
Moving Plaintiffs
were either suspended, forced to resign, terminated, or currently suspended
from Beautycounter for alleged violations of a Non-Solicitation Policy embedded
in Beautycounter’s Policies and Procedures. 
Bagzis Decl. ¶ 2; Persky Decl. ¶ 2; Heiny Decl. ¶ 2; Guardia Decl. ¶ 2;
Culver Decl. ¶ 2; Sibley Decl. ¶ 2; Eisenberg Decl. ¶ 2; and Zirlin Decl. ¶ 2.  Plaintiffs Medina did not see nor sign the
Non-Solicitation Policy.  Bagzis Decl. ¶
2; Persky Decl. ¶ 2; Heiny Decl. ¶ 2; Guardia Decl. ¶ 2; Culver Decl. ¶ 2;
Sibley Decl. ¶ 2; Eisenberg Decl. ¶ 2; and Zirlin Decl. ¶ 2.   Moving Plaintiffs were not involved in
reviewing, negotiating, or discussing the terms of a non-solicitation policy
with Beautycounter at any point.  Bagzis
Decl. ¶ 2; Persky Decl. ¶ 2; Heiny Decl. ¶ 2; Guardia Decl. ¶ 2; Culver Decl. ¶
2; Sibley Decl. ¶ 2; Eisenberg Decl. ¶ 2; and Zirlin Decl. ¶ 2.   Moving Plaintiffs were only made aware of
this policy after they already started working with other multi-level marketing
(“MLM”) companies.  Bagzis Decl. ¶ 2;
Persky Decl. ¶ 2; Heiny Decl. ¶ 2; Guardia Decl. ¶ 2; Culver Decl. ¶ 2; Sibley
Decl. ¶ 2; Eisenberg Decl. ¶ 2; and Zirlin Decl. ¶ 2.
Moving Plaintiffs would
not have joined Beautycounter had they known Beautycounter would try to prevent
them from leveraging their own network for other MLM businesses.  Bagzis Decl. ¶ 3; Persky Decl. ¶ 3; Heiny
Decl. ¶ 3; Guardia Decl. ¶ 3; Culver Decl. ¶ 3; Sibley Decl. ¶ 3; Eisenberg
Decl. ¶ 3; and Zirlin Decl. ¶ 3.  Most
independent consultants represent multiple MLM companies.  Bagzis Decl. ¶ 3; Persky Decl. ¶ 3; Heiny
Decl. ¶ 3; Guardia Decl. ¶ 3; Culver Decl. ¶ 3; Sibley Decl. ¶ 3; Eisenberg
Decl. ¶ 3; and Zirlin Decl. ¶ 3.
Moving Plaintiffs
have not been provided with any evidence by Beautycounter supporting their
allegations that they breached the non-solicitation policy.  Bagzis Decl. ¶ 4; Persky Decl. ¶ 4; Heiny
Decl. ¶ 4; Guardia Decl. ¶ 4; Culver Decl. ¶ 4; Sibley Decl. ¶ 4; Eisenberg
Decl. ¶ 4; and Zirlin Decl. ¶ 4.
Since the
suspensions, Moving Plaintiffs have been cut-off from their website, customers,
downline, and all information relating to their Beautycounter businesses.  Bagzis Decl. ¶ 5; Persky Decl. ¶ 5; Heiny
Decl. ¶ 5; Guardia Decl. ¶ 5; Culver Decl. ¶ 5; Sibley Decl. ¶ 5; Eisenberg
Decl. ¶ 5; and Zirlin Decl. ¶ 5.  Moving Plaintiffs
also received checks from Beautycounter that do not reflect what their
commissions should be for the sales Beautycounter has received from their
customers and downline since their suspensions. 
Bagzis Decl. ¶ 6; Persky Decl. ¶ 6; Heiny Decl. ¶ 6; Guardia Decl. ¶ 6;
Culver Decl. ¶ 6; Sibley Decl. ¶ 6; Eisenberg Decl. ¶ 6; and Zirlin Decl. ¶ 6.  The suspension, forced resignation, and/or
terminations have imposed significant hardships on Moving Plaintiffs since they
are prevented from generating the level of sales they would typically
generate.  Bagzis Decl. ¶¶ 7-8; Persky
Decl. ¶¶ 7-8; Heiny Decl. ¶¶ 7-8; Guardia Decl. ¶¶ 7-8; Culver Decl. ¶¶ 7-8;
Sibley Decl. ¶¶ 7-8; Eisenberg Decl. ¶¶ 7-8; and Zirlin Decl. ¶¶ 7-8.  
The MLM industry
requires independent consultants to leverage their personal networks to recruit
people to sell under them in addition to selling the products/services directly
to customers to build their business and commission streams.  Bagzis Decl. ¶ 9; Persky Decl. ¶ 9; Heiny
Decl. ¶ 9; Guardia Decl. ¶ 9; Culver Decl. ¶ 9; Sibley Decl. ¶ 9; Eisenberg
Decl. ¶ 9; and Zirlin Decl. ¶ 9. 
Beautycounter’s threats to enforce the non-solicitation policy are
impeding Moving Plaintiffs’ ability to recruit for their new businesses, make
commissions in their new roles, continues to damage their professional
reputations, and impeding on their ability to earn a living in their chosen
profession.  Bagzis Decl. ¶¶ 10-11; Persky
Decl. ¶¶ 10-11; Heiny Decl. ¶¶ 10-11; Guardia Decl. ¶¶ 10-11; Culver Decl. ¶¶
10-11; Sibley Decl. ¶¶ 10-11; Eisenberg Decl. ¶¶ 10-11; and Zirlin Decl. ¶¶
10-11.
 
2. Counter Brand’s
Evidence
Beautycounter sells a variety of safer and clean beauty
products such as skincare, haircare, body care, cosmetics, and fragrances.  Rollin Decl. ¶ 3.  Beautycounter operates, in part, MLM company,
where independent contractors known as “Brand Advocates” enter into consultant
agreements with Beautycounter to sell its products to consumers.  Rollin Decl. ¶ 4.  Beautycounter also sells its products through
other channels, including its own retail stores, own website, and strategic
partnerships, including with Ulta Beauty. 
Rollin Decl. ¶ 4.  Beautycounter’s
Brand Advocates are crucial to its success and drive the majority of
Beautycounter’s revenue.  Rollin Decl. ¶
5.  Like other MLM companies,
Beautycounter compensates Brand Advocates for their sales and sales their
downline members generate.  Rollin Decl.
¶ 6.  
Beautycounter also competes with other MLM companies not
only for product sales but for independent contractors to make those sales.  Rollin Decl. ¶ 7.  The Companies that Beautycounter considers
competitors at the product level include Olive Tree People and Green Compass,
which are both MLM companies that sell many products that compete with
Beautycounter products.  Rollin Decl. ¶
8.  For instance, both Beautycounter and Olive
Tree People sell skin care products including serums, toners, cleansers, face
masks, and more, as well as shampoo. 
Rollin Decl. ¶ 9.  Similarly, both
Beautycounter and Green Compass sell a wide variety of skin care products
including serums, body oils, creams, and more. 
Rollin Decl. ¶ 10.  For example, Beautycounter's
highest-selling product is a Vitamin C serum, and Green Compass offers a
competing Vitamin C serum.  Rollin Decl.
¶ 10.
 
E. Analysis
Moving Plaintiffs seek a
preliminary injunction precluding Defendant Counter Brands from enforcing its
non-solicitation clause against former consultants and current consultants to
the extent that they are soliciting other consultants for a non-competing
business.  
Although Moving Plaintiffs argue
that they never agreed to the non-solicitation clause (Supp Mem. at 11-14), the
court will assume, arguendo, that they did for purposes of this
application.
 
1. Mootness as to Former Consultants
Counter
Brands states that it does not intend to enforce its non-solicitation policy
against former consultants. 
Accordingly, a preliminary injunction to prevent such enforcement is
unnecessary.  See Madrid v. Perot Sys. Corp., (2005) 130
Cal. App. 4th 440, 463 (“Injunctive relief is appropriate only when there is a
threat of continuing misconduct.”).  Opp.
at 11, n. 4.
Petitioners are skeptical about this representation and argue that
Counter Brands has continued to threaten to enforce its illegal
non-solicitation policy against former consultants even after the TRO was
entered.   On April 17, 2024, Counter
Brands summarily fired swaths of consultants as part of its founder’s buyback
of the company from the private equity company that purchased a majority
interest in 2021.  In an April 17
termination email from the CEO and founder of Counter Brands, Gregg Renfrew, a
consultant was informed: “As a reminder, you remain
bound by all post-termination obligations under the Brand Advocate
Agreement….”  Bures Decl., Ex. A.    The consultant was never told, before or after
receipt of this email, that her “post-termination obligations” no longer
included the non-solicitation restriction Counter Brands expressly threatened
to enforce against Plaintiffs, which has been enjoined by this Court.  Id., ¶5.  Reply at 2-23.  
Injunctive relief in favor of Moving Plaintiffs who are former
consultants is not mooted.
 
2. Probability of Success
Under Section 16600, all covenants not to compete – including
non-solicitation covenants – are void absent an express statutory exception.  See Kelton v. Stravinski, (“Kelton”)
(2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 941, 946. 
Sections 16601 and 16602 permit covenants not to compete in two narrow
situations: where a person sells the goodwill of a business and where a partner
agrees not to complete in anticipation of dissolution of a partnership.  Id.[5]  Covenants not to compete in contracts other
than for either the sale of goodwill or dissolution of a partnership are
void.  Ibid.  California courts have read an exception into
the statute for in-term non-solicitation restrictions on employees. See,
e.g., Techno Lite, Inc. v. Emcod, LLC, (“Techno Lite”) (2020)
44 Cal.App.5th 462, 471. The justification for this exception stems from the
employee’s implied duty of loyalty owed to their employer.  Id.
Counter Brands argues that California law generally recognizes that the
limitations of section 16600 apply only after
an employee or independent contractor is no longer in an employment or
contractor relationship.  See Techno
Lite, supra, 44 Cal. App. 5th at 471 (“[Section 16600] does not affect limitations on
an employee’s conduct or duties while employed.”) (emphasis in
original)); Angelica Textile Servs.,
Inc. v. Park, (“Angelica”) (2013) 220 Cal. App. 4th 495, 509
(“[S]ection 16600 has consistently been interpreted as invalidating any
employment agreement that unreasonably interferes with an employee’s ability to
compete with an employer after his or her employment ends.”) (emphasis
in original)).  Opp. at 11.
Thus, businesses are generally free to enforce non-solicitation clauses
against current employees.  Techno Lite, supra, 44 Cal. App.
5th at 473 (“Appellants do not cite – and we have not found – a single case in
which Section 16600 was held to invalidate
an agreement not to compete with one’s current employer while employed by that
employer.”).  “The public policy
behind Section 16600 is to ensure ‘that every citizen shall retain the right to
pursue any lawful employment and enterprise of their choice’ [Citation.] and to
encourage open competition and employee mobility [Citation.]; it is not to
immunize employees who undermine their employer by competing with it while
still employed.”  Id.
The problem with Counter Brands’ argument is that its current consultants
are independent contractors, not employees. 
By their nature, independent contractors owe no duties to their contract
partner outside the duties assigned in their contract and any contract-related
duties implied by law (i.e., the implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing).  Unlike an employee, the
current consultants owe no contract duty of loyalty which is the very basis of
the court-created exception to section 16600 for non-solicitation restrictions
on employees.  See Techno Lite,
supra, 44 Cal.App.5th at 471.[6]
Moving Plaintiffs rely on case law holding that in-term covenants not to
compete for non-employees have been held invalid under section 16600.  Supp. Mem. at 6-7.
In Kelton v. Stravinski, two partners entered a covenant not to
directly compete with the partnership’s warehouse development business during
the lifetime of the partnership, although the partners were otherwise free to
conduct other “competitive real estate activities.” 138 Cal.App.4th at 944–45.  The Fifth District Court of Appeals found that
the covenant not to compete did not fall within the two statutory exceptions to
section 16600. “The covenant not to compete violates California's public policy
of open competition and therefore is unenforceable.” Id. at 947.  The Kelton court expressly rejected
the plaintiff’s argument that “the covenant not to compete is valid because the
parties were involved in an ongoing business relationship.” Id. 
In a New York federal district case, FaZe Clan Inc. v. Tenney,
(S.D.N.Y. 2020) 467 F.Supp.3d 180, 187, an independent contractor (Tenney) asserted
that the non-compete restrictions in his contract with a video game promoter (FaZe
Clan) were invalid under section 16600.  The district court distinguished Techno
Lite and Agenlica as cases in which a current employee sought to
invoke section 16600.  Id. at 188.
 Outside of the current employee context,
“state and federal courts applying California law typically hold that § 16600
does bar in-term
agreements not to compete.” Id. (citing Kelton, supra, 138 Cal.App.4th at 941.  The district court pointed out that the Ninth
Circuit, in a non-precedential decision, “relied on Kelton
to hold that §16600
barred an in-term
non-compete provision in a contract between two independent contractors, a filmmaker and an actor.” Id.
(citing ITN Flix, LLC v. Hinojosa, (“ITN Flix”) (9th
Cir. 2017) 686 Fed.App'x 441 (memorandum).  While ITN Flix was not binding, the
district court believed it to be “strong persuasive authority” that was “consistent
with the reasoning of Techno Lite that the exception for
employer-employee contracts relates to the unique attributes of the employment
relationship, i.e., the fact that during the term of employment, an employer is
entitled to its employees’ undivided loyalty.” Id.  The district court further found this result
and reasoning consistent with the California Supreme Court’s instruction that “section 16600
represents a strong public policy of the state which should not be diluted by
judicial fiat.” Id. (citing Edwards, supra,
44 Cal. 4th at 949).  Supp. Mem. at 7.
Counter Brands distinguishes Kelton, supra, 138 Cal. App.
4th at 941, as dealing with a non-competition provision, not a non-solicitation
clause (id. at 946-47) and a partnership, for which the covenant
not to compete did not come within any exceptions to the general rule that such
covenants are void (id. at 944). 
Similarly, FaZe Clan Inc. v. Tenney, supra, 467 F. Supp.
3d at 187-88 is inapposite because it involved a non-compete rather than a
non-solicit.  Id. at 187-88.  Moving Plaintiffs have cited no case law
endorsing the idea that independent contractors must be allowed to poach a
company’s employees or other independent contractors while actively working for
that company.[7]
Counter Brands’s distinction of Kelton and FaZe Clan Inc. v.
Tenney on the ground that they concern covenants not to compete as opposed
to non-solicitation restraints is ineffectual.  
Both are analyzed the same way.  See
Edwards, supra,
44 Cal. 4th at 955 (holding non-solicitation provision invalid, as it would
non-competition agreement, under section 16600 unless it fell within the
applicable statutory exceptions of sections 16601, 16602, or 16602.5.”).
Counter Brands points to Youngevity International, Corp. v. Smith,
(“Youngevity”) (S.D. Cal. Dec. 1, 2016) 224 F. Supp. 3d 1022, 1032,
in which a federal district court enforced a non-solicitation agreement against
an independent contractor working for an MLM as an exception to section 16600’s
general prohibition.  Opp. at 12.
The Youngevity district court did not mention Kelton and
stated that it did not believe “it is proper to make such a distinction”
between independent contractors and employees because unlike a restraint that
operates for a period after a business relationship expires, an independent
contractor can simply cease the business relationship with to whom the covenant
runs.  224
F.Supp. 3d at 1032.  While this
statement is true, Youngevity ignores California law that all restraints
are void absent one of the three statutory exceptions or the court-created
exception for employees based on the duty of loyalty.  Edwards, supra, 44 Cal. 4th at 955.  A non-solicitation restraint on independent
contractors does not fall within a statutory exception to section 16600 and the
weight of case law on the issue shows neither is there a judicial carve-out
validating such a provision.  Counter
Brands’s policy violates California public policy and section 16600 for both
former and current consultants.
 
3. Competing Businesses
Counter Brands attempts to save its non-solicitation policy by arguing
that it only applies to other MLMs that compete with Counter Brands for a sales
force.  Moving Plaintiffs concede that
they are seeking to be released from their non-solicitation obligations so that
they can poach Counter Brands consultants for businesses that sell competing
products.  Opp. at 14.
Counter Brands argues that the court indicated at the TRO/OSC hearing
that a non-solicitation provision would be enforceable to prevent a current Counter
Brands consultant from recruiting other consultants to join competing
businesses.  However, the court refrained
from defining a “competing business”. 
Counter Brands argues that its competing businesses include not only MLM
companies that sell similar products as Counter Brands, but also MLM companies,
in general, which compete for a sales force of independent contractors.  Opp. at 12.
Moving Plaintiffs concede that MLM companies are part of a unique “MLM
industry” in which each company and consultant competes to build a sales force.  Bagzis
Decl., ¶9; see also Guardia Decl.,
¶9 (same); Eisenberg Decl., ¶9 (same); Persky Decl., ¶9 (same); Zirlin Decl., ¶9 (same); Sibley Decl., ¶9 (same); Heiny Decl., ¶9 (same); Culver Decl., ¶9 (same).  Indeed, courts have recognized that the MLM
business model (in which sales take place through independent contractors)
means that all MLM companies compete with one another to develop and maintain
an effective sales force.  PartyLite Gifts, Inc. v. MacMillan, (“PartyLite
Gifts”) (M.D. Fla. 2012) 895 F. Supp. 2d 1213, 1228  (“PartyLite [MLM that sells candles and
related home products] and Park Lane [MLM that sells jewelry] are competitors
in that they compete for salespeople by offering competitive income opportunities
under similar, albeit not identical, compensation schemes.”); see also Pre-Paid Legal Servs., Inc. v. Cahill, (E.D.
Okla. (2013) 924 F. Supp. 2d 1281, 1290-91 (granting injunction to prevent
former independent contractor of plaintiff MLM company selling legal services
plans from recruiting its current contractors to join another MLM company
selling skincare).  As a result, the mere
fact that “[MLM] companies may sell different products does not mandate the
conclusion that they are neither similar nor competitive.”  PartyLite
Gifts, supra, 895 F. Supp. 2d at 1228.  Counter Brands’s non-solicitation policy is
properly tailored to extend only to other MLM companies, which are part of one
competitive industry.  Opp. at 12-13.
Moving Plaintiffs reply that Counter Brands’s reliance on competition for
sales force, and not products, is untenable. 
Its definition of “competitor” includes any “network marketing,
multilevel marketing, party plan or social media company that sells products or
services through independent sales representatives.”  Dattilo Decl., Ex. B, §12.  In other words, Counter Brands wants to
restrain recruitment for companies that sell in the same manner rather than
those that sell directly competitive products.  Yet, Counter Brands’s leaders actually promote
competing products, suggesting they are not concerned about product
competition, only about people competition.  Counter Brands’s founder and CEO has several
times promoted other beauty and skin care brands on her personal Instagram,
promoting them side-by-side with Counter Brands.  Hill Decl., Ex. A.  The company’s Instagram page, too, has posted
several times praising other beauty and skin care brands.  Id., Ex. B.  Counter Brands never explains why it and its CEO
can promote other skincare products, but it is a contractually fatal offense
for consultants to recruit other Counter Brands consultants to do the same.  Reply at 4-5.
The court accepts Counter Brands’ argument that it competes with other
MLM companies for a sales force.  But
that fact does not affect the unlawfulness of its non-solicitation clause under
section 16600.  Nor does it affect the
scope of the preliminary injunction.  The
OSC does not apply to current consultants soliciting other consultants for
competing businesses, but the court will not include competition for
consultants in its use of the term competing business, only competition for
products.  See post.
Counter Brands further argues that Moving Plaintiffs all seek to solicit Counter
Brands’s existing consultants to join MLM ventures that sell directly competing
products.  Moving Plaintiffs argue that
they should be able to recruit Counter Brands’s consultants to join either
Olive Tree People or Green Compass.  See
Bagzis Decl., ¶¶ 9-10; Culver Decl., ¶¶ 9-10; Eisenberg Decl., ¶¶ 9-10; Heiny Decl., ¶¶ 9-10; Guardia Decl., ¶¶ 9-10; Persky Decl., ¶¶ 9-10; Sibley Decl., ¶¶ 9-10; Zirlin Decl., ¶¶ 9-10.  These two companies offer products that
directly compete against Counter Brands’s products.  See Rollin
Decl., ¶¶ 8-10.  Olive Tree People and
Green Compass each sell skincare products, just as Counter Brands does.  Rollin
Decl., ¶¶ 9-10.  Moving Plaintiffs have
not identified any current consultant who is seeking to recruit other consultants
to join an MLM company that sells unrelated products.  Opp. at 13.
Moving Plaintiffs reply that Green Compass and Oliveda both sell some
skin care products, but it is a stretch to say they are competing for the same
market share as Counter Brands.  These
two brands sell only a few overlapping products with Counter Brands.  Hill Decl., ¶¶ 5–6; Bagzis Decl., ¶¶ 4–5.  Green Compass is a hemp and CBD-based products
company focused on internal wellness and pain relief.  Hill Decl., ¶¶ 3–4.   Just three of Green Compass’s products could
even be considered facial skin care products. Unlike Counter Brands, Green
Compass does not sell cosmetics.  Hill
Decl., ¶6.  Oliveda also does not sell
cosmetics and sells only olive tree-based products in skincare, elixirs, teas,
olive oils, and shampoo. Bagzis Decl., ¶4.  Reply at 5.
Further, independent contractors can and do successfully sell for
multiple companies simultaneously.  Plaintiff
Bagzis sold Oliveda and Counter Brands products before her suspension, and
recruited teams for those businesses, without her Counter Brands business being
negatively affected.  Bagzis Decl.,
¶¶6–7.  Counter Brands’s definition of
“competitor” is overbroad, nonsensical, and unnecessary to prevent harm to Counter
Brands.  Reply at 5-6.
The court will exclude Green Compass and Oliveda from the term competing
business as they have not been shown to sufficiently compete with Counter
Brands.
 
4. Balancing of Irreparable Harms
Moving Plaintiffs argue that they are currently subject to
great and irreparable harm if Counter Brands is not enjoined from enforcing its
unlawful policy.  
Moving Plaintiffs are suffering financial
losses from the non-solicitation clause.  While money damages may compensate for some
financial harm, “[i]rreparable harm” does not mean “injury beyond the
possibility of repair or beyond possible compensation in damages.”  Donahue Schriber Realty Grp. v. Nu Creation
Outreach, (2014) 232 Cal. App. 4th 1171, 1184 (citation omitted).  Certain types of monetary damages become irreparable, particularly
when a plaintiff is unable to work.  Where
the likely harm is  lost wages and the
ability to meet family needs, there may be irreparable harm.  Ex Parte App.
at 11.
Besides their loss of income, Moving
Plaintiffs are losing goodwill with their customers to whom they can no longer
sell.  Moving Plaintiff Decls., ¶11.
 Their reputation as salespersons is
damaged when they cannot sell to their customers.  Loss of goodwill, inability to sell to
customers, and reputational harm are each considered irreparable harm in
California. Donahue Schriber Realty Grp. v. Nu Creation Outreach, supra,
232 Cal. App. 4th at 1178.  Ex Parte
App. at 10-11.
Moving Plaintiffs argue that Counter Brands would lose little in allowing them to recruit other
consultants for other MLM opportunities. 
If Moving Plaintiffs are able to sell products and recruit sales
consultants for other companies, it would not necessarily cause Counter Brands
to lose any sales because a customer may purchase from both Counter Brands
products and another company.  Ex Parte
App. at 11-12.  Even if Counter Brands
would lose some sales or consultants,
the level of harm is minimal.  Counter
Brands is a billion-dollar company and Moving Plaintiffs are only eight out of
its more than 40,000 sales consultants. 
Finally, “a party suffers no grave or irreparable harm by being
prohibited from violating the law,” so a finding that the non-solicitation
policy violates section 16600 would preclude a finding that irreparable harm
would result if Counter Brands were not allowed to continue enforcing its
policy in violation of the law. People v. Uber Techs., Inc., (2020) 56
Cal. App. 5th 266, 305.  Ex Parte App. at
12.
Counter Brands argues that its harm from a
preliminary injunction lies in the Moving Plaintiffs’ abandonment of their duty
of loyalty.  Ex Parte Opp. at 14-15.[8]  As stated, there is no such duty shown.
The balancing of harms works in favor of a
preliminary injunction.[9]
 
5. Scope of the Preliminary
Injunction
Counter Brands argues that Moving
Plaintiffs’ contention that non-solicitation agreements may never be enforced
against independent contractors is both beyond the scope of this proceeding and
meritless.  When the court issued its TRO/OSC
against Counter Brands, it explained: “The temporary restraining order only
applies to the former employees and the order to show cause applies to the
former and also the current employees (sic.) but only
to the extent they are soliciting consultants for a non-competing business.”  Mar. 14, 2024 Minute Order (emphasis
added).  In other words, the OSC does not
encompass Counter Brands’s non-solicitation policy to the extent it applies to Counter
Brands’ current consultants working for competing companies.  Rather, the only aspect of Counter Brands’s in-term
non-solicitation policy at issue is whether it can be applied to non-competing
companies.  Opp. at 14.
Counter Brands is correct.  As stated ante, the OSC does not apply
to current consultants soliciting other consultants for competing
businesses.  However, the court does not
include competition for consultants in this reference to competing businesses,
only competition for products.  If Moving
Plaintiffs wish to increase the scope of the preliminary injunction, they will
have to move to modify it in the I/C court. 
Counter Brands also argues that Moving
Plaintiffs’ requested preliminary injunction is improperly broad because they request
a preliminary injunction that would prevent Counter Brands from enforcing its
non-solicitation policy against all persons “similarly situated” to Moving
Plaintiffs—even consultants who are not parties.  Moving Plaintiffs rely on AMN, supra,
28 Cal. App. 5th at 951-52, a case that involved a permanent injunction
imposed after a fact-intensive merits analysis. 
AMN’s permanent injunction
analysis does not apply to a preliminary injunction.  Cf. West v. Lind, (1960) 186 Cal. App. 2d 563,
565 (“The power to issue preliminary injunctions is an extraordinary one and
should be exercised with great caution and only where it appears that
sufficient cause for hasty action exists.”). 
Opp. at 19.
Even if AMN were relevant in this procedural
context, the injunction served to benefit
a party.  In that case, the plaintiff business sought to enjoin a competitor
company from enforcing a non-solicitation provision against its former
employees, including non-party former employees.  28 Cal.
App. 5th at 951–52.  In granting the permanent
injunction, the AMN court
highlighted evidence that the defendant company had tried to use the
non-solicitation provision to stop former employees from joining the plaintiff.  Id.  Thus, by preventing enforcement of the
non-solicitation provision, the AMN
injunction primarily served to prevent harm to the plaintiff business while
indirectly benefiting non-party former employees.  In contrast, Moving Plaintiffs seek an
injunction unmoored from any harm to them to the extent that they seek to
prevent Counter Brands from enforcing its non-solicitation policy against
non-parties.[10]  Opp. at 19-20.
Moving Plaintiffs
reply that the TRO/OSC, which Counter Brands agreed to in form and content,
states that Counter Brands ordered to show cause why a preliminary injunction
should not issue restraining it during the pendency of the action from “(1)
using, relying on, or threatening enforcement of its Non-Solicitation Policy
with respect to former Independent Consultants; and (2) using, relying
on, or threatening enforcement of its Non-Solicitation Policy with respect to current
Independent Consultants who seek to directly or indirectly solicit or recruit
other Counter Brands consultants for a multi-level-marketing business that does
not compete with Beautycounter.”  The OSC
is not limited to Moving Plaintiffs. 
Reply at 3.
True, but there is
no reason at a preliminary stage to enjoin Counter Brands with respect to
non-parties or Plaintiffs who have not sought a preliminary injunction.  Moving Plaintiffs have not shown any interim
harm for persons other than themselves.  That
should be a matter for the I/C court’s full consideration after trial or merits
hearing at which issues such as injunctive relief for out-of-state consultants
is considered.  
 
F.
Conclusion
The
preliminary injunction is granted for Moving Plaintiffs who are former
consultants or who are current consultants and who seek to directly or
indirectly solicit or recruit other Counter Brands consultants who work for a
MLM business that does not compete with Counter Brands in the products it
sells.
The
court must require a bond from Moving Plaintiffs. The purpose of a bond is to
cover the defendant’s damages from an improvidently issued injunction. CCP
§529(a). In setting the bond, the court must assume that the preliminary
injunction was wrongly issued. Abba Rubber Co. v. Seaquist, (“Abba“)
(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1, 15. The damages include any lost profits resulting
from the injunction. See Allen v. Pitchess, (1973) 36 Cal.App.3d
321, 327-28. The attorney’s fees necessary to successfully procure a final
decision dissolving the injunction also are damages that should be included in
setting the bond. Abba, supra, 235 Cal.App.3d at 15-16. While Abba
reasoned that the plaintiff’s likelihood of prevailing is irrelevant to setting
the bond, a more recent case disagreed, stating that the greater the likelihood
of the plaintiff prevailing, the less likely the preliminary injunction will
have been wrongly issued, and that is a relevant factor for setting the bond.  Oiye v. Fox, (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th
1036, 1062.  The bond is set at a nominal
$500.
