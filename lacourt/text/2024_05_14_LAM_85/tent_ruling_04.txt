The first and third causes of action are for declaratory relief. 


[2] The courts look to the substance of an
injunction to determine whether it is prohibitory or mandatory.  Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. v.
Superior Court, (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 709, 713.  A mandatory injunction — one that mandates a
party to affirmatively act, carries a heavy burden: “[t]he granting of a
mandatory injunction pending trial is not permitted except in extreme cases
where the right thereto is clearly established.”  Teachers Ins. & Annuity Assoc. v.
Furlotti, (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 187, 1493.


[3] However, a court may issue an injunction to
maintain the status quo without a cause of action in the complaint.  CCP §526(a)(3).

All further statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code
unless otherwise stated.

Section 16602.5 also permits a covenant not to compete where a member agrees
not to complete in anticipation of dissolution of a limited liability company. 


[6]
Moving Plaintiffs suggest that Counter Brands even allows its consultants to
sell products and services for other MLMs—including those that directly compete
with Counter Brands.  See First
Dattilo Decl., Ex. C, Sections 3F, 4C. 
Counter Brands agrees that its consultants are permitted to work for
other MLM companies and promote other products. 
Opp. at 15, n. 6.


[7]
Counter Brands correctly distinguishes two MLM cases cited by Moving
Plaintiffs: Herbalife Int’l of Am., Inc. v. Ford, (C.D. Cal. Aug. 25,
2009) 2009 WL 10668461, at *15, and Nulife Ventures, Inc. v. Avacen, Inc.,
(S.D. Cal. Dec. 11, 2020) 2020 WL 7318122, at *11.  See Supp. Mem. at 8.  Herbalife involved a plaintiff MLM
company that brought claims based upon a post-termination non-solicitation
clause against former contractors.  2009
WL 10668461, at *1, 7.  Nulife also
involved a plaintiff MLM company seeking to enforce a post-termination
non-solicitation clause against its former independent contractor sales
agent.  2020 WL 7318122, at *1, 2,
11.  Neither held that a non-solicitation
agreement involving a current independent contractor was void.  Opp. at 15, n. 7.


[8]
Counter Brands also argued that a preliminary injunction would allow Moving
Plaintiffs to have access to its proprietary information and cannibalize
consultants and sales.  Ex. Parte Opp. at
14-15.  This trade secret issue is not
within the scope of the OSC.


[9]
The court need not consider Counter Brands’ argument concerning severance
because it is unenforceable against all Moving Plaintiffs as limited by the
scope of the OSC.  Opp. at 15-17. 


[10] To the extent Moving
Plaintiffs seek an injunction that would prevent Counter Brands from seeking to
enforce the non-solicitation provision in courts outside of California, Counter
Brands argues that it must fail under Advanced
Bionics Corp. v. Medtronic, Inc., (2002) 29 Cal.4th 697.  Opp. at 20, n. 11.  Compare People ex rel. Mosk v. National Research Co., (1962) 201 Cal.App.2d 765, 776 (when a
court has personal jurisdiction over a defendant, it is immaterial that it
asserts control over the defendant’s actions outside California).
