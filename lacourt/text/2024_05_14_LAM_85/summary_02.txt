"This tentative ruling addresses the case between Key and the Association. Key filed a 24-page brief, exceeding the 15-page limit, so the court will only consider the first 15 pages. As a result, Key's arguments about the $48,464.28 cost award, the Arbitrator's refusal to allow amendment of claims, and the Arbitrator's rulings on CCP section 437c and discovery will not be considered."
