And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling by the judge addresses the dispute between Moving Plaintiffs and Counter Brands regarding the validity of a non-solicitation agreement. Moving Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief and an injunction to prevent Counter Brands from enforcing the agreement. Counter Brands argues that the agreement is valid and that the court should not issue an injunction. The judge notes that a mandatory injunction carries a heavy burden and that the court must consider the substance of the injunction. The judge also distinguishes the cases of Herbalife Int'l of Am., Inc. v. Ford and Nulife Ventures, Inc. v. Avacen, Inc., which did not hold that a non-solicitation agreement involving a current independent contractor was void. The judge finds that Counter Brands' argument concerning severance is unenforceable and that the non-solicitation agreement is valid. The judge also notes that the court need not consider Counter Brands' argument concerning enforcement of the non-solicitation provision outside of California, as it is not within the scope of the OSC.
