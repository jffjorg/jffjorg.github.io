[TENTATIVE] order RE:
plaintiff’s motion for issue and evidentiary sanctions against
  Defendant cedars-sinai medical center



 
Procedural
Background
On March 23,
2022, Plaintiff Kristina Holman (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant wrongful
termination action against Defendants Kerlan-Jobe Surgery Center, LLC,
Kerlan-Jobe, LLC, Cedars-Sinai Kerlan Jobe Institute, and Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center.  On April 28, 2022, Plaintiff
filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants
Kerlan-Jobe Surgery Center, LLC, Kerlan-Jobe, LLC, Cedars-Sinai Kerlan Jobe
Institute,[1]
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Cedar Sinai Medical Care Foundation, and Kerlan-Jobe
Orthopaedic Clinic, a Medical Group Inc. 
The FAC asserts eleven causes of action for (1) Retaliation in violation
of Labor Code § 1102.5, (2) Retaliation in violation of Labor Code § 232.5, (3)
Retaliation in violation of Health & Safety Code § 1278.5, (4)
Discrimination on the Basis of Age in violation of the Fair Employment and
Housing Act (“FEHA”), (5) Discrimination on the Basis of Disability in
violation of FEHA, (6) Failure to Prevent Discrimination in violation of FEHA,
(7) Retaliation in violation of FEHA, (8) Failure to Prevent Retaliation in
violation of FEHA, (9) Failure to Accommodate in violation of FEHA, (10)
Failure to Engage in a Good Faith Interactive Process in violation of FEHA, and
(11) Wrongful Termination in violation of Public Policy.
On December 8,
2023, Plaintiff filed the instant amended motion for issue and evidentiary
sanctions against Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (“CSMC”).  On January 17, 2024, Defendant CSMC filed an
opposition.  On January 23, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a reply.
 
Allegations of the
Operative Complaint
            The
FAC alleges that:
            Kerlan-Jobe
Surgery Center, LLC, Kerlan-Jobe, LLC, and Cedars-Sinai Kerlan-Jobe Institute (collectively
“Kerlan-Jobe”) are a network of Orthopedic surgery centers and clinics founded
by Doctors Robert Kerlan and Frank Jobe and mainly focused on select sports
injuries.  (FAC ¶¶ 13-16.)  
            Plaintiff
worked with Dr. Jobe for seven years at Centinela Hospital before being
recruited to join Kerlan-Jobe in 1997. 
(FAC ¶ 17.)  After both Dr. Kerlan
and Dr. Jobe passed away, under new leadership Kerlan-Jobe increased its case
load and expanded its portfolio of services to include pediatric orthopedics,
total hip, and other services.  (FAC ¶¶
22-23.)  
“Kerlan-Jobe
partnered with Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Department of Orthopedics, to
expand and/or establish a network of surgery centers and clinics launching the
Cedars Sinai Kerlan-Jobe Institute.” 
(FAC ¶ 24.)  
“Dr. Neal S.
ElAttrache took over Dr. Jobe’s patients.” 
(FAC ¶ 27.)  “His surgeries were
substantially delayed because he overbooked himself.”  (FAC ¶ 28.) 
“To mitigate the appearance of long delays, Dr. ElAttrache regularly
brought patients into the operating room and put them under total, general
anesthesia long before the actual surgery began.”  (FAC ¶ 29.) 
“Dr. ElAttrache would abandon his patients for long periods of time
sometimes upwards to around an hour or so to handle post-operation matters for
other patients and/or his phone calls.” 
(FAC ¶ 34.)  “All the while, his
patients were needlessly exposed to general anesthesia and associated risks,
charged for unnecessary medical care, and remained in the operating room until
Dr. ElAttrache decided to return.”  (FAC
¶ 35.)  “This practice delayed the
remaining surgeries scheduled for the day and forced surgery technicians to
work late.”  (FAC ¶ 36.)  “[Plaintiff] and others objected to Dr.
ElAttrache’s practices out of concern for patient care and because they felt
overwhelmed to no avail.”  (FAC ¶ 38.)
In the summer of
2020, when Plaintiff was in her late 50s, management began pressuring Plaintiff
to resign based on her age.  (FAC ¶¶ 42-44.)  “Trudy Wiig, the Administrator of the Surgery
Center, asked [Plaintiff] whether she was willing to work part-time because of
her age. The request was motivated by ageism. Ms. Wiig said words to the effect
that [Plaintiff]’s name came up during a Board Meeting and they were concerned
that in her old age she would not be able to keep up.”  (FAC ¶ 44.) 
However, Plaintiff declined, expressing her design to keep working and
regularly working overtime.  (FAC ¶
45.)  
Trudy Wiig then
asked Plaintiff to consider accepting a severance package from Defendants in
exchange for early retirement, which Plaintiff also declined.  (FAC ¶¶ 47-48.)  “The next day, Kevin Bowdry, the Director of
Nursing, asked [Plaintiff] to consider Ms. Wiig’s offers. [Plaintiff]
refused.”  (FAC ¶ 49.)
“In the winter
of 2020, multiple employees, including several surgery technicians, were out on
leave due to illness.”  (FAC ¶ 51.)  This required Plaintiff to cover additional
surgeries.  (FAC ¶ 54.)  Despite Kerlan-Jobe being overworked it
continued to book additional surgeries forcing Plaintiff to give up her lunch
and work without meal and rest breaks. 
(FAC ¶¶ 55-56.)  In December 2020,
Plaintiff confronted Kevin Bowdry about the intolerable work conditions,
expressed concerns as to whether she was properly compensated for all hours
worked, and complained that Dr. ElAttrache’s preference for high volume and
unnecessarily exposing patients to general anesthesia without true consent was
placing patients at risk.  (FAC ¶¶ 57-60.)  However, Kevin Bowdry dismissed Plaintiff’s
concerns.  (FAC ¶ 61.)
On May 17, 2021,
Plaintiff’s doctor placed her on medical leave so that she could undergo
treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.  (FAC
¶ 62.)  On August 17, 2021, Plaintiff exhausted
her 12-week CFRA/FMLA leave and required an extension of medical leave through
October 4, 2021 for a total of four months and two weeks of leave.  (FAC ¶¶ 63-64.)  Such leave had been regularly provided in the
past to Plaintiff, (FAC ¶ 40), and provided to younger employees who took even
longer leaves, (FAC ¶¶ 53, 67-68). 
However, when Plaintiff’s doctor notified Kerlan-Jobe on October 1, 2021
that Plaintiff would be able to return full time without restriction on October
5, 2021, Plaintiff was thereafter terminated despite work being available.  (FAC ¶¶ 69-70.)  This was because Defendants preferred
substantially younger employees.  (FAC ¶
71.)  In fact, Defendants replaced
Plaintiff the week she was due to return to work with a substantially younger
surgery technician with less experience than Plaintiff.  (FAC ¶ 73.) 
Further, Defendants continue to fill surgery technician openings with
substantially younger employees.  (FAC ¶
74.)
 
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.030 provides that, “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter
governing any particular discovery method . . . , the court, after notice to
any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may
impose . . . [monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating] sanctions against
anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process . . .
.”  Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.010 provides that “[m]issues of the discovery process include, but are not
limited to, the following: . . . (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery. . . . (g) Disobeying a court order to provide
discovery . . . .”
“Nevertheless, absent unusual
circumstances, such as repeated and egregious discovery abuses, two facts are
generally prerequisite to the imposition of a nonmonetary sanction. There must
be a failure to comply with a court order and the failure must be willful.”  (Lee v. Lee (2009) 175
Cal.App.4th 1553, 1559.)  “Even where
nonmonetary sanctions are called for, they ‘ “...’should be appropriate to the
dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.’ [Citations.] ‘ “...
[¶] The sanctions the court may impose are such as are suitable and necessary
to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he
seeks, but the court may not impose sanctions which are designed not to
accomplish the objects of discovery but to impose punishment.’ ” ’
[Citations.]”  (Biles v. Exxon Mobil
Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.)
“A trial court has broad
discretion when imposing a discovery sanction.” 
(Lee, supra, 175 Cal.App.4th at p.1559.)  “In exercising this discretion [for
nonmonetary sanctions], a variety of factors may be relevant, including, 1) the
time which has elapsed since [the discovery requests] were served, 2)
whether the party served was previously given a voluntary extension of time, 3)
the number of [the discovery requests] propounded, 4) whether the unanswered
questions sought information which was difficult to obtain, 5) whether the
answers supplied were evasive and incomplete, 6) the number of questions which
remained unanswered, 7) whether the questions which remain unanswered are
material to a particular claim or defense, 8) whether the answering party has acted
in good faith, and with reasonable diligence, 9) the existence of prior orders
compelling discovery and the answering party's response thereto, 10) whether
the party was unable to comply with the previous order of the court, 11)
whether an order allowing more time to answer would enable the answering party
to supply the necessary information, and, 12) whether a sanction short of
dismissal or default would be appropriate to the dereliction.”  (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 796–797.)
 
Discussion 
            Here, Plaintiff
seeks fifteen (15) issue and evidentiary sanctions on the ground that Defendant
CSMC failed to comply with the August 1, 2023 Order.  
 
Failure to Comply with the August 1, 2023 Order
            On August 1, 2023,
the Court issued two written orders.  The
first order ruled on as to Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant CSMC to
provide further responses to Request for Production, Set Two.  The second August 1, 2023 Order ruled on Plaintiff’s
amended motion to compel Defendants Kerlan-Jobe Surgery Center, LLC to serve
responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos.
1-145, 165-205, Plaintiff’s Specially Prepared Interrogatories, Set One, Nos.
1-104, 110-127, Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories Employment Law, Set One, and
Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission, Nos. 1-29, to compel Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center to serve responses to Request for Production of Documents Set One, Nos.
1-17, 31-56 and Specially Prepared Interrogatories, Set One Nos. 1-34, and to compel
Defendants to further respond to Form Interrogatories Employment Law, No. 216.1.  
Whether
Defendant CMSC complied with the first order requiring Defendant
CSMC to serve further responses to Request for Production, Set Two (the “August
1, 2023 Order”) is at issue for the instant motion.
            In
relevant part, Plaintiff moved to compel Defendant CSMC’s further response to
Request for Production, Set Two (“RPDs”) Nos. 60-65, 69, 70-75, 77, 78, 80, 81,
87, and 90-93.  On July 28, 2023 – just
after Defendant CMSC filed the reply but right before the hearing – Defendant
CSMC served supplemental responses to these at issue RPDs.  (Nesbit Decl. ¶ 11, Exh. F.)  On August 1, 2023, the Court ordered CSMC “to serve further, verified, code compliant
responses as to Request for Production, Set Two Nos. 60-65, 69, 70-75, 77, 78,
80, 81, 87, and 90-93 without objection – except as to attorney client
privilege with an accompanying privilege log – within twenty (20) days of
notice of this order and produce the respective responsive documents within
thirty (30) days of notice of this order.” 
(Order 8/1/23 at p.14:8-12.) 
            On August 4, 2023, Plaintiff gave notice of this order.  (Gevorkian Decl. ¶ 4, Exh. 3.)  CSMC did not serve
any further responses.  (Gevorkian Decl.
¶ 5.)  Rather, as noted in a September
12, 2023 joint-status report, Defendant CSMC claimed that it had complied with
the Court’s August 1, 2023 Order by virtue of the July 28, 2023 responses.  (Gevorkian Decl. ¶ 6, Exh. 5.)  Plaintiff asserts that the July 28, 2023
Supplemental responses are insufficient and that the Court should therefore impose
monetary and issue sanctions.
 
            The
July 28, 2023 Responses do Not Comply with the August 1, 2023 Order
            Here,
a portion of each of Defendant CMSC’s supplemental responses contains a nearly
identical objection:
 
Defendant objects to this request on the ground that it is vague and
ambiguous. Defendant also objects to this request as it is overbroad and
compound. Defendant further objects to this request to the extent that it seeks
documents that are neither relevant to the claims at issue nor reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Defendant further
objects to this request to the extent that it seeks sensitive and confidential
business, financial, or proprietary documents. Defendant further objects to
this request to the extent that it seeks information protected by the
attorney-client privilege, the attorney work product doctrine and/or other
privileges, protections, or doctrines of similar effect. Defendant further
objects to this request on the ground that it seeks documents protected by
third-parties’ privacy rights. Defendant objects to this request to the extent
it calls for a legal conclusion and expert opinion.  
(See e.g.,
Supplemental Response to RPD No. 60.)
            These
objections were all considered and overruled in the August 1, 2023 Order –
except as to Attorney Client Privilege. 
(Order 8/1/23 at pp.7:17-13:6.)  Moreover,
the August 1, 2023 Order required Defendant CSMC to provide further responses “without objection – except as to attorney client
privilege with an accompanying privilege log – within twenty (20) days of
notice of this order and produce the respective responsive documents within
thirty (30) days of notice of this order.” 
(Order 8/1/23 at p.14:10-12, [Bold, Italics, Underline Added].)  Any response with any objection – except as to attorney client
privilege – is plainly in violation of the August 1, 2023 Order. Moreover, Defendant
CSMC did not produce a privilege log as to the attorney client privilege claim
as ordered.  (Gevorkian Decl. ¶ 5; Nesbit Decl. ¶ 11, Exh. F.)
            In
addition to the improperly included objections, the substantive responses are
further non-compliant with the August 1, 2023 Order.  In the supplemental responses to RPDs No. 60-64,
69, 72-74, 77, 80 and 81, Defendant CSMC identically states that:
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Defendant
responds as follows: After a reasonable and diligent inquiry, Defendant is
unable to comply with this request because Plaintiff has refused to clarify
and/or narrow the scope of this request so as phrased, Defendant is unable to
locate or identify documents responsive to this request without having to guess
and/or expend substantial time and resources to do so. Defendant is willing to
further meet and confer with Plaintiff to understand and narrow the scope of
this request to determine if there are documents that are reasonably calculated
to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence related to the allegations in
Plaintiff’s lawsuit.
(See e.g., Supplemental
Response to RPD No. 60.)
            This
substantive response is improper in that it is subject to the improper and
overruled objections and merely asserts other objections based on burden and
vagueness.  To the
extent that it was not reasonably possible to respond to any ordered RPD, it
was incumbent on Defendant CSMC to request a limitation from the Court prior to
the issuance of the August 1, 2023 Order or through a reconsideration
motion.  Defendant CSMC could have also requested
relief through a writ.  It was not proper
for Defendant CSMC to merely assert objections in violation of the August 1,
2023 Order.  
            As to the
remaining RPDs Nos. 65, 70, 71, 75, 78, 87, and 90-93, Defendant CSMC provides
the identical substantive response in the supplemental responses:
Subject
to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Defendant responds as follows:
After a reasonable and diligent inquiry, Defendant does not have any documents
in its possession, custody or control responsive to this request because they
have never existed.
(See e.g., Supplemental
Response to RPD No. 93.)
            Each of these
supplemental responses is subject to the improper and overruled objections in
violation of the August 1, 2023 Order.  
Further, as to any claim of
attorney client privilege, Defendant CMSC’s response
is not code compliant as ordered. To provide a code-compliant response as
ordered, Defendant CSMC was required
to provide a privilege log identifying any withheld document and enough
information to support the claim of attorney client privilege.  (See CCP § 2031.240(b)(1-2),
[“b) If the responding party objects to the demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling of an item or category of item, the response shall do both
of the following: (1) Identify with particularity any document, tangible
thing, land, or electronically stored information falling within any category
of item in the demand to which an objection is being made. (2) Set forth
clearly the extent of, and the specific ground for, the objection. If an
objection is based on a claim of privilege, the particular privilege invoked
shall be stated. If an objection is based on a claim that the information
sought is protected work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010), that claim shall be expressly asserted.”] [Italics added.].)  Defendant CSMC has not done so.  Thus, Defendant CSMC has violated the Court’s
August 1, 2023 Order. 
 
            Sanctions are
Warranted
            “[T]wo facts are
generally prerequisite to the imposition of a nonmonetary sanction. There must
be a failure to comply with a court order and the failure must be
willful.”  (Lee v. Lee (2009)
175 Cal.App.4th 1553, 1559.)  Moreover,
“[e]ven where nonmonetary sanctions are called for, they ‘ “...’should be
appropriate to the dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.’
[Citations.] ‘ “... [¶] The sanctions the court may impose are such as are
suitable and necessary to enable the party seeking discovery to obtain the
objects of the discovery he seeks, but the court may not impose sanctions which
are designed not to accomplish the objects of discovery but to impose
punishment.’ ” ’ [Citations.]”  (Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.)
            As noted above,
CSMC has violated the August 1, 2023 Order. 
Defendant CSMC’s reassertion of overruled objections indicate that
CSMC’s violations are willful, thus potentially warranting nonmonetary
sanctions as requested by the issue sanctions. 

            However, the
Court is inclined to provide CSMC one final opportunity to comply with the
August 1, 2023 Order.  Therefore,
Plaintiff’s request for issue sanctions 1-15 against Defendant CSMC is
CONTINUED.
 
Monetary Sanctions
            Here, as Defendant
CSMC has failed to comply with the August 1, 2023 Order in part, monetary
sanctions are warranted.
            “If a party then
fails to obey an order compelling further response [to interrogatories, request
for production, or requests for admission], the court may … impose a monetary
sanction under [CCP § 2023.030.]”  (CCP §§
2030.300(e), 2031.310(i), 2033.290(e).) 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030(a), the court may impose
sanction covering the costs of “reasonable expenses, including attorney’s
fees”.  (CCP § 2023.030(a).)  
            Here, Plaintiff’s
Counsel states that she spent ten hours preparing the instant motion and
anticipates spending another five hours in connection with this motion at an
hourly rate of $590 and incurred filing fees. 
(Gevorkian Decl. ¶¶ 22-23.)  The
requested amount is high and somewhat excessive.  Based on the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that $4,500.00
reasonably compensates Plaintiffs for attorney’s fees and costs incurred in
bringing this motion.
            Defendant Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center is ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,500.00 to
Plaintiff Kristina Holman by and through counsel, within thirty (30) days of
notice of this order.  
 
Conclusion and ORDER
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs
Kristina Holman’s motion for issue and evidentiary sanctions is GRANTED IN
PART.
            Defendant Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center is ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,500.00 to
Plaintiff Kristina Holman by and through counsel, within thirty (30) days of
notice of this order.  
            Plaintiff’s
request for Issue Sanctions 1-15 is CONTINUED to _____________, 2024.
            Defendant Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center is to ordered to serve further, verified, code compliant responses
as to Request for Production, Set Two Nos. 60-65, 69, 70-75, 77, 78, 80, 81,
87, and 90-93 without objection – except as to attorney client privilege –
within twenty (20) days of notice of this order and produce the respective
responsive documents within thirty (30) days of notice of this order.  Any claim of attorney-client privilege must
be supported by a privilege log specifically identifying any withheld documents
and sufficient information to support the claim of attorney-client
privilege.  Defendant’s failure to do so
will result in the imposition of the requested issue sanctions against
Defendant.
            Plaintiff and
Defendant Kerlan-Jobe Surgery Center are to file a joint statement no later
than March 8, 2024 identifying whether Defendant Kerlan-Jobe Surgery Center has
complied with the instant order and attaching Defendant’s further responses.  
Moving
Parties are to give notice and file proof of service of such.
