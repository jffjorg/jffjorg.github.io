I.          INTRODUCTION

 
On August 17, 2023, plaintiff Tori Chen (Chen) initiated
this FEHA action against her employer, defendant Los Angeles Department of
Water and Power (LADWP), for (1) Gender Discrimination in Violation of FEHA,
(2) Race Discrimination in Violation of FEHA, (3) Harassment on the Basis of
Race and Gender in Violation of FEHA, (4) Retaliation in Violation of FEHA, and
(5) Failure to Prevent Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation in Violation
of FEHA.  
 
On July 18, 2024, Chen filed this Motion to File First
Amended Complaint.  
 
The motion is unopposed.[1]
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
            The court
may, in its discretion and after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any
terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading, including adding or
striking out the name of any party, or correcting a mistake in the name of a
party, or a mistake in any other respect.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).)¿
“Public policy dictates that leave to amend be liberally granted.”¿ (Centex
Homes v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 23,
32.)¿ “Although courts are bound to apply a policy of great liberality in
permitting amendments to the complaint at any stage of the proceedings, up to
and including trial . . . this policy should be applied only ‘where no
prejudice is shown to the adverse party.’¿ [Citation].¿ A different result is
indicated ‘where inexcusable delay and probable prejudice to the opposing
party’ is shown.¿ [Citation.]” ¿(Magpali v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996)
48 Cal.App.4th 471, 487.)¿ 
 
            A motion to
amend a pleading must include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended
pleading which must be serially numbered to differentiate it from previous
pleadings or amendments and must state what allegations in the previous
pleading are proposed to be deleted or added, if any, and where, by page,
paragraph, and line number, the allegations are located. (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1324(a).)¿ The motion shall also be accompanied by a declaration
attesting to the effect of the amendment, why the amendment is necessary and
proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered,
and why the request for amendment was not made earlier.¿ (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 1.324(b).)¿ 
 
            In ruling
on a motion for leave to amend the complaint, the court does not consider the
merits of the proposed amendment, because “the preferable practice would be to
permit the amendment and allow the parties to test its legal sufficiency by
demurrer, motion for judgment on the pleadings or other appropriate
proceedings.”¿ (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213
Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048.)¿ While the court may deny leave to amend where the
proposed amendment is insufficient to state a valid cause of action or defense,
such denial is most appropriate where the insufficiency cannot be cured by
further amendment—i.e., where the statute of limitations has expired or the
insufficiency is established by controlling caselaw. (California casualty
Gen. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 280-281,
disapproved on other grounds in Kransco v. American Empire Surplus Lines
Ins. Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 390.)¿ 
 
III.       APPLICATION
 
Chen seeks leave to file the proposed first amended complaint
to add one cause of action for wrongful termination.  Chen explains the amendment is made at this
time because her termination from employment with LADWP on November 27, 2023,
occurred after the filing of the Complaint and LADWP’s Answer.  
  
The motion complies with the requirements of California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1342(a).  Further,
as the motion is unopposed, the court finds no prejudice will result if leave is
granted to file the amended complaint.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
            The unopposed
motion for leave to file the First Amended Complaint is GRANTED.  The First Amended Complaint is deemed filed
and served on this date.  Plaintiff is directed
to separately file the First Amended Complaint within five court days of this
order.
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
