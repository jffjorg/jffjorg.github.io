And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Kerry Bensinger, issued a tentative ruling on November 19, 2024, in the case of Sunny Zia v. Tom Baldwin, et al. (Case No. 21STCV24654). The defendants, City of Long Beach, Harbor Department, Mark Erickson, Tom Baldwin, and Stacey Lewis, moved to compel the plaintiff, Sunny Zia, to appear for a third deposition and to produce documents at the deposition. The motion was unopposed.

The judge granted the motion, ordering Plaintiff Sunny Zia to appear for deposition within 30 days of the order and to produce documents responsive to the deposition notice. The judge also denied the request for sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel.

The judge's ruling was based on the fact that Plaintiff Zia has not appeared for deposition, despite attempts by the defendants to schedule a third deposition. The judge noted that the defendants did not seek leave to compel Plaintiff Zia to appear for a third deposition, and therefore the court only now issues the order compelling her to appear and produce documents. The judge also found that imposition of sanctions would be unjust in this case.
