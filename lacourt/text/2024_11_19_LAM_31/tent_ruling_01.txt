MOTION
TO COMPEL DEPOSITION OF PLAINTIFF, THE PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS AT DEPOSITION 



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendants
City of Long Beach, et al.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition 
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On July 2, 2021, plaintiff Sunny Zia (Zia or Plaintiff) filed
this FEHA action against defendants, City of Long Beach and its Harbor
Department, Mark Erickson, Tom Baldwin, and Stacey Lewis (collectively,
Defendants).  The First Amended Complaint
(FAC), filed on June 20, 2022, is the operative pleading.  
 
            On July 26,
2024, Defendants filed this motion to compel Zia to appear at a third deposition
and to produce documents at the deposition. 
Defendants seek sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel.
 
            The motion
is unopposed.
                         
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS
 
Any party may obtain discovery by
taking in California the oral deposition of any person.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.010.)  “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action…without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to
appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd.
(a).)   
 
            Monetary
Sanctions¿ 
¿ 
            Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court
to impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which
includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial
justification making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿ 
¿ 
            If
sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that
the notice specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought
and the type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points
and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the
amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿¿¿ 
 
            “If
a motion under [Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450] subdivision (a) is
granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and
against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless
the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)¿¿¿¿ 
 
Sanctions against counsel:¿ The court in Kwan
Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81 (Hennings)
noted that discovery sanctions against an attorney are governed by a different
standard than sanctions against a party:¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
By the terms of the statute, a trial court under section
2023.030(a) may not impose monetary sanctions against a party’s attorney unless
the court finds that the attorney “advised” the party to engage in the conduct
resulting in sanctions. (§ 2023.030(a); Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 256, 261, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ “Unlike monetary sanctions
against a party, which are based on the party's misuse of the discovery
process, monetary sanctions against the party's attorney require a finding the
‘attorney advis[ed] that conduct.’ ” (Ibid.) “It is not enough that the
attorney's actions were in some way improper.” (Corns v. Miller (1986)
181 Cal.App.3d 195, 200, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247 (Corns).) Because an
attorney's advice to a client is “peculiarly within [his or her] knowledge,”
the attorney has the burden of showing that he or she did not counsel discovery
abuse. (Ibid.) Accordingly, when a party seeking sanctions against an
attorney offers sufficient evidence of a misuse of the discovery process, the
burden shifts to the attorney to demonstrate that he or she did not recommend
that conduct. (Id. at pp. 200–201, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247; Ghanooni,
at p. 262, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Defendants
seek an order compelling Plaintiff to appear for a third deposition and to
produce documents at the deposition.  Despite appearing for deposition on two prior
occasions, Defendants explain that Plaintiff’s deposition could not be
completed.  Thereafter, they made several
attempts to schedule a third deposition. 
Despite their efforts, Plaintiff has not appeared.   (See
Jenkins Decl.)
 
            Given
that Plaintiff has not opposed the motion, the court finds good cause to compel
Plaintiff to appear for another deposition and to produce the requested
documents.  Defendants have not completed
their examination of Plaintiff.  
 
            Monetary
Sanctions
 
            Defendants
request sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel.  In the context of a motion to compel a party’s
deposition, sanctions are mandatory, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)¿¿Here, the court finds
imposition of sanctions would be unjust. 
Defendants admit having deposed Plaintiff on two prior occasions.  Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.610,
subdivision (a) provides, “once any party has taken the deposition of any
natural person, including that of a party to the action, neither the party who
gave, nor any other party who has been served with a deposition notice pursuant
to Section 2025.240 may take a subsequent deposition of that deponent.”  However, “[n]otwithstanding subdivision (a),
for good cause shown, the court may grant leave to take a subsequent
deposition, and the parties, with the consent of any deponent who is not a
party, may stipulate that a subsequent deposition be taken.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.610, subd. (b).). 
            
            Here,
Defendants did not seek leave to compel Plaintiff to appear for a third
deposition.  The court only now issues
the order compelling Plaintiff to appear and to produce documents. 
 
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
            The
unopposed motion is GRANTED.  Plaintiff Sunny
Zia is ordered to appear for deposition within 30 days of this order and to
produce documents responsive to the deposition notice.
 
            The request
for sanctions is DENIED. 
 
Moving party to give notice, unless waived.
