And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendants (Ford Motor Company, Cerritos Ford Inc. dba Norm Reeves Ford Superstore) to the fifth and sixth causes of action in a Song-Beverly action brought by the plaintiff (Elgie Luse). The plaintiff alleges that the defendants failed to repair defects in a 2020 Ford F150 and concealed the defects at the time of purchase. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's claims for negligent repair and fraudulent concealment fail because the plaintiff has not alleged specific facts showing the extent of the damages and because there is no duty to disclose the information. The Judge sustains the demurrer to the fifth cause of action (negligent repair) because the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts showing the extent of the damages. The Judge also sustains the demurrer to the sixth cause of action (fraudulent concealment) because there is no duty to disclose the information. The Judge grants leave to amend the complaint as to the fifth cause of action only.
