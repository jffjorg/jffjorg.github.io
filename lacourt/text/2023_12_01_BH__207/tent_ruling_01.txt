background
 
On March 18, 2019, Plaintiffs Milan
Cvejic (“Plaintiff”) and Kareem Akhtar filed the instant action against
Defendants Skyview Capital, LLC, Newnet Communications Technologies, LLC,
Newnet Investment Group, Alex Soltani, and Christopher Aye (“Defendants”). The
Complaint asserts causes of action for (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of
the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (3) willful failure to pay
wages; (4) quantum meruit; (5) promissory estoppel; (6) conversion; (7)
intentional misrepresentation; (8) violation of Labor Code section 970; (9)
wrongful termination in violation of public policy; (10) unlawful business
practices; (11) failure to reimburse; (12) breach of fiduciary duty; (13)
unjust enrichment; and (14) declaratory relief. 
 
On December 5, 2019, the Court
granted Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration and stayed the proceedings
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.4.  Arbitration fees were due by June 4, 2021.  On July 9, 2021, Defendants had still not
paid the arbitration fee.
 
Plaintiff moved to withdraw the
matter from arbitration pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.98,
which the Court granted on February 14, 2022. 
(See Feb. 14, 2022 Minute Order.) 
Defendants appealed this order, and the Court of Appeal affirmed this
Court’s ruling on June 28, 2023.  
 
Plaintiff now moves for an order imposing
monetary sanctions against Defendants in the amount of $455,830.96 for
attorneys’ fees and costs, including a 1.5 lodestar multiplier, pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure sections 1281.98 and 1281.99.  Defendants have opposed and Plaintiff has
replied.
 
DISCUSSION
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 1281.98 provides, in relevant portion:
 
(a)(1) In
an employment or consumer arbitration that requires, either expressly or
through application of state or federal law or the rules of the arbitration
provider, that the drafting party pay certain fees and costs during the
pendency of an arbitration proceeding, if the fees or costs required to
continue the arbitration proceeding are not paid within 30 days after the due
date, the drafting party is in material breach of the arbitration agreement, is
in default of the arbitration, and waives its right to compel the employee or
consumer to proceed with that arbitration as a result of the material breach.
 
[…]
 
(b) If the drafting party materially breaches the
arbitration agreement and is in default under subdivision (a), the employee or
consumer may unilaterally elect to do any of the following:  (1) Withdraw the claim from
arbitration and proceed in a court of appropriate jurisdiction. 
 
[…]
 
(c) If the employee or consumer
withdraws the claim from arbitration and proceeds in a court of appropriate
jurisdiction pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b), both of the
following apply:  (1) The
employee or consumer may bring a motion, or a separate action, to recover all
attorney's fees and all costs associated with the abandoned arbitration
proceeding. The recovery of arbitration fees, interest, and related attorney's
fees shall be without regard to any findings on the merits in the underlying action
or arbitration.  (2) The
court shall impose sanctions on the drafting party in accordance with
Section 1281.99.

 
Section 1281.99
provides:
 
(a)  
The
court shall impose a monetary sanction against a drafting party that materially
breaches an arbitration agreement pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section
1281.97 or subdivision (a) of Section 1281.98, by ordering the drafting
party to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees and costs,
incurred by the employee or consumer as a result of the material breach.
 
(b)  
In
addition to the monetary sanction described in subdivision (a), the court may
order any of the following sanctions against a drafting party that materially
breaches an arbitration agreement pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section
1281.97 or subdivision (a) of Section 1281.98, unless the court finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(1)  
An
evidence sanction by an order prohibiting the drafting party from conducting
discovery in the civil action.
 
(2)  
A
terminating sanction by one of the following orders:
 
(A) An order striking out the pleadings or
parts of the pleadings of the drafting party.
(B) An order rendering a judgment by
default against the drafting party.
 
(3) A contempt sanction by an order
treating the drafting party as in contempt of court.
 
Plaintiff
requests $114,505 in attorneys’ fees and $846.48 in costs related to the arbitration
proceedings; $154,830 in attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with the
appeal; and $33,870 in attorneys’ fees and $176.98 in costs incurred in
connection with bringing the instant motion, for a total of $303,205.00 in
attorneys’ fees incurred, multiplied by 1.5, for a grand total of $454,807.50
in attorneys’ fees and $1,023.46 in costs. 
Plaintiff argues the requested fees and costs are compulsory under the
statute scheme.
 
Defendant counters
that the requested attorneys’ fees and costs are not mandatory under the
relevant statutes, and urges the court to exercise its discretion to deny the
requested fees and costs, on the basis that they were not reasonably incurred.  Specifically, Defendant takes issue with the
fact that Plaintiff chose to withdraw from arbitration on the eve of trial.  Defendant also argues that the motion for
attorneys’ fees is premature, as no final judgment has yet issued, and that
they are barred by virtue of the appellate court’s award of costs only.
 
1.      Mandatory
Or Discretionary
 
A careful review
of the statutes at issue demonstrates that the requested fees are compulsory based
upon the record before the Court.  Section
1281.98, subdivision (c) provides: 
 
If the employee
or consumer withdraws the claim from arbitration and proceeds in a court of
appropriate jurisdiction pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b), both
of the following apply:   
 
(1) The employee
or consumer may bring a motion, or a separate action, to recover all
attorney's fees and all costs associated with the abandoned arbitration
proceeding. The recovery of arbitration fees, interest, and related
attorney's fees shall be without regard to any findings on the merits in the
underlying action or arbitration.  
 
(2) The court shall
impose sanctions on the drafting party in accordance with Section 1281.99.
 
(Emphasis added.)
 
            Similarly,
Section 1281.99, subdivision (a) provides:
 
(a)  
The
court shall impose a monetary sanction against a drafting party
that materially breaches an arbitration agreement pursuant to subdivision
(a) of Section 1281.97 or subdivision (a) of Section 1281.98, by
ordering the drafting party to pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney's fees and costs, incurred by the employee or consumer as a result of
the material breach.
(Emphasis added.)
 
            Thus,
pursuant to Section 1281.98, subdivision (c)(1), Plaintiff is entitled to “all
attorneys’ fees and costs associated with the abandoned arbitration
proceeding.”  As such, Plaintiff is
entitled to the full $114,505 in attorneys’ fees and
$846.48 costs requested that were incurred in connection with the abandoned
arbitration proceeding.
 
Further, pursuant to Section
1281.98, subdivision (c)(2) and 1281.99, subdivision (a), Plaintiff is entitled
to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred as a result of the material
breach.  Here, as a result of Defendants’
material breach by failing to timely pay the arbitration fee, and subsequent
appeal of Plaintiff’s decision to abandon the arbitration, as authorized by the
plain text of the statute, Plaintiff incurred additional attorneys’ fees and
costs on appeal and in bringing the instant motion.  In short, but for the Defendants’ material
breach, Plaintiff would not have incurred attorneys’ fees and costs at the
arbitration, trial court and appellate court levels.  As such, the Court understands that the
public policy as set forth in Sections 1281.98 and 1281.99 when read in context
and harmonized provide for the legal basis to award the attorneys’ fees and
costs as requested by Plaintiff at this stage of the litigation.    
 
Equally
important, consistent with this analysis, in the Court’s February 14, 2022
Minute Order, the Court granted, as mandatory, “Plaintiff’s request for
reasonable expenses under C.C.P. section 1281.99.”  (February 14, 2022 Minute Order at p. 6.)
 
2.      Reasonableness
of Fees Sought
 
Unlike Section 1281.98, subdivision (c)(1), which
mandates awarding all fees and costs Plaintiff
incurred in connection with the abandoned arbitration proceedings, sanctions
awarded pursuant to section 1281.99, subdivision (a) for additional attorneys’
fees and costs incurred as a result of Defendants’ material breach are subject
to a reasonableness qualifier.
 
Defendants
contend that the requested fees are unreasonable for two reasons: (1) it was
unreasonable for Plaintiff to withdraw from arbitration two weeks before the
scheduled trial; and (2) Plaintiff’s appeal-related expenses are unreasonable
because they exceed the amount Plaintiff expended in connection with the
underlying arbitration proceedings.  The
Court disagrees.
 
With respect to
Defendants’ first argument, it is not unreasonable for Plaintiff to exercise
the statutory right to abandon arbitration proceedings upon Defendants’ material
breach by failure to timely pay the arbitration fees.  The purpose of Sections 1281.98 and 1281.99
is to further the public policy of ensuring “the efficient resolution of cases”
by preventing a Defendant from compelling arbitration, only to let the case
languish in “procedural purgatory” by subsequently refusing to timely pay the
arbitration fees.  (Cvejic v. Skyview
Capital, LLC. (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 1073, 1076, 1079.)  In furtherance of these goals, the
legislature clearly intended the consequences of a defendant’s failure to
timely pay the arbitration fees to be severe. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.98, subd. (c)(1) [“The recovery of arbitration
fees, interest, and related attorney's fees shall be without regard to any
findings on the merits in the underlying action or arbitration”].)  Therefore, while Defendants may find the
result harsh, it is reasonable; it is precisely what the legislature intended.
 
As for the
amount of fees incurred on appeal, the Court does not find that the requested
fees are unreasonable merely because they exceed the fees incurred in
connection with the underlying arbitration proceedings.  Plaintiff was forced to defend its choice to
withdraw from the arbitration proceedings by virtue of Defendants’ appeal of
the Court’s order permitting Plaintiff to withdraw.  The issues on appeal were novel and complex,
and required Plaintiff to vigorously defend itself from Defendants’ challenge.  As such, Plaintiff’s requested fees in
connection with the appeal were reasonably and necessarily incurred as a result
of Defendants’ material breach and subsequent appeal of the order granting
Plaintiff’s request to withdraw from arbitration.  Similarly, Plaintiff’s costs and fees
incurred in connection with this motion were also reasonably and necessarily incurred
as a result of Defendants’ material breach.
 
Therefore,
Plaintiff is also entitled to the requested $154,830 in attorneys’ fees
incurred in connection with the appeal and $33,870 in attorneys’ fees and
$176.98 in costs incurred in connection with bringing the instant motion.
 
3.      1.5
Multiplier
 
The purpose of a
lodestar adjustment is to “augment” the “unadorned lodestar in order to
approximate the fair market rate for such services.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1132 (hereafter Ketchum).)  “In
cases involving the enforcement of constitutional or statutory rights [but
little or no damages], such fee enhancements may make such cases economically
feasible to competent private attorneys.” 
(Taylor v. Nabors Drilling USA, LP (2014) 222 Cal.App.4th 1228,
1252; Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 1133.) 
 
In determining
whether a multiplier is appropriate, courts consider the following factors: “(1)
the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed
in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation
precluded other employment by the attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of
the fee award.”  (Id. at p. 1132.)
 
Here, the Court
does not find a multiplier necessary or appropriate.  Although Plaintiff incurred the fees
defending its right to abandon the arbitration proceedings as a result of
Defendants’ late arbitration fee payment, the 207.70 hours expended in
connection with the appeal, which exceed the 163.40 hours expended in
connection with the underlying arbitration proceedings, plus the hourly rates
sought ($600 and $750 per hour) already adequately and reasonably compensate
Plaintiff.  
 
4.      Timeliness
of Fee Motion
 
Defendants
contend the fee motion is premature because there is not yet a final
judgment.  In support, Defendants cite to
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1702(b), which requires that an attorneys’
fee motion be brought within the time for filing a notice of appeal under Rules
8.104 and 8.108.  Rule 8.104 requires
that a notice of appeal be filed “on or before” the earliest of 60 days after
the clerk serves the “Notice of Entry” of judgment, 60 days after the appealing
party serves or is served with the “Notice of Entry” of judgment, or 180 days
after entry of judgment.  Plaintiff has
brought the instant fee motion “before” the earliest of those three dates.  Rule 8.108 pertains to various extensions of
those deadlines.  
 
Moreover, none
of these Rules stand for the proposition that a sanction or attorney fee award
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1281.98 or 1281.99 may not be
brought until after a final judgment. 
Therefore, the motion is timely.
 
5.      Fees
Barred by Court of Appeal
 
Defendants
finally contend that the requested attorneys’ fees and costs were barred by the
Court of Appeal, which did not order attorneys’ fees or costs incurred in its
ruling.  In support, Defendants cite to
California Rules of Court, rule 8.278(d)(2) which provides, “unless the court
orders otherwise, an award of costs neither includes attorney’s fees on appeal
nor precludes a party from seeking them under rule 3.1702.”  Thus, pursuant to the plain language of the
statute, the fact that the Court of Appeal only awarded Plaintiff’s costs does
not preclude Plaintiff from subsequently seeking attorneys’ fees incurred in
connection with the appeal.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court
grants in part Plaintiff’s request for attorneys’ fees and sanctions and awards
Plaintiff a total of $303,205 in attorneys’ fees and $1,023.46 in costs,
representing $114,505 in attorneys’ fees and $846.48 in costs associated with the
arbitration proceedings, $154,830 in attorneys’ fees incurred in connection
with the appeal, and $33,870 in attorneys’ fees and $176.98 in costs incurred
in connection with bringing the instant motion. 
Plaintiff’s request for a 1.5 lodestar multiplier is denied.  
 
Plaintiff
shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof of service
regarding the same.
