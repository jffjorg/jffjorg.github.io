And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling states that the Plaintiff, Milan Cvejic, is entitled to a total of $303,205 in attorneys' fees and $1,023.46 in costs, which includes $114,505 in attorneys' fees and $846.48 in costs associated with the arbitration proceedings, $154,830 in attorneys' fees incurred in connection with the appeal, and $33,870 in attorneys' fees and $176.98 in costs incurred in connection with bringing the instant motion. The Judge finds that the requested fees are compulsory under the statutes and that the Plaintiff's decision to withdraw from arbitration proceedings was reasonable. The Judge also denies the Plaintiff's request for a 1.5 lodestar multiplier. The ruling is based on the Code of Civil Procedure sections 1281.98 and 1281.99, which provide for the award of attorneys' fees and costs in cases where a defendant fails to timely pay an arbitration fee.
