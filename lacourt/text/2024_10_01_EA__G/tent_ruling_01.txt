  Case Number:  22PSCV00446    Hearing Date:   October 1, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiffs M Capital  Global California and Sokly Chen’s Demurrer to Cross-Complaint Respondent: Defendants Yanlin  Li, Fiorano Motorsport LLC, Bianco Corsa Motorsport, Inc., and Yokohama Imports  USA, LLC Plaintiff M Capital Global  California’s Motion to Strike Cross-Complaint Respondent: Defendants Yanlin  Li, Fiorano Motorsport LLC, Bianco Corsa Motorsport, Inc., and Yokohama Imports  USA, LLC TENTATIVE RULING Plaintiffs M Capital  Global California and Sokly Chen’s Demurrer to Cross-Complaint is SUSTAINED IN  PART without leave to amend as to the eleventh cause of action and with twenty  (20) days leave to amend as to all causes of action brought by Defendants Bianco  Corsa Motorsport, Inc., Yokohama Imports USA, LLC, and Yanlin Li, as well as  the second, third, fourth, fifth,  fourteenth, and fifteenth causes of action. The Demurrer is OVERRULED  IN PART as to the first, sixth,  seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, twelfth, and thirteenth causes of action. Plaintiff M Capital Global  California’s Motion to Strike Cross-Complaint is deemed MOOT. BACKGROUND This  is an action for breach of contract and fraud. In August 2021, Plaintiff Sokly  Chen, a member of Plaintiff M Capital Global California (M Capital), met with  Defendant Yanlin Li who invited Chen to invest in Li’s vehicle dealership  business by purchasing a fifty percent ownership interest in Fiorano Motorsport  LLC (Fiorano Motorsport) for $1,000,000. On September 22, 2021, Li prepared an  operating agreement that established Li and M Capital’s membership in Fiorano  Motorsport. That same month, M Capital provided an additional $1,500,000 at  Li’s request so Fiorano Motorsport could allegedly open a dealership. In total,  M Capital invested a total of $6,683,000 in Fiorano Motorsport. However, M  Capital and Chen allege Li subsequently embezzled most of these funds through  personal use or transferring the funds to other entities. In  February 2022, Fiorano Motorsport’s account had been drained of funds as Li had  been allegedly transferring the money to Li’s personal accounts and pocketing  revenue from purchases. When Li requested a $2,350,000 investment from M  Capital to cover expenses, M Capital questioned why the sale revenue was  insufficient. In response, Li claimed there was insufficient revenue and that  Li had used personal money to purchase vehicles. Li then claimed the $2,350,000  was debt owed by M Capital and began attempting to collect this debt by  allegedly threatening M Capital employees, attempting to break into M Capital’s  office, falsely reporting Chen to law enforcement for vehicle theft, and  stalking Chen. On  May 10, 2022, M Capital filed a complaint against Li, Fiorano Motorsport,  Bianco Corsa Motorsport, and Does 1-50, alleging the following causes of  action: (1) fraud, (2) breach of fiduciary duty, (3) breach of oral contract,  (4) common counts, (5) conversion, and (6) accounting. On  September 12, 2022, M Capital and Chen filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC)  against Li, Fiorano Motorsport, Bianco Corsa Motorsport (Bianco Corsa), and  Yokohama Imports USA, LLC (Yokohama, collectively Defendants) as well as Does  1-50, alleging the following causes of action: (1) fraud, (2) breach of  fiduciary duty, (3) breach of contract, (4) breach of quasi contract, (5)  involuntary dissolution under Corporations Code section 17707.03, (6) common  counts, (7) conversion, (8) accounting, (9) offer and sale of unqualified,  non-exempt securities in violation of Corporations Code section 25110, (10)  misrepresentation and/ or omissions of material facts in violation of  Corporations Code section 25401, (11) unlawful sale of securities under the  Securities Act of 1933, section 5, (12) unlawful fraudulent scheme under the  Securities Act of 1933, section 17, (13) unlawful business practices under  Business & Professions Code section 17200, and (14) intentional infliction  of emotional distress. On April 11, 2023, the court sustained Defendants’  demurrer to the FAC in part and overruled it in part. On  May 11, 2023, M Capital and Chen filed a Second Amended Complaint (SAC) against  the same Defendants alleging the following causes of action: (1) fraudulent  inducement, (2) fraud, (3) breach of fiduciary duty, (4) breach of contract,  (5) breach of quasi contract, (6) involuntary dissolution pursuant to  Corporations Code section 17707.03, (7) common counts, (8) conversion, (9)  accounting, (10) sale of securities by unlicensed broker-dealer in violation of  Corporations Code section 25501.5 et seq., (11) offer and sale of unqualified,  non-exempt securities in violation of Corporations Code sections 25503, 25504,  25504.1, and 25110 et seq., (12) offer misrepresentations and/or omissions of  material facts in violation of Corporations Code sections 25401, 25403, and  25404 et seq., (13) unlawful sale of securities pursuant to Securities Act,  section five, (14) unlawful fraudulent scheme pursuant to the Securities Act,  section 17, (15) unlawful business practices pursuant to Business and  Professions Code section 17200, and (16) intentional infliction of emotional  distress (IIED). On October 18, 2023, the court sustained Defendants’ demurrer  to the SAC in part and overruled it in part. On  November 6, 2023, M Capital and Chen filed a Third Amended Complaint (TAC)  against the same defendants alleging the same causes of action. On February 5,  2024, the court overruled Defendants’ demurrer to the TAC. On  February 21, 2024, Defendants filed a cross-complaint against Chen, M Capital,  and Roes 1-100, alleging the following causes of action: (1) breach of  contract, (2) breach of contract, (3) breach of fiduciary duty, (4) fraud and  deceit, (5) fraudulent inducement, (6) conversion, (7) unjust enrichment, (8)  theft, (9) constructive trust, (10) declaratory relief, (11) injunctive relief,  (12) intentional interference with prospective economic relations, (13)  negligent interference with prospective economic relations, (14) intentional  infliction of emotional distress (IIED), and (15) negligent infliction of  emotional distress (NIED). On  April 23, 2024, M Capital and Chen filed the present demurrer and motion to  strike. On July 25, 2024, the court continued the hearing on demurrer and motion  to strike in order for parties to meet and confer. On August 27, 2024, the  court again continued the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike after M  Capital and Chen’s counsel failed to timely file a supplemental declaration  describing meet and confer attempts. On August 28, 2024, M Capital and Chen’s  counsel filed a supplemental declaration that stated parties met and conferred  on July 30, 2024. (Ma Suppl. Decl., ¶ 4.) A hearing  on the present demurrer and motion to strike is set for October 1, 2024, along  with a case management conference/status conference re: ADR. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE M  Capital and Chen request the court take judicial notice of (1) Fiorano Motorsport’s  articles of incorporation as filed with the California Secretary of State, (2) a  Retail Certificate of Sale Receipt, (3) Li’s supplemental declaration that was  filed in support of Li’s motion to quash in the present action, and (4) a  letter from the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles (New York DMV). The  court GRANTS their request as to the articles of incorporation, Li’s supplemental  declaration, and the letter from the New York DMV pursuant to Evidence Code  section 452, subdivisions (c) and (d). The court DENIES their request as to the  retail certificate of sale as it is unclear if this record was generated by a  state government or by a private party. Defendants  request the court take judicial notice of a manufacturer’s certificate of  origin and a Retail Certificate of Sale Receipt. The court DENIES their request as these  documents do not constitute “[f]acts and propositions that are not reasonably  subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate determination by  resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code, § 452,  subd. (h).) ANALYSIS M  Capital and Chen demur to Defendants’ entire Cross-Complaint. For the following  reasons, the Court SUSTAINS IN PART and OVERRULES IN PART their demurrer. Legal Standard A  party may demur to a complaint on the grounds that it “does not state facts  sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.  (e).) A demurrer tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn  v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747 (Hahn).) When considering  demurrers, courts accept all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT  Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) In a demurrer proceeding,  the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial  notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,  994.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other  extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face  of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court  (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing  is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,  states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, at p. 747.) Standing M  Capital and Chen first argue Bianco Corsa and Yokohama lack standing as there  are no facts alleged as to them. (Demurrer, p. 8:28-9:8.) The court agrees and  notes it is not even clear which cause of action is being brought by these parties. M  Capital and Chen next argue Li lacks standing as an individual shareholder cannot  bring a cause of action on Fiorano Motorsport’s behalf. (Demurrer, p. 9:10-24.)  It well established that “the individual shareholder may not bring an action  for indirect personal losses (i.e., decrease in stock value) sustained as a  result of the overall harm to the entity.” (Bader v. Anderson (2009) 179  Cal.App.4th 775, 788.) Here, the present action is based on M Capital and  Chen’s alleged breach of agreements with Fiorano Motorsport and conversion or  theft of Fiorano Motorsport’s assets. While causes of action of action for  fraud and infliction of emotional distress are also alleged, these causes of  action are insufficiently pled for the reasons noted below. Li has not  demonstrated how Li has standing to bring an action for damages to Fiorano  Motorsport and has failed to address this issue in Li’s opposition. Last,  M Capital and Chen argue the Cross-Complaint fails to allege any facts to  establish a cause of action against Chen. (Demurrer, p. 9:27-10:1.) As to the  causes of action arising from the breach of contracts and fiduciary duties, the  court agrees since Chen is not alleged to have been a party to these agreements  as the agreements were between Li on Fiorano Motorsport’s behalf and M Capital.  (Cross-Complaint, ¶ 42, 52, 59, Ex. A-B.) To the extent the Cross-Complaint suggests  M Capital is Chen’s alter ego (Cross-Complaint, ¶ 10), the court finds this  cursory allegation fails to meet the requirements of Turman v. Superior  Court of Orange County (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 969, 980-981. As  to the causes of action for fraud, IIED, and NIED, the court notes these are  inadequately pled for the reasons noted below. As to the causes of action for  conversion, theft, unjust enrichment, and constructive trust, the court notes the  Cross-Complaint does allege facts against Chen as it alleges Chen participated  in the conversion of Fiorano Motorsport’s assets. (Cross-complaint, ¶ 28, 86,  90-91, 105.) And last, the court notes the causes of action for declaratory  relief and interference with prospective economic relations arise from  allegations of controversy or wrongful conduct that incorporate all of the  above allegations, including allegations against Chen. Accordingly,  M Capital and Chen’s demurrer is SUSTAINED IN PART as to Bianco Corsa, Yokohama, and Li. It is  also OVERRULED  IN PART as  to the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, twelfth, and thirteenth causes of  action against Chen and SUSTAINED IN PART as to the remaining causes of action against  Chen. Breach of Contract (First and Second Causes of Action) M  Capital and Chen contend Defendants’ first and second causes of action for  breach of contract fail because the alleged contracts are unenforceable. The court  disagrees as to the first cause of action and agrees as to the second cause of  action. Legal Standard To  state a cause of action for breach of contract, a plaintiff must be able to  establish “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or  excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting  damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51  Cal.4th 811, 821.) If a breach of contract claim “is based on alleged breach of  a written contract, the terms must be set out verbatim in the body of the  complaint or a copy of the written agreement must be attached and incorporated  by reference.” (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74  Cal.App.4th 299, 307.) In some circumstances, a plaintiff may also “plead the  legal effect of the contract rather than its precise language.” (Construction  Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189,  198-199.) “[T]he vital elements of a cause of action based on contract are  mutual assent (usually accomplished through the medium of an offer and  acceptance) and consideration.” (Division of Labor Law Enforcement v.  Transpacific Transportation Co. (1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 268, 275.) Alleged Breach of Member Interest Purchase and Sale  Agreement In  the first cause of action, the Cross-Complaint alleges Li and M Capital entered  into an agreement for the purchase of a forty-nine percent (49%) interest in  Fiorano Motorsport. (Cross-Complaint, ¶ 42.) The Cross-Complaint alleges the  agreement was memorialized in writings entitled “Member Interest Purchase and  Sale Agreement” and “Supplementary Agreements” on August 12, 2021.  (Cross-Complaint, ¶ 43.) The Cross-Complaint further alleges that M Capital and  Chen breached the agreement by demanding a return of their funds. (Cross-Complaint,  ¶ 49.) M  Capital and Chen first contend the parol evidence rule requires the membership  purchase agreement and supplementary agreements to be viewed separately.  (Demurrer, p. 10:13-11:19.) The parol evidence rule “exclude[s] evidence of a  prior or contemporaneous agreement that contradicts the terms of an integrated  writing.” (Take Me Home Rescue v. Luri (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 1342, 1351.)  But the present case does not involve evidence of a prior or contemporaneous  agreement as the Cross-Complaint alleges both writings are part of the same  agreement. (Moore v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.4th 634, 638 [a demurrer  admits all properly pled material facts].) Thus, the court finds the rule is  inapplicable here. M  Capital and Chen next contend the public policy of avoiding forfeiture requires  the membership purchase agreement and supplementary agreements to be viewed  separately. (Demurrer, p. 11:23-12:13.) But while M Capital and Chen cite Ballard  v. MacCallum (1940) 15 Cal.2d 439, 444, for the rule that interpretations  resulting in forfeiture must be avoided, they fail to demonstrate how this rule  compels the court to treat the entire Supplementary Agreements as a separate  agreement. Last,  M Capital and Chen contend the Supplementary Agreements’ forfeiture provision  is unenforceable as a matter of public policy. (Demurrer, p. 12:16-13:14.) In  support, they cite D. A. Parrish & Sons v. County Sanitation Dist. No. 4  of Santa Clara County (1959) 174 Cal.App.2d 406, for the rule that “a  forfeiture clause . . . will not only be strictly construed [Citation] but has  been interpreted by this court not to apply to claims arising from breaches of  the contract caused by the other party.” (Id., at p. 414.) Relying on  this rule, M Capital and Chen contend enforcement of the forfeiture provision  would allow Defendants to exonerate themselves from their own wrongful conduct.  But the Cross-Complaint does not allege the Defendants committed any wrongful  conduct and instead alleges Li “performed each and every covenant and condition  to be performed by him under the agreement.” (Cross-Complaint, ¶ 48.) Thus, on  the face of the pleadings, M Capital and Chen’s unenforceability arguments  fail. Accordingly,  M Capital and Chen’s demurrer to this cause of action is OVERRULED. Alleged Breach of Operating Agreement In  the second cause of action, the Cross-Complaint alleges Li presented a new  operating agreement for Fiorano Motorsport to M Capital and Chen on June 8,  2022. (Cross-Complaint, ¶ 52.) In September 2023, the Cross-Complaint alleges M  Capital failed to perform pursuant to the operating agreement by failing to  divide assets for Li’s benefit or render Li financially secure. (Cross-Complaint,  ¶ 54.) M Capital and Chen contend the operating agreement is unenforceable  because it was never signed or ratified by the parties. (Demurrer, p. 13:20-25.)  The court agrees and notes the Cross-Complaint does not even allege the  operating agreement was enacted or ratified, and instead alleges Li “presented”  the operating agreement to M Capital and Chen. (Cross-Complaint, ¶ 30, 52.) Because  there are no allegations establishing how the parties entered into or adopted  the operating agreement, this cause of action is insufficiently pled. Accordingly,  M Capital and Chen’s demurrer to this cause of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. Breach of Fiduciary Duty (Third Cause of Action) M  Capital and Chen maintain Defendants’ third cause of action for breach of  fiduciary duty fails because it does not establish M Capital and Chen owed a  fiduciary duty to Defendants. The court agrees. Legal Standard The  elements of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty are the existence of  a fiduciary relationship, breach of fiduciary duty, and damages.” (Oasis  West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 820.)¿“A fiduciary  relation in law is ordinarily synonymous with a confidential relation. It is  also founded upon the trust or confidence reposed by one person in the  integrity and fidelity of another, and likewise precludes the idea of profit or  advantage resulting from the dealings of the parties and the person in whom the  confidence is reposed.” (Rickel v. Schwinn Bicycle Co. (1983) 144  Cal.App.3d 648, 654, quoting Bacon v. Soule (1912) 19 Cal.App. 428,  434.) “Traditional examples of fiduciary relationships in the commercial  context include trustee/beneficiary, directors and majority shareholders of a  corporation, business partners, joint adventurers, and agent/principal.” (Wolf  v. Superior Court (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 25, 30.) Discussion In  this case, the Cross-Complaint alleges M Capital and Chen owed a fiduciary duty  to Fiorano Motorsport and Li as a result of agreeing to work together.  (Cross-Complaint, ¶ 58.) M Capital and Chen maintain M Capital and Chen’s  membership in an LLC is insufficient to establish fiduciary obligations  pursuant to Corporations Code section 17704.09. (Demurrer, p. 15:14-16:4.)  Corporations Code section 17704.09, subdivision (f)(3) provides “a member does  not have any fiduciary duty to the limited liability company or to any other  member solely by reason of being a member” in a manager-managed LLC. Here,  M Capital and Chen point to a copy of Fiorano Motorsport’s 2020 articles of  organization which state the LLC is a structured as a “one manager” entity. (M  Capital and Chen RJN, Ex. A.) But this filing does not establish if Fiorano  Motorsport was still organized as a manager-managed LLC from August 2021 to 2022.  (Cross-Complaint, ¶ 15.) The Cross-Complaint is also silent on this issue  although it suggests Li was responsible for managing Fiorano Motorsport. (Cross-Complaint,  ¶ 58.) Because Corporations Code section 17704.09 governs the fiduciary duties  of LLC members and the Cross-Complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to  establish its applicability, the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty  is insufficiently pled. To the extent Defendants claim in their opposition that  the agreements between the parties created a fiduciary relationship, they have  failed to allege and point to the specific provisions that do so. (Opp., p. 7:1-6.) Accordingly,  M Capital and Chen’s demurrer to this cause of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. Fraud Causes of Action (Fourth and Fifth Causes of  Action) M  Capital and Chen argue Defendants’ fourth cause of action for fraud and fifth  cause of action for fraudulent inducement fail because they are not alleged  with the required specificity. The court agrees. Legal Standard “The  elements of fraud, which give rise to the tort action for deceit, are (a)  misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b)  knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce  reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Lazar v.  Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 638, quoting 5 Witkin, Summary of  Cal. Law (9th ed. 1988) Torts, § 676, p. 778.) Furthermore, the facts  constituting the alleged fraud must be alleged factually and specifically as to  every element of fraud, as the policy of “liberal construction” of the  pleadings will not ordinarily be invoked. (Id., at p. 645.) In alleging  a cause of action for fraud, “[t]he specificity requirement means a plaintiff  must allege facts showing how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the  representations were made, and, in the case of a corporate defendant, the  plaintiff must allege the names of the persons who made the representations,  their authority to speak on behalf of the corporation, to whom they spoke, what  they said or wrote, and when the representation was made.” (West v. JPMorgan  Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 793.) Discussion In  this case, the Cross-Complaint alleges that during “face-to-face meetings, text  messages, and phone calls from May 2021 to August 2021[, M Capital and Chen]  made representations to [Defendants] promising they would become a 49%-member  of [Fiorano Motorsport].” (Cross-Complaint, ¶ 64.) M Capital and Chen argue  this allegation is not pled with the required specificity. (Demurrer, p.  16:22-26.) The court agrees as it does not specifically allege who made each  representation alleged on M Capital and Chen’s behalf, what was said in each representation,  to whom each representation was made, how each representation was made, and  when each representation was made. Furthermore,  the representation alleged—the promise to become a member of Fiorano  Motorsport—does not constitute a representation as “an actionable misrepresentation  must be made about past or existing facts; statements regarding future events  are merely deemed opinions.” (San Francisco Design Center Associates v.  Portman Companies (1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 29, 44.) And to the extent the  Cross-Complaint alleges this statement was a false promise, the  Cross-Complaint’s own allegations contradict this as they do allege M Capital  and Chen became members of Fiorano Motorsport. (Complaint, ¶ 23-24.) Accordingly,  M Capital and Chen’s demurrer to these causes of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. Conversion, Unjust Enrichment, Theft, and Constructive  Trust Causes of Action (Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Causes of Action) M  Capital and Chen contend Defendants’ sixth cause of action for conversion,  seventh cause of action for unjust enrichment, eighth cause of action for  theft, and ninth cause of action for constructive trust fail because the  Cross-Complaint fails to allege Defendants had possessory or ownership rights  in their alleged assets. (Demurrer, p. 17:9-18:3.) M Capital and Chen attempt  to contradict the allegations of the Cross-Complaint with evidence from retail  certificates of receipt and a prior declaration by Li. But for the reasons  noted above, the court declines to take judicial notice of these retail  certificates of receipt. And  to the extent M Capital and Chen point to Li’s declaration, the court notes  they misrepresent what was stated. The Cross-Complaint alleges Li wired  $1,700,332.00 from Fiorano Motorsport’s bank account for the purchase of a 2021  Koenigsegg Regera on October 4, 2021. (Cross-Complaint, ¶ 21.) M Capital and Li  suggest this allegation is contradicted by Li’s statement in a declaration that  the $1.7 million came from Chen. (Demurrer, p. 17:19-18:1.) Specifically, Li  stated Chen wired $1,700,000.00 into Fiorano Motorsport’s account on October 1,  2021. (RJN, Ex. C, ¶ 9.) But in the next paragraph, Li states Li “paid the  remaining balance of $1,700,332.00” on October 4, 2021. (RJN, Ex. C, ¶ 10.)  Thus, M Capital and Chen’s contention here is without merit. Accordingly,  M Capital and Chen’s demurrer to these causes of action is OVERRULED. Declaratory Relief (Tenth Cause of Action) M  Capital and Chen maintain Defendants’ tenth cause of action for declaratory  relief fails because no controversy was specified. The court disagrees. Legal Standard “To  qualify for declaratory relief, a party would have to demonstrate its action  presented two essential elements: (1) a proper subject of declaratory relief,  and (2) an actual controversy involving justiciable questions relating to the  party’s rights or obligations.” (Jolley v. Chase Home Finance, LLC (2013)  213 Cal.App.4th 872, 909, quotation marks and brackets omitted.) “The courts do  not issue advisory opinions about the rights and duties of the parties under  particular agreements, if no actual, justiciable controversy has yet  developed.” (Otay Land Co. v. Royal Indemnity Co. (2008) 169 Cal.App.4th  556, 563.) Discussion In  this case, the Cross-Complaint alleges the existence of a controversy by  referencing and incorporating all previous allegations in the Cross-Complaint.  (Cross-Complaint, ¶ 107-108.) M Capital and Chen fail to address this  allegation. And to the extent they maintain this cause of action fails on the  same grounds as the first and second causes of action, this argument fails for  the reasons noted previously. (Demurrer, p. 18:5-17.) Accordingly,  M Capital and Chen’s demurrer to this cause of action is OVERRULED. Injunctive Relief (Eleventh Cause of Action) M  Capital and Chen argue Defendants’ eleventh cause of action for injunctive  relief fails because it is not a cause of action. (Demurrer, p. 18:21-25.) In  support, they cite Allen v. City of Sacramento (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th  41, where the court held a trial court did not err in sustaining a demurrer to  a cause of action for injunctive relief because “injunctive relief is a remedy,  not a cause of action.” (Id., at p. 65.) In opposition, Defendants fail  to address this issue and point to any contrary authority. Accordingly,  M Capital and Chen’s demurrer to this cause of action is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. Interference with Prospective Economic Relations (Twelfth  and Thirteenth Causes of Action) M  Capital and Chen contend Defendants’ twelfth cause of action for intentional  interference with prospective economic relations and thirteenth cause of action  for negligent interference with prospective economic relations fail because the  Cross-Complaint does not allege any wrongful interference. The court disagrees. Legal Standard To  state a cause of action for intentional interference with prospective economic  advantage or relations, a plaintiff must establish: “(1) a relationship between  the plaintiff and some third party with the probability of future economic  benefit to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant's knowledge of the relationship;  (3) a wrongful act, apart from the interference itself, by the defendant  designed to disrupt the relationship;¿(4) actual disruption of the  relationship; and (5) economic harm to the plaintiff proximately caused by the  acts of the defendant.”¿ (Salma v. Capon (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1275,  1290, quoting Arluk Medical Center Industrial Group, Inc. v. Dobler (2004)  116 Cal.App.4th 1324, 1340-1341.) “The  elements of negligent interference with contract or prospective economic  advantage are (1) the existence of a valid contractual relationship or other  economic relationship between the plaintiff and a third party containing the  probability of future economic benefit to the plaintiff; (2) the defendant's  knowledge (actual or construed) of the relationship; (3) the defendant's  knowledge (actual or construed) that the relationship would be disrupted if the  defendant failed to act with reasonable care; (4) the defendant's failure to  act with reasonable care; (5) actual disruption of the relationship; and (6)  resulting economic harm.” (Nelson v. Tucker Ellis, LLP (2020) 48  Cal.App.5th 827, 844, fn. 5.) In  addition to establishing the defendant interfered with a plaintiff’s  prospective economic advantage, plaintiff must establish that defendant’s  conduct “was wrongful by some legal measure other than the fact of interference  itself.” (Della Penna v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (1995) 11  Cal.4th 376, 393.)¿“To establish that the defendant's interfering conduct was¿independently¿wrongful,  the plaintiff must instead prove that the conduct—whether directed at the  plaintiff or someone else—was ‘proscribed by some constitutional, statutory,  regulatory, common law, or other determinable legal standard.’” (Drink Tank  Ventures LLC v. Real Soda in Real Bottles, Ltd. (2021) 71 Cal.App.5th 528,  538, quoting Ixchel Pharma, LLC v. Biogen, Inc. (2020) 9 Cal.5th 1130,  1142.) Discussion In  this case, the Cross-Complaint alleges M Capital and Chen engaged in wrongful  conduct. (Cross-Complaint, ¶ 119.) M Capital and Chen contend this allegation  fails to allege any facts establishing why this conduct was wrongful.  (Demurrer, p. 19:19-24.) But in the thirteenth cause of action for negligent  interference with prospective economic relations, the Cross-Complaint provided  further detail by alleging M Capital and Chen engaged in wrongful conduct  through breach of contract, misrepresentation, and fraud. (Cross-Complaint, ¶  128.) Furthermore, as with the tenth cause of action for declaratory relief,  these allegations also incorporate all previous allegations. (Cross-Complaint,  ¶ 117, 122.) M Capital and Chen fail to address these other allegations. Accordingly,  M Capital and Chen’s demurrer to these causes of action is OVERRULED. IIED and NIED (Fourteenth and Fifteenth Causes of  Action) M  Capital and Chen maintain Defendants’ fourteenth cause of action for IIED and  fifteenth cause of action NIED fail because the Cross-Complaint does not allege  sufficiently outrageous conduct. The court agrees. Legal Standard To  establish a claim of IIED, one must show “(1) extreme and outrageous conduct by  the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the  probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff’s suffering  severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of  the emotional distress by the defendant’s outrageous conduct.” (Wilson v.  Hynek (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 999, 1009, quoting Cervantez v. J.C. Penney  Co. (1979) 24 Cal.3d 579, 593.) Extreme and outrageous conduct is defined  as exceeding “all bounds of decency usually tolerated by a decent society” and  intending to cause mental distress. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989)  214 Cal.App.3d 590, 618.) A  plaintiff may recover for negligent infliction of emotional distress on the  bystander theory—plaintiff can “recover damages for serious emotional distress  suffered as a result of an injury to a close family member” if plaintiff was  present and aware of the injury being caused—or the direct victim  theory—plaintiff can recover damages for emotional distress caused by a  defendant who already owed plaintiff a legal duty. (Gu v. BMW of North  America, LLC (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 195, 204.) Discussion In  this case, the Cross-Complaint alleges M Capital and Chen’s failure to  contribute to their share of Fiorano Motorsport’s operating expenses causes a  breakdown of their relationship with Li and harm to Fiorano Motorsport’s  financial condition. (Cross-Complaint, ¶ 35.) The Cross-Complaint alleges this  breakdown and financial difficulty caused “severe stress and mental anguish.”  (Cross-Complaint, ¶ 35.) The Cross-Complaint also alleges Li was afraid and  stressed out from receiving anonymous texts and written warnings to stay away  from and stop contacting Chen. (Cross-Complaint, ¶ 38-39.) As  to the first allegations, M Capital and Chen maintain these allegations do not  establish outrageous conduct. (Demurrer, p. 20:12-14.) The court agrees as an  alleged failure to comply with one’s contractual or business obligations hardly  rises to the level of conduct exceeding “all bounds of decency usually  tolerated by a decent society.” (Id., at p. 618.) And Defendants do not  point to a single case in their opposition that has held so. (Opp., p. 14:15-15:2.)  With regards to the second set of allegations, the court also agrees that  anonymous warnings to stay away from Chen do not constitute outrageous conduct.  (Demurrer, p. 20:14-17.) And even if they did, the Cross-Complaint does not  allege who was responsible for sending these messages. Furthermore, the  Cross-Complaint fails to allege Li’s stress and emotional distress was severe.  (Hailey v. California Physicians’ Service (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 452,  476 [“Generally, a plaintiff may not recover for intentional infliction of  emotional distress unless the distress suffered has been severe.”].) Accordingly,  M Capital and Chen’s demurrer to these causes of action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, M  Capital and Chen’s demurrer to Defendants’ Cross-Complaint is SUSTAINED IN  PART without leave to amend as to the eleventh cause of action and with  twenty (20) days leave to amend as to all causes of action brought by Bianco  Corsa, Yokohama, and Li, as well as the second, third,  fourth, fifth, fourteenth, and fifteenth causes of action. The demurrer  is OVERRULED IN PART as to the first, sixth,  seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, twelfth, and thirteenth causes of action. Based on the above analysis, M Capital’s motion  to strike portions of Defendants’ Cross-Complaint is deemed MOOT.
