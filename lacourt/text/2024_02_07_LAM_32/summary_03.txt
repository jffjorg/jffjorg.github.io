And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has reviewed the defendants' motion for reconsideration of the Court's December 6 order denying their motion to dismiss. The defendants seek to reconsider the order based on the California Supreme Court's grant of review in Giblin v. Lockton Cos., LLC – Pacific Series, et al., which they claim will provide dispositive guidance on the enforcement of the forum selection clause at issue. However, the defendants' deadline to file a petition for writ of mandate challenging the order has already passed, and they have already filed their petition. Therefore, the issue is moot.

Additionally, the defendants request a stay pending the resolution of Giblin, but the Supreme Court's grant of review is related to a different case, EpicentRx, Inc. v. Superior Court, which concerns a nonwaivable statutory right. It is unlikely that the Supreme Court would reach a decision in Giblin with a dispositive effect on the present case.

Based on these findings, the Court denies the defendants' motion for reconsideration.
