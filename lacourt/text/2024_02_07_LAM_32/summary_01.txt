And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to withdraw from arbitration. The plaintiff had filed the motion after the defendant failed to pay an invoice for $23,700 in arbitrator's compensation by the statutory deadline. The judge finds that the defendant's failure to pay the invoice constitutes a material breach of the arbitration agreement, which gives the plaintiff the unilateral right to withdraw from arbitration. The judge notes that the defendant has expressed its intention not to pay the invoice and has not disputed the facts of the case. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's motion to withdraw from arbitration is granted, and the matter will proceed in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
