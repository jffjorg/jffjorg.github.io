  Case No.:  20STCV44744
  Hearing Date:  February 7, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to withdraw from
  arbitration 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On November 23, 2020, Plaintiff Chris
Mills filed this employment action against Defendant Facility Solutions Group,
Inc. 
            On February 8, 2021, the Court
granted Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration. Arbitration began in August
2021. On March 29, 2023, AAA issued an invoice for $23,700 to Defendant, with a
deadline of October 24, 2023. To date, Defendant has not paid the arbitrator
fee. 
            On January 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to withdraw from arbitration. Defendant filed a notice of
non-opposition on January 25, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“In an employment
or consumer arbitration that requires . . . the drafting party to pay certain
fees and costs before the arbitration can proceed, if the fees or costs to
initiate an arbitration proceeding are not paid within 30 days after the due
date, the drafting party is in material breach of the arbitration agreement, is
in default of the arbitration, and waives its right to compel arbitration under
Section 1281.2.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.97(a)(1).) “If the drafting party
materially breaches the arbitration agreement and is in default under
subdivision (a), the employee or consumer may . . . [w]ithdraw the claim from
arbitration and proceed in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.” (Id., subd. (b).)
The same applies to fees assessed during the pendency of an arbitration. (Id., § 1281.98.) 
The statute is applied
strictly, and the Court may not consider any other factors or mitigating circumstances.
(Espinoza v. Superior Court (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 761, 775-76; DeLeon
v. Juanita Foods (2022) 85 Cal.App.5th 740, 749.) A drafting party
is in breach of the arbitration agreement simply if it does not pay the
requisite fees within thirty days. 
DISCUSSION
            On
March 29, 2023, AAA issued an invoice to the parties to pay $23,700 in arbitrator’s
compensation. (Berenji Decl. ¶ 7, Ex. B.) The invoice imposed a deadline of
October 24, 2023. (Ibid.) On October 26, 2023, AAA emailed the parties to remind them that
payment was due thirty days from the deadline per statute, or November 24, 2023
in this case. (Id., Ex. C.) On November 29, 2023, AAA notified the parties that it still
had not received the required deposits. (Id., ¶ 9.) Defendant has expressed that it will not pay the invoice. (Id., ¶ 13.) The
parties were unable to agree on the specifics of a stipulation to withdraw the
matter from arbitration. (Id., ¶ 10; Ayers Decl. ¶¶ 5-6.) 
            Defendant
has filed a notice of non-opposition and does not dispute any of the foregoing
facts. The undisputed facts show that Defendant materially breached the arbitration
agreement by failing to pay the requisite fees by the statutory deadline. Therefore,
Plaintiff has the unilateral right to withdraw the matter from arbitration, without
consideration of any other facts.    
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s
motion to withdraw from arbitration is GRANTED.
