And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel compliance with the subpoena served on Ustaffing Support Inc. (Ustaffing). The subpoena seeks Decedent's employment records from January 1, 2012 to present, which are relevant to the plaintiffs' claims of loss of earning capacity and financial support due to Decedent's death. The judge finds that there is good cause for the production of these records and that Ustaffing's refusal to produce them is unreasonable. The judge also awards sanctions against Ustaffing in the amount of $1,100, to be paid within 30 days, due to the company's failure to provide a substantial justification for its refusal to comply with the subpoena.
