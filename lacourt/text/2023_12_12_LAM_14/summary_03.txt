And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the joint motion of the parties to continue the trial date for 90 days. The motion was based on three grounds: the need to take additional depositions, the need for experts to review certain data, and the need for mediation. The Judge found that none of these reasons was sufficient to justify the continuance of the case. The Judge noted that the parties failed to provide sufficient information about which depositions were needed and why they had not already occurred. The Judge also found that the delay in producing data for expert review was not justified, and that expert discovery is typically completed in the final month before trial. Finally, the Judge concluded that a general desire to mediate was not a sufficient reason to continue the case, which is almost 7 years old and has already been mistried once.
