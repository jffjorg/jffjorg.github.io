And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Defendant Manhattan Loft, which challenges the sufficiency of the facts in the Plaintiff's complaint. The judge finds that the demurrer is sustained, meaning that the Plaintiff must re-file their complaint with additional information to support their claims. Specifically, the judge orders the Plaintiff to combine their fifth and eighth causes of action, which are both based on negligence, into a single claim. The defendant is also ordered to file an answer to the amended complaint within 10 days.

Additionally, the judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike paragraph 6 of the prayer in the complaint, which requests restitution. The judge finds that the defendant failed to meet their burden to support the motion, and that the motion was based on an unpublished trial court decision that the court cannot consider.
