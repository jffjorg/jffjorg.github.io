And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Inpala's motion to compel Mary Ghermezian, the plaintiff, to attend a deposition. The motion is unopposed, and the judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to timely object to the deposition notices or appear at scheduled depositions is grounds for granting the motion. The judge also grants Inpala's request for monetary sanctions against the plaintiff and her attorney, Raymond Ghermezian, in the reduced amount of $600.00. The plaintiff is ordered to appear for deposition within 20 days of the issuance of this order and to pay the monetary sanctions within the same time frame.
