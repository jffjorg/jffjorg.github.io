NOTICE TO STATE AGENCIES WHEN PROPOSED TRUST IS AN SNT:

of the hearing and service of the petition must be made upon three state
agencies including the Dept. of Mental Health, Dept. of Developmental Services,
and Dept. of Health Care Services.

service for state agencies of the revised petition and the hearing should be
continued for proper service (15 days by mail). 
  
 
PLAINTIFF:     
 
Jose Sierra, age 26, disabled
 
PETITIONER:               
 
Maria Sierra, parent and GAL
 
GROSS AND NET SETTLEMENT (Petition, p. 6, sections 15 and
16f):            
 
Gross $4 million, Net $1,573,520.54
 
PROPOSED RECIPIENT OF SETTLEMENT PROCEEDS (Petition, pp.
8-9, sec. 18):
 
Petitioner proposes to fund $573,520.54 cash into a special
needs trust (SNT) and use the remaining $1 million to purchase an annuity that
would pay into the SNT at:
 
Commencing 2/20/2024, $4,855.42 payable monthly, guaranteed
for 30 years and life thereafter, last guaranteed payment on 1/20/54
(Attachment 18b(3) to 11/30/24 supplemental filing, court’s pdf at p. 3.)
 
An SNT is used to receive the settlement funds in these situations
so that plaintiff does not lose benefits eligibility for Medi-Cal, SSI, and
other benefits.  Historically, a person
receiving Medi-Cal or SSI benefits could have only up to $2,000 in non-exempt
assets, and any additional non-exempt assets over $2,000 would cause the loss
of benefits eligibility under the relevant federal and state law.  Funds held in a valid SNT, however, are
exempt assets that do not count toward the $2,000 asset limit for purposes of
calculating benefits eligibility.  On
July 1, 2022, the Medi-Cal asset qualification limit was raised to $130,000 for
individuals while the asset qualification for other benefits, like SSI, did not
change.  
 
BRIEFING REGARDING TRUST ISSUES:
 
Petitioner did not provide briefing regarding trust issues.
 
PROPOSED TRUST INSTRUMENT:
 
Petitioner provides the proposed trust instrument at Attachment
18b(4), court’s pdf at p. 135.
 
The main requirements for court created or funded trusts are
set forth at California Rules of Court (CRC) rule 7.903(c) and LASC rule
4.116(b).  The proposed trust
instrument meets the requirements of CRC rule 7.903(c).  
 
However, the proposed trust instrument does not contain the
following terms as required by LASC rule 4.116(b), labelled by quoted
subsection, and the court thus continues the hearing for a revised proposed
SNT instrument:
 
(b)(4) The trustee may not borrow
money, lend money, give security, lease, convey, or exchange any property of
the estate without prior authorization of the court. (Prob. Code, § 2550.)
 
FINDINGS WHEN THE PROPOSED TRUST IS AN SNT:
 
When approving the establishment or funding of a SNT from
settlement proceeds, the court must and hereby does make the following findings
pursuant to Probate Code section 3604(b) based on the factual allegations in
the Petition to Approve Compromise and its attachments supporting the
settlement that generally cover the requisite findings:
 

The SNT beneficiary has a
     disability which substantially impairs the individual’s ability to provide
     for her own care or custody and constitutes a substantial handicap;
The SNT beneficiary is
     likely to have special needs that will not be met without the trust; 
The money to be paid to
     the trust does not exceed the amount that appears reasonably necessary to
     meet the SNT beneficiary’s special needs.

 
TRUSTE AND BOND:
 
The proposed initial trustees are LeeAnn Hitchman and Brett
Hitchman, private professional fiduciaries (PPFs).
 
The proposed trustees do not meet the definition of a
corporate fiduciary and bond should be required.  Petitioner does not state a bond request.  A proper bond calculation based upon the
assets to be funded into the trust, plus anticipated annual income from
investments and any annuity, plus an additional amount required for the costs
of any recovery on the bond, would be $730,000.  The court requires $730,000 bond submitted by
trustee to this department (which will later be resubmitted to the Probate
court in any trust supervision action).    

 
ORDERS/PROPOSED ORDER:
 
Proposed Order received stamp date:  None Submitted for the current (revised)
petition.  A new proposed order is
required to capture the proposed SNT instrument, annuity, etc.  Need proposed order for review prior to the next
hearing.
