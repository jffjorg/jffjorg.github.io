And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant City's motion to compel ASM's compliance with a deposition subpoena for production of business records. The motion is denied in its entirety due to the vagueness and ambiguity of the subpoena requests. The subpoena seeks production of documents related to asphalt work, landscaping work, and barriers located at or near the location of the incident, but the terms "location" and "near" are not clearly defined. The judge finds that the subpoena requests were not drafted with sufficient care and are therefore unclear and overly broad. As a result, the motion to compel compliance with the subpoena is denied, and Defendant City is ordered to give notice.
