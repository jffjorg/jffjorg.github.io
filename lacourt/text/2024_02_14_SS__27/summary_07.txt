The Judge notes that the Petition contains inconsistencies in the numbers, particularly in paragraphs 12, 13, and 16. Despite these inconsistencies, the Judge's calculations match the net balance of proceeds payable to the Claimant, which totals $106,573.44. The Court's review of the Petition is ongoing, and the Judge will likely issue a final ruling after further review.
