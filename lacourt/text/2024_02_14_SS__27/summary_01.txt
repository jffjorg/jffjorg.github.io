English-text summary:

Judge Lee S. Arian has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for protective order regarding the designation of expert witnesses in a case involving a bus accident. The motion was filed by Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) and is opposed by Plaintiff Richard Ian Rayner. The Court finds that LACMTA has not shown good cause for issuance of the requested protective order and therefore denies the motion. The Court concludes that LACMTA's request is too restrictive and that Plaintiff Rayner has complied with the relevant discovery statutes. The case will proceed with the original designation of expert witnesses.
