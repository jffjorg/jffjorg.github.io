Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for substitution of the personal representative of the deceased plaintiff, Tomas Jesus Martinez. The motion was filed by Plaintiff's counsel, Michael Yadegari, on behalf of Domitila Martinez, the deceased plaintiff's widow. The motion was unopposed, but the court denied it without prejudice due to the incomplete declaration filed by Domitila Martinez. The declaration failed to include required information, such as the location of the deceased plaintiff's death and the fact that no other person has a superior right to commence the action or proceeding. The court ordered the moving party to give notice and directed the parties to submit on the tentative if they intend to do so. The hearing is scheduled for February 14, 2024.
