Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the information presented in the petition to approve compromise and its attachments. The court will not approve the creation and funding of the proposed trust until certain corrections are made. The judge will make the required findings under Probate Code section 3604(b) and require a trustee bond of $730,000. The hearing will be continued for 15 days to allow for proper service of the revised petition and to give the parties an opportunity to submit a revised proposed SNT instrument. The judge will also require a new proposed order to capture the proposed SNT instrument, annuity, and other details.
