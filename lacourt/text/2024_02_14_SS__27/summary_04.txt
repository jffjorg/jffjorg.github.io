And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Hon. Lee S. Arian in a civil lawsuit between Arman Dayan (Plaintiff) and Stanley Schuster (Defendant). The lawsuit arises from a pedestrian and motor vehicle collision on May 7, 2019. On October 17, 2023, Defendant filed a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission. Plaintiff objected to the motion, and a hearing was held on January 29, 2024.

The Court finds that Defendant's motion is timely and that Defendant has satisfied its obligation to meet and confer. The Court grants Defendant's motion as to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1 and Special Interrogatory Nos. 148, 149, 189, 190, and 193, but denies it as to Special Interrogatory Nos. 55, 58, and 61.

The Court also grants Defendant's motion to compel further responses to Requests for Admission No. 10 and Requests for Production Nos. 13 and 14, but notes that the motion is moot as to the latter two requests. The Court orders Plaintiff to provide further responses to the requests for which the motions were granted within 20 days of the issuance of this order.

The Court notes that there are no requests for sanctions and that any party who intends to submit on this tentative ruling must send an email to the Court.
