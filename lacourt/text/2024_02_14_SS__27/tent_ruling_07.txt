[1] Petitioner’s counsel indicates
that Petitioner has changed her last name to Allin. (Ercolani Decl., ¶ 4.)


[2] The Court notes that paragraph
16 of the Petition totals numbers on the left side of the column in a way that is
somewhat confusing. For example, paragraph 12, subdivisions (a)(4) and (a)(5)
list medical expenses for reimbursement as totaling $15,614.53 and statutory or
contractual liens as $6,457.58, but paragraph 16, subdivision (b) lists only
$3,124.25.  (Petition, ¶¶ 12, subd.
(a), 16.)  The non-medical expenses
section under paragraph 16, subdivision (d) lists $18,947.86, but paragraph 13,
subdivision (b), lists only $2,604.45 in non-medical expenses.  (Petition, ¶¶13, subd. (b), 16.)  Petitioner also seems to have combined
litigation expenses with the attorney’s fees in paragraph 16, subdivision
(c).  (Petition, ¶ 16, subd. (c).)  Nevertheless, the net balance of proceeds
payable to Claimant still adds up to $106,573.44, which matches the Court’s
calculations.
