Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion by the defendants to exclude the expert witness testimony of Dr. Gersh, who is being represented by the plaintiff. The motion is based on the defendants' assertion that the plaintiff has failed to comply with the expert witness exchange requirements, specifically by not making Dr. Gersh available for deposition and not producing her reports and writings. The court finds that the plaintiff's conduct is unreasonable and grants the motion to exclude Dr. Gersh's expert witness testimony. The court notes that the plaintiff has not provided a satisfactory explanation for their failure to make Dr. Gersh available for deposition and that the defendants have been flexible in scheduling depositions, but the plaintiff has not reciprocated. The court also finds that the plaintiff's attempt to depose Dr. Gersh after the close of expert discovery is counterproductive to their argument.
