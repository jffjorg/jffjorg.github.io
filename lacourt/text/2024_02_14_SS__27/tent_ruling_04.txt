I.           
          INTRODUCTION
On May 15, 2020, Plaintiff Arman Dayan
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendant Stanley Schuster
(“Defendant”) arising from a May 7, 2019 pedestrian and motor vehicle
collision.   
          On October
17, 2023, Defendant filed the instant motions to compel further responses to
form interrogatories, special interrogatories, requests for production, and
requests for admission on November 22, 2022. An IDC was held on January 29,
2024 and the issues were not resolved. Thereafter, Plaintiff filed oppositions,
and Defendant replied. This ruling addresses all three motions. 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARDS
Under Code of Civil Procedure sections
2030.300, subdivision (a), Section 2031.310, and 2033.290 subdivision (a), parties
may move for a further response to interrogatories, requests for production of
documents, or requests for admission where an answer to the requests are
evasive or incomplete or where an objection is without merit or too general.
Notice of the motions must be given
within 45 days of service of the verified response, otherwise, the propounding
party waives any right to compel a further response. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.300, subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (c), 2033.290, subd. (c).)  The motions must also be accompanied by a meet
and confer declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b), 2031.310,
subd. (b), 2033.290, subd. (b).)  
Finally, Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1345 requires that all motions or responses involving further discovery
contain a separate statement with the text of each request, the response, and a
statement of factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses. (Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345, subd. (a)(3)). 
III.       
ANALYSIS
Timeliness
The Court finds that the motions are
timely made as the parties waived the motion cut-off date. The Court also finds
that Defendant have satisfied their obligation to meet and confer. 
Form Interrogatories
          Defendant
moves to compel Plaintiff’s further response to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1.
Plaintiff objects on the basis that an expert opinion is required. However, the
answers to the questions do not appear to require an expert opinion.
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED as to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1.
Special Interrogatories
Defendant moves to compel Plaintiff’s
further responses to Special Interrogatory Nos. 55, 58, 61, 148, 149, 189, 190,
193, and 196. 
          Nos. 55, 58,
and 61, ask Plaintiff what he said to Dr. Moussazadadeh. Defendant takes issue
with the statement “Plaintiff recalls indicating that as a result of the
incident, he found himself sitting on the ground.” Specifically, Defendant is
concerned about the word “indicating”. (See Reply.) Defendant argues
that this statement is ambiguous because Defendant cannot determine if
Plaintiff demonstrated some type of body movement, such as falling down or
stumbling backwards when he spoke to Dr. Moussazadeh about the incident. In
Defendant’s reply, he suggested deleting the offending word,
"indicating," or an amended response to clear up the ambiguity. (See
Reply.) The Court does not see how deleting the word “indicating” would clear
any ambiguity Defendant has, and further  such response would not be an answer to the
question. The question asks what Plaintiff said to Dr. Moussazadeh, and he
replies what he “indicated” to him; in the context of the question, “indicating”
is not ambiguous; it is in this instance synonymous with stating. Accordingly,
the motion is DENIED as to Special Interrogatory Nos.
55, 58, and 61. 
          As to Nos.
148, 149, 189, 190, 193, and 196, Plaintiff objects that it requires an expert
opinion. However, upon review of the requests, the objection is only valid as
to No. 196. The others only ask for facts such as the total amount of medical
bills, names, dates, addresses, and whether Plaintiff has a life care plan that
can be answered with a yes or no. Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED as to Special Interrogatory Nos. 148, 149, 189, 190, and 193,
and DENIED as to No. 196.
Requests for Admission
          Defendant
moves to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to Request for Admission No. 10.
The request asks Plaintiff to admit that he has not been informed by any
medical provider that he needs future surgery for the subject injuries. Plaintiff
objects on the basis that it seeks disclosure of expert opinion and is protected
by the work product doctrine and attorney client privilege until it becomes
clear that a specific expert will testify. 
However, the request does ask for a particular expert opinion, which may
implicate the work product doctrine.  Accordingly,
the motion is GRANTED.
Requests for Production
          Defendant
moves to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to Requests for Production Nos.
13 and 14 which request documents “referenced in Plaintiff’s Mediation Brief.”
Plaintiff objected on the basis that it is in violation of the mediation
privilege. In opposition, Plaintiff argues that given that qualifying phrase,
Defendant seeks material protected by the mediation privilege. In reply,
Defendant concedes to amending the request to delete any reference to the
mediation brief. As this omits the “qualifying phrase,” the motion is MOOT.
IV.    CONCLUSION
Defendant’s motion to compel further
responses to Interrogatories is GRANTED as to Form Interrogatory No. 17.1, and Special
Interrogatory Nos. 148, 149, 189, 190, and 193; and DENIED as to Special
Interrogatory Nos. 55, 58, 61, and 196. 
Defendant’s motion to compel further
responses to Requests for Admission is GRANTED.
Defendant’s motion to compel further
responses to Requests for Production is MOOT.
Plaintiff is ORDERED to provide further
responses to the requests for which the motions were granted within 20 days of
the issuance of this order. 
Additionally, Defendant is ORDERED to
pay an extra filing fee to the court as the motion to compel further responses
to interrogatories is actually two motions filed as one.
The Court notes that there are no
requests for sanctions.
