And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for a continuance of the trial, which is now set for March 25, 2024, at 9:00 am. The judge also sets a final status conference for March 14, 2024, at 10:00 am, where all counsel must appear in person with a physical courtesy copy of their completed trial binder. The judge strikes the Doe Amendment filed on October 5, 2023, and orders the plaintiff to file a corrected amendment within 5 days, to be served immediately after filing. Additionally, the judge sets an order to show cause (OSC) for the dismissal of all remaining Doe defendants for January 19, 2024, at 8:30 am. If the plaintiff voluntarily dismisses the remaining Doe defendants before that date, the hearing will be taken off-calendar and there will be no need to appear.
