And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has denied the motion to continue the trial for 60-90 days, despite the defense's argument that the counsel has a conflicting hearing on December 11, 2023. The Judge ruled that an obligation to appear in a different proceeding at a later date is not a sufficient basis to continue this proceeding. According to California Rules of Court Rule 3.1332, trial dates are to be treated as firm, but requests for continuances should be considered on an individual basis. The Judge concluded that the reason for continuance is not sufficient and therefore denied the motion.
