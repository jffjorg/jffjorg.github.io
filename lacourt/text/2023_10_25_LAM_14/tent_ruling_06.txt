 Case Number:  23STCV03363    Hearing Date:   October 25, 2023    Dept:  14 Instant Hearing
 
            Defendant Single
Grain now demurs, per Code of Civil Procedure §§ 430.10(e)-(f), to the
fourth cause of action[1] in
the complaint, on the grounds that it fails to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action and is barred by the economic loss rule.
 
Decision
 
            The
demurrer is SUSTAINED, with 7 days leave to amend.
 
Discussion
 
            To plead
promissory fraud, Plaintiff must plead only the promise with specificity; a
general statement about the promising party’s lack of intent to perform will
suffice. Beckwith v. Dahl (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 1039, 1060.
Here, even that general statement is missing. Paragraph 56 of the complaint alleges
only that a post-contractual IRS filing was made with intent to deceive the
plaintiff.
 
            The defect
can easily be amended. And a properly-pled promissory fraud claim would not be
barred by the economic loss rule. See Erlich v. Menezes (1999) 21 Cal.4th
543, 551-552.
