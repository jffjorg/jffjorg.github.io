Governing
Standard
 
“In determining the amount of
reasonable attorney fees to be awarded under a statutory attorney fees
provision, the trial court begins by calculating the ‘lodestar’ amount…[t]he
‘lodestar’ is ‘the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate.’ (Citation.) To determine the reasonable hourly rate, the court looks to
the ‘hourly rate prevailing in the community for similar work.’ (Citation.)
Using the lodestar as the basis for the attorney fee award ‘anchors the trial
court's analysis to an objective determination of the value of an attorney's
services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary. (Citation.)’” Bernardi
v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.
 
“Some federal courts require that an
attorney maintain and submit ‘contemporaneous, complete and standardized time
records which accurately reflect the work done by each attorney’ in support of
an application for attorney fees…[i]n California, an attorney need not submit
contemporaneous time records in order to recover attorney fees…[t]estimony of
an attorney as to the number of hours worked on a particular case is sufficient
evidence to support an award of attorney fees, even in the absence of detailed
time records.” Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559. “[A]n
award of attorney fees may be based on counsel's declarations, without
production of detailed time records.” Raining Data Corp. v. Barrenechea
(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1375. “‘“[P]adding’ in the form of inefficient
or duplicative efforts is not subject to compensation.’” Premier Medical
Management Systems, Inc. v. California Insurance Guarantee Association
(2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 556.
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff has submitted a detailed
billing statement as Exhibit 24 to the Declaration of Julian Moore. That
statement includes the work of no fewer than 16 individuals. However, Plaintiff
has only supplied supporting evidence for the qualifications and work of two:
Mr. Julian Moore and Mr. Joseph Kowalski. (Declaration of Julian Moore ¶ 23).
Therefore, only the hours of Mr. Moore and Mr. Kowalski will be reviewed and
awarded. See In re Marriage of Nassimi (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th
667, 695 (party seeking fees bears the burden of producing evidence to justify
the request); see also Morris v. Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41
Cal.App.5th 24, 39 & fn.7.
 
The records indicate that Mr. Moore
spent 17.8 hours at $515 per hour. They indicate that Mr. Kowalski spent 35.1
hours at $350 per hour. Plaintiff additionally seeks a flat fee of $5000 for preparing
the reply and appearing at the hearing for the instant motion.[1] Review
of the objections, as contained in the Opposition, reveals only one with merit.

 
The records indicate that Mr. Moore
spent 8.1 hours of his time preparing the moving papers. The addition of the
requested flat fee to this total would render the award connected with this
motion unreasonable. Ordinarily, 8.1 hours would be an appropriate amount of
time to spend on the whole fee motion, from drafting to argument. And the court
cannot simply award a flat fee; there is neither a way to properly calculate
it, nor a way for Defense to oppose it. Therefore, no flat fee will be awarded
and the 8.1 hours will stand as Plaintiff’s sole compensation for this motion.
 
Defense does not address the costs
issue at all, except to say that they plan to file a motion to tax Plaintiff’s
Memorandum of Costs pursuant to California Rules of Court Rule 3.1700(b). But
such a motion would be untimely under that same rule: a motion to tax must be
filed within 15 days of service of the motion to tax costs, plus an extra 2
days for electronic service. 
 
The cost memorandum was filed and served
on September 29, 2023. The last day for Plaintiff to challenge it was therefore
October 18, 2024. No such motion has been filed. Therefore, Defense has waived
their right to challenge costs.
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff is entitled to recover for 17.8 hours spent
by Mr. Moore at $515 per hour and 35.1 hours spent by Mr. Kowalski at $350 per
hour. That results in a total monetary amount of $21,452.00. Therefore, the
motion is GRANTED in part. Plaintiff is awarded attorneys’ fees of $21,452.00
and costs of $1,038.00.
