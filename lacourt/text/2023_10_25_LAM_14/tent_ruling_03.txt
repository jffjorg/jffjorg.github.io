 Case Number:  22STCV10358    Hearing Date:   October 25, 2023    Dept:  14 Instant Motion
 
Defendants Hospital and Jong now move
this court for an order continuing trial for 60-90 days.
 
Decision
 
            The motion is
DENIED.
 
Discussion 
 
California Rules of Court Rule 3.1332(a)
provides that trial dates are to be treated as firm. However, Rule 3.1332(c) provides
that, although continuances are “disfavored,” requests should be considered on
an individual basis. That subsection also includes a non-exhaustive list of
possible grounds for a continuance.
 
            Defense bases
their motion on the fact that counsel is representing a different client in a
hearing before an administrative body, which is set to commence on December 11,
2023.  This is not a sufficient reason for
a continuance. This case is set for trial on December 4, 2023. Should this case
go to trial on that date, counsel will be engaged here. Should this case not
proceed to trial on that date, counsel will be free to become engaged in the
other proceeding.        
 
Conclusion
 
            An
obligation to appear in a different proceeding at a later date is not a
sufficient basis to continue this proceeding. Therefore, the motion is DENIED.
