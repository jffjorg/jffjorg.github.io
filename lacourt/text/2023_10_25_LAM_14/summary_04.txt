And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the plaintiff's motion for an award of attorney's fees and costs, and has granted the motion in part. The plaintiff is awarded attorneys' fees of $21,452.00 and costs of $1,038.00. The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a flat fee of $5,000 for preparing the reply and appearing at the hearing, as the additional 8.1 hours spent on the motion would render the award unreasonable. The judge has also denied the defendant's opposition to the motion, as they failed to address the costs issue. The judge has waived the defendant's right to challenge the costs, as no motion to tax was filed within the statutory timeframe.
