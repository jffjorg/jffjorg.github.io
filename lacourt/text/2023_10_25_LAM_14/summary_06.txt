And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Single Grain, has filed a demurrer to the fourth cause of action in the complaint, arguing that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is barred by the economic loss rule. The judge agrees that the pleading is defective and sustains the demurrer with 7 days leave to amend. The judge notes that to plead promissory fraud, the plaintiff must plead only the promise with specificity, and that even a general statement about the promising party's lack of intent to perform will suffice. However, the complaint does not make such a statement. The judge believes that the defect can easily be amended, and that a properly-pled promissory fraud claim would not be barred by the economic loss rule.
