And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motion by Respondent Seno for attorney's fees in the amount of $20,880.00. The judge has sustained the objection to paragraph 6 of the Declaration of Eugene Lee, finding that the conduct of the Labor Commission hearing is irrelevant to the motion. The judge has overruled the objection to Exhibit 1 of the Declaration of Eugene Lee, finding that it is not an evidentiary objection.

The judge has granted the motion in part, awarding Respondent Seno $13,920.00 in fees. The judge has determined that Petitioner's appeal was unsuccessful, as the appeal was dismissed, and therefore Petitioner is liable for the fees and costs of Respondent Seno.

The judge has also addressed the issue of reasonable attorney's fees, taking into account the contingent nature of the litigation and the fact that the appeal was unsuccessful. The judge has awarded Mr. Eugene Lee, counsel for Respondent Seno, a billing rate of $800 per hour, which is higher than the usual rate awarded by the court. The judge has also reviewed the bill presented by counsel and has found nothing objectionable.
