Decision
 
The motion is GRANTED. Trial is
continued to March 25, 2024, at 9:00 am. Final Status Conference is set for March
14, 2024, at 10:00 am. All counsel are to appear IN PERSON at the Final Status
Conference, with a physical courtesy copy of their completed trial binder. All discovery
deadlines will track the new trial date, as well as the deadlines for motions
in limine and the preparation of trial documents.

and serve it immediately after filing.
 
The court sets an OSC re: dismissal

voluntarily dismisses the remaining does before that date, the hearing will be
taken off-calendar and there will be no need to appear.
 
Discussion
 
Housekeeping
 
            Before
addressing the request for continuance, there are two case management issues that
needs to be corrected.
 
            Plaintiff
sued Defendant Academy, as well as DOES 1-50. Plaintiff then properly substituted
Defendant Archive for DOE 1. But on October 5, 2023, Plaintiff attempted to
substitute a different Defendant for DOE 1.
 
            Only one
party can be substituted for DOE 1. That was Defendant Archive. The attempt to
substitute a new Defendant for DOE 1 is invalid. If Plaintiff wants to substitute
another party into this case by way of Doe Amendment, they must use one of DOES
2-50.
 
            Additionally,
every party who brings a complaint has a time limit of three years from the date
they initially filed their pleading to identify and serve DOE defendants. Code
of Civil Procedure § 583.210(a); Inversiones Papaluchi S.A.S. v.
Superior Court (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 1055, 1061. If a party
fails to meet this deadline, the court is obliged to dismiss those defendants “on
its own motion” and “after notice to the parties.” Code of Civil Procedure
§ 583.210(a).
 
Plaintiff’s initial pleading was
filed on January 15, 2021. Her deadline to identify and serve DOES will pass on
January 15, 2024. Plaintiff needs to name and serve, or else dismiss, the
remaining DOES before that date.
 
Continuance
 
California
Rules of Court Rule 3.1332(a) provides that trial dates are to be treated as
firm. However, Rule 3.1332(c) provides that, although continuances are “disfavored,”
requests should be considered on an individual basis. That subsection also
includes a non-exhaustive list of possible grounds for a continuance.
 
            Plaintiffs base
their motion on Rule 3.1332(c)(6), which provides for a continuance if a party
shows an excused inability to obtain essential evidence despite diligent
efforts. That ground applies here. The depositions of both Plaintiff and another
key witness were postponed due to illness and hospitalization. (Declaration of
Robert B. Reagan ¶ 3). This inability to conduct discovery also prevented
the parties from attending a planned mediation.
 
Conclusion
 
            Because the
parties were unable to complete discovery, the motion for a continuance is
GRANTED. Trial is continued to March 25, 2024, at 9:00 am. Final Status
Conference is set for March 14, 2024, at 10:00 am. All counsel are to appear IN
PERSON at the Final Status Conference. All discovery deadlines will track the
new date, as well as the deadlines for motions in limine and the preparation of
trial documents.
