Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge granting Defendant Nehemia Kong's motion for summary judgment against the claims alleged by Plaintiffs Fermax Inc., Iris A. Lopez, and Leonardo M. Lopez. The Judge found that the Defendant's claims in the underlying lawsuit were legally sufficient and supported by competent evidence, and therefore, there is no triable issue as to the existence of probable cause. Additionally, the Judge found that there is no triable issue as to the existence of malice, as the Defendant's motivation was to bring a legally tenable action, not to harass or harm the Plaintiffs.
