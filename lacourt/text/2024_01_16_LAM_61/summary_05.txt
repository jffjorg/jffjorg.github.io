And here is the English-text summary:

In this tentative ruling, Judge denies Plaintiff Lidia Gomez's motion to obtain a certified copy of the death certificate of Philip Mason Haller. The Plaintiff seeks to use this document to prove that Philip Haller is deceased, which is necessary for her to prosecute her claims against the surviving grandchildren and remaining heirs of Catherine Haller, who owned property that was formerly owned by Philip Haller. However, the Plaintiff fails to explain why a court order is necessary for her to obtain the certified copy, and instead acknowledges that she may still obtain the document without a court order, albeit with a legend stating that it is not a valid document to establish identity. The Judge notes that even without a court order, the certified copy of the death certificate can still be used as evidence of the facts stated therein.
