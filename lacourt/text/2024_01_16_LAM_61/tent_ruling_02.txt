Plaintiffs argue that Defendant’s separate statement does not contain facts
supporting the application of the litigation privilege. (Opposition at p. 8.)
This argument fails, however, since the facts asserted in the separate
statement regarding the underlying litigation go toward all elements of the
litigation privilege: a communication “(1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial
proceedings; (2) by litigants or other participants authorized by law; (3) to
achieve the objects of the litigation; and (4) that have some connection or
logical relation to the action.” (Foothill Federal Credit Union v. Superior
Court (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 632, 635.)
