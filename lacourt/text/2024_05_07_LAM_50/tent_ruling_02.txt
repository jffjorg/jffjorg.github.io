[1]The Court notes
that in Madden v.
Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (1976)
17 Cal.3d 699, 714, the California Supreme Court noted that “Plaintiff contends that a stay
of her action with respect to Kaiser will lead to piecemeal and protracted
litigation because she has also named as defendants the two blood banks. We agree that plaintiff may properly join the
blood banks as parties defendant…but that right does not empower her to avoid
her duty to arbitrate any dispute with Kaiser. We point out that under these
circumstances, the trial court is not required to stay all proceedings
against the defendants who are not entitled to arbitration; the court may, in
its discretion, sever the action as to the blood banks or limit any stay to
those issues subject to arbitration. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
1281.4; Cook v. Superior Court (1966) 240 Cal.App.2d
880, 885 [50 Cal.Rptr. 81].).”
