And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling outlines the Court's consideration of the plaintiff's request to join the blood banks as parties defendant in the ongoing arbitration proceedings. The Court notes that the plaintiff has a right to join the blood banks, but this does not empower her to avoid her duty to arbitrate disputes with the defendant, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals. The Court also emphasizes that the trial court is not required to stay all proceedings against the defendants who are not entitled to arbitration, and instead may sever the action as to the blood banks or limit any stay to those issues subject to arbitration.
