And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motions to compel further responses to interrogatories brought by the plaintiffs, Anthony Mark and Angelino Sebastian Mark, against Circle K Outfitters Inc. The motions were filed in response to the defendant's objection-only responses to the plaintiffs' interrogatories. After a review of the parties' correspondence and the facts of the case, the court has determined that the motions are mooted by subsequent production. The defendant served further responses to the interrogatories on January 12, 2024, which rendered the motions unnecessary. The court has denied the motions as moot. Additionally, the court has declined to grant sanctions in the matter, despite the defendant's failure to produce the promised further discovery responses in a timely manner. The court believes that the parties could have avoided the need for the motions if they had complied with the agreed-upon deadline for serving further responses.
