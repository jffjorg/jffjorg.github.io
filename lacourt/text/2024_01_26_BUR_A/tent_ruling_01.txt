ANALYSIS:  
Bruce
Wasserman (“Judgement Creditor”) brings this motion for an order appointing an
appraiser and granting access to a dwelling of a judgment debtor in this
matter. Judgment Creditor asks the Court for an order appointing an appraiser
so that the property owned by Judgement Debtor Jaqueline Wizgan at 12619
Miranda Street, Valley Village, CA 91607 (the “Property”) may be appraised in
anticipation of Judgment Creditor’s application for a sale of the Property. No
such application is pending before the Court at this time. 
Judgment
Creditor states that the grounds for this motion is Code of Civil Procedure
(“C.C.P.”) § 704.708(d). The Court finds this statute does not support Judgment
Creditor’s motion. 
C.C.P. §
704.708 outlines the procedure for conducting a hearing for the sale of a
dwelling of a judgment debtor. C.C.P. § 704.708(d) specifically allows the
Court to appoint an appraiser to “assist the court” in determining the fair
market value of a home. The statute is located in a section of the Code which
governs the procedure at a hearing for the sale of a judgment debtor’s
dwelling.  It is clear that this statute
is not intended to authorize the Court to appoint an appraiser to assist a
Judgment Creditor in having the property appraised before an application is
even submitted. Rather, the section is intended to allow the Court an
alternative means of assessing the value of property in contrast to those
presented by a Judgment Creditor upon application for sale. Judgment Creditor
is free to retain his own appraiser to determine the fair market value of the
subject property. 
Further,
the statute makes no mention of granting the appraiser access to the property.
There is no statutory authority for such an order, a fact supported by Judgment
Creditor’s failure to cite grounds for this request. 
Accordingly,
the motion is DENIED.
