  - "A decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly.

  - "Discovery sanctions are not to be imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information." (Midwife v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal. App. 3d 57)

And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is regarding a motion for terminating sanctions filed by SC26 III, LLC and Power Property Management, Inc. against Jessica Stein, the plaintiff. The plaintiff brought this action against the defendants alleging habitability issues with an apartment she rented from them. The defendants argue that the plaintiff has willfully failed to comply with discovery requests at multiple junctures, while the plaintiff argues that her failure to comply was due to neglect.

The court notes that the plaintiff has provided discovery responses in the past, but has failed to comply with the court's orders on multiple occasions. The defendants have filed two separate motions to compel discovery responses, which were granted on April 9, 2021 and July 7, 2023. Despite the plaintiff's failures, the court does not find that she has acted willfully and therefore denies the defendants' motion for terminating sanctions.

Instead, the court grants monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,125.00 against the plaintiff to offset the cost of the defendants' actions in attempting to obtain discovery. The court also orders that the sanctions be paid within 30 days.
