And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied a motion filed by Bruce Wasserman, judgment creditor, to appoint an appraiser and grant access to the dwelling of judgment debtor Jaqueline Wizgan. Wasserman argues that the court should appoint an appraiser to assist in determining the fair market value of the property, citing Code of Civil Procedure § 704.708(d). However, the court finds that this statute does not support Wasserman's motion, as it is intended to allow the court to appoint an appraiser to assist in determining the value of property in the context of a sale, not to allow a judgment creditor to have the property appraised before an application is submitted. Additionally, the court finds that there is no statutory authority for granting access to the property. As a result, the motion is denied.
