And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the motion by Private Money Lenders, Inc. to quash service of process. The motion was based on the argument that service was not properly rendered because the registered agent of process, Saleh Hasbun, was not personally served. However, the Judge finds that the proof of service creates a rebuttable presumption that Saleh was indeed personally served and that Private has not offered sufficient evidence to rebut this presumption. The Judge also finds that Plaintiff was in substantial compliance with the service requirements and that Private received actual notice of the action. As a result, the motion to quash service of process is denied.
