And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted defendant Mariane Mufta Bilolo's motion to compel deposition answers from plaintiff Arie Waisbard. The motion was brought after plaintiff's counsel instructed plaintiff not to answer certain questions asked by defendant's counsel at a deposition on August 25, 2023. The questions related to plaintiff's personal life, including his travels, motor vehicle accidents, and medical treatment.

The judge found that plaintiff had not made a sufficient showing that the questions implicate a legally protected privacy interest. The judge held that the burden is on the party asserting a privacy objection to establish the extent and seriousness of the prospective invasion of privacy, and that plaintiff had failed to meet this burden.

The judge also found that the questions were relevant to the instant matter and that the answers were not protected by the right to privacy. The judge concluded that the motion to compel deposition answers was granted and that sanctions were not warranted.
