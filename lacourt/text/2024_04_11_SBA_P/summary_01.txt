The Judge grants Plaintiff's Motion to Compel the Deposition of Defendant's Person Most Qualified. The motion was opposed by the Defendant, who argued that Plaintiff failed to meet and confer in good faith. The Judge disagrees, finding that Plaintiff's counsel did contact the Defendant's counsel to discuss the deposition date and time. The Defendant also objected to the categories of questions to be asked, but the Judge finds that these questions are relevant to the issues in the case, including breach of the express warranty and implied warranty of merchantability. The Defendant is ordered to produce a Person Most Qualified to testify within 30 days.
