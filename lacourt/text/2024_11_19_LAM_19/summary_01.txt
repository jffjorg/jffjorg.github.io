And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to set aside the defaults entered against the defendants. The plaintiff, Pedro Cruz, brought an employment dispute action against the defendants, Roman Marquez and Marquez Supplies and Installation, Inc. d/b/a Marquez Wood Floors, alleging various causes of action including wrongful termination, retaliation, and failure to pay wages. The defendants' defaults were entered on February 15, 2023, and May 17, 2023. The plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the defaults on May 13, 2024, alleging that he needs to file an amended complaint to correct defects with the original complaint.

The judge grants the motion based on the mandatory provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), which requires the court to vacate the default if the application is made within six months of the entry of the default and the party has not intentionally caused the default. The judge also grants the motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 128, subdivision (a)(8), which allows the court to amend and control its process and orders to make them conform to law and justice.

The judge sets a non-appearance case review for March 14, 2025, at 10:00 A.M. in Department 19 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse, and orders the plaintiff to reserve a hearing for the motion and to file the motion papers by February 28, 2025. A failure to do so will result in the court setting an order to show cause re: why this action should not be dismissed for delay of prosecution.
