  CASE NO.:  22STCV18851
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
MOTION TO DISQUALIFY / RECUSE JUDICIAL
  REFERENCE
 
Date: October 16, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
            This action arises out of an
attorney-client relationship.  On June 8,
2022, Plaintiff Dana Urick (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint alleging (1)
negligence (legal malpractice); (2) breach of fiduciary duty; and (3) breach of
contract.
 
            On September 30, 2022, Defendants
Bohm Wildish & Matsen, LLP (“BWM”); James G. Bohm and Cynthia R. Beck (collectively,
“Defendants”) filed a Motion to Compel Judicial Reference (the “Motion to
Compel”), on the ground that the Retainer Agreement executed by Plaintiff and
BWM contains a provision that provides for the resolution of Plaintiff’s claims
by a judicial referee.  The Court granted
the Motion to Compel on November 8, 2022.
 
            Plaintiff reserved a hearing date for
a Motion to Disqualify/Recuse Judicial Reference (the “Motion”), which is
currently set for October 16, 2024. 
Plaintiff, however, failed to properly file the moving documents.
 
            Accordingly, the hearing on the
Motion is CONTINUED to October 28, 2024. 
Plaintiff is ORDERED to properly file the moving document(s) (without
reference to CCP § 170.1), together with a notice of continuance of the hearing,
by the close of business on October 21, 2024.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
 
Dated this 16th day of October 2024
