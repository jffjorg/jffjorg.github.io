[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
MOTIONS TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Date: October 16, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 
 



 
BACKGROUND
            This action was initiated by
Plaintiffs Rokit World, Inc. (“Rokit World”) and Jonathan Kendrick (“Kendrick”)
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) on October 13, 2023.  The operative Second Amended Complaint filed
on June 3, 2024 asserts the following causes of action: (1) breach of implied
contract of confidentiality; and (2) violation of California Financial
Information Privacy Act.
 
            Counsel for Plaintiffs, West Themis
Law, PC (“Counsel”), is seeking to withdraw as counsel for both Defendants, and
has filed two separate motions to be relieved as counsel (collectively, the
“Motions”) on September 18, 2024.  The
Motions are compliant with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  The Motions are unopposed.  Trial is currently set for February 9, 2026. 
DISCUSSION
The court has discretion on whether to allow an
attorney to withdraw, and a motion to withdraw will not be granted where
withdrawal would prejudice the client. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  Withdrawal is
generally permitted unless there is a compelling reason to continue the
representation.  (Heple v. Kluge
(1951) 104 Cal.App.2d 461, 462.)  
 
In connection with the Motions, Counsel declares, as
ground for the Motions, that “[c]onflicts have arisen between counsel and
client that are irreconcilable, unwaivable, and irreparable. The client has
breached its/his contractual obligations pursuant to the retainer agreement.”
 
The
Court finds that the Motions set forth an adequate basis for withdrawal. The
Court, therefore, GRANTS the Motions. The Court notes that while Kendrick can
appear in propria persona, Rokit World must appear by counsel and cannot
defend itself at trial without being represented by counsel. The Court will,
therefore, hold an OSC regarding Rokit World’s representation by counsel on November
13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in this Department. 
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 


 
Parties

department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
