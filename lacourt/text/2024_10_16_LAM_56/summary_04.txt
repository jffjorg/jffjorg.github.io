```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the motion to set aside the judgment and permit the filing of a cross-complaint filed by Respondent Isaac Musighi. The motion is based on allegations of extrinsic fraud by Petitioner Daniel Mossighi, which allegedly rendered the underlying judgment void. However, the Court finds that there is no evidence to support the assertion that the judgment was obtained through fraud, and the motion is untimely under CCP § 473(b) as it was filed more than six years after the entry of the judgment. The Court also finds that the motion is not entitled to relief under CCP § 473(d) as there is no showing of extrinsic fraud. Therefore, the Court denies the motion and does not grant Respondent leave to file a cross-complaint.
