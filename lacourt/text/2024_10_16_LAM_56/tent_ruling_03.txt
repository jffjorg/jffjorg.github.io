MOVING PARTY: Defendant
JUDY NAGY GOETZ (“Defendant”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
AJIM BAKSH (“Plaintiff”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
             On January 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
complaint (“Complaint”) against Defendant, alleging causes of action for 1)
malicious prosecution; and 2) civil harassment. 

 
            On March 5, 2024, Defendant filed a
special motion to strike pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) § 425.16 (“Anti-SLAPP
Motion”).  On May 30, 2024, the Court
denied the Anti-SLAPP Motion as to the first cause of action for malicious
prosecution and granted it as to the second cause of action for civil
harassment.
 
            On July 30, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant Motion for an Award of Attorneys’ Fees pursuant to CCP 425.16 (the
“Motion”).  Plaintiff filed an opposition
on October 3, 2024, and Defendant filed a reply on October 9, 2024.
 
JUDICIAL NOTICE 
            Plaintiff requests judicial notice of pleadings and/or briefs filed by
Defendant in the underlying case filed with the Superior Court of California –
Los Angeles County entitled Nagy Trust Dated May 10, 1988, et al. v. City of
Torrance, LASC Case No. 21SCTP0833 (“CEQA Action”).  The request is GRANTED.  (Evid Code § 452(d).) 
 
DISCUSSION
Legal Standard 
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16(c)(1), “a prevailing defendant on a
special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney’s
fees and costs.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1141-1142.)  Parties may seek attorney fees and costs
in connection with a special motion to strike (1) in the moving papers, (2) in
a subsequently filed motion, or (3) as part of a cost memorandum.  (Melbostad
v. Fisher (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 987, 992.) 
 
A
prevailing party may only recover for work related to the motion, not the
entire suit. (Lafayette Morehouse, Inc. v. Chronicle Publishing Co.
(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1383 (“These reports clearly show the Legislature
intended that a prevailing defendant on a motion to strike be allowed to
recover attorney fees and costs only on the motion to strike, not the entire
suit.  We conclude the trial court erred
when it awarded the Chronicle fees for the entire suit.”); S.B. Beach Properties v. Berti (2006) 39 Cal.4th 374, 381.)  Compensable fees may include fees incurred
establishing the appropriate fee amount.  (569
East County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6
Cal.App.5th 426, 433 (“An award of attorney fees to a prevailing defendant on
an anti-SLAPP motion properly includes attorney fees incurred to litigate the
special motion to strike (the merits fees) plus the fees incurred in connection
with litigating the fee award itself (the fees on fees).”); Ketchum, supra, 24 Cal.4th at 1133 (“an attorney fee award should
ordinarily include compensation for all the hours reasonably spent, including
those relating solely to the fee.”).) 
 
“The
California Supreme Court has upheld the lodestar method for determining the appropriate
amount of attorney fees for a prevailing defendant on an anti-SLAPP motion.
[Citation.]  Under this method, a court
assesses attorney fees by first determining the time spent and the reasonable
hourly compensation of each attorney.  The
court next determines whether that lodestar figure should be adjusted based on
various relevant factors.”  (Mann v.
Quality Old Time Service, Inc. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 328, 342; Frym v. 601 Main Street LLC (2022) 82
Cal.App.5th 613, 620 [“It is well settled that the trial courts are to use the
lodestar method when determining an award of attorney fees under the anti-SLAPP
statute.”].) 
 
“A trial court assessing attorney fees
begins with a touchstone or lodestar figure, based on the ‘careful compilation
of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney . . .
involved in the presentation of the case.”  (Christian
Research Institute v. Alnor (2008)
165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.)  The
Court “need not simply award the sum requested. To the contrary, ascertaining
the fee amount is left to the trial court’s sound discretion.”  (Ibid.)
 “The reasonableness of attorney fees is
within the discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration
of such factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues,
the experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved.  The court may also consider whether the amount
requested is based upon unnecessary or duplicative work.” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)  “The basis for the trial court’s calculation
must be the actual hours counsel has devoted to the case, less those that
result from inefficient or duplicative use of time.”  (Horsford
v. Board Of Trustees Of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 395.)  “The law is clear, however,
that an award of attorney fees may be based on counsel’s declarations, without
production of detailed time records.”  (Raining Data Corp. v. Barrenechea (2009)
175 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1375.)  “[T]he
verified time statements of the attorneys, as officers of the court, are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.”  (Horsford, supra, 132
Cal.App.4th at 396; City of Colton
v. Singletary (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 751, 785.)
 
Here, Defendant seeks to recover attorneys’ fees
associated with work performed on the Anti-SLAPP motion and on the Motion.  The Motion is supported by the declaration of
attorney Patrick K. Bobko as well as the summary in chart format showing the
hours worked by the attorneys and law clerk and their respective hourly rates
(Exh. F), billing records and invoices (Exh. G) and a chart summarizing the
costs incurred related to the Anti-SLAPP Motion (Exh. H).  (Bobko Decl., ¶¶ 14-16; Exhs. F, G and H.)  Defendant seeks a total rounded amount of
$59,100 in attorneys’ fees and costs, broken down as follows:
 
·      
$37,875
representing 50% of the total attorneys’ fees ($75,751) in connection with work
performed on the Anti-SLAPP Motion;
·       $1,224 in costs; and 
·      
$20,000
representing estimated fees in bringing the Motion.
 
In opposition,
Plaintiff mainly argues that the hours expended and hourly rates are
excessive.  The amount of hours and the
hourly rates, however, are well-supported in Defendants’ Motion.  Parties opposing motions for attorneys’ fees
fail to show any abuse of discretion where they merely contend that amounts of
attorney’s fees are excessive without providing an analysis or factual support.
(Maughan
v. Google Technology, Inc. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1250; Avikian v. Wtc Fin. Corp. (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1108, 1119; Premier Medical
Management Systems, Inc. v. California Insurance Guarantee Association (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 560
(emphasizing that opposing parties “submitted no evidence that the hours
claimed by counsel were excessive,” and declining to “declare as a matter of
law that the hours were unreasonable”); Villanueva v. City of Colton (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1188, 1204
(opposing party “offered no evidence of any kind which might have warranted a
reduced fee award.”).
 
Thus, the Court
finds that the hours expended and the asserted hourly rates pertaining to the
Anti-SLAPP Motion are reasonable, and accepts the 50% adjustment of the
asserted total attorney’s fees, taking into account that Defendant was
successful as to only one of the two causes of action in Plaintiff’s Complaint.  The Court, however, exercises its discretion
and reduces the fees pertaining to this Motion to a reasonable amount of
$2,375, representing 5 hours of attorney time at a rate of $475/hour.  
            
RULING
Defendant’s
Motion is GRANTED, in part.  The Court
awards Defendant attorney’s fees in the amount of $40,250.00 ($37,875 plus
$2,375) and costs in the amount of $1,224.
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
