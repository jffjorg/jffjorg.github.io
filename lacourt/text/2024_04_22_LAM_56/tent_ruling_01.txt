MOVING PARTY: Defendant

RESPONDING PARTY: None.
 
            The Court has considered the moving
papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
             On October 14, 2020, Plaintiff David Hokanson
(“Plaintiff”) filed the operative Complaint against Defendant Northrop Grumman
Systems Corporation and DOES 1 through 20, inclusive for: (1) Violation of
Labor Code Section 6310; (2) Violation of Labor Code Section 1102.5; and (3)
Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy. 
            
On August 18, 2021, this Court granted Defendant’s
Motion to Compel Arbitration. 
 
            On February 6, 2024,
Defendant filed the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award. Any
opposition was due on March 8, 2024. As of April 17, 2024, no opposition has
been filed. 
 
DISCUSSION
“Regardless
of the particular relief granted, any arbitrator’s award is enforceable only
when confirmed as a judgment of the superior court.” (O’Hare v.
Municipal Resource Consultants¿(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 267, 278.)  A
party may seek a court judgment confirming an arbitration award by filing and
serving a petition no more than four years, but not less than 10 days,
after the award is served. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.) (Italics
added.) 
 
“Once
a petition to confirm an award is filed, the superior court must select one of
only four courses of action: it may confirm the award, correct and confirm it,
vacate it, or dismiss the petition.”  (EHM Productions, Inc. v.
Starline Tours of Hollywood, Inc.¿(2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.) 
“It is well settled that the scope of judicial review of arbitration awards is
extremely narrow.”  (California Faculty Assn. v. Superior Court¿(1998)
63 Cal.App.4th 935, 943.)  “Neither the trial court, nor the appellate
court, may ‘review the merits of the dispute, the sufficiency of the evidence,
or the arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we correct or review an award because of
an arbitrator’s legal or factual error, even if it appears on the award’s
face.”  (EHM Productions, supra, at p. 1063-64.) 
 
Service of the
Petition, and Notice of Hearing 
Pursuant
to the Code of Civil Procedure Section 1290.4, subdivision (a), “A copy of the
petition and a written notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof and
any other papers upon which the petition is based shall be served in the manner
provided in the arbitration agreement for the service of such petition and notice.”
(Code Civ. Proc., §1290.4, subd. (a).)  
 
But
“if the arbitration agreement does not provide the manner in which such service
shall be made and the person upon whom service is to be made has not previously
appeared in the proceeding and has not previously been served in accordance
with this subdivision…Service within this State shall be made in the manner
provided by law for the service of summons in an action.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1290.4(b)(1).) 
 
Here,
Defendant filed proof of service reflecting this Petition and Notice of March
21, 2024 Ruling Continuing Hearing on the Petition was served on Plaintiff on
April 4, 2024. Therefore, Plaintiff had notice of this Petition and
hearing.  As such, the Petition complies
with the service requirements. 
 
Service of the
Arbitration Award 
Pursuant
to the Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6, “The neutral arbitrator shall
serve a signed copy of the award on each party to the arbitration
personally or by registered or certified mail or as provided in the
agreement.”¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 1283.6.) 
 
Here,
the Petition states that the arbitration hearing was conducted on February 27
and February 28, 2023. (Cripps Decl., ¶ 8.) Furthermore, the Petition indicates
the Final Award by the Arbitrator was issued on July 14, 2023. (Id. ¶ 10,
Ex. C.) Moreover, Defendant attached the email from the American Arbitration
Association reflecting the Final Award of the Arbitrator signed by the
Arbitrator was served on each party in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure
Section 1283.6. There is no indication that electronic service was not  agreed upon by the parties. Therefore, the
service of the arbitration award complies with the service requirements.  
 
Filing
Requirements 
The
Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4 states in pertinent part…a petition
under this chapter shall: 

Set forth the substance of or have
     attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies
     the existence of such an agreement. 


Set forth the names of the
     arbitrators. 


Set forth or have attached a copy of
     the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any. 

(Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1285.4) 
 
Here,
the Petition sets forth the substance of the agreement to arbitrate. (Petition
¶¶ 2-3.) Moreover, the Petition states that Michael R. Diliberto was the
arbitrator for this matter. (Id. at ¶ 1.) Additionally, a copy of the
arbitration award and written opinion of Michael R. Diliberto is attached to
the declaration in support of this instant Petition. . (Cripps Decl., ¶ 10, Ex.
C.) Lastly, since the Petition is unopposed, Plaintiff has not established any
ground for vacating the arbitration award. As such, the Petition is in
compliance with the filing requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section
1285.4.   
 
Therefore,
Defendant Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation’s Petition to Confirm
Arbitration Award is GRANTED.  
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
