And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers in a dispute between Hyundai Motor Company and the Canico Siblings, who reside in Mexico. Hyundai seeks an undertaking from the Canico Siblings to ensure they will not default on a judgment. The Court finds that the Canico Siblings are indigent and unable to pay for an undertaking, and therefore waives the requirement of a bond on the ground of indigency. The Court denies the motion for an undertaking.
