California
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Isiah Dryer
            The
Court has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
             Plaintiff Isiah Dryer (“Plaintiff”) is a
disabled African American former employee of Defendant Regents of the
University of California (“UC” or “Defendant”). He filed a complaint on May 1,
2023, alleging multiple causes of action against Defendant. The operative
Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) alleges seven causes of action under the Fair
Employment and Housing Act (“FEHA”): (1) Discrimination; (2) Failure to Prevent
Discrimination; (3) Failure to Engage in a Timely Good Faith Interactive
Process; (4) Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodation; (5) Retaliation; (6)
Harassment; and (7) Failure to Prevent Harassment. 
Defendant
served Form Interrogatories, Set One, on Plaintiff on October 10, 2023. (Newell
Decl., ¶ 3; Exhibit A.)  Defendant received Plaintiff’s responses on November
14, 2023. (Newell Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. B).  Plaintiff responded with “boilerplate”
objections and no verified responses. 
However, Plaintiff’s counsel stated they would be
supplementing with substantive responses. (Newell Decl., ¶ 7.)  In response, Defense counsel granted a
two-week extension to Plaintiff to provide substantive responses.  (Id.)  On November 28, 2023, Plaintiff requested
additional time to supplement their responses until December 12, 2023.  (Newell Decl., ¶ 8.)  Defense counsel immediately granted the
request.  (Id.)   For the
next few months, Plaintiff continued to request extensions to provide
supplemental responses by December 18, 2023, January 5, 2024, January 12, 2024,
January 19, 2024, February 16, 2024, and finally March 4, 2024.  (Newell Decl. ¶ 9, Exhibit C).  After eight extension requests, and nearly
five months since the requests were first served upon Plaintiff, Plaintiff has not
provided any substantive responses to the Form Interrogatories.  (Newell Decl. ¶ 12.)
 
On
March 4, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to compel Plaintiff’s further
responses to Defendant’s Form Interrogatories, Set One, and request for sanctions
against Plaintiff.  
 
On
April 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed a one-page opposition, asserting only one
argument, that Defendant failed to request an Informal Discovery Conference
(“IDC”) before filing this motion, against Department 56 rules.   Plaintiff is hereby informed that with the sunsetting
of the requirements for an IDC in CCP Section 2016.080, there is no longer a
statutory basis for Courts to impose the requirement of an IDC before a motion
to compel.
 
On
April 15, 2024, Defendant replied.
 
MEET
AND CONFER 
The
meet and confer requirement has been met. 
 
DISCUSSION 
Under
California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 2017.010 “any person may
obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action or to the determination of any
motion made in that action, if the matter either is itself admissible in
evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.”  “Discovery may
relate to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery.”  (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.)  “The Court shall
limit the scope of discovery if it determines that the burden, expense, or
intrusiveness of that discovery clearly outweighs the likelihood that the
information sought will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Lipton
v. Superior Court (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1611.)  “For discovery
purposes, information is relevant if it might reasonably assist a party in
evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement.”  (Id.)
 Discovery statutes are “construed
liberally in favor of disclosure.” (Obregon v. Superior Court (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 424, 434.)  Where a party objects to a motion to compel, the
burden is on the responding party to justify any objection.  (Fairmont
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)  To support an
objection to a request for production of documents, the objecting party has to
establish the validity of its objections with supporting facts in order to meet
its burden.  (Southern Pac. Co. v. Superior Court (1969) 3
Cal.App.3d 195, 198.)   
 
 Issue
No.1: Good Cause 
A
motion to compel further responses to the production of documents must “set
forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
demand.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(b)(1).)  “Code Civ. Proc., §
2031 . . . which applies to document production requests served on a party,
requires a party seeking to compel such production to set forth the specific
facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection
demand.”  (Calcor Space Facility, Inc.
v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 223-224, emphasis
added.)  “In law and motion practice, factual evidence is supplied to the
court by way of declarations.”  (Id. at 224.) 
 
The
Court finds that Defendant has met the good cause requirement to justify Plaintiff’s
further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One.  Form Interrogatories
are prepared by the Judicial Council, and by their very nature are reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  
Based
on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s
further responses to Defendant’s first set of form interrogatories and orders
that complete, verified responses without further objections are to be served
by Plaintiff on Defendant within twenty days of the date of this order. 
 
 


 
Issue
No. 2: Monetary Sanctions 
Defendant
asserts that monetary sanctions should be imposed against Plaintiff for failure
to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery under CCP §
2023.010. Defendant requests monetary sanctions of $1,208.00 against
Plaintiff.  The Court finds that the sanctions requested are reasonable
and therefore GRANTS Defendant’s request for monetary sanctions in the amount
of $1,208.00 against Plaintiff.  
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
