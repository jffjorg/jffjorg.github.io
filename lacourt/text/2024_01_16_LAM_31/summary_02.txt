And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to transfer the case to a different venue. The defendants argue that the motion is timely and that the plaintiff misinterprets the statutory basis for the motion. The judge agrees with the defendants, finding that the motion is timely because it was brought under CCP section 397, which allows for permissive transfers. The judge also notes that the plaintiff misconstrues the holding in Ford Motor Credit v. Superior Court, which held that venue is mandatory in Sacramento County for FEHA actions. The judge concludes that the defendants' motion is timely and will be granted.
