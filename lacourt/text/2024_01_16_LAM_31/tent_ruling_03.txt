MOTION
FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES AND COSTS



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Patricia Ramirez
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant General
Motors, LLC
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
On February 10, 2022, Plaintiff, Patricia Ramirez, filed this
action against Defendant, General Motors, LLC, for violations of the
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, Civil Code § 1790, et seq. Defendant filed
an Answer to the Complaint on March 14, 2022.  
 
On June 16, 2023, Defendant served an Offer to Compromise
and Acceptance Under Code of Civil Procedure section 998.  Plaintiff accepted
the 998 Offer on June 27, 2023. 
 
On September 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed this Motion for
Attorney’s Fees and Costs and a Memorandum of Costs. 
 
Defendant filed an opposition.  Plaintiff replied. 
 
II.        DISCUSSION 
            Evidentiary
Objections
            Plaintiff
submits twenty-five (25) objections to the Declaration of Yohannes Moore.  As the objections are not material to the
disposition of this motion, the Court declines to rule on Plaintiff’s objections.
             Attorney’s Fees
            Plaintiff
seeks a total award of $59,668.00 in attorney’s fees.  
            On June 27,
2023, the parties agreed to settle the matter. 
(Barry Decl., Ex. 3.)  The settlement provides for attorney’s fees and
costs by motion under Civil Code section 1794. 
(Id. at ¶ 3.)
Civil Code section 1794, subdivision (d) provides:
(d) If the
buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by
the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate
amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time
expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by
the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.


(Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d), emphasis added.)
 
            The
parties do not dispute that Plaintiff is the prevailing party under the
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. 
Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney
fees and costs as the prevailing party. 
The only matter at issue is the reasonableness of the fees and costs
requested.
 
            Attorney
Fees 
 
The determination of reasonable amount of attorney fees is
within the sound discretion of trial courts.  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22
Cal.4th 1084, 1095; Akins v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000) 79
Cal.App.4th 1127, 1134.) “The determination of what constitutes a reasonable
fee generally ‘begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate….’”  “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for
comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court
based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty
of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”  (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc.
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)  In
setting the hourly rate for an attorney fees award, courts are entitled to
consider the rate of “‘fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in
the community for similar work.’”  (Bihun
v. AT&T Information Systems, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 976, 997
[affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin v.
Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 664.)  The burden is on the party seeking attorney
fees to prove reasonableness of the fees. 
(Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino
(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 615.)
 
The Court has broad discretion in determining the amount of
a reasonable attorney’s fee award which will not be overturned absent a
“manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or necessary
findings not supported by substantial evidence.”  (Bernardi v. County of Monterey
(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-94.) 
The Court need not explain its calculation of the amount of attorney’s
fees awarded in detail; identifying the factors considered in arriving at the
amount will suffice.  (Ventura v. ABM
Industries Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-75.)
            Number
of Hours Reasonably Expended
“[I]t is the burden of the challenging party to
point to the specific items challenged [within the moving party’s verified
billing invoice], with a sufficient argument and citations to evidence.  General arguments that fees claimed are
excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.”  (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 488.)  
 
As a threshold matter, Defendant does not
challenge the reasonableness of Plaintiff’s counsels’ hourly billing rates.  The Court therefore finds their billing rates
to be reasonable.[1]  Rather, Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s
counsel spent excessive time on tasks which Defendant asserts were routine
filings and template discovery, and for duplicative work.  (Opp., pp. 7-8.)  Defendant challenges specific billing
entries.  (Opp., pp. 7-10.)  
 
The
Court appreciates this case progressed towards trial.  Along the way, Plaintiff served and responded
to standard written discovery, filed a motion to compel and two motions to
compel further (which were resolved after an IDC), participated in mediation,
and prepared motions in limine for trial.  (Mot., pp. 7-11.)  There has been little law and motion practice.
 
Moreover, there was nothing particularly complex
or unique about this case.  The issues
involved were applicable to other consumers’ vehicles, thereby triggering
economies of scale in terms of Plaintiff’s counsel’s efficiency in litigating
this type of lemon law case.  Lead
attorney David Barry is highly experienced in Song-Beverly litigation. (See Barry
Decl., ¶ 27.) Litigating this matter should not have required anything more
than slight factual modification to existing boilerplate.  
 
The Court in its discretion declines to apply
a multiplier given this was a relatively standard Song-Beverly case with no
novel or complex issues of law.  
Considering these facts, the Court agrees that
in some instances, the time quoted is excessive or unreasonable under the
circumstances.  Attached to the Declaration
of David Barry,  as exhibit 4, is a chronological
running time sheet of the work performed on the case from December 10, 2021
through January 4, 2024.  The time sheet
spans forty-one pages.  The moving papers
exceed two hundred pages.  No effort was
made to categorize the time entries by group.  Certain entries demonstrate the why time
entries were excessive.  Here are some examples:  “Anticipatory time for preparation for,
attendance at and drafting memo to file re case status for Cont. Order to show
cause re: Dismissal hearing:  1.5 hours. (entry
dated 1/4/24, page 45); prepare for and attend and appear for hearing on
Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s Fees and Costs: 1 hour (entry dated 11/21-22/23,
page 44-45) and travel to and from the hearing for 1 hour each way.  But the hearing did not take place on
11/22/24.  The hearing was continued by
the Court on 11/1/23 to 1/16/24;       
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that
the total amount of reasonable attorney’s fees in this case is $48,612.  This was calculated by reducing Plaintiff’s
counsels’ billing entries as follows: 
 
·        
4 hours
billed for Drafting Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission, Requests for Production
of Documents, Form Interrogatories, and Deposition Notices to GM on March 31,
April 3 and 4, 2022:  These were templated
requests.  The Court finds the time
billed to be excessive.  The Court
reduces these entries by 2 hours at Mr. Matera’s hourly rate, amounting to a
reduction of $700.
·        
4.5
hours billed for Reviewing GM’s Discovery Responses and Objections to
Deposition Notice on May 18 and 19, 2022: 
The Court finds the time to be excessive.  The Court reduces these entries by 2.0
hours at Mr. Matera’s hourly rate, amounting to a reduction of $875.
·        
1.5 hours billed for
Drafting Meet and Confer Correspondence on June 10, 2022: The Court finds the
time to be excessive.  The Court
reduces this entry by 1 hour at Mr. Matera’s hourly rate, amounting to a
reduction of $350.
·        
13.5 hours billed for
Drafting Two Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses on July 18 and 19,
2022, August 31, 2022, September 8 and 13, 2022, and December 7, 2022:  Many of the issues were resolved at an IDC and
had Plaintiff availed itself of the IDC sooner the templated motions would not
have been necessary.  The time is
excessive.  The Court reduces these
entries by 5.5 hours at Mr. Matera’s hourly rate, amounting to a reduction of $1,925.
·        
2.9 hours billed for
Preparing, Traveling to, and Attending the Hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Request for Production on June 8 and 9, 2023:  The Court reduces the entirety of these
entries, amounting to a reduction of $870.
·        
2.6 hours billed for
Drafting a Motion to Compel Expert Deposition on May 8, 10, and 16, 2023:  Preparation of the motion was likely not
necessary because it concerned timing not production.  The Court reduces these entries by 1.6
hours at Ms. Rabieian’s hourly rate, amounting to a reduction of $696.
·        
1.9 hours billed for
Drafting Motion to Compel Further Supplemental Special Interrogatory Responses
on May 29, 2023: The Court reduces this entry by 0.9 hours at Ms.
Rabieian’s hourly rate, amounting to a reduction of $391.50.
·        
6.5 hours billed for
Drafting Motions in Limine on June 8, 9, and 12, 2023:  These are templated motions.  The Court reduces these entries by 3.5
hours at Ms. Rabieian’s hourly rate, amounting to a reduction of $1,522.50.
·        
13.3 hours billed for
Attorneys’ Fee Demand on July 7. 10, TBD, and 12/4-5, 2023.  Six time keepers to prepare this matter is
excessive.  Moreover, time was billed for
events that did not occur.  The
Court reduces the entries by half for a reduction of $3,726.5.   
·        
Total amount reduced:
$11,056.
            Costs
Plaintiff
seeks an award of $2,975.33 in costs.  
 
The memorandum of cost is a verified statement by the
party, attorney, or agent that the costs are correct and were necessarily
incurred in the case.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700 (a)(1).) 
“If the items appear to be proper charges, the verified memorandum is prima
facie evidence that the costs, expenses and services therein listed were
necessarily incurred by the defendant, and the burden of showing that an item
is not properly chargeable or is unreasonable is upon the [objecting
party].”  (Oak Grove School Dist. v. City Title Ins. Co. (1963) 217
Cal.App.2d 678, 698.)  “[I]f the correctness of the memorandum is
challenged either in whole or in part by the affidavit or other evidence of the
contesting party, the burden is then on the party claiming the costs and
disbursements to show that the items charged were for matters necessarily
relevant and material to the issues involved in the action.”  (Id.
at p. 699.)¿¿ 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 lists the costs that
are recoverable.  Section 1033.5 provides: “(1) Costs are allowable if
incurred, whether or not paid. (2) Allowable costs shall be reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or
beneficial to its preparation. (3) Allowable costs shall be reasonable in
amount. (4) Items not mentioned in this section ... may be allowed ... in the
court’s discretion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §¿1033.5, subd. (c)(4).)¿¿ 
            Defendant
requests that the Court remove the jury fees ($150), court reporter fees for
the hearing on this motion ($550), filing fees for four motions to compel ($240),
and mileage and parking fees to attend hearings ($89.38).  Defendant argues each of the following fees
should not be awarded because: (1) the case settled prior to trial; (2) the
court reporter fees have not been actually incurred; (3) the motions to compel
were never heard; and (4) mileage and parking fees are business expenses, not
allowable costs.  
            The Court
declines to tax the jury fees, court reporter fees, and filing fees for the
motions to compel.  First, jury fees are allowable
costs.  (Civ. Proc. Code, § 1033.5, subd.
(a)(1).)  Second, courter reporter fees
are also allowable costs.  (Civ. Proc.
Code, § 1033.5, subd. (a)(11).)  Defendant
does not show that the court reporter fees were not incurred.  (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700(a)(1)
[“The memorandum of cost is a verified statement by the party, attorney, or
agent that the costs are correct and were necessarily incurred in the case.”].) 
Third, the Court is not persuaded by Defendant’s argument that the filing fees for
the motions to compel were unreasonable simply because the motions were never
heard by the Court.  That the motions
were never heard does not establish whether the filing of the motions were
unnecessary.  Further, filing fees for
motions are allowable costs.  (Civ. Proc.
Code, § 1033.5, subd. (a)(1).)  
            However,
with respect to the mileage and parking fees, the Court agrees that mileage and
parking fees are not allowable costs.  Section
1033.5 provides that travel expenses to attend depositions are
allowable costs.  (Civ. Proc. Code, §
1033.5, subd. (a)(3)(C), emphasis added.) 
Section 1033.5 does not include travel expenses to attend hearings.  Accordingly, the Court reduces the requested
costs by $89.38.
III.       CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff
is awarded attorney’s fees in the total sum of $48,612 and costs in the sum of
$2,885.95 for a total award of $51,497.95.
