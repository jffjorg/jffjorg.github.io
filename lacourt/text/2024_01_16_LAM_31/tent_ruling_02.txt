[1]  Plaintiff
argues Defendants’ motion is untimely.  Plaintiff
misconstrues the statutory basis for Defendants’ motion.  Defendants bring this motion pursuant to CCP section
397, not CCP section 396b.  A motion to
transfer under section 397 is permissive; there is no specific time limit by
which the motion must be brought. 
Defendants’ motion is timely.


[2] In Malloy, the Appellate
Court distinguished Ford as follows: 
“In Ford Motor Credit v. Superior Court, supra, 50
Cal.App.4th 306, 57 Cal.Rptr.2d 682 our colleagues in Division Five of this
court held venue for plaintiffs’ FEHA action was mandatory in Sacramento
County, where plaintiffs had been employed and where they alleged all the acts
of racial discrimination, harassment and retaliation took place, not in Los
Angeles County, “where they now reside.” (Id. at p.
308, 57 Cal.Rptr.2d 682.) The case did not involve any issue of remote or
off-site work.” (Malloy, supra, 83 Cal.App.5th at. 550, fn. 8.)  In a similar fashion, Ford did not
involve a remote job application where the plaintiff affirmatively states s/he would
have worked in the venue location but for the alleged unlawful practice.  
 


[3] While the statute may be subject to the abuse as described
by Defendants, that is a topic better raised with the Legislature than the
superior court.
