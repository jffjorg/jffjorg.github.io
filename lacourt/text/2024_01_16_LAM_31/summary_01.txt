Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to transfer venue from Los Angeles County to Tulare County. The plaintiff, Pedro Gutierrez, has filed an employment discrimination and wrongful termination action against Walmart, Inc. et al. The defendants have moved to transfer the venue to Tulare County, arguing that this is a more convenient location for the witnesses and the interests of justice.

The judge has ruled that venue is proper in Los Angeles County, as the plaintiff would have worked in this location but for the alleged unlawful conduct. The judge has also denied the motion to transfer venue to Tulare County, finding that the defendants have failed to meet their burden to demonstrate that the interests of justice weigh in favor of a last-minute transfer.

The judge has also found that the defendants failed to present any information about witnesses in this case, and that the only discussion presented by the defendants has to do with the convenience of the parties in the case, which is not an appropriate consideration for the court. The judge has also ruled that the defendants' argument that they brought the motion as soon as they learned that the plaintiff could not recall the specifics of his job application lacks traction.

Overall, the judge has denied the motion to transfer venue, finding that the interests of justice do not support a last-minute transfer to Tulare County.
