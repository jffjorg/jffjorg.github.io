I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            On May 13, 2022, Plaintiff, Jazzmin C. Myers-Predium, filed a
complaint against Defendants, Los Angeles Police Department (“LAPD”) and LAPD
Officer Jaime Morales (“Morales”).  On November
30, 2022, Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (SAC).  Plaintiff is self-represented.  
 
            The SAC
alleges that Plaintiff posted a poem to her private Facebook page, and the next
morning, on December 14, 2021, police officers came to her house to conduct a
welfare check. (SAC, p. 10.)  The
officers took her to be evaluated.  Plaintiff
sues the LAPD and Officer Morales “for wrongful detainment, invasion of
privacy, anxiety, traumatize, discrimination, challenging one’s integrity,
harassment, and coercing and questioning of minor under the age of 18 without
parental presentation, violation of the 1st and 4th Amendment of the U.S.
constitution.”  (SAC, p. 11.)  The SAC pleads compliance with the Government
Tort Claims Act.
 
            On March 17,
2023, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Leave to File Late Claim.  On November 1, 2023, the Court denied
Plaintiff’s motion and dismissed her state law claims.  The Court further stated: “To the extent
Plaintiff is seeking to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. section 1983 or federal
claims, she is not required to comply with the late claim application
requirements and is not barred by the Claims Act from proceeding with her
lawsuit, as it does not apply to federal claims. (Williams v. Horvath (1976) 16
Cal.3d 834, 836.)”  (11/1/23 Minute Order.)
 
            On November
27, 2023, Defendant Morales filed this Demurrer to the SAC, arguing that the SAC
is uncertain.
 
            No
opposition has been filed.[1]
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARD FOR DEMURRER
 
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleadings and
will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on its face.¿ (City
of Atascadero v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 445, 459.)¿ “We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or
law.¿ We accept the factual allegations of the complaint as true and also
consider matters which may be judicially noticed.¿ [Citation.]”¿ (Mitchell
v. California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del
E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604
[“the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however improbable
they may be”].) Allegations are to be liberally construed.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
452.)¿ In construing the allegations, the court is to give effect to specific
factual allegations that may modify or limit inconsistent general or conclusory
allegations.¿ (Financial Corporation of America v. Wilburn (1987) 189
Cal.App.3d 764, 769.)¿¿  
 
A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e).)¿“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint
is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under
modern discovery procedures.”¿ (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)¿¿¿ 
 
Where the complaint contains substantial factual
allegations sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to
meet, a demurrer for uncertainty will be overruled or plaintiff will be given
leave to amend.¿ (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185
Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)¿ Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a
reasonable possibility of successful amendment.¿ (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to show the Court
that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)¿¿ 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Meet and
Confer 
 
            Defense
counsel has satisfied the meet and confer requirement.  (Declaration of Rebekah
Young, ¶ 3.) 
            
            Analysis
 
            Morales argues the SAC is uncertain.  The Court agrees.  Although consisting of more than eleven,
single-spaced pages, the SAC does not clearly state a cause of action.  The lack of clarity in the allegations does
not apprise Morales of the nature of the claims.  
            
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
            Accordingly,
the Demurrer is SUSTAINED.  Leave to
amend is GRANTED.  
 
            Plaintiff
is ordered to serve and file her Third Amended Complaint within 30 days of this
order.
 
            Defendant
is to serve and file her responsive pleading within 30 days of service of the
amended pleading.
 
Plaintiff is encouraged to utilize the lawyer referral
services available on the State Bar’s website (https://www.calbar.ca.gov) and
the Self-Help page on the Superior Court’s website (https://www.lacourt.org).¿¿
 
Demurring party to give notice, unless waived.
