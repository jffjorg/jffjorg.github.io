This is a tentative ruling by Judge Kerry Bensinger in the case of Patricia Ramirez v. General Motors, LLC (Case Number: 22STCV05122). The case involves a dispute over attorney's fees and costs awarded to Plaintiff as the prevailing party in a lawsuit over violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.

The Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney's fees and costs, but reduces the amount of the award due to excessive time spent on certain tasks and activities. The Court awards Plaintiff attorney's fees in the total sum of $48,612 and costs in the sum of $2,885.95 for a total award of $51,497.95.

The parties disputed the reasonableness of the attorney's fees and costs requested by Plaintiff, with Defendant arguing that the amount was excessive and not justified by the work performed. The Court considered the parties' arguments and evidence, including the verified memorandum of costs and the declarations of counsel, in making its decision.

The Court also considered the applicable laws and statutes, including the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, Civil Code section 1794, subdivision (d), and Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5.
