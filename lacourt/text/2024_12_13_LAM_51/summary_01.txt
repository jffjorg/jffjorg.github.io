Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication, dismissing the defendant's Ninth and Tenth Affirmative Defenses. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., sold a vehicle with express and limited warranties, which contained defects and nonconformities that were not sufficiently fixed during the warranty period. The defendant argues that it maintains a qualified third-party dispute resolution program, which would shield it from civil penalties. However, the judge finds that the defendant's program is not certified by the Department of Consumer Affairs, and therefore, the defendant's affirmative defenses fail. The judge also finds that the defendant has not met its burden to show that a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether its program is certified or whether its actions were willful. As a result, the judge grants the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication, dismissing the defendant's affirmative defenses.
