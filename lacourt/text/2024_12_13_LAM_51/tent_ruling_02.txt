While the Court predominantly addressed standing, the explanation about the ACP
is pertinent to the instant dispute.

AHM’s other argument that there are triable facts as to whether they
substantially complied with Civ. Code § 1793.22(d) because they have every
requirement except certification by the ACP is not persuasive. First, it would
provide protection for “qualified” third-party dispute resolution programs
whether or not the ACP reviews their application. Second, the statutes clearly
state that the ACP determines whether the applicant substantially complied with
Civ. Code § 1793.22(d), not the court. The court has found no authority where
the court determines whether a third-party dispute resolution program is
qualified. Finally, there are no disputed facts. Rather, it is a dispute in law
which the court is equipped to handle.
