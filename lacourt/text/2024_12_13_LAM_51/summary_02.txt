And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court's tentative ruling addresses the standing of AHM in a dispute resolution program application. AHM argues that there are triable facts as to whether they substantially complied with California Civil Code section 1793.22(d) because they have every requirement except certification by the Alternative Dispute Resolution Program (ACP). However, the court finds this argument unpersuasive. The court notes that the statutes clearly state that the ACP determines whether the applicant substantially complied with the code, not the court. Additionally, the court has found no authority where the court determines whether a third-party dispute resolution program is qualified. The court concludes that there are no disputed facts, only a dispute in law, which it is equipped to handle.
