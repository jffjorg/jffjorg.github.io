Here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is about a motion for leave to file a first amended complaint (FAC) by Plaintiffs Lowell Barber and Sharon Goodlow against Defendants Los Angeles World Airports, City of Los Angeles, and others. The Plaintiffs seek to add a newly discovered plaintiff and factual allegations to their complaint. The City opposes the motion, arguing that the Plaintiffs' third cause of action for vicarious liability is insufficient. The Court grants the motion, ordering the Plaintiffs to file the FAC within 10 days as a stand-alone pleading, and to discuss scheduling at the hearing. The Court notes that the City's opposition does not appear to be an opposition to the motion, but rather raises issues that would typically be addressed in a demurrer or motion to strike.
