And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiffs Lowell Barber and Sharon Goodlow. The Plaintiffs seek to add a newly discovered party, Four Seasons, LLC, and factual allegations to their complaint against defendants Los Angeles World Airports, et al. The City of Los Angeles opposes the motion, arguing that the proposed amended complaint fails to state a cause of action. The Judge grants the motion, orders the plaintiff to file the FAC within 10 days, and anticipates a demurrer shortly thereafter. The Judge also notes that the City's opposition does not appear to be an opposition to the motion to file a FAC, but rather raises points that would typically be addressed in a demurrer or motion to strike.
