And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants, Enterprise Leasing Company-West, LLC and EAN Holdings, LLC. The plaintiffs, Trinidad Garcia, Patricia Garcia, Trinidad Garcia Jr., Jesus Garcis, Velia Garcia Esparza, Modesta Garcia Esparza, Eliue Garcia, and Erbey Garcia, filed a survival action and wrongful death action against the defendants after a motor vehicle accident in which decedent Patricia Esparza was killed.

The defendants argue that the Graves Amendment preempts liability because they were engaged in the trade or business of renting or leasing motor vehicles at the time of the accident and there was no negligence or criminal wrongdoing on their part. The plaintiffs argue that the defendants are liable under California Vehicle Code section 17150, which imposes liability on the owner of a motor vehicle for death or injury caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of the driver.

The Court finds that the defendants have met their burden of establishing that the Graves Amendment preempts liability and grants summary judgment in favor of the defendants. The Court also declines to rule on the plaintiffs' objections and finds that the defendants are not liable for the accident. The case will be dismissed, and the defendants will be awarded summary judgment.
