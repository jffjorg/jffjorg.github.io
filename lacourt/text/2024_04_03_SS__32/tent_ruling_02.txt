Plaintiffs argue that liability is pursuant to California law, but the
statutory limit is pursuant to Nevada law. (Opposition at p. 8.) Although
neither party cites authority for which stateâ€™s statutory limit should apply,
the Court finds that this issue is not dispositive. Both parties agree that the
liability alleged is pursuant to California law. As explained by the Eleventh
Circuit, the statutory caps or limits do not bring the liability provision
within the savings clause of the Graves Amendment. In
opposition, the only Nevada statute that Plaintiffs cite is Nevada
Revised Statutes section 485.185, which imposes an insurance requirement with
minimum policy values.

to enforce the settlement has merely been reserved.
