own, inhabit and/or operate the property located at 3015 Durfee Avenue,

the warrant, the Police observed that the subject property had been
converted into a marijuana cultivation facility.
The Police seized numerous items which had been used to cultivate,

Violation of MAUCRSA (Business & Professions Code
§§ 26000 et seq.)
On March 30, 2022, Lizarraga, A. Paterno and R. Paterno filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint
(“FACC”), asserting causes of action against Gerardo Aviles (“Aviles”), Flores,

A Case Management Conference is set for June 11, 2024.
Discussion
Baute Crochetiere
Hartley & McCoy LLP (“Firm”) seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for
Lizarraga, A. Paterno and R. Paterno (“Clients”).
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See
Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.)
California
Rules of Court (“CRC”) Rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice of motion and motion
directed to the client (made on the Notice
of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure § 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under section
284(1) (made on the Declaration in
Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form
(MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and
the proposed order on the client and on all other parties who have appeared in
the case; and (4) a proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). The court may delay the effective
date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the
signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
Attorney Artyom Baghidshyan (“Bagdishyan”) represents that “[t]he joint
representation relationship of the jointly Represented Parties has broken down,
and continued representation of any and/or all of the Represented Parties
engenders a conflict of interest in violation of California Rules of
Professional Conduct Rule 3/310.”
Baghidshyan states that he has served the Clients by mail at the Clients’
last known address(es) with copies of the motion papers served with this
declaration and that he has confirmed, within the past 30 days, that the
address is current, by telephone.
The court
determines that the requirements of Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 enumerated above have been
sufficiently met.
Accordingly, the
motion is granted, effective upon the filing of a proof
of service showing service of the signed order upon
the Clients at the Clients’ last known address(es).
