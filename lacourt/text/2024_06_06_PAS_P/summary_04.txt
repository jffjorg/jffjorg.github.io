And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication of the defendant's three affirmative defenses. The defendant, Dolores Marie Carrey, admitted in discovery that she had no facts or witnesses to support her affirmative defenses. The plaintiff, Craig Renwick, provides evidence that Carrey's discovery responses are factually devoid and do not exclude the possibility that Renwick may possess or reasonably obtain evidence to support his claims. The court finds that Carrey has not provided sufficient evidence to support her affirmative defenses and grants the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication.
