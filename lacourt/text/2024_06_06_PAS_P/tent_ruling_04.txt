 Case Number:  23AHCV0179    Hearing Date:   June 6, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATIONI.        INTRODUCTION
          This is a personal injury
case arising from a car accident. Plaintiff Craig Renwick alleges that
Defendant Dolores Marie Carrey hit him with her car as he was crossing the
street on November 6, 2022.  
The
complaint contains two causes of action: (1) motor vehicle negligence and (2)
negligence. 
Plaintiff
Renwick filed the instant motion for summary adjudication on March 1, 2024. He
seeks summary adjudication of Defendant’s three affirmative defenses. Defendant
filed an opposition on May 23, 2024. Renwick submitted a reply on May 30, 2024.
The
motion is GRANTED. 
II.      LEGAL
STANDARD
          Summary adjudication may be granted
where it completely disposes of a cause of action, an affirmative defense, a claim
of damages, or an issue of duty. (CCP § 437c(f).) A
Plaintiff moving for summary adjudication of an affirmative defense has the
initial burden to make a prima facie showing that that the affirmative defense
is without merit.  (Continental Ins.
Co. v. Columbus Line, Inc. (2003) 107 Cal. App. 4th 1190, 1199-1200;  See's Candy Shops, Inc. v. Sup. Ct.
(2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 889, 900  [“The
plaintiff bears the initial burden to show there is no triable issue of
material fact as to the defense and that he or she is entitled to judgment on
the defense as a matter of law. In so doing, the plaintiff must negate an
essential element of the defense or establish the defendant does not possess
and cannot reasonably obtain evidence needed to support the defense”];  Kendall-Jackson Winery, Ltd. v. Sup.Ct.
(1999) 76 Cal. App. 4th 970, 977.)
          Unopposed declarations must be accepted as true. (CCP §
437c(e).) However, affidavits must be liberally construed in favor of the
opposition and strictly construed against the moving party in determining the
existence of a "triable issue" of fact. (D'Amico v. Board of
Medical Examiners (1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 21.)
III.     ANALYSIS
i. Undisputed Material
Facts
Pursuant to the separate statement, Carrey admitted in
discovery that she had no facts or witnesses to support the first affirmative
defense, comparative negligence. (UMFs 5-7.) Carrey admitted in discovery that
she had no facts or witnesses to support the second affirmative defense,
liability apportionment. (UMFs 8-10.) Carrey admitted in discovery that she had
no facts or witnesses to support the third affirmative defense, proposition 51.
(UMFs 11-13.)
In response to the separate statement, Defendant
argues that she had already agreed to withdraw these defenses, on February 29,
2024. (Response to Separate Statement UMFs 5-14.) 
ii. Motion for Summary
Adjudication of Carrey’s Affirmative Defenses
Plaintiff
contends that Defendant has provided factually devoid discovery responses in
support of these affirmative defenses. A moving party may rely on factually
devoid discovery responses to shift the burden of proof.¿¿(Collin v.
CalPortland Co.¿(2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 582, 587;¿Union Bank v. Superior
Court¿(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 573, 590.)¿ However, the discovery must be
sufficiently comprehensive¿to¿establish that the opposing party either does not
then have, and cannot reasonably obtain, evidence on a necessary element of
their claim. (Collin, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at 587 [“(D)efendant¿may
show through factually devoid discovery responses that the plaintiff does not
possess and cannot reasonably obtain needed evidence.”];¿Weber v. John
Crane, Inc.¿(2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1433, 1441–1442 [defendant does not
satisfy its burden of proof by producing discovery responses that do not
exclude the possibility that plaintiffs may possess or may reasonably obtain
evidence sufficient to establish their claim];¿Scheiding¿v. Dinwiddie Const.
Co.¿(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 64, 80–81.)¿¿“There must be some ‘affirmative
showing’ by the moving defendant that plaintiff could not obtain such evidence,
before summary judgment would be proper.”¿¿(Krantz v. BT Visual Images, LLC¿(2001)
89 Cal.App.4th 164, 173.)
Plaintiff
provides Carrey’s discovery responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One and excerpts
of Carrey’s deposition testimony. (See Genson Decl. Exhs. C, D.) Carrey
responded to the discovery requests that she did not have any facts supporting
her affirmative defenses, nor witnesses nor documents. (See Genson Decl. Exh. C:
Special Interrogatories Nos. 23-25, 26-28, 29-31.)
In her
opposition, Carrey does not oppose the merits of the motion but urges the Court
that she had previously agreed to withdraw these defenses. (See Opposition p. 5:
21-28.) This is supported by the declaration of her counsel, Peter J. Gates,
who attaches email correspondence with Plaintiff’s counsel indicating that
Defendant will withdraw the defenses. (See Gates Decl. Exh. D.) From the
record, it appears that Plaintiff’s counsel emailed the request to remove the
defenses on February 13, 2024, Defense counsel responded on February 29, 2024,
and this motion was filed by Plaintiff’s counsel on March 1, 2024. (Gates Decl.
Exhs. C and D.) Indeed, Defendant also filed a motion for leave to amend her
answer and remove the three affirmative defenses. (See Gates Decl. Exh. E.) Contrary
to Defendant's assertions, this course of events does not render the motion
moot.
Plaintiff’s
motion for summary adjudication of Defendant’s 1st, 2nd and third affirmative
defenses is granted. 
IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
           Plaintiff Craig Renwick’s motion for summary
adjudication is GRANTED. Counsel for Renwick to give notice.
