BACKGROUND
 
On August 30, 2022, Plaintiff Salon Republic, LLC
(“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendant Jazmine Lashai Bondurant aka
Jazmine Bondurnt (“Defendant”) for breach of contract and common counts.
 
On November 7, 2022, Defendant, in propria persona, filed
an Answer to the Complaint. Defendant filed an Amended Answer on January 24,
2023. 
 
On April 11, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories and for Award of Sanctions. On July 24, 2023,
the Court granted the Motion, ordered Defendant to submit verified responses,
without objections, and to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $660.
(7-24-23 Minute Order.) 
 
On April 11, 2023, Plaintiff also filed a Motion to Compel
Responses to Requests for Production of Documents and for Award of Sanctions
(“MTC RFP”). On July 24, 2023, the Court noted deficiencies in the Motion and
continued the hearing to August 23, 2023, to allow Plaintiff an opportunity to
correct these deficiencies. On July 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed supplemental
papers. Plaintiff indicated that it intended to submit on the moving papers
without appearing at the hearing.  On
August 23, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s MTC RFP and its request for
monetary sanctions in the amount of $660.
 
On May 24, 2023, the Court found that the case is not a
“Collection Hub” matter and ordered it transferred for re-assignment. The case
was reassigned to Department 25 at the Spring Street Courthouse. 
 
On June 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Deem Matters
Admitted and for Monetary Sanctions. The Court granted the Motion and
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $680. 
 
 
 
On October 19, 2023, the Court granted the parties’ request
to continue the trial date to finalize settlement negotiations. 
 
On January 09, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to
Enforce Settlement and Enter Judgment Against Defendant Pursuant to CCP 664.6. 
                        
No opposition has been filed. 
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
Plaintiff prays for the Court to enforce
the terms of the settlement and enter judgment against the Defendant. Plaintiff
argues that because Defendant has failed to adhere to the terms of the Stipulation
for the Conditional Entry of Judgment signed by the parties, Plaintiff is
entitled to judgment under CCP 664.6. Plaintiff requests judgment be entered
against Defendant for $42,675.08, which is the sum of the principal amount of
$32,292.11, plus $469.00 in cost, $8,555.24 in interest, and $1,358.73 in
attorney’s fees.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
 Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6
(“CCP § 664.6”) states: “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a) [emphasis added].) For
purposes of the statute, “a writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any
of the following [among other individuals]: (1) ¶ The party. (2) ¶ An attorney
who represents the party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b) [emphasis
added].) 
 
“On a motion to enforce, the court
must determine whether the settlement agreement is valid and binding.
[Citation.] The court assesses whether the material terms of the settlement
were reasonably well-defined and certain, and whether the parties expressly
acknowledged that they understood and agreed to be bound by those terms. [In
re Marriage of Assemi (1994) 7 Cal.4th 896, 911.]” (Estate of
Jones (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 948, 952.) 
 
The court may
interpret the terms and conditions of a settlement (Fiore v. Alvord
(1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 566), but the court may not create material terms of
a settlement, as opposed to deciding what terms the parties themselves have
previously agreed upon (Weddington Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60
Cal.App.4th 793, 810). 
 
II.        Discussion 
 
A.
Retention of Jurisdiction
            
“‘[V]oluntary dismissal of an action or special
proceeding terminates the court’s jurisdiction over the matter.’ (Conservatorship
of Martha P. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 857, 867.) ‘If requested by the
parties,’ however, ‘the [trial] court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce [a] settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.’ (§ 664.6, italics added.)” (Mesa RHF Partners, L.P. v. City of
Los Angeles (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 913, 917.) “‘Because of its summary
nature, strict compliance with the requirements of section 664.6 is
prerequisite to invoking the power of the court to impose a settlement
agreement.’” (Id. (quoting Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v.
Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37).)
 
“A request for the trial court to retain jurisdiction
under section 664.6 ‘must conform to the same three requirements which the
Legislature and the courts have deemed necessary for section 664.6 enforcement
of the settlement itself: the request must be made (1) during the pendency of
the case, not after the case has been dismissed in its entirety, (2) by the
parties themselves, and (3) either in a writing signed by the parties or orally
before the court.’” (Id. (quoting Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th
429, 440).) “The ‘request must be express, not implied from other language, and
it must be clear and unambiguous.’” (Id. (quoting Wackeen, supra,
97 Cal.App.4th at 440).)
 
Here,
the parties signed a stipulation containing the parties’ agreement for the
Court to retain jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure §664.6 to enforce
the terms of the Stipulation and enter judgment in the event of default. (Mot.
Exh. A ¶ 3.) The Court notes that neither party moved to dismiss the suit
pursuant to CCP 664.6 nor did the parties file notice that the parties had
reached a settlement. Regardless, since the matter remains active, the Court
still has jurisdiction over the case. Therefore, the Court proceeds to the merits
of the instant motion. 
 
B.
Entry of Judgment 
The Settlement Agreement (“Stipulation”)
provides that the parties agree to settle the matter for a total sum of $44,243.76,
of which $32,342.11 being the principal balance, $823.50 for court cost, $6,211.49
towards interest and $4,866.66 towards attorney’s fees. (Mot. Exh A ¶ 1.) Defendant
committed to making monthly payments of $200.00 beginning on October 30, 2023, and
continuing on the 30th of each month, until paid in full within five-years of
the date of the first payment. (Id.) 
Plaintiff provides the court with the
declaration of its counsel who avers that to date Defendant has paid Plaintiff
$50.00. (Alexander V. Hettena Decl. ¶5.) Counsel states that Defendant has defaulted
on the terms of payment established under the Stipulation by failing to make
monthly payments. (Id. ¶ 3.) Plaintiff requests for judgment to be
entered against Defendant in the amount go $32,292.11 plus cost, interest, and
attorney’s fees per the terms of the agreement. (Id. ¶ 5.)
The Court
finds the Settlement Agreement valid and enforceable under CCP § 664.6. 
Here,
Plaintiff provides evidence that Defendant has not cured default after
Plaintiff sent notice. (Id. ¶¶
3, 5.) Plaintiff
requests judgment be entered against Defendant for $42,675.08, which is the sum
of the principal amount of $32,292.11, plus $469.00 in cost, $8,555.24 in
interest, and $1,358.73 in attorney’s fees. Thus, since a valid
and signed settlement agreement between the parties was breached, and the Court
retains jurisdiction to enter judgment, the motion satisfies the requirements
of CCP 664.6.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to Enforce Settlement
Agreement and Enter Judgment is GRANTED. Judgment is entered for Plaintiff and
against Defendant in the amount of $42,675.08 for the following: principal amount
of $32,292.11, plus $469.00 in cost, $8,555.24 in interest, and $1,358.73 in
attorney’s fees.
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
Plaintiff Salon Republic, LLC’s Motion to Enforce
Settlement and Enter Judgment Against the Defendant Pursuant to CCP 664.6 is
GRANTED.
 
Judgment is entered in favor of Plaintiff and against
Defendant in the TOTAL amount of $42,675.08


Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
