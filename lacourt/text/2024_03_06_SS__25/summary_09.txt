And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Plaintiff's Motion to Reclassify the case to unlimited jurisdiction is denied. The Plaintiff, Abigail Moroch, is seeking to reclassify the case because the new claims raised in the First Amended Complaint (FAC) raise her recovery above the jurisdictional limit. The Defendant, Westlake Services, LLC, argues that the Plaintiff's damages will not exceed $25,000 and that the Plaintiff waived the claims under the terms of the Settlement Agreement.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has demonstrated a possibility that her claimed damages will exceed $25,000 and the new jurisdictional amount of $35,000, but the Judge is not convinced that the Plaintiff meets her burden of showing good cause for not seeking reclassification earlier. The Judge concludes that the Plaintiff's delay in seeking reclassification was not justified and that the Plaintiff fails to show good cause for the significant delay in time.

The Judge's ruling is based on the Code of Civil Procedure and the Court's analysis of the case. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff has not adequately justified the eight-month gap between when the FAC was filed and when the instant motion was filed, and that the Plaintiff's speculation regarding settlement of the matter is not sufficient to support the delay.
