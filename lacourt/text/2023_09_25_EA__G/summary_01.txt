And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Lakeview Loan Servicing, LLC's application for default judgment is granted. The case involves an action for cancellation of instruments and declaratory judgment, stemming from a loan obtained by Wayne Situ and Lilian Li in 2019. Lakeview discovered that the property was encumbered by multiple additional deeds of trust, which it has been unable to obtain payoff-statement of reconveyance for. The judge has found that Lakeview has submitted sufficient evidence to support its application for default judgment, and has granted the application. The court notes that a prove-up hearing is not required in this case, as Lakeview is only seeking to cancel instruments and not to quiet title.
