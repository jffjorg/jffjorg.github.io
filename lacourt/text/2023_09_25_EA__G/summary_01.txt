The case involves an action for cancellation of instruments and declaratory judgment, stemming from a loan obtained by Wayne Situ and Lilian Li in 2019. Lakeview discovered that the property was encumbered by multiple additional deeds of trust, which it has been unable to obtain payoff-statement of reconveyance for. The judge has found that Lakeview has submitted sufficient evidence to support its application for default judgment, and has granted the application. The court notes that a prove-up hearing is not required in this case, as Lakeview is only seeking to cancel instruments and not to quiet title.

## English Summary

This is a tentative ruling on Lakeview Loan Servicing, LLC's application for default judgment against the Rasmussen successors and Rousselle successors.

Lakeview obtained a loan assignment from Flagstar Bank and subsequently discovered three additional deeds of trust on the property.  Lakeview filed a lawsuit seeking cancellation of these instruments and a declaratory judgment. Both the Rasmussen and Rousselle successors failed to respond to the lawsuit, leading to entry of default. 

The judge finds that Lakeview has provided sufficient evidence to support their application for default judgment. While a prove-up hearing is typically required for title disputes, the court notes that Lakeview is not seeking to quiet title, but only to cancel instruments.  Therefore, the judge grants Lakeview's application for default judgment.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the application for default judgment filed by Lakeview Loan Servicing, LLC, seeking cancellation of instruments and declaratory judgment against various defendants. Despite the defendants' failure to respond to the complaint, the court finds that Lakeview has submitted sufficient evidence to support its application. Therefore, the court grants Lakeview's application for default judgment.

The court notes that, under Code of Civil Procedure section 585, a default judgment can be entered after a party has failed to timely respond or appear. Lakeview has complied with the necessary requirements for seeking default judgment, including filing a Request for Court Judgment and providing supporting evidence.

The court also notes that, while Code of Civil Procedure section 764.010 requires a prove-up hearing for determinations involving a plaintiff's title, Lakeview's action only seeks to cancel instruments and does not seek to quiet title. Therefore, a prove-up hearing is not required in this case.

In conclusion, the court grants Lakeview's application for default judgment, canceling the instruments and declaring the judgment sought by the plaintiff.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Lakeview Loan Servicing, LLC's application for default judgment against the Rasmussen successors and Rousselle successors. The case involves a dispute over the ownership and validity of certain deeds of trust on a property in El Monte. Lakeview had obtained a loan from Flagstar Bank, FSB, which was secured by a deed of trust on the property. However, Lakeview discovered that the property was encumbered by additional deeds of trust, which had not been paid off. Lakeview filed a complaint against the Rasmussen successors, Rousselle, and Xinchen, LLC, seeking cancellation of instruments and declaratory judgment. After serving process on the defendants, Lakeview submitted an application for default judgment, which the court has granted. The court found that Lakeview had submitted sufficient evidence to support its application and that a prove-up hearing was not required in this case, as Lakeview was only seeking to cancel instruments and not to quiet title. The court's ruling is based on the Code of Civil Procedure sections 585 and 764.010, as well as relevant case law, including Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. v. Pyle.
