## English Summary

This is a tentative ruling on Lakeview Loan Servicing, LLC's application for default judgment against the Rasmussen successors and Rousselle successors.

Lakeview obtained a loan assignment from Flagstar Bank and subsequently discovered three additional deeds of trust on the property.  Lakeview filed a lawsuit seeking cancellation of these instruments and a declaratory judgment. Both the Rasmussen and Rousselle successors failed to respond to the lawsuit, leading to entry of default. 

The judge finds that Lakeview has provided sufficient evidence to support their application for default judgment. While a prove-up hearing is typically required for title disputes, the court notes that Lakeview is not seeking to quiet title, but only to cancel instruments.  Therefore, the judge grants Lakeview's application for default judgment.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the application for default judgment filed by Lakeview Loan Servicing, LLC, seeking cancellation of instruments and declaratory judgment against various defendants. Despite the defendants' failure to respond to the complaint, the court finds that Lakeview has submitted sufficient evidence to support its application. Therefore, the court grants Lakeview's application for default judgment.

The court notes that, under Code of Civil Procedure section 585, a default judgment can be entered after a party has failed to timely respond or appear. Lakeview has complied with the necessary requirements for seeking default judgment, including filing a Request for Court Judgment and providing supporting evidence.

The court also notes that, while Code of Civil Procedure section 764.010 requires a prove-up hearing for determinations involving a plaintiff's title, Lakeview's action only seeks to cancel instruments and does not seek to quiet title. Therefore, a prove-up hearing is not required in this case.

In conclusion, the court grants Lakeview's application for default judgment, canceling the instruments and declaring the judgment sought by the plaintiff.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Lakeview Loan Servicing, LLC's application for default judgment against the Rasmussen successors and Rousselle successors. The case involves a dispute over the ownership and validity of certain deeds of trust on a property in El Monte. Lakeview had obtained a loan from Flagstar Bank, FSB, which was secured by a deed of trust on the property. However, Lakeview discovered that the property was encumbered by additional deeds of trust, which had not been paid off. Lakeview filed a complaint against the Rasmussen successors, Rousselle, and Xinchen, LLC, seeking cancellation of instruments and declaratory judgment. After serving process on the defendants, Lakeview submitted an application for default judgment, which the court has granted. The court found that Lakeview had submitted sufficient evidence to support its application and that a prove-up hearing was not required in this case, as Lakeview was only seeking to cancel instruments and not to quiet title. The court's ruling is based on the Code of Civil Procedure sections 585 and 764.010, as well as relevant case law, including Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. v. Pyle.

## Tentative Ruling Summary: Case Number 22PSCV01289

**Case Number:** 22PSCV01289
**Hearing Date:** September 25, 2023
**Department:** G

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Lakeview Loan Servicing, LLC
* **Defendants:**
    *  Unknown heirs, assigns, and devisees of Jack K. Rasmussen and Marguerite S. Rasmussen (Rasmussen successors)
    * Unknown heirs, assigns, and devisees of Richard Q. Rousselle (Rousselle successors)

**Background:**

* In 2019, Wayne Situ and Lilian Li (Borrowers) obtained a loan from Flagstar Bank, FSB (Flagstar) secured by a deed of trust on a property in El Monte.
* Flagstar assigned its interest in the deed of trust to Lakeview Loan Servicing, LLC (Lakeview).
* Lakeview discovered three additional deeds of trust encumbering the property, dating back to 1989 and 2017, and alleges they were paid off during a refinance. However, Lakeview has not received payoff statements or reconveyances from these parties (Rasmussen successors, Xinchen, LLC (Xinchen), and Richard Q. Rousselle).
* Lakeview filed a complaint against the successors and Does 1-20 in October 2022, alleging cancellation of instruments and declaratory judgment.
* Xinchen was dismissed from the action in November 2022.
* Default was entered against the Rasmussen successors in December 2022.
* Rousselle was dismissed and replaced with the Rousselle successors in February 2023. Default was entered against the Rousselle successors in May 2023.
* Lakeview filed an application for default judgment on August 25, 2023.

**Legal Standard:**

Code of Civil Procedure section 585 permits default judgment after a party fails to respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment must file a Request for Court Judgment with supporting evidence, interest computations, costs, a proposed judgment, and a request for attorney's fees if applicable.

**Analysis:**

* Lakeview seeks cancellation of instruments and declaratory judgment.
* The court finds Lakeview submitted sufficient evidence and grants their application for default judgment.
* While Code of Civil Procedure section 764.010 requires a prove-up hearing for title determinations, Lakeview argues it's not necessary here because they only seek cancellation, not quiet title.  The court agrees, citing *Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. v. Pyle (2017) 13 Cal.App.5th 513, 523*.

**Conclusion:**

Lakeview's application for default judgment is granted.


##  English Summary

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant Lakeview Loan Servicing, LLC's request for a default judgment against the Rasmussen and Rousselle successors. 

Lakeview filed this lawsuit to cancel three older deeds of trust on a property in El Monte that they discovered after acquiring the primary loan from Flagstar Bank. They allege these older deeds were paid off during a refinance but they haven't received proper documentation to confirm this.

Because the defendants didn't respond to the lawsuit, the judge is prepared to grant Lakeview's request for a default judgment. The judge found that Lakeview provided sufficient evidence to support their claim and that a special hearing (prove-up hearing) is not required in this case since Lakeview is only seeking to cancel the instruments, not to legally establish ownership of the property (quiet title).

**Summary:**

The tentative ruling for Case Number 22PSCV01289 grants Plaintiff Lakeview Loan Servicing, LLC's application for default judgment against Defendants Rasmussen successors, Richard Q. Rousselle successors, and unknown heirs, assigns, and devisees of Jack K. Rasmussen and Marguerite S. Rasmussen. The judgment is in the form of cancellation of instruments and declaratory judgment. Lakeview has provided sufficient evidence for the court to grant the default judgment, and a prove-up hearing is not required as it is distinct from an action to cancel an instrument. The hearing is set for September 25, 2023.
