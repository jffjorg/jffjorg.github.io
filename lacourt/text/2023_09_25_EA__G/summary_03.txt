And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 23PSCV01470, continuing the hearing on Rusnak/Pasadena's demurrer to the Avanessians' complaint to a date to be determined. The Judge finds that the parties did not adequately meet and confer before filing the demurrer, as Rusnak/Pasadena's counsel only sent a letter to the Avanessians' counsel, which is not a code-compliant form of meeting and conferring. The Judge orders Rusnak/Pasadena's counsel to meet and confer with the Avanessians' counsel regarding the demurrer and to file a supplemental declaration describing such meet and confer efforts at least nine court days before the next scheduled hearing.
