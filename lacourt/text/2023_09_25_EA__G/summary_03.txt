## English Text Summary

The judge has issued a tentative ruling continuing the hearing on Rusnak/Pasadena's demurrer to the plaintiffs' complaint. The demurrer specifically targets the plaintiffs' fourth cause of action alleging negligent repair.

The judge determined that Rusnak/Pasadena's counsel did not adequately meet and confer with the plaintiffs' counsel before filing the demurrer. While Rusnak/Pasadena's counsel sent a letter attempting to meet and confer, the judge found this insufficient under California law, which requires in-person or telephone meetings.

As a result, the hearing on the demurrer is continued to allow Rusnak/Pasadena's counsel to properly meet and confer with the plaintiffs' counsel. The judge ordered counsel to file a supplemental declaration describing their meet and confer efforts at least nine court days before the next scheduled hearing.

* Rusnak/Pasadena's counsel is ordered to meet and confer with Plaintiffs' counsel regarding the demurrer and file a supplemental declaration describing the meet and confer efforts at least nine court days before the next scheduled hearing.


## English Summary:

The judge is not yet ready to rule on Rusnak/Pasadena's request to dismiss the Avanessians' negligence claim. 

The judge found that Rusnak/Pasadena did not properly meet and confer with the plaintiffs before filing the demurrer, as they only sent a letter instead of speaking by phone or in person. 

Therefore, the hearing on the demurrer is postponed, and Rusnak/Pasadena's lawyer is required to meet with the plaintiffs' lawyer to discuss the issue and then file a report about their conversation with the court.

### English Summary of the Tentative Ruling
The Judge has made a tentative ruling regarding the case of Hamlet Avanessian and Ayris Avanessian vs. Rusnak/Pasadena, et al. The defendants had filed a demurrer, which is a legal objection to the complaint. However, the court found that the defendants' counsel did not properly meet and confer with the plaintiffs' counsel as required by law. As a result, the court has continued the hearing on the demurrer to a later date and ordered the defendants' counsel to meet and confer with the plaintiffs' counsel and file a supplemental declaration describing their efforts. The case is a lemon law action, and the plaintiffs are alleging that the defendants sold them a defective vehicle. The court will reconsider the demurrer after the parties have had a chance to meet and confer.

**Case Number:** 23PSCV01470

**Hearing Date:** September 25, 2023

**Parties:**

- Plaintiffs: Hamlet Avanessian and Ayris Avanessian
- Defendants: Volkswagen, Rusnak/Pasadena, Does 1-10

**Background:**

- On December 3, 2020, Plaintiffs entered into a warranty contract with Defendant Volkswagen Group of America, Inc., by leasing a 2020 Audi A4.
- Plaintiffs allege the vehicle was delivered with transmission, electrical, suspension, engine, and structural system defects.
- On May 15, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Defendants, alleging breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty, violation of Song-Beverly Act section 1793.2, subdivision (b), and negligent repair.
- On July 21, 2023, Rusnak/Pasadena filed a demurrer.

**Tentative Ruling:**

- Rusnak/Pasadena's demurrer is CONTINUED to a date to be determined at the hearing in Department G (Pomona).
- Rusnak/Pasadena's counsel is ordered to meet and confer with Plaintiffs' counsel regarding the Demurrer and to file a supplemental declaration describing such meet and confer efforts at least nine (9) court days before the next scheduled hearing.

**Reasoning:**

- Plaintiffs and Defendants did not adequately meet and confer.
- Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a) requires a demurring party to meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer.
- Rusnak/Pasadena's counsel sent a letter, but did not attempt to reach out over the telephone or in-person, which is insufficient for meeting and conferring under the code.

**Significant Statements:**

- "The demurring party shall identify all of the specific causes of action that it believes are subject to demurrer and identify with legal support the basis of the deficiencies." (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(1).)
- Failing to meet and confer is not grounds to overrule a demurrer, but courts retain discretion to order counsel to meaningfully discuss the pleadings with an eye toward reducing the number of issues or eliminating the need for a demurrer. (Dumas v. Los Angeles County Bd. of Supervisors (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 348, 355 & fn. 3.)
