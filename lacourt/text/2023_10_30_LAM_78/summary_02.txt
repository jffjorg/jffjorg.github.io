And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment in this unlawful detainer action. The Plaintiff, BLVD FOODS LLC, is seeking to evict the Defendant, THE CHICKEN KOOP LLC, from a commercial property due to non-payment of rent. The Plaintiff argues that the Defendant defaulted on its rent payments and failed to respond to a 10-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit. The Defendant opposes the motion, alleging that there are triable issues of material fact regarding whether the notice was served in accordance with the commercial lease and whether it was posted at the subject property.

The judge finds that the Plaintiff has met its burden of showing that the Defendant is in possession of the premises and has defaulted on its rent payments. However, the judge also finds that the Defendant has raised a triable issue of material fact regarding whether the notice was posted at the subject property. The judge notes that the Plaintiff's declaration lacks evidence of whether others working at the restaurant could have found the notice, and that the Defendant's Chief Executive Officer testified that she and her employees did not find a copy of the notice posted at the subject property. Therefore, the judge denies the Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and allows the case to proceed to trial.
