And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the motion to dismiss filed by Defendants Behrendt, Jeremy Shepherd, and Hisano Shepherd, without prejudice, as to Plaintiffs Emanuel M.H., Jr. and Bella M.H. This means that the defendants are dismissed from the case without prejudice.

The judge has also set a hearing for December 12, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. to discuss the dismissal and to set a status conference for the same date. The judge has ordered the parties to provide notice and proof of service of the notice to the parties and to file the proof of service within five court days after the date of the order.

The judge's ruling is based on the failure of the minor plaintiffs to appoint a guardian ad litem, which is required by law. The judge has also considered the failure of the parties to serve discovery on the minor plaintiffs and the lack of diligence in prosecuting the case.

The judge has noted that the case has been pending for multiple years, and that the parties have not been diligent in prosecuting the case. The judge has also noted that the defendants have been prejudiced by the lack of discovery and have not been able to prepare for the trial.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is a significant development in the case, and it may have significant implications for the remaining parties.
