* The Court finds that the Subpoenas are overbroad in scope and seek production of documents that are not relevant to the instant case or are invasive of Plaintiff's right to privacy

* "The party asserting a privacy right must establish a legally protected privacy interest, an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the given circumstances, and a threatened intrusion that is serious." (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 552)
* "Defendant fails to establish a compelling need for Plaintiffs' employment records and/or a compelling interest that outweighs Plaintiffs' right to privacy with respect to her comprehensive employment records."
