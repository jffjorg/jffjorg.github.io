And here is the summary in English text:

Judge Mel Red Recana has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Counsel Zachary Levine to be relieved as counsel for Unbounded Entertainment Group, Inc. The court has reviewed the motion and finds that Counsel Levine has not fulfilled all requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362. Additionally, the court notes that Counsel Levine has not provided a proposed order relieving him as counsel. Despite this, the court finds proper basis for withdrawal due to the breakdown in communication between Counsel Levine and Unbounded Entertainment Group, Inc. and the client's breach of the retainer agreement. However, the court denies the motion due to Counsel Levine's failure to indicate whether he gave the client a reasonable warning that he would withdraw after the breach.
