And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Mel Red Recana has granted Defendant Irene Chan's motion to continue the trial date, currently set for November 12, 2024, to fall of 2025. The judge found that there is good cause for the continuance, citing the need for additional discovery and the unavailability of Defendant Chan's counsel due to another trial commitment. The judge also noted that the parties had previously stipulated to continue the trial date until mid-2025, and that Plaintiff Hoi Ying Eugenie Lai does not oppose the continuance. The judge ordered the trial date to be continued to fall of 2025, with the specific date to be determined at a later time.
