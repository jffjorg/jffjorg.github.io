And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a employment dispute case between Markeitha Harris and Vanessa Johnson (Plaintiffs) against the County of Los Angeles (Defendant). The Defendant has moved for a protective order to withdraw deposition notices propounded by the Plaintiffs, and the Plaintiffs have requested monetary sanctions against the Defendant.

The Judge has denied the Defendant's motion for a protective order, finding that the Defendant has not shown good cause for the order. The Judge also denied the request for monetary sanctions by both parties, finding that both parties' counsel engaged in conduct which resulted in the miscommunication and instant motion.

The case involves claims of employment discrimination and harassment under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), Labor Code, and other tort claims. The Plaintiffs had filed a complaint and two amended complaints against the Defendant, and the Defendant had filed a demurrer to the First Amended Complaint, which was sustained and resulted in the dismissal of one of the Plaintiffs without prejudice.

The Judge has ordered that the parties meet and confer in good faith to resolve any disputes, and has denied the request for sanctions by both parties. The case is set for trial on April 7, 2025.
