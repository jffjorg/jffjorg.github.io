  Case Number:  23CHCV01423    Hearing Date:   April 26, 2024    Dept:  F49    Dept.    F49      Date:    4/26/24     Case    Name:  Ludivina Tovar v. American    Honda Motor Co., Inc., and Does 1-10     Case    # 23CHCV01423      LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT F49    APRIL 26, 2024    MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER  RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF’S SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES NOS. 10, 46-48, SET ONE;  REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS   Los Angeles Superior  Court Case # 23CHCV01423    Motion  filed: 2/20/24   MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff Ludivina Tovar (“Plaintiff”)   RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant American Honda Motor  Co., Inc. (“AHM” or “Defendant”) NOTICE: OK    RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order from this Court compelling AHM to provide further responses to  Plaintiff’s first set of Special Interrogatories Nos. 10, 46-48, and imposing  monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,185.00 against AHM and its attorney of  record.    TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is DENIED. The request for monetary sanctions is DENIED.   BACKGROUND   Plaintiff filed this lawsuit under the Song-Beverly Consumer  Warranty Act over alleged defects in her 2022 Honda HR-V (the “Subject Vehicle”),  which was manufactured by Defendant AHM. Plaintiff alleges that she purchased  the Vehicle in new condition on February 28, 2022, with AHM’s express manufacturer’s  warranty.   On May 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed her Complaint against  Defendant AHM and Does 1–10, alleging the following causes of action: (1) Violation  of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty, and (2) Violation of  Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty. Subsequently, AHM filed its  Answer to the Complaint on June 21, 2023.   On February 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to  Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Nos. 10, 46-48, Set One  (the “Motion”). Subsequently, on April 15, 2024, AHM filed its Opposition.  Plaintiff’s Reply was timely filed on April 19, 2024.   ANALYSIS   “On receipt of a response to  interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a  further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following  apply:(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.  (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230  is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate.  (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.” (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).)   A.     Procedural  Requirements   1.      45-Day  Rule   Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure  section 2030.300, subdivision (c), notice of this motion must be given within 45 days following  the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or  by a later date agreed-upon in writing, failing which the propounding party  waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c).)   AHM served its responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories,  Set One, on December 5, 2023. (Tran Decl., ¶ 4.) This establishes the deadline  for Plaintiff to file a motion to compel further responses as January 19, 2024.  However, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion on February 20, 2024, failing to  meet the deadline.    Nevertheless, given that AHM does not contest the  issue of timeliness, the Court proceeds to review the Motion, operating under  the assumption that both parties have stipulated an extension for filing.   2.      Meet  and Confer   “A motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a  meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., §  2030.300, subd. (b)(1).)              After receiving AHM’s responses on December 5, 2023,  Plaintiff sent Defendant a meet and confer letter on January 9, 2024. (Tran  Decl., ¶ 5.) AHM responded on January 16, 2024, requesting a telephonic meet  and confer. (Id., ¶ 6.) Subsequently, the parties telephonically met and  conferred on January 19, 2024, discussing the issues raised in the instant  Motion. (Id., ¶ 7.) However, the parties were not able to resolve all the  disputes, including those related to Special Interrogatories, Nos. 46-48. (Ibid.)  Additionally, AHM agreed to supplement its responses to Special Interrogatories,  No. 10 by February 19, 2024; however, no responses have been received from  Defendant by the time of the filing of the Motion. (Tran Decl., ¶¶ 7-8.)   Therefore, the Court determines that the meet and  confer requirements have been satisfied.    3.      Separate  Statement   A motion to compel further responses to interrogatories  must be accompanied by a separate statement. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1345(a)(3).) “A separate statement is a separate document filed and served  with the discovery motion that provides all the information necessary to  understand each discovery request and all the responses to it that are at  issue.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(c).)   Plaintiff has met the above requirement  by filing a separate statement explaining the interrogatories at issue, Defendant’s  responses, and why further responses are necessary.   B.      Mootness   On April 23, 2024, Plaintiff  filed a supplemental declaration, attesting that they had received AHM’s  supplemental responses to Special Interrogatories, No. 10, on April 18, 2024, subsequent  to the filing of the Motion. (Lupinek Decl., ¶¶ 2-4.)   Based on this record, the Court deems the Motion to  compel further responses to Special Interrogatories, No. 10 as moot.   C.     Motion to  Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Nos. 46-48   Plaintiff moves to compel AHM to provide  supplemental responses to Special Interrogatories, Nos. 46-48.   No. 46 asks, “State the repairs per  thousand vehicles sold (R/1000) for 2022 Honda HR-V vehicles.” (Tran Decl., Ex.  “A,” at p. 8.)   No.  47 requests, “Identify in order the five symptoms with the highest repairs per  thousand (R/1000) for 2022 Honda HR-V vehicles, and the corresponding repairs  per thousand.” (Tran Decl., Ex. “A,” at p. 8.)   No.  48 seeks, “Identify in order the five components with the highest repairs per  thousand (R/1000) for 2022 Honda HR-V vehicles, and the corresponding repairs  per thousand. (Tran Decl., Ex. “A,” at p. 8.)   “As a  general matter, the statutory scheme imposes no obligation on a party propounding  interrogatories to establish good cause or prove up the merits of any  underlying claims.” (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th  531, 550.) Indeed, a litigant “is entitled to demand answers to its  interrogatories, as a matter of right, and without a prior showing, unless the  party on whom those interrogatories are served objects and shows cause why the  questions are not within the purview of the code section.” (Id., at p.  541, citing West Pico Furniture Co. v. Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d  407, 422.)   Accordingly,  the Court will first examine whether AHM’s objections have satisfied its burden  to show cause.   1.       AHM’s  Objections   AHM objects on the basis of irrelevance,  arguing that Special Interrogatories Nos. 46-48 seek information not connected to  this lawsuit and are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of  admissible evidence. (Def.’s Separate Statement, at p. 9.) Additionally, AHM  raises objections on the grounds of overbreadth, vagueness, ambiguity, being  unduly burdensome, and involving trade secret. (See generally, Def.’s Separate  Statement.)   AHM contends that these requests are  unintelligible, as the terms “repairs per thousand vehicles sold,” “symptoms,”  “highest repairs,” and “repairs per thousand” are not defined or explained.  (Opp’n., at p. 6.) Additionally, AHM maintains that these requests seek  information about “completely different and unrelated symptoms and components.”  (Ibid.)   Code of Civil  Procedure section 2017.010 permits a party to “obtain discovery regarding any  matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter . . . if the  matter is either itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated  to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” Furthermore, established case  law instructs,    “For discovery  purposes, information should be regarded as ‘relevant’ to the subject matter if  it might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial,  or facilitating settlement. (Gonzalez v. Sup.Ct.  (1995) 33 CA4th  1539, 1546 (citing text); Lipton v. Sup.Ct. (1996) 48 CA4th 1599, 1611  (citing text); Stewart v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc. (2001) 87 CA4th  1006, 1013 (citing text).)    In Donlen v. Ford Motor Co.  (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 138, 154 (Donlen), the Third District held that  the trial court had not erred in denying Ford’s motion in limine to exclude  evidence of other customers’ complaints about the same transmission model Ford  installed in plaintiff’s truck and other vehicles. (Underlines added.) Similarly,  in Jensen v. BMW of North America, LLC (S.D.Cal. 2019) 328 F.R.D. 557,  562-63 (Jensen), the federal district court in San Diego found that,  “information regarding whether the same defects were reported to BMW in  other cars of the same make, model, and year as Plaintiff’s subject vehicle could  conceivably be relevant to whether BMW acted reasonably in denying Plaintiff’s  warranty claim. A fact finder may find BMW’s knowledge or lack of knowledge  about the same defects to be a consideration in deciding whether BMW acted in  good faith as to Plaintiff’s specific case.”   (Underlines added.)   Here, Plaintiff’s request seeks “repairs  per thousand vehicles sold for 2022 Honda HR-V vehicles.” (Special  Interrogatories, No. 46.) Although Plaintiff’s request sets the scope to the  same year and model of Plaintiff’s subject Vehicle, it does not limit the data  to the same or same nature of reported defects by Plaintiff.    Similarly, Special Interrogatories Nos.  47-48 seek information about the top five symptoms/components with the highest  repairs, and the corresponding repairs per thousand 2022 Honda HR-V vehicles. The  Court finds these requests do not bear direct relevance to the specific defects  alleged in this case. Furthermore, the Court determines that their sweeping  scope is overly broad. While Plaintiff contends that the information could  indicate “AHM’s knowledge of widespread problems, and AHM’s failure to act  despite this knowledge” (Mot., at p. 4), the Court finds this argument  unpersuasive. The relevance of a manufacturer’s knowledge and inaction should be  directly connected to the defects as specifically alleged in the case, irrespective  of whether the alleged defects are among the most frequent issues for the same  model.   In alignment with established  precedents, including those set in Dolen and Jensen, the Court  concludes that information sought by Special Interrogatories, Nos. 46-48, is  irrelevant and overbroad.   Therefore, the Court DENIES the Motion.     D.     Monetary Sanctions   As the Court has DENIED the Motion, the request for  monetary sanction, reserved for a prevailing party under Code of Civil  Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (d), is also DENIED.    CONCLUSION   Plaintiff’s  Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Nos. 10, and  46-48, Set One, is DENIED.   Plaintiff’s  Request for Monetary Sanctions is DENIED.    Moving  party is to give notice.
