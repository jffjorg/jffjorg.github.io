TENTATIVE ORDER
 
     I.       
Defendant Penn-Star Insurance Company’s
Motion for Order Putting Anti-SLAPP Motion Back on Calendar; Vacating Nunc Pro
Tunc the Court’s September 11, 2024 Order of Dismissal without prejudice; and
Entering Dismissal with prejudice is GRANTED.
    II.       
Defendant Penn-Star Insurance Company’s
Special Motion to Strike pursuant to CCP § 425.16 and Request for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs in the amount
of 27,347.50 is GRANTED.  
 
Moving party to give notice. 
 
This action was filed by Plaintiff Henry Aguila
(“Plaintiff”) on May 5, 2022. The complaint alleges that Defendant Penn-Star
Insurance Company (“PSIC”) was Plaintiff’s commercial liability insurer who
tendered a defense for Plaintiff in one of the lawsuits between Eva Meneses
(“Meneses”), Edgar Fragoso (“Fragoso”), Century Law Group LLP (“CLG”), and
Plaintiff. (Complaint, ¶ 12.) 
 
The complaint alleges the following causes of action against
Defendants PSIC, Meneses, Fragoso, CLG, and DOES 1 to 20, inclusive
(collectively, “Defendants”): (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of covenant of
good faith and fair dealing; (3) inducing breach of contract; (4) intentional
infliction of emotional distress; and (5) negligence. 
 
On May 19, 2022, Defendant CLG filed and served a notice of
remand, indicating that it had filed a notice of removal to the United States
District Court for the Central District of California. 
 
On June 16, 2022, this action was remanded from the United
States District Court for the Central District of California back to this
Court. 
 
On July 19, 2022, pursuant to a request for dismissal filed
by Plaintiff, Defendant CLG was dismissed from this action without prejudice. 
 
On July 25, 2022, Defendant PSIC filed a demurrer to the
complaint.
 
On August 15, 2022, Defendant PSIC filed a special motion to
strike pursuant to CCP § 425.16 and request for attorneys’ fees and costs in
the amount of $27,347.50. 
 
On September 2, 2022, Defendants Meneses and Fragoso filed
respective answers to the complaint. 
 
On September 20, 2022, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the
demurrer, to which Defendant PSIC replied on October 11, 2022.   
 
On October 21, 2022, after hearing oral argument and taking
the matter under submission, the Court issued an order staying this action
pending the appellate court ruling in the Federal action. (10/21/22 Minute
Order.) The Court took judicial notice of multiple federal court actions
involving the parties. (10/21/22 Minute Order at p. 2.) The Court noted the
following in its order: On December 2, 2021, PSIC “filed a
Complaint-in-Interpleader in federal court titled Penn-Star Insurance Company,
Inc. v. Thee Aguila, Inc. (C.D. Cal. Case No. 2:21-cv-09365 PSG (RAOx)
(“Interpleader Action”).” (10/21/22 Minute Order at p. 3.) On March 29, 2022,
the court in the Interpleader Action issued an order which stated, in part,
that upon PSIC depositing the interpleader funds, PSIC would “be discharged
from further liability to Defendants-In-Interpleader for the judgment proceeds.
Defendants-in-Interpleader, including Aguila, shall be restrained and enjoined
from bringing any future action or proceeding in any state or federal court
against Penn-Star for recovery of the judgment proceeds or any applicable
interest thereon.” (10/21/22 Minute Order at p. 4.) 
 
The Court also noted in its order that “[o]n April 5, 2022,
the day before Penn-Star was able to deposit the Judgment Sums with the federal
court clerk and without prior notice to Penn-Star, Aguila filed his Complaint
in this action . . . .” (10/21/22 Minute Order at p. 4.) The Court found that
all causes of action against PSIC were barred by the litigation privilege under
Civ. Code § 47(b) and the federal litigation privilege pursuant to the
Noerr-Pennington Doctrine. (10/21/22 Minute Order at p. 4.) The Court found
that the Interpleader Order discharged PSIC from liability; however, since
Plaintiff appealed the motion to amend the Interpleader Order, res judicata did
not yet apply because the federal order had not yet resulted in a final
judgment. (10/21/22 Minute Order at p. 5.) The Court therefore stayed this
action in its entirety based on principles of judicial comity. (10/21/22 Minute
Order at p. 5.) The Court advanced the hearing on Defendant PSIC’s anti-SLAPP
motion and vacated the hearing. (10/21/22 Minute Order at p. 5.) 
 
On November 10, 2022, after hearing, the Court granted
Defendant PSIC’s ex parte application for clarification/modification nunc
pro tunc of the Court’s order on the demurrer. (11/10/22 Minute Order.) The
Court corrected its October 21, 2022 minute order by clarifying that the
hearing on the special motion to strike under CCP § 425.16 scheduled for
November 29, 2022 was advanced to November 10, 2022 and vacated. (11/10/22
Minute Order at p. 1.) The Court indicated that “[t]he hearing of Penn-Star’s
motion is stayed, pending the federal court appeal.” (11/10/22 Minute Order at
p. 1.) 
 
On February 28, 2023, pursuant to a request for dismissal
filed by Plaintiff, Defendant Century Law Group was dismissed from this action
with prejudice. 
 
Also, on February 28, 2023, pursuant to a request for
dismissal filed by Plaintiff, Defendants Fragoso and Meneses were dismissed
from the complaint without prejudice. 
 
On December 11, 2023, at a case management conference,
defense counsel reported the “9th Circuit District Court [sic] ha[d] issued a
ruling.” (12/11/23 Minute Order.)  
 
On January 4, 2024, Defendant PSIC filed a motion to lift
stay, set a hearing on the special motion to strike, and/or grant the
previously filed special motion to strike and request for prevailing party
attorneys’ fees, which was unopposed by Plaintiff. 
 
On September 10, 2024, after hearing, the Court granted in
part the motion to lift stay, schedule hearing of and/or to grant the
previously filed anti-SLAPP motion and request for prevailing party attorneys’
fees. (09/10/24 Minute Order.) The Court lifted the stay on the grounds that
the Ninth Circuit ruled on the federal appeal and affirmed the Federal Amended
Interpleader Order directing Plaintiff to dismiss this action. (09/10/24 Minute
Order at p. 5.) The Court, however, declined to rule on the anti-SLAPP motion
because the stay had remained in effect until the date of the hearing.
(09/10/24 Minute Order at p. 5.) The Court specially set the hearing on the
anti-SLAPP motion for October 17, 2024. (09/10/24 Minute Order at p. 5.) 
 
On September 11, 2024, pursuant to a request for dismissal
filed by Plaintiff, Defendant PSIC was dismissed from this action without
prejudice. The Court subsequently placed the hearing on the anti-SLAPP motion
off-calendar. 
 
On September 13, 2024, Defendant PSIC filed an objection to
Plaintiff’s request for dismissal without prejudice. 
 
On September 16, 2024, Defendant PSIC filed and served the
instant motion to place the hearing on its special motion to strike back on
calendar, including its request for attorneys’ fees, vacating the clerk’s
September 11, 2024 dismissal of Plaintiff’s complaint without prejudice, and
entering a judgment of dismissal without prejudice. 
 
As of November 6, 2024, Defendant PSIC’s motion is
unopposed. Any opposition to the motion was required to have been filed and
served at least nine court days prior to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005,
subd. (b).) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Legal Standard
 
“[B]ecause a defendant who has been sued in violation of his
or her free speech rights is entitled to an award of attorney fees, the trial
court must, upon defendant’s motion for a fee award, rule on the merits of the
SLAPP motion even if the matter has been dismissed prior to the hearing on that
motion.” (Pfeiffer Venice Properties v. Bernard (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th
211, 218.) The trial court must hear the anti-SLAPP motion even when the action
“is voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff.” (Ibid.) “The fee motion is
wholly dependent upon a determination of the merits of the SLAPP motion.” (Ibid.)
“[T]he trial court is required to rule on the merits of the motion, and to
award attorney fees when a defendant demonstrates that plaintiff’s action falls
within the provisions of subdivision (b) and the plaintiff is unable to
establish a reasonable probability of success.” (Ibid.) 
 
Analysis
 
A.  
Declaration of Counsel for Defendant PSIC
 
In support of the
instant motion, counsel for Defendant PSIC, James P. Lemeiux (“Lemeiux”)
provides a declaration. Mr. Lemeiux states the following: Plaintiff filed this
state court action on April 5, 2022, over two years ago, after the U.S.
District Court discharged PSIC from any liability to Plaintiff upon deposit in
interpleader of sums in satisfaction of a judgment in favor of Plaintiff and
against PSIC in a related federal action, which sums were the subject of
competing creditor claims. (Lemeiux Decl., ¶ 2.) The Interpleader Order
enjoined Plaintiff from filing any further actions against PSIC pertaining to
recovery of said funds. (Lemeiux Decl., ¶ 2.) Before PSIC could deposit the
interpleader sums with the federal court, Plaintiff raced to this courthouse
and filed the instant action. (Lemeiux Decl., ¶ 2.) Thereafter, the District
Court amended its Interpleader Order directing Plaintiff to dismiss this state
action with prejudice. (Lemeiux Decl., ¶ 2.) Before PSIC could enforce the
federal amended interpleader order, which directed Plaintiff to dismiss this
action, Plaintiff rushed to the federal courthouse and appealed such order.
(Lemeiux Decl., ¶ 3.) 
 
PSIC demurred to
Plaintiff’s complaint on two alternative and independent grounds. (Lemeiux
Decl., ¶ 4.) PSIC also filed an anti-SLAPP motion based upon litigation
privileges and requested that the Court dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint and award
PSIC its attorneys’ fees pursuant to CCP § 425.16. (Lemeiux Decl., ¶ 5.) The
hearing on the demurrer occurred first and the Court held that the litigation
privileges did indeed bar Plaintiff’s complaint but also observed that the
federal Amended Interpleader Order was on appeal and therefore not yet final.
(Lemeiux Decl., ¶ 6.) The Court therefore stayed this action pending the
outcome of the federal appeal and, by an amended ruling nunc pro tunc,
clarified that the stay included the hearing on PSIC’s anti-SLAPP motion for an
award of prevailing party attorneys’ fees, which motion would be heard after
the stay was lifted. (Lemeiux Decl., ¶ 6.) Thereafter, on October 27, 2023, the
Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court’s Amended Interpleader Order, holding
that none of Plaintiff’s claims made in this state action were independent of
PSIC’s decision to interplead funds and, therefore, the District Court ordered
Plaintiff to dismiss this action with prejudice. (Lemeiux Decl., ¶ 7.) The
Ninth Circuit’s decision became final on November 20, 2023, when it issued its
mandate. (Lemeiux Decl., ¶ 7.) 
 
On January 4, 2024,
PSIC filed a motion to lift the stay, and for a ruling on its stayed anti-SLAPP
motion, which includes a request for prevailing party attorneys’ fees. (Lemeiux
Decl., ¶ 8.) The Court heard the motion to lift stay on September 10, 2024, and
lifted the stay, but continued the hearing on the anti-SLAPP motion to October
17, 2024. (Lemeiux Decl., ¶ 8.) 
 
On September 10,
2024, Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal of the entire action without
prejudice. (Lemeiux Decl., ¶ 10.) PSIC filed an objection to the request for
dismissal and further requested that the Court proceed to hear the anti-SLAPP
motion and request for attorneys’ fees. (Lemeiux Decl., ¶ 11.) On September 11,
2024, the court clerk entered the dismissal and took the anti-SLAPP motion
off-calendar. (Lemeiux Decl., ¶ 12.) 
 
B.  
The Anti-SLAPP Motion Should Be Placed Back on
Calendar 

 
The Court finds that it must rule on Defendant PSIC’s
anti-SLAPP motion, which was placed off-calendar. Under Pfeiffer Venice
Properties v. Bernard, supra, 101 Cal.App.4th 211, 218, the Court
must rule on the merits of an anti-SLAPP motion even when an action is
voluntarily dismissed by a plaintiff. Thus, the Court must analyze the merits
of the anti-SLAPP motion to determine whether Defendant PSIC is entitled to an
award of attorneys’ fees. 
 
Defendant PSIC’s request to have its previously pending
anti-SLAPP motion put back on calendar is GRANTED. 
 
C.  
The Request for Dismissal Should Have Been
Entered with Prejudice  
 
Defendant PSIC contends that Plaintiff’s request for entry
of dismissal without prejudice was improper and such dismissal must be vacated
and a judgment of dismissal with prejudice must be entered instead. 
 
“The statutory term with prejudice clearly means the
plaintiff’s right of action is terminated and may not be revived.” (Boeken
v. Philip Morris USA, Inc. (2010) 48 Cal.4th 788, 793.) “[A] dismissal with
prejudice . . . bars any future action on the same subject matter.” (Ibid.)
On the other hand, “a voluntary dismissal without prejudice is not a
judgment on the merits, and, as such, has no claim-preclusive effect upon a
later suit.” (Gray v. La Salle Bank, N.A. (2023) 95 Cal.App.5th 932,
950.) “[A] plaintiff’s right to a voluntary dismissal is cut off no later than
the time of a ruling effectively disposing of the case . . . .” (Cole v.
Hammond (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 912, 923.) 
 
Here, the Court finds that a request for dismissal with
prejudice should have been entered. At the time of Plaintiff’s request for
dismissal as to Defendant PSIC, the District Court had already ordered
Plaintiff to dismiss this action with prejudice. (Lemeiux Decl., ¶ 7.)
Additionally, this Court already held in connection with the demurrer that all
of Plaintiff’s claims were barred by litigation privileges. (Lemeiux Decl., ¶
6.) It follows that, taken together, both rulings effectively disposed of the
instant action. An entry of dismissal without prejudice was therefore
appropriate. This Court has authority to enter a nunc pro tunc order to
correct clerical errors. (West Shield Investigations and Sec. Consultants v.
Superior Court (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 935, 950-51.) Thus, the Court corrects
the error of the court clerk and will enter a dismissal with prejudice of the
complaint as it concerns Defendant PSIC. 
 
The Court therefore VACATES the entry of dismissal without
prejudice nunc pro tunc and hereby enters an order dismissing the
complaint against Defendant PSIC with prejudice. 
 
The Court also notes that the motion is unopposed and “[a]
failure to oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to the granting of the
motion.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 8.54(c).) 
 
In sum, the motion is GRANTED in its entirety.
