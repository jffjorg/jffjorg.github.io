And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the plaintiff's allegations that the defendant failed to disclose certain facts, allegedly arising from their relationship and the defendant's exclusive knowledge or access to those facts. The plaintiff must specifically allege the content of the omitted facts, the defendant's awareness of their materiality, the inaccessibility of the facts to the plaintiff, and the point at which the omitted facts should have been revealed. The plaintiff must also show justifiable and actual reliance on the defendant's omission. Conclusory allegations that the defendant intentionally omitted the facts are insufficient. The court will review the case further before making a final ruling.
