And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for determination of good faith settlement filed by Cross-Defendant Wilbur Ernesto Flores Vizcarra without prejudice. The motion was brought to determine whether the settlement agreement between Cross-Defendant Vizcarra and Plaintiff Willie Sutton was entered into in good faith. The judge found that not all of the required factors were satisfied, including the lack of a rough approximation of Plaintiff's recovery and Cross-Defendant Vizcarra's proportionate share of liability. The judge also expressed doubts about whether the settlement amount of $15,000.00 was reasonable given the nature and extent of Plaintiff's injuries. As a result, the judge denied the motion without prejudice, allowing the parties to continue to litigate the issue.
