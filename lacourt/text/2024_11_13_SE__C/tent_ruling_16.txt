CASE NO.: 23NWCV03641

TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Defendants’ Demurrer to the First Amended Complaint is
OVERRULED.  The Motion to Strike is
DENIED.  Defendants to answer in 10
days.  
 
Plaintiff to give notice. 

 
Background
 
This is an employment law action. Plaintiff Mario Rodriguez
(“Plaintiff”) sued his former employers and supervisor, The Oncology Institute
CA, The Oncology Institute of Hope and Innovation Patient Safety Organization,
LLC, and Kassi Etensohn, on November 8, 2023. Plaintiff filed the operative First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on December 19, 2023, asserting causes of action for:
 
1. FEHA Harassment,
2. FEHA Discrimination,
3. FEHA Retaliation,
4. Failure to Prevent Discrimination, Harassment, or Retaliation, and
5.
Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy. 
 
Plaintiff alleges that he started working at the Oncology Institute on
January 5, 2022, as a pharmacy technician. (FAC, ¶ 10.) In April 2022, he
started working at the Institute’s San Diego location. (FAC, ¶ 11.) Plaintiff’s
supervisor, defendant Kassi Etensohn, sent him multiple messages using the
phrase “let’s taco about it”, which Plaintiff took to be a derogatory reference
to his Mexican heritage. (FAC, ¶ 12.) “Etensohn threatened Plaintiff with
physical assault if he reported his threats to management, and told him that “I
know where to find you,” if he got her fired.” (FAC, ¶ 12.) Plaintiff reported
these threats to his superiors. (FAC, ¶ 12.) He also complained that his threat
was not being taken seriously based on his gender, because he is male and
Etensohn female. (FAC, ¶ 13.) Plaintiff alleges Defendants retaliated against
him by transferring him to a location far from his home and unfairly
disciplining him when he struggled with the long commute. (FAC, ¶ 14.) Plaintiff
also spoke out against improper billing and distribution of pharmaceuticals by
his supervisor, Alicia Romero. (FAC, ¶ 15.) The Institute ultimately terminated
him. (FAC, ¶ 16.)
 
 
On January 22, 2024, defendants The Oncology Institute CA and The
Oncology Institute of Hope And Innovation Patient Safety Organization, LLC
(“Defendants”) demurred to and moved to strike portions of Plaintiff’s FAC. On
August 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed his opposition. On September 4, 2024,
Defendants replied.
 
On September 11, 2024, the parties appeared for hearing. The Court
continued the motion to this date for failure to meet and confer. Defendants’
counsel filed their meeting and conference declaration on October 30, 2024, and
the motion now comes before the Court a second time.
 
Meeting and Conference
 
“Before filing a demurrer ... , the demurring party shall meet and
confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is
subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be
reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a).) An equivalent requirement applies to motions to
strike. (Id., § 435.5.)
 
Upon continuance, Defendants’ counsel filed a declaration clarifying
that he met and conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel via Zoom in January 2024.
(Cai Decl., ¶ 5.) Sections 430.41 and 435.5 are satisfied.
 
Demurrer
 
Legal Standard
 
Where pleadings
are defective, a party may raise the defect by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v.
Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint alleges facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
(Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10; Young v. Gannon (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th
209, 220.) 
 
When considering a
demurrer, a court reads the allegations stated in the challenged pleading
liberally and in context, and “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material
facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact
or law.” (Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Put differently:
for purposes of demurrer, the court treats all facts alleged – but only the facts
alleged – in the complaint as true. (Picton v. Anderson Union High
School District (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 732.) “The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action.” (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)

Discussion
 
Defendants argue Plaintiff fails to state a claim because he does not
allege anything that “rise[s] to the level of conduct contemplated under FEHA
as being objectively unlawful harassment.” (Dem., 1:9-10.) They also claim he
fails to allege any discriminatory or retaliatory animus. (Id.,
1:12-23.) Finally, they allege his claim for Labor Code retaliation relies on a
“routine personnel management action”, not actionable according to case law.
 
Defendants’ arguments are all premature. It is not proper for the Court
to determine at the pleading stage what “rise[s] to the level” of actionable
conduct or what is a “routine … action”. These are subjective questions that
require further inquiry into the facts. In fact, not one of the California
cases Defendants cite in their memorandum was decided at the pleading stage;
most of Defendants’ own parenthetical descriptions of those decisions refer to
the sufficiency of evidence and to what must be “shown” at summary judgment or
trial.
 
Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to place Defendants on notice of
his claim, which is all he needs to do in his pleading.
 
As for retaliatory animus: Plaintiff has pled it. He pleads that
defendant Etensohn – a supervisor – made racist comments to him and threatened
to fire him if he spoke out. (¶ 12.) Plaintiff reported those claims to
management, so they were on notice of the discrimination. (¶ 13.) Afterward,
Plaintiff details concrete, specific adverse action taken against him. (¶ 14.)
The allegation of motive and causation is clear. If it is factually inaccurate,
Defendants may make such a challenge later in the proceedings.  
 
The demurrer is OVERRULED.  
 
Motion to Strike
 
Legal Standard
 
Motions to strike
are used to reach defects or objections to pleadings that are not challengeable
by demurrer, such as words, phrases, and prayers for damages. (See Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 435, 436, and 437.) The proper procedure to attack false allegations
in a pleading is a motion to strike. (Id. § 436 (a).) 
 
“The court may,
upon a motion made pursuant to Section 435 [notice of motion to strike whole or
part of complaint], or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems
proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in
any pleading.” (Id. § 436 (a).) Irrelevant matters include immaterial
allegations that are not essential to the claim or those not pertinent to or
supported by an otherwise sufficient claim. (Id., § 431.10.) The court
may also “[s]trike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the
court.” (Id. § 436 (b).)
 
Discussion
 
Defendants seek to strike Plaintiff’s references to and prayers for
punitive damages in his FAC.
 
A motion to strike is the proper procedure to attack a purportedly
improper remedy such as unjustified punitive damages. (Venice Town Council,
Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 1547, 1561-1562.) A
complaint including a request for punitive damages must also include
allegations showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such an award. (Clauson
v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.)
 
California Civil Code section 3294 authorizes the recovery of punitive
damages “[i]n an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from
contract, where … the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice
… .” (Civ. Code § 3294(a).) “‘Malice’ means conduct which is intended by the
defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is
carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the
rights or safety of others.” (Id. §
3294(c)(1).) “Oppression” means despicable conduct that subjects a person to
cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights. (Civ.
Code § 3294(c)(2).)
 
For a corporate defendant, the oppression, fraud or malice “must be on
the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation.”  (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (b).)  However, that requirement can be satisfied “
‘if the evidence permits a clear and convincing inference that within the
corporate hierarchy authorized persons acted despicably in “willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” ’  [Citation.]” 
(Morgan v. J-M Manufacturing Company, Inc. (2021) 60 Cal.App.5th
1078, 1090.) Punitive damages may also be imposed where an employer “ratified
the wrongful conduct for which … damages are awarded”. (Civ. Code, § 3294(b).)
 
Here, Plaintiff has stated facts – for pleading purposes – that allow
for the conclusion that Defendants are guilty of oppression. Oppression
requires no evil motive to inflict a specific harm; it requires only a
knowledge that the victim’s rights are being violated, and continuation of the
violative behavior. (Cf. Tomaselli v. Transamerica Ins. Co. (1994) 25
Cal.App.4th 1269, 1286-1287 [“[p]unitive damages are appropriate if the
defendant’s acts are … in blatant violation of law or policy”].) Accepted as true,
the facts show Defendants were on notice of the discriminatory and retaliatory
actions of its supervisors and permitted them to go on, and in fact inflicted
continuing punishment because Plaintiff asserted his legal rights. This is
sufficient for a finding of ratification, which is sufficient to impose
punitive damages.
 
The motion to strike is DENIED.
