The judge has made a tentative ruling to grant Attorney James V. Fazio's motion to be relieved as counsel for the defendants in the case. The motion is unopposed, and the judge finds good cause for withdrawal based on the client's failure to pay outstanding fees and costs as agreed upon in the engagement agreement. The judge notes that the attorney has filed the required documents, including a declaration stating the reasons for the motion and proof of service on the client and other parties. As a result, the motion is granted, and counsel is relieved of their duties.
