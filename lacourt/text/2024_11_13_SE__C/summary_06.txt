Here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to dismiss a complaint filed by plaintiff Maricarmen Mercado against defendants Global Paratransit, Inc. and others. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery requests. The court found that the plaintiff's failure to serve responses was not willful and that the plaintiff's disabilities, communication barriers, and logistical challenges excused at least a portion of the delay. As a result, the court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss. Additionally, the court advanced a motion to relieve counsel for the plaintiff from the hearing date of April 24, 2025 to the current date, and continued the motion to December 18, 2024. Finally, the court vacated a mandatory settlement conference scheduled for December 2, 2024.
