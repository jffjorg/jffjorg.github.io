Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
Defendants Global Paratransit, Inc., AYHS, Inc., All Yellow
Taxi, Inc. dba Metro Cab, and Froylan Guitierrez Santiago (collectively
Defendants) move to dismiss Plaintiff Maricarmen Mercado’s (Plaintiff) complaint
due to Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the court’s July 24, 2024 Order to provide
responses to Defendants’ discovery requests.
 
Procedural History
 
On April 12, 2023, Plaintiff sued Defendants for negligence,
alleging her arm was injured when Defendants’ ride share driver closed a taxi
car door on her arm on April 29, 2021. (Compl., p. 4.) 
 
On May 3, 2023, Defendants filed an answer. 
 
On July 28, 2023, Defendants served Plaintiff with Form
Interrogatories (Set One), Request for Production of Documents (Set One), and
Special Interrogatories (Set One). (Declaration of David H. Hillings [Hillings
Decl.], ¶ 6.) Plaintiff’s initial responses were due August 30, 2023. (Hillings
Decl., ¶ 7.) Plaintiff did not provide responses by the deadline. (Ibid.)
 
On November 28, 2023, Defendants filed motions to compel
responses to the discovery requests. On July 24, 2024, the court granted Defendants’
unopposed motions and ordered Plaintiff to serve responses within 20 days of
the issuance date, or August 13, 2024. The court also imposed sanctions in the
amount of $1180.00. (07/24/2024 – Minute Order.) Plaintiff did not serve
responses by the August 13, 2024 deadline.
 
Defendants filed the instant motion on September 11, 2024.
Plaintiff filed an opposition on October 28, 2024. Defendants filed a reply on
November 4, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
 
The court may impose terminating sanctions such as an “order
dismissing the action, or any part of the action,” if the court finds that a
party engages in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(3).) Misuses of the discovery process include “failing
to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery; making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to discovery; and disobeying a court order to provide
discovery.” (Dep’t. of Forestry & Fire Protection v. Howell (2017)
18 Cal.App.5th 154, 191, disapproved on other grounds by Presbyterian Camp
& Conference Ctrs., Inc. v. Superior Court (2021) 12 Cal.5th 493; see
also Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)
 
“However, terminating sanctions are to be used sparingly
because of the drastic effect of their application. [Citation]” (Ibid.) Courts
should tailor the selected sanction to “the harm caused by the misuse of the
discovery process and should not exceed what is required to protect the party
harmed by the misuse of the discovery process.” (Ibid.) Thus, “sanctions
are generally imposed in an incremental approach, with terminating sanctions
being the last resort.” (Ibid.) “[W]hen a plaintiff’s deliberate and egregious
misconduct makes any sanction other than dismissal inadequate to ensure a fair
trial, the trial court has inherent power to impose a terminating sanction.” (Slesinger,
Inc. v. Walt Disney Co. (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 736, 740.)
 
The prerequisites for imposing nonmonetary sanctions are:
(1) “a failure to comply with a court order”; and (2) “the failure must be
willful.” (Lee v. Lee (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1553, 1559.) 
 
Merits
 
Failure to comply with a court order – misuse of the
discovery process
 
Defendants argue Plaintiff engaged in misuse of the
discovery process by failing to comply with the court’s July 24, 2024 Order
ordering Plaintiff to serve responses to Defendants’ discovery requests within
20 days of the order’s issuance. (Motion to Dismiss, p. 6:5-18.) Defendants
note that neither Plaintiff nor her counsel appeared at the July 24th hearing
or opposed the motions to compel. (Id. at p. 6:8-12.) At that hearing, the
court ordered Plaintiff and her counsel to jointly pay monetary sanctions to
Defendants within 60 days of the court order. (Id. at p. 6:12-14.) As of
September 11, 2024, Plaintiff did not serve responses.
 
In opposition, Plaintiff states she has reasonably complied
with Defendants’ discovery requests by serving verified responses on Defendants
on September 25, 2024. (Opposition, p. 3:20-23, Exhs. A, B, C.) Plaintiff’s
counsel recently obtained Plaintiff’s authorization to obtain documents counsel
will provide to Defendants. (Opposition, p. 3:23-24.) Plaintiff cites Wantuch
v. Davis for the assertion that the court must balance the need for
compliance with discovery obligations against the broader policy of resolving
disputes on the merits, especially when a party’s disabilities impede
compliance. (Wantuch v. Davis (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 786, 795.)
 
Plaintiff states the delay was due to a combination of
extraordinary circumstances including “Plaintiff’s severe
physical disabilities, communication barriers, and logistical challenges in
reaching Plaintiff.” (Opposition, p. 2:6-7.) More specifically, Plaintiff
states she is “a disabled individual who is legally blind and suffers from an
injuries that causes her substantial pain. The injuries significantly limit her
ability to use public transportation, and she is unsteady on her feet. Due to
her condition, Plaintiff struggles with mobility and is unable to easily travel
to her attorney’s office. Moreover, Plaintiff lacks access to technology,
including the internet, which has made communication between her and her
counsel exceptionally difficult. Plaintiff also faces a language barrier, as
she speaks a language other than English, and this has necessitated the use of
translators to facilitate communication throughout the litigation process.”
(Opposition, p. 2:15-22.) Plaintiff also notes that on the day of the motion to
compel hearing, county-wide technical difficulties caused by a ransomware
attack prevented Plaintiff from appearing remotely. (Id. at p. 2:7-9.)
Finally, Plaintiff states her counsel has filed a motion to be relieved as
counsel which is set to be heard on April 24, 2025. (Id. at p. 2:9-10.)
 
In reply, Defendants state that Plaintiff’s counsel fails to
declare Plaintiff served responses and that even though the proofs of service
state the responses were served via email, Defendants never received them.
 
Willful Failure
 
Defendants argue Plaintiff’s failure to comply was willful and
that such willfulness is grounds for terminating sanctions under Civil
Procedure Code sections 2023.030, 2030.290, 2031.310, and 2031.320, which also
authorize monetary sanctions for failing to comply with court orders compelling
discovery responses. (Motion to Dismiss, pp. 6:27-28, 7:1-3.) Defendants also
note the court should award monetary sanctions under Civil Procedure Code section
177.5 which authorizes monetary sanctions for violation of court orders. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues her failure to attend the
hearing was caused by technical difficulties and her disabilities (her alleged
injuries and inability to speak English). (Opposition, p. 2:20-22.) Plaintiff
also cites John v. Pratt & Whitney Canada, Inc. (1994) 28
Cal.App.4th 613, 622, to support her contention that her failure to attend the
hearing was due to these extraordinary circumstances. 


Analysis
 
Of concern to the Court is the fact that none of the circumstances
relating to Plaintiff’s severe physical disabilities, communication barriers,
and the logistical challenges in reaching Plaintiff are contained within a
declaration and made under oath. 
However, Defendants do not dispute any of these contentions.   
 
Additionally, Defendants insist that they never received Plaintiff’s
discovery responses purportedly served on September 25, 2024. (Reply
Declaration of David M. Hillings, ¶¶ 9-10.) Defendants note that on May 30,
2023, they filed a “Consent to Electronic Service and Notice of Electronic
Service Address” with the court stating service was also to be made to Defendants’
counsel’s assistant at jlw@clintonlaw.com; and the proofs of service do not
indicate Plaintiff served her responses to this email address. (Id. at ¶
11.)  However, Plaintiff has included copies
of the discovery responses with the Opposition filed on October 28, 2024.
 
The Court finds that Defendants now have copies of Plaintiff’s
discovery responses, Plaintiff has not previously failed to comply with a court
order, and Plaintiff’s disability excuses at least a portion of the delay in
providing discovery responses.  Under the
circumstances here, the Court cannot find that terminating sanctions are warranted.  
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s
complaint is DENIED.  
 
On the Court’s own motion, Attorney
Michael Moghtader’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff is ADVANCED
from April 24, 2025 to today’s date and CONTINEUD to December 18, 2024 at 9:30
a.m. in Dept. SE-C.  Opposition and Reply
to be filed and served in compliance with the new hearing date.  
 
The Mandatory
Settlement Conference scheduled for December 2, 2024 is VACATED.
