```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants Defendant Penn-Star Insurance Company's motion to place the anti-SLAPP motion back on calendar and to vacate the entry of dismissal without prejudice. The court finds that the anti-SLAPP motion was improperly stayed and that the court must rule on the merits of the motion.

The court also finds that the request for dismissal without prejudice was improper and that a judgment of dismissal with prejudice should have been entered instead. The court notes that the Ninth Circuit had previously ruled that Plaintiff's claims were barred by litigation privileges, and that the court's previous demurrer and stay of the action were based on this finding.

The court grants the motion in its entirety and orders that the complaint be dismissed with prejudice as to Defendant Penn-Star Insurance Company.
