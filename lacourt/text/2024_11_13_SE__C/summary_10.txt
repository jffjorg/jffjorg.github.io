```

Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has sustained the Defendant's demurrer to the Plaintiff's fifth cause of action for fraudulent inducement, with 20 days leave to amend. The Judge has also granted the Defendant's motion to strike punitive damages from the First Amended Complaint (FAC) in part, with 20 days leave to amend. The Judge has denied the motion to strike punitive damages for the first, second, third, and fourth causes of action.

The Judge's ruling is based on the following findings:

* The FAC fails to state facts sufficient and specific enough to constitute a cause of action for fraudulent inducement.
* The FAC fails to allege a transactional relationship giving rise to a duty to disclose.
* The economic loss rule does not bar Plaintiffs' fraudulent inducement claim.

The Judge has also noted that the FAC sufficiently alleges breaches of warranty under the first, second, third, and fourth causes of action to support claims for Song-Beverly civil penalties. However, because the Judge sustained the Defendant's demurrer to the fraudulent inducement claim, Plaintiffs cannot pray for punitive damages on that cause of action.
