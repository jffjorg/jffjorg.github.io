Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Tiffany Packman v. Jennifer Jaye Fraser et al. The Judge has sustained Defendant Jennifer Jaye Fraser's demurrer to the complaint, finding that the complaint is ambiguous and fails to state a claim. The Judge has granted Plaintiff Tiffany Packman 30 days' leave to amend the complaint to cure its defects. The Judge notes that the complaint is uncertain and lacks specificity, making it difficult to determine when the claims accrued and whether they are timely. The Judge also notes that the complaint fails to plead the elements of fraud, breach of contract, and breach of fiduciary duty with sufficient clarity. The Judge has ordered the complaint dismissed with prejudice as to Defendant Fraser if Plaintiff fails to amend the complaint within the 30-day period.
