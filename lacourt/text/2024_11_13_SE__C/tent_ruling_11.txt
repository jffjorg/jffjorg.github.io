For example, if the
plaintiff alleges the defendant had a duty, independent of the parties’
contract, to disclose which “allegedly arose by virtue of the parties’
relationship and defendant’s exclusive knowledge or access to certain facts, .
. . the complaint must also include specific allegations establishing all the
required elements, including (1) the content of the omitted facts, (2)
defendant’s awareness of the materiality of those facts, (3) the
inaccessibility of the facts to plaintiff, (4) the general point at which
the omitted facts should or could have been revealed, and (5) justifiable and
actual reliance, either through action or forbearance, based on the defendant’s
omission.” (Rattagan, supra, 17 Cal.5th at pp. 43-44.) Conclusory
allegations that omissions were intentional with the purpose of defrauding or
deceiving a plaintiff are insufficient. (Rattagan, supra, 17
Cal.5th at p. 44 [citing Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 347.].)
