TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Defendant Wells International Marketing Group, Inc.’s
Demurrer is SUSTAINED with 10 days leave to amend.  
 
Moving party to give notice. 
 
This is an unlawful detainer action. On August 27, 2024,
Plaintiff Simin L.P. (“Plaintiff”) filed an unlawful detainer complaint against
Defendants Wells International Marketing Group, Inc. (“Defendant”) and DOES 1
to 50, which arises from the alleged nonpayment of rent. Plaintiff alleges that
the property at issue is located at 10006 Santa Fe Springs Road, Santa Fe
Springs, CA 90670 (the “Premises”), which Plaintiff alleges is a commercial
property. (Complaint, ¶¶ 3(a) and 7(a).) Plaintiff alleges that, on June 10,
2022, the parties entered into a three-year written lease whereby Defendant
agreed to rent pay rent in the amount of $130,193.36 per month. (Complaint, ¶
6(a)-(b).) 
 
On August 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a proof of service
showing that Defendant was served with the summons and complaint on August 30,
2024, by substituted service. (08/30/24 Minute Order.) 
 
On September 10, 2024, default was entered against
Defendant. 
 
On September 16, 2024, after hearing, the Court granted
Defendant’s ex parte application to vacate and set aside default.
(09/16/24 Minute Order.) The Court ordered the default set aside, and Defendant
was ordered to file an answer or responsive pleading within five days.
(09/16/24 Minute Order.)  
 
On September 23, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to quash
service of summons and complaint, which Plaintiff opposed.  
 
On October 10, 2024, after hearing, the Court denied
Defendant’s motion to quash. (10/10/24 Minute Order.) Defendant was ordered to
file an answer or responsive pleading within five days. (10/10/24 Minute
Order.) 
 
On October 15, 2024, Defendant filed and served the instant
demurrer to the complaint. The demurrer is made on the grounds “that the
[c]omplaint fails to allege facts sufficient to state any causes of actions
against . . . Defendant and the [c]omplaint is uncertain, ambiguous, and
unintelligible.” (Dem. at p. 2:3-5.) 
 
On October 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed an ex parte
application to advance the hearing on the demurrer and to set a trial date. Plaintiff’s
opposition to the demurrer was attached to the ex parte application. 
 
On October 23, 2024, after hearing, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s request to advance the hearing date on the demurrer, and the
hearing on the demurrer was advanced from August 6, 2025, and continued to
November 13, 2024. (10/23/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) The Court indicated that
Defendant’s reply brief was due no later than November 1, 2024. (10/23/24
Minute Order at p. 2.) The Court denied Plaintiff’s ex parte request to
set a trial date. (10/23/24 Minute Order at p. 2.) 
 
On November 1, 2024, Defendant filed and served its reply
brief. 
 
DEMURRER 
 
Meet and Confer 
 
In an unlawful detainer action, there is no requirement to
meet and confer prior to filing a demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(d)(2).) 
 
Legal Standard
 
“A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter
of law.”  (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare
(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives the complaint a
reasonable interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material
facts properly pleaded.”  (Ibid.)
“[A] demurrer accepts as true all well pleaded facts and those facts of which
the court can take judicial notice but not deductions, contentions, or
conclusions of law or fact.” (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185
Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) Although courts construe pleadings liberally,
sufficient facts must be alleged to support the allegations plead to survive a
demurrer. (Rakestraw v. California Physicians' Serv. (2000) 81
Cal.App.4th 39, 43.)  
 
In the unlawful detainer context, “[a] valid three-day pay
rent or quit notice is a prerequisite to an unlawful detainer action.” (Bevill
v. Zoura (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 694, 697.) “Because of the summary nature of
an unlawful detainer action, a notice is valid only if the lessor strictly
complies with the statutorily mandated notice requirements.” (Ibid.) “[A]
commercial landlord who invokes the summary procedures of unlawful detainer
must strictly comply with the notice requirements of the statute under which
he/she elects to proceed.” (WDT-Winchester v. Nilsson (1994) 27
Cal.App.4th 516, 526.) “A judgment must be reversed when it is based on a
three-day notice which lacks the information required by Code of Civil
Procedure section 1161, subdivision (2).” (Foster v. Williams (2014) 229
Cal.App.4th Supp. 9, 14 (Foster).) 
 
Under Code Civ. Proc., § 1161(2), a tenant is guilty of
unlawful detainer:
 
“When the tenant continues in possession, in person or by
subtenant, without the permission of the landlord, or the successor in estate
of the landlord, if applicable, after default in the payment of rent, pursuant
to the lease or agreement under which the property is held, and three days’
notice, excluding Saturdays and Sundays and other judicial holidays, in
writing, requiring its payment, stating the amount that is due, the name,
telephone number, and address of the person to whom the rent payment shall be
made, and, if payment may be made personally, the usual days and hours that
person will be available to receive the payment . . . .” 
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1161(2).) 
 
Where a commercial tenancy is concerned, “the amount stated
in the notice provided to the tenant pursuant to subdivision (2) of Section
1161” may be identified as an estimate. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1161.1, subd. (a).)
However, if such estimated “amount claimed is not in fact correct, but it is
determined upon the trial or other judicial determination that rent was owing,
and the amount claimed in the notice was reasonably estimated, the tenant shall
be subject to judgment for possession and the actual amount of rent and other
sums found to be due.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1161.1, subd. (a).) “Commercial real
property . . . means all real property in this state except dwelling units . .
. or recreational vehicles.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1161.1, subd. (d).) 
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be
allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman
v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to
show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.) “If
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman
v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).  
 
Analysis
 
A.  
Sufficiency of the Three-Day Notice to Pay or
Quit
 
Parties’ Positions 
 
Defendant contends that the “Three (3) Business Day Notice
To Pay Rent Or Surrender Possession of the Premises” (the “Notice”), which is
attached as Exhibit 2 to the complaint, is defective. Defendant contends that
the Notice: (1) fails to state a person to whom payment should be made; (2)
fails to state how the payment should be made; (3) fails to state the past due
rent amount; and (4) lacks the required information regarding Defendant’s deadline
to pay and its expiration. 
 
In opposition to the demurrer, Plaintiff contends that: (1)
the Notice adequately identifies the person to whom the rent payment was to be
made; (2) the Notice was not required to specify a method of payment; (3) the
Notice adequately states the past due rent amount; and (4) the Notice contains
the required payment deadline. 
 
On reply, Defendant argues that the Notice is defective, and
that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for unlawful detainer. 
 
Language of the Notice 
 
The Court finds it necessary to set forth the pertinent
language of the Notice. (Complaint, Ex. 2.) The Notice is directed to Defendant
and defines “Landlord” as Plaintiff. (Complaint, Ex. 2 at pp. 1-2.) The Notice
states that “You are hereby notified that pursuant to the Standard
Industrial/Commercial Multi-Tenant Lease—Gross dated June 10, 2022 (the
“Lease”), under which you hold possession of the premises described s 10006
Santa Fe Springs Road, Santa Fe Springs, CA 90670 (“Premises”), there is now due,
unpaid and delinquent rent in the estimated total sum of $276,244.26 . .
. .” (Complaint, Ex. 2 at p. 1, emphasis in original.)  
 
The Notice further states:
 
“You are further notified that within three (3) business
days after service of this Notice on you, you must pay the amount of said
estimated rent in full by delivering said amount to Landlord, between the hours
of 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Monday through Friday (except for holidays) at 10018
Santa Fe Springs Road, Santa Fe Springs, CA 90670, telephone number (562)
903-9550, or quit the Premises and deliver up possession of the Premises to
Landlord, Landlord’s authorized agent, or the undersigned, who are authorized
to receive possession of the same, or legal proceedings will be instituted for
unlawful detainer against you to recover possession of the Premises, to declare
said Lease forfeited, and to recover actual and statutory rents and damages.” 
 
(Complaint, Ex. 2 at p. 1.) 
 
Defendant was notified that “by [the] Notice, Landlord
elects to and does hereby declare a forfeiture of said Lease if said estimated
rent is not paid in full within the said three (3) business days.” (Complaint,
Ex. 2 at p. 1.) 
 
The Notice Sufficiently Articulates to Whom Payment
Should be Made 
 
Initially, the Court finds that Defendant’s reliance on Foster,
supra, 229 Cal.App.4th Supp. 9 is inapposite. In Foster, the
issue was whether a three-day notice to pay rent or quit was insufficient where
the notice lacked a physical address to where the person to whom rent should be
paid could be found. (Foster, supra, 229 Cal.App.4th Supp. 9,
15-16.) The Foster court held that the notice was insufficient under CCP
§ 1161(2) because it did not set forth “the physical place where defendant
could pay the rent to avoid an unlawful detainer.” (Foster, supra,
229 Cal.App.4th Supp. 9, 16.) 
 
Here, however, the Notice clearly indicates that “Landlord”
is Plaintiff Simin LP, and that payment should be delivered to Plaintiff.
(Complaint, Ex. 2 at pp. 1-2.) Moreover, the word “person as used in section
1161(2) includes a corporation as well as a natural person.” (City of
Alameda v. Sheehan (2024) 325 Cal.Rptr.3d 438, 447.) “[A] three-day notice
may comply with section 1161(2) if it names a corporation or entity” and the
name of such corporation or entity is correct and complete. (Ibid.)
Thus, the Court finds that the Notice sufficiently informs Defendant to whom
payment should be made. 
 
The Court therefore rejects Defendant’s argument that the
Notice does not state a person to whom payment should be made. 
 
The Notice States How Payment Should Be Made
 
The Court rejects Defendant’s argument that the Notice is
deficient because it does not specify whether payment should be made in person,
by mail, or by bank deposit. (Demurrer at p. 7:1-3.)  The Notice instructed Defendant to personally
deliver the alleged delinquent rent personally and set forth the address, days
and hours of operation, telephone number, and identity of the entity to whom
the rent should be delivered. Given that Plaintiff only allowed personal delivery
of the delinquent rent, Plaintiff was not required to specify a form of payment
pursuant to CCP § 1161(2). CCP § 1161(2) does not require a notice to specify a
form of payment—i.e, cash, check, money order, etc.—where personal delivery is
the means chosen to cure delinquent rent pursuant to a three-day notice to pay
rent or quit. (Hsieh v. Pederson (2018) 23 Cal.App.5th Supp. 1, 6.) 
 
 
 
The Notice Sufficiently States the Past Due Rent Amount
 
The Court rejects Defendant’s argument that the Notice fails
to state a past due rent amount. There is no dispute that the tenancy at issue
in this action is a commercial tenancy. Defendant’s reliance on Johnson v.
Sanches (1942) is inapposite because such case concerned a notice to pay
rent or quit which stated a monetary amount in excess of the amount then due. (Johnson
v. Sanches (1942) 56 Cal.App.2d 115, 118.) Moreover, where a commercial
tenancy is concerned, estimates of rent owed are proper. (Levitz Furniture
Co. v. Wingtip Communications, Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1035, 1042.) Here,
the Notice informs Defendant that the estimated total past due rent amount is
$276,244.26, which is for the period of July 1, 2024 through August 31, 2024.
(Complaint, Ex. 2 at p. 1.)
 
Therefore, the Court finds that the Notice sufficiently
states the past due rent amount that is owed to Plaintiff. 
 
The Notice Sufficiently Informs Defendant of the Required
Deadline to Pay and its Expiration 
 
The Court rejects Defendant’s contention that the Notice
fails because it did not inform Defendant that it “had to make a payment within
three days, excluding Saturdays and Sundays and other judicial holidays.”
(Demurrer at p. 8:18-20.) 
 
The Court finds that CCP § 1161(2) does not require
Plaintiff to insert verbatim language that payment must be made within three
days “excluding Saturdays and Sundays and other judicial holidays.” Defendant
cites no legal authority to support such a proposition. Here, the Notice
clearly informed Defendant that the amount of estimated rent was due within
three business days of service of the Notice, and that such amount could only
be paid on Monday through Friday, except for holidays. (Complaint, Ex. 2. at p.
1.)  
 
As such, the Court finds that the Notice sufficiently
informs Defendant of the required payment deadline and its expiration. 
 
In sum, the Court finds that the Notice is not defective on
its face. 
 
B.  
Service of the Notice 

 
Defendant asserts that the complaint fails to state a cause
of action for unlawful detainer because it does not allege service of the
Notice pursuant to the written agreement between the parties. Plaintiff argues
that the Notice was served properly. 
 
CCP § 1162 allows for service of notices to pay or quit
“upon a commercial tenant by any of the following methods: 
 
(1) By delivering a copy to the tenant personally.
 
(2) If he or she is absent from the commercial rental
property, by leaving a copy with some person of suitable age and discretion at
the property, and sending a copy through the mail addressed to the tenant at
the address where the property is situated. 
 
(3) If, at the time of attempted service, a person of
suitable age or discretion is not found at the rental property through the
exercise of reasonable diligence, then by affixing a copy in a conspicuous
place on the property, and also sending a copy through the mail addressed to
the tenant at the address where the property is situated. Service upon a
subtenant may be made in the same manner.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1162, subd. (b)(1)-(3).) 
 
In commercial tenancies, parties can “lawfully agree to
notice requirements different from . . . those contained in [the Code of Civil
Procedure] because the lease was commercial rather than residential.” (Folberg
v. Clara G.R. Kinney Co. (1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 136, 140.) 
 
Here, the complaint alleges that the Notice was served on
Defendant on August 20, 2024, by posting a copy of the Premises. (Complaint, ¶¶
9(a), 10(a)(3).) Plaintiff alleges that the Notice was served in the manner
specified in the lease. (Complaint, ¶ 10(a)(5).) 
 
The Court has reviewed the lease agreement, which is
attached as Exhibit 1 to the complaint.[1]
The lease agreement provides that “[a]ll notices required or permitted by this
[l]ease or applicable law shall be in writing and may be delivered in person
(by hand or by courier) or may be sent by overnight delivery service
guaranteeing next day delivery, with postage prepaid, and shall be deemed
sufficiently given if served in a manner specified in this Paragraph 23.”
(Complaint, Ex. 1 at ¶ 23.1.) 
 
The Court finds that the lease agreement does not allow
service of notices by merely posting a notice at the Premises. Plaintiff’s
contention that the complaint alleges posting of the Notice and mailing of the
Notice to Defendant thereafter is inaccurate. (Opp’n at p. 9: 6-9.) There is no
proof of service attached to the Notice. Plaintiff’s attempt to introduce the
declaration of Mark J. Austin and an attached proof of service concerning
mailing of the Notice to Defendant is improper on demurrer. (Austin Decl., ¶ 6;
Ex. 4.) “The demurrer tests the pleading alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters which do not appear on the face of the pleading or cannot be
properly inferred from the factual allegations of the complaint.” (Executive
Landscape Corp. v. San Vicente Country Villas IV Assn. (1983) 145
Cal.App.3d 496, 499.) Moreover, Plaintiff’s citations to Folberg v. Clara
G.R. Kinney Co. (1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 136 and 
Culver Center Partners East #1, L.P. v. Baja Fresh
Westlake Village, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 744 are both inapposite to
support the contention that service was proper. 
 
Given that Plaintiff failed to allege proper service of the
Notice in accordance with either the terms of the lease or CCP § 1162(b)(3),
the Court finds that the complaint is defective. 
 
The Court therefore SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer to the
complaint. 
 
C.  
The Premature Filing of the Complaint
 
Defendant contends that the complaint was filed prematurely
because Plaintiff failed to allege proper service of the Notice. Plaintiff
argues that the action was timely filed. 
 
The Court rejects Defendant’s argument that the complaint
was filed prematurely. Plaintiff alleges that it served Defendant with the
Notice on August 20, 2024, and that the Notice expired on August 23, 2024.
(Complaint, ¶¶ 9(a), 9(b)(1).) The complaint was filed on August 27, 2024,
which is after the Notice expired. 
 
Therefore, the Court finds that the complaint was not
prematurely filed. 
 
D.  
Uncertainty 
 
In its final argument in support of the demurrer, Defendant
argues that the complaint is uncertain. 
 
The Court does not find that the complaint is uncertain
because it sufficiently apprizes Defendant of the issues that must be met. (Bacon
v. Wahrhaftig (1950) 97 Cal.App.2d 599, 605.) Thus, the Court OVERRULES the
demurrer of Defendant on the grounds of uncertainty. 
 
E.  
Leave to Amend 
 
Plaintiff was required to “allege . . . proper service of
the requisite notice.” (Liebovich v. Shahrokhany (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th
511, 513.) The Court finds that there exists a reasonable possibility of
successful amendment. 
 
Defendant’s demurrer to the complaint is SUSTAINED with 10
days leave to amend.
