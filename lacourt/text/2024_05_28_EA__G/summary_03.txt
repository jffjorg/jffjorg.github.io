And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling continues the demurrer hearing to a later date. The court finds that the parties did not adequately meet and confer before filing the demurrer. According to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, the demurring party must meet and confer with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer. The court finds that PHH's counsel did not adequately state how the parties met and conferred. Therefore, the demurrer is continued to allow the parties to further meet and confer. The court also orders PHH's counsel to file a supplemental declaration describing the meet and confer efforts at least nine court days before the next scheduled hearing.
