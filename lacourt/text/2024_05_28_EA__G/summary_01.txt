And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants Tesla's motion to compel arbitration. The plaintiff, Michael Soliman, purchased a certified pre-owned 2015 Tesla Model S 85 in February 2019. Soliman alleges that the vehicle presented with serious defects in its electrical and body systems. Tesla filed a motion to compel arbitration, which the court has granted. The court finds that the arbitration provision in the Motor Vehicle Order Agreement is enforceable and that Soliman failed to opt out of the arbitration provision. The court also finds that the arbitration provision is not unconscionable. Therefore, the court grants Tesla's motion to compel arbitration and stays the action pending completion of binding arbitration between the parties.
