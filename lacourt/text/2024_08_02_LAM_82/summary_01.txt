And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Petitioner Lionel C. Williams' motion to set aside the previous order. Petitioner did not appear at the hearing on April 17, 2024, and claims that this was due to a diabetic emergency. However, the Court finds that Petitioner has not provided sufficient evidence to support this claim, and even if accepted, there is no basis to grant the motion. The Court had already decided the petition on the merits after considering Petitioner's briefs and the administrative record, and denied the petition finding that Petitioner was not entitled to unemployment insurance. The Court also finds that the requested relief would be futile, as the Court would be required to enter the same order following a hearing. Therefore, the Court orders that Petitioner's motion is denied.
