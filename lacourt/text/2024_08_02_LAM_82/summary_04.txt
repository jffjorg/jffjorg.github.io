And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a petition under Section 1094.5 of the Unemployment Insurance Code. The petitioner failed to provide the administrative record, and instead, the court received a courtesy copy from the respondent's counsel. The judge notes that in such proceedings, it is the petitioner's responsibility to produce a sufficient record of the administrative proceedings. As a result, the "presumption of regularity" prevails, and the court decides the petition on the merits without considering the disputed issues.
