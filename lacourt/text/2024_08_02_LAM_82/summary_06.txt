```
Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court denies the plaintiff's application for writs of possession, without prejudice, against both defendants. The court finds that the plaintiff has not established probable cause to believe that the vehicle is located at the specified location, and therefore, the application is denied. The court also denies the plaintiff's request for a turnover order, as it is not entitled to a writ of possession against the defendant ACE.
