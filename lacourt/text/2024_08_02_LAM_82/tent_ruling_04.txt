Petitioner did not lodge the administrative record.  “In a section 1094.5 proceeding, it is the
responsibility of the petitioner to produce a sufficient record of the
administrative proceedings.”  (Elizabeth D. v. Zolin (1993) 21
Cal.App.4th 347, 354.)  Otherwise, the
“presumption of regularity” will prevail. 
(Ibid.; see also Eureka
Citizens for Responsible Government v. City of Eureka (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 357, 366 [“Failure to provide an adequate record concerning an
issue challenged on appeal requires that the issue be resolved against the
appellants.”])  The court received a
courtesy copy from Respondent’s counsel and decides the petition on the
merits.
