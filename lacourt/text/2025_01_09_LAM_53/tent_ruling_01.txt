  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion for issue, evidentiary,

MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D.,
Inc.        
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant Yang Lu
Motion for Issue, Evidentiary, Monetary, and Terminating Sanctions
The court
considered the moving and reply papers filed in connection with this motion. 
            The
court has considered only the first 15 pages of the 21-page opposition
papers.  (Def. Opp., pp. 2-22; Cal. Rules
of Ct., rule 3.1113, subd. (d) [“Except in a summary judgment or summary
adjudication motion, no opening or responding memorandum may exceed 15
pages”].) 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc. (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an
order imposing issue, evidence, monetary, and terminating sanctions against
defendant Yang Lu (“Defendant”) on the ground that Defendant failed to fully
comply with the court’s September 13, 2024 order. 
If a party engages in a misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose monetary, issue, evidence, or terminating sanctions.¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.030.)¿ “Misuses of the discovery process include, but are not limited
to, the following: [¶¶] (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized
method of discovery. [¶¶] (g) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d),
(g).)  “When exercising its discretion to
determine which form of sanction is most appropriate for a discovery violation,
a trial court should consider various factors, including ‘the importance of the
materials that were not produced—from the perspective of the offended party’s
ability to litigate the case—and what prejudice, if any, the offended party
suffered….’”  (Victor Valley Union
High School District v. Superior Court of San Bernardino County (2023) 91
Cal.App.5th 1121, 1158.)  
On September 13, 2024, the court issued an order (1) granting
Plaintiff’s motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to its Special
Interrogatories, Set 11, and (2) ordering Defendant (i) to serve further, full
and complete answers to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set 11, numbers
138-142, within 20 days of the date of the court’s order, and (ii) to pay
monetary sanctions to Plaintiff in the amount of $1,549.15, within 30 days of
the date of the court’s order.  (Sep. 13,
2024 Order, pp. 2:23-3:2.) 
Plaintiff has submitted evidence showing that Defendant did not serve
a full and complete answer to special interrogatory number 140.  Specifically, although that interrogatory
requested that Defendant “[s]tate the date and time that [she] first sent [her]
son Duan to Defendant Bowen Duan’s custody after Duan’s procedure[,]” Defendant
only stated the date on which she sent her son to defendant Bowen Duan’s residence.  (Chan Decl., Ex. E, p. 2:14-19.)  Thus, Defendant’s response was incomplete
since it did not state the time at which she sent Duan to defendant Bowen
Duan’s residence.  (Ibid.)  In support of her opposition to Plaintiff’s
motion, Defendant has submitted evidence showing that, on December 16, 2024,
she served a further supplemental response on Plaintiff, in which she states
both the date and time on which she sent her son to defendant Bowen Duan’s residence.  (Nolet Decl., Ex. C, pp. 2:11-13 [further
supplemental response], 4 [proof of service].)  Plaintiff does not appear to contest service
of the further supplemental response. 
(Reply, p. 3:10-12.) 
First, the court denies Plaintiff’s request for terminating sanctions
because (1) Defendant substantially complied with the court’s September 13,
2024 order by (i) serving further answers to Special Interrogatories, Set 11,
numbers 138-139 and 141-142, with which Plaintiff does not appear to take
issue, and (ii) serving a partial response to number 140, and (2) Defendant
has, in opposition to this motion, submitted evidence establishing that
Defendant has since served a full and complete answer to interrogatory number
140.  (Chan Decl., Ex. E, pp. 2:1-13,
2:20-3:7; Nolet Decl., Ex. C, p. 2:11-13; Victor Valley Union High School
District, supra, 91 Cal.App.5th at p. 1158.)  Thus, the court finds that terminating
sanctions are unwarranted and inappropriate.
Second, the court denies Plaintiff’s request for an issue sanction
that “prohibit[s] Defendant Lu from supporting or opposing any claim or defense
with the allegation that she took her son to Bowen Duan’s house (aka Jiayin
Huang’s residence), or that Defendants Duan and/or Huang are witnesses to the
child’s condition[,]” because (1) Defendant has shown that she has fully
complied with the court’s September 13, 2024 order by serving a further, full
and complete supplemental response on December 16, 2024, such that issue
sanctions are not warranted, appropriate, or necessary to protect the interests
of Plaintiff, and (2) even if Defendant had not supplemented her response to
state the time at which she took her son to defendant Bowen Duan’s residence,
Plaintiff’s proposed issue sanction is not “tailor[ed]” “to the harm caused by
the withheld discovery[,]” which consists only of the omission of the time (and
not the date) on which she took her son to his residence.  (Notice of Mot., p. 1:14-17; Nolet Decl., Ex.
C, p. 2:11-13; Victor Valley Union High School District, supra,
91 Cal.App.5th at p. 1158 [internal quotation marks and citations omitted].) 
Third, the court denies Plaintiff’s request for an evidence sanction
to “preclud[e] [Defendant][1]
from introducing any evidence, testimony, or documents of any kind at the time
of trial, regarding bringing her son to Bowen Duan and Jiayin Huang’s
residence, and to prelude Defendant Lu from utilizing co-Defendants Duan and
Huang as witnesses to support Defendant Lu’s alleged claims or defenses[,]”
because (1) Defendant has shown that she has fully complied with the court’s
September 13, 2024 order by serving a further, full and complete supplemental
response on December 16, 2024, such that evidence sanctions are not necessary
to protect the interests of Plaintiff, and (2) even if Defendant had not
supplemented her response to state the time at which she took her son to
defendant Bowen Duan’s residence, Plaintiff’s proposed evidence sanction is not
“tailor[ed]” “to the harm caused by the withheld discovery[,]” which consists
only of the omission of the time (and not the date) on which she took her son
to his residence.  (Notice of Mot., p.
1:18-22; Nolet Decl., Ex. C, p. 2:11-13; Victor Valley Union High School
District, supra, 91 Cal.App.5th at p. 1158 [internal quotation marks
and citations omitted].) 
Fourth, the court finds, after considering the papers filed in
connection with this motion and Defendant’s initial substantial compliance with
the court’s September 13, 2024 order, that the circumstances presented would
make the imposition of monetary sanctions unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)  The court therefore denies
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $5,841.65 against
Defendant.  (Ibid.)
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Seran Ng,
D.M.D., Inc.’s motion for issue, evidentiary, monetary, and terminating
sanctions.
            The court orders defendant Yang Lu
to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
