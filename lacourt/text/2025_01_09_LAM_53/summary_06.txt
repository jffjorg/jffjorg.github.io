And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on the defendant's motion to January 9, 2025, or a later date as convenient for the court. The judge notes that the arbitration agreement provides for a neutral arbitrator, discovery, and a detailed written decision and award, and that the parties have the right to recover all relief available under applicable law. The judge also notes that the arbitration agreement does not explicitly incorporate the procedural provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), and therefore the default procedural provisions of the California Arbitration Act apply. The judge plans to apply the substantive law of California in resolving the dispute.
