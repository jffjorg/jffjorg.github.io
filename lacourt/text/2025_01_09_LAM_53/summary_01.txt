And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Seran Ng, D.M.D., Inc.'s motion for issue, evidentiary, monetary, and terminating sanctions against Defendant Yang Lu. The motion was brought because Defendant failed to fully comply with the court's September 13, 2024 order to provide a full and complete answer to special interrogatory number 140. However, the judge found that Defendant substantially complied with the order by providing a further supplemental response on December 16, 2024, which included the time at which she sent her son to defendant Bowen Duan's residence. As a result, the judge denied Plaintiff's request for terminating sanctions, issue sanctions, evidence sanctions, and monetary sanctions. The judge found that the circumstances of the case did not warrant the imposition of monetary sanctions.
