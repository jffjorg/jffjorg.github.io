[1] On
October 11, 2024, the parties lodged a joint stipulation to continue the
hearing on Defendant’s motion to December 13, 2024, or any date thereafter
convenient to the court.  (Oct. 17, 2024
Joint Stip., p. 3:1-3.)  On October 17,
2024, the court entered an order on the stipulation and continued the hearing
on Defendant’s motion to January 9, 2025. 
(Oct. 17, 2024 Joint Stip., p. 4 [Order].) 


[2] The
court notes that the arbitration agreement states that it “shall be governed by
and interpreted in accordance with the FAA[,]” but that “[w]here the FAA is
silent, or where, by operation of law, the FAA does not apply, the substantive
law of California shall apply.”  (Long Decl.,
Ex. B, p. 1.)  Defendant did not argue
that this provision shows that the parties incorporated the procedural
provisions of the FAA over the default procedural provisions of the California
Arbitration Act.  (Victrola 89, LLC v.
Jaman Properties 8 LLC (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 337, 345 [“‘[T]he FAA’s procedural
provisions . . . do not apply unless the contract contains a choice-of-law
clause expressly incorporating them’”] [emphasis in original]; Valencia v.
Smyth (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 153, 178 [“interpreting an arbitration agreement
in accordance with the FAA does not accomplish the . . . goal of displacing
section 1281.2(c)”] [emphasis in original].) 


[3] The
court notes, as Defendant asserts in its moving papers, that the Arbitration
Agreement (1) provides for a neutral arbitrator, (2) provides that the parties
shall have the right to conduct discovery pursuant to the Civil Discovery Act,
(3) requires the arbitrator to issue “a detailed written decision and award,”
(4) provides for the recovery of “any and all relief, legal and equitable,
appropriate under applicable law,” such that it provides for all types of
relief that would otherwise be available in court, and (5) requires the
employer to “pay the arbitrator’s fee for the proceeding, as well as any room
or other charges by JAMS, or other mediation service mutually agreed to by the
Parties.”  (Long Decl., Ex. B, Arbitration
Agreement, p. 1; Beco, supra, 86 Cal.App.5th at p. 310
[“compulsory arbitration of FEHA claims is not per se unconscionable so long as
the arbitration agreement” satisfies the five requirements set forth in Armendariz
v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 102].)
