[2] The
court notes that it appears that the court in the Second Unlawful Detainer
Action might have sustained Plaintiff’s demurrer on the ground that the notice
was defective since it did not identify a natural person.  (Arnold Decl., Ex. S [stating that “[t]his is
similar to the situation presented in Boy Scouts of America National Foundation
v. Superior Court (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 428[,]” in which that court concluded
that the Legislature “included the language ‘any person’ and ‘any person or
entity in separate subdivisions of CCP § 340.1(a) meant that the legislature
intended for some of these subdivisions to apply only to natural persons[,]”
such that the Legislature intended section Code of Civil Procedure section 1161
to indicate that a notice must identify a natural person].)  However, other cases have held that a
“‘person’ as used in section 1161(2) incudes a corporation as well as a natural
person . . . .”  (City of Alameda v.
Sheehan (2024) 105 Cal.App.5th 68, 80.)
