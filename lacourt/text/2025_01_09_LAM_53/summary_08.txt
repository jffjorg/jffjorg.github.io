And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering the second unlawful detainer action, where the plaintiff's demurrer was sustained due to a defective notice that did not identify a natural person. The court notes that this is similar to the situation in Boy Scouts of America National Foundation v. Superior Court (2012), where the court concluded that the Legislature intended for some subdivisions of CCP § 340.1(a) to apply only to natural persons. However, the court also references City of Alameda v. Sheehan (2024), which held that "person" as used in section 1161(2) includes a corporation as well as a natural person. The court is considering the correct interpretation of "person" in CCP § 340.1(a) and will make a final ruling at the next hearing.
