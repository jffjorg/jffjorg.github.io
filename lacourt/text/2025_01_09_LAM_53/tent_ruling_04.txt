The court notes that, on December 2, 2024, Counsel filed a document entitled
“Notice of Continued Hearings.”  (Dec. 2,
2024 Notice.)  However, that notice informed
counsel for plaintiff Carlos Duarte only of the continuance of the trial and
final status conference.  (Dec. 2, 2024
Notice, p. 1:18-21 [continuance of trial], 1:22-25 [continuance of final status
conference].)  The notice (1) did not
state the continued hearing date on the pending motions to be relieved as
counsel, and (2) was not served on Diversified Staffing.  (Ibid.; Id. at pp. 3-4 [proof
of service].)
