Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for an order requiring the plaintiff to post an undertaking in the amount of $48,794.70. The plaintiff, Domenica Azzolini, is an out-of-state resident and has not provided sufficient evidence of her indigency. The defendant, Agenor Mafra-Neto, has argued that the plaintiff is not indigent and that she has the means to post the undertaking. The judge has determined that the plaintiff has made a prima facie showing of indigency and that she is unlikely to obtain the necessary bond due to her financial situation. Therefore, the judge has denied the defendant's motion and has ordered the defendant to give notice.
