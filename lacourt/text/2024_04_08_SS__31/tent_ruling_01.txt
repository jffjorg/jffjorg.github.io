The complaint alleges that on April 30, 2018, Plaintiff sustained injury while walking on a driveway near Serrano and 6th Street in Los Angeles because of an unsafe condition. Plaintiff sets forth a cause of action for premises liability against defendants City of Los Angeles and Colonnade Wilshire Corporation (“Colonnade”).    On December 20, 2021, an Order of Dismissal was entered as to Colonnade, because Plaintiff failed to file proof of service.   The Court previously denied Plaintiff’s request to set aside the dismissal of Colonnade on June 7, 2023. On January 23, 2024, the same request was denied with prejudice, for reasons set forth in that ruling. In other words, the denial with prejudice means that the ruling was final, and the issue is not subject to further inquiry. It appears that Plaintiff seeks once more to set aside Colonnade’s dismissal on the instant motion, which the Court will not consider.  This action is now over 5 years old, with trial to commence on April 15, 2024. Plaintiff must prepare accordingly.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.    PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 5th day of April 2024      Hon.
