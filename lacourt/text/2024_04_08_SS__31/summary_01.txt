Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motion to set aside the dismissal of Colonnade Wilshire Corporation, which was previously denied. The plaintiff, Mary Lim, seeks to set aside the dismissal, but the court will not consider this request. The case is now over 5 years old, and the trial is scheduled to commence on April 15, 2024. The plaintiff must prepare accordingly. The court encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court. If the parties neither submit nor appear at the hearing, the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
