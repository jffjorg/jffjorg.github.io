And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition and pay monetary sanctions. The defendant failed to submit a meet and confer declaration, which is required by California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 2025.450(b)(2). The defendant unilaterally set deposition dates without contacting the plaintiff, and there is no evidence that the defendant attempted to reach out to the plaintiff outside of serving multiple deposition notices and taking certificates of non-appearances. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning the defendant can re-file the motion with the required meet and confer declaration.
