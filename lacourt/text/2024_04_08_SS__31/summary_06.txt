And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively denied the petition to approve the compromise of pending action of a minor, citing several defects in the petition. The petition lacks an attorney declaration, and the petitioner did not specify where to deliver the net balance of $27,654.00. Additionally, the petitioner did not properly complete the settlement terms. The judge orders the petitioner to file a new petition curing these defects and to provide the requisite information. The petitioner must also give notice of the ruling.
