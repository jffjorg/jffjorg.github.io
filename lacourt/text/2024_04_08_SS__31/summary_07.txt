And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is about a motion to compel further responses to a request for production of documents (RPDs) in a personal injury case. The plaintiff, Martha Maldonado Luna, is seeking to compel the defendant, Baraat Moller, to produce his medical records related to the motor vehicle accident. The defendant is opposing the motion, arguing that the patient-physician privilege prevents disclosure of his medical records. The court finds that the defendant did raise the issue of his own medical condition by asserting that the accident did not cause the plaintiff's alleged injuries. Therefore, the court grants the plaintiff's motion in part, ordering the defendant to produce his medical records related to his first visit to the emergency room at Martin Luther King.
