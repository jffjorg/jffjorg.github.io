Plaintiffs 3800 West Sixth Street, LLC and Leo Lee


 MOTIONDefendant Steven
C. Kim (“Defendant”) moves to compel Plaintiffs 3800 West Sixth Street, LLC and
Leo Lee (“Plaintiffs”) to produce responsive documents to Defendant’s Requests
for Production of Documents, Nos. 3, 29, 30, 35-45, and 54-74 (“RPD”).  Plaintiffs oppose the motion.  ANALYSISUnder Code of
Civil Procedure section 2031.320, the court may compel a party to comply with
its agreement to comply with a request for production of documents.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (a).)  In its December 13, 2023 order, the court
ordered Plaintiffs to produce all documents in response to the RPD.  (See December 13, 2023 Minute Order.)  As such, the court has already entered the
order Defendant seeks.  Defendant cites
no authority for the proposition once again the court should compel Plaintiffs
to comply with its December 13, 2023 order. 
Rather, under the circumstances, Defendant’s remedy is to seek an issue,
evidence, or monetary sanction.  (See
Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (c).)  The
court, therefore, denies Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiffs to produce
responsive documents as moot.  In opposition,
Plaintiffs make various arguments regarding the burden of responding to the RPD
and Defendant’s failure to comply with his discovery obligations.  These arguments are irrelevant.  The court has already ordered Plaintiffs to
respond to the discovery, and any issue of Defendant’s lack of compliance is
not before the court.  Further,
Plaintiffs’ contention the court’s December 13, 2023 order did not require it to
produce private financial information is incorrect.  The court ordered Plaintiffs to produce “all
responsive confidential documents” after entry of a stipulated protective
order.  The court entered the parties’
stipulated protective order on January 2, 2024. 
As such, Plaintiffs were required to produce confidential documents
under that protective order, including private financial information.  Plaintiffs concede
they produced responsive documents in batches, which were Bates- stamped
consecutively.  (Declaration of Zoe M.
Vallier, ¶ 12.)  This is improper.  Plaintiffs must sort and label the responsive
documents to correspond to the categories of Defendant’s RPD.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.280, subd. (a).)  If Plaintiffs contend they do not have access
to responsive documents, Plaintiffs must provide the name and address of anyone
Plaintiffs believe might have such documents.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.230.)  Plaintiffs apparently have not done so.  (Opposition to Motion to Compel Compliance
with Court’s Order, p. 10.)  The court finds Plaintiffs’
failure to properly produce responsive documents in compliance with this court’s
December 13, 2023 order is an abuse of the discovery process and imposes
sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010,
subd. (g), 2031.320, subd. (c).)  The court
imposes sanctions against Plaintiffs and their counsel of record, Ervin Cohen
& Jessup, LLP, jointly and severally, in the amount of $2,260, which
represents four hours of attorney time for Defendant to prepare this motion at
$550 per hour, plus the filing fee. 
Plaintiffs and their counsel of record are to pay sanctions in that
amount to Defendant, by and through counsel, within 30 days of notice of this
order.Defendant is
ordered to give notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
