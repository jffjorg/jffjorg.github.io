And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the motion to compel further discovery responses filed by Defendant Steven C. Kim. The court previously ordered Plaintiffs 3800 West Sixth Street, LLC and Leo Lee to produce all documents in response to Defendant's Requests for Production of Documents. However, Plaintiffs have only produced documents in batches, not sorted and labeled according to the categories of the RPD. The court finds this to be an abuse of the discovery process and imposes sanctions on Plaintiffs and their counsel in the amount of $2,260. The court also orders Plaintiffs to properly produce responsive documents in compliance with the court's December 13, 2023 order.
