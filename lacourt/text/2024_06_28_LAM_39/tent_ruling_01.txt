Plaintiff 3800 West Sixth Street, LLC



 
MOTION
Defendant Steven
C. Kim (“Defendant”) moves to compel further responses from Plaintiff 3800 West
Sixth Street, LLC (“Plaintiff”) to Special Interrogatories, set one (“SROG”).  Plaintiff opposes the motion. Defendant filed
his separate statement on March 5, 2024, pursuant to this court’s December 13,
2023 order.  
ANALYSIS
If the propounding
party deems responses to interrogatories unsatisfactory, the propounding party
may move to compel further responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300.)  
For the SROG at issue,
Plaintiff is asked to state the facts and identify the documents that support
allegations in its complaint.  Defendant
contends Plaintiff’s responses do not state facts that support the
allegations.  Defendant cannot compel
Plaintiff to state certain facts, even if Plaintiff necessarily knows such
facts.  (Wimberly v. Derby Cycle Corp.
(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 618, 634.) Defendant’s remedy is to file a motion in
limine to exclude Plaintiff from producing evidence at trial that Plaintiff did
not disclose in discovery.  (Mitchell
v. Superior Court (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 269, 272.)
In response to
SROG Nos. 2, 5, 11, 14, 17, 20, 26, 41, 44, 47, 50 and 53, Plaintiff states it has
not completed reviewing documents to permit it to respond.  Such a response is improper.  Plaintiff must provide “complete and
straightforward” responses to the SROG. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220, subds. (a)-(b).)  Plaintiff cannot unilaterally extend its
deadline to complete responses to Defendant’s discovery.  It must, at minimum, identify and summarize responsive
documents.  (Deyo v. Kilbourne
(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 783-784.)  If
Plaintiff contends documents are in the possession of Defendant or others,
Plaintiff must so state and specify the efforts Plaintiff has made to obtain
the documents.  (Id., at p. 782.)  The court grants the motion to compel further
responses to SROG Nos. 2, 5, 11, 14, 17, 20, 26, 41, 44, 47, 50 and 53.  Plaintiff is to serve the further responses
to these SROG within 30 days.
The court declines
to award sanctions to Defendant.  In its December
13, 2023 order, the court permitted Defendant to file this motion without
attempting to informally resolve this dispute with Plaintiff so that Defendant
could meet the jurisdictional deadline for the filing.  Under these circumstances, an award of
sanctions would be unjust.  (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d) [monetary sanction not
to be imposed on party who unsuccessfully opposes motion to compel when “circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust”].)  
Defendant is ordered
to give notice of this order and to file a proof of service concerning it.
