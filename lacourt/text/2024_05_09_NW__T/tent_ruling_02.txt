 Case Number:  BC659059    Hearing Date:   May 9, 2024    Dept:  T DOE V LAUSD BC659059 Tentative Ruling: Hearing on  Defendant’s Election to Make Periodic Payments pursuant to California Rules of  Court 3.1804 and Government Code section 984: Hear argument. The motion was timely made.  The defendant is accorded an extended time to  file an appeal.  An appeal bond would not  be required and the judgment would be stayed pending appeal. The hearing on the  motion is within 30 days of the filing of the motion.  A hearing date within 30 days was unavailable  and the court previously improvidently denied an application to advance the  hearing. However, the court now hears the motion within 30 days. There is no requirement under  these circumstances for the defendant to pay 50% of the judgment. The time to  appeal has not yet expired.   The court has not yet granted the  defendant's election.  The court  interprets the requirement as once the court grants the election, then 50% of  the judgment must be paid.  If an appeal  is filed, then the enforcement of the judgment is stayed. This option is available only to  public entities that are “not insured” (Gov.C. § 984(d))—i.e., public entities  that have no liability insurance; or that are self-insured by themselves, or  through an insurance pooling arrangement, a joint powers agreement, the Local  Agency Self Insurance Authority, or “any other similar arrangement.” [ Gov.C. §  984(a)]  No judicial determination of  this has yet been made. Plaintiff's argument would  potentially result in an anomaly in which the defendant pays 50% of the  judgment but then is denied periodic payments on some technicality or because  it does not qualify; hence, the need for a hearing. Rule 8.108. Extending the time  to appeal (a) Extension of time This rule operates only to  extend the time to appeal otherwise prescribed in rule 8.104(a); it does not  shorten the time to appeal. If the normal time to appeal stated in rule  8.104(a) is longer than the time provided in this rule, the time to appeal stated  in rule 8.104(a) governs. (Subd (a) adopted effective  January 1, 2008.) (f) Public entity actions  under Government Code section 962, 984, or 985 If a public entity defendant  serves and files a valid request for a mandatory settlement conference on  methods of satisfying a judgment under Government Code section 962, an  election to pay a judgment in periodic payments under Government Code section  984 and rule 3.1804, or a motion for a posttrial hearing on reducing a  judgment under Government Code section 985, the time to appeal from the  judgment is extended for all parties until the earliest of: (1)  90 days after the superior court clerk serves  the party filing the notice of appeal with a document entitled "Notice of  Entry" of judgment, or a filed-endorsed copy of the judgment, showing the  date either was served; (2)  90 days after the party filing the notice of  appeal serves or is served by a party with a document entitled "Notice of  Entry" of judgment or a filed-endorsed copy of the judgment, accompanied  by proof of service; or (3)  180 days after entry of judgment. (Subd (f) amended effective  January 1, 2016; adopted effective January 1, 2011.)
