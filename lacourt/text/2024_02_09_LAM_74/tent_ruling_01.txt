  Case Number:  18STCL13165    Hearing Date:   February 9, 2024    Dept:  74 Melynda
Bryan, et al. v. Chad Jeremy Cassady, et al.
Motion to Tax Costs
The
court considered the moving papers and Defendant’s notice of non-opposition.
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from a dispute
over a used motorhome.
            On
October 22, 2018, Plaintiffs Melynda Bryan and Errick Bryan (Plaintiffs) filed
a complaint against Defendant Chad Jeremy Cassady (Defendant).
            On
June 4, 2021, Plaintiffs amended the complaint to include Co-Defendant Tiffanie
Cassady (Co-Defendant).
            On
November 1, 2022, the court granted Co-Defendant’s motion to quash service of
summons.
            On
September 18, 2023, the court entered judgment in favor of Defendant.
            On
October 2, 2023, Defendant filed a memorandum of costs.
            On
October 13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed this motion to tax Defendant’s costs.
LEGAL STANDARD
            The
prevailing party is entitled to recover costs, including attorneys’ fees, as a
matter of right, except as otherwise expressly provided by statute. (¿¿See Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 1032, subd. (a)(4), 1032, subd. (b), 1033.5¿¿.)¿Costs
recoverable under¿¿section 1032¿¿are restricted to those that are both
reasonable in amount and reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation.
(¿Code Civ. Proc.,¿§§ 1033.5, subd. (c)(2), (3)¿.)¿Costs “¿merely convenient or
beneficial¿” to the preparation of a case are disallowed. (¿Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5, subd. (c)(2)¿.)  
            “¿A
‘verified memorandum of costs is prima facie evidence of [the] propriety’ of
the items listed on it, and the burden is on the party
challenging these costs to demonstrate that they were not reasonable or
necessary.¿” (¿¿Adams v. Ford Motor Co. (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1475,
1486-1487 [italics and brackets omitted]¿¿.)¿Costs otherwise allowable as a
matter of right may be disallowed if the court determines they were not
reasonably necessary, and the court has power to reduce the amount of any cost
item to an amount that is reasonable. (See Perko’s Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS
Enterprises¿(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 245 [finding that¿“the intent and
effect of section 1033.5, subdivision¿(c)(2) is to authorize a trial court to
disallow recovery of costs, including filing fees, when it determines the costs
were incurred unnecessarily”].)¿
DISCUSSION  
            In
support of their motion to tax costs, Plaintiffs contend Defendant improperly seeks
to recover costs incurred by Co-Defendant. The costs include $446.96 in filing
fees for Co-Defendant’s successful motion to quash service of summons and
$14.52 in related electronic filing fees. Defendant, for his part, does not
oppose the motion.
CONCLUSION 
The
court grants Plaintiffs’ motion to tax costs. The court will tax $461.48 from
Defendant’s memorandum of costs.
Plaintiffs
shall give notice.
