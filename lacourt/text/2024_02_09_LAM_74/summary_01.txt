And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court considered the motion to tax costs filed by the plaintiffs, who are disputing the defendant's request to recover costs incurred by the co-defendant. The court found that the defendant's request is improper because the co-defendant's motion to quash service of summons was successful, and the costs incurred by the co-defendant were not reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion to tax costs and ordered the defendant to pay $461.48 from their memorandum of costs.
