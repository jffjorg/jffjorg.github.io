Defendant’s demurrer does not separately contain the demurrer pursuant to CRC,
rule 3.1320(a). However, the notice substantially complies with this

[3]
Defendant’s reliance on Gov. Code § 820.4 is similarly misplaced at this time
because there are no allegations that any defendant was “execut[ing] or
enforce[ing] any law.”
