And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer to the complaint filed by the City of Montebello is sustained with leave to amend. The demurrer was filed because the complaint does not state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action. The judge found that the parties did not meet and confer before filing the demurrer, but this is not a sufficient ground to overrule the demurrer.

The judge also found that the complaint lacks specific allegations of negligence and does not make clear which of the defendant's actions were negligent. The complaint alleges the elements of a motor vehicle claim, but does not provide sufficient detail.

The judge has given the plaintiffs 30 days to file an amended complaint and has sustained the demurrer as to the defendant Montebello Police Department in full. The judge has also denied the defendant's request for judicial notice and has disregarded the defendant's reliance on a separate action and prior admissions.
