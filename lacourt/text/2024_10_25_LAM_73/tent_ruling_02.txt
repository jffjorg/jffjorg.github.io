BACKGROUND
 
On July 12, 2023, Plaintiffs Eloy Garcia and Pauline Arredondo filed
the instant action against Defendant KIA America, Inc. Plaintiff alleges the
following causes of action:
1.    
Breach of Express Warranty under The Song-Beverly Act
2.    
Breach of lmplied Warranty of Merchantability under The
Song-Beverly Act
3.    
Civil Code § 1793.2(b) under The Song-Beverly Act
 
The Complaint alleges the following. On or about March 16, 2021,
Plaintiffs acquired a 2021 Kia Sorento, vehicle identification number
5XYRK4LF2MG020013 (“Vehicle”), for paid and/or payable consideration. All owners and lessees of 2021 KIA vehicles receive multiple
express warranties directly from Defendant for periods of up to 10 years or
100,000 miles. The Vehicle was delivered to Plaintiffs with serious defects and
nonconformities to warranty and developed other serious defects and
nonconformities to warranty including, but not limited to loss of power, engine
and related systems, check engine light, engine misfire, engine failure,
powertrain system, auto stop/start, safety recalls, transmission and related
systems, excessive days out of service and other defects. However, Defendant
has failed to conform the Vehicle to the applicable warranties because said
defects, malfunctions, misadjustments, and/or nonconformities continue to exist
even after a reasonable number of attempts to repair was given. 
 
On March 19, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set
One, arguing:
·       Plaintiffs move to compel further responses to Request Nos. 10, 11, 15,
22-26, 28-29, 33, 37-78.
·       Plaintiffs
requested the following categories of documents: (1) those relating
specifically to Plaintiffs and the subject vehicle (Request Nos. 33); (2) those
relating to Defendant’s knowledge, internal investigations, analysis and
publications of defects plaguing the Vehicle (Request Nos. 15, 28-29, 37-78);
and (3) those relating to Defendant’s warranty and vehicle repurchase policies,
procedures, and practices (Request Nos. 10, 11, 22-26).
·       The foregoing
documents are probative of the existence of engine and other related systems’
defects in 2021 Kia Sorrento vehicles, Defendant’s knowledge of those defects,
Defendant’s inability to repair those defects within a reasonable number of
attempts and Defendant’s willful noncompliance with its obligations under
Song-Beverly. 
·       Defendant
responded to the requests with boilerplate objections and did not provide any
emails, memoranda or studies reflecting investigations into the Vehicle’s
defects. Defendant’s responses are not code compliant.
 
Defendant filed an opposition, arguing:
·       On June 20,
2024, Defendant produced additional documents such as the Call Matrix, and
Service Policy and Procedure Manual.
·       Plaintiffs
numerous requests seek documents relating to vehicles of the same year, make
and model as the subject vehicle) that contain an undefined and overly broad
set of characteristics. Such information has no relevance to Plaintiffs’
claims.
 
Plaintiff filed a reply, arguing:
·       Defendant
produced further supplemental documents on June 20, 2024. Upon review of these
documents, many requests have been remedied. However, there are a number of
requests still at issue: Request Nos. 11, 28-29, and 37-78.
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.     Legal
Standard 
 
Motions to
compel further responses must always be accompanied by a meet-and
confer-declaration 
A motion to
compel further production must set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand. (See Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310(b)(1).) It is not necessary for the motion to show that the material
sought will be admissible in evidence. “Good cause” may be found to justify
discovery where specific facts show that the discovery is necessary for
effective trial preparation or to prevent surprise at trial. (See Associated
Brewers Dist. Co. v. Superior Court (1967) 65 Cal.2d 583, 586-588; see also
CCP §§ 2017.010, 2019.030(a)(1) (Information is discoverable if it is itself
admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence and it is not unreasonably cumulative or
duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient,
less burdensome, or less expensive.); Lipton v. Superior Court (1996) 48
Cal.App.4th 1599, 1611-1612 (noting a party may obtain discovery regarding any
matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the
pending action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or
appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence).) 
 
A motion to
compel further responses to a demand for inspection or production of documents
(“RFP”) may be brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of compliance; (2)
inadequate, evasive or incomplete claims of inability to comply; or (3)
unmerited or overly generalized objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310(c).) 
 
A motion to
compel a further response to a request for production must be noticed within 45
days of the service of the response, or any supplemental response, or on or
before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the
responding party have agreed in writing.  Otherwise, the propounding party
waives any right to compel further response to the inspection demand. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(c); see also Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1409; Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior Court (1983) 147
Cal.App.3d 681, 685.)  The motion must also be accompanied by a
declaration stating facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of any issue presented by it. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§
2016.040, 2031.310(b)(2).) Finally, a motion to compel further responses to
inspection demands must be accompanied by a separate document that sets forth
each item to which further response is requested and the factual and legal
reasons for compelling it. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a).)  
 
B.     Meet and
Confer
 
Plaintiffs’
counsel states she sent a meet and confer letters to Defendant's counsel
regarding deficiencies with the discovery responses at issue. (Le Decl., ¶¶ 14-19.) However, Plaintiffs’
counsel states Defendant has not provided any further supplemental responses
and has failed to produce any additional documents. (Le Decl., ¶ 20.) The Court finds the moving
party has met its meet and confer obligation. Accordingly, the Court will consider
the merits of the motion.
 
C.     Discussion
 
In Plaintiffs’ Notice of Motion, they
assert that Plaintiffs move to compel further responses to Request Nos. 10, 11, 15,
22-26, 28-29, 33, 37-78. However, in Plaintiffs’ reply, Plaintiffs contend that
Defendant produced further supplemental documents on June 20, 2024. Upon
review of these documents, Plaintiffs
state that many requests have been remedied. In Plaintiffs reply, they specify that they only move to compel further
responses to Request Nos. 11,
28-29, and 37-78. Thus, Plaintiffs’ motion to compel further responses
to Request Nos. 10, 15, 22-26 and 33 is MOOT.
 
a.     Request No. 11
 
Request No.
11 seeks “A copy of the Workshop Manual specifying diagnosis and repair
procedures for vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the SUBJECT
VEHICLE.”
 
Defendant
objected to this request, including on the grounds that the request is vague, overly
broad, unduly burdensome, lacks the requisite specificity, seeks confidential
information, seeks documents that are not reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence and is irrelevant. 
 
Plaintiffs contend
that the document is probative to establish Defendant’s inability to repair
Plaintiffs’ vehicle and that it had knowledge of such inability, thereby
justifying the imposition of a civil penalty. In this action, Plaintiffs must prove that Defendant failed to
repair substantially impairing defects in the subject Vehicle after a
reasonable number of repair attempts. (Oregel v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc.
(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101)
 
The Court
finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated good cause as to why the information
sought in these requests is necessary and relevant to their case. The requested
information is relevant to Plaintiffs’ Song-Beverly claims. The requests are
narrowly tailored, not overbroad and Defendant has not shown that responding to
these requests would be unduly burdensome. To show objectionable burden
requires a declaration from the responding party specifying each of the tasks
required to answer each discovery request and the number of hours required to
do those tasks for each discovery request. (Coriell v. Superior Court
(1974) 39 Cal. App. 3d 487, 493; Perkins v. Superior Court (1981) 118
Cal. App. 3d 761, 764.) To the extent Defendant asserts a privacy privilege, it must
submit a privilege log identifying the documents and the grounds for
establishing protection for the determination of the applicability of such
privilege. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240(c)(1) [“If an objection is based on a
claim of privilege or a claim that the information sought is protected work
product, the response shall provide sufficient factual information for other
parties to evaluate the merits of that claim, including, if necessary, a
privilege log.”].) Here, Defendant has not provided a declaration showing undue
burden, nor has Defendant provided a privilege log. 
 
The Court
GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion to compel further response to request for production
of document Nos. 11.
 
b.     Request Nos.
28-29, 37-78
 
Request Nos. 28-29
and 37-78 seek documents relating to Defendant’s knowledge, internal
investigations, analysis and publications of defects plaguing the Vehicle.
 
Defendant objects
to these requests and argues the information sought is irrelevant.
Specifically, that information about other vehicles, concerns and complaints
are not relevant and beyond the scope of Plaintiffs’ causes of action. 
 
Plaintiffs
argue that this information is relevant and may serve as proof of the existence
of a defect or nonconformity, as well as
Defendant’s knowledge of widespread warranty problems and Defendant’s failure
to act despite this knowledge.
 
The Court
finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated good cause as to why the information
sought in these requests is necessary and relevant to their case. Regarding
Defendant’s objections based on undue burden and privilege, as discussed above,
Defendant
has not provided a declaration showing undue burden nor has Defendant provided
a privilege log.
 
The Court
GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to compel further responses to request for production
of document Nos. 28-29 and 37-78.
 
DISPOSITION
 

Plaintiffs’ motion to compel further
responses to the Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. 11, 28-29, and 37-78 is GRANTED. Defendant shall provide code-compliant responses within
30 days.
Plaintiffs’ motion to compel further responses to Request Nos. 10,
15, 22-26 and 33 is MOOT.
