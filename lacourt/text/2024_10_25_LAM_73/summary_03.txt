And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled in favor of the plaintiffs' motion to compel the deposition of the person most knowledgeable (PMK) with production of documents. The PMK is required to provide deposition and produce documents within 20 days of the hearing. The judge has also denied the plaintiffs' request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,860.00.

The judge found that the defendant failed to comply with a properly noticed deposition for its PMK on the topics in the plaintiffs' notice of deposition. The defendant's objections to the deposition notice were found to be invalid, and the defendant did not file a protective order or motion to quash the deposition notice.

The judge also found that the defendant had shown substantial justification for its inability to comply with the deposition notice due to the bankruptcy proceedings and the wind-down process that is being overseen by the Bankruptcy Trustee. The defendant's assets were sold, including the hospital, and the acquiring company, Adventist Health, took possession of all documents relevant to the past and current patients of the hospital.
