And here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to their requests for production of documents, Set One, Nos. 11, 28-29, and 37-78. Defendant is required to provide code-compliant responses within 30 days. The judge finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated good cause for the discovery sought and that the information is relevant to their case. The judge also grants Plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to request for production of document Nos. 28-29 and 37-78. However, the judge finds that Plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to Request Nos. 10, 15, 22-26 and 33 is moot since Defendant has already provided supplemental responses to these requests.
