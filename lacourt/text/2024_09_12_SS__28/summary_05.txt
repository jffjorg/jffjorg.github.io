And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The plaintiff, Adela Bautista Hernandez, filed a complaint against defendants Dean Enterprises, Iris M. Whiting, and Does 1-50 on June 14, 2022. The defendants filed an answer on August 23, 2022. The plaintiff then filed motions to compel the defendants' responses to requests for production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories, and requested sanctions.

The court grants the plaintiff's motions to compel the defendants' responses to the requests for production of documents, special interrogatories, and form interrogatories. The defendants are ordered to serve verified code-compliant responses to the requests without objections and to produce the requested documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things by October 11, 2024.

The court denies the plaintiff's requests for sanctions. The court finds that the defendants did not oppose the motions to compel responses, and therefore, sanctions are not available under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300. The court also notes that the Supreme Court has held that a court may not rely on Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 to override the limitations prescribed by other applicable sanctions provisions in the Civil Discovery Act.

The court's ruling is intended to compel the defendants to respond to the plaintiff's requests and to deny the plaintiff's requests for sanctions.
