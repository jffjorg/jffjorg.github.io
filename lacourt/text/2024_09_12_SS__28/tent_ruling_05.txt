PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to compel Whiting’s and
Dean’s responses to requests for production of documents, set one, special
interrogatories, set one, and form interrogatories, set one.  Plaintiff also requests sanctions. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides in part: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subds. (a), (b), (c).)  
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides in part: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.)  
DISCUSSION 
On
September 22, 2023, Plaintiff served requests for production of documents, set
one, special interrogatories, set one, and form interrogatories, set one, on
Whiting and Dean.  Whiting and Dean did
not serve timely responses and had not served responses by the time Plaintiff
filed these motions on August 8, 2024. 
The Court grants Plaintiff’s motions to compel Whiting’s
and Dean’s responses to Plaintiff’s requests for production of documents, set
one, and orders Whiting and Dean to serve verified code-compliant responses to
the requests for production of documents, without objections, and to produce the
documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested
without objections by October 11, 2024. 
The
Court grants Plaintiff’s motions to compel Whiting’s and Dean’s responses to
Plaintiff’s special interrogatories, set one, and orders Whiting and Dean to
serve verified code-compliant responses to the special interrogatories without
objections by October 11, 2024. 
The
Court grants Plaintiff’s motions to compel Whiting’s and Dean’s responses to
Plaintiff’s form interrogatories, set one, and orders Whiting and Dean to serve
verified code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories without
objections by October 11, 2024. 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to impose sanctions on Whiting and Dean on each motion.  Under Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300, the Court shall impose a
monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories or a demand
for inspection unless the Court finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.  (See
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c)
[demand for inspection].) 
Whiting
and Dean did not make or oppose a motion to compel responses to interrogatories
or a demand for inspection. Therefore, sanctions are not available under Code
of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300. 
Other
statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,
authorize a sanctions award on Plaintiff’s motions.  In City of Los Angeles v.
Pricewaterhousecoopers, LLP (Aug. 23, 2024) __ Cal.5th __ [2024 WL 3894042,
2024 DJDAR 8056, slip opn. pp. 1-42] (PwC), the Supreme Court held: “It
is already well-established that a court may not rely on [Code of Civil
Procedure] section 2023.030 to override the limitations prescribed by any other
applicable sanctions provision in the [Civil Discovery] Act.  A court may invoke its independent
authority to impose sanctions under sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 only when
confronted with an unusual form of discovery abuse, or a pattern of abuse, not
already addressed by a relevant sanctions provision.  And where it invokes that
authority, it is constrained by the long-settled rules generally governing the
imposition of discovery sanctions under the Act.”  (PwC, supra, __ Cal.5th __
[2024 WL 3894042 at *18, 2024 DJDAR at p. 8066, slip opn. at p. 40].) 
Code
of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290, subdivision (c), and 2031.300,
subdivision (c), limit the Court’s authority to impose sanctions when (as here)
the non-moving party does not oppose a successful motion to compel responses to
interrogatories or inspection demands. 
Because these statutes address the issue, the Court may not invoke its
independent authority to impose sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2023.010 and 2023.030.  (See PwC,
supra, __ Cal.5th __ [2024 WL 3894042 at *18, 2024 DJDAR at p. 8066,
slip opn. at p. 40].) 
The
Court denies Plaintiff’s sanctions requests.
