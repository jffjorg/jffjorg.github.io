And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion to set aside the default and default judgment filed by Defendant Roland Ononaiwu and has denied the motion. The court found that the Defendant did not move to set aside the default until July 5, 2024, more than six months after the default was entered on December 20, 2021. The court also noted that the Defendant was served with the summons, complaint, and other documents on July 15, 2021, and therefore had sufficient time to respond to the lawsuit. The court relied on California Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), which provides that a party may be relieved from a judgment or dismissal if they were not aware of the lawsuit due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. However, the court found that the Defendant's lack of awareness was not due to any of these factors, and therefore did not grant the motion to set aside the default and default judgment.
