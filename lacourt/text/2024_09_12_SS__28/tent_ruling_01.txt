  Case Number:  21STCV23426    Hearing Date:   September 12, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving and opposition papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
June 24, 2021, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Roland
Ononaiwu aka Roland Onoaiwu (“Defendant”) and Does 1-10 for subrogation.  The complaint demanded $78,363.35. 
On
July 21, 2021, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted service
of the summons, complaint, and other documents on Defendant by a registered California
process server on July 15, 2021. 
On December 20, 2021, the clerk entered Defendant’s
default. 
On
November 1, 2022, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
On
February 8, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s application for entry of
default judgment and entered judgment against Defendant for $84,935.44. 
On
March 26, 2024, Plaintiff served notice of entry of judgment on Defendant. 
On
July 5, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to set aside the default and
default judgment.  The motion was set for
hearing on September 12, 2024.  On August
29, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Defendant
asks the Court to set aside the default and default judgment under the discretionary provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), provides in part: 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve
a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order,
or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall
be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subdivision (b).) 
DISCUSSION 
Defendant
asks the Court to set aside the default and default judgment under the
discretionary provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).
Defendant argues that, as a result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, and/or
excusable neglect, Defendant was not aware of this lawsuit until after the
Court entered the default judgment. 
Although
Defendant asserts that the default was entered on February 8, 2024, the clerk
in fact entered Defendant’s default on December 20, 2021.  Defendant did not move to set aside the
default until July 5, 2024, more than six
months after December 20, 2021. 
Therefore, the Court denies the request to set aside the default under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).  (See L. Edmon & C.
Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2024) ¶ 5:279,
p. 5-75 (Cal. Practice Guide) [motion for discretionary relief from default under Code Civ.
Proc., § 473, subd. (b), is ineffective if filed more than six months after
clerk’s entry of default, “even if it is within 6 months after entry of default
judgment”].) 
Because
the Court cannot set aside the default under Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (b), it would be “ ‘an idle act’ ” to set aside the default
judgment.  (Pulte Homes Corp. v. Williams
Mechanical, Inc. (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 267, 273, quoting Howard Greer
Custom Originals v. Capritti (1950) 35 Cal.2d 886, 888 (Capritti).)  “ ‘ “If the judgment were vacated, it would
be the duty of the court immediately to render another judgment of like effect,
and the defendants, still being in default, could not be heard in opposition
thereto . . . .” ’ ” (Ibid., quoting Capritti, supra, 35
Cal.2d at pp. 888–889; see Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 5:414.1, p. 5-121;
Weiss v. Blumencranc (1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 536, 541; Koski v. U–Haul
Co. (1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 640, 643.) 
The
Court therefore concludes that Defendant is not entitled to relief under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Roland Ononaiwu’s motion to set aside the default and default
judgment. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
