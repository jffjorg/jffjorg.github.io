 Section
12a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses were $74,708.94.  Section 12a(3) states that this amount was
subject to $47,082.18 in reductions. 
This should mean that the remaining amount ($27,626.76) is to be
reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
However, Section 12a(4) states that 
$36,468.82 is to be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  This is $8,842.06 more than the difference
between the total medical expenses incurred and the amount by which those
medical expenses were reduced. 
Petitioner
states that the amount to be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds
($36,468.82) includes the following expenses:  ·       $25,376.76 - Medical lien reimbursement to Anthem Blue
Cross ERISA Plan·      
$3,842.06 -
Anthem Blue Cross co-pays paid by parents Bruce & Kathy Moura·       $2,250.00 - past psychological visits with Dr. Payne
paid by parents Bruce & Kathy Moura·       $5,000.00 - 20 future psychological visits with Dr.
Payne to be paid by parents Bruce & Kathy Moura
It
appears that the $8,842.06 figure (above) consists of (1) $3,842.06 for Anthem
Blue Cross co-pays paid by parents Bruce & Kathy Moura and (2) $5,000.00 for
20 future psychological visits with Dr. Payne to be paid by parents Bruce &
Kathy Moura. 
With
this understanding, the Court finds that the petition shows that all medical expenses
which have not been waived or reduced will be paid or reimbursed from the
settlement proceeds.  The Court grants
the petition.CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS the petition to approve the compromise of minor Plaintiff Ruby
Moura’s action filed by Petitioner Kathy Moura on August 22, 2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
