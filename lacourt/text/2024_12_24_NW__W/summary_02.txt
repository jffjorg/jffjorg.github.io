As for the English-text summary:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition regarding how she found her doctor and whether it was attorney-referred. The judge finds that the questions are relevant and not barred by attorney-client privilege, citing the case of Qaadir v. Figueroa. The judge also grants the defendants' request for sanctions in the amount of $310.00, reducing the amount from the original request of $810.00. The judge's decision is based on the plaintiff's failure to answer certain questions at her deposition and the defendants' motion to compel her deposition.
