And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants to the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The defendants demurred to the complaint on the grounds that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a claim.

The judge agreed with the defendants that the allegations in the complaint are insufficient to state a claim for breach of oral contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, conversion, and misappropriation of funds. The judge sustained the demurrer to these causes of action without leave to amend.

However, the judge granted leave to amend the breach of oral contract cause of action, stating that the plaintiff has shown a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. The judge also granted leave to amend the breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing cause of action, stating that the plaintiff must allege more than conclusory terms that the defendants unfairly interfered with the plaintiff's rights.

The judge did not grant leave to amend the fraud, conversion, and misappropriation of funds causes of action, stating that the allegations in the complaint are insufficient to state a claim.
