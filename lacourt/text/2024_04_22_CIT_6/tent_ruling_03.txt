   [1] The Court notes that Lincoln demurs  to each cause of action in the FAC, but not the entire complaint. (See Notice  of Demurrer and Demurrer.) The argument that the entire FAC is subject to  demurrer first arises in Lincoln’s memorandum of points and authorities. (Mem.  Points & Authorities, p. 10.) This should have been specified in the  demurrer. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1320, subd. (a).) The Court will still  consider this argument, but admonishes Lincoln to comply with the requirements  of the California Rules of Court going forward.   [2] The Court  declines to discuss the parties’ arguments regarding City & Cnty. of San  Francisco v. Purdue Pharma. L.P. (N.D. Cal. 2020) 491 F.Supp.3d 610, as it  is nonbinding federal law. (Johnson v. American Standard, Inc. (2008) 43  Cal.4th 56, 69 [federal opinions deciding state law are not binding on  states].)   [3] This refers  to the prior version of Business and Professions Code section 26038 in effect  when this action was filed, as the statute was updated effective January 1,  2024. (See Bus. & Prof. Code, § 26038.) All references herein are to the  prior version in effect when this action was filed.
