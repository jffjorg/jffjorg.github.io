 Case Number:  22PSCV00369    Hearing Date:   April 22, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE NAME:  Ralf Weigel v. Terrence Sperry Motion to be Relieved as Defendant’s Counsel TENTATIVE RULING The Court GRANTS the motion to be relieved as counsel.              Counsel is ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order. BACKGROUND This is a breach of contract action. On April 13, 2022, plaintiff Ralf Weigel (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Terrence Sperry (Defendant) and Does 1 to 10, alleging causes of action for breach of contract, conversion, replevin, and declaratory relief. Defendant filed an answer on September 26, 2022. On December 21, 2023, Defendant filed a cross-complaint against Plaintiff and Roes 1 through 20, alleging causes of action for failure to pay overtime, willful misclassification of employee as an independent contractor, failure to provide meal and rest breaks, waiting time penalties, failure to reimburse expenses, and conversion.             On April 2, 2024, Charles P. Boylston of the Law Offices of Charles P. Boylston, APC (Counsel), moved to be relieved as counsel for Defendant. The motion is unopposed. LEGAL STANDARD The Court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted, provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.)A motion to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the client and on all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) DISCUSSION                       Counsel moves to be relieved as counsel for Defendant on the grounds that conflicts have arisen, along with a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and a breach of an obligation to Counsel’s office. (Boylston Decl., Attachment 2, ¶¶ 3-5.) The Court finds these to be proper grounds for withdrawal. Grounds for permitting an attorney to withdraw from representation include the client’s conduct that “renders it unreasonably difficult for the lawyer to carry out the representation effectively[.]” (Cal. Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1.16, subd. (b)(4).) A breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is also grounds for allowing the attorney to withdraw. (Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.)             The Court finds that Counsel’s motion and accompanying documents address the issues set forth in the Court’s March 27, 2024 order denying the prior motion to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. (Order re Tentative Ruling (3/27/24).) Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the motion. CONCLUSION The Court GRANTS the motion to be relieved as counsel.              Counsel is ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
