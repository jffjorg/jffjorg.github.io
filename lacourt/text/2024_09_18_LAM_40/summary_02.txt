Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in YAML format:

**Case Information**

* Case Number: 24STCV12055
* Hearing Date: September 18, 2024
* Department: 40 Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles

**Parties**

* Plaintiff: Christina Yousefi
* Defendants: Pacific Premier Bank, Saaid El-Hendi, Mark Welch, Scott Peterson, and Does 1-100

**Background**

* Plaintiff Yousefi worked for Pacific Premier Bank from December 2019 to April 18, 2023
* She alleged causes of action for harassment, discrimination, retaliation, failure to engage in the interactive process, failure to accommodate, and wrongful termination based on her pregnancy and related medical conditions

**Motion**

* Defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration and stay the action pending arbitration
* Plaintiff Yousefi opposed the motion

**Analysis**

* The Judge found that the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable, but that the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 (EFAA) applies to Yousefi's pregnancy harassment claims
* The Judge concluded that Yousefi's remaining claims (discrimination, retaliation, failure to engage in the interactive process, failure to accommodate, and wrongful termination) are not "related" to her pregnancy harassment claims and should be arbitrated

**Ruling**

* The Judge denied the Defendants' motion to compel arbitration as to the entire case, citing the EFAA's applicability to Yousefi's pregnancy harassment claims

**Key Points**

* The EFAA applies to sexual harassment claims brought under state law, including claims alleging harassment based on pregnancy and related medical conditions
* The EFAA makes pre-dispute arbitration agreements unenforceable with respect to cases that relate to sexual harassment disputes
* The Judge relied on persuasive authority from New York, where this specific question of interpretation has been more substantially litigated than in California

**Significant Statements**

* "The EFAA gives individuals asserting sexual assault or sexual harassment claims under federal, state or tribal law the option to bring those claims in court even if they had agreed to arbitrate such disputes before the claims arose."
* "All of Yousefi's causes of action in this case relate to her pregnancy harassment allegation, the entire case falls under the EFAA."
* "The Defendants' motion to compel arbitration is DENIED."
