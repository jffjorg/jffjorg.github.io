And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Workman Design and Construction Pools and Landscapes, Inc. and Anthony Workman's motion for leave to file a First Amended Cross-Complaint. The parties have been engaged in litigation over a construction project, and Workman has filed a Cross-Complaint alleging various causes of action. The proposed First-Amended Cross-Complaint introduces a new cause of action, but the judge has determined that it does not introduce new factual allegations, only a new legal theory. The judge has also determined that the proposed amendment does not cause prejudice to Rebecca S. Rowe, the plaintiff, as the discovery cut-off is still more than 30 days away. Therefore, the judge has granted the motion for leave to amend the Cross-Complaint.
