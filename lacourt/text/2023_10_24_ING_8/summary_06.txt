And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by Defendant T-Mobile USA Tower, LLC is overruled as to the first and second causes of action (negligence and trespass) and sustained as to the third cause of action (nuisance). The ruling is based on the Judge's analysis of the pleadings and the arguments presented by the parties.

The Judge found that the plaintiffs' negligence claim is sufficient to state a cause of action, as it alleges that the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff and breached that duty, resulting in damages. The Judge also found that the plaintiffs' trespass claim is sufficient to state a cause of action, as it alleges that the defendant entered the plaintiff's property without permission and caused damage.

However, the Judge sustained the demurrer as to the nuisance claim, finding that it is duplicative of the negligence claim and does not adequately allege the necessary elements of a private nuisance claim.

The Judge ordered the plaintiffs to give notice and granted the defendant 21 days to amend its demurrer.
