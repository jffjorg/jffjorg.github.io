English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the defendants, South Park Doggie, Inc. et al., to the complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Lauren Hogan and Armando Hogan. The demurrer was sustained as to the strict liability and negligent infliction of emotional distress causes of action. The judge found that the plaintiffs' complaint failed to state a cause of action against the defendants for the death of their dog, Skye, who was attacked and killed by a pair of Basenjis at a pet care facility. The judge also found that the defendants did not owe a duty of care to the plaintiffs as they were not in a close relationship with Skye. The judge invited the plaintiffs to argue whether any amendment could cure the pleading defect.
