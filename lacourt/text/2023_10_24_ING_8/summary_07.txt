The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for leave of court to file a first amended complaint (FAC) by plaintiff Rosemary Pineau. The motion was filed on September 19, 2023, and no opposition was filed by the defendant. The Judge grants the motion, but notes that the motion fails to meet the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324. Despite this, the Judge grants the motion as a teaching opportunity to inform plaintiff's counsel of the requirements. The FAC is to be filed as a stand-alone document within 5 court days. Additionally, the case management conference set for November 2, 2023, is continued to February 6, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
