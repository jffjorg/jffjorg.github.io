And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling states that the Plaintiff, Mohammed Abdoun, has failed to carry his burden in bringing forth a Motion for Protective Order to prevent discovery of his prior felony convictions. The Defendants, South Bay Center SPE, LLC and CBRE, Inc., argue that the prior felony convictions are discoverable and relevant to the case.

The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's declaration does not provide admissible evidence meeting the burden of proof, and therefore, the motion is procedurally defective. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery requests regarding his prior felony convictions is untimely.

The Judge grants the motion for a protective order, but only to the extent that the Plaintiff is required to respond to the discovery requests regarding his prior felony convictions. The Judge also orders the Plaintiff to give a verified response to the discovery requests within 21 days.

The Judge declines to award monetary sanctions to the Defendant, CBRE, Inc., for filing an opposition to the Plaintiff's baseless motion.

The Judge will take oral argument as to whether the Defendants should be entitled to file sur-reply papers bearing on the new evidence raised for the first time at the Reply stage.
