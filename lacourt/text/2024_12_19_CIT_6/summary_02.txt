And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment against the defendant, Christopher Montoya. The plaintiff sought a default judgment of $30,671.60, including $30,000.00 in damages and $671.60 in costs. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's declaration did not contain documentary evidence supporting the $30,000.00 in damages, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 585. The judge also noted that the complaint did not allege the additional damages of $30,000.00, and therefore, the plaintiff cannot recover such damages in a default judgment. The judge cited several legal precedents, including Code of Civil Procedure section 580, Yu v. Liberty Surplus Ins. Corp. (2018), and Electronic Funds Solutions, LLC v. Murphy (2005), to support its decision.
