 Case Number:  24PSCV01096    Hearing Date:   December 19, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff
ARC California Escrow, Inc.’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendant: Christopher Montoya 
TENTATIVE RULING           
Plaintiff’s request for entry of
default judgment is DENIED.           
BACKGROUND           
            This
is a fraud and conversion case. On April 5, 2024, plaintiff ARC California Escrow,
Inc. (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Chris Montoya, an
individual also known as Christopher Montoya (Montoya), Firefighters First
Federal Credit Union (Firefighters), and Does 1 through 50, alleging causes of
action for conversion, fraud, violation of Penal Code § 496, accounting,
imposition of constructive trust, claim and delivery, and injunctive relief. 
            On
June 3, 2024, default was entered against Montoya. 
            On
November 25, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed Firefighters and the Doe defendants from
this action without prejudice. On the same date, Plaintiff requested entry of
default judgment against Montoya. 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration
of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff seeks default judgment
against Montoya in the total amount of $30,671.60, including $30,000.00 in
damages and $671.60 in costs. The Court finds Plaintiff’s default judgment
package defective, as it is not does not contain any documentary evidence supporting
the $30,000.00 in damages requested. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 585, subd.
(b) ["The court shall hear the evidence offered by
the plaintiff and shall render judgment in the plaintiff’s favor
for that relief, not exceeding the amount stated in the complaint,… as appears
by the evidence to be just"].) While evidence is not needed to
establish liability in the context of a default judgment because liability is
admitted on default, Plaintiff still needs to present evidence to establish the
amount of damages sought. (Carlsen v. Koivumaki (2014)
227 Cal.App.4th 879, 883-884.) Plaintiff’s declaration only provides
a general summary of hours worked in connection with this matter and a lump sum
of $30,000.00, and contains no hourly rates or documentary evidence supporting
the amount of hours purportedly expended on this matter. (Baiseri Decl., ¶ 9.) 
Moreover, the complaint does not allege
Plaintiff incurred $30,000.00 in incidental or other damages as a result of
Montoya’s conduct. The only damage amounts alleged in this action were the $245,642.71
wrongfully deposited into Montoya’s account, which Plaintiff appears to have
recovered since Plaintiff is not requesting recovery of those funds. (See
generally, Baiseri Decl.) The Court cannot award damages not alleged or
demanded in the complaint. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 585, subd. (b); Paterra
v. Hansen (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 507, 536; Greenup v. Rodman (1986)
42 Cal.3d 822, 826.) 
“Procedural due process requires ‘that
a defendant be given notice of the existence of a lawsuit and notice of the
specific relief which is sought in the complaint served upon him. The logic
underlying this principle is simple: a defendant who has been served with a
lawsuit has the right, in view of the relief which the complainant is seeking
from him, to decide not to appear and defend. However, a defendant is not in a
position to make such a decision if he or she has not been given full notice.’
[Citation.]” (Yu v. Liberty Surplus Ins. Corp. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th
1024, 1031.) .) “The purpose of [Code of Civil Procedure] section 580 is to
require the plaintiff to provide notice of the maximum amount of the
defendant's potential liability.” (Electronic Funds Solutions, LLC v. Murphy
(2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1174; see also Becker v. S.P.V. Constr. Co. (1980)
27 Cal.3d 489, 494 [“a prayer for damages according to proof passes muster
under section 580 only if a specific amount of damages is alleged in the body
of the complaint. [Citation]”.) Thus, “a default judgment greater than the
amount specifically demanded is void as beyond the [trial] court's
jurisdiction.” (Id. quoting Greenup, supra, 42 Cal.3d at p. 826.) Since,
the Complaint does not allege the additional damages of $30,000, Plaintiff
cannot recover such damages in a default judgment. 
CONCLUSION           
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request
for entry of default judgment is DENIED.
