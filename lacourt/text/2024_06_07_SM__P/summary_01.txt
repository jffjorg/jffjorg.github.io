Significant Statements:
  - "The Allocation Letter constitutes a contract, but only names plaintiff and non-party Rari Capital. None of the defendants was a party to the Allocation Letter contract, so they argue they have no written contract with plaintiff, and no contract exists between Yu and the three defendants."
  - "The court finds there remains a triable issue of material fact as to whether Infrastructure is a successor-in-interest."
  - "If, as plaintiff claims, he never elected to or consented to convert his RGT for TRIBE, defendants kept the TRIBE tokens, and he does not possess any RGT or TRIBE, then he may be able to prove that he did not assent to the defendants' taking of his RGT—whether it was converted to TRIBE or clawed back."

And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Yu v. Rari Capital Infrastructure, LLC, et al. The case involves a dispute over the ownership and control of cryptocurrency tokens, specifically RGT and TRIBE tokens.

The plaintiff, Yu, alleges that the defendants, Rari Capital Infrastructure, LLC, Fei Labs, Inc., and Longarzo, interfered with the 24-month vesting schedule of his RGT tokens, breached the Allocation Letter, and converted his RGT tokens to TRIBE tokens without his consent.

The defendants argue that Yu's RGT tokens have no value and that Yu consented to the conversion of his RGT tokens to TRIBE tokens. They also argue that they are not liable for any damages or wrongdoing.

The Court has found that there are triable issues of fact regarding the existence of a contract between plaintiff and defendants, the intent of defendants to deprive plaintiff of his property, and the validity of the conversion of plaintiff's RGT tokens to TRIBE tokens.

The Court has denied the defendants' motion for summary adjudication and summary judgment, and the case will proceed to trial.
