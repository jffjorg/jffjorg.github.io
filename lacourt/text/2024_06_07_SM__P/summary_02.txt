And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This ruling is a summary of the undisputed and disputed facts presented in the case. The plaintiff disputes the defendants' claims about the merger of the DAOs and the characterization of Yu's entitlement to the RGT. The ruling notes that the defendants claimed that the merger of the DAOs was a functional merger of Rari Capital and Fei Labs' business activities, but this is disputed by the plaintiff. The ruling also notes that Yu was originally allocated RGT, but this is also disputed by the defendants. The court will consider the undisputed and disputed facts in making its final ruling.
