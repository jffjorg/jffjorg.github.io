And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the parties' dispute over the timing of expert witness designations. The defendant served their expert witness designation on May 2, 2024, while the plaintiffs argue that it was untimely. The court finds that the minute order of January 24, 2024, specifically addressed the issue of discovery deadlines tied to the new trial date. The court declines to strike the defendant's expert witness designation, finding that the dispute was likely due to a misunderstanding between counsel. The court also declines to award sanctions to the defendant, as defense counsel did not respond to plaintiffs' counsel's emails on the issue. The motion to strike is denied.
