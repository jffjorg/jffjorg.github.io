Yu v. Rari Capital
Infrastructure, et al. Case No. 22SMCV01367
Hearing date June

Defendants’ Motion
for Summary Judgment and/or Summary Adjudication
 
On August 12, 2022,
plaintiff Yu filed a complaint against defendants Rari Capital Infrastructure,
LLC, Fei Labs, Inc. and Longarzo. Plaintiff’s first amended complaint alleges: (1)
breach of contract; (2) conversion; and (3) violation of Penal Code § 496. This
case arises out of an alleged wrongful misappropriation and theft of
plaintiff’s cryptocurrency tokens. Specifically, that defendants allegedly
interfered with the 24-month vesting schedule of plaintiff’s allocation of
70,000 Rari Governance Tokens (RGT) from non-party Rari Capital, Inc. (Rari
Capital), even though the 24-month vesting schedule was a term in an allocation
letter between Yu and Rari Capital.
 
Yu joined
non-party Rari Capital in April 2020. AMF No. 1.[1] Plaintiff became
the non-party’s User Interface/User Experience Designer. Abbott Decl., Ex. 3 at
30:2-14. On October 15, 2020, Rari Capital allocated him 70,000 RGT subject to
an allocation letter (Allocation Letter) with a 24-month vesting schedule. Yu
Decl. ¶11, Ex. 1. Plaintiff satisfied the conditions in the Allocation Letter
on or before October 20, 2020. Yu Decl. ¶13. According to the
Vesting Schedule, plaintiff’s 70,000 RGT would vest over time and completely
vest by the end of the 24-month period, i.e., by October 20, 2022. Yu Decl. ¶11
Ex. 1.
 
Rari Capital was
the creator of the Rari Capital DAO and the original issuer of RGT tokens. DMF
No. 15.[2] The Rari Capital DAO was a
decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). DMF No. 9. Fei is a computer
development company that provides blockchain development and code and
participated in the TRIBE DAO. UMF No. 14.[3] The Tribe DAO was
a DAO comprising TRIBE token holders. DMF No. 13. In December of 2021 Rari
Capital’s DAO merged into the TRIBE DAO. DMF No. 12.[4] 
 
The Rari Capital
DAO-Tribe DAO merger was set forth in a Merger Agreement. DMF No. 18; Longarzo
Decl. ¶17, Ex. 2. The Merger Agreement states RGT holders could “swap” RGT for
TRIBE (the Tribe governance token) at a fixed conversion rate. UMF No. 19. The
Merger Agreement explains a “PegExchanger Contract will facilitate the exchange
of RGT for TRIBE at the Exchange Rate” and the “Exchange Rate is defined here
as 26.7056734303 TRIBE: 1 RGT, equal to RGT Price divided by TRIBE Price.”
Longarzo Decl. ¶17, Ex. 2.
 
Defendant Rari
Capital Infrastructure LLC is a Delaware limited liability company, and a
computer development company that provides blockchain development and code and
participated in the Tribe DAO. UMF No. 16. The members of Rari Infrastructure
all came from Rari Capital and continued to perform work “[v]ery similar” to
what they had been doing at the prior entity. Abbott Decl., Ex. 1 at 34:15-21. Rari
Infrastructure took over the domains and administrator rights for the Rari
Capital websites. Abbott Decl., Ex. 1 at 43:35-44:21; Ex. 11. Rari
Infrastructure took over posting on the Rari Capital Twitter account. Abbott
Decl., Ex. 1 at 46:1-22. Lipstone, a co-founder of both Rari Capital and Rari
Infrastructure, could not recall why Rari Capital was formed, what its purpose
was, or whether it had any assets. Abbott Decl., Ex. 3 at 14:19-16:16.
 
In a call of
5/29/22, Longarzo informed Yu that Rari Infrastructure would be taking 90
percent of Yu’s RGT to fund hiring of new code developers. Yu Decl. ¶25.
Defendants claim Longarzo explained to Yu that the two-year vesting schedule no
longer applied and why Yu was now entitled to “approximately 10%” of the RGT he
had originally been allocated. Longarzo Decl. ¶28. However,
plaintiff disputes this “fact” to the extent it characterizes Yu’s entitlement
to only 10 percent of his allocated RGT, since plaintiff asserts he is entitled
to 100 percent of the allocated RGT. DMF No. 31.[5] Longarzo stated Yu “voted
for, approved and expressly authorized the RGT-TRIBE merger and the resulting
swapping of his RGT for TRIBE.” Longarzo Decl. ¶23. However, plaintiff disputes
this “fact,” and Yu stated (1) he did not vote to approve the merger, (2) he
voted to abstain, (3) holders of RGT could swap for TRIBE but were not required
to, (4) he never elected to convert his RGT to TRIBE, and (5) never consented
to having his RGT be put on a new vesting schedule. Yu Decl. ¶¶ 16-18.
 
Evidentiary
Objections
Plaintiff objects
to the declarations of Grieco and Longarzo. Plaintiff’s Objections 1 through 7
to the Grieco declaration are OVERRULED. Plaintiff’s Objections 1 through 22 to
the Longarzo declaration are OVERRULED.
 
Defendants raise
objections to the declarations of Yu and Abbott. Defendants’ Objection 1 to the
Yu declaration is SUSTAINED (lack of foundation). Defendants’ Objection 2 to
the Abbot declaration is OVERRULED.
 
Motion for Summary
Judgment
A party is
entitled to bring a motion for summary judgment where there are no triable
issues of fact and moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(c). Defendant bears the initial burden of establishing
one or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established or that there
is a complete defense to the cause of action. Id. subd. (p)(2). Only
when this initial burden is met does the burden shift to the opposing party to
show a triable issue of material fact. Id.
 
A party may move
for summary adjudication as to one or more causes of action if the party
contends the cause of action has no merit. Id. subd. (f)(1). A party may
move for summary adjudication as an alternative to summary judgment and shall
proceed in all procedural respects as a motion for summary judgment. Id.
subd. (f)(2).
 
To establish a triable issue of material fact,
opposing party must produce substantial responsive evidence. Sangster v.
Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166. Courts “liberally construe the
evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts
concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” Dore v. Arnold Worldwide,
Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389. “When the motion for summary judgment is
supported by affidavits sufficient to sustain the motion, however, the burden
of showing that triable issues exist shifts to the party opposing the motion.” Crouse
v. Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1509, 1524. “A
party cannot avoid summary judgment based on mere speculation and conjecture .
. . but must instead produce admissible evidence raising a triable issue of
fact.” Id., citation omitted. When reviewing a motion for summary
judgment, the court must view the supporting evidence, and inferences
reasonably drawn from such evidence, in the light most favorable to the
opposing party. Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826,
843.
 
(A) Breach
of Contract – against Rari Capital Infrastructure, LLC
 
A breach of contract claim requires: (1) existence of
the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
defendant's breach, and (4) resulting damages to the plaintiff. Oasis West
Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.
1.     
Existence of a Contract
between the Parties
 
Defendants argue they are not a party to a contract. “Breach of contract cannot be made the basis of an action for damages
against defendants who did not execute it and who did nothing to assume its
obligations.” Gold v. Gibbons (1960) 178 Cal.App.2d 517, 519. The
Allocation Letter constitutes a contract, but only names plaintiff and non-party Rari Capital. Yu Decl. ¶ 11, Ex. 1. None of the defendants was a party to the Allocation Letter contract, so
they argue they have no written contract with plaintiff, and no contract exists
between Yu and the three defendants. Defendants meet the initial burden, which
shifts to plaintiff to show a triable issue of material fact.
 
Plaintiff argues Infrastructure is a successor in interest, which are
bound by construction reasonably applicable to the original parties to the
contract. Spector v.
National Pictures Corp. (1962) 201 Cal.App.2d
217, 222. In Stanford Hotel Co. v. M. Schwind Co. (1919) 180 Cal. 348,
354, the Court held “where a corporation reorganizes under a new name, but with
practically the same stockholders and directors, and continues to carry on the
same business, a court of equity will regard the new corporation as a
continuation of the former corporation, and will hold it liable for the debts
of the former corporation.”
 
Plaintiff submits evidence Infrastructure is the successor to, and operates as, non-party Rari Capital, which
issued the Allocation Letter. DMF No. 40; Longarzo Decl. Ex. 1; Abbott Decl.
Ex. 1 at 34:15-21, 43:35-44:21, 48:16-49:12; Ex. 3 at 14:19-16:16. Infrastructure
took over the Rari Capital domain and website, has common ownership, and it
took individuals from Rari Capital to perform essentially the same work for
Infrastructure. DMF No. 40; Longarzo Decl. Ex. 1; Abbott Decl. Ex. 1 at
34:15-21, 43:35-44:21, 48:16-49:12; Ex. 3 at 14:19-16:16. 
 
The Allocation Letter provided a 24-month sliding-scale restriction
on how many RGT Yu may sell, effectively providing a 24-month vesting schedule.
FAC ¶21; AMF No. 3; Yu Decl. 11, Ex. 1; Abbott Decl. Ex. 3 at 41:12-20;
96:20-97:20. Even if Yu stopped working on the project, his allocation would
continue to vest. AMF No. 3; Yu Decl. Ex. 1; Abbott Decl., Ex. 3 at 41:12-20;
96:20-97:20. Plaintiff alleges Infrastructure, as successor to Rari Capital,
breached the Allocation Letter contract by preventing the vesting of
plaintiff’s RGT according to the 24-month vesting schedule. FAC ¶ 92.
 
Plaintiff’s evidence suggests the members of Infrastructure came from
Rari Capital and continued to perform work “[v]ery similar” to what they had
been doing at the prior entity. Infrastructure took over the domains and
administrator rights for the Rari Capital websites and took over posting on the
Rari Capital Twitter account. Lipstone, a co-founder of both Rari Capital and
Infrastructure, could not recall why Rari Capital was formed, what its purpose
was, or whether it had any assets. DMF No. 40;
Longarzo Decl. Ex. 1; Abbott Decl. Ex. 1 at 34:15-21, 43:35-44:21, 48:16-49:12;
Ex. 3 at 14:19-16:16, 41:12-20; 96:20-97:20; AMF. No. 3; Yu Decl. Ex. 1.
Plaintiff raises sufficient evidence to show a triable issue of material fact as
to whether Infrastructure is a successor-in-interest.
 
2.      Damages
 
Defendants argue the Allocation Letter says the tokens have
no value, which means there are no damages. Yu Decl. ¶11, Ex.
1 ¶8 (“To Rari Capital, the $RGT can be regarded as a valueless token that is
exclusively leveraged for governance and fee discount purposes.”)) However, the Allocation Letter also states: “These
$RGT are subject to the Rari Vesting Schedule which can be found here. The plan
lasts twenty-four months. As highlighted in the attached chart, you are free to
sell your tokens at any time. However, the sooner you sell, the more tokens you
will burn.” Yu
Decl. ¶11, Ex. 1 ¶4.
 
This mention of the merchantability of Yu’s allocated $RGT
indicates the parties understood the tokens had monetary value on a secondary
market. Paragraphs 4 and 8 of the Allocation Letter Yu Decl. ¶11, Ex. 1, when taken together, create the inference that although
Rari Capital can regard RGT as a “valueless token that is exclusively leveraged
for governance and fee discount purposes,” outside of Rari Capital’s
perspective, the RGT can be sold and purchased. And when sold, a RGT holder
(e.g., plaintiff) will “forfeit [their] right to participate in governance, fee
discounts, and any other perks with those given tokens.” Yu Decl. ¶11, Ex. 1 ¶4. The Allocation Letter allows a trier of fact to infer
that Rari Capital intended to convey monetary value to plaintiff. Since there
is an inference that RGT has some monetary value outside of Rari Capital’s
perspective, a breach of the Allocation Letter can cause plaintiff damages. Summary adjudication of the breach of contract claim is
DENIED.
 
(B)  Conversion
– against Rari Capital Infrastructure, LLC, Fei Labs, Inc., and Jack Longarzo
The elements for
conversion are: “(1) the plaintiff owned or had the right to possess the
personal property; (2) the defendant disposed of the property in a manner
inconsistent with the plaintiff’s property rights; and (3) resulting damages.” Berry
v. Frazier (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 1258, 1271. “It is not necessary that
there be a manual taking of the property; it is only necessary to show an
assumption of control or ownership over the property, or that the alleged
converter has applied the property to his own use.” (Oakdale Village Group
v. Fong (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 539, 544, as modified on denial of reh'g
(Apr. 10, 1996).) “[C]onversion is a strict liability tort. It does not
require bad faith, knowledge, or even negligence; it requires only that the
defendant have intentionally done the act depriving the plaintiff of his or her
rightful possession.” Voris v. Lampert (2019) 7 Cal.5th 1141, 1158. “[T]he law is well settled that there can be no conversion where an
owner either expressly or impliedly assents to or ratifies the taking, use or
disposition of his property.” Farrington v. A. Teichert & Son, Inc.
(1943) 59 Cal.App.2d 468, 474.
 
Defendants argue the conversion claim fails because plaintiff’s RGT
was transferred to TRIBE with his authorization. There can be no conversion
where an owner expressly or impliedly assents to or ratifies the taking of his
property. Id. The basis of a conversion action “rests upon the
unwarranted interference by defendant with the dominion over the property
of  the plaintiff from which injury to
the latter results.” Los Angeles Federal Credit Union v. Madatyan (2012)
209 Cal.App.4th 1383, 1387. Defendants maintain Yu exercised his opportunity to
vote on a merger of tokens and expressly authorized the conversion of his RGT
into TRIBE. Longarzo Decl. ¶23. Thus, defendants argue there can be no wrongful
taking when their actions merely effectuated a voted-on agreement expressly
authorized by plaintiff. Id. 
 
However, there is a dispute as to what occurred during the merger
of tokens from RGT to TRIBE. Both parties agree the “Merger Agreement states
RGT holders could ‘swap’ RGT for TRIBE (the Tribe governance token) at a fixed
conversion rate.” See, UMF No. 19. The Merger Agreement speaks for itself. They
disagree on whether Yu expressly authorized the conversion of his RGT to TRIBE.
Longarzo states “Plaintiff voted for, approved and expressly authorized the RGT-TRIBE
merger and the resulting swapping of his RGT for TRIBE.” Longarzo Decl. ¶23.
 
Plaintiff states (1) he did not vote to approve the merger, (2) he
voted to abstain, (3) he never elected to convert his RGT to TRIBE, and (4)
never consented to have his RGT put on a new vesting schedule. Yu Decl. ¶¶16-18.
Plaintiff states on May 29, 2022, Longarzo told him “Rari Infrastructure would
be clawing back previously allocated RGT held in the Vesting Contract,
including [Yu’s], in order to fund the hiring of new code developers. [Yu]
voiced [his] objection to the claw back of [his] RGT, but Longarzo insisted that
he would be taking 90 percent of [Yu’s] tokens.” Yu Decl. ¶25. Lastly,
plaintiff asserts “not only did Longarzo and Rari Infrastructure take and swap
my RGT without my knowledge or consent, but they also kept the TRIBE tokens
that my RGT were converted into. This left me with no RGT and no TRIBE.” Yu
Decl. ¶29.
 
Defendants did not meet their initial burden of showing a complete
defense to the cause of action of conversion. If, as plaintiff claims, he never
elected to or consented to convert his RGT for TRIBE, defendants kept the TRIBE
tokens, and he does not possess any RGT or TRIBE, then he may be able to prove
that he did not assent to the defendants’ taking of his RGT—whether it was
converted to TRIBE or clawed back. When viewing the facts and evidence in a
light most favorable to Yu, the nonmoving party, the court finds there remains
a triable issue of material fact. Accordingly, the motion for summary
adjudication on the cause of action of conversion is DENIED. 
 
(C)
Violation of Cal. Penal Code § 496 – against Rari
Capital Infrastructure, LLC, Fei Labs, Inc. and Longarzo 
 
A violation of
Penal Code section 496, receipt of stolen property, occurs when (1) defendant
buys, receives, sells, conceals, withholds, or aids in concealing or
withholding or selling property that had been stolen or obtained by extortion;
(2) defendant knew the property had been stolen or obtained by extortion; and
(3) defendant actually knew of the presence of the property. Pen. Code §496(a);
People v. Land (1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 220, 223. Theft is defined as one
“who shall fraudulently appropriate property which has been entrusted to him or
her, or who shall knowingly and designedly, by any false or fraudulent
representation or pretense, defraud any other person of money, labor or real or
personal property.” Pen. Code §484(a). Where a plaintiff proves defendant
obtained property in any manner constituting theft, a plaintiff “may bring an
action for three times the amount of actual damages, if any, sustained by the
plaintiff, costs of suit, and reasonable attorney’s fees.” Pen. Code §496(c).
 
Defendants assert the elements of section 496 have not been met
because there must be criminal intent, which plaintiff cannot prove. “[T]heft
by larceny requires a specific intent permanently to deprive the rightful owner
of his property. While the felonious intent of the party taking need not
necessarily be an intention to convert the property to his own use, still it
must in all cases be an intent to wholly and permanently deprive the owner
thereof.” People v. Kunkin (1973) 9 Cal. 3d 245, 251, citing People
v. Brown (1894) 105 Cal. 66, 69 (internal quotation marks omitted).
 
Defendants meet
the initial burden of proving the section 496 cause of action has no merit by presenting
material facts as to their lack of intent to affect plaintiff’s property. Defendants
assert Fei never had any intent to harm plaintiff. Grieco Decl. ¶16. Second, neither
Infrastructure nor Longarzo had intent to harm plaintiff. Longarzo Decl. ¶50. Third,
Fei never took any actions to affect any property of plaintiff, including plaintiff’s
cryptocurrency tokens, with the exception of writing the PegExchanger Contract,
which was later deployed by the TRIBE DAO, not by Fei Labs, Inc., and
authorized for use in a vote of TRIBE holders, including plaintiff, who voted
for such deployment—this indirectly affected plaintiff’s property, but not in
any wrongful or unauthorized way. Grieco Decl. ¶15. Lastly, use of the
PegExchanger Contract was expressly authorized by TRIBE holders and plaintiff. Grieco
Decl. ¶15. The foregoing material facts speak to defendants’ state of mind.
Defendants meet their initial burden.
 
In opposition, plaintiff submits evidence Longarzo expressly
conceded “at least 10% of the tokens seized rightfully belong to Yu, yet
Defendants took even that portion and have refused to return it.” Opposition,
p. 21; see Abbot Decl. Ex. 1 at 122:24-123:2, 148:3-13; see also Longarzo Decl.
¶28. After Longarzo is questioned “[s]o you agree that Justin was owed at least
ten percent of his original allocation?” during his deposition, Longarzo
answers “[y]es, that has been consistent for the past two years.” Abbot Decl.
Ex. 1 at 122:24-123:2. This can lead to an inference that the seizure of Yu’s
RGT was not accidental or inadvertent, and this evidence is sufficient to raise
triable issues of fact regarding defendants’ intent to deprive Yu of his
property. See Siry, supra, 13 Cal.5th at 362 (“[T]he record
appears consistent with a conclusion that defendants acted not innocently or
inadvertently, but with careful planning and deliberation reflecting the
requisite criminal intent” under Section 496.) 
 
Triable issues of fact remain unresolved, including whether defendants
acted with the requisite criminal intent during the taking of plaintiff’s RGT tokens.
Summary adjudication DENIED.
