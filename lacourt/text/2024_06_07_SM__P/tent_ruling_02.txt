additional disputed material facts as set forth in plaintiff’s opposing separate
statement, to which the defendants’ reply to plaintiff’s opposing separate
statement will state the defendants’ response and supporting evidence as
“undisputed,” “disputed,” “objection,” etc. For example, in AMF No. 1,
defendants’ response is only “Undisputed.”

In DMF No. 12,
defendants claim in December 2021, Rari Capital’s DAO merged into the TRIBE
DAO. Plaintiff disputes this Fact to the extent that the “merger” of the DAOS
was functionally a merger of Rari Capital and Fei Labs’ business activities. It
is otherwise undisputed that Rari Capital’s DAO merged into the TRIBE DAO.

 In DMF No. 31, defendants claim that Longarzo
explained to plaintiff that the two-year vesting schedule no longer applied and
that is why plaintiff was entitled to “approximately 10%” of the RGT he was
originally allocated. Plaintiff disputes this Fact to the extent that it
characterizes Yu’s entitlement to only 10 percent of his allocated RGT. It is
otherwise undisputed that on May 29, 2022, Longarzo and Yu spoke on the phone
regarding 90 percent of Yu’s RGT.
