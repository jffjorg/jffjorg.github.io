De Julio v. Tana,
Case No. 22SMCV01556
Hearing Date: June
6, 2024
Plaintiff’s Motion
to Strike Defendant’s Designation of Expert Witnesses
 
Plaintiffs move to strike defendant’s designation of
expert witnesses as untimely. The trial date was previously moved from 3/25/24
to 5/20/24, per defendant’s ex parte of 1/24/24. The minute order of that date stated
“all discovery deadlines are tied to the new trial date.”
Plaintiffs’ counsel stated he reached out to defense
counsel to confirm whether the previously-served demand for expert designation
would flow from the new (continued) trial date, which is what the court ordered
on 1/24/24. Plaintiffs’ counsel was unable to reach defense counsel and sent
out the designation on 2/5/24. Defendant served their expert witness
designation on 5/2/24, using the new trial date as the key from which the
designation date would flow, as per the court’s minute order. 
Plaintiffs now move to strike defendants’ experts on
the basis of untimely designation, arguing the timing was purposeful. Even were
the court to accepting all plaintiffs’ arguments, there has been no prejudice
to plaintiffs. This seems to be, at best, a misunderstanding between counsel. At
worst, the “misunderstanding” seems manufactured by plaintiffs’ counsel, as the
minute order of 1/24/24 specifically addresses this issue. It would be patently
unfair to strike defendants’ designation on these grounds, as the court has
discussed with counsel previously. 
Defendant opposes and seeks sanctions of $1,100. This
motion was without significant justification. Plaintiff could have withdrawn
this motion after the IDC or after the last hearing, when this motion was
discussed. Plaintiffs chose not to do so. The court declines to award
sanctions, however, as defense counsel did not respond to plaintiffs’ counsel’s
emails on this issue. Motion denied.
