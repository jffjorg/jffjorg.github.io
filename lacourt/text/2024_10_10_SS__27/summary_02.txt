And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for terminating sanctions filed by Plaintiff Darryl Adonis Murphy against Defendant Lukas Huynh and others. The motion is denied because it was filed late, without sufficient notice. The Judge notes that Defendant 123 Trucking's attorney, Mr. Bauer, recently filed a declaration stating that his mother passed away and he will be on bereavement leave, which may have caused the delay in responding to the motion. The Judge also observes that Plaintiff has withdrawn several motions around the same time, raising the question of whether there is an agreement between the parties to suspend court activities. The motion is denied, and the parties are advised to submit by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
