MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS
Hearing Date: 10/10/24¿ 
CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV30508 DARRYL ADONIS MURPHY vs LUKAS HUYNH,
et al.
Moving Party: Plaintiff
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient¿ 
Ruling: MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS IS DENIED

 
On September 19, 2022,
Plaintiff filed the present complaint. On February 1, 2024, Defendants,
including Defendant 12 Trucking LLC, filed their answers. On August 8, 2024,
the Court granted Plaintiff’s motions to compel initial responses from
Defendant 123 Trucking. Defendant was ordered to pay sanctions and provide
responses by September 9, 2024. However, no responses nor sanctions were
provided by the deadline. Plaintiff now moves the Court for terminating
sanctions, evidentiary sanctions, issue sanctions, and monetary sanctions
against Defendant. No opposition was filed.
The motion is untimely.
On September 16, 2024, Plaintiff served the motion electronically on Defendant.
The motion is to be heard 18 court days from the date of service (16 court days
under CCP 1005(b) plus 2 court days for electronic service under CCP 1010.6(a)(3)(B)).
18 court days from September 16, 2024, is October 11, 2024, but the motion is
set for October 10, 2024. The court denies the present motion as untimely.  
Furthermore, it does
not appear that Defendant 123 Trucking has abandoned its case. Mr. Bauer,
Defendant 123 Trucking’s attorney, recently filed a declaration stating that on
September 30, 2024, his mother passed away, and he will be on bereavement leave,
noting that he will prepare for trial upon his return. The lack of an
opposition and failure to provide discovery responses may be related to
counsel’s mother’s passing. Additionally, the Court observes that Plaintiff has
withdrawn numerous motions on calendar within this time frame, raising the
question of whether there is an agreement between the parties to suspend court
activities to accommodate Mr. Bauer’s bereavement leave. In any event, as noted
above, the motion is denied because it did not provide sufficient notice.
