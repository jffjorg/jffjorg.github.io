And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the settlement and finds it fair and reasonable. The judge also finds the attorney's fees fair and reasonable. However, the petition contains some minor deficiencies that need to be addressed. Specifically, the figures under Item 12a do not add up, and the entries under Item 12b(5) and the associated attachment do not equal $34,986.19. The judge is conditionally granting the petition, but only if the moving party files an amended application addressing these deficiencies at least 5 days prior to the new court date set for October 10, 2024, at 4:00 PM in Department 27. Failure to do so may result in sanctions.
