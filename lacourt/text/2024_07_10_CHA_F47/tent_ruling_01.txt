RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff Mankind Essentials, Inc.
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order striking
the Second Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Mankind Essentials, Inc. and
for sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel in the amount of
$4,042.50 pursuant to CCP 128.5. 
 
RULING: The motion is denied.  
 
SUMMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY  
 
This action arises out of an agreement entered into by former
plaintiffs Talal Altamimi, III (Altamimi) and Plaintiff Mankind Essentials,
Inc. (Mankind/Plaintiff) and Defendant Lief Organics, LLC (Defendant) for the
manufacture of fertility and dietary products for Mankind.  Based on three orders, Altamimi and Plaintiff
paid Defendant deposits totaling $22,787.50. 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to perform under the
agreement.  
 
On 8/11/23, Altamimi and Mankind filed this action
against Defendant for: (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Fraudulent Deceit, (3)
Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, (4) Promissory Fraud and
(5) Negligence.  After attempts to meet
and confer regarding the issues Defendant had with the complaint were
unsuccessful, on 11/20/23, Defendant filed and served a demurrer to the  original complaint.  On 12/28/23, 9 court days before the 1/11/24
hearing date on the demurrer, Plaintiff Mankind Essentials, Inc. (Plaintiff),
alone, filed and served a First Amended Complaint which rendered the demurrer
moot.  (See 1/11/24 Minute Order
citing CCP 472(a); CCP 1005(b)). 
 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the
issues Defendant had with the First Amended Complaint, pursuant to an extension
of time to respond to the First Amended Complaint, on 2/9/24, Defendant filed
and served a demurrer to the 2nd, 4th and 5th
causes of action in the First Amended Complaint.  On 3/7/24, the date a reply was due to be
filed and served, Defendant filed and served a Notice of Non-Opposition to the
demurrer.  See CCP 1005(b)  On that same date and without any
explanation, Plaintiff filed and served a late opposition to the demurrer.  On 3/8/24, Defendant filed and served a reply
to the opposition.  
 
On 3/14/24, the Court sustained the demurrer with 30 days
leave to amend making a Second Amended Complaint due on or before 4/15/24.  (See 3/14/24 Minute Order).  Plaintiff filed and served its Second Amended
Complaint on 5/2/24.
 
Thereafter, Defendant contacted Plaintiff regarding the
impropriety of filing the Second Amended Complaint beyond the deadline set by
the Court and asked Plaintiff’s counsel to withdraw the Second Amended
Complaint.  (Bamford Decl. ¶¶6-7,
Ex.C).  Plaintiff did not directly
respond to the request to withdraw the Second Amended Complaint and has not
withdrawn the pleading.  (Bamford Decl. ¶¶6-7).
 
On 5/28/24, Defendant filed and served the instant motion
seeking an order striking the Second Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff and
for sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel in the amount of
$4,042.50 pursuant to CCP 128.5.
 
At the 5/29/24 Case Management Conference, former
plaintiff Talal Altamimi represented that Plaintiff was no longer represented
by counsel, although a substitution of attorney had not been filed.  (See 5/29/24 Minute Order).  On 6/14/24, at the hearing on Defendant’s
Motion to Compel Arbitration, Plaintiff’s counsel represented that Plaintiff’s
counsel had substituted out; however, a substitution of attorney had still not
been filed.  (See 6/14/24 Minute
Order).  At the same hearing, defense
counsel represented to be in contact with Plaintiff; the parties had entered
into a settlement agreement and requested the hearing on the motion be
continued.  Id.  Therefore, the hearing on the motion to
compel arbitration was continued to 8/14/24. 
Id.
 
Despite the foregoing, on 7/2/24, Defendant filed a
Notice of Non-Opposition to the instant motion to strike.  Also, on 7/2/24, Plaintiff filed a substitution
of attorney indicating that former plaintiff, Talal Altamimi, is substituted in
as counsel for Plaintiff.  As noted on
the Substitution of Attorney form itself, unless Altamimi is an attorney,
Altamimi cannot represent the corporate Plaintiff in court.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendant seeks to strike the Second Amended Complaint on
the ground that it was “not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this
state, a court rule, or an order of the court” because it was filed beyond the
30-day deadline set forth in the Court’s 3/14/24 order sustaining Defendant’s
demurrer with 30 days leave to amend.  See
CCP 436(b).
 
Defendant also seeks sanctions against Plaintiff and
Plaintiff’s (former) counsel on the ground that the filing of the Second
Amended Complaint beyond the court ordered deadline constitutes frivolous
conduct.  See CCP 128.5.
 
While the Second Amended Complaint was filed and served
beyond the court-ordered deadline, Defendant has not shown that it has suffered
any prejudice as a result of the late filing and service.  Similarly, the Court does not find the late
filing and service of the Second Amended Complaint constitutes frivolous
conduct which warrants the imposition of sanctions.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is denied.  As noted above, unless Talal Altamimi is an
attorney, Altamimi cannot represent Plaintiff Mankind Essentials, Inc. in
court.  Therefore, Altamimi cannot appear
on behalf of Plaintiff at this hearing or any future hearing.  If Altamimi is not an attorney, Plaintiff  must obtain counsel before the next scheduled
court hearing or the Court will set an Order to Show Cause as to why the action
should not be dismissed.
