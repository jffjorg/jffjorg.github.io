BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff
Diego Alfredo Vicente Chay sues his former employer, Defendant Yen-Nhai, Inc.
dba Nathan Anthony Furniture, for alleged wage and hour violations. Defendant
is a luxury furniture and upholstery designer and manufacturer. Plaintiff seeks
to represent a class of Defendant’s current and former non-exempt employees. 
On
January 20, 2022, Plaintiff filed a class action complaint alleging causes of
action for: (1) Unpaid Overtime; (2) Unpaid Meal Period Premiums; (3) Unpaid
Rest Period Premiums; (4) Unpaid Minimum Wages; (5) Final Wages Not Timely
Paid; (6) Wages Not Timely Paid During Employment; (7) Failure to Provide
Accurate Wage Statements; (8) Failure to Reimburse Necessary Business Expenses;
(9) Violation of Business and Professions Code § 17200, et seq., and (10)
Private Attorney General Act, Labor Code § 2698, et seq.
            On February 2, 2023, the parties
attended a full day mediation before Eve Wagner, Esq., which resulted in
settlement. The terms of settlement are finalized in the long-form Class
Action and PAGA Settlement Agreement (“Settlement
Agreement”), a copy of which was filed with the Court on July 21, 2023.  
On
August 15, 2023, the Court issued a “checklist” to the parties pertaining to
deficiencies in the proposed settlement. In response, the parties filed further
briefing, including a revised Settlement Agreement on December 13, 2023. 
On
February 15, 2024, after the parties filed a further revised Settlement
Agreement to address concerns raised by the Court, preliminary approval of the
settlement was granted. All references below are to the agreement attached to
the Further Supplemental Declaration of Cody Payne filed February 8, 2024. 
Notice was given to
the Class Members as ordered (see Declaration of Jarrod Salinas (“Salinas Decl.”)).
Now before the Court is the
Motion for Final Approval of the settlement. 
 
SETTLEMENT
CLASS DEFINITION
 
·      
“Class” means all current and former non-exempt employees of Defendant within
the State of California at any time during the Class Period. (¶1.5)
·      
“Class
Period” means the period starting on and including January 20, 2018 up to and
including July 17, 2023. (¶1.12) 
·      
“Aggrieved
Employee” means all current and former non-exempt employees of Defendant in the
State of California at any time during the PAGA Period. (¶1.4) 
·      
“PAGA
Period” means the period starting on and including November 4, 2020 up to and
including July 17, 2023. (¶1.31) 
·      
“Participating
Class Member” means a Class Member who does not submit a valid and timely
Request for Exclusion from the Settlement. (¶1.35)
 
TERMS OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT
 
            The
essential terms are as follows:
·      
The Gross
Settlement Amount (“GSA”) is $400,000, non-reversionary.
(¶3.1)
o   Escalator Clause: The Gross Settlement Amount
is based on Defendant’s estimate that the Class Members worked a total of
10,000 Workweeks during the Class Period. If the actual number of Workweeks
encompassed within the Class Period increases by more than 10% [i.e., by more
than 11,000 workweeks], then Defendant shall increase the Gross Settlement
Amount by a pro-rata dollar value for the weeks in excess of the escalation
margin. For example, if the number of Workweeks increases by 11%, the Gross
Settlement Amount will increase by 1%. The Gross Settlement Amount plus any
applicable employer-side payroll taxes shall be the maximum amount Defendant is
required to pay under the Settlement. (¶8)
o   At final approval, the settlement
administrator represents that Participating Class Members worked a collective
total of 10,497 Workweeks during the Class Period. (Salinas Decl. ¶11.) Accordingly,
the escalator clause was not triggered. 
·      
The
Net Settlement Amount (“Net”) ($195,500) estimated at preliminary
approval is the GSA minus the following:
o   Up to $140,000
(35%) for
attorney fees (¶3.2.2); 
o   Up to $30,000 for litigation costs (Ibid.);

o   Up to $7,500 for a Service Payment to
the Named Plaintiff (¶3.2.1);
o   Up to $7,000 for settlement
administration costs (¶3.2.3); and
o   Payment of $20,000 PAGA penalty ($15,000
or 75% to the LWDA). (¶3.2.5)
·      
Defendant
will separately pay any and all employer payroll taxes owed on the Wage
Portions of the Individual Class Payments. (¶3.1)
·      
There
is no claim form requirement. (¶3.1)
·      
Individual Settlement Payment Calculation: Each
Participating Class Member will receive an Individual Class Payment calculated
by (a) dividing the Net Settlement Amount by the total number of Workweeks
worked by all Participating Class Members during the Class Period and (b)
multiplying the result by each Participating Class Member’s Workweeks. (¶3.2.4) Non-Participating Class Members will
not receive any Individual Class Payments. The Administrator will retain
amounts equal to their Individual Class Payments in the Net Settlement Amount
for distribution to Participating Class Members on a pro rata basis. (¶3.2.4.2)
o   PAGA Payments: The Administrator will
calculate each Individual PAGA Payment by (a) dividing the amount of the
Aggrieved Employees’ 25% share of PAGA Penalties ($5,000) by the total number
of PAGA Pay Periods worked by all Aggrieved Employees during the PAGA Period
and (b) multiplying the result by each Aggrieved Employee’s PAGA Pay Periods.
(¶3.2.5.1)
o   Tax Allocation: Participating Class Member’s Individual
Class Payments will be allocated as follows: 10% as wages, 90% as interest and
penalties. (¶3.2.4.1) The Administrator will report the Individual PAGA
Payments on IRS 1099 Forms. (¶3.2.5.2)
·      
Response Deadline: “Response Deadline”
means 60 days after the Administrator mails Notice to Class Members and
Aggrieved Employees, and shall be the last date on which Class Members may: (a)
fax, email, or mail Requests for Exclusion from the Settlement, or (b) fax,
email, or mail his or her Objection to the Settlement. Class Members to whom
Notice Packets are resent after having been returned undeliverable to the
Administrator shall have an additional 14 calendar days beyond the Response
Deadline has expired. (¶1.43) The same deadlines apply to the submission of
challenges to estimated payment amounts. (¶7.6) 
o  
Because future PAGA claims are subject to claim
preclusion upon entry of the Judgment, Non-Participating Class Members who are
Aggrieved Employees are deemed to release the claims identified in Paragraph
5.3 of this Agreement and are eligible for an Individual PAGA Payment. (¶7.5.4)
o  
If the number of valid Requests for Exclusion
identified in the Exclusion List exceeds 5% of the total of all Class Members, Defendant may, but is not obligated, elect to withdraw from the Settlement. (¶9) 
·      
Funding
of Settlement: The Gross Amount shall be paid in two payments. The first
payment of $200,000.00 of the Gross Settlement Amount shall be due within 30
days of the Effective Date or 12 months after mediation provided the Court
grants Final Approval and the Judgment is final as set forth in Paragraph 1.18,
whichever is later. The second payment of the remaining $200,000.00 of the
Gross Settlement Amount, as well as any and all employer payroll taxes owed on
the Wage Portions of the Individual Class Payments, shall be due within 7
months of the first payment. The Administrator shall hold the Gross Settlement
Amount or any portion of it in bank accounts insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation. The Administrator shall deposit the settlement payments
into federally insured bank accounts so that all money is insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (i.e., FDIC). (¶4.2)  
·      
Disbursement:
Within 7 days after Defendant funds the Gross Settlement Amount, the
Administrator will mail checks for all Individual Class Payments, all
Individual PAGA Payments, the LWDA PAGA Payment, the Administration Expenses
Payment, the Class Counsel Fees Payment, the Class Counsel Litigation Expenses
Payment, and the Class Representative Service Payment. Disbursement of the
Class Counsel Fees Payment, the Class Counsel Litigation Expenses Payment and
the Class Representative Service Payment shall not precede disbursement of
Individual Class Payments and Individual PAGA Payments. (¶4.3)
·      
Uncashed Settlement Checks: The face of each
check shall prominently state the date (not less than 180 days after the date
of mailing) when the check will be voided. The Administrator will cancel all
checks not cashed by the void date. (¶4.3.1) For any Class Member whose
Individual Class Payment check is uncashed and cancelled after the void date,
the Administrator shall transmit the funds represented by such checks to the
California Controller's Unclaimed Property Fund in the name of the Class Member
thereby leaving no "unpaid residue" subject to the requirements of
California Code of Civil Procedure Section 384, subd. (b).]. (¶4.3.3)
·      
The
settlement administrator will be Phoenix Settlement Administrators. (¶1.2)

Notice of
     Final Judgment will be posted on the Settlement Administrator’s website.
     (¶7.8.2) 
The
     proposed Settlement Agreement was submitted to the LWDA on February 8,
     2024. (Further Supp. Payne Decl. ISO Prelim, Exhibit 3.) 
Release of Claims. Effective on the date when Defendant fully funds
     the entire Gross Settlement Amount, Plaintiff,
     Class Members, and Class Counsel will release claims against all Released
     Parties as follows: (¶5)

Release by Participating
      Class Members: As of the date of the order granting Final Approval, and
      only after the Settlement has been fully funded by Defendant, all
      Participating Class Members (which specifically includes Plaintiff) shall
      fully and finally release Released Parties of the Released Class Claims.
      The “Released Class Claims” include any and all claims, wage and hour
      claims, rights, demands, liabilities and causes of action of any nature
      or description alleged/asserted in the Action arising from and/or related
      to the facts and claims alleged/asserted in the Action, that could have
      been alleged/asserted in the Action based on the facts and claims alleged
      in the Action, and the facts and claims asserted in, arising from or
      related to, or could have been alleged in the PAGA Notice submitted to
      the LWDA. (¶5.2) Upon entry of Judgment, Participating Class Members are
      precluded from filing a wage and hour action under the Fair Labor
      Standards Act against the Released Parties for claims and/or causes of action
      encompassed by the Released Class Claims which are extinguished and
      precluded pursuant to the holding in Rangel v. PLS Check Cashers of
      California, Inc., 899 F.3d 1106 (2018). This release excludes the release
      of claims not permitted by law. (Id.)
Release by Aggrieved
      Employees: As of the date of the order granting Final Approval, and only
      after the Settlement has been fully funded by Defendant, all Aggrieved
      Employees (which specifically includes Plaintiff) and the State of
      California shall fully and finally release Released Parties of the
      Released PAGA Claims. All Aggrieved Employees, including those who timely
      and effectively exclude themselves from the Class, shall nevertheless be
      bound by the Released PAGA Claims and shall receive an Individual PAGA
      Payment. Aggrieved Employees who timely and effectively exclude
      themselves from the Class shall have their Released PAGA Claims released
      only for the PAGA Period. The Released PAGA Claims include any and all
      claims asserted in the Action, and wage and hour claims, rights, demands,
      liabilities and causes of action of any nature or description arising
      from or related to the facts and claims alleged in the Action, or that
      could have been alleged in the Action based on the facts and claims
      alleged in the Action, and/or Plaintiff’s PAGA Notice submitted to the
      LWDA, including, without limitation, Labor Code sections 201, 202, 203,
      204, 210, 218, 221, 226, 226.3, 226.7, 510, 512, 558, 1174, 1174.5, 1194,
      1194.2, 1197, 1197.1, 1198, 1198.5, 1199, 2698 et seq., 2699, et seq.,
      2699.3, 2699.5, 2800, 2802, and the applicable Industrial Welfare
      Commission Wage Order(s). (¶5.3) 

“PAGA Notice” means Plaintiff’s November 4, 2021
       letter to Defendant and the LWDA providing notice pursuant to Labor Code

      affiliated companies, agents, managing agents, employees, servants,  officers, directors, owners (whether

      potential and/or alleged alter-egos, vendors, affiliated organizations,
      any person and/or entity with potential or alleged to have joint
      liability, and all of their respective past, present and future employees,
      directors, officers, members, owners, agents, representatives, payroll

ANALYSIS OF SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT
 
A.    
Does a presumption of fairness exist?  
The Court preliminarily found in its Order of
February 15, 2024 that the presumption of fairness should be
applied.  No facts have come to the
Court’s attention that would alter that preliminary conclusion.  Accordingly, the settlement is entitled to a presumption
of fairness as set forth in the preliminary approval order.
B.    
Is the settlement fair, adequate, and
reasonable?
The settlement was preliminarily found to be
fair, adequate and reasonable.  Notice
has now been given to the Class.  
  Reaction
of the class members to the proposed settlement. 
Number of class members: 151 (Salinas Decl. ¶3.)
Number of notice packets mailed: 151 (Id. at ¶5.) 
Number of undeliverable notices: 11 (Id. at ¶7.) 
Number of opt-outs: 1 (Id. at ¶8.)
Number of objections: 0 (Id. at ¶9.)
Number of participating class members: 150 (Id. at ¶11.)
Average individual payment: $1,388.80
(Id. at ¶15.)
Highest individual payment: $5,695.69 (Ibid.)  
The
Court finds that the notice was given as directed and conforms to due process
requirements.  Given the reactions of the
Class Members to the proposed settlement and for the reasons set for in the
Preliminary Approval order, the settlement is found to be fair, adequate, and
reasonable.
 
C.     Attorney Fees and Costs
            Class
Counsel requests an award of $140,000 (35%) in fees and $17,180.74
in costs. (MFA at 1:18-21.) The
Settlement Agreement provides for up to $140,000 (35%) of the GSA for attorney
fees and up to $30,000 in costs (¶3.2.2).

“Courts
recognize two methods for calculating attorney fees in civil class actions: the
lodestar/multiplier method and the percentage of recovery method.”  (Wershba
v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 224, 254.)  Here, class counsel
request attorney fees using the percentage method, as crosschecked by lodestar.
(MFA at pp. 9-18.) 
In
common fund cases, the Court may employ a percentage of the benefit method, as
cross-checked against the lodestar. (Laffitte
v. Robert Half Int’l, Inc. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 480, 503.) The fee request represents one-third of
the gross settlement amount, which is the average generally awarded in class
actions.  (See In re Consumer Privacy Cases (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 545, 558, fn.
13 [“Empirical studies show that, regardless whether the percentage method or
the lodestar method is used, fee awards in class actions average around
one-third of the recovery.”].)  
            Class
Counsel has provided information, summarized below, from which the lodestar may
be calculated: 



Firm

Hours


 


Totals




Payne Nguyen, LLP


$525


113.90


 


$59,797.50




Protection Law Group, LLP


$650

$62,790.00




Totals


 


207.1


 


$122,587.50



(Declaration of Cody Payne ISO Final ¶¶45-50;
Declaration of Heather Davis ISO Final ¶¶27-30, Exhibit 1.)
Counsel’s percentage-based fee request is higher
than the unadjusted lodestar, and would represent application of a multiplier
of approximately 1.14x. Notice of the fee request was provided to class members
in the notice packet and no one objected. (Salinas Decl. ¶9, Exhibit
A thereto.)
No facts are presented suggesting a fee award
at 35% of the GSA is appropriate. There is nothing to
suggest this case involved novel legal issues or particularly difficult facts.
Plaintiff’s counsel is experienced in wage and hour cases (see Payne
Decl. at ¶9, Davis Decl. at ¶9) and do not show they took any risk in excess of
that normally taken in any other contingent fee case of this type. 
Fees are instead set at 33 1/3% of the GSA or
$133,333.33, resulting in a multiplier of 1.09x, which is ample given
that the risks in this case are not shown to be any greater than any similar
contingent fee wage and hour case. 
Fee Split:
Attorneys’ fees awarded in this case will be split between Payne Nguyen, LLP
(40%), Protection Law Group, LLP (40%), and
Oracle Law Firm, APC (20%). Plaintiff gave
written approval and consent to this fee
splitting agreement on February 11, 2022. (Supp. Payne Decl. ISO Prelim ¶6.) 
 

            As
for costs, Class Counsel is requesting a cost amount of $17,180.74. This is less
than the $30,000 cap estimated at preliminary approval, which was disclosed to
Class Members in the Notice and not objected to. (Salinas Decl. ¶9, Exhibit A thereto.) Counsel’s costs include,
but are not limited to: Mediation ($9,950), Expert ($3,430), and Filing Fees ($2,270.83).
(Payne Decl. ISO Final, Exhibit 4; Davis Decl. ISO Final, Exhibit 2.) These
costs appear to be reasonable in amount and reasonably necessary to this
litigation. 
 
Based on the above, the Court
hereby awards $133,333.33 in fees
and $17,180.74 in costs.
D.    Incentive Award
The class representative, Diego
Alfredo Vicente Chay, seeks
an enhancement payment of $7,500 for his contributions to the action. (MFA
at 16:25-27.)  
In connection with the final fairness
hearing, named Plaintiffs must submit declarations attesting to why they should
be entitled to an enhancement award in the proposed amount.  The named Plaintiffs must explain why they
“should be compensated for the expense or risk he has incurred in conferring a
benefit on other members of the class.” 
(Clark v. American Residential Services LLC (2009) 175
Cal.App.4th 785, 806.)  Trial courts
should not sanction enhancement awards of thousands of dollars with “nothing
more than pro forma claims as to ‘countless’ hours expended, ‘potential stigma’ and ‘potential risk.’
Significantly more specificity, in the form of quantification of time and
effort expended on the litigation, and in the form of reasoned explanation of
financial or other risks incurred by the named plaintiffs, is required in order
for the trial court to conclude that an enhancement was ‘necessary to induce
[the named plaintiff] to participate in the suit . . . .’”  (Id.
at 806-807, italics and ellipsis in original.)
Plaintiff represents that his contributions
to this litigation include: meeting with his attorneys regarding the case,
discussing Defendant’s policies, practices, procedures and operations with
them, searching for documents for his attorneys, being available during
mediation, and reviewing the settlement. (Declaration of Diego
Alfredo Vicente Chay ISO
Final ¶¶6-10.) He does not provide an estimate of his time spent on the case.  
Based on the above,
as well as the benefits obtained on behalf of the class, the Court hereby grants
the enhancement payment in the reduced amount of $7,500 to Plaintiff.

E.    
Settlement Administration Costs
            The settlement
administrator, Phoenix Settlement Administrators, is requesting $7,000 for
the costs of settlement administration. (Salinas Decl. ¶16.) This equals
the cost of $7,000 estimated at preliminary approval (¶3.2.3) and disclosed to the Class on the Notice form,
to which there were no objections. (Salinas Decl. ¶9, Exhibit A
thereto.) Based on the above, the Court hereby awards administration costs in
the requested amount of $7,000.
 
 
THE PLAINTIFF IS ORDERED TO DOWNLOAD THE INSTANT SIGNED
ORDER FROM THE COURT’S WEBSITE AND TO GIVE NOTICE TO ALL OTHER PARTIES.
 
IT
IS SO ORDERED.
