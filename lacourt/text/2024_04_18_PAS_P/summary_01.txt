The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted, as there is no triable issue of material fact as to duty to warn or whether the alleged dangerous condition was open and obvious. The court finds that the plaintiff's harm was not foreseeable and that the plaintiff knew of the alleged dangerous condition.
