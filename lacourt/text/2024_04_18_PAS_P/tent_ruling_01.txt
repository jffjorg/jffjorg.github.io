  Case Number:  22AHCV00803    Hearing Date:   April 18, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT LINCOLN MOTEL’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENTI.        INTRODUCTION
          This is a personal injury case arising
from a fall at Defendant Lincoln Motel. Plaintiff Rick Eugene Lomas alleges that on May 21, 2021, he slipped and fell in his motel room. The
complaint contains two causes of action: (1) negligence and (2) premises
liability. 
          Before the Court is Defendant MO-OHMI Inc. dba Lincoln
Motel (Lincoln)’s unopposed motion for summary judgment, filed on December 15,
2023. No opposition has been filed as
of the time of posting this tentative. 
          Defendant Lincoln moves for summary judgment on the grounds
that: (1) it did not owe Plaintiff a duty to warn or fix the alleged dangerous
condition, (2) the alleged dangerous condition was open and obvious and (3) it
was not necessary for Plaintiff to encounter the alleged dangerous condition.
          The motion for summary judgment is granted.
II.      LEGAL
STANDARD
          Summary judgment is
appropriately granted where it is shown that an action has no merit or that
there is no defense to the action. (Code Civ. Proc. §437c(a).) A cause of
action has no merit if one of the following exists: (1) one or more necessary
elements cannot be established; (2) a defendant establishes an affirmative
defense. (CCP § 437c(o).)
          The
moving party bears the initial burden of production to make a prima facie
showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.¿ (Aguilar v.
Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 850.)¿ A defendant moving for
summary judgment must show either: (1) that one or more elements of the cause
of action cannot be established or (2) that there is a complete defense to that
cause of action.¿ (Code Civ. Proc. §437c(p).) A motion for summary judgment
should be granted where all the papers submitted show that there is no triable
issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a
matter of law. (CCP § 437c(c).)  
A defendant
has met “his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if
the party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action, even if
not separately pleaded, cannot be established, or that there is a complete
defense to the cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c(p)(2).) “[T]he burden
[then] shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a triable issue of one or
more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Id.)
To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion
must produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)
          Unopposed declarations must be accepted as true. (CCP §
437c(e).) However, affidavits must be liberally construed in favor of the
opposition and strictly construed against the moving party in determining the
existence of a "triable issue" of fact. (D'Amico v. Board of
Medical Examiners (1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 21.)
III. ANALYSIS
          A. Undisputed Material Facts 
Pursuant
to the separate statement, Plaintiff Rick Eugene Lomas alleges he slipped and
fell on May 21, 2021, in his room at the Lincoln Motel. (UMF 1.) Plaintiff alleges
he slipped because the floor had been mopped without warning. (UMF 3.) However,
Plaintiff allowed motel staff to mop his room and watched them mop. (UMFs 5-6.)
After staff left his room, Plaintiff slipped and fell. (UMF 7.) Plaintiff
alleges he was injured as a result. (UMF 8.) 
          B. Negligence or Premises Liability?
A negligence cause of action requires duty, breach
of the duty, causation, and damages. (Antiglio v. Corning, Inc. (1998)
Cal.4th 604,614.) In general, one does not have an affirmative duty to act
unless a “special relationship” exists between the defendant and plaintiff.
Special relationships include parent-child, doctor-patient, common-carriers,
and innkeepers. (Ericson v. Federal Express Corp. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th
1291, 1300.) Premises liability is a
specific form of negligence alleged against property owners. (See Brooks v.
Eugene Burger Management Corporation (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1611, 1619,
citations omitted.) 
Under
both causes of action, Plaintiff seeks redress for the same alleged negligence:
a wet floor in his motel room. (See Complaint p. 4-5.) Defendant Lincoln Motel
is a property owner.
          The Court concludes that the complaint is more properly
construed as one cause of action for premises liability. 
 
          C. Premises Liability
          Property owners have a duty to exercise reasonable care in
maintaining the premises to avoid exposing people to an unreasonable risk of
harm. (Id.) Property owners are not liable for “injury to an invitee
resulting from a danger which was obvious or should have been observed in the
exercise of reasonable care.” (Florez v. Groom Dev. Co. (1959) 53 Cal.2d
347, 355; see also Brown v. San Francisco Ball Club, Inc., 99 Cal.App.2d
484, 486 [holding that a government entity could not be held responsible for a
dangerous condition of its property because there was no evidence the entity
had notice of the dangerous condition.]) “To impose liability for injuries
suffered by an invitee due to the defective condition of the premises, the
owner or occupier ‘must have either actual or constructive knowledge of the
dangerous condition or have been able by the exercise of ordinary care to
discover the condition, which if known to him, he should realize as involving
an unreasonable risk to invitees on his premises.’” (Girvetz v. Boys’ Market
(1949) 91 Cal.App.2d 827, 829-830.) 
Citing
Jacobs v. Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage Company (2017) 14
Cal.App.5th 438, 447, Defendant urges that there is no liability for a
dangerous condition that is so open and obvious that the condition itself is a
warning. (See Jacobs v. Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage Company
(2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 438, 447, internal citations omitted [“[g] enerally, if a danger
is so obvious that a person could reasonably be expected to see it, the
condition itself serves as a warning, and the landowner is under no further
duty to remedy or warn of the condition.”]) 
Here,
Defendant urges that Plaintiff knew of the alleged dangerous condition, citing
Plaintiff’s discovery responses. (Motion p. 10.) In his response to Special
Interrogatory 53, Plaintiff states “Responding Party slipped and fell on a
slippery floor that had just recently been cleaned, mopped and/or waxed by
Defendant’s employees and/or staff.” ( See, e.g., Defendant’s Evidence Exh. C.
p. 30-highlighted text.) At deposition, Plaintiff testified “the ladies that
come in, they clean the room, they knocked on the door, and I let them in” and
that he saw the cleaning ladies mop the floor. (Defendant’s Evidence Exh. D.
p.44: 12-14, p. 50: 16-23.)  
Defendant
urges that because Lomas saw the staff mopping, the danger of a wet floor was obvious,
and Lomas could reasonably be expected to see the wet floor. (See Memorandum of
Points and Authorities p. 6: 6-13.) Lomas was aware of the alleged dangerous
condition. (UMFs 5-6.) Because Lomas knew the floor was recently mopped, Lincoln
did not have a duty to warn Lomas of the wet floor. (Knight v. Contracting
Engineers Co. (1961) 194 Cal.App.2d 435, 447.)
Without
evidence demonstrating a triable issue of material fact as to duty to warn, the
cause of action for premises liability cannot be established.
Alternatively,
Lincoln urges that because Lomas observed the staff mopping, the wet floor was
an open and obvious dangerous condition. (UMFs 5,6.) Generally, if the
dangerous condition is open and obvious, there is no liability. Only if the
eventual harm was foreseeable can there be liability. (See Osborn v. Mission
Ready Mix (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 104, 121-122 [necessity of Plaintiff
encountering the harm made the injury foreseeable]; Danieley v. Goldmine Ski
Assocs. (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 111, 122.)
          Defendant urges that Plaintiff’s injury was not foreseeable.
Defendant urges that “PLAINTIFF could have simply waited outside his Motel Room
until the floor dried. Alternatively, PLAINTIFF could have carefully walked
into his Motel Room and sat on the bed or sat in a chair at his desk until the
floor dried.” (Memorandum of Points and Authorities p. 7: 7-9.) Defendant cites
Miller v. Desilu Productions, Inc. (1962) 204 Cal.App.2d 160, 164-165,
internal citations omitted, for the proposition that “there is no obligation to
protect the invitee against dangers which are known to him, or which are so
apparent that he may reasonably be expected to discover them and be fully able
to look out for himself.”
          The Court finds that no triable issue of material fact
exists as to duty to warn. As duty to warn is an element of premises liability,
summary judgment is appropriate. Alternatively, the wet floor was an open and
obvious condition for which Plaintiff’s harm was not foreseeable. 
The
Court grants summary judgment.
IV.     CONCLUSION
          Defendant Lincoln Motel’s motion for summary judgment is granted.
