MOTION
              Defendant
PNPLXPRESS, Inc. (“Defendant”) moves to compel arbitration of the claims
Plaintiffs Anna Vocino and Alfred Loren Tarquino (“Plaintiffs”) assert against it.  Defendant’s notice of motion
indicates Defendant filed a memorandum of points and authorities and submitted declarations
from Jaime Ortega and Mainak D’Attaray in support of its motion.  These documents are not included among the
documents filed in this action.    
The Court cannot
grant a motion without a memorandum of points and authorities, as such a motion
is incomplete.  (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1112(a), (b).)  Accordingly, the Court will
continue the motion and give Defendant the opportunity to file its memorandum
of points and authorities and declarations in support of it.  The Court does not authorize Defendant to file
any additional pleadings related to its motion to compel other than those documents
noted above.
Defendant is ordered to provide notice of
this order and to file proof of service of same.
