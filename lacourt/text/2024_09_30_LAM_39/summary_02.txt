And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting plaintiff Krystal Tivis' motion to compel defendants Chris Khatchaturian, Albert Zargarian, and Vanessa Sanderson, as well as deponents Anthony Adams and Jasmine Triche, to testify at deposition and produce documents. The judge finds that the defendants are parties to the action and must comply with the deposition notices. The judge also notes that the deponents are employees of the parties to the action and must appear for deposition. The judge rejects the defendants' arguments that the deposition notices are overbroad and that the plaintiff failed to informally resolve the matter. The judge orders the deponent to appear for deposition within 30 days of notice of this order, unless the plaintiff stipulates otherwise. The judge also orders the plaintiff to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service.
