And here is a summary in English text:

The Honorable Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 21STCV11917A, addressing a motion to compel deposition notices served by Plaintiff Krystal Tivis. The motion seeks to compel Defendants Khatchaturian & Zargarian DDS, Inc., Sanderson & Khatchaturian Dental Corp., Zaragarian & Khatchaturian Dental Corp., and Smile Dental Group to produce persons most knowledgeable for deposition and produce documents. The Court finds that the Defendants are obligated to produce their persons most knowledgeable and documents, as they are parties to the action. However, the motion is premature with respect to Defendant Zaragarian & Khatchaturian Dental Corp., as Plaintiff did not notice the deposition of that entity. The Court grants the motion as to the other three Defendants and orders them to produce their persons most knowledgeable for deposition within 30 days. Additionally, the Court imposes sanctions of $2,660 against the three Defendants and their counsel, Ballard Rosenburg Golper & Savitt, LLP, for their abuse of the discovery process.
