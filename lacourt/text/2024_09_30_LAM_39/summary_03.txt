And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer to a first amended complaint filed by Plaintiffs Edmund Negrete and Fernando Negrete against Defendant United Convalescent Facilities, Inc. The demurrer challenges the second and third causes of action in the complaint.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the second cause of action, which alleges dependent adult abuse. The judge finds that Plaintiffs have adequately alleged a claim for dependent abuse, despite Defendant's argument that Plaintiffs fail to allege intentional abuse.

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action, which alleges willful misconduct. The judge finds that Plaintiffs have not alleged specific facts to support their claim of willful misconduct, and therefore, the demurrer is sustained with leave to amend.

The judge has granted Defendant's motion to strike the prayers for punitive damages and for attorney fees. The judge finds that Plaintiffs have not alleged specific facts to support their claim for punitive damages, and therefore, the prayer for punitive damages is stricken with leave to amend.

The judge has ordered Plaintiffs to file an amended complaint within 10 days, and Defendant is ordered to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
