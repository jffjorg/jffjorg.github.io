And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel further discovery responses and to compel further responses to requests. The plaintiff, CC Wellness, Inc., has moved to compel further responses to its requests for production and the defendant, Virahealth Medical Wholesale, has moved to compel further responses to its requests.

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion in part and denied it in part. The plaintiff seeks further responses to its requests for production numbers 3-5, 7, 9, 10, and 25, but the judge has found that the defendant's responses are adequate and complete. The plaintiff also seeks further responses to its requests for production numbers 16 and 17, which seek financial statements for the previous five years, but the judge has limited the requests to statements related to sales of products from the missing shipment from May 2022 to present.

The defendant has moved to compel further responses to its requests for production numbers 13 and 14 and form interrogatory 8.4, which seek the plaintiff's lost revenues and goodwill. The judge has denied the defendant's motion, finding that the plaintiff's financial information is proprietary and that the plaintiff is only seeking damages for the defendant's "ill-gotten gains" from the sale of products from the missing shipment.

The judge has ordered the defendant to provide further responses to the plaintiff's requests within 20 days of the order. The judge has also denied the defendant's motion to compel further responses to its requests.
