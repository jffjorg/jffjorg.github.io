And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled on the motions to compel further responses filed by the plaintiff (CC Wellness, Inc.) and the defendant (Virahealth Medical Wholesale). The plaintiff's motion is granted in part and denied in part. The court has ordered the defendant to provide further responses to requests Nos. 16 and 17, which seek financial statements for the previous five years, but only in relation to sales of products from the missing shipment from May 2022 to the present. The court has also ordered the defendant to provide a further response to request No. 29, which seeks the identities of the defendant's officers, managers, and members. The defendant's motions to compel further responses to its own requests are denied. The plaintiff's motion to compel is denied in part because the court has no evidence that the defendant is withholding documents. The defendant is ordered to provide further responses within 20 days of this order.
