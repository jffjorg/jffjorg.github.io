And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jane Doe, Giselle, Belgyn, and Kiani against the Los Angeles Unified School District and Hector Rodriguez. The case involves allegations of sexual abuse by Rodriguez, a former teacher at Orchard Academy, and the school district's knowledge or lack thereof. The plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to Requests for Production is granted, and the plaintiff's request for sanctions is denied. The defendant's motion to be relieved as counsel is pending, and the judge will hear arguments from counsel regarding this motion.

The plaintiff seeks to compel production of remaining class rosters and student information from 2011 to 2017, which may contain the identities of other students who were abused. The defendant produced some class rosters with redacted student information, but the plaintiff argues that this is not sufficient. The judge agrees with the plaintiff and orders the defendant to produce the remaining class rosters with student information.

The defendant's motion to be relieved as counsel is based on an alleged breakdown in attorney-client communication. The judge is unable to determine whether good cause exists for the defendant's motion without hearing further arguments from counsel.

The judge will also hear from the defendant's counsel regarding their motion to be relieved as counsel, as the court is unable to determine whether good cause exists for the withdrawal based on the current declaration.
