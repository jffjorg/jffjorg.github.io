And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiff's Motion to Compel, requiring Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) to produce class rosters with students' last names and dates of birth from 2011 to 2017. The court also denies Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions. The judge notes that there are important privacy interests at issue, but finds that Plaintiff's discovery rights and inability to obtain the evidence by other means override these concerns.

The judge also addresses Defendant's Motion to be Relieved as counsel, stating that the court is unable to determine whether good cause exists for withdrawal based on the current declaration. The court will hear from Defendant's counsel regarding his motion and may consider a supplemental declaration or additional evidence.

The case involves allegations of sexual abuse of a minor by Defendant's former employee, Hector Rodriguez, and Plaintiff's claims that Defendant knew or should have known about the abuse but failed to prevent it. The case has been ongoing since 2018, and Plaintiff opposes a continuance.
