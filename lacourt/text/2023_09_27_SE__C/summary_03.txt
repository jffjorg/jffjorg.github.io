The judge has denied the motion.

The judge found that the defendant had met its burden and that the statement made by Portillo to Evangelista was privileged. The judge cited case law, including Soltani-Rastegar v. Superior Court (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 424, to support its decision. The judge also overruled plaintiff's objections Nos. 1-6.
