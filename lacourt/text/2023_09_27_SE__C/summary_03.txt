## English Text Summary

The judge is considering a motion by Plaintiff Omar Macedo to compel Defendant Charter Communications, Inc. to provide further documents.  Macedo argues that a report by Evangelista, Portillo's supervisor, containing Portillo's statement about an incident should not be protected by attorney-client privilege. The judge disagrees, finding that the report was created in the course of Portillo's employment and intended for an attorney to defend against potential claims. The judge cites case law supporting this conclusion and denies Macedo's motion.
