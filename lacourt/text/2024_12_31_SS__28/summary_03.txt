The judge is considering a motion to continue the trial from February 10, 2025 to September 10, 2025, and to continue all trial-related dates. The District, the defendant, argues that the plaintiff has delayed in serving discovery responses, has not provided available dates for depositions, and has objected to the depositions of the plaintiff and his guardian ad litem. The District also plans to seek an independent medical examination of the plaintiff and its counsel has scheduling conflicts. The judge finds good cause and grants the motion in part, continuing the trial to March 12, 2025 or the next available date. The final status conference, discovery, and related dates and deadlines will be based on the new trial date.
