 Case Number:  23STCV16574    Hearing Date:   December 31, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On July
14, 2023, Plaintiff Shivam Patwari (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants
Dean Guaraldi (“Dean Guaraldi”), Jared Guaraldi (“Jared
Guaraldi”), and Does 1-100 for motor vehicle negligence, negligence per se -
Vehicle Code, § 22350, basic speed law, negligent infliction of emotional distress,
and negligent entrustment. 
On
June 11, 2024, Jared Guaraldi filed an answer. 
On
November 15, 2024, Jared Guaraldi and Dean Guaraldi filed (1) a
motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to demand for inspection, set two, and
for sanctions and (2) a motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to special
interrogatories, set two, and for sanctions.  However, Dean Guaraldi has not filed an answer to Plaintiff's complaint.  Therefore, the Court will treat the motions as having been filed by Jared Guaraldi ("Defendant"). 
The motions were set for hearing on December 13, 2024.  The Court continued the motions to December 31,
2024.  Plaintiff has not filed
oppositions. 
PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Defendant asks the Court to compel Plaintiff’s responses to demand for inspection and
production of documents, set two, and special interrogatories, set two, and to
impose sanctions on Plaintiff. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Inspection demand 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.300 provides: 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
following rules shall apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to the demand,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under
Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve
that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230,
2031.240, and 2031.280. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party making the demand may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. 
“(c) Except as provided in subdivision (d), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order compelling
a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(d) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (c), absent
exceptional circumstances, the court shall not impose sanctions on a party or
any attorney of a party for failure to provide electronically stored
information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as a result of
the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300.) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If
a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) 
DISCUSSION 
On September 19, 2024, Defendant served demand for inspection
and production of documents, set two, and special interrogatories, set two, on Plaintiff.  Plaintiff did not provide timely responses
and had not provided responses by the time Defendant filed these motions on November
15, 2024. 
The
Court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to demand for inspection
and production of documents, set two, and orders Plaintiff to serve code-compliant
verified responses without objections by January 30, 2025 and to produce the
documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested
without objections by January 30, 2025. 
The
Court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to special
interrogatories, set two, and orders Plaintiff to serve code-compliant verified
responses to the special interrogatories without objections by January 30, 2025. 
Defendant asks the Court to impose sanctions on Plaintiff on both motions. Under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and
2031.300, the Court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response
to interrogatories or a demand for inspection unless the Court finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c)
[interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (c) [demand for inspection].) 
Plaintiff
did not make or oppose a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or a
demand for inspection. Therefore, sanctions are not available under Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300. 
Other
statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,
authorize a sanctions award for these motions. 
In City of Los Angeles v. Pricewaterhousecoopers, LLP (2024) 17
Cal.5th 46 (PwC), the Supreme Court held: “It is already
well-established that a court may not rely on [Code of Civil Procedure] section
2023.030 to override the limitations prescribed by any other applicable
sanctions provision in the Act. A court may invoke its independent authority to
impose sanctions under sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 only when confronted with
an unusual form of discovery abuse, or a pattern of abuse, not already
addressed by a relevant sanctions provision. And where it invokes that
authority, it is constrained by the long-settled rules generally governing the
imposition of discovery sanctions under the Act.”  (PwC, supra, 17 Cal.5th at pp.
74-75.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290, subdivision (c), and 2031.300,
subdivision (c), limit the Court’s authority to impose sanctions when (as here)
the non-moving party does not oppose a successful motion to compel responses to
interrogatories or inspection demands. 
Because these statutes address this issue, the Court will not invoke its
independent authority to impose sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure
sections 2023.010 and 2023.030.  (See PwC,
supra, 17 Cal.5th at pp. 74-75.) 
Defendant also cites California Rule of Court, rule 3.1348(a), which provides: “The court
may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a
motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed .
. . .”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
1348(a).)  Because rule 3.1348(a)
authorizes sanctions “under the Discovery Act,” the Court may not award
sanctions under rule 3.1348(a) except as the Discovery Act authorizes.  As explained, the Discovery Act does not
authorize sanctions for Defendants’ unopposed motion to compel responses to
requests for production and interrogatories. 
Therefore, the Court denies Defendant’s request for sanctions. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Defendant Jared
Guaraldi's motion to
compel Plaintiff Shivam Patwari’s
responses to demand for inspection and production of documents, set two.  The Court orders Plaintiff Shivam Patwari to
serve code-compliant verified responses without objections by January 30, 2025
and to produce the documents, electronically stored information, and/or other
things requested without objections by January 30, 2025. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Jared Guaraldi's motion to
compel Plaintiff Shivam Patwari’s responses to special interrogatories, set
two, and orders Plaintiff Shivam Patwari to serve code-compliant verified
responses to the special interrogatories without objections by January 30, 2025. 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Jared Guaraldi's requests for sanctions. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
