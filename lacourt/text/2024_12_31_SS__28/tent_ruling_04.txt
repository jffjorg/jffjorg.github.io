 Case Number:  23STCV08608    Hearing Date:   December 31, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On April
18, 2023, Plaintiff Lusine Simonyan (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Mickys West Hollywood and Does 1-20 for battery, assault, false imprisonment,
negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
On
August 18, 2023, Defendant Mickys West Hollywood filed an answer. 
On
July 2, 2024, W.H.B.T., Inc. dba Micky’s West Hollywood
(erroneously sued and served as Mickys West Hollywood) (“Micky’s”) filed a
cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants USPA Southern California LLC (“USPA”)
and Roes 1-20 for equitable indemnity and contribution. 
On
September 13, 2024, the clerk entered USPA’s default on Micky’s cross-complaint. 
On
October 11, 2024, the Court found that this case (case number 23STCV08608) and
case number and case number 23STCV08740 are related within the meaning of
California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a). 
Case number 23STCV08608 became the lead
case.  The cases were assigned to
Department 28 at the Spring Street Courthouse for all purposes. 
On
October 30, 2024, Micky’s filed an application for extension of time to request
default judgment.  The application was
set for hearing on December 31, 2024. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for April 15, 2025. 
PARTY’S REQUEST         
Micky’s
asks the Court to extend the time for requesting default judgment against
USPA. 

LEGAL STANDARD 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.110(h), provides: 
“When a default is entered, the party who requested
the entry of default must obtain a default judgment against the defaulting
party within 45 days after the default was entered, unless the court has
granted an extension of time. The court may issue an order to show cause why
sanctions should not be imposed if that party fails to obtain entry of judgment
against a defaulting party or to request an extension of time to apply for a
default judgment within that time.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.110(h).) 
          Rule 3.110(h) “does not specify the grounds or procedure
for obtaining an extension of time for requesting . . . entry of default
judgment.”  (L. Edmon & C. Karnow,
Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2024) ¶ 5:16.6, p.
5-5.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Micky’s argues that it cannot seek default judgment on its
cross-complaint against USPA for equitable indemnity and contribution until Micky’s
liability to Plaintiff, if any, is determined. 
Micky’s therefore asks the Court to extend the deadline for Micky’s to request default judgment against USPA until after the trial. 
          The Court finds good cause and grants Micky’s application.  The Court extends the deadline for Micky’s
to request default judgment against USPA to May 15, 2025. 
CONCLUSION  The
Court GRANTS the application of Defendant and Cross-Complainant W.H.B.T., Inc.
dba Micky’s West Hollywood (erroneously sued and served as Mickys West
Hollywood) to extend the deadline to request entry of default judgment against
Cross-Defendant USPA Southern California
LLC to May 15, 2025.
