Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. Plaintiff Shivam Patwari filed an action against defendants Jared Guaraldi and Dean Guaraldi, but Dean Guaraldi has not filed an answer. Defendant Jared Guaraldi filed a motion to compel Plaintiff's responses to demand for inspection and production of documents, set two, and for sanctions, as well as a motion to compel responses to special interrogatories, set two, and for sanctions. The court has granted both motions, ordering Plaintiff to serve code-compliant verified responses to the demands without objections by January 30, 2025, and to produce the documents, electronically stored information, and/or other things requested without objections by January 30, 2025. The court has also denied Defendant's request for sanctions, as the statutes governing sanctions do not authorize sanctions for unopposed motions to compel responses to requests for production and interrogatories.
