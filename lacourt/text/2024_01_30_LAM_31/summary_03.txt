And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the demurrer filed by Defendant Susan Florence Scalzo to each cause of action in the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiff Celeste M. Mulrooney. The Court has determined that the demurrer to the Second Cause of Action for Breach of Contract is overruled, as the FAC sufficiently alleges part performance of the oral agreement. The Court has also overruled the demurrer to the First Cause of Action for Partition, finding that Plaintiff has standing to seek partition and that the claim is not barred by the Statute of Frauds. The demurrer to the Third Cause of Action for Fraud is also overruled, as the FAC adequately alleges the elements of fraud. The demurrer to the Fourth Cause of Action for Common Counts is overruled, as the FAC sufficiently alleges the elements of a common counts claim. The demurrer to the Fifth Cause of Action for Declaratory Relief is sustained, as the claim is duplicative of the other causes of action and involves only past wrongs. The Court has denied Plaintiff's request for leave to amend. Defendant is ordered to file and serve her Answer to the FAC within 10 days of this order.
