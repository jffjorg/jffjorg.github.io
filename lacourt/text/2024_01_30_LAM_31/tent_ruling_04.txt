[1] Defendant cites three additional
cases in her Reply in support of the proposition that part performance requires
exclusive possession.  Defendant
mischaracterizes two of the cases—Robison v. Hanley (1955) 136
Cal.App.2d 820 and Prince v. Varona (1956) 144 Cal.App.2d 673.  Neither case involved a plaintiff taking exclusive
possession of property.  Indeed, the
nature of the plaintiff’s possession in Robison and Prince, respectively,
is not discussed.  The third case, Sutton
v. Warner (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 415, involved tenants who rented a house
from Warner, plaintiffs’ landlord.  The
parties later entered into an oral agreement that provided the Suttons with the
option to purchase the home.  The issue
in Sutton was not exclusive possession of the property but rathe whether
the plaintiffs’ continued possession precluded part performance.  
 


[2] Defendant also argues the “facts alleged
do not unequivocally relate to an alleged oral ownership agreement and are more
reasonably seen as rent or an expense-sharing agreement siblings.”  (Mot., p.7:4-5.)  In support, Defendant cites  American Casualty Co. v. Curran Productions,
Inc. (1963) 212 Cal.App.2d 386 (American Casualty).  American Casualty is inapplicable
here.  American Casualty arose
from the granting of a summary judgment. 
Defendant’s argument ignores the well-settled rules of liberal
construction of pleadings in favor of the non-demurring party.


[3] Given the court’s ruling re: part
performance, the court does not address Plaintiff’s equitable arguments.


[4] “A life estate is an estate whose
duration is limited to the life of the person holding it or of some other
person.”
(Peterson
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 844, 850–51, citing Estate
of Smythe (1955 132 Cal.App.2d 343, 345-346.)
 


[5] Plaintiff requests judicial notice
of an alleged on-going contractual relationship between the parties.  The request is not in proper form nor is it
relevant to the court’s ruling.
