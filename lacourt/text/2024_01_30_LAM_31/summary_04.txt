And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the arguments presented by both parties and has reached a tentative ruling. The Defendant has cited several cases in support of the proposition that part performance requires exclusive possession, but the Court has found that two of these cases, Robison v. Hanley and Prince v. Varona, were mischaracterized by the Defendant. The Court has also rejected the Defendant's argument that the alleged oral ownership agreement is merely a rent or expense-sharing agreement, as this ignores the well-settled rules of liberal construction of pleadings in favor of the non-demurring party.

Given the Court's ruling on part performance, it does not address the Plaintiff's equitable arguments. The Court has also granted the Plaintiff's request for judicial notice of an alleged on-going contractual relationship between the parties, but notes that this request was not in proper form and is not relevant to the Court's ruling.

The Court has also considered the definition of a life estate, as provided in Peterson v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
