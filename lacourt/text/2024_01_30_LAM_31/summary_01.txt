And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel arbitration of individual PAGA claims. The motion was filed by the defendant, V.F. Corporation, and seeks to compel arbitration of the plaintiff's individual PAGA claims. The plaintiff, Diana Gonzalez, opposes the motion, arguing that the arbitration agreement does not apply to individual PAGA claims and that the motion is an impermissible wholesale waiver of the right to bring a PAGA action in court.

The judge has ruled in favor of the defendant, finding that the arbitration agreement applies to individual PAGA claims and that the motion is not an impermissible wholesale waiver of the right to bring a PAGA action in court. The judge has also ordered that the action be stayed pending the conclusion of the arbitration.

The judge's ruling is based on the following facts: the plaintiff was employed by the defendants as a logistics specialist and filed a class action lawsuit for recovery of unpaid wages and penalties; the parties entered into an employment agreement with an arbitration clause; and the arbitration agreement does not apply to representative PAGA claims.

The judge's decision is supported by the following laws and case citations: the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA), the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), California Labor Code, California Code of Civil Procedure, Business and Professions Code, Viking River Cruises, Inc. v. Moriana (2022) 596 U.S. 639, Adolph v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (2023) 14 Cal.5th 1104, Iskanian v. CLS Transportation Los Angeles (2014) 59 Cal.4th 348, Correira v. NB Naker Electric, Inc.
