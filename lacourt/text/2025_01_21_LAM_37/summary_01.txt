And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) is sustained with leave to amend. The plaintiff, John Corella, is suing the defendant, Jeffrey Collins, for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and other claims related to their joint venture agreement for the TV show "Dance Moms." The judge has granted the plaintiff 10 days to amend the FAC and has set an Order to Show Cause (OSC) for February 13, 2025, to address the amended complaint. The judge has also continued the Case Management Conference, originally scheduled for January 30, 2025, to February 13, 2025. The judge has ruled that the plaintiff's breach of fiduciary claim is time-barred, but has left open the possibility that the plaintiff may be able to amend the complaint to plead new facts that would revive the claim.
