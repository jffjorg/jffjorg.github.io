And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Los Indios de San Gabriel, Inc. and Andrew Salas, have moved for an order continuing the trial and final status conference in this case, which are currently set for October 16, 2024. The defendants' counsel is expected to be engaged in trial in another matter through October 2024 and is therefore unavailable to appear at the scheduled trial. The court has found good cause to grant a short continuance of the trial and final status conference and has ordered the trial continued to January 29, 2025, and the final status conference continued to January 16, 2025. The court has not extended the discovery cutoff and discovery motion cutoff dates, and all deadlines for the exchange of information concerning expert trial witnesses will remain based on the original date of May 15, 2024.
