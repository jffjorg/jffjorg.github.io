  Order RE:
 
defendants’ motion for order continuing
  trial and final status conference
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:              Defendants Los Indios de San
Gabriel, Inc., and Andrew Salas  
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Motion for Order Continuing Trial and Final Status Conference 
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed.
DISCUSSION
Defendants Los Indios de San Gabriel, Inc., and Andrew Salas
(“Defendants”) move the court for an order continuing trial and the final
status conference in this matter, both set for October 16, 2024, to January
2025.[1]  Defendants move for this relief on the ground
that their counsel is anticipated to be engaged in trial in another matter
through October 2024.  (Lopez Decl., ¶
9.)  Neither plaintiff Emilio Reyes nor
any other defendants have filed an opposition to this motion. 
The court finds good cause to grant a short continuance of trial and
the final status conference in this case because of Defendants’ counsel’s
unavailability to appear at trial set to begin on October 16, 2024.  (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1332, subds. (c)(3),
(d)(9), (d)(11).)
The court therefore grants defendants Los Indios de San Gabriel, Inc.,
and Andrew Salas’s motion to continue trial and the final status
conference.  The court orders:
1.    
The trial in this action is continued from
October 16, 2024, to January 29, 2025, at 11:00 a.m., in Department 53.
2.    
The Final Status Conference is continued from
October 16, 2024, to January 16, 2025, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 53.
3.    
The discovery cutoff and discovery motion cutoff
dates are not extended by this continuance.  All discovery cutoff and discovery motion
cutoff dates, and the deadlines for the exchange of information concerning
expert trial witnesses, shall be based on May 15, 2024, which is the date
initially set for trial of this action.
            The court orders defendants Los
Indios de San Gabriel, Inc., and Andrew Salas to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  October 9, 2024
