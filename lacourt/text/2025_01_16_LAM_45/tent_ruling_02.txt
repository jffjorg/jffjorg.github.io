BACKGROUND
 
This case was an employment action alleging whistleblower
and Fair Employment and
Housing Act (FEHA)-based discrimination claims. 
 
On April 1, 2016, Plaintiff Kariavandan Raju (Plaintiff)
initiated the instant action.
 
On September 28, 2018, Plaintiff filed a second amended
complaint. 
 
On December 13, 2019, Plaintiff filed a third amended
complaint (3AC) against Defendants County of Los Angeles (County) and Department
of Mental Health (Mental Health) (collectively, Defendants), alleging causes of
action for (1) Whistleblower Retaliation, (2) Retaliation for Complaining about
Unlawful Discrimination, (3) Failure to Prevent Discrimination, (4) Failure to
Take Corrective Action, and (5) Failure to Investigate.
 
From September 13, 2024 through September 25, 2024, the
Court held a jury trial on two causes of action within the 3AC - Retaliation under Labor Code section
1102.5 and Retaliation under FEHA.  On October 23, 2024, the Court entered
judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against County for damages of $567,756.50,
based on the cause of action for Retaliation
under Labor Code section 1102.5.
 
Plaintiff now moves for attorney fees. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling
 
Plaintiff’s motion for attorney fees is GRANTED in the
amount of $1,289,659.75.

 
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
The
attorney bears the burden of proof as to “reasonableness” of any fee claim.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(c)(5).) This burden requires competent evidence as
to the nature and value of the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi
(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are
prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were
necessarily incurred. (See Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677,
682.) “Testimony of an attorney as to the number of hours worked on a
particular case is sufficient evidence to support an award of attorney fees,
even in the absence of detailed time records.” (Martino v. Denevi
(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) 
 
“In
challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of work are
claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific
items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.
General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do
not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459,
488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee
Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)¿¿ 
 
In
determining whether the requested attorney’s fees are “reasonable,” the Court’s
“first step involves the lodestar figure—a calculation based on the number of
hours reasonably expended multiplied by the lawyer’s hourly rate. The lodestar
figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of facts specific to the
case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided.” (Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th
770, 774 [internal citations omitted].) In determining whether to adjust the
lodestar figure, the Court may consider the nature and difficulty of the
litigation, the amount of money involved, the skill required and employed to
handle the case, the attention given, the success or failure, and other
circumstances in the case. (EnPalm LLC v. Teitler (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th
770, 774; PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084,
1095.) “‘The reasonable market value of the attorney's services is the
measure of a reasonable hourly rate. [Citations.] This standard applies
regardless of whether the attorneys claiming fees charge nothing for their
services, charge at below-market or discounted rates, represent the client on a
straight contingent fee basis, or are in-house counsel. [Citations.]’” (Center
For Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th
603, 619.)

The Court grants County’s request in its entirety. 
 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTION
 
Plaintiff objects to the Declaration of Grant Stiefel in support of Defendant’s Opposition
to Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees on the basis that it violates a prior
court order precluding Defendant from introducing any expert testimony
whatsoever. Plaintiff contends that this Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion in
Limine Number 1 and expressly precluded Defendant from introducing any expert
testimony. 
 
However, the
Court’s order in granting the motion in limine did not specify whether the
motion only applied to expert testimony produced at trial. The Court finds that
the Court’s order granting the motion in limine to preclude County from
introducing expert testimony did not extend to post-trial motions. 

Thus, Plaintiff’s objection is overruled.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff is
seeking attorney fees in the amount of $2,636,878.50 as the prevailing party
against County. Plaintiff is seeking attorney fees pursuant to California Labor
Code Section 1102.5 subdivision (j).
 
1.     
Entitlement to Fees 
 
Labor
Code section 1102.5 subdivision (j) authorizes the Court to award reasonable
attorney's fees to a plaintiff who brings a successful action for a violation
of 1102.5. While this subsection was added to the Code on January 1, 2021, the
latest version of the subsection became effective on January 1, 2024.   The Courts of Appeal have held “that in the
absence of express legislative intent to the contrary, ‘a new statute
authorizing an award of attorney fees’ or a statute ‘increasing or decreasing
litigation costs, including attorneys' fees’ applies to actions pending at the
time of enactment.” (USS-Posco Indus. v. Case (2016) 197
Cal.Rptr.3d 791, 810.) 
 
Because
the subsection(j), which authorizes an award of attorney fees for violation of
provisions within Labor Code section 1102.5, was added to the Code while the
instant action “was not yet final at the time [the subsection became]
effective,” Plaintiff is entitled to an award of attorney fees. (California Hous. Fin. Agency v. E.R. Fairway Assocs. I
(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1508, 1513; see also Hogan
v. Ingold (1952) 38 Cal.2d 802, 814 (“[S]tatutes either
increasing or decreasing the allowable costs, including attorney fees, are
consistently applied to litigation pending when such statutes became effective,
unless a contrary intent clearly appears from the statute.”)].)
 
2.     
Reasonableness
of Fees 
 
“If a plaintiff has
prevailed on some claims but not others, fees are not awarded for time spent
litigating claims unrelated to the successful claims, and the trial court
should award only that amount of fees that is reasonable in relation to the
results obtained. (Citation).” (Chavez v. City of Los Angeles (2010) 47 Cal.4th 970,
989.) Although fees are not reduced when a plaintiff prevails on only one of
several factually related and closely intertwined claims (citation), under
state law as well as federal law, a reduced fee award is appropriate when a
claimant achieves only limited success. (Citation).” (Ibid.) Where a
plaintiff has obtained excellent results, his attorney should recover a
fully compensatory fee. Normally this will encompass all hours reasonably
expended on the litigation.... In these circumstances the fee award should not
be reduced simply because the plaintiff failed to prevail on every contention
raised in the lawsuit. [Citation.]” (Hensley
v. Eckerhart (1983) 461 U.S. 424, 440.)
 
In Wysinger,
the prevailing party alleged eight causes of action, but prevailed on two
causes of action, including a retaliation-based cause of action. (Wysinger v. Auto. Club of S. California (2007) 157
Cal.App.4th 413, 430.) The Wysinger Court affirmed the trial court’s
award to the prevailing party, even though the losing party contended that
award should have been reduced because the prevailing party succeeded on some
but not all causes of action. (Ibid.) 
 
The
Court finds that like in Wysinger, the cause of action on which
Plaintiff did not prevail is “common to another and intertwined” with the cause
of action on which Plaintiff did prevail. Both causes of action were pled in
the 3AC based on the same facts, and involved the same allegations premised upon
the retaliation plaintiff experienced for being a whistleblower and opposing
unlawful employment practices, including disparate treatment due to his race.
“[E]mployment discrimination cases, by their very nature, involve several
causes of action arising from the same set of facts.” (Brown v. Superior Court
(1984) 37 Cal.3d 477, 486.) Thus, Plaintiff’s fee award should not be reduced
on the basis that Plaintiff’s FEHA claim is completely
distinguishable from the section 1102.5 claim on which he prevailed. 
 
Plaintiff
is requesting attorney fees in the amount of $2,636,878.50. 
 
Plaintiff
argues that over the last six-and-a-half years of litigation, since Counsel for
Plaintiff was retained, the instant case has been heavily and judiciously
litigated by Plaintiff. Plaintiff’s counsel states that the following
litigation events have transpired: Plaintiff propounded nine (9) sets of
written discovery on Defendant, totaling 110 written requests; Defendant
propounded eleven (11) sets of written discovery on Plaintiff, totaling 180
written requests; thousands of pages of documents were exchanged, reviewed, and
analyzed; between the parties, sixty-one (61) motions/ex parte applications,
oppositions/objections, and/or replies were drafted and filed, and the parties
attended the associated hearings; between the parties, numerous pretrial documents
(witness lists, jury instructions, exhibit lists, trial briefs, etc.) were
drafted and filed with the court (the number of such documents approximates
(71) seventy-one); the parties drafted motions in limine and in connection with
said motions, sixty-nine (69) motions, oppositions, and/or replies were drafted
and filed by the parties; and the parties attended a mediation and an MSC.
Then, after all of the foregoing, Plaintiff and his counsel were engaged in
five weeks of jury trial, where testimony/evidence was submitted, a motion for
nonsuit was opposed; and after careful deliberation, the jury ultimately
rendered a verdict in favor of Plaintiff on his Labor Code section 1102.5
retaliation claim. (Felahy Decl., ¶ 12.)

As stated similarly above, the party seeking
attorney fees and costs “bear[s] the burden of establishing entitlement to an award
and documenting the appropriate hours expended and hourly rates” to show that
the fees incurred were allowable and reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation. (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165
Cal.App.4th 1315, 1320-22.) To satisfy this burden, evidence and
descriptions of billable tasks must be presented in sufficient detail, enabling
the court to evaluate whether the case was overstaffed, the time attorneys
spent on specific claims, and the reasonableness of the hours expended.  (Lunada
Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 486-487.)
 
A party seeking attorney fees is “not automatically
entitled to all hours they claim in their request for fees. They must prove the
hours they sought were reasonable and necessary.” (El Escorial Owners' Assn.
v. DLC Plastering, Inc. (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 1337, 1366.) “A fee request
that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting the
trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether. (Citation)." (Christian
Research Institute, supra, 165 Cal.App.4th at p. 1321-22.)
 
The Court is
cognizant of the amount of time Plaintiff’s counsel expended on litigating the
instant action, which spanned multiple years, that came to a fortunate
conclusion for Plaintiff in the form of a judgment for $567,756.50. However,
the Court finds that the amount of attorney fees requested by Plaintiff’s
counsel to still be excessive. 
 
Firstly,
Plaintiff’s counsel has only provided the Court with a summary sheet of work
that each employee completed during the course of litigation. (Felahy Decl.,
Exhibit 4.) The work performed is separated into distinct categories
“A” through “I,” with descriptors attached to each category (ie, “Amendments to
Pleadings; Motions to Amend; Admin. Filings/Gov't Claim(s);
Oppositions/Briefing, Research & Hearings Related to Challenges to
Pleadings,” “Depositions and Related Deposition Prep,” or “Jury Selection.” (Ibid.)
While an award of attorney fees may be based on counsel’s declarations, without
production of detailed time records, Plaintiff still has the burden of
providing the Court with an explanation as why the hours sought are reasonable
and necessary. (Raining Data Corp. v. Barrenechea
(2009) 175 Cal App.4th 1363, 1375.)
 
For Category
D, which reflects “Pre-Trial Work including Preparation of Pre-Trial Documents,
Trial Exhibits, Meetings with Clients and Witnesses, preparation of deposition
summaries and testimony outlines, work on pre-trial motions/ex partes,”
Plaintiff’s counsel seeks 1766.6 hours. County has provided the declaration of
Attorney Fees Expert Grant Stiefel. Stiefel opines that ““most of the
depositions in this case were very short” with “the average deposition time [being]
less than two hours,” which should not have taken more than “2-3 hours to
summarize.” (Stiefel Decl., ¶¶ 72-76.) Additionally, because most depositions
were attended by two of Plaintiff’s lawyers, “the time taken to summarize
[transcripts of those depositions] is duplicative and not reasonable.” (Superior
Form Builders v. Dan Chase Taxidermy Supply, 881 F.Supp. 1021, 1026 (E.D.
Va. 1994). Expert Steifel states he “cannot conceive how Plaintiff’s counsel
could have reasonably spent nearly a year of full-time billable work on the
limited tasks enumerated in Category D, which should have taken a few hundred
hours at most.” (Stiefel Decl., ¿
77.) For these reasons, the Court will reduce the request reflected in Category
D by 75%. (Stiefel Decl., Exhibit G.)
 
For Category
A(2), which reflects “Depositions and Related Depo Prep,” Plaintiff’s counsel
seeks 547 hours. However, most of the depositions in this case were very brief:
aside from Plaintiff Raju’s deposition, which spanned five sessions. The
average time of each deposition appearance was just one hour and fifty-two
minutes (1:52). (Stiefel Decl., ¿
80 [Exhibit E (Summary of Deposition Length).) The total time Counsel spent in
actual deposition was just under 40 hours, meaning that 507 hours were
purportedly billed for deposition preparation. This means that for every hour
on the record, the Felahy firm billed for twelve hours of prep time. This is
unreasonable. (Stiefel Decl., ¿¿
80-82.) The Court finds that the ratio of 12:1 for preparation for deposition
to be excessive. For these reasons, the Court will reduce the request reflected
in Category A(2) by 75%. (Stiefel Decl., Exhibit G.)
 
For Category
A(3), which reflects “Review of documents & evidence produced by
Defendant(s) and analysis & investigation,” Plaintiff’s counsel seeks 702.6
hours. However, Plaintiff produced around 855 pages of documents, while County
produced 2,536 pages. For the number of hours Plaintiff has requested, this
equates to about thirteen (13) minutes of review time for each page produced. Courts
have held that six minutes to review a single document is unreasonable and that
“approximately two and a half minutes… is a more reasonable estimation of the
time it would take an attorney to review a one-page, routine document.” (Fryar
v. Saul, No. 7:19-CV-198-RJ, at *8 (E.D.N.C. Feb. 26, 2021).) For these
reasons, the Court will reduce the request reflected in Category A(3) by 75%.
(Stiefel Decl., Exhibit G.)
 
For
Categories E and F, County contends that Attorney Farbod Nourian’s hourly rate
should be reduced to $225.00 an hour because Mr. Nourian’s role at trial was
more akin to paralegal work, as he purportedly “did not participate in voir
dire, did not address the jury, and did not question any witnesses.” The Court
does not agree with this reduction. 
 
For
Categories A(1), A(3), A(4), B(2), C, F and I, County contends, based on Expert
Stiefel’s recommendation, that a 40% discount is warranted for “vagueness and
block billing,” as to internal conferencing and communications among counsel.
Expert Stiefel states that “it not possible to determine how much time was
attributed to internal attorney conferencing, because any billing entries that
might reflect such intra-office communications has been subsumed within
Plaintiff’s vague, block-billed summary of work.” (Stiefel Decl., ¶ 91.)
Because Plaintiff has not provided the court with billing records, the Court
cannot discern how much of the time billed was duplicative or unnecessary.
Additionally, Expert Stiefel states that in his experience, ten people billing
time to this matter is excessive. (Id. ¶ 93.) For these reasons, the
Court will reduce these entries by 40%. (Stiefel Decl., Exhibit G.)
 
Plaintiff
also seeks 120.2 hours of work for three legal secretaries. County also
contends that all work done by legal secretaries in this matter to be
eliminated as Plaintiff “is not entitled to be compensated for administrative
work.” (See Davis v. City and County of San Francisco (9th Cir. 1992)
976 F.2d 1536, 1543 “[“time spent on clerical matters should not have been
included in the attorneys’ fee award”]; Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U.S.
274, 288 n.10 (1989) [“purely clerical or secretarial tasks should not be
billed at a paralegal rate, regardless of who performs them”].) Because of the
lack of information provided by Plaintiff, the Court cannot distinguish what
work done by the legal secretaries was purely for clerical purposes. The Court denies
compensation for unspecified work done  by the legal secretaries. 
 
Therefore,
the Court will award as follows:
