TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s motion to seal the settlement agreement is granted in part as
to: 
 
* the settlement amount; and 
 
*
private contact and/or identification information, if any.
 
The motion is denied as to all
information except the settlement amount and private contact and/or
identification information.
 
Plaintiff
must submit a redacted version for the public file.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a putative class action
concerning a cyberattack that purportedly resulted in unauthorized disclosures
of personal information, including private health information.
 
Recently, the parties reached a
settlement.  In part, the settlement
requires Plaintiff’s individual claims to be dismissed with prejudice and the
class and representative claims to be dismissed without prejudice.
 
Here, Defendant moves to seal the
settlement agreement.
 
LAW
 
The court may order that a record be filed under seal only if
it expressly finds facts that establish: 
 
(1)  
There exists an
overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record;
 
(2)  
The overriding
interest supports sealing the record; 
 
(3)  
A substantial
probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the
record is not sealed; 
 
(4)  
The proposed sealing
is narrowly tailored; and 
 
(5)  
No less restrictive
means exist to achieve the overriding interest.
 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.550(d).) “These findings embody constitutional requirements for a request to seal
court records, protecting the First Amendment right of public access to civil
trials.  (Edmon
& Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civ. Proc. Before Trial (The Rutter Group
June 2023 Update) ¶ 9:418, emphasis in original.) 
 
The
parties’ agreement to seal documents is not enough to support a motion to
seal.  (Id. at ¶ 9:417.1 [“Parties
sometimes operate under an informal arrangement pursuant to which documents are
‘deemed filed under seal’ unless an objection is made.  Such an arrangement ‘is entirely inconsistent
with the mandatory requirements of rules 2.550 and 2.551 and the constitutional
values informing those requirements.’”].)
 
“Only
the specific words of documents that constitute the sensitive material should
be sealed; generally, it is not permissible to seal the entire document.”  (Id. at ¶ 9:418.5.)
 
Case
law recognizes that confidential settlement agreements “may include information
that may warrant sealing[.]”  (Id. at ¶¶
9:418.5, 9:418.8; see also, e.g., Universal City Studio, Inc. v. Superior
Court (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1273.)  
 
But
“[a] settlement agreement . . . does not qualify for sealing after all
references to financial and other confidential data have been redacted.”  (Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 9:418.20.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Given these rules, the Court
grants the motion to seal in part because:
 
* the
motion is unopposed;
 
* an
overriding interest exists in keeping the settlement amount and private contact
and/or identification information, if any, confidential;
 
* the
overriding interest supports sealing the settlement amount and private contact
and/or identification information;
 
*
there is a substantial probability that the overriding interest will be
prejudiced if the motion is denied; and
 
* the
sealing is narrowly tailored and the least restrictive means to protect the
overriding interest.
 
The
remaining information in the settlement agreement – i.e., all information
except the settlement amount and private contact and/or identification
information – is nonconfidential and should not be sealed.  This portion of the motion to seal is denied.
 
Plaintiff
needs to submit a redacted version for the public file that complies with these
findings.
