And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to seal the settlement agreement in part, allowing the settlement amount and private contact/identification information to be kept confidential. However, the judge has denied the motion to seal all other information in the settlement agreement, finding that this information is non-confidential and does not warrant sealing. The judge has instructed the plaintiff to submit a redacted version of the settlement agreement for the public file that complies with the court's findings. The decision is based on California Rules of Court, rule 2.550(d), which requires the court to find specific facts that establish an overriding interest in sealing the record, and case law which recognizes that confidential settlement agreements may include information that warrants sealing.
