And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a response to the demurrer filed by the defendants, Miguel Victoria and Alexandria Mujica, to the first amended complaint filed by the plaintiff, Omar Penagos Lozada. The plaintiff seeks to set aside the trustee sale of his property, which was allegedly improperly executed.

The defendants demur to the complaint on several grounds, including misjoinder of parties, failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and failure to name indispensable parties. The court finds that the defendants' demurrer to the first cause of action is sustained, but grants leave to amend the complaint.

The court also sustains the demurrer to the second, third, and fourth causes of action, finding that they do not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The plaintiff is given 30 days to amend the complaint.

The court notes that the plaintiff has not responded to the demurrer and has not shown how the complaint might be amended. However, the court finds good cause to permit leave to amend in this instance.
