STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a breach of contract action for a construction contract.
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants overcharged Plaintiffs relative to the
portion of the work completed, and that the work was extremely late,
incomplete, and substandard, 
 
Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants Daniel
Wang and Grace Lee move for evidentiary and issue sanctions against Defendants
and Cross-Complainant 360 Capital Ventures for failure to comply with the
Court’s July 24, 2023 Order requiring further production of documents in
response to certain requests for production. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants Daniel
Wang and Grace Lee move evidentiary and issue sanctions against Defendants and
Cross-Complainant 360 Capital Ventures for failure to comply with the Court’s
July 24, 2023 Order requiring further production of documents in response to
certain requests for production. 
 
Plaintiffs’ motion is not
accompanied by a separate statement setting forth the discovery requests and
responses at issue. A separate statement is required for any motion to compel
further responses, to compel a deposition, or a motion for issue or evidentiary
sanctions where responses have been provided. (Cal. Rule of Court 3.1345(a).) The
purpose of a separate statement in the context of a discovery motion is to
“provide[ ] all the information necessary to understand each discovery request
and all the responses to it that are at issue,” and why the relief sought is
appropriate. (Rule 3.1345(c); see also subd. (c)(3).) The Court is not inclined
to impose the substantial remedy of issue or evidentiary sanctions based on a
procedurally deficient motion that does not clearly set forth the requests at
issue, the responses provided, and why the sanctions sought are necessary to
remediate the injury caused by the failure to provide adequate responses. “[T]rial courts should select sanctions tailored to
the harm caused by the misuse of the discovery process and should not exceed
what is required to protect the party harmed by the misuse of the discovery
process.” (Dept. of Forestry & Fire Protection v. Howell (2017) 18
Cal.App.5th 154, 191, disapproved of on other grounds in Presbyterian Camp
& Conference Centers, Inc. v. Superior Court (2021) 12 Cal.5th 493.) The
absence of a separate statement hinders the Court’s ability to match the remedy
to the harm caused by the misuse of the discovery process. For this reason,
Plaintiffs’ request for nonmonetary sanctions cannot be granted. 
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ Motion for Issue and Evidentiary Sanctions is DENIED.
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
