And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for issue and evidentiary sanctions filed by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants failed to comply with a court order requiring further production of documents. The judge denied the motion because it was not accompanied by a separate statement setting forth the discovery requests and responses at issue. The judge also noted that the absence of a separate statement hinders the court's ability to match the remedy to the harm caused by the misuse of the discovery process.
