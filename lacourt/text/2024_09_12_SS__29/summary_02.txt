And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for a protective order as moot. The motion was filed by Tricia Pride, who alleges that she was injured at a Whole Foods Market on Ventura Boulevard in Woodland Hills on August 11, 2019. The plaintiff had previously filed a complaint and amended it to name Mrs. Gooch's Natural Food Markets, Inc. as a defendant. The defendant filed an answer and issued subpoenas to the plaintiff's current and former employers, seeking discovery. The plaintiff did not file a motion to quash the subpoenas and the employers eventually produced some of the subpoenaed documents. The defendant is satisfied with the responses and the judge has denied the motion for a protective order as moot. If the defendant seeks further discovery in the future, either party may file an appropriate motion.
