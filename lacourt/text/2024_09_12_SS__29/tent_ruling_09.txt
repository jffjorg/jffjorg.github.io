City of Los Angeles
23STCV31457
Demurrer filed by Defendant Mariposa Landscapes, Inc.
Tentative
The demurrer
is sustained in part and overruled in part.
Background
On December
26, 2023, Brian Grant Wood (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against City of Los
Angeles (“City”), County of Los Angeles (“County”), the State of California (“State”),
the State of California Department of Transportation (“DOT”), Caltrans, and
Does 1 to 100, arising out of an incident on August 6, 2023, in which Plaintiff
alleges that he was severely injured by a fixture in the street median located
near 3960 S. Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles. 
Plaintiff asserts causes of action for: (1) dangerous condition of public
property; and (2) general negligence.
On March
6, 2024, County filed an answer. 
On April
10, 2024, City filed an answer and a cross-complaint against State, DOT, County,
Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission, and Roes 1 through 10.
On April
23, 2024, the Court, at the request of City, dismissed the causes of action
against County in the cross-complaint.
On May
16, 2024, Plaintiff amended the complaint to name Community Resource and Talent
Development (“CRTD”) as Doe 1, University of Southern California (“USC”) as Doe
2, and Mariposa Landscapes, Inc. (“Mariposa”) as Doe 3. University of Southern
California filed an answer on August 23.
On June
20, City amended its cross-complaint to name CRTD as Roe 1. 
On July
25, 2024, the Court, at the request of City, dismissed the causes of action
against State in the cross-complaint.
On
August 23, 2024, USC filed an answer to the complaint.
Currently
before the Court, and set for hearing on September 12, is a demurrer to the complaint
filed by Mariposa on August 13, 2024. 
Plaintiff filed an opposition on August 28, and Mariposa filed a reply
on September 5. 
Legal
Standard
Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.10 provides:
“The party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed
may object, by demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to the
pleading on any one or more of the following grounds:
(a) The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the
cause of action alleged in the pleading.
(b) The person who filed the pleading does not have the
legal capacity to sue.
(c) There is another action pending between the same
parties on the same cause of action.
(d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties.
(e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.
(f) The pleading is uncertain. As used in this subdivision,
“uncertain” includes ambiguous and unintelligible.
(g) In an action founded upon a contract, it cannot be
ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is
implied by conduct.
(h) No certificate was filed as required by Section
411.35.”
A
demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint or other pleading.  In ruling on a demurrer, the Court accepts as
true “all material facts properly pleaded,” along with “matters that may be
judicially noticed.”  (Centinela Freeman
Emergency Medical Associates v. Health Net of California (2016) 1 Cal.5th
994, 1010; Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)  The Court need not, however, accept the truth
of contentions or conclusions of law contained in the pleading.  (Centinela, supra, 1 Cal.5th at p.
1010; Blank, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318.)  
A demurrer may address
only defects that appear on the face of the pleading; other than judicially
noticeable facts, no other extrinsic evidence may be considered.  (Blank, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318; Guardian
North Bay, Inc. v. Super. Ct. (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.)
It is not the function of
the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the properly pleaded allegations
of the complaint.  The Court accepts as
true “even improbable alleged facts” as a demurrer is not the correct
procedural posture to address “plaintiff’s ability to prove the factual
allegations.”  (Marina Pacific Hotel
and Suites v. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 96,
104-105; accord Hacker v. Homeward Residential (2018) 26 Cal.App.5th
270, 280.)  
Courts must “liberally
construe the pleading with a view to substantial justice between the parties”
and must “give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole
and its parts in context.”  (Marina
Pacific, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at p. 105.)
A
demurrer may be sustained only if it disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner
v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of
Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)
“When
the ground of demurrer is based on a matter of which the court may take
judicial notice …, such matter shall be specified in the demurrer, or in the
supporting points and authorities for the purpose of invoking such notice
….”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.70.)
Before
filing a demurrer, the demurring party must meet and confer with the opposing
party to determine “whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)
Leave to amend should be
granted when “there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.”  (Centinela, supra, 1
Cal.5th at p. 1010; Blank, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318; Shaeffer v.
Califia Farms (2020) 44 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1145.)
Discussion
The meet
and confer requirement of Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 has been
satisfied. (Shonack Decl., ¶¶ 3 & 4.) 
Mariposa
contends each of the two causes of action in Plaintiff’s complaint fails to
allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action against it and demurs under
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10(e). 
Mariposa also contends that any cause of action against it is barred as
a matter of law by the “Completed and Accepted” Doctrine. 
First
Cause of Action: Dangerous Condition of Public Property 
Under
Government Code section 835:
“[A] public
entity is liable for injury caused by a dangerous condition of its property if
the plaintiff establishes that the property was in a dangerous condition at the
time of the injury, that the injury was proximately caused by the dangerous
condition, that the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable risk
of the kind of injury which was incurred, and that either:
(a) A
negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee of the public entity
within the scope of his employment created the dangerous condition; or
(b) The
public entity had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition
under Section 835.2 a sufficient time prior to the injury to have taken
measures to protect against the dangerous condition.”
(Government
Code § 835.)
Mariposa
demurs to the First Cause of Action on a number of grounds, including that it
is not a public entity and therefore not subject to liability under Government
Code section 835 or any of the other Government Code provisions mentioned in
the complaint.  Plaintiff concedes the
point and does not (and likely could not reasonably) seek leave to amend.
Accordingly,
Mariposa’s demurrer to the First Cause of Action in the complaint is sustained without
leave to amend.
Second Cause
of Action: General Negligence
Mariposa
also demurs to the negligence cause of action in the complaint.  Mariposa argues that the complaint does not adequately
allege the elements of a negligence claim against it.
The
basic elements of a cause of action for negligence are: (1) the existence of a
legal duty; (2)
breach of that duty; (3) causation; and (4) resulting damages. (Brown
v. USA Taekwondo (2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 213; Kesner v. Superior Court (2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1158; Castellon v. U.S. Bancorp
(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.) The existence and scope of duty are legal questions
for the court.¿¿(Brown, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 213; Annocki¿v.
Peterson Enterprises, LLC¿(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 32, 36.)
Civil Code
section 1714 provides: “Everyone is responsible, not
only for the result of his or her willful acts, but also for an injury
occasioned to another by his or her want of ordinary care or skill in the
management of his or her property or person, except so far as the latter has,
willfully or by want of ordinary care, brought the injury upon himself or
herself.” (Civ. Code, § 1714, subd. (a).) This establishes what the California
Supreme Court has described as the “default rule” that every person has a legal
duty “to exercise, in his or her activities, reasonable care for the safety of
others.” (Brown, supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 214.)  “In a contract for services, a
contracting party may be liable for negligence in the performance of those
services or failure to perform.” (Bevis v. Terrace View Partners, LP
(2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 230, 258.)
The
Court has carefully reviewed the allegations of the complaint.  Liberally construing those allegations,
Plaintiff alleges that Mariposa (along with the other defendants) designed,
constructed, installed and/or maintained a dangerous and hazardous condition.  (Complaint, ¶ 31; see also id., ¶ 14 [incorporated
by reference into the Second Cause of Action].) 
Further, Plaintiff alleges that Mariposa failed to provide proper
barriers, protection, signs, or warnings to protect Plaintiff and other members
of the public from this danger.  (Id.,
¶ 30.)  This was, according to Plaintiff,
a breach of Mariposa’s duty to use reasonable care.  (Id., ¶ 31.)  And this breach, it is alleged, was the
proximate and legal cause of Plaintiff’s injuries.  (Id., ¶ 33-34; see also id., ¶
12 [incorporated by reference into the Second Cause of Action].)
Given California’s
liberal notice pleading standards, this is a sufficient pleading of a
negligence cause of action against Mariposa. 
In the
alternative, and independently, Mariposa argues that the negligence cause of
action alleged against it is barred, as a matter of law, by the “Completed and Accepted”
Doctrine.  As the Court of Appeal has
explained:
“[W]hen a contractor completes work that is
accepted by the owner, the contractor is not liable to third parties injured as
a result of the condition of the work, even if the contractor was negligent in
performing the contract, unless the defect in the work was latent or
concealed.  [Citation.]  The rationale for this doctrine is that an
owner has a duty to inspect the work and ascertain its safety, and thus the
owner’s acceptance of the work shifts liability for its safety to the owner,
provided that a reasonable inspection would disclose the defect.”  
(Jones v. P.S. Development
Co., Inc. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 707, 712, disapproved on other grounds in Reid v. Google, Inc. (2010) 50 Cal.4th 512.) 
“If an owner, fulfilling the duty of
inspection, cannot discover the defect, then the owner cannot effectively
represent to the world that the construction is sufficient; he lacks adequate
information to do so.” (Sanchez v. Swinerton & Walberg Co. (1996) 47
Cal.App.4th 1461, 1467.) “A “latent” defect is one that is “not apparent by
reasonable inspection.” (Creekridge Townhome Owners Assn., Inc. v. C. Scott Whitten,
Inc. (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 251, 257.)
It may be that, on the
facts, Mariposa has a defense under the Completed and Accepted Doctrine.  Or perhaps not.  But the Court cannot adjudicate this defense,
as a matter of law and in Mariposa’s favor, based on the allegations in the complaint.  Nothing in the complaint addresses whether
the work was complete prior to Plaintiff’s accident, whether the owner accepted
it, and whether the allegedly dangerous condition was patent or latent.  The applicability of this defense must be
determined at a later stage of these proceedings.  On the pleadings, the Court cannot conclude
that Plaintiff’s negligence cause of action against Mariposa is barred as a
matter of law.
Accordingly, the demurrer
to the Second Cause of Action in the complaint is overruled.
Conclusion
The
Court SUSTAINS Mariposa’s demurrer to the First Cause of Action in the complaint,
without leave to amend.
The
Court OVERRULES Mariposa’s demurrer to the Second Cause of Action in the
Complaint.
Moving
Party is to give notice.
