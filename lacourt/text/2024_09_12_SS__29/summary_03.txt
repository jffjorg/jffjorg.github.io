Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the settlement between the plaintiff, Katheryn Heukrodt, and Dustin Harris dba Harris Concrete Pumping for $2 million is in good faith under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6. The settlement was reached after arms-length negotiations and is supported by the factors set forth in Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, including a rough approximation of the plaintiff's total recovery, the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, and the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs. The judge also considered the settling party's financial conditions and insurance policy limits, as well as any evidence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of non-settling defendants. The judge found that the settlement is reasonable and does not unfairly prejudice the interests of non-settling defendants. The motion for determination of good faith settlement is granted.
