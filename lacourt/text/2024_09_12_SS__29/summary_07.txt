And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff to appear for deposition and produce documents as moot in part and without prejudice in part. The motion was filed before the scheduled deposition date, and the parties met and conferred to postpone the deposition. The plaintiff appeared for the deposition but failed to produce some requested documents. The judge expressed concern that the motion did not clearly state what relief the defendants were seeking and that the defendants did not give adequate notice to the plaintiff regarding the document requests. The judge also noted that the defendants did not provide sufficient information regarding what specific documents they were seeking to enforce. As a result, the judge denied the motion to compel the plaintiff to appear for deposition as moot and denied the motion to compel the plaintiff to produce documents without prejudice.
