And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Avis Budget Group, Inc.'s (ABGI) motion to quash service of summons. ABGI argued that it was not properly named as a Doe defendant under Code of Civil Procedure section 474, as Plaintiffs knew of its identity at the time of the accident in October 2019. However, the judge found that the record did not support ABGI's assertions, and that there was no evidence to show that Plaintiffs actually knew the facts giving rise to a cause of action against ABGI at the time the complaint was filed. The judge concluded that the motion to quash should be denied, but noted that ABGI may raise its statute of limitations defense at a later stage of the proceeding if appropriate.
