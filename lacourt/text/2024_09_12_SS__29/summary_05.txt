And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions without prejudice. The motion was denied because the plaintiff's memorandum of points and authorities exceeded the maximum length of 15 pages, and the plaintiff did not file an ex parte application for permission to file a longer memorandum. The judge based its decision on California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(d) and (e), which state that memoranda of points and authorities should not exceed 15 pages, unless an exception applies. The judge exercised its discretion to decline to consider the overlong memorandum and denied the motion as a result. The judge orders the moving party to give notice.
