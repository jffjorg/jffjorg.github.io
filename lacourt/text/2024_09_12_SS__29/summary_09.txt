Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Mariposa Landscapes, Inc. against the complaint filed by Brian Grant Wood. The demurrer was argued on the grounds that the complaint does not adequately allege a cause of action against Mariposa. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action, which is based on a dangerous condition of public property, but has overruled the demurrer to the second cause of action, which is based on general negligence. The judge has concluded that the pleading of the second cause of action is sufficient to state a claim against Mariposa, although the applicability of the "Completed and Accepted" Doctrine may be a defense that must be determined at a later stage of the proceedings.
