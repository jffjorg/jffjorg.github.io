 Case Number:  20STCV43674    Hearing Date:   September 12, 2024    Dept:  29 Pride v. Whole Foods Market California, Inc.
20STCV43674
Plaintiff’s Motion for Protective Order
Tentative
The motion is denied as moot.
Background
Plaintiff Tricia Pride (“Plaintiff”) alleges that she was
injured on August 11, 2019, when she slipped and fell at a Whole Foods Market
on Ventura Boulevard in Woodland Hills.  
On November 13, 2020, Plaintiff filed the Complaint in this
action, asserting causes of action for negligence and premises liability
against Whole Foods Market California, Inc., and Does 1 through 50.  On December 16, 2020, Plaintiff amended the Complaint
to name Mrs. Gooch’s Natural Food Markets, Inc. (“Defendant”) as Doe 1; on the
same day, Plaintiff filed a request to dismiss, without prejudice, Whole Foods
Market California, Inc.
On March 30, 2023, Defendant filed its Answer to the
Complaint. 
On August 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion
for a protective order. Defendants filed an opposition on August 29. No reply
has been filed.
Discussion
Plaintiff moves for a protective order
under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.090, 2031.060, and 2033.080.  Each of these provisions relates to discovery
between parties (interrogatories, requests for protection, and requests for
admission).
The disputed discovery, however, does not
relate to discovery between the parties. 
Rather, it relates to subpoenas issued to Plaintiff’s current and former
employers.  (See Bennett Decl., ¶¶ 3, 13
& Exh. A.)  Plaintiff could have
filed, but did not file, a motion to quash these subpoenas.  (Id., ¶ 18.)  Ultimately, Defendant and the nonparty employers
reached an agreement, and the employers produced at least some of the
subpoenaed documents.  (Id., ¶
23.)  Defendant is satisfied with the
responses to the subpoenas.  (Id.,
¶ 24.)
Under these circumstances, the motion for
a protective order is denied as moot.  It
is also denied without prejudice.  If
Defendant seeks further discovery (whether from nonparties or from Plaintiff) in
this subject area, either party may file any appropriate motion.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion for a
protective order as moot.Moving party to give notice.
