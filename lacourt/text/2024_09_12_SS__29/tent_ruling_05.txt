v. Clubbizz, LLC
21STCV46993
Plaintiff’s Motion for Terminating Sanctions
Tentative
The
motion is denied without prejudice.
The
maximum length of a memorandum of points and authorities (subject to certain
exceptions that do not apply here) is 15 pages. 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(d).) 
Plaintiff exceeded that by 10 pages. 
Plaintiff could have filed an ex parte application for permission to
file a longer memorandum, stating the reasons why the argument cannot be made
within the standard page limit.  (Id.,
rule 3.1113(e).)  He did not do so.
After
considering the nature of the relief sought, as well as all other relevant
facts and circumstances, the Court exercises its discretion to decline to
consider the overlong memorandum. 
Accordingly, the motion is denied without prejudice.
Moving
party to give notice.
