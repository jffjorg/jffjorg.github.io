Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendant's motion to disqualify the plaintiff's counsel, Hovanes Margarian, from representing the plaintiff in the action. The defendant argues that Margarian has a conflict of interest because his law firm's inadequate IT security and failure to detect the breach of their email system resulted in the hacking of the plaintiff's email and the payment of funds to hackers. The defendant also argues that Margarian's inquiry into potentially representing other parties in the future raises questions about his ability to represent the plaintiff. However, the court finds that the defendant lacks standing to bring the motion because they are not and have not been Margarian's clients, and they have not alleged any confidential or fiduciary relationship with him.

The defendant also argues that Margarian should be disqualified because he is likely to testify as a fact witness at trial. However, the court finds that the defendant has not made a convincing demonstration of detriment to justify disqualification. The court notes that Margarian's testimony may actually disadvantage the plaintiff, and that the defendant's argument that Margarian's dual role as advocate and witness will likely prejudice the defendant and cause juror confusion is unavailing. Ultimately, the court concludes that the defendant's motion to disqualify counsel is denied.
