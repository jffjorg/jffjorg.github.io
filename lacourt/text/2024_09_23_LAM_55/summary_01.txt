Significant Statements:
  - "The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer." (Code Civ. Proc. ยง 473(a)(1))
  - "This discretion should be exercised liberally in favor of amendments, for judicial policy favors resolution of all disputed matters in the same lawsuit." (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045)
  - "If the motion to amend is timely made and the granting of the motion will not prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to amend and where the refusal also results in a party being deprived of the right to assert a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious defense, it is not only error but an abuse of discretion." (Morgan v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527)
  - "Where the trial date is set, the jury is about to be impaneled, counsel, the parties, the trial court, and the witnesses have blocked the time, and the only way to avoid prejudice to the opposing party is to continue the trial date to allow further discovery, refusal of leave to amend cannot be an abuse of discretion." (Magpali v. Farmers Group (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471)
  - "Plaintiff's motion is not timely based on either of Plaintiff's explanation of changed circumstances. First, Lawndale filed their cross-complaint in September 2023, almost a year before Plaintiff filed this Motion. Plaintiff has offered no justification for this delay."
