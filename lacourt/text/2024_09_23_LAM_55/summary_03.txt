And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant's motion to disqualify counsel is denied. The plaintiff, Armine Avetissian, has brought an action against the defendants, alleging that they failed to pay her the money owed under a settlement agreement. The defendants argue that the plaintiff's counsel, Hovanes Margarian, has a conflict of interest because he faces potential liability due to his law firm's inadequate IT security and failure to detect the breach of their email system, which led to the hacking of the plaintiff's account. They also argue that Margarian's potential testimony at trial would prejudice them and cause juror confusion.

The court has considered the factors relevant to the advocate-witness rule and has found that the defendants have not made a convincing demonstration of detriment. The court concludes that Margarian's testimony as a fact witness at trial would not prejudice the defendants, and that the plaintiff has given informed written consent to his dual role as advocate and witness. Therefore, the court denies the defendant's motion to disqualify counsel.
