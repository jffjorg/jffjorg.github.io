And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Defendant's Person Most Knowledgeable and has denied the request for production of documents. The court finds that the plaintiff has met and conferred with the defendant in an attempt to discuss the deposition and that the notice of deposition is proper. The court will compel the deposition of the Person Most Knowledgeable on August 15, 2024. The court finds that the defendant has already produced some relevant documents and that the additional requests are not necessary. The court denies the motion to compel production of documents without prejudice. The court will not award sanctions to the plaintiff as they did not request them. The court orders that the plaintiff provide notice of this ruling.
