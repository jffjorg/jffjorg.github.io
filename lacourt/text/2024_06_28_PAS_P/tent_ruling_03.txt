 Case Number:  23AHCV02170    Hearing Date:   June 28, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING THE
DEMURRER TO CROSS-COMPLAINANT’S FIRST AMENDED CROSS-COMPLAINT WITH LEAVE TO
AMEND AND SUSTAINING THE DEMURRER TO PENAL
CODE SECTION 496 CAUSE OF ACTION WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMENDI.               
INTRODUCTION
A.    Factual Background
This action relates to the acquisition of an entertainment channel.  
Cross-Defendants Faith Bautista (“Bautista”) and Victor G. Tamashiro
(“Tamashiro”), (jointly “Cross-Defendants”) are the founding shareholders of
Faith7, Inc., a California corporation (“Faith7”). (FAC, ¶ 11.)  On July 21, 2022, Faith7 merged into Faith7
Inc., a Delaware corporation, doing business in California as Chime TV, Inc.,
(“Chime TV”). (FACC, ¶ 5.) Chime TV is an entertainment channel focused
on media programming in Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities. (Id.)
Cross-Complainant Society One, Inc. (“Society One”) is a private members
club founded to advance the interests of the AAPI community by entrepreneur and
film producer, Takashi Cheng (“Cheng”). (FACC, ¶ 13.) Cross-Complainant Golden
TV, Inc., (“GTV”) was developed by Cheng to stream original AAPI programs and content
to its subscribers. (FACC, ¶ 14.) Society One and GTV are jointly
Cross-Complainants. 
In May 2022, Cheng and Tamashiro began negotiations to strategically
align Faith 7’s programs with GTV’s streaming capabilities. (FACC, ¶ 16.) In
June 2022, Bautista allegedly solicited a $2,000,000 investment from Cheng to
reach the $8,500,000 financing goal to launch Chime TV. (FACC, ¶¶18-19.) Bautista
claimed to have secured $6,500,000 from other investors, including the National
Asian American Coalition (“NAAC”), a California-based Housing Counseling Agency
certified non-profit organization founded by Bautista in 2004. (FACC, p. 3.)
Cheng agreed to invest the $2,500,000 upon proof of funding from other
investors. (Id.) The following month, Bautista informed Cheng that she returned
$2,500,000 to NAAC. (Id., ¶ 20.) Because Bautista did not provide proof
of funding, Cheng did not invest the promised $2,500,000 and Chime TV launched
in January 2023. (FACC, ¶ 22.) GTV launched in February 2023. (FACC, ¶¶ 22-23.)

On April 9, 2023, NAAC filed a complaint for breach of fiduciary duty and
six other claims against Bautista and others in Case No. 23STCV10387 (the “NAAC
Lawsuit”). (Cross-Complaint, Exh. A.) This case is pending before the Los
Angeles Superior Court, Stanley Mosk Courthouse, Dept. 51.
Chime TV and Society One/GTV resumed negotiations and in May 2023, the
parties entered into the Stock Transfer Agreement (the “STA”) and Common Stock
Purchase Agreement (“CSPA”) for the purchase of Faith7. (FAC, Exhs., A, B.) Under
the terms of the STA, Bautista and Tamashiro sold 1,754,386 shares in Faith7
common stock to GTV and Society One for an aggregate purchase price of $1,000,000.00.
(FAC, ¶¶ 21-23; Exh. C.)  In addition, Society
One purchased 584,795 shares for $333,333.33 (paying $83,333.33 in cash and
$250,000 through a Secured Promissory Note, maturing on August 31, 2023). GTV
purchased 1,169,951 shares for $666,666.67 (paying $166,666.67 in cash and $500,000
through a Secured Promissory Note, maturing on August 31, 2023.) Under the terms
of the CSPA, Society One purchased 5,994,155 shares of common stock of Faith7
directly from Faith7 and GTV purchased 11,998,309 shares in exchange for
$359,650 in cash, payable within one day of closing. (FAC, ¶ 24.)  Tamashiro and Bautista allege that GTV and
Society One failed or refused to pay the Promissory Notes when they matured in
August 2023. (FAC, ¶ 26.) GTV and Society One allege that they proposed a
reduction in the amount due on the Promissory Notes because Bautista fraudulently
induced them to assume a 75% ownership in Chime TV under the guise that another
investor named “Fletcher” was offering to purchase Chime TV. (FACC ¶¶ 30-48.)
GTV and Society One allege that Bautista and Tamashiro selectively shared
financial records during the due diligence investigation and failed to disclose
the NAAC Lawsuit. (FACC, ¶ 44.) GTV and Society One allege that when the NAAC Lawsuit
became public, relationships tarnished between Chime TV and advertisers like
Toyota and cable networks like Comcast and AT&T. (FACC, ¶44.) Upon learning
that Bautista entered multi-year licensing contracts on Chime TV’s behalf and
discovering that Bautista’s representation of “Fletcher’s” investment was false,
Cheng asked Bautista to voluntary resign and she refused. (FACC, ¶¶ 48-53.) The
basis of Cross-Complainants GTV and Society One’s claims are that but for
Cross-Defendants’ misrepresentations, they would not have undertaken the
acquisition of Chime TV.
 
B.    Procedural Background
On September 19, 2023, Cross-Defendants Bautista and Tamashiro initiated
this action against Defendants, and DOES 1 through 15 alleging the following
causes of action: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Account Stated; (3) Specific
Performance and (4) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing.
On November 30, 2023, the Complaint was amended to add a fifth cause of action
for Conversion. 
On January 15, 2024, Cross-Complainants answered Cross Defendants’ FAC,
raising 24 affirmative defenses. 
On January 17, 2024, Defendants filed a Cross-Complaint alleging the
following seven causes of action: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Fraud and Deceit;
(3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty (Direct); (4) Breach of Fiduciary Duty
(Derivative);  (5) Breach of Duty of
Loyalty (Direct); (6) Breach of Duty of Loyalty (Derivative); and (7) Violation
of Penal Code Section 496. On February 16, 2024, Defendants filed the First
Amended Cross-Complaint (“FACC”).
On January 2, 2024, Cross-Complainants made a demand on Chime TV’s Board
of Directors to take legal action against Cross-Defendants, which the Board of
Directors denied. (FACC, ¶¶ 10-12.)
On March 28, 2024, Cross-Defendants filed a Demurrer to Defendant’s FACC,
supported by the filed declaration of Defendant’s Counsel, Jonathan Elia, and
demurring on the following grounds: (1) uncertainty as to the entire FACC; (2) failure
to state a cause of action for Breach of Contract; (3) failure to state a cause
of action for Fraud and Deceit; (4) dismissal of the Breach of Fiduciary Duty
(Direct) and  Breach of Duty of Loyalty
(Direct) causes of action; and (5) a lack of standing and failure to state
facts sufficient to support a cause of action for Violation of Penal Code
Section 496.
On June 14, 2024, Cross-Defendants Opposed the Demurrer to the FACC on
the following grounds: (1) Cross Defendants are familiar with exhibits at
issue; (2) Breach of Contract cause of action pleads sufficient facts to be
valid; (3) Fraud and Deceit cause of action pleads sufficient facts to be valid;
and (4) the Violation of Penal Code Section 496 cause of action pleads
sufficient facts to be valid.
On June 21, 2024, Cross-Defendants replied to Cross-Complainant’s Opposition
(1) reaffirming the demurrer on the First Cause of Action for Breach of
Contract and (2) demurring the Second Cause of action for Fraud and Deceit as
insufficiently pled, (3) alleging the Third and Fifth Causes of action are
subject to dismissal per meet and confer discussions, (4) and demurring on the
alleged Violation of Penal Code Section 496 remains insufficiently pled. 
The hearing for the instant motions is set for June 28, 2024.
 
II.            
DEMURRER
A.    Legal Standard
Code Civ. Proc. §430.10(e) provides
for a demurrer on the basis that a complaint fails to state a cause of action. A
demurrer admits, provisionally for purposes of testing the pleading, all
material facts properly pleaded. Tindell
v. Murphy (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 1239, 1247. A demurrer is treated as
“admitting all material facts properly pleaded,” but not the truth of “contentions,
deductions or conclusions of law.” Aubry
v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.
The general rule on demurrer is
that the pleadings are “deemed to be true, however improbable they may be.” Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials
Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.4th 593, 604.
Questions of plaintiff’s ability to
prove unlikely allegations are of no concern. Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp.
(1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 213-214.
A demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of a complaint. Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.  A plaintiff’s allegations must be accepted as
true for purposes of demurrer, no matter how “improbable” they are. Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials
Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 (Del
E. Webb). Allegations need not be accepted as true if they are contradicted
by judicially noticeable facts. Cansino
v. Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1474. 
Pleadings are to be broadly
construed (Code Civ. Proc. §452) and demurrers are to be overruled where the
facts are sufficient to state any cause of action. Quelimane Co. v. Stewart
Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38.
 
B.    Meet and Confer Requirement Met
Before filing a demurrer, the
demurring party is required to meet and confer with the party who filed the
pleading demurred to for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be
reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.41(a).)   
Counsel for Cross-Defendants,
Jonathan J. Elia, Esq., attempted to meet and confer with Cross-Complainant on
March 14, 2024. (Elia Decl., ¶¶ 8-9; Exhs. A, B.) 
The Court finds Defendant’s
attempts to meet and confer are sufficient for purposes of the instant motion.
 
III.      ANALYSIS
A.    Uncertainty of the First Amended
Cross Complaint
The FACC is uncertain because
Cross-Complainants neglect to attach the referenced Exhibits A-D to the FACC.
Code Civ. Proc. §430.10(f) provides
for a demurrer where a pleading is uncertain. 
Demurrers for uncertainty are
disfavored and are only sustained where a pleading is so incomprehensible a
defendant cannot reasonably respond. (A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best Contractors,
Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695; Khoury v. Maly’s of California
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  “The
objection of uncertainty does not go to the failure to allege sufficient
facts.”  (Brea v.¿McGlashan¿(1934)
3 Cal.App.2d 454, 459.)  “It goes to the
doubt as to what the pleader means by the facts alleged.” (Id.)  “Such a demurrer should not be sustained
where the allegations of the complaint are sufficiently clear to apprise the
defendant of the issues which he is to meet.” 
(People v. Lim¿(1941) 18 Cal.2d 872, 882.)¿¿
A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 C3d 311, 318, 216 CR 718, 721; Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 CA4th 968, 994, 11 CR3d 45, 64 (citing text)]
 “Face of the complaint” includes matters shown
in exhibits attached to the complaint and incorporated by reference, or in a
superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189
CA3d 91, 94, 234 CR 178, 179-180); Barnett v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co.
(2001) 90 CA4th 500, 505, 108 CR2d 657, 659 — “we rely on and accept as true
the contents of the exhibits and treat as surplusage the pleader's allegations
as to the legal effect of the exhibits.” 
Where a demurrer is made upon this
ground, it must distinctly specify exactly how or why the pleading is
uncertain, and where such uncertainty appears (by reference to page and line
numbers of the complaint). (See Fenton v. Groveland Comm. Services Dist.
(1982) 135 CA3d 797, 809, 185 CR 758, 765 (disapproved on other grounds by Katzberg
v. Regents of Univ. of Calif. (2002) 29 C4th 300, 328, 127 CR2d 482, 504,
fn. 30)]
Cross-Defendants’ demurrer is based
on uncertainty because the FACC references Exhibits A through D but fails to attach
the referenced exhibits to the pleading. (Demurrer, pp. 5-6.) Cross-Defendants
recognize that Exhibits A-D were attached to the original Cross-Complaint filed
January 17, 2024, but missing from the FACC. (Id.)  
Cross-Complainants argue that Cross-Defendants
are familiar with the referenced exhibits because Cross-Defendants were
previously provided with Exhibits A-D. (Opp’n., p. 7.) Cross-Complainants
concede that if granted leave to file a Second Amended Cross-Complaint (“SACC”),
the relevant exhibits will be attached. (Id.)
            Cross-Defendants
do not allege that the pleading is so incomprehensible that they cannot
respond, indeed they did respond. Since there is a possibility of curing this
defect, Cross-Defendants’ demurrer as to the entire FACC is sustained with
leave to amend. While this ruling is dispositive of the entire complaint, in
the interest of judicial economy, the Court will address the deficiencies in
the other causes of action.
 
B.    First Cause of Action: Breach of
Contract 
The FACC does not state a cause of action for breach of contract because the
facts to support Cross-Defendants’ breach are insufficiently pled. To state a
cause of action for breach of contract, Plaintiff must be able to establish
“(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the
plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811,
821.)
If a breach of contract claim “is based on alleged breach of a written
contract, the terms must be set out verbatim in the body of the complaint or a
copy of the written agreement must be attached and incorporated by reference.”
(Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 307.)
In some circumstances, a plaintiff may also “plead the legal effect of the
contract rather than its precise language.” (Construction Protective
Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198-199.)
Cross-Complainants’ cause of action
for breach of contract is based on Cross-Defendants’ alleged breach of the
executed STA, dated May 2023. (FACC, ¶ 55.) Cross-Complainants’ allege section
2.1 of the STA was violated when the NAAC Lawsuit was filed because the pending
suit subjected the Faith7 common stock shares to a lien.
2.1 Ownership of Shares.
Seller is the sole record and beneficial owner of the Shares, and such Shares
are to be sold pursuant to this Agreement. Except as set forth in the Prior
Investment Agreements, which will terminate upon Closing, the Shares are not
subject to any lien, charge, pledge, claim, restrictions on transfer,
mortgage, security interest, or title defect or other encumbrance of any sort
or to any rights of first refusal, and Seller has not granted any rights to
purchase the Shares to any other person or entity. (emphasis added)
(FACC, ¶ 55.)
As of June 27, 2024, the NAAC Lawsuit is pending before Department 51
in the Stanley Mosk Courthouse with no judgment rendered and no writ of attachment
filed. The Court finds no case law to support the argument that a
pending lawsuit functions as a “lien” unless and until a final judgment is
issued or a writ of attachment is filed.
In opposition, Cross-Complainants argue
that Cross-Defendant Bautista “affirmatively represented that the shares to be
sold to Cross-Complainants are not subject to any claim, title
defect, or other encumbrance of any sort.” Because the FACC grounds its breach
allegation on a lien theory, Cross-Complainants have not alleged sufficient
facts to state a cause of action for breach of contract. 
Based on the foregoing, Cross-Defendants’
demurrer to the first cause of action for breach of contract is sustained, with
leave to amend. 
 
C.    Second Cause of Action: Fraud
The FACC does not meet the elevated pleading standard for fraud.
Pleadings are to be broadly construed (Code Civ. Proc. §452) and
demurrers are to be overruled where the facts are sufficient to state any cause
of action. (Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19
Cal.4th 26, 38.) 
Each element must be pleaded with particularity. (Glaski v. Bank of
America (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1079, 1090; Heritage Pacific Financial,
LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 989.) Fraud actions are subject
to “strict requirements of particularity in pleading.  . . . Accordingly, the rule is followed
everywhere that fraud must be specifically pleaded. The effect of this rule is
twofold: (a) General pleading of the legal conclusion of ‘fraud’ is
insufficient; the facts constituting the fraud must be alleged. (b) Every
element of the cause of action for fraud must be alleged in the proper manner
(i.e., factually and specifically), and the policy of liberal construction of
the pleadings ... will not ordinarily be invoked to sustain a pleading
defective in any material respect.” (Committee on Children’s Television,
Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 216, superseded by
statute on other grounds.) 
A fraud cause of action must contain: “(1) a knowingly false
representation by the defendant; (2) an intent to deceive or induce reliance;
(3) justifiable reliance by the plaintiff; and (4) resulting damages.” (Service
by Medallion, Inc. v. Clorox Co. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816.) 
Fraud based on concealment requires that “(1) the defendant must have
concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant must have been under
a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the defendant must have
intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to defraud the
plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of the fact and would not
have acted as he did if he had known of the concealed or suppressed fact, and
(5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact, the plaintiff
must have sustained damage.”  (Bigler-Engler
v. Breg, Inc. (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th 276, 310-311.)  Less specificity is required to plead fraud
by concealment.  (Ibid.) “Even under the
strict rules of common law pleading, one of the canons was that less
particularity is required when the facts lie more in the knowledge of the
opposite party.” (Alfaro v. Community Housing Improvement System &
Planning Assn., Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1384.)
Cross-Complainants’ second cause of action is against all
Cross-Defendants for fraud and deceit. (FACC, ¶ 60.) Cross-Complainants argue
that Cross-Defendants Bautista and Tamashiro intentionally concealed a material
fact, i.e., the filing of the NAAC Lawsuit and its negative impact on potential
investors to induce Cross-Complainants to invest in Chime TV. (Id.)
Cross-Complainants also identify Cross-Defendants as “fiduciaries” to Cross-Complainants,
“under a duty to disclose to disclose the NAAC Lawsuit … and its impact on
investors”. (FACC ¶ 61.)
Cross-Complainants failed to allege sufficient facts to support their
fraud-based cause of action. Cross-Complainants appear to be proceeding on a
theory of fraudulent concealment. The cause of action is not alleged with
sufficient factual specificity to support fraud.
The allegations are made collectively as to
all Cross-Defendants. Even in naming Bautista and Tamashiro, Cross-Complainants
do not identify which individual
intentionally suppressed material facts, when, and by what means. In addition, Cross-Complainants
failed to allege facts supporting the existence of a fiduciary duty for
purposes of the concealment cause of action. 


Accordingly, Cross-Complainant’s demurrer to the fourth cause of action
for fraud is sustained, with leave to amend.
 
D.    Third Cause of Action: Breach of
Fiduciary Duty (Direct) And Fifth Cause of Action: Breach of Duty of Loyalty
(Direct)
            The stockholder's individual suit is
a suit to enforce a right against the corporation which the stockholder
possesses as an individual. (Paclink Communications Internat. v. Superior
Court, 90 Cal. App. 4th 958, 960.) Where conduct, including mismanagement by corporate officers, causes
damage to the corporation, it is the entity that must bring suit; the
individual shareholder may not bring an action for indirect personal losses
(i.e., decrease in stock value) sustained as a result of the overall harm to
the entity. (Schrage v. Schrage, 69 Cal. App. 5th 126, 126.)
 
                                                 
i.     Third Cause of Action: Breach of
Fiduciary Duty (Direct)
“The elements of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty are the
existence of a fiduciary relationship, breach of fiduciary duty, and damages.”
(Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 820.)
A fiduciary duty is founded upon a special relationship imposed by law or
when “confidence is reposed by persons in the integrity of others,” who
voluntarily accept the confidence.  (Tri-Growth
Centre City, Ltd. v. Silldorf, Burdman, Duignan & Eisenberg (1989) 216
Cal.App.3d 1139, 1150; see CACI 4100, et seq.) “‘[B]efore a person can be
charged with a fiduciary obligation, he must either knowingly undertake to act
on behalf and for the benefit of another, or must enter into a relationship
which imposes that undertaking as a matter of law.’” (City of Hope Nat’l
Med. Ctr. v. Genentech (2008) 43 Cal.4th 375, 386.)
“[B]ecause of ‘[t]he vagueness of the common law definition of the
confidential relation that gives rise to a fiduciary duty, and the range of the
relationships that can potentially be characterized as fiduciary,’ the
‘essential elements’ have been distilled as follows: ‘1) The vulnerability of
one party to the other which 2) results in the empowerment of the stronger
party by the weaker which 3) empowerment has been solicited or accepted by the
stronger party and 4) prevents the weaker party from effectively protecting
itself.’ (Richelle L. v. Roman Catholic Archbishop (2003) 106
Cal.App.4th 257, 272 (“Richelle”).)  In
short, vulnerability ‘is the necessary predicate of a confidential relation,’
and ‘the law treats [it] as “absolutely essential”’…” (Persson v. Smart
Inventions (2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1161.)
            Cross-Complainants’ breach of fiduciary duty cause of action is based on
the following allegations: (1) Cross-Defendants were “directors and officers of
Chime TV (f/k/a Faith 7) … individuals tasked with overseeing its operations”,
(2) Cross-Defendants owed fiduciary duties to Cross-Complainants, (3)
Cross-Defendants breached that duty by misappropriating Chime TV’s assets for
“personal and/or non-business-related expenses”, (4) harming Cross-Complainants,
and (5) entitling them to a punitive damage award. (FACC ¶¶ 67-73.)
            Cross-Complainants fail to allege
sufficient facts to support the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action.
Cross-Complainants fail to allege facts suggesting Cross-Defendants owed
Cross-Complainants fiduciary duties based on the transaction.
Cross-Complainants bring this claim against all Cross-Defendants and do not
allege how each Cross-Defendant owed them a duty, beyond stating their roles as
directors and officers of Chime TV. 
Based on the foregoing, Cross-Defendants’ demurrer to the third cause of
action for breach of fiduciary duty (direct) is sustained, with leave to amend.

 
                                               
ii.     Fifth Cause of Action: Breach of Duty
of Loyalty (Direct)
The elements of a cause of action for breach of the duty of loyalty of
persons employed in positions of trust, by analogy to a claim for breach of
fiduciary duty, are (1) the existence of a relationship giving rise to a duty
of loyalty, (2) one or more breaches of that duty, and (3) damage proximately
caused by that breach. Huong Que, Inc. v. Luu, 150 Cal. App. 4th 400, 58 (2007)
To state a cause of action for a breach of the duty of loyalty, the
plaintiff must plead: (1) The existence of a relationship giving rise to a duty
of loyalty; (2) one or more breaches of that duty; and (3) damage proximately
caused by that breach. (Huong Que, Inc. v. Luu (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th
400, 410.) The duty of loyalty does not depend upon contract, but the nature of
the parties’ relationship. Such a relationship includes agent-principal,
attorney-client, employer-employee, trustee-trustor, director-shareholder,
partners-partnership. (See CACI 4102.)
 
Cross-Complainants’ breach of duty of loyalty claim is based on the
following allegations: (1) as directors and officers of Chime TV,
Cross-Defendants owed Cross-Complainants a duty of loyalty, obligating
Cross-Defendants to refrain from self-dealing, (2) Cross-Defendants
misappropriated Chime TV’s funds for personal use and acted “intentionally and/
or recklessly”, (4) causing damage to Cross-Complainants. (FACC, ¶¶ 83-87.)
Cross-Complainants have not sufficiently stated a cause of action for
breach of the duty of loyalty because they have not alleged facts supporting
the existence of a fiduciary duty between themselves and Cross-Defendants. Cross-Complainants
do not allege any facts to show that they held a special relationship of
director-shareholder or partners to invoke such duties.  
Based on the foregoing, Cross-Defendants’ demurrer to the fifth cause of
action for breach of the duty of loyalty (direct) is sustained, with leave to
amend. 
 
E.    Fourth Cause of Action: Breach of
Fiduciary Duty (Derivative) And Sixth Cause of Action: Breach of Duty of
Loyalty (Derivative)
Under California law, ‘a shareholder cannot bring a direct action for
damages against management on the theory their alleged wrongdoing decreased the
value of his or her stock (e.g., by reducing corporate assets and net worth).
The corporation itself must bring such an action, or a derivative suit may be
brought on the corporation's behalf.’ [Citation.] A different rule would
‘authorize multitudinous litigation and ignore the corporate entity.’” (Schuster
v. Gardner (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 305, 312 [25 Cal. Rptr. 3d 468]; accord, Grosset
v. Wenaas, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 1108.) 
“An action is deemed derivative ‘“if the gravamen of the complaint is
injury to the corporation, or to the whole body of its stock and property
without any severance or distribution among individual holders, or it seeks to
recover assets for the corporation or to prevent the dissipation of its
assets.” (Heshejin v. Rostami, 54 Cal. App. 5th 984, 994.)
A breach of fiduciary duty cause of action based on mismanagement of the
corporation resulting in the diminution of value of the corporation is a
derivative claim. (Schrage v. Schrage, (2021) 69 Cal.App.5th 155,156.)
To bring or maintain a derivative action, Corporations Code section 800,
subdivision (b)(1), 19 requires the plaintiff to own stock at the time of the
challenged action—subject to an exception referred to as “the continuing wrong
doctrine.” (Kruss v. Booth (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 699, 724–725) as well
as when the action is filed and throughout the duration of the litigation. (See
Grosset v. Wenaas (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1100, 1119.) (Favila v. Katten
Muchin Rosenman LLP, 188 Cal. App. 4th 189, 214.) 
Because a derivative claim does not belong to the stockholder asserting
it, standing to maintain such a claim is justified only by the stockholder
relationship and the indirect benefits made possible thereby, which furnish the
stockholder with an interest and incentive to seek redress for injury to the
corporation. [Citations.] Once this relationship ceases to exist, the
derivative plaintiff lacks standing because he or she ‘no longer has a
financial interest in any recovery pursued for the benefit of the corporation.’
[Citations.] As one court put it, allowing a plaintiff to retain standing
despite the loss of stock ownership would produce ‘the anomalous result that a
plaintiff with absolutely no “dog in the hunt” is permitted to pursue a right
of action that belongs solely to the corporation.’(Favila, at 214.) 
Cross-Complainants derivative cause of action for breach of duty of
loyalty and breach of fiduciary duty arise from the following allegations: (1) as
directors and officers of Chime TV Cross-Defendant Bautista and Tamashiro owed
Cross-Complainants duties, (2) Cross-Defendants breached those duties by misappropriating
funds belonging to Chime TV by using Chime TV’s assets and accounts to pay for
hundreds of thousands of Cross-Defendants’ non-business-related expenses
without shareholder knowledge, and failing to ensure timely payment of debts to
vendors, (3) causing harm to Cross-Complainants. (FACC, ¶¶ 74-81, 90-93).
Cross-Defendants demur to the derivative claims under the premise that
Cross-Complainants lack standing. Because Cross-Complainants alleged that
Cross-Defendant breached their fiduciary duties by misappropriating the funds
of Chime TV, any recovery would be awarded to Chime TV, not to
Cross-Complainants. 
Based on the alleged harm to Chime TV, Cross-Complainants were required
to satisfy the pre-suit requirements set forth in Corporations Code § 800(b)(1)
due to a premature relationship and § 800(b)(2) for failure to state with
specificity their efforts to inform the Board of Directors to bring this cross
complaint. 
Cross-Complainants lack derivative standing because the relationship
between them and the corporation had not yet formed since Cross-Complainants
did not become shareholders of Chime TV until the May 30, 2023 STA and CSPA
became effective. On January 2, 2024, Cross-Complainants made a demand on Chime
TV’s Board of Directors to take legal action against Cross-Defendants, which
the Board of Directors denied. (FACC, ¶¶ 10-12.)
Accordingly, the Demurrer to the fourth cause of action for breach of
fiduciary duty (derivative) is sustained with leave to amend, and;
Cross-Defendants’ Demurrer to the sixth cause of action for breach of
duty of loyalty (derivative) is sustained with leave to amend.
 
F.    Seventh Cause of Action: Violation of
Penal Code § 496
Every person who buys or receives any property that has been stolen or
that has been obtained in any manner constituting theft or extortion, knowing
the property to be so stolen or obtained, or who conceals, sells, withholds, or
aids in concealing, selling, or withholding any property from the owner,
knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained, shall be punished by
imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or imprisonment
pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170. However, if the value of the
property does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950), the offense shall
be a misdemeanor, punishable only by imprisonment in a county jail not
exceeding one year, if such person has no prior convictions for an offense
specified in clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision
(e) of Section 667 or for an offense requiring registration pursuant to
subdivision (c) of Section 290. (Cal. Pen. Code § 496)
            Pursuant to the plain language of
section 496, an intangible ownership interest in a company does not constitute
"property." (See In re Ethan C. (2012) 54 Cal. 4th 610, 627
(statutory language should be given its usual and ordinary meaning, and
ordinarily the plain meaning of the statute governs). This situation should be
contrasted from Siry Investment, LP. v. Farkhondehpour (2022) 13 Cal.5th
333, which involved the fraudulent diversion of tangible partnership funds.
The basis of Cross-Complainants’ allegations is that (1) Cross-Defendants
knowingly received, possessed, concealed, and/or withheld monies belonging to Chime
TV, (2) that Chime TV sustained damages as a result; and (3)Chime TV and its
shareholders are entitled to treble damages and attorneys’ fees. (FACC, ¶¶
95-97.)
The above allegations are uncertain and insufficient to allege a
violation of Penal Code section 496 because Cross-Complainants fail to plead sufficient
facts of tangible property. Specifically, Cross-Complainants allege that Cross-Defendants
Faith Bautista and Roes 1 through 11 “stole Chime TV’s assets and monies
to pay for hundreds of thousands of dollars of Cross-Defendants’ personal
and/or non-business-related expenses without shareholder knowledge or
consent”. (FACC, ¶ 95.)
Notably, the FACC does not allege which assets or monies belonged to
Chime TV, nor how Cross-Defendant Bautista personally obtained possession of
the funds. 
Instead, the allegations against Cross-Defendant Bautista rely entirely
on a possible agency relationship with Chime TV, rooted in an intangible
ownership interest – the common stock shares of Chime TV (f/k/a Faith7) which
are intangible and possess an unascertainable value. 
Accordingly, the Demurrer to the seventh cause of action for violation of
Penal Code § 496 is sustained without leave to amend.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER            Cross-Defendants’ Demurrer is
SUSTAINED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND as to all causes of action, except the 7th cause of action, for which the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
Cross-Complainants have 20 days to
file a second amended complaint. 
Cross-Defendant to give notice.
