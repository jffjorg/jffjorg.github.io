And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion for consolidation of cases 23TRCV03119 and 23IWUD01847 without prejudice. The cases involve a civil complaint filed by Anthony Hunter against Flagstar Bank, N.A. and Lakeview Loan Servicing, LLC, and an unlawful detainer complaint filed by First Capital Investments Corporation against Anthony Hunter. The court notes that the cases have not been deemed related and therefore cannot be consolidated, as Judgment has already been entered in the unlawful detainer case. The motion is thus denied without prejudice, and the plaintiff is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
