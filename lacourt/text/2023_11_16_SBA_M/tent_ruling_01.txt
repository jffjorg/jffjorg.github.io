BACKGROUND
            23TRCV03119
In 23TRCV03119, on September 20,
2023, plaintiff Anthony Hunter filed a complaint against Flagstar Bank, N.A.
and Lakeview Loan Servicing, LLC for violations of Civil Code §2923.5, et seq.,
wrongful foreclosure, unfair business practices, and cancellation of written
instruments.
On October 4, 2023, plaintiff
Hunter filed the motion for consolidation.
            23IWUD01847
In 23IWUD01847, on August 18, 2023,
plaintiff First Capital Investments Corporation filed an unlawful detainer
complaint against Anthony Hunter based on a three-day notice to quit due to
foreclosure.
On September 11, 2023, plaintiff
First Capital filed a FAC.
On October 4, 2023, the parties
entered into a stipulation for entry of judgment for plaintiff’s possession of
the premises and the court so ordered and entered judgment.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
CCP §1048 states:  “When actions involving a common question of
law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial
of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions
consolidated and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may
tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.”
CCP §1049 states:  “An action is deemed to be pending from the
time of its commencement until its final determination upon appeal, or until
the time for appeal has passed, unless the judgment is sooner satisfied.”
Under California Rules of Court
Rule 3.350(a)(1), a notice of motion to consolidate must:     (A) List all named parties in each case,
the names of those who have appeared, and the names of their respective
attorneys of record; (B) Contain the captions of all the cases sought to be
consolidated, with the lowest numbered case shown first; and (C) Be filed in
each case sought to be consolidated.  (2)
The motion to consolidate:  (A) Is deemed
a single motion for the purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but
memorandums, declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in
the lowest numbered case; (B) Must be served on all attorneys of record and all
non-represented parties in all of the cases sought to be consolidated; and (C)
Must have a proof of service filed as part of the motion.
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff in the herein case
23TRCV03119 (civil case) requests that the court consolidate it with the
unlawful detainer case in 23IWUD01847.
The court notes that the cases have
not been deemed related and thus, the cases cannot be consolidated.  Further, the court notes that judgment has
been entered in the UD case based on stipulation.
The motion is thus DENIED WITHOUT
PREJUDICE.
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice
of the ruling.
