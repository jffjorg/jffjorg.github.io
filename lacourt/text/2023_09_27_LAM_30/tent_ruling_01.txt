Health Care, Inc., et. al., Case
No. 23STCV05812
                        
Tentative Ruling
re:  Defendant’s Demurrer to First
Amended Complaint
 
            Defendant
Harbor Health Care, Inc. (Defendant) demurs to the first and second causes of
action in Plaintiff Joann Callanta’s (Plaintiff) First Amended Complaint (FAC).
The demurrer is sustained.
 
In reviewing the legal sufficiency of a complaint against a demurrer, a
court will treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,
but not contentions, deductions, or conclusions of law. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 (Blank); C & H Foods Co.
v. Hartford Ins. Co. (1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 1055, 1062.) It is well settled
that a “demurrer lies only for defects appearing on the face of the
complaint[.]” (Stevens v. Superior Court
(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 594, 601.) “The rules by which the sufficiency of a
complaint is tested against a general demurrer are well settled. We not only
treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but also
give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its
parts in their context.” (Guclimane Co.
v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38 (internal quotes
omitted).) For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, the complaint must be
construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the facts pleaded. (Wilner v. Sunset Life Ins. Co. (2000) 78
Cal.App.4th 952, 958.)
When ruling on a demurrer, the Court may only consider the complaint’s
allegations or matters which may be judicially noticed. (Blank, supra, 39 Cal.3d at 318.) The Court may not consider any
other extrinsic evidence or judge the credibility of the allegations plead or
the difficulty a plaintiff may have in proving his allegations. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110
Cal.App.3d 868, 881.) A demurrer is properly sustained only when the complaint,
liberally construed, fails to state facts sufficient to constitute any cause of
action. (Kramer v. Intuit Inc. (2004)
121 Cal.App.4th 574, 578.)
 
The factual allegations in the FAC
are unchanged from the Complaint. Defendant operates residential care
facilities for the disabled at locations in Southern California. (FAC ¶ 7.) Plaintiff
was hired by Defendant on September 7, 2021, in the position of
“QIDP/Administrator” at Defendant’s location in Bellflower, California. (FAC ¶
8.) Plaintiff’s duties involved overseeing staffing, scheduling and filling in
for direct care staff, and checking clients. (FAC ¶ 9.) During her employment, Plaintiff
reported to Cheryl Loflin (Loflin), Defendant’s President and CEO. (FAC ¶ 9.)
Plaintiff was terminated on November 4, 2021. (FAC ¶ 17.)
 
Plaintiff’s first and second causes
of action are for Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy and
whistleblower retaliation under Labor Code § 1102.5, respectively. Under her
wrongful termination claim, Plaintiff alleges that she was terminated based on
her reports of Defendant’s unlawful activity, including violations of  standards for elderly residential care
facilities. (FAC ¶ 36.) Plaintiff’s claim under Labor Code § 1102.5 similarly
alleges that she was terminated due to “her complaints about understaffing and
patient safety [which] disclosed unlawful activity by Defendant.” (FAC ¶ 51.)
 
Under California law, “a common law
tort cause of action exists for at-will employees against employers who
discharge them in violation of
fundamental public policy.
. . . ‘It is settled that an employer's discharge of an employee in violation of a fundamental public policy
embodied in a constitutional or statutory provision gives rise to a tort
action.’ [Citation.] In particular, ‘[t]ermination of an employee most clearly violates public policy when it contravenes the provision of a
statute forbidding termination for a specified reason...’ [Citation.]” (Prue
v. Brady Co./San Diego, Inc. (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1367, 1377; see Tameny
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 167.)
 
Labor
Code § 1102.5 forbids “[a]n employer, or any person acting on behalf of the
employer,” from retaliating against an employee for disclosing information “to
a government or law enforcement agency, to a person with authority over the
employee or another employee who has the authority to investigate, discover, or
correct the violation or noncompliance . . . if the employee has reasonable
cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of state or federal
statute, or a violation of or noncompliance with a local, state, or federal
rule or regulation, regardless of whether disclosing the information is part of
the employee's job duties.” (Labor Code § 1102.5, subd. (b).)
“To establish a prima facie case for
whistleblower liability, a plaintiff must show that he or she was subjected to
adverse employment action after engaging in protected activity and that there
was a causal connection between the two.’ [Citation.] Protected activity is the
disclosure of or opposition to ‘a violation of state or federal statute,
or a violation or noncompliance with a state or federal rule or regulation.’
” (Edgerly v. City of Oakland (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1191, 1199.)
Plaintiff’s wrongful
termination and retaliation claims are based on two alleged complaints she made
to Loflin, both attached to the FAC. First, on October 18, 2021, “Cheryl Loflin
texted Plaintiff that Plaintiff was effectively ‘on-call’ to answer staff
questions and cover for staff, including direct care staff, on weekends and
Plaintiff’s posted days off. Plaintiff texted in response complaining that
Plaintiff had a ‘right to rest and choose calls that are important.’ ” (FAC ¶ 13,
Ex. 1.)
Second, on October
26, 2021, Plaintiff emailed Loflin about a direct care staff member “refusing
to cover shifts and threatening to quit.” (FAC ¶ 15, Ex. 2.) In the email,
Plaintiff writes that the staff member “complaints about the company a lot” and
is “on the phone all the time,” and complaints of understaffing: “I[‘ve] been
filling in during my first two weeks of hire. But I can’t be doing this all the
time. . . . The house needs a staff that are open to fill in during emergency
or extend hours at least. But none of the staff wants to do extra.” Plaintiff’s
email ends, “[t]he staffing problem will not be resolved if staff are not open
to fill in and with no steady nurse we will place the [patient] at risk, we
have [had] 3 hospitalizations.” (FAC ¶ 15, Ex. 2.)
The Court sustained
Defendant’s prior demurrer to Plaintiff’s whistleblower retaliation claim based
on Plaintiff’s failure to allege disclosure of information that could
reasonably be believed to be a violation of state or federal statute, or of a
local, state, or federal rule or regulation. In the FAC, Plaintiff now alleges
that her complaints disclosed violations of Health & Safety Code §§
1276.4-1275.5, “which empower the State Department of Public Health to set
forth minimum standards in residential care facilities for the elderly, such as
nurse-to-patient ratios, daily minimum hours of care for residents, and
qualifications for staff,” as well as violations of 22 CCR §§ 87468.1-87468.2,
which provide general rights of safety and care for residents in residential
care facilities for the elderly. (FAC ¶ 12.)
            The Court finds that Plaintiff’s communications did not constitute
the type of disclosures that are protected under Section 1102.5. In the first
set of messages, Plaintiff complained to Loflin about her schedule and her
duties. (FAC ¶ 13, Ex. 1.) In the second, Plaintiff’s complains about the
specific staff member’s behavior and staff members’ unwillingness to work
overtime. (FAC ¶ 15, Ex. 2.) These communications concern only “internal
personnel matters,” and thus are not protected under Section 1102.5. (Patten
v. Grant Joint Union High School Dist. (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1385, disapproved
of on other grounds by Lawson v. PPG Architectural Finishes, Inc. (2022)
12 Cal.5th 703.) In the messages, Plaintiff “is not making a report concerning
an alleged violation of law, even if she reasonably thinks it could somehow
amount to one.” (Rodriguez v. Laboratory Corporation of America (C.D.
Cal. 2022) 623 F.Supp.3d 1047, 1055.) Rather, Plaintiff’s complaints relate to personnel
matters, for instance, that “[t]he schedule in this triplex . . . [has] been
problematic” and “none of the staff wants to do extra [hours].” (FAC, Ex. 2.) 
In Opposition, Plaintiff argues that an
employee need only have a good faith belief that she is disclosing violations
of law to support liability, regardless of whether the belief was correct or
reasonable. Plaintiff’s argument misstates the decision in Diego v. Pilgrim
United Church of Christ (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 913, where the court noted
that a wrongful termination claim based on a Section 1102.5 violation may lie when
an employer mistakenly believes that the employee “might disclose
or has disclosed a violation of state regulations to a governmental agency,”
even if the employee did not in fact file a complaint.  (Id. at 924.) This does not apply to
the facts pled. Furthermore,  the text of
Section 1102.5 expressly requires that the employee have “reasonable cause to
believe that the information discloses a violation” of law. (Lab. Code §
1102.5, subd. (b).) Accordingly, Plaintiff’s first and second causes of action
both fail.
