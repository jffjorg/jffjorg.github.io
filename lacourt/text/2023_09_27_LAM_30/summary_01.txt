```

Summary:
The judge's tentative ruling sustains Defendant's demurrer to Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint, dismissing Plaintiff's wrongful termination and retaliation claims. The Court finds that Plaintiff's communications with Loflin about her schedule and duties, as well as her complaints about understaffing and patient safety, do not constitute protected disclosures under California Labor Code § 1102.5. The Court holds that Plaintiff's complaints relate to personnel matters, rather than alleged violations of law, and that Plaintiff failed to allege disclosure of information that could reasonably be believed to be a violation of state or federal statute, or of a local, state, or federal rule or regulation.
