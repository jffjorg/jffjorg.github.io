The Court holds that Plaintiff's complaints relate to personnel matters, rather than alleged violations of law, and that Plaintiff failed to allege disclosure of information that could reasonably be believed to be a violation of state or federal statute, or of a local, state, or federal rule or regulation.

**English Summary:**

The Judge has decided to sustain (reject) the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's claims of wrongful termination and whistleblower retaliation. The Judge found that the plaintiff's complaints to her supervisor about scheduling and staffing issues did not qualify as protected whistleblowing under California law.  

The Judge stated that the plaintiff's complaints were considered internal personnel matters and did not involve disclosures of potential legal violations, which are necessary to make a whistleblower claim under Labor Code § 1102.5. While the plaintiff believed her complaints revealed violations, the Judge emphasized that a genuine "reasonable cause" belief is required for such a claim to be valid.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by Defendant Harbor Health Care, Inc. (Defendant) to Plaintiff Joann Callanta's (Plaintiff) First Amended Complaint (FAC) is sustained. The Plaintiff's first and second causes of action, for wrongful termination in violation of public policy and whistleblower retaliation under Labor Code § 1102.5, respectively, are dismissed.

The judge found that the Plaintiff's complaints to Defendant's President and CEO, Cheryl Loflin, were not protected under Labor Code § 1102.5 because they concerned internal personnel matters, such as staffing issues and scheduling problems, rather than allegations of violations of state or federal law. The judge also noted that the Plaintiff's complaints did not disclose information that could reasonably be believed to be a violation of state or federal statute, or of a local, state, or federal rule or regulation.

The judge's ruling is based on the law, which requires that an employee have "reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation" of law to support a whistleblower retaliation claim. The judge held that the Plaintiff's complaints did not meet this standard, and therefore, the claims were dismissed.
