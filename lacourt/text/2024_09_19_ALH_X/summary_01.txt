Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff's motion for sanctions against Defendant. The case arises from a dispute between Plaintiff Pref Pasadena Collection, LLC and Defendant Pasadena Collection West Property Owner's Association over Defendant's failure to abide by the Declaration of Establishment of Conditions, Covenants, and Restrictions (CC&R) for the Pasadena Collection West. Plaintiff moved for sanctions in the amount of $5,320.00 plus $60.00 filing fee, alleging that Defendant's four motions to quash were frivolous and intended to cause unnecessary delay. The judge denied Plaintiff's motion, finding that Defendant's motions were not brought solely for an improper purpose, but rather in good faith to protect deponents from unreasonable and oppressive demands. The judge also denied Defendant's request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $5,865.00.
