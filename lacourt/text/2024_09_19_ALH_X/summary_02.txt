```

As for the summary, here is a brief summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions and dismisses the plaintiffs' action without prejudice. The plaintiffs failed to comply with discovery requests, including failing to respond to interrogatories, requests for admission, and requests for production of documents. The court previously ordered the plaintiffs to provide responses and pay monetary sanctions, but they did not comply. The judge finds that the plaintiffs' conduct was a misuse of the discovery process and that a terminating sanction is appropriate to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.
