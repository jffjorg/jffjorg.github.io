And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Nancy Martinez's motions to compel responses from Plaintiffs Evan Pugrad, Caroline Draper, and Trenton Hearin to discovery requests, including production of documents, form interrogatories, and special interrogatories. The Plaintiffs failed to provide timely responses, despite multiple extensions granted by the Defendant. The Court orders the Plaintiffs to provide verified responses without objections within 15 days and awards sanctions against each Plaintiff in the amount of $1,234.95. The sanctions are reduced from the original amount of $2,284.95 due to the similar nature of the motions and lack of opposition from the Plaintiffs.
