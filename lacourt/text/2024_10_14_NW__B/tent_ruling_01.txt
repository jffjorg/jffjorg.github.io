  Case Number:  22STCV16662    Hearing Date:   October 14, 2024    Dept:  B SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIACOUNTY OF LOS ANGELESDEPARTMENT BTENTATIVE RULINGEVAN PUGRAD, et al., Plaintiffs, vs. NANCY MARTINEZ, Defendant. Case No.: 22STCV16662 Hearing Date: October 14, 2024Defendant Nancy Martinez (“Defendant”)’s Motions to Compel Plaintiff Caroline Draper (“Draper”)’s responses to Production of Documents, Set One, Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One, are granted. Draper is ordered to provide verified responses without objections within 15 days. Draper is also ordered to pay $1,234.95 in sanctions within 15 days.Defendant’s Motions to Compel Plaintiff Evan Pugrad (“Pugrad”)’s responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Production of Documents, Set One, are granted. Pugrad is ordered to provide verified responses without objections within 15 days. Pugrad is also ordered to pay $1,234.95 in sanctions within 15 days.Defendant’s Motions to Compel Plaintiff Trenton Hearin (“Hearin”)’s responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Production of Documents, Set One, are granted. Hearin is ordered to provide verified responses without objections within 15 days. Hearin is also ordered to pay $1,234.95 in sanctions within 15 days.Defendant moves to compel responses of Plaintiffs Draper, Pugrad, and Hearin (collectively “Plaintiffs”) as to Production of Documents, Set One, Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One (collectively “Discovery Requests”). As to each motion, Petitioner seeks sanctions in the amount of $761.65, comprised of a $61.65 filing fee and four hours of work permotion at a rate of $175 per hour, including an anticipated hour in preparing a reply brief and an additional hour for attending each hearing. These requests total $2,284.95 per Plaintiff.If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290(b).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have been served. All that need be shown in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. (See Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)Where there has been no timely response to a demand for the production of documents, the demanding party may seek an order compelling a response. (CCP § 2031.300(b).) Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product. (CCP § 2031.300(a).) Thus, unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief from waiver, he or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing the motion.“The court shall impose a monetary sanction . . . against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel . . . responses to interrogatories or production demands, absent substantial justification or other circumstances that make imposing the sanctions unjust.” (CCP § 2030.290(c).) Similarly, “[t]he court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (CCP § 2023.030(a).) Misuse of the discovery process includes “[f]ailing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery,” and “[d]isobeying a court order to provide discovery.” (CCP § 2023.010(d) and (g).)Defendant moves to compel Plaintiffs’ responses to discovery because Plaintiffs failed to provide any responses. On November 22, 2023, Defendant propounded Discovery requests on Plaintiffs. (Anderson Decl. ¶ 3; Exh. 1.) Plaintiffs’ discovery responses were initially due on December 27, 2023. (Ibid.at ¶ 4.) Defendant unilaterally granted Plaintiffs an extension of ten days. (Ibid.; Exh. 2.) Noresponse was received. (Ibid.) At a February 28, 2024, case management conference, Defendant granted Plaintiffs a second extension to March 8, 2024. (Ibid. at ¶ 5; Exh. 3.) On June 11, 2024, Defendant granted Plaintiffs a final extension to June 21, 2024. (Ibid.at ¶ 7; Exh. 5.) Defendant has attempted to contact Plaintiffs’ counsel numerous times on this matter, however, to date, counsel has failed to respond to Defendant’s communications or discovery requests. (Ibid. at ¶¶ 3-7.) Here, Plaintiffs failed to timely comply with their discovery obligation because they have failed to provide timely responses to discovery. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are ordered to provide verified responses without objections to Defendant’s Discovery Requests within 15 days of this ruling.In light of Plaintiffs’ total failure to comply with their discovery obligations, the Court orders sanctions in the reduced amount of $411.65 per motion (representing two hours of work at a rate of $175 per hour plus $61.65 filing fee per motion as each motion is substantially similar and no oppositions were filed). Therefore, sanctions are awarded against each Plaintiff in the amount of $1,234.95 ($411.65 x three motions to compel per Plaintiff).It is so ordered. Moving party to give notice.Dated: October 11, 2024Hon. Karen MoskowitzJudge of the Superior Court
