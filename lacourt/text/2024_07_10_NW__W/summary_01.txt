And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for protective order filed by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) to exclude Todd Bloomfield, counsel for the plaintiffs, from the deposition of Curtis Johnson and to limit the scope of the deposition examination. The court has denied the motion, finding that LAUSD has not adequately shown that Mr. Bloomfield's presence at the deposition constitutes unwarranted annoyance, harassment, or oppression. The court has also ruled that the scope of the deposition examination should not be limited to matters relevant to the perpetrator Rene Tenas, as this would bar the plaintiffs from seeking relevant information. The court has, however, suggested that only two attorneys, including Mr. Bloomfield, should be present at the deposition, and that the plaintiffs should elect to have one counsel and Mr. Bloomfield present.
