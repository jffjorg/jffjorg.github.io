And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Sky 2 Freight Systems, Inc.'s motion to deem requests for admission admitted and imposes sanctions on Defendant Valley of the Sun Cosmetics, LLC. The court finds that Defendant failed to respond to the requests for admission, making the motions granted. The court also grants Plaintiff's motion to compel Defendant's responses to form interrogatories (set two) and imposes sanctions on Defendant for its failure to respond.

The court orders Defendant to pay Plaintiff's counsel attorney fees in the sum of $1,245 for the first motion and $455 for the second motion. The court also grants Plaintiff's request for sanctions and orders Defendant to provide Code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories within 10 days of the order.

The court finds that the motions are granted due to Defendant's failure to respond to the discovery requests and that sanctions are warranted. The court also notes that the motion to compel responses to form interrogatories duplicates in part Plaintiff's prior discovery motion, but reduces the award to $455 due to the duplication.
