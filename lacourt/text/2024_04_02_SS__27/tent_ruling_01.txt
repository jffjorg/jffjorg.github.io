MICHAEL CRAWFORD
Motion:                                MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
Moving Counsel:               Dublas O. Paniagua 
Responding Party:             Unopposed
Notice:                                  Sufficient
  
Ruling:                                 MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL IS
GRANTED
 
 Background
 
Plaintiff Vanessa Ojeda is currently
represented by Counsel Dublas O. Paniagua (“Paniagua”). Paniagua moves to be
relieved as counsel, citing an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship and/or communication, which rendered it unreasonably difficult, if
not impossible, for counsel to continue representing Plaintiff. No opposition
has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
¿ 
The Court has discretion to allow an attorney
to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no
prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.
(See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v.
Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.)
 
A motion to be relieved as counsel must be
made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052
(Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362,
subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the client and on
all parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362,
subd. (d).)
 
Analysis and Conclusion
 
Paniagua has filed and served Judicial Council
Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order) in order to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff on the
grounds that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.
The Court finds this to be proper grounds for withdrawal. A breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship is grounds for allowing the attorney to withdraw.
(Estate of Falco (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.) The Court notes that
the next hearing is an FSC set for 4/30/24, which should be sufficient time for
Plaintiff to retain new counsel. The Court further notes that Plaintiff is
represented by independent counsel, David Bournazian, concerning certain
aspects of the case. If Plaintiff or new counsel needs additional time to
prepare for trial, sufficient time exists for Plaintiff to take action to seek
a continuance of the trial. Thus, the present motion to be relieved as counsel
is GRANTED, effective upon service on Plaintiff of the order relieving Paniagua.
