Background
On November 6, 2020,
Plaintiff filed the current auto accident case against Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority. On January 5, 2023, Defendant served
Special Interrogatories, Set One (“SROGs”), Request for Production, Set One (“RFPs”),
and Form Interrogatories, Set One (“FROGs”) on Plaintiff. Defendant gave
Plaintiff several extensions to provide the discovery responses, with April 3,
2023, as the final deadline. As of May 16, 2023, Plaintiff had failed to
provide the requested discovery responses, leading to the filing of the present
motions. Plaintiff did not submit an opposition.
Legal
Standard 
A plaintiff may make a demand for production
of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10
days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom
the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020,
subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for production
of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply with the
formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party may
propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the subject
matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
The party whom the request is propounded upon
is required to respond within 30 days after service of a demand, but the
parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and confirm any such
agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a) - (b); Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).)¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
If a party fails to timely respond to a
request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request is
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the discovery requests may move for an order
compelling responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to
compel further discovery responses, a motion to compel initial discovery
responses does not have any meet and confer requirements.¿ 
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030,
subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose a
monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process to
pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes failing to
respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿¿A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions.
(Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020)
56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿ 
Analysis 
 
It
is undisputed that Plaintiff did not serve timely initial discovery responses
despite several extensions. Further, Plaintiff did not submit any opposition or
any documentation showing that the discovery responses at issue were provided
prior to the hearing date. Consequently, Defendant's motions
to compel are GRANTED, and Plaintiff is ORDERED to submit verified discovery
responses to the SROGs, FROGs and RFPs without objections within 30 days from
today. 
 
Sanctions 
 
Plaintiff requests sanctions in the amount of
$1,800.00 for each motion. Given the simplicity of the motions and the absence
of an opposition, the Court exercises discretion and reduces the sanction
amount to $2,000 for all three motions.  Plaintiff
and his counsel are ORDERED, jointly and severally, to pay sanctions of $2000
to Defendant within 20 days of today’s date.
