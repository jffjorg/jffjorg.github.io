Legal Standard
¿¿¿¿¿ 
Although continuances of trials are
disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own
merits.  (CRC Rule 3.1332(c).)  The Court may grant a continuance only on an
affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance.  (CRC Rule 3.1332(c).) The Court may look to
the following factors in determining whether a trial continuance is warranted:
(1) proximity of the trial date; (2) whether there was any previous continuance
of trial due to any party; (3) the length of the continuance requested; (4) the
availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the
motion; (5) the prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of
the continuance; and (6) whether trial counsel is engaged in another trial.  (See generally CRC Rule
3.1332(d)(1)-(11).)  Additional factors for the Court to consider include: a party’s
excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material
evidence despite diligent efforts; whether all parties have stipulated to a
continuance; and any other fact or circumstance relevant to the fair
determination of the motion or application.  (CRC Rule 3.1332(c), (d).)
 
Factual Background and Analysis
 
On November 20, 2020, Plaintiff filed the
present automobile accident case. Defendant Jose Gabriel Martinez filed an
answer on January 8, 2021. The Court set the initial trial date for May 20,
2022, which was continued multiple times: from May 20, 2022, to January 4,
2023, to April 19, 2023, to December 4, 2023, and to the current trial date of April
11, 2024.
 
On September 21, 2023, when the Court
continued the trial date to the current date of April 11, 2024, the court
closed all discovery, excluding limited discovery specifically related to
orthopedics and neuropsychological independent medical examinations (IME). On
March 5, 2024, Defendant Jose Gabriel Martinez filed a motion to continue the
trial for an additional four months citing various reasons including numerous
pending motions from both parties that had not yet been addressed, the
unavailability of experts on the scheduled trial date, and the need for
additional time to depose the 25 experts designated in the case. Plaintiff
consented to a short continuance but opposed the reopening of any discovery.
 
Considering the age of the case, the numerous
previous continuances, and the approximately 6 months the parties had as a
result of the last continuance to conduct limited discovery, the Court will grant
only a short continuance.  Further, given
the volume of expert depositions, the opposing party's agreement to a brief
continuance, and the unavailability of experts on the date of the trial, the
court will grant a 30-day continuance. Expert discovery only will be tied to
the new trial date. NO FURTHER CONTINUANCES WILL BE GRANTED.
 
The new Trial
Date is set for May __, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. The Final Status
Conference is continued to May__, 2024, at 10:00
a.m. With the exception of expert discovery, all other case-related deadlines
will not follow the new trial date.
