And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, denied the motion to compel further responses to requests for production, set two, and for sanctions. The motion was filed by Postmates, LLC, the Defendant, and was served electronically on March 8, 2024, which is outside the 16-day notice period required by the California Code of Civil Procedure. The Judge also found that the motion is moot because the discovery responses at issue were served on March 8, 2024, as agreed by the Parties. The Judge noted that the Parties had agreed to provide supplemental responses by March 8, 2024, and that Plaintiff did indeed provide the responses by that date. As a result, the motion is denied, and sanctions are also denied.
