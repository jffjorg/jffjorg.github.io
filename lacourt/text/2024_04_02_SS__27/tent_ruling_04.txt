Background
 
On March 2, 2022, Plaintiff filed the present
auto accident case. On January 9, 2024, Postmates served Requests for
Production of Documents, Set Two, Nos. 36-55 on Plaintiff. On February 13,
2024, Plaintiff served discovery responses. On February 22, 2024, Defendant
sent Plaintiff a detailed meet and confer letter outlining deficiencies in
Plaintiff's responses. Plaintiff requested an extension to respond by March 6,
2024, which Defendant granted. When Plaintiff requested a further one-week
extension, Defendant refused and filed the present motion on March 8, 2024.
Defendant filed an opposition stating that the motion is moot because the
discovery responses at issue have been served on March 8, 2024, pursuant to the
Parties' agreement.
 
Legal Standard
 
Motions
to compel further responses must always be accompanied by a meet-and
confer-declaration (per Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040) demonstrating a
“reasonable and good faith attempt an informal resolution of each issue
presented by the motion.”  (Id., §§ 2030.300(b), 2031.310(b)(2),
2033.290(b).)  They must also be accompanied by a separate statement
containing the requests and the responses, verbatim, as well as reasons why a
further response is warranted.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a).) 
The separate statement must also be complete in itself; no extrinsic materials
may be incorporated by reference.  (Id., rule 3.1345(c).)
 
A
motion to compel further production must set forth specific facts showing good
cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand. (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310(b)(1).) It is not necessary for the motion to show that the
material sought will be admissible in evidence. “Good cause” may be found to
justify discovery where specific facts show that the discovery is necessary for
effective trial preparation or to prevent surprise at trial. (See Associated
Brewers Dist. Co. v. Superior Court (1967) 65 Cal.2d 583, 586-588; see also
CCP §§ 2017.010, 2019.030(a)(1) (Information is discoverable if it is itself
admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence and it is not unreasonably cumulative or
duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient,
less burdensome, or less expensive.); Lipton v. Superior Court (1996) 48
Cal.App.4th 1599, 1611-1612 (noting a party may obtain discovery regarding any
matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the
pending action, if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or
appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence).)
 
Demand
for Inspection
 
A
motion to compel further responses to a demand for inspection or production of
documents (“RFP”) may be brought based on: (1) incomplete statements of
compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or incomplete claims of inability to
comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310(c).)
 
A
motion to compel a further response to a request for production must be noticed
within 45 days of the service of the response, or any supplemental response, or
on or before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the
responding party have agreed in writing.  Otherwise, the propounding party
waives any right to compel further response to the inspection demand. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(c); see also Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1409; Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior Court (1983) 147
Cal.App.3d 681, 685.)  The motion must also be accompanied by a
declaration stating facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of any issue presented by it. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§
2016.040, 2031.310(b)(2).) Finally, a motion to compel further responses to
inspection demands must be accompanied by a separate document that sets forth
each item to which further response is requested and the factual and legal
reasons for compelling it. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a).)
¿
Notice Period
 
CCP § 1005(b) provides “all moving and
supporting papers shall be served and filed at least 16 court days before the
hearing. … if the notice is served by facsimile transmission, express mail, or
another method of delivery providing for overnight delivery, the required
16-day period of notice before the hearing shall be increased by two calendar
days.”
  
CCP § 1010.6(a)(3)(B) Provides “Any period of
notice, or any right or duty to do any act or make any response within any
period or on a date certain after the service of the document, which time
period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of court, shall be extended
after service by electronic means by two court days.”
  
Cole v. Superior Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 87 is on point. In Cole,
the appellate court faced the same issue in relation to a summary judgment
motion and, since CCP Section 437c does not expressly state any extension of
the notice period for electronic service, it looked to CCP Section 1010.6,
which addresses service by electronic transmission, to determine if any
extension applies to such service. And, in fact, Section 1010.6(a)(3)(B)
provides for a two-day notice extension for electronic service. Here, too,
Section 1005(b) does not expressly state an extended notice period, so we look
to Section 1010.6. Accordingly, Plaintiff needed to serve the motion 18 court
days before the hearing.
 
Analysis and Conclusion
 
On February 13, 2024, Plaintiff served the
discovery responses at issue. On March 8, Defendant filed the present motion
within the 45-day deadline pursuant to CCP § 2031.310. However, if served
electronically, the motion must be served and filed 18 court days prior to the
hearing. (CCP § 1005(b), CCP § 1010.6(a)(3)(B), Cole v. Superior Court
(2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 87.) The present motion was served electronically on
March 8, 2024, for a hearing on April 2, 2024, which is only 16 court days
before the hearing, rendering the motion untimely. Furthermore, because
Plaintiff served the further discovery responses at issue, the motion is also
moot. Thus, the present motion is DENIED.
 
Sanctions are denied because, as set forth
above, the motion is denied, and, further, the Parties agreed that the
supplemental responses would be provided on March 8, 2024 (Defendant’s Ex. G),
and Plaintiff indeed provided the responses by that date. (Plaintiff’s Ex. 1.)
