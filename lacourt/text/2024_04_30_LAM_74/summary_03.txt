And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's further responses to special interrogatories in part. The defendant must provide further responses to special interrogatories 88, 89, 95, 96, 97, 98, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, and 120 within 30 days. The court also denies the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's further response to special interrogatory 113.

The court's ruling is based on the plaintiff's allegations that the defendant breached the parties' partnership agreement and withheld sale proceeds. The court finds that the defendant's right to privacy in financial affairs is outweighed by the plaintiff's need to determine damages and verify the amount of sale proceeds the defendant allegedly withheld. The court also notes that the defendant's objections to the discovery requests are without merit.
