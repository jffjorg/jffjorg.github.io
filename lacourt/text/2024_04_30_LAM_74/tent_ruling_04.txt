 Case Number:  22STCV35846    Hearing Date:   April 30, 2024    Dept:  74 Queen Williams v. Corey Flournoy
Williams
Defendant Corey Flournoy William’s Motion to Compel
Plaintiff Queen William’s Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) and
Request for Sanctions
 
BACKGROUND 
            This action arises from a property
dispute.
            On November 10, 2022, Plaintiff
Queen Williams (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against Defendant Corey Flournoy
Williams (Defendant). In the complaint, Plaintiff alleges the following causes
of action: (1) financial elder abuse, (2) conversion, (3) unjust enrichment,
(4) cancellation of instrument, (5) cancellation of instrument, (6) quiet
title, (7) quiet title, (8) violation of Tom Bane Civil Rights Act, (9)
violation of Civil Code Section 789.3, and (10) wrongful eviction.
            On October 27, 2023, Defendant
served Plaintiff with special interrogatories (set one) by mail and email.
(Chen Decl., ¶ 4.) Plaintiff’s daughter acknowledged receipt of the discovery
by email but told Defendant’s counsel that the email address did not belong to
Plaintiff. (Chen Decl., ¶ 6.) Plaintiff’s daughter later asked Defendant’s
counsel to send all documents to her via the same email address. (Chen Decl., ¶
12.)
            On December 22, 2023, Defendant’s
counsel called Plaintiff about her failure to respond to the special
interrogatories. Plaintiff confirmed her mailing address but claimed she had
not received the special interrogatories. (Chen Decl., ¶ 9.) 
            On January 19, 2024, Defendant had
the special interrogatories personally delivered to Plaintiff’s address. (Chen
Decl., ¶ 10; Ex. F.) 
            On January 31, 2024, Defendant’s
counsel sent a letter to Plaintiff regarding her failure to respond to the special
interrogatories. (Chen Decl., ¶ 11.) 
            To date, Plaintiff has not provided
responses to the special interrogatories.
            On February 20, 2024, Defendant
filed this motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to the special
interrogatories.
LEGAL STANDARD
¿¿            If
a party to whom interrogatories or an inspection demand were directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses without objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b).) Moreover, failure to timely serve responses waives
objections to the requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300,
subd. (a).) Failure to verify a response is equivalent to no response at all. (Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)  
DISCUSSION  
            The
court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to the special
interrogatories. Defendant has persuaded the court that Plaintiff has received
the discovery at issue. On October 27, 2023, Defendant mailed the special interrogatories
to Plaintiff’s confirmed mailing address. (Chen Decl., ¶¶ 4, 9.) That same day,
Defendant emailed the special interrogatories to Plaintiff’s daughter, who has
expressed that all documents should be emailed to her. (Chen Decl., ¶¶ 4, 6,
12.) In addition, Defendant had the special interrogatories personally
delivered to Plaintiff’s confirmed address on January 19, 2024. (Chen Decl., ¶¶
9, 10.) Moreover, Plaintiff has provided no evidence to the contrary in a
timely opposition. Given Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond, the court
grants Defendant’s motion.
            As
the prevailing party, Defendant is entitled to sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (c).) Moreover, Plaintiff has not demonstrated she acted with
substantial justification in a timely opposition. The court finds Defendant’s
counsel’s proposed hourly rate reasonable, and he has substantiated his request
for attorney fees with a breakdown of work performed. (Chen Decl., ¶ 14.) However,
this motion largely duplicates Defendant’s other discovery motions. The court
will adjust the award accordingly: $761.65 ($350/hr x 2 hours + $61.65).
CONCLUSION 
The court grants
Defendant’s motion to compel responses to special interrogatories (set one) and
request for sanctions. Plaintiff shall serve responsive documents and
Code-compliant responses, without objections, within 10 days of this order. The
court grants Defendant’s request for sanctions. Plaintiff shall pay Defendant’s
counsel attorney fees in the sum of $761.65 within 30 days of this order.
Defendant shall
give notice.
