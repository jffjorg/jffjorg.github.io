and requests for sanctions on July 23 and July 24, 2024.  Plaintiffs filed replies on July 29 and July
30, 2024.  The Court continued the
hearings to September 23, 2024. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for June 11, 2025. 
PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS 
A.      Informal Discovery Conference 
The
Eighth Amended Standing Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts
Effective October 10, 2022 (filed September 20, 2022), ¶ 9E, provides: “PI Hub
Courts will not hear Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Discovery
until the parties have engaged in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC).  PI Hub Courts may deny or continue a Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Discovery if parties fail to schedule and
complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on a Motion to Compel Further Responses
to Discovery.” 
The
parties participated in IDCs on May 16, 2024 and July 23, 2024. 
B.       Timeliness 
A
notice of motion to compel further responses must be given within 45 days of
the service of the verified responses, or any supplemental verified responses,
or on or before any later date to which the parties have agreed in writing. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c) [demand for inspection]; Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.300, subd. (c) [interrogatories].) 
Failure to file a motion by this deadline constitutes a waiver of any
right to compel further responses. 
Plaintiffs
assert that Caltrans agreed to extend the time to file a motion to compel until
60 days after an IDC.  The first IDC took
place on May 16, 2024.  Plaintiffs filed
the motions on June 5, 2024, before the deadline. 
C.   Meet and confer 
A
motion to compel further responses to a demand for inspection or interrogatories
must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2016.040.  (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd (b)(2) [demand for inspection]; Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.300, subd. (b)(1) [interrogatories].) 
“A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts
showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each
issue presented by the motion.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)  
Plaintiffs
have provided meet and confer declarations. 
D.      Separate statement 
With
exceptions that do not apply here, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345,
requires that any motion involving the content of discovery contain a separate
statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of
factual and legal reasons for why an order compelling further responses is
warranted.  
Plaintiffs
filed separate statements. 
APPLICABLE LAW 
A.   Demand for inspection 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2031.310 provides in part: 
“(a) On receipt of a response to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an
order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems
that any of the following apply: 
“(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete. 
“(2) A representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. 
“(3) An objection in the response is without merit or
too general. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
each of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040.
“(3) In lieu of a separate statement required under
the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a
concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute. 
“(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45
days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the demanding party
and the responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any
right to compel a further response to the demand. 
* * *
  “(h) Except as provided in subdivision (j), the court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1031.310,
subds. (a), (b), (c), (h).) 
B.   Interrogatories 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 provides in
part: 
“(a) On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the
propounding party deems that any of the following apply: 
“(1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is
evasive or incomplete. 
“(2) An exercise of the option to produce documents
under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those
documents is inadequate. 
“(3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit
or too general. 
“(b) (1) A motion under subdivision (a) shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(2) In lieu of a separate statement required under
the California Rules of Court, the court may allow the moving party to submit a
concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute. 
“(c) Unless notice of this motion is given within 45
days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party
waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories. 
“(d) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further
response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subds. (a), (b), (c), (d).)  
DISCUSSION 
A.   Plaintiffs’ requests for judicial notice 
The
Court grants Plaintiffs’ requests for judicial notice.  (Evid. Code, §§ 452, subd. (d), 453.) 
B.  
Plaintiffs’
motion to compel Caltrans’ further responses to special interrogatories, set
one 
Served:                            March
1, 2023 and June 14, 2023 Responses:                       May
23, 2023Further responses:  
         January 16, 2024In
its amended response to special interrogatory 1, Caltrans stated: “At the
intersection of the 210 eastbound freeway onramp and Foothill Boulevard,
[Caltrans] owns the 210 freeway within its right of way, 210 freeway structure
within its right of way and only the area of Foothill Boulevard directly below
the 210 freeway structure within its right of way.”  Caltrans’ amended responses to other special
interrogatories include similar language about its “right of way.”
According to Caltrans, it cannot provide more precise
responses because Plaintiffs’ special interrogatories included imprecise
language.  But any imprecision in the
special interrogatories does not explain why Caltrans cannot state what it
means by “within its right of way.” 
Caltrans also asserts that it “produced in Exhibit 11
records that reflect Caltrans’s right of way . . . .”  (Opposition pp. 8-9.)  Caltrans cited these records in its amended
responses as “Bates CT0020764-0020796.” 
The amended responses also cited “Exhibit 15 [Bates CT0020865-875]” and
“Exhibit 16 [Bates CT0020876-895],” which appear to be maintenance agreements
between Caltrans and the City of La Canada. 
(See Opposition to Separate Statement pp. 89-90.) 
The Court
cannot locate these records in the parties’ submissions and therefore cannot
determine whether they provide sufficient information about Caltrans' "right of way" to satisfy Caltrans’
discovery obligation.  The Court
continues the hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion to compel further responses to
special interrogatory numbers 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 40 and orders Caltrans to
submit a supplemental declaration providing copies of the records cited in its
amended special interrogatory responses which, according to Caltrans, reflect
“Caltrans’ right[s] of way.”

The
Court denies the motion. 
Caltrans
requests $2,420.00 in sanctions based on 11 hours of attorney time at a rate of
$220.00 per hour.  Counsel spent eight
hours preparing Caltrans’ opposition and anticipated spending two hours to
review Plaintiffs’ reply and prepare for the hearing and one hour to appear at
the hearing. 
The
Court grants $880.00 in sanctions based on four hours of attorney time.
