PARTY’S REQUESTS 
Rosendin
asks the Court to order David C. Lee, MD (“Dr. Lee”) to comply with a
deposition subpoena and impose sanctions on Dr. Lee. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.480 provides in part: 
“(a) If a deponent fails to answer any question or to
produce any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing
under the deponent’s control that is specified in the deposition notice or a
deposition subpoena, the party seeking discovery may move the court for an
order compelling that answer or production. 
“(b) This motion shall be made no later than 60 days
after the completion of the record of the deposition, and shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(c) Notice of this motion shall be given to all
parties and to the deponent either orally at the examination, or by subsequent
service in writing. If the notice of the motion is given orally, the deposition
officer shall direct the deponent to attend a session of the court at the time
specified in the notice. 
* * *
  “(h) Not less than five days prior to the hearing on
this motion, the moving party shall lodge with the court a certified copy of
any parts of the stenographic transcript of the deposition that are relevant to
the motion. If a deposition is recorded by audio or video technology, the
moving party is required to lodge a certified copy of a transcript of any parts
of the deposition that are relevant to the motion. 
“(i) If the court determines that the answer or
production sought is subject to discovery, it shall order that the answer be
given or the production be made on the resumption of the deposition. 
“(j) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel an answer or
production, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480,
subds. (a), (b), (c), (h), (i), (j).) 
DISCUSSION 
Rosendin
asks the Court to compel Dr. Lee’s attendance at a deposition because Dr. Lee failed
to appear at a properly noticed deposition on June 17, 2024. Dr. Lee “was the
orthopedic surgeon who performed surgery on Plaintiff’s right ankle a few days
following the Subject Incident.”  (Motion
p. 3.)  According to Rosendin, Dr. Lee
refused to appear because Rosendin declined to pay Dr. Lee for his preparation
time (in addition to the time spent at the deposition).
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2034.430, subdivision (b), provides: 
“(b) A party desiring to depose an expert witness
described in subdivision (a) shall pay the expert’s reasonable and customary
hourly or daily fee for any time spent at the deposition from the time noticed
in the deposition subpoena, or from the time of the arrival of the expert
witness should that time be later than the time noticed in the deposition
subpoena, until the time the expert witness is dismissed from the deposition,
regardless of whether the expert is actually deposed by any party attending the
deposition.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.430,
subd. (b); see Code Civ. Proc., § 2034.430, subd. (a)(2).) 
The
statute, on its face, does not entitle an expert witness to compensation for
time spent preparing for a deposition. 
Dr. Lee has not filed an opposition to Rosendin’s motion explaining why
he believes Rosendin should compensate him for this time. 
The
Court grants the motion and orders Dr. Lee to appear at a deposition by October
22, 2024. Rosendin asks the Court to
impose monetary sanctions against Dr. Lee. 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480,
subdivision (j), authorizes the Court to impose monetary sanctions “against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel an answer or production, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
Dr. Lee did not make or oppose a motion to compel attendance at a
deposition.  Therefore, Code of Civil
Procedure section 2025.480, subdivision (j), does not authorize a sanctions
award. 
Other
statutes addressing misuse of the discovery process do not, by themselves,
authorize a sanctions award for Rosendin’s motion.  In City of Los Angeles v.
Pricewaterhousecoopers, LLP (Aug. 23, 2024) __ Cal.5th __ [2024 WL 3894042,
2024 DJDAR 8056, slip opn. pp. 1-42] (PwC), the Supreme Court held: “It
is already well-established that a court may not rely on [Code of Civil
Procedure] section 2023.030 to override the limitations prescribed by any other
applicable sanctions provision in the Act. A court may invoke its independent
authority to impose sanctions under sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 only when
confronted with an unusual form of discovery abuse, or a pattern of abuse, not
already addressed by a relevant sanctions provision. And where it invokes that
authority, it is constrained by the long-settled rules generally governing the
imposition of discovery sanctions under the Act.”  (PwC, supra, __ Cal.5th __
[2024 WL 3894042 at *18, 2024 DJDAR at p. 8066, slip opn. at p. 40].) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.480, subdivision (j), limits the Court’s
authority to impose sanctions when (as here) a non-moving third-party
deponent does not oppose a successful motion to compel attendance at a
deposition.  Because the statute addresses
the issue, the Court may not invoke its independent authority to impose
sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030.  (See PwC, supra, __ Cal.5th __
[2024 WL 3894042 at *18, 2024 DJDAR at p. 8066, slip opn. at p. 40].) 
 The Court denies Rosendin’s
sanctions request. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS
Rosendin
Electric, Inc.’s motion to compel
the deposition of David C. Lee,
M.D., and
for sanctions.  The Court orders David C. Lee, M.D. to appear for a deposition by
October 22, 2024.  Rosendin Electric,
Inc. is to make all necessary arrangements to take David C. Lee, M.D.’s
deposition by this deadline. 
The Court
DENIES Rosendin Electric, Inc.’s request for sanctions. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
