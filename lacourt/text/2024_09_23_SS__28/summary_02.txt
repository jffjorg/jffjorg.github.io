And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules on Rosendin Electric, Inc.'s motion to compel the deposition of David C. Lee, M.D. Dr. Lee failed to appear at a previously noticed deposition, citing Rosendin's refusal to pay for his preparation time. The judge finds that Dr. Lee has not provided a valid reason for not appearing at the deposition and orders him to appear at a deposition by October 22, 2024. The judge also denies Rosendin's request for sanctions, as the relevant statutes do not provide for sanctions in this situation.
