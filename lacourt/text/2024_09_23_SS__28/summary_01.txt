And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Union Rescue Mission's motion to dismiss the case without prejudice. The plaintiff, Lanell Williams-Yulee, did not serve the summons and complaint on Union Rescue Mission within three years of filing the complaint, which is a mandatory requirement under California Code of Civil Procedure section 583.250. The plaintiff's failure to serve the summons and complaint within the statutory deadline is a fatal error that cannot be cured by exercising the court's discretion under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). The judge finds that there is no excusable neglect or mistake that would warrant setting aside the mandatory dismissal requirement. The judge therefore grants the motion to dismiss and dismisses Union Rescue Mission without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to refile the action against Union Rescue Mission if desired.
