And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers and rules as follows. The District's demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint is sustained with 30 days leave to amend. The District's motion to strike references to Government Code section 815.6, Education Code section 44807, and California Code of Regulations, title 5, sections 5531 and 5552 in the plaintiff's first amended complaint is granted with 30 days leave to amend. The judge finds that the plaintiff's claim for negligent supervision of students does not state a claim for relief under Government Code section 815.2 and that the District's regulations do not impose a mandatory duty to supervise students. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's opposition to the motion to strike does not address the question whether the regulations impose a mandatory duty for purposes of Government Code section 815.6.
