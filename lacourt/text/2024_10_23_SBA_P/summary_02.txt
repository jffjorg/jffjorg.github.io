And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer filed by the defendant, Enterprise Rent-a-Car Company of Sacramento, LLC, to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Merclyn Georgia Brown. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant is liable for the injuries she sustained in a motor vehicle collision caused by the negligence of Artem Khakhaev, who was driving a Freightliner commercial vehicle owned by the defendant. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's complaint is unclear and does not state a cause of action, and that it is not liable for the negligent acts of its customers.

The court has ruled that the defendant's demurrer is overruled, and that the plaintiff's allegations of negligence are sufficient to survive a demurrer. The court has also taken judicial notice of the Statement of Information filed with the Secretary of State, which indicates that the defendant is in the business of renting and/or leasing vehicles.

The court has further ruled that the Graves Amendment, which protects car rental businesses from liability for the independent negligent acts of their customers, does not apply in this case. The plaintiff has alleged that the defendant was negligent in allowing an incompetent driver to operate its vehicle, and that this negligence caused the plaintiff's injuries. Therefore, the plaintiff's claims against the defendant are not barred by the Graves Amendment.

The court has also ruled that the defendant's demurrer is premature, and that the parties must allow discovery to resolve factual disputes before the merits of the case can be determined. The court has therefore overruled the defendant's demurrer in its entirety.
