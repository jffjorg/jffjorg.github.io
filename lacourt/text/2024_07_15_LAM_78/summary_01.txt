And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively denied plaintiff Purushottam Patel's motion to compel the deposition and production of documents from ADP, Inc. The court found that the motion was not timely filed, as plaintiff's counsel had been requested to take the motion off-calendar but failed to do so. The court also noted that there are three other motions to compel set for hearing on July 16, 18, and 22, 2024, and directed the plaintiff to review the court's prior orders and take these motions off-calendar unless they fall within one of the specified exceptions. The court also ordered the moving party to give notice of the tentative ruling.
