And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying defendant CAA's motion for summary judgment. CAA argued that it was a licensed general contractor hired by Wiener, who was acting on behalf of GRCA2, and that the settlement agreement between GRCA2 and Plaintiff released all claims, including those against CAA. The judge found that CAA had not met its burden of showing that the settlement agreement released claims against CAA, and that there were triable issues of material fact regarding the intent of the release. The judge also noted that CAA had not pleaded waiver as an affirmative defense in its answer to the complaint and that the defense was being raised for the first time on motion for summary judgment. The judge concluded that CAA's motion was denied.
