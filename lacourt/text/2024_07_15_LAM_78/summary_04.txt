And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer to complaint and a motion to quash service of summons filed by Hanesbrands Inc. dba www.maidenform.com (the "defendant") against Miltita Casillas (the "plaintiff"). The plaintiff alleges that the defendant's website collects IP addresses of visitors in violation of the California Invasion of Privacy Act. The defendant argues that it is a non-California resident and has not purposefully availed itself of the forum.

The court finds that the defendant's demurrer to the complaint is moot because the plaintiff filed a first amended complaint that supersedes the original complaint. The court also grants the defendant's motion to quash service of summons because the plaintiff has not demonstrated that the defendant purposefully availed itself of the forum or has sufficient contacts with California to justify personal jurisdiction.

The court explains that personal jurisdiction is proper if the defendant has purposefully directed its activities toward California, the controversy is related to or arises out of the defendant's contacts with the forum, and the exercise of jurisdiction would comport with "fair play and substantial justice." The court finds that the defendant has purposefully availed itself of the forum because it operates retail stores in California, is registered to do business in California, and has a website that is available to Californians. However, the court concludes that the plaintiff has not demonstrated a sufficient connection between the defendant's activities in California and the plaintiff's claims.

The court also declines to grant the plaintiff's request for jurisdictional discovery, finding that the plaintiff has not demonstrated how discovery would change the outcome of the analysis.
