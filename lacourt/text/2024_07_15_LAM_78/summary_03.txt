And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies without prejudice the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Defendant Kreation Juicery Inc.'s attorney, Arash Sadat, Esq. of Mills Sadat Dowlat LLP. The Court finds that the attorney cannot withdraw from representation without complying with the procedures set forth in California Rule of Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3.700 and without giving due notice to the client and allowing time for the client to secure new counsel. The Court also finds that permitting the attorney to withdraw would prejudice the client's interests, particularly given the approaching trial date of August 19, 2024. The Court orders Counsel to give notice and encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement. If the parties cannot reach an agreement, they should appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
