 Case Number:  BC583661    Hearing Date:   November 8, 2023    Dept:  55 The hearing on Plaintiff's motion to vacate dismissal and enter judgment is continued to 12/1/23 at 8:30
a.m. in Department 55.The Court finds that there was no notice of the continuance
from 11/1/23 as required by the 10/25/23 order. Due-process principles require notice and an opportunity to be heard as to those having an interest in a matter.   Monarch Healthcare v. Sup. Ct.  (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1282, 1286  It also appears that the law firm representing Plaintiff changed its address between the time the Court dismissed the case in 2015 and the filing of this motion to set aside the dismissal, but never updated its address with the Court. Plaintiff needs to change its address with the Court to ensure it receives notices from the Court.
