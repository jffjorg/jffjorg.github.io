The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case BC583661. The hearing on the Plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal and enter judgment has been continued to December 1, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 55. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff was not given proper notice of the continuance from November 1, 2023, as required by the October 25, 2023, order. This is a violation of due-process principles, which require notice and an opportunity to be heard for those with an interest in the matter. Additionally, the Judge notes that the law firm representing the Plaintiff changed its address between 2015 and the filing of the motion, but failed to update the Court with the new address. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to update its address with the Court to ensure it receives notices from the Court.
