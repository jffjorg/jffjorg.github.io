  Case Number:  22STCV10623    Hearing Date:   February 7, 2024    Dept:  15 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE MOTION TO COMPEL
            On
January 23, 2024, the court set an expedited briefing schedule for Defendant American
Biltrite Inc. to file a motion to compel testing of a tissue sample by January
25, 2024, and Plaintiffs Judy Ann Golby and Raymond Golby to file an opposition
by January 29, 2024, with a hearing on January 31, 2024.  Plaintiffs complained that Defendant served
the motion at 8:17 pm instead of by 5:00 pm, and thereby did not give
Plaintiffs enough time to file an opposition. 
The court continued the hearing to February 7, 2024, giving Plaintiffs
five more days for their opposition.  Plaintiffs
filed an opposition on February 5, 2024.
            On
May 10, 2023, Defendant requested Judy Ann Golby’s pathology materials.  (Jenkins Decl., ¶ 2.)  It appears that after that date, nothing
happened for months.  On October 25 and
17, 2023, Defendant stated it wanted to test the pathology.  (Jenkins Decl., Exs. C, E.)  On October 27, 2023, Plaintiffs sent
Defendant a stipulation to obtain the pathology materials from the facility
where they were being held.  (Id.,
Ex. F.)  Between November 7 and 20, 2023,
counsel met and conferred about revising the stipulation to allow certain testing
of the pathology.  (Id., Exs. G,
H, I, J.)  Defendant signed the
stipulation on December 4, 2023.  (Renken
Decl., ¶ 6.)  On December 26, 2023, Defendant
served a subpoena on the facility for the pathology material and served a
notice of intent to conduct destructive testing on January 8, 2024.  (Renken Decl., ¶ 7.)  
            Defendant
contends that Plaintiffs now do not agree that Defendant can conduct the
testing of the pathology, even though the parties signed the stipulation
allowing the testing.  (Motion at p.
3.)  Defendant seeks an order allowing
the testing pursuant to the December 4, 2023 stipulation.
            Plaintiffs
argue that it is too late for any testing because discovery is closed and trial
is on February 20, 2024, and Defendant waited too long.  Plaintiffs argue they will be prejudiced
because if Defendant can perform the testing, then Plaintiffs’ experts will
need to do additional work, and it is too close to trial.
            The parties’
signed stipulation states, “Tissue digestion is allowed only as long as
defendants comply with General Order 28.” 
(Jenkins Decl., Ex. K at p. 2.)  Plaintiffs
do not argue that Defendant failed to comply with the order.  Plaintiffs’ argument is merely that it is too
late for testing.  It is unclear why the
testing did not go forward in January 2024, after Defendant obtained the
pathology material and before the discovery cutoff date.  Instead, the parties have now spent weeks quibbling
over testing that they had previously agreed to.
            Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050, the court can reopen discovery after
considering various matters.  The February
20, 2024 trial date is no obstacle here. 
This is not a preference case, and it is very unlikely this case will be
sent to trial on February 20, 2024 in any event.  There are four other cases set for trial that
date, including one case where the trial date has been continued already
because of lack of trial courts.  In
addition, there are three cases set for trial on February 13, and it is
extremely unlikely they will all be sent out to trial courts.  It is very likely that at least one or two of
the February 13 cases will have their trial date continued to February 20.  The most likely scenario is that on February
20, this case will get in line behind at least two or three other cases waiting
for an available trial court.
            Defendant
has shown a reason to do the testing related to Golby’s alleged exposure to
asbestos.  Plaintiffs cannot contend they
are prejudiced by the testing – they already agreed in the stipulation that
Defendant could do it.  While Defendant
could have acted more expeditiously in getting the testing done, it acted with
enough time to complete it before the original cutoff date if Plaintiffs had
not thrown up objections.
            The
motion is GRANTED.  Defendant may perform
the testing pursuant to the December 4, 2023 stipulation.  The trial is continued to April 22, 2024 at 9
a.m. to allow the testing and expert discovery related to the testing  The final status conference is continued to
April 8, 2024 at 9 a.m.  No other dates
are continued except for the discovery cutoff dates concerning fact and expert discovery
related to the tissue testing.
            The
moving party is to give notice.
