And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel testing of a tissue sample. The defendant had previously signed a stipulation with the plaintiffs allowing the testing, but the plaintiffs argued that the testing is too late and will prejudice their experts. The judge finds that the defendant has shown a reason to perform the testing, which is related to the alleged exposure of one of the plaintiffs to asbestos. The judge also finds that the plaintiffs cannot argue that they are prejudiced by the testing, since they already agreed to the stipulation. The judge orders the defendant to perform the testing pursuant to the stipulation and continues the trial date to April 22, 2024, to allow for the testing and expert discovery related to the testing.
