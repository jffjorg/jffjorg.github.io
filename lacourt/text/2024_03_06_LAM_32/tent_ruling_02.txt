  Case No.:  22STCV29783
  Hearing Date:  March 6, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to appoint guardian
  ad litem 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On September 13, 2022, Plaintiff
Francisca Villalpando filed this action against Defendant Serafin H.
Villalpando and Does 1 through 10. The complaint asserts (1) quiet title, (2)
slander of title, (3) financial elder abuse, (4) deceit, (5) and cancellation
of written instrument. 
            On August 17, 2023, default was
entered for Plaintiff against Defendant Serafin H. Villalpando. A default
prove-up hearing has been set for March 26, 2024. 
            On January 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to appoint her niece and caretaker, Claudia Desales, as guardian
ad litem. Plaintiff’s Application and Order for Guardian Ad Litem was
rejected on January 25, 2024 for failing to include certain necessary
information. The notice of rejection asked Plaintiff to resubmit a revised
form. 
LEGAL STANDARD
“When a minor, a person who lacks legal
capacity to make decisions, or a person for whom a conservator has been
appointed is a party, that person shall appear either by a guardian or
conservator of the estate or by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in
which the action or proceeding is pending, or by a judge thereof, in each case.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 372(a)(1).) 
DISCUSSION
            Initially, the Court notes that
Plaintiff’s motion claims the case is against Oracio Serafin Villalpando and
Gumercindo Villalpando. (See Mtn. 3:3-6.) Neither of these individuals are
named in the complaint, and Plaintiff has not executed any Doe amendments.
Default was entered on August 17, 2023 against the single named Defendant,
Serafin H. Villalpando. 
            As to Plaintiff’s request to appoint
a guardian ad litem, Plaintiff’s initial application was rejected, and Plaintiff
was instructed to refile a proper application. Plaintiff has not filed an
amended application. Plaintiff must file a correct application with the
necessary information in order for the Court to grant her request.
