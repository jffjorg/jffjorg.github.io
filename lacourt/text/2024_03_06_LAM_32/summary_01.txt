The second amended complaint is allowed to be filed within 10 days of the order. The defendants have not opposed the motion, and in fact have indicated that they would stipulate to the filing of the second amended complaint. The judge's decision is based on the court's policy of liberality in permitting amendments at any stage of the proceeding, as long as no prejudice to the opposing party is shown.
