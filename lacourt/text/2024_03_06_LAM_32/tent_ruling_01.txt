     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion for leave to file
  second amended complaint 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On July 20, 2022, Plaintiff CostTree
Holding, LLC filed this action against Defendants eCivis, Inc., GTY Technology
Holdings, Inc., and James Ha. On September 26, 2022, Plaintiff filed the
operative First Amended Complaint, alleging (1) breach of the covenant of good
faith and fair dealing, (2) fraud, (3) negligent misrepresentation, and (4)
civil conspiracy. 
            On January 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint. Defendants
have not filed an opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD
The court may, in furtherance of justice,
and on such terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading. (Code
Civ. Proc, §§ 473, subd. (a), 576.) Courts must apply a policy of liberality in
permitting amendments at any stage of the proceeding, including during trial,
when no prejudice to the opposing party is shown. (Duchrow v. Forrest
(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1377.) In determining the extent of prejudice to
the opposing party, the court must consider various factors, such as whether
the amendment would delay trial or increase the discovery burden. (Demetriades
v. Yelp, Inc. (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 294, 306.)
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff’s motion and attached
declaration satisfy the requirements for seeking leave to amend. (See Cal.
Rules of Ct., Rule 3.1324(b).) Defendants do not oppose the motion and in fact
indicated in correspondence that they would stipulate to the filing of the SAC.
(Bevitz Decl., Ex. 3.)
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion for leave to
amend is GRANTED. Second Amended Complaint shall be filed within 10 days of
this order.
