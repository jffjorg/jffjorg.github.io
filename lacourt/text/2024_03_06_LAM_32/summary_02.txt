And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the court regarding a motion to appoint a guardian ad litem. The case, No. 22STCV29783, was filed by Francisca Villalpando against Serafin H. Villalpando and Does 1-10. The plaintiff has requested the appointment of her niece and caretaker, Claudia Desales, as guardian ad litem. However, the court has rejected the initial application for failing to include necessary information.

The court notes that the complaint does not name Oracio Serafin Villalpando and Gumercindo Villalpando, who are mentioned in the motion, and that default was entered against Serafin H. Villalpando. The court also notes that the plaintiff has not filed an amended application and must resubmit a revised form in order for the court to grant the request.

The court cites California Code of Civil Procedure Section 372(a)(1), which states that when a minor, a person who lacks legal capacity, or a person for whom a conservator has been appointed is a party, that person shall appear by a guardian or conservator of the estate or by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court. The court will not grant the request until a proper application is filed.
