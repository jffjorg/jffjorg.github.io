And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining Defendant's demurrer to Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint without leave to amend. The ruling finds that Plaintiff is collaterally estopped from arguing that his bitcoin was improperly disposed of, as the bankruptcy court had previously found that BlockFi did not violate California law or contract by liquidating the bitcoin. The judge concludes that Plaintiff's claims against Defendant are barred by collateral estoppel, and therefore, the demurrer is sustained.
