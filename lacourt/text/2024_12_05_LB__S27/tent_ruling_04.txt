 Case Number:  23LBCV01514    Hearing Date:   December 5, 2024    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff propounded special
interrogatories, form interrogatories (general), form interrogatories
(employment), RPDs and RFAs on Defendant, Southern California BTS, Inc. on 11/01/23.  To date, despite multiple extensions of time
to respond, Defendant has not served responses to any of the propounded
discovery.  Plaintiff therefore seeks an
order compelling Defendant to respond, without objections, to the outstanding
discovery, deeming the RFAs admitted, and requiring Defendant and Defense
Counsel to pay sanctions.
 
Plaintiff’s motions to compel are
granted.  Defendant is ordered to serve
verified responses to form interrogatories (general), form interrogatories
(employment), special interrogatories and RPDs, without objections, within ten
days.  CCP §§2030.290(a),(b),
2031.300(a),(b).  
 
Plaintiff’s motion to deem RFAs
admitted is granted.  CCP §2033.280(b).
 
Sanctions are mandatory.  §§2030.290(c), 2031.300(c), 2033.280(c).  Plaintiff seeks sanctions in the amounts of $4750/motion.  Counsel bills at the rate of $500/hour.  The Court awards one hour of time to prepare
each of these form discovery motions.  No
opposition was filed and therefore no reply was necessary.  The Court awards one hour to appear at the
hearing on the motions, and only awards the time once.  The Court therefore awards a total of four hours
of attorney time at the requested rate $500/hour, or $2000 in attorneys’ fees.  
 
Sanctions are sought against and imposed
against Defendant and its attorney of record, jointly and severally; they are
ordered to pay sanctions to Plaintiff, by and through his attorney of record,
in the amount of $2000, within twenty days.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.
