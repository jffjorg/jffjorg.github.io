And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel arbitration in a real estate dispute. The plaintiff, Bernald Rock, filed a complaint against several defendants, including Patricia J. Danis, Successor Trustee of the Jean L. Davis Revocable Living Trust, Sati AH, Inc., Castlehead, Inc., Jona Howe, and Vashti Clisby. The complaint alleges breaches of contract, implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, quiet title, and negligence.

The defendants, including Danis, Sati AH, Inc., and Castlehead, Inc., filed a cross-complaint against Orange Coast Title Company and Real Advantage Title Insurance Company, alleging breaches of statutory duties, fraudulent concealment, negligent misrepresentation, negligence, breach of contract, implied indemnity, equitable indemnity, contribution, and declaratory relief.

The Judge denied the motion to compel arbitration, finding that the claims against Orange Coast and Real Advantage are not subject to any arbitration agreement and that there is a risk of inconsistent rulings if the claims running between SATI and Davis are submitted to arbitration but the claims running between SATI and Orange Coast/Real Advantage are heard in court.

The Judge also noted that the parties had settled all claims in the complaint against all defendants, except for the claims in the cross-complaint against Orange Coast and Real Advantage, which remain pending. The parties are reminded that there is an OSC re: Why the Court should not Sustain the entire Cross-Complaint without Leave to Amend or to Impose Monetary Sanctions on calendar concurrently with the hearing on the above motion.
