And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's petition for relief from the failure to timely file a claim. The plaintiff, C.J., filed a complaint against the Long Beach Unified School District (LBUSD) on June 13, 2024, alleging negligence and violation of Government Code sections 815.2(a) and 820(a) arising from a fall in the school district's hallway on January 19, 2023. The plaintiff also filed an application for leave to present a late claim on September 19, 2023, which was responded to by the school district on September 29, 2023. The claim was deemed denied by operation of law on November 3, 2023. The plaintiff had six months from the date of denial to petition the court for relief, but did not file the petition until August 7, 2024, several months late. The judge finds that the petition was improperly filed as a "motion" rather than a "petition" and was not timely filed. The judge orders the plaintiff to give notice and warns that the motion may be placed off calendar if no appearances are made at the hearing.
