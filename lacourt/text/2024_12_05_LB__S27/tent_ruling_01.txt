  Case Number:  22LBCV00534    Hearing Date:   December 5, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.    
Motion
for Attorneys’ Fees
a.    
Opposition

Any opposition to the motion was due on or before 11/20/24.  CCP §1005(b). 
Defendant has not filed timely opposition to the motion, and the Court
will not consider late-filed opposition. 

 
b.    
Analysis
Plaintiff seeks to recover $36,754 in attorneys’ fees, $18,377 as a
lodestar enhancement, and $9049.48 in costs and expenses.  
 
The Court has reviewed the Declaration of Roger Kirnos in support of the
motion and finds the declaration makes a prima facie showing that the fees, to
date, have been both actually and reasonably incurred.  The Court notes, however, that no opposition
papers were filed, and therefore the Court does not award the $2700 sought to
review the opposition and prepare a reply.   

 
The Court therefore finds that $34,043 in attorneys’ fees was reasonably
and necessarily incurred.
 
c.    
Multiplier
The attorney rates charged in this case range from $295 to $645/hour,
with the majority of the fees charged in the $500/hour range.  Pursuant to Ketchem v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1139, the Court should only award a multiplier based on exceptional
representation if it finds the quality of representation far exceeds the
quality of representation that would have been provided by an attorney of
comparable skill and experience billing at the hourly rate used in the lodestar
calculation.  The Court noted that,
otherwise, the fee award would result in unfair double counting and would be
unreasonable.  
 
The Court finds the hourly rates charged are sufficient to compensate
Counsel for the time spent pursuing the case, and therefore no multiplier is
awarded.  
 
d.    
Costs
and Expenses
The Court notes that the motion
also seeks recovery of costs.  Plaintiff
filed a memorandum of costs on 8/06/24. 
Any award of costs will be made in connection with the memorandum, not
this motion.  
 
e.    
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s motion is granted and Plaintiff is awarded $34,043 in
fees.

The parties are reminded that there
