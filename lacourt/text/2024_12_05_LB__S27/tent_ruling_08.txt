3.     Analysis
a.    
Motion
v. Petition
Plaintiff improperly seeks relief
in connection with a pending action.  Since
proper claim filing or obtaining relief from the claim filing requirements is a
prerequisite to suit against the public entity, §946.6 contemplates a petition
for relief in a separate civil proceeding—not a “motion” for relief in an
action that has already been filed against the entity. §946.6(a) states the
proper place for filing the petition is “a court that would be a proper court
for the trial of an action on the cause of action to which the claim relates …”
(emphasis added).)  Luers v. Smith (CD CA
1996) 941 F.Supp. 105, 107.  
 
Notably, Gov Code §946.6(f)
provides, “If the court makes an order relieving the petitioner from Section
945.4, suit on the cause of action to which the claim relates shall be filed
with the court within 30 days thereafter.” 

 
b.    
Timeliness
of Petition
Additionally, the petition was not
timely filed.  Plaintiff served LBUSD
with his application for leave to file late claim on 9/19/23.  LBUSD corresponded with Plaintiff on 9/29/23,
but did not indicate it was accepting or denying the claim in its
correspondence.  By operation of law, the
claim was deemed denied 45 days after it was presented and not accepted.  Gov Code §911.6(c).  Plaintiff contends, without authority, that
the 45 days commenced running on 9/29/23, the date of correspondence.  Per the statute, however, it commenced
running on 9/19/23, the date the claim was presented.  The claim was therefore deemed denied by
operation of law 45 days later, which fell on Friday, 11/03/23.  
 
Pursuant to CCP §946.6, Plaintiff
had six months from the time the claim was denied to petition the court for
relief from timely claim filing requirements. 
Six months after 11/03/23 fell on May 3, 2024.  Plaintiff did not file this petition until
8/07/24, several months too late.  
 
The petition is therefore
denied.    
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.
