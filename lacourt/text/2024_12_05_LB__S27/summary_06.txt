Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages against the defendant, Victor Ortega, in a lawsuit filed by the plaintiff, Arturo Callejas, for damages arising from an automobile accident. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant was intoxicated at the time of the accident, but the complaint does not specify the level of intoxication or any additional aggravating factors. The court finds that the complaint fails to meet the requirements for punitive damages under California Civil Code ยง3294, which requires that the conduct be "despicable" and demonstrate a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of others. The court grants the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages, but grants the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint if it can be shown that the defendant was indeed intoxicated and that the accident was caused by his reckless behavior. The court also permits discovery relating to allegations of intoxication to go forward.
