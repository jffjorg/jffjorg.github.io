 Case Number:  24LBCV00861    Hearing Date:   December 5, 2024    Dept:  S27 On 9/26/24, during a Case
Management Conference, the Court specially set a hearing on Defendant’s motion
to compel arbitration.  Pursuant to CCP
§1005, and in light of the intervening holidays, moving papers for a 12/05/24
hearing were due on or before 11/08/24. 
The Court has not received timely moving papers.  The hearing is therefore taken off
calendar.  
 
The parties are reminded that the continued CMC
remains on calendar for 12/05/24.  The
Court asks the parties to make arrangements to appear remotely at the CMC.
