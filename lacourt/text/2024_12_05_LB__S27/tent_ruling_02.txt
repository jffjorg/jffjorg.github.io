 Case Number:  23LBCV00572    Hearing Date:   December 5, 2024    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff reserved a hearing on a
motion for attorneys’ fees and scheduled the hearing for 2/27/25.  On 10/09/24, the Court held an OSC re:
dismissal (settlement), and rescheduled the hearing for 12/05/24.  The parties waived notice.  Pursuant to CCP §1005, and in light of the
intervening holidays, moving papers for a 12/05/24 hearing were due on or
before 11/08/24.  The Court has not
received timely moving papers.  The
hearing is therefore taken off calendar. 

 
The parties are reminded that the
OSC re: dismissal (settlement) remains on calendar for 12/05/24.  The Court asks the parties to make
arrangements to appear remotely at the OSC.
