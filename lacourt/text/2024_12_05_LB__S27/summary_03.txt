And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving multiple plaintiffs, including minors, who have filed a Notice of Settlement. The court has set a hearing to approve the settlements for the minors and has continued an OSC (Order to Show Cause) re: dismissal (settlement) to the same date and time. The petitioner has filed papers in support of the petition, but they were filed late, on December 3, 2024, rather than at least 16 court days prior to the hearing. The hearing has been continued to January 7, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. in Department S27. The judge is requiring the petitioner to give prompt notice to all parties of the papers filed in support of the petition. Parties who intend to submit on the tentative must email the court to indicate their intention to do so. If a party does not submit on the tentative, they must make arrangements to appear remotely at the hearing.
