And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motion for attorneys' fees filed by the plaintiff and has granted the motion. The plaintiff is seeking to recover $36,754 in attorneys' fees, $18,377 as a lodestar enhancement, and $9049.48 in costs and expenses. The defendant failed to file a timely opposition to the motion, and the court will not consider a late-filed opposition.

The court has reviewed the Declaration of Roger Kirnos in support of the motion and finds that the fees incurred to date are both actually and reasonably incurred. However, the court will not award the $2700 sought to review the opposition and prepare a reply because no opposition papers were filed.

The court finds that $34,043 in attorneys' fees was reasonably and necessarily incurred. The court also declines to award a multiplier to the attorneys' fees because the hourly rates charged are sufficient to compensate counsel for the time spent pursuing the case.

Finally, the court notes that the motion also seeks recovery of costs, but any award of costs will be made in connection with the memorandum of costs filed by the plaintiff on August 6, 2024.
