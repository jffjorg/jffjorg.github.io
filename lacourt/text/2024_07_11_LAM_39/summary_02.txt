The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings by Pitzer College (Defendant) against Brendan Schultz (Plaintiff). The Plaintiff alleges that he was discriminated against based on his race or ethnicity and that the Defendant retaliated against him by failing to endorse his application for a grant as an alumnus. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff's claims are invalid and that the Plaintiff has failed to state a cause of action under the Unruh Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Judge has granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the first cause of action (Unruh Civil Rights Act) and has granted leave to amend. The Judge has also granted the motion as to the seventh, ninth, tenth, and eleventh causes of action (fraud, negligent misrepresentation, willful misconduct, reckless misconduct, and gross negligence) without leave to amend. The Plaintiff is ordered to file an amended complaint within 10 days of notice of this order.
