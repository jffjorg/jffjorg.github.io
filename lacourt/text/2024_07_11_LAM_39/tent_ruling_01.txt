MOTION:  


Motion for Attorneys’ Fees
Application for Pro Hac Vice Admission




MOVING PARTY:


Defendant Walgreen Co.




OPPOSING PARTY:


Plaintiff Demesne Corporation



 
MOTIONS
            In
its order of March 13, 2024, the court granted Defendant Walgreen Co.’s
(“Defendant”) motion for summary judgment as against Plaintiff Demesne
Corporation (“Plaintiff”). Now, Defendant seeks attorney fees.  Plaintiff opposes
the motion.  Defendant also moves for
admission of its counsel pro hac vice as of the date of Defendant’s
appearance in this action. 
ANALYSIS
The prevailing
party must seek an award of attorney fees by way of a noticed motion and bears
the burden of proof to justify the amount sought.  (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(c)(5)(A).)  
Defendant contends
its attorneys billed $160,582.92 in fees. 
This lodestar figure is based on billing at hourly rates between $355
and $705 per hour for attorneys and $200 to $230 per hour for paralegals.  “The reasonable market value of the
attorney's services is the measure of a reasonable hourly rate.  This standard applies regardless of whether
the attorneys claiming fees charge nothing for their services, charge at
below-market or discounted rates, represent the client on a straight contingent
fee basis, or are in-house counsel.”  (Chacon
v. Litke (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 1234, 1260, internal quotations and
citations omitted.)  
Based on the court’s
experience in reviewing requests for attorney fees in similar litigation and
the evidence before the court, the court concludes these hourly rates are
reasonable for attorneys and paralegals engaged in similar litigation in the
Los Angeles area.  (Declaration of Shanon
J. McGinnis, ¶¶ 19-25; see Stratton v. Beck (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 483,
496.)  But Defendant’s attorneys chose to
staff this case with an attorney who is not admitted to practice in California,
Taylor E. Pernini (“Pernini”).  In
connection with this motion for attorneys’ fees, Defendant moves to admit
Pernini pro hac vice.  Pernini is
admitted to practice in Georgia, and related federal courts.  (See Declaration of Taylor E. Pernini, ¶¶ 2,
3.)  Defendant advances no evidence on
the typical hourly rates of attorneys admitted to practice in Georgia. While
Defendant requests that the court admit Pernini pro hac vice as of the
date Defendant appeared in this matter, Defendant cites no authority for the court
to do so in these circumstances.  
Defendant cites United
States Golf Assn. v. Arroyo Software Corp. (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 607, 624 for
the proposition the court has authority to enter pro hac vice orders
nunc pro tunc.  Defendant cites no
authority it is proper to do so for purposes of obtaining an award of attorney
fees in connection with a fully litigated matter.  The court, therefore, denies the application
for pro hac vice admission and declines to award Defendant the $40,205.50
in attorney fees Defendant asserts Pernini billed.  Accordingly, the court adjusts the lodestar
figure to $120,377.42.
Further, as Plaintiff
points out, Defendant’s request for attorney fees is excessive.  “A reduced award might be fully justified by
a general observation that an attorney over litigated a case or submitted a
padded bill or that the opposing party has stated valid objections.”  (Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp.
(2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 44, 101.)  In this
case, the billing records reflect Defendant’s attorneys billed $81,408.50 in
January 2024, which is more than $4,070 per workday.  The billing records also reflect substantial
duplication of effort between attorneys. 
For example, in January, 2024 Defendant’s attorneys spent 35.8 hours in
connection with the summary judgment motion, with all three attorneys billing
time.  Using all three attorneys to work
on the summary judgment motion was inefficient and necessarily involved
duplication of work, based on the tasks reported to have been performed.  Defendant’s summary judgment motion was brief
and straightforward, with a memorandum of points and authorities less than thirteen
pages in length, and only the lease agreements between the parties and the
deposition testimony of Plaintiff’s person most knowledgeable were submitted as
evidence.  Such a motion did not reasonably
require 35.8 hours to prepare.  
Accordingly, in addition
to discounting the time billed by Perrini, the court applies a negative
multiplier of 0.75 to the lodestar amount and awards Defendant attorney fees in
the amount of $90,283.07.  The court
declines to award Defendant its attorney fees requested in connection with this
motion, as Defendant’s evidence as to those fees is speculative.
Defendant also
seeks costs and expenses through the filing of this motion.  Defendant is required to do so by filing a
cost memorandum (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1700, subd. (a)), which the court
notes defendant filed and served on April 18, 2024.  
Defendant is ordered to provide notice of this order and to
file proof of service concerning it.
