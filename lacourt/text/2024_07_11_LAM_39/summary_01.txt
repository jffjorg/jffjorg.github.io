And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for attorneys' fees and an application for pro hac vice admission. The defendant, Walgreen Co., seeks attorney fees of $160,582.92 for work done on the case, while the plaintiff, Demesne Corporation, opposes the motion. The court concludes that the hourly rates of the attorneys are reasonable, but denies the application for pro hac vice admission as there is no evidence of typical hourly rates for attorneys admitted to practice in Georgia. The court also adjusts the lodestar figure to $120,377.42 and awards the defendant attorney fees in the amount of $90,283.07. The court notes that the defendant's request for attorney fees is excessive and that there was duplication of effort between attorneys.
