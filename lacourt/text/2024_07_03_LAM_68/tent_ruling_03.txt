RELIEF
REQUESTED
Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories (set one)
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiffs
were tenants of a single family dwelling at 32270 Saticoy Street, West Hills,
and allege unsanitary and/or unsafe conditions on the premises as a result of
improper maintenance and upkeep. 
 
On
October 17, 2022, Plaintiffs filed their complaint for Failure to Provide
Habitable Dwellings, Breach of Covenant of Right to Quiet Enjoyment and
Possession of the Property, Nuisance, and Negligence. Defendants answered the
complaint on February 23, 2023.
 
RULING: Granted.
Defendant, Samuel Welch moves to compel further responses to
form interrogatories (set one), numbers 6.4, 6.5, 6.7, 7.1, 7.2, 8.7, 9.1, 9.2,
10.3, 12.1, 12.4, and 12.7 from Plaintiff, Shenikwa Malone. The responses
consist of incomplete replies, with minimal answers, assurances of later
production, or references to other parties and non-parties responsible for the
provision of phone number and address information.
 
The responses are incomplete in that they fail to respond to
all subcategories of the requests. The references to other persons constitutes
an improper, factually incomplete answer. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 783–784 [“Answers must be complete and responsive. Thus, it is
not proper to answer by stating, ‘See my deposition’, ’See my pleading’, or
‘See the financial statement’”].)
 
Furthermore, Plaintiff, Shenikwa Malone has not filed an
opposition contesting the arguments set forth by the instant motion nor to
indicate that supplemental responses have already been provided such that the
motion would be rendered moot. 
 
The motion is therefore granted. Responding party is ordered
to serve responses in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.210-20310240.
No sanctions requested. 
 
The court calendar shows six (6) remaining, scheduled
motions to compel further responses through July 22, 2024. The motions appear
as a continuation of discovery issues addressed by the court in the 23 motions
to compel responses granted on November 22, 2023.
 
The court does not conduct any informal discovery conferences.
While the court understands the prior use and perhaps reliance on the IDC
system, the court finds the number of items on the court calendar through the
next three months presents a potentially inordinate burden. The court reserves
the right to set an OSC re: Discovery Referee in lieu of a hearing on any given
motion, and may take off any and all motions in lieu of the OSC hearing. The
court invites the parties to continue meeting and conferring, including the
provision of supplemental responses, when possible. 
 
Next
motions to compel further responses as to Jada Gradney set for July 8, 2024.
 
Defendant
to give notice.
