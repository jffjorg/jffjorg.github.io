And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to reclassify the case from unlimited jurisdiction to limited jurisdiction. The defendant argued that the plaintiff has no plans for future treatment and has not treated since 2018, and that the plaintiff's known medical expenses total approximately $2,850 and the plaintiff is alleging property damages of $330. The plaintiff, on the other hand, argued that she will incur approximately $6,000 in future treatment and $250,000 in general damages. The judge found that it does not appear to a high level of certainty that the plaintiff cannot recover more than the jurisdictional amount, especially considering that the plaintiff has a claim for general damages, which are not subject to precise measurement, and thus, the possibility exists that the plaintiff's total damages could exceed the jurisdictional limit. The court also noted that the plaintiff's opposition was untimely, but exercised its discretion in considering the merits of the opposition.
