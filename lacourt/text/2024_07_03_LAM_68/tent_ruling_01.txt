MOTION TO RECLASSIFY (WALKER MOTION)
 
MOVING PARTY:  Defendant
Today’s IV, Inc.
RESPONDING PARTY:  Plaintiff
Marieli Zayas
 
RELIEF REQUESTED 
Defendant
moves to reclassify this case as a limited jurisdiction action.
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION 
 
On June 17, 2020,
Plaintiff Marieli Zayas filed a complaint against Defendants Westin Bonaventure
Hotel & Suites, and Today’s IV, Inc., among others, alleging causes of
action for (1) battery; (2) negligence; (3) intentional infliction of emotional
distress; (4) fraudulent concealment; (5) private nuisance; and (6) public
nuisance. 
 
On December 21,
2022, Plaintiff filed the first amended complaint. Plaintiff alleges that she
was bitten by bed bugs at Westin Bonaventure, and after she informed hotel
management, an investigation revealed that her room was found positive for bed
bugs.
 
On February 23,
2023, the court sustained Defendant Today IV, Inc.’s demurrer without leave to
amend as to all causes of action except for negligence.
 
On March 28,
2024, Defendant Today’s IV, Inc. filed this motion to reclassify. On June 26,
2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. No reply has been filed.
 
RULING Denied.
 
As an
initial matter, Plaintiff’s opposition is untimely.  Plaintiff’s
opposition was filed on June 26, 2024.  Plaintiff’s Opposition was due
nine court days before the May 28, 2024 hearing date, which was June 18,
2024.  Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b). Plaintiff’s counsel states that
his father was hospitalized and recently had surgery. (Janfaza Decl., ¶
3.) “A
trial court has broad discretion to overlook late-served papers and to resolve
the matter on the merits.”   (Gonzalez v. Santa Clara County Dept.
of Social Services (2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 162, 168 [“(E)ven if the service
had been untimely, the trial court was vested with discretion to overlook the
defect”]; see also Bozzi v. Nordstrom, Inc.  (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th
755, 765 [“A trial court has broad discretion under rule 3.1300(d) of the Rules
of Court to refuse to consider papers served and filed beyond the deadline
without a prior court order finding good cause for late submission.”].) However,
the Court will exercise its discretion in considering the merits of the
opposition.
Defendant
moves to reclassify this case from unlimited jurisdiction to limited
jurisdiction, arguing that Plaintiff admittedly has no plans for future
treatment and has not treated since 2018. Plaintiff’s known medical expenses
total approximately $2,850.00 and Plaintiff is alleging property
damages of $330 per her discovery responses. (Samuels Decl., ¶¶ 2-5, Exs. A-D.)
Defendant contends that although Plaintiff initially claimed she was
“evaluating her options” for future treatment, as of her October 10, 2023
deposition, she testified she had no future medical appointments on calendar
and only identified the treatment with the three medical providers disclosed in
her discovery responses. (Samuels Decl., ¶¶ 8-11; Ex. B: See Response to Form
Interrogatory Number 6.7; Ex. F: pgs. 70:25 – 71:4; 74:13-17, 22-24.) 
“If a party files a motion for reclassification after the
time for that party to amend that party’s initial pleading or to respond to a
complaint, the court shall grant the motion and enter an order for
reclassification only if both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
 
(1) the
case is incorrectly classified. 
(2)  the moving party shows good cause for not seeking
reclassification earlier.” 
 
(Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 403.040(b).)
 
The court can transfer an action to limited jurisdiction if “it becomes clear
that the matter will ‘necessarily’ result in a verdict below the superior court
jurisdictional amount.” (Walker v.
Superior Court (1992) 53 Cal.
3d 257, 262.)
 
The standard
requires a “high level of certainty” that a damage award will not exceed
jurisdictional limits. 
 
“The court
explained: ‘This standard requires¿a high level of certainty¿that
a damage award will not exceed $25,000 and is not satisfied by a finding that
such an award is merely 'unlikely' or 'not reasonably probable.' " (Id.
at p. 269, italics added.) Consequently, in deciding this issue, the trial
court is¿not permitted to determine the merits of the plaintiff's
claim(s); its sole inquiry is whether ‘the verdict will 'necessarily' fall
short of the superior court jurisdictional requirement of a claim exceeding
$25,000." (Singer v. Superior Court (1999) 70
Cal. App. 4th 1315, 1320.)
 
Plaintiff argues
she will incur approximately $6,000 in future treatment, including
$4,000-$6,000 for IPL treatments, and $2,000-$4,000 for further psychological
counseling. Plaintiff argues she is also claiming $250,000 in general damages.
 
The court finds
that it does not appear to a high level of certainty that Plaintiff cannot
recover more than the jurisdictional amount, especially considering that Plaintiff
has a claim for general damages, which are not subject to precise measurement,
and thus, the possibility exists that Plaintiff’s total damages could exceed
the jurisdictional limit. (Singer, supra,
70 Cal. App. 4th at 1320.)
 
The motion to
reclassify is denied.
 
Plaintiff to
provide notice.
