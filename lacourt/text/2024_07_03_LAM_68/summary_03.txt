And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, Samuel Welch, and granted his motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories from the plaintiff, Shenikwa Malone. The judge found that the plaintiff's responses were incomplete and failed to respond to all subcategories of the requests. The judge also noted that the plaintiff had not filed an opposition to the motion and had not indicated that supplemental responses had already been provided. The judge ordered the plaintiff to serve complete responses in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.210-2031.240. The judge also reserved the right to set an OSC re: Discovery Referee in lieu of a hearing on any given motion and invited the parties to continue meeting and conferring, including the provision of supplemental responses, when possible.
