Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in YAML format:

**Case Information**

* Case Number: 21STCV25399
* Hearing Date: July 3, 2024
* Dept: 68 Dept. 68

**Parties**

* Moving Party: Plaintiffs, 828 Media Capital, et al.
* Responding Party: Defendants, SSS Film Capital, LLC, et al.

**Relief Requested**

* Motion for Determination of Privileged Material

**Summary of Action**

* The case involves a dispute over the financing and production of a film, with allegations of breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and intentional interference with contract.
* The parties have filed various complaints and motions, including a motion to determine whether certain documents are privileged.

**Judge's Ruling**

* The court grants the motion to deem the communications privileged.
* The court finds that the communications between the parties' lawyers and the parties themselves are privileged, and that any waiver of the privilege is ineffective.
* The court declines to conduct an in camera review of the documents or to make any findings about the existence of a joint client relationship.

**Points of Law**

* The attorney-client privilege is waived if the holder of the privilege discloses a significant part of the communication or consents to disclosure.
* A corporate entity is not a "person" for purposes of waiving the attorney-client privilege.
* The determination of waiver is a question of fact, and the trial court's finding, if supported by sufficient evidence, is binding on the appellate court.

**Next Steps**

* The parties are advised to adhere to the findings and guidelines in the ruling.
* The court reserves the right to appoint a discovery referee if the parties require potential review on an item-by-item basis beyond the resources of the court.
* Two special motions to strike are scheduled to begin on August 6 and 22, 2024, respectively.
