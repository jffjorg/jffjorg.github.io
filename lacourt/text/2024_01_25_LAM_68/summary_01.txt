Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for a stay of the action pending adjudication of the writ of mandate. The court finds that the damages claim submitted in the subject action at a minimum effectively requires a finding of the impacts of required mitigation measures, which are part of the writ of mandate. The court also finds that the circumstances of the currently negotiated process constitute a land use/development right public versus private debate, and therefore a regulatory taking issue for purposes of considering the imposition of a stay. The court is granting the motion to stay the action pending adjudication of the writ of mandate. A case management conference is set for February 1, 2024, and the court will set an OSC re: Status of the Writ of Mandate and Stay of the Action.
