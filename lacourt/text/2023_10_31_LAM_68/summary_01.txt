And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court has made a tentative ruling on the motion for security filed by Joseph Chang, the Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant. Chang is seeking security from DRC Capital, LLC, the Defendant and Cross-Complainant, for his defense against DRC Capital's derivative claims. Chang argues that there is no reasonable possibility that DRC Capital's claims will benefit the SFR Fund, as the Fund released all its claims against him through a Separation and Release Agreement. The Court agrees with Chang and is inclined to order DRC Capital to furnish security. However, the Court requires Chang to provide evidence supporting his request for $50,000 in security, which is the maximum amount allowed by law. The Court will consider evidence of Chang's reasonable expenses and attorney's fees in determining the amount of security.
