 Case Number:  23SSTCV15448    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2023    Dept:  68 Judge Douglas W. Stern makes the following disclosure.  From October 2009 until March 2012, I was Vice President and Litigation Manager of Fidelity National Law Group, the law firm that represents Defendant Shalimar Escrow, Inc.  In that role I was the head of in-house litigation initially for the entire southern California region and then for the region from Los Angeles County east to Nevada and south to the southern border. Since 2012 I have had no continuing relationship with Fidelity National Law Group or any Fidelity entity. I do not believe that my employment 12 years ago requires that I recuse myself.  If any party believes that the Court is required to recuse itself, they should make that claim known to the Court.
