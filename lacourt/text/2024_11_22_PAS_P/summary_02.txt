And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer filed by Augusto Coen-Brown (also referred to as Augusto Coyne) to the entire Complaint filed by Yadira Alejandra Torres. Augusto argued that the Complaint does not adequately state any causes of action against him, and the judge agrees that the Complaint does not contain sufficient facts to state a cause of action against Augusto. However, the judge is granting leave to amend the Complaint, allowing Plaintiff to correct the deficiencies and refile the lawsuit. The judge is requiring Plaintiff to file an amended Complaint within 20 days.
