            Plaintiff
Charlene Parker (“Plaintiff”) initiated this action against Defendants
Starbucks Corporation, a Washington Corporation (“Starbucks”); DWHJR Holdings
LLC, a California Limited Liability Company; and Does 1 to 50 (collectively,
“Defendants”), asserting claims for (1) General Negligence, (2) Products

filed the instant motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition. The motion is
unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
            Code Civ.
Proc. §2025.450 provides relief where a party fails to appear for deposition
without having served a valid objection. It provides as follows:
(a) If, after service of a
deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer, director, managing
agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that
is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection
under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it,
or to produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the
notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and
testimony, and the production for inspection of any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.
(b) A motion under subdivision (a)
shall comply with both of the following:
(1) [omitted]
(2) The motion shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when
the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents,
electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition
notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent
to inquire about the nonappearance.
. . .
(g)(1) If a motion under
subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.
(2) On motion of any other party
who, in person or by attorney, attended at the time and place specified in the
deposition notice in the expectation that the deponent's testimony would be
taken, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) in favor of that party and against the deponent or the
party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust..
III.      ANALYSIS
            Defendant
Starbucks moves to compel Plaintiff Charlene Parker’s deposition, asserting
that Plaintiff has failed to appear for deposition despite being properly
served with three deposition notices. Starbucks contends that these
nonappearances have hindered the discovery process and delayed its ability to
prepare for trial.
Starbucks served its first Notice
of Deposition and Request for Production of Documents on April 4, 2024,
scheduling the deposition for April 30, 2024. On April 23, 2024, Plaintiff’s
counsel informed Defendant’s counsel that Plaintiff would not attend due to a
medical condition. (Melo Decl., ¶ 3a; Exh. C.)
Starbucks served a second
deposition notice on May 16, 2024, setting the deposition for July 2, 2024. On
June 26, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel again notified Starbucks’ counsel that
Plaintiff could not attend, citing her ongoing medical condition. (Melo Decl.,
¶ 3b; Exh. E.)
A third deposition notice was served on August 12, 2024,
scheduling the deposition for September 25, 2024. The day before the
deposition, Plaintiff’s counsel informed Starbucks that Plaintiff would not
appear. Starbucks subsequently obtained a Certificate of Non-Appearance from
the court reporter. (Melo Decl., ¶¶ 3c-d; Exhs. F, G.)
Despite these three attempts,
Plaintiff has failed to appear or provide an alternative date for deposition.
Starbucks’s counsel inquired on October 21, 2024, regarding Plaintiff’s
availability but received no response. (Melo Decl., ¶ 3e; Exh. H.)
Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2025.450, subdivision (a), a party may move to compel a deposition if
the deponent fails to appear after being properly noticed. The moving party
must demonstrate good cause for the deposition and submit a declaration
detailing attempts to meet and confer. Here, Starbucks has satisfied these
requirements by filing this motion, outlining the necessity of Plaintiff’s
deposition to evaluate her claims and damages, and demonstrating repeated
efforts to secure her attendance.
The Court finds that Plaintiff’s
failure to provide alternative dates, lack of communication regarding the
September 25, 2024, notice, and the absence of opposition to this motion lack
substantial justification. Defendant has made repeated good faith attempts to
depose Plaintiff, who has yet to comply with her discovery obligations.
Accordingly, Starbucks motion to
compel deposition of Plaintiff is GRANTED
Sanctions
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a), authorizes the Court to impose a monetary sanction
for misuse of the discovery process, requiring the offending party, or their
attorney, to pay the reasonable expenses incurred by the opposing party,
including attorney’s fees. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any
provision of this title, the Court must impose that sanction unless it finds
that the offending party acted with substantial justification or that the
imposition of the sanction would be unjust.
When a motion to compel under
Section 2025.450(a) is granted, the Court is required to impose monetary
sanctions in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the
deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the Court
finds that the subject of the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that the circumstances render the imposition of the sanction unjust. (C.C.P. §
2025.450(c)(1)). The purpose of discovery sanctions is to prevent abuse of the
discovery process and to correct the problem presented. (Do v. Superior
Court (2003) 109 Cal. App. 4th 1210, 1213.)
Defendant Starbucks Corporation
seeks $1,060.00 in monetary sanctions, which includes 2.5 hours for preparing
the motion, 1.0 hour for preparing a reply to any opposition, 0.5 hour for
appearing remotely for the hearing, and $60 for the filing fee. Defendant’s
counsel charges $250 per hour, a rate the Court finds reasonable. (Melo Decl.,
¶ 4.).However, given the lack of
complexity of the motion and the absence of any opposition, the Court finds
that some of the requested time is excessive. The Court awards sanctions for
1.5 hours spent preparing the motion, 0.5 hour for attending the hearing, and
the $60 filing fee, for a total of $560.00.     The Court imposes
monetary sanctions in the amount of $560.00 on Plaintiff.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER
          Starbucks' motion to compel Plaintiff's deposition is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is ordered to appear for deposition within 30 days of this order. Failure to abide by this order may result in Plaintiff being
precluded from testifying at trial.  Starbucks’ request for monetary
sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $560.00 as to Plaintiff.
 Starbucks is ordered to give notice.
