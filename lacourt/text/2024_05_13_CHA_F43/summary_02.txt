And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling is in response to JETNET, LLC's demurrer to the second cause of action of the cross-complaint filed by Golden Hammer Ops, LLC and Gregory Rowlee. The court found that the second cause of action, which alleges breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, is unclear and confusing. The court sustained JETNET's demurrer and gave the cross-complainants 30 days to amend the cause of action. The court noted that the cross-complainants should either make this a breach of contract cause of action or a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing cause of action, or split this cause of action into two separate causes of action.
