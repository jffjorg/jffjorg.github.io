STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a breach of contract
case. Plaintiffs purchased a property from Defendant which Plaintiffs allege
was subject to a PACE loan. Plaintiffs allege that Defendant agreed to pay off
the loan through escrow, such that the property would be transferred to
Plaintiffs clear of any lien but failed to do so, despite receiving money in an
amount equal to the balance on the loan, from escrow. 
 
            Cross-Defendants
One Key Escrow Corp., Manuel Morales, and Ruby Tang move to enforce the terms
of a settlement between Cross-Defendants and Cross-Complainant. 
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Cross-Defendants
One Key Escrow Corp., Manuel Morales, and Ruby Tang move to enforce the terms
of a settlement between Cross-Defendants and Cross-Complainant. 
 
            No proof of
service was filed with this motion, and no response has been received from
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Maria De Lourdes Ruiz. On this record, the Court
cannot conclude that the moving parties gave notice as required by Code of
Civil Procedure section 1005(b) and thus does not reach the merits of the
motion at this time. 
 
            Accordingly,
Cross-Defendants’ Motion to Enforce Settlement is CONTINUED to Thursday, April
25, 2024. at 9:00 AM. 
 
            Cross-Defendants
are ordered to serve all moving papers and the Court’s ruling today on all
parties and file proof of service with the Court before 5:00 PM on Thursday,
April 4, 2024. Opposition and reply briefs shall be served and filed per code. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
Dated: March 29, 2024.                                  ___________________________________

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
