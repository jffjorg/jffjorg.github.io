```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's special motion to strike the complaint in its entirety. The defendant, CYP LLC, argued that the entire lawsuit is based on protected activity, specifically the defendant's refusal to approve the plaintiff's request to install new playground equipment. The judge found that the defendant's reasons for denying the request were grounded in a pending judicial proceeding, but that the statements giving those reasons were collateral to the plaintiff's contract claims and did not constitute protected activity. The judge therefore concluded that the complaint does not arise out of protected activity and denied the defendant's special motion to strike.
