And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a breach of contract case involving a property purchase and a PACE loan. The Cross-Defendants, One Key Escrow Corp., Manuel Morales, and Ruby Tang, are seeking to enforce the terms of a settlement between them and the Cross-Complainant, Maria De Lourdes Ruiz. However, the judge has ruled that the Cross-Defendants failed to provide proof of service and the Cross-Complainant failed to respond to the motion, and therefore, the court cannot reach the merits of the motion at this time. The motion is continued to April 25, 2024, and the Cross-Defendants are ordered to serve all moving papers and the court's ruling on all parties and file proof of service with the court before April 4, 2024.
