And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling from the judge in a legal malpractice case. The defendant, WFBM, has moved to compel further responses to discovery requests from the cross-defendant, Frank Fletcher. The defendant claims that the cross-defendant has not provided any responses, which has resulted in a waiver of objections. The judge finds that the motion to compel is moot because the cross-defendant has already served responses before filing its opposition. The judge also declines to impose sanctions on the cross-defendant because the opposing arguments are substantially justified. The judge will discuss with the parties a plan to schedule an independent discovery conference on the waiver issue and to move the hearing on the cross-defendant's motion to be heard simultaneously with the motion for relief from waiver filed by Cross-Defendant Outside GC, LLC.
