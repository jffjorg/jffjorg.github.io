  Case Number:  21STCV13121    Hearing Date:   November 16, 2023    Dept:  55 Motion to Compel Further Document
Responses
In this legal malpractice case, Defendant WFBM moves
for an order compelling responses of Cross-Defendant Frank Fletcher to the first
set of requests for production of documents without objections, production of
all responsive documents and for sanctions against Cross-Defendant in the
amount of $2,180.00.  
Defendant contends that Cross-Defendant has yet to
provide any responses to the requests propounded, which has resulted in a
waiver of objections for failing to timely respond to discovery (citing, e.g.,
CCP  § 2031.300(a)).   
Cross-Defendant served responses before filing his
opposition. The Court therefore exercises its discretion to take the motion to
compel off calendar as moot. The Court also declines to impose sanctions against
Cross-Defendant because arguably CCP  §
2031.320, which mandates sanctions for a party “who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel” does not apply in cases like this where the motion
to compel is moot. Even if Section 2031.320 did apply, however, the Court finds
that Cross-Defendant’s opposing arguments are substantially justified and thus
sanctions are unwarranted. 
Cross-Defendant has separately filed a motion for
relief from waiver of his objections to the document requests, which is set for
hearing in April 2024. The Court will discuss with the parties at the hearing a
plan for a) scheduling an IDC on the waiver issue regarding both Cross-Defendant and Cross-Defendant Outside GC, LLC  to prevent additional, costly
motion practice, and b) moving the hearing on Cross-Defendant’s motion so that
it can be heard simultaneously with the motion for relief from waiver filed by
Cross-Defendant Outside GC, LLC.
