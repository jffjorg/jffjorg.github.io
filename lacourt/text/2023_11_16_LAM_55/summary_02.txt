And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the prior ruling that compelled arbitration. The plaintiff had argued that the prior ruling was incorrect based on recent case law, including Ford Motor Warranty Cases (Ochoa, et al.) (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324. However, the judge concluded that the prior ruling was proper and that the pleading fits within opinions upholding arbitration compelling. The judge also noted that even if the prior ruling was error, it was still correct under another line of authority, so there was discretion as to which line to follow.
