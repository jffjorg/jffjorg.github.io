And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of We Are Reality, Inc. v. Pieces, LP, et al. The case involves an unlawful detainer complaint filed by We Are Reality, Inc. against Pieces, LP, alleging that Pieces, LP failed to pay rent and was served a three-day notice to pay rent or quit. The judge has granted Pieces, LP's Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment and has recalled and quashed the writ of possession.

The judge has also granted Pieces, LP's Motion for Order to Stay Writ of Possession, finding that the case contains a complicated ownership issue and that the writ of possession should be stayed to promote judicial efficiency and to prevent prejudice to Pieces, LP.

The judge has noted that the parties have agreed to negotiate a reasonable reimbursement amount for the costs of the motion to vacate, and if they are unable to agree, the court will make an award.
