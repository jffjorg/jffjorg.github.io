significant_statements:
  - The Court is puzzled by DRAKK's argument that Defendant failed to provide admissible evidence that the Property complied with the Conditions of Approval.
  - The filing of the Final Parcel Map establishes "local approval" and proves compliance with the Subdivision Map Act.
  - The Court's tentative ruling to grant the defense MSJ posits that PSIP has carried its initial burden on an MSJ, so the burden is shifted to DRAKK to show a disputed issue that is material to the determination of the motion.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions for summary judgment and objection to notice of motion to quash deposition ruling. The judge has continued the Zion Bank deposition to allow its completion and has tentatively ruled that the deposition must go forward. The judge has also requested that the parties file supplemental briefs on the issues raised by the Zion Bank testimony and will take oral argument on the date of the continued hearing. The judge has tentatively found that the argument on the closing date does not raise a triable issue of fact and has puzzled over the argument that the defendant failed to provide admissible evidence of compliance with the conditions of approval. The judge has ordered the parties to file additional briefs on the issues raised by the Zion Bank testimony and will take oral argument on the date of the continued hearing.
