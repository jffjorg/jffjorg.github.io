Here is a summary in English text:

Judge Theresa M. Traber has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint in interpleader filed by California TD Specialists, the defendant in a lawsuit brought by Nancy Goulston. The lawsuit alleges that the defendant failed to properly disburse the proceeds from a Trustee's Sale. The defendant seeks to deposit the disputed funds with the Court and file a cross-complaint in interpleader, alleging that three other entities have claims to the surplus funds from the foreclosure sale. The judge grants the motion, ordering the defendant to file a clean, stand-alone copy of the proposed cross-complaint and deposit the disputed funds with the Court within 10 days. The judge declines to address the validity of the liens asserted by the other entities, stating that such questions go to the merits of the complaint and are more properly resolved in a motion challenging the merits.
