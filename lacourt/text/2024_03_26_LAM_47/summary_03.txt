And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Theresa M. Traber, is considering a motion by Attorney Steven M. Rubin to withdraw as counsel for Plaintiff Hui Su in an employment discrimination action against AHMC Garfield Medical Center. The motion is granted. The court finds that the circumstances warrant withdrawal, as the attorney-client relationship has broken down and the risk of prejudice to the plaintiff is low. The court notes that the arbitration process is ongoing, and the arbitrator has already granted the request to withdraw. The judge orders that a written notice of this order be served on all parties and filed with the court.
