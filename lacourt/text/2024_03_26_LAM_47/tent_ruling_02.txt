Legal Standard
 
            Enforcement
of settlement agreements is governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.
This statute provides, in relevant part:
 
If the
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of
the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement. 
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6(a).) The
Court is empowered under this section to resolve reasonable disputes over the
terms of a settlement. (Machado v. Myers (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 779,
795.) The Court does not insert provisions into the parties’ agreement but
applies the rules of contractual interpretation to interpretation of the
settlement. (Id. at 792.) When extrinsic evidence is necessary, the
Court may decide the motion on declarations alone. (Richardson v. Richardson
(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 91, 97.) 
 
Compliance With Settlement
 
            On
September 21, 2022, the parties entered into a written settlement agreement in
full resolution of the claims brought by Plaintiffs. (Declaration of Douglas H.
Hoang ISO Mot. ¶¶ 3-4., Exh. A.) Plaintiffs have provided a copy of the
settlement agreement signed by all parties. In that settlement, Defendants
Summit Skilled Trades and JD Meints agreed to pay Plaintiffs specified sums in
exchange for dismissal of this action. (Id. Exh. A.) As relevant here,
Defendant Meints agreed to pay a total of $9,500 to Plaintiffs through their
counsel in two installments. The first installment for $5,000 was due within 20
days of the execution of the agreement, and the remainder was due within 50
days. (Id. Exh. A. ¶ 4.) 
 
            Plaintiff
states that Defendant Meints paid $1,000 on February 15, 2023. (Id. ¶
5.) No other payments have been made to date. (¶¶ 6-7.) The agreement imposes
no obligations on Plaintiffs beyond the release of their claims and dismissal
of this case. The parties stipulated to dismissal of the action with retention
of jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 on April 3, 2023,
pursuant to paragraph 1 of the settlement. (See April 3, 2023 Stipulation,
Hoang Decl. Exh. A ¶ 1.) 
 
            As
the undisputed evidence shows that Defendant Meints has not complied with his
obligations, Plaintiffs are entitled to an order entering judgment for the
balance of the settlement. 
 
Attorney’s Fees
 
            Plaintiffs
also request attorney’s fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1717.
This section provides: 
In any action on a contract, where the
contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are
incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the
parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the
party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in
the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in
addition to other costs.
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1717.) Paragraph 22 of the settlement
agreement empowers any party who prevails on a motion to enforce the agreement
to recover reasonable attorney’s fees. (Hoang Decl. Exh. A. ¶ 22.) 
 
Reasonable
attorney’s fees shall be fixed by the Court and shall be an element of the
costs of suit. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(c)(5)(B).) Reasonable attorney’s fees
are ordinarily determined by the Court pursuant to the “lodestar” method, i.e.,
the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate. (See PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084,
1095-1096; Margolin v. Regional Planning Com. (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999,
1004 [“California courts have consistently held that a computation of time
spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a
determination of an appropriate attorneys' fee award.”].) In setting the hourly rate for a fee
award, courts are entitled to consider the “fees customarily charged by that
attorney and others in the community for similar work.” (Bihun v. AT&T
Info. Sys., Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per
hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin v. Watkins Associated Indus.
(1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 664.)  The burden is on the party seeking attorney’s
fees to prove the reasonableness of the fees. (Center for Biological
Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603,
615.) 
 
The Court has broad discretion in
determining the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee award, which will not be
overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law,
or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi
v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.)  The
Court need not explain its calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded
in detail; identifying the factors considered in arriving at the amount will
suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Indus. Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258,
274-275.)
 
            Here,
Plaintiffs’ counsel states that he incurred 2.5 hours of time preparing these
papers at an hourly rate of $500, plus $60 in filing fees, for a total of
$1,310 in fees and costs. (Hoang Decl. ¶¶ 10-12.) The Court finds this to be a
reasonable amount on a motion of this nature and will therefore award the fees
and costs sought. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Enforce Settlement is GRANTED. 
 
            Judgment
is entered this date for Plaintiffs and against Defendant J.D. Meints in the
amount of $8,500 plus $1,250.00 in attorney’s fees and $60 in costs. 
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
