STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an employment discrimination action. Plaintiff alleges that she
was harassed on the basis of her race and national origin. 
 
Attorney Steven M. Rubin moves to
be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Steven M. Rubin moves to
be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff.
 
Moving counsel filed all three required forms (MC-051,
-052, and -053) separately and included a proof of service as required by
California Rules of Court rule 3.1362(d).  Moving
counsel’s declaration states that he served Plaintiff by mail and confirmed the
address was current by her filings and statements in the arbitration. (MC-052 ¶
3.) 
 
In general, an attorney may withdraw with
or without cause so long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice
to the client’s interest – i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in
the litigation, because that would prejudice client, but can withdraw
otherwise. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904,
915.) The court has discretion to deny an attorney’s request to withdraw where
the withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in the proceeding,
but the court’s discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably. (Mandell
v. Superior Court (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)   
 
Here, this matter is stayed pending
resolution of the binding arbitration to which the parties stipulated. (See
March 21, 2022 Minute Order.) The only hearing before the Court is a status
conference regarding the arbitration set for August 7, 2024. Moreover, the
Arbitrator has separately heard Moving Counsel’s request to be relieved and granted
the request. (MC-052 Attach. 2.) The arbitrator has stayed the arbitration to
permit Plaintiff to find substitute counsel. (Id.) The risk of prejudice
to Plaintiff is therefore low. Moving Counsel’s declaration states that there
has been an irreconcilable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship.
(MC-052 ¶ 2.) Given the evidence of the breakdown in the relationship and the
low risk of prejudice at this juncture, the Court finds that these
circumstances warrant withdrawal.
 
Accordingly, Attorney Steven M. Rubin’s
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff is GRANTED. 
 
            This
ruling is conditioned on Moving Counsel serving written notice of this order on
all parties and filing proof of service with the Court. 
 
Moving Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
