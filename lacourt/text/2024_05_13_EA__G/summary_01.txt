And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the motion of South Coast Air Quality Management District (South Coast AQMD) to enter a stipulated judgment against Ed Hassan Albadry and Aid Builders, Inc. The case involves an environmental enforcement action brought by South Coast AQMD against Albadry and Aid Builders for violating asbestos regulations during a remodeling project in Bellflower. The parties stipulated to the dismissal of the enforcement action, and on September 7, 2023, they signed a settlement agreement. The agreement required Albadry and Aid Builders to pay South Coast AQMD a total of $32,000 in monthly payments. However, Albadry and Aid Builders stopped making payments in November 2023, and now owe an outstanding amount of $24,000. The Judge finds that South Coast AQMD has established the existence of a settlement agreement and grants the motion to enter a stipulated judgment against Albadry and Aid Builders.
