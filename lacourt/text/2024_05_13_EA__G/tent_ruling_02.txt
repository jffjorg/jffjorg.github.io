BACKGROUND
This

Moy, and Does 1-20, alleging the following causes of action: (1) negligence and
(2) premises liability.
On
February 16, 2023, Truong amended the Complaint to replace Doe 1 with Defendant
Colonial Townhomes HOA (Colonial HOA) and Doe 2 with Defendant Moller
Properties, Inc. (Moller).

declaratory relief.
On
April 12, 2023, Colonial HOA filed a cross-complaint against Vuong and Zoes

set for May 13, 2024, and a post-mediation status conference/trial setting
conference is set for July 23, 2024.
ANALYSIS
Nguyen
petitions for the Court’s approval of a $2,050,000.00 settlement reached between
Truong, Colonial HOA, and Vuong. For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS Nguyen’s petition.
Legal Standard
An
enforceable settlement of a minor’s or incompetent’s claim can only be
consummated with court approval. (Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Code
Civ. Proc., § 372.) For this purpose, a petition for approval must be presented
to the court and until it is granted, there is no final settlement. (Scruton
v. Korean Air Lines Co. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-1606.) Any
settlement agreement therefore is voidable by the minor’s guardian ad litem. (Id.,
at p. 1606.)
Probate
Code section 3600, et seq., governs how the settlement proceeds are to be paid.
Pursuant to Probate Code section 3601, the order shall approve payment of
reasonable expenses from the settlement as follows:
The court making the order or giving the judgment
referred to in Section 3600, as a part thereof, shall make a further order
authorizing and directing that such reasonable expenses (medical or otherwise
and including reimbursement to a parent, guardian, or conservator), costs, and
attorney’s fees, as the court shall approve and allow therein, shall be paid
from the money or other property to be paid or delivered for the benefit of the
minor or incompetent person. (Prob. Code, § 3601, subd. (a).)
In
cases pursuant to Probate Code section 3601, “unless the court has approved the
fee agreement in advance, the court must use a reasonable fee standard when
approving and allowing the amount of attorney’s fees payable from money or
property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a minor or a person with a
disability.” (Cal. Rules of Court 7.955, subd. (a)(1).) In doing so, “[t]he
court must give consideration to the terms of any representation agreement made
between the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a
disability and must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and circumstances
existing at the time the agreement was made, except where the attorney and the
representative of the minor or person with a disability contemplated that the
attorney's fee would be affected by later events.” (Cal. Rules of Court 7.955,
subd. (a)(2).)
Discussion
Pursuant
to the settlement agreement reached between the parties, Colonial HOA and Vuong
agreed to pay a total of $2,050,000.00 with $2,000,000.00 from Colonial HOA
through Travelers Insurance Company, $15,000.00 from Vuong through Alliance
United Insurance Company, and $35,000.00 from Safeco Insurance Company.
(Petition, ¶ 10.)
With regards to attorney
fees, a retainer agreement is attached to the Petition as Attachment 17a. In
it, the attorney fees for Truong will be 40% of the gross recovery if the
matter is resolved following the filing of a lawsuit. (Attach. 17a, ¶ 4.) Here,
Truong’s counsel requests $683,333.33 in attorney fees which is 33.33% of
Truong’s total recovery. (Petition, ¶ 13.) Truong’s counsel also provides
declarations which describe counsels’ experience and efforts and estimates
counsel spent over 1,000 hours on the present case. (Attach. 13a, Amiri-Davani
Decl., ¶ 7-15, 21; Dunham Decl., ¶ 7, 15.) Upon review of their declarations,
the Court finds the requested attorney fees to be reasonable.
The Petition also requests
$8,921.05 in litigation costs and $61,702.10 in medical expenses. Thus, Truong
will receive a total net amount of $1,296,043.52. The Petition requests the
funds be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity as outlined in
Attachment 18b(3). Upon review the Court finds the amount awarded to Truong to
be reasonable and finds the disposition of the funds is proper. Accordingly,
Nguyen’s petition is GRANTED.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Nguyen’s
petition is GRANTED.
