TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff South Coast Air Quality Management
District’s Motion for Entry of Stipulated Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is an environmental enforcement action brought by the South Coast Air Quality
Management District (South Coast AQMD). In December 2018, Defendants Ed Hassan
Albadry and Aid Builders, Inc. (Aid Builders) were remodeling a classroom in
Bellflower when an inspector for South Coast AQMD discovered multiple
violations of asbestos regulations.
On
October 27, 2021, South Coast AQMD filed a complaint against Albadry, Aid
Builders, and Does 1-5, alleging the following causes of action: (1) violation
of District Rule 1403(d)(1)(A), (2) violation of District Rule 1403(d)(1)(B),
(3) violation of District Rule 1403(d)(1)(C)(ii)(I), (4) violation of District
Rule 1403(d)(1)(C)(ii)(IV), (5) violation of District Rule 1403(d)(1)(D), (6)
violation of District Rule 1403(d)(1)(E)(i), (7) violation of District Rule
1403(d)(1)(G), (8) violation of District Rule 1403(d)(1)(H), (9) violation of
District Rule 1403(d)(1)(J), (10) violation of District Rule 1403(d)(1)(M), and
(11) violation of District Rule 1403(i).
On
October 10, 2023, the parties stipulated to the dismissal of South Coast AQMD’s
enforcement action.
On February
28, 2024, South Coast AQMD filed the present motion. A hearing on the motion is
set for May 13, 2024.
ANALYSIS
South
Coast AQMD seeks to have judgment entered against Albadry and Aid Builders
pursuant to the parties’ stipulation. For the following reasons, the Court GRANTS
their motion.
Legal
Standard
Code
of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides a summary procedure that enables
courts to enforce a settlement agreement by entering a judgment pursuant to the
terms of the parties’ settlement. In relevant part, it provides as follows:
If
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement
of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment
pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court
may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a).)
A
writing is considered signed if signed by the party or an attorney who
represents the party. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b).)
Discussion
In this case,
South
Coast AQMD
provides a copy of a written settlement agreement signed by Albadry and Aid
Builders on September 7, 2023. (Chavez Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. A.) According to the
agreement, Albadry and Aid Builders agreed to pay South Coast AQMD a total of $32,000 in monthly
payments. (Chavez Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. A, ¶ 2.) If Albadry and Aid Builders
defaulted on the payments, the agreement states the entire amount owed would
become immediately payable as a court judgment. (Chavez Decl., Ex. A, ¶ 6.) South Coast AQMD alleges Albadry and Aid Builders stopped
making monthly payments in November 2023 and now owe an outstanding amount of
$24,000.00. (Chavez Decl., ¶ 10-11.) Thus, the Court finds South Coast AQMD has established the existence of a
settlement agreement. Furthermore, the Court is not in receipt of any
opposition from Albadry and Aid Builders.
Accordingly, South Coast AQMD’s motion is GRANTED.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, the Court
GRANTS South Coast AQMD’s motion to enter
judgment pursuant to their settlement agreement with Albadry and Aid Builders.
