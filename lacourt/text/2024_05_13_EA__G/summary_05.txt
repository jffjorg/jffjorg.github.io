The Judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by Breckenridge Property Fund 2016, LLC (Breckenridge) is sustained with leave to amend. The Judge finds that Breckenridge is a bona fide purchaser and that the Criglers failed to state a claim as a matter of law. The Judge grants Breckenridge's request for judicial notice of certain recorded documents. The Judge concludes that the Criglers' causes of action for quiet title, cancellation of written instrument, declaratory relief, and slander of title fail as a matter of law. The Judge gives the Criglers 20 days to amend their complaint.
