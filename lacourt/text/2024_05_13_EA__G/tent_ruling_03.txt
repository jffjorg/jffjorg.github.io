 Case Number:  23PSCV02985    Hearing Date:   May 13, 2024    Dept:  G Plaintiff Cavalry SPV I, LLC’s Application for Default
Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff Cavalry SPV I, LLC’s Application for Default
Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a collections action. In February 2021, Citibank, N.A. (Citibank) charged
off a credit card account held by Defendant Roman G. Gonzalez with a past-due
balance of $25,696.01. Subsequently, Plaintiff Cavalry SPV I, LLC (Cavalry)
purchased the debt.
On September
27, 2023, Cavalry filed a complaint against Gonzalez and Does 1-100 alleging
the following causes of action: (1) account stated and (2) open book account.
On October 13, 2023, Cavalry’s process server served Gonzalez with substitute
service in La Puente.
After
Gonzalez failed to file an answer, the Court entered default against Gonzalez
on May 2, 2024, and Cavalry submitted the present application for default
judgment.
A
case management conference is set for May 13, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
Cavalry
seeks default judgment against Gonzalez in the total amount of $26,199.51,
including $25,696.01 in damages and $503.50 in costs. Because the Court finds Cavalry
has submitted sufficient evidence, the Court GRANTS Cavalry’s
application for default judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Cavalry’s application for default
judgment is GRANTED.
