As for the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the motion to quash the service of the court order by the Hidden Hills Community Association (HHCA) to Sarah Key. Key argues that the enforcement of the judgment against her is stayed pending appeal and that personal service of the order was required. However, the court finds that the order was properly served on Key's attorney, and Key has received actual notice of the debtor examination. The court also finds that the HHCA complied with the Los Angeles Superior Court (LASC) Rules and that the motion to quash is denied.
