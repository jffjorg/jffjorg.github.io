Sarah Key v. Hidden
Hills Community Association, et al, 21STCP03001 
Tentative decision on motion to quash:  denied



 
 
Petitioner Sarah Key (“Key”) moves to quash the service of a
court order by Respondent Hidden Hills Community Association (“HHCA”).
The court has read and considered the moving papers,
opposition, and reply, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
A. Statement of the Case
1. First Amended Petition 
Petitioner Key commenced this proceeding on September 13,
2021.  The operative pleading is the
First Amended Petition (“FAP”), filed on April 18, 2022, against the HHCA and
Land Mark Electric, Inc. (“Land Mark”) alleging claims for writ of mandate,
declaratory and injunctive relief.  The
FAP alleges in pertinent part as follows. 
Key is the owner of the real property located at 24835
Eldorado Meadow Road, Hidden Hills, California 91302 (“Key Property”) and a
member of the HHCA per Civil Code section 4160. 
FAP ¶5.  The HHCA is a common
interest development subject to the Davis Stirling Common Interest Development
Act (“Davis-Stirling” or the “Act”) under Civil Code section 4800 et seq.  FAP ¶6. 
As such, the HHCA is obligated to maintain and manage common areas and
separate interests that arise out of or related to the common interest
development.  FAP ¶6. 
In July 2021, Land Mark submitted development plans to the HHCA
proposing to cut and fill 1,880 cubic yards of dirt to remove a hill on
property it owns at 5949 Spring Valley Road, Hidden Hills, California 91302
(“Land Mark Property”) and to construct a driveway across the strip of land
owned by Key (“Flag Strip”) without her consent.  FAP ¶13. In January 2022, the HHCA’s
Architectural Committee provided input that it did not like Land Mark’s
plans.  FAP ¶13.  Land Mark has represented in its pleadings
and declarations filed with the court that it plans to build driveways on the Key
Property to obtain access to Eldorado Meadow Road.  FAP ¶14. 
Land Mark has represented to the court that it does not accept that Key
owns the Flag Strip between the Land Mark Property and Eldorado Meadow
Road.  FAP ¶14.  Land Mark has never conceded that there is no
easement that would permit it to build structures and/or driveways on Key’s
land to get to Eldorado Meadow Road.  FAP
¶14. 
The HHCA violated Davis-Stirling and engaged in unlawful
conduct in violation of Civil Code Section 4205 by failing to inform Land Mark,
the owner of the Land Mark Property, that building any driveways or other
structures over the Flag Strip owned by Key to access Eldorado Meadow Road is
trespass in violation of the law and will not be permitted.  FAP ¶11. 
On or around July 27, 2021, and August 6, 2021, Key made
demands for record inspection from the HHCA pursuant to Civil Code Sections
5200-5240 relating to the development project on the Land Mark Property.  FAP ¶20. 
The HHCA failed and refused to provide the records requested.  FAP ¶20. 
On or around August 13, 2021, the HHCA’s General Manager
Cary Brackett sent an email stating that the records requested were in the
google link provided.  FAP ¶20.  None of the documents in the google link
related to the development project proposed for the Land Mark Property.  FAP ¶20. 
The HHCA violated Davis-Stirling and engaged in unlawful
conduct in violation of Civil Code Sections 4925(b) and 5000(b), and the
Governing Documents Bylaws Section 7.8 by failing and refusing to permit Key
and other members of the HHCA to speak at architectural meetings.  FAP ¶¶ 21-22. 
The HHCA violated Davis-Stirling and engaged in unlawful
conduct in violation of Civil Code Section 4360 when it approved Amendments to
the Architectural Standards on October 27, 2021 (the “Amendments”) without
disclosing in writing the “purpose and effect” of the proposed grading
amendment in Section 10(f).  FAP ¶23. 
The Southern California Gas Company (“SoCalGas”) has two
high pressure gas transmission pipelines running directly through the Key
Property and Land Mark Property.  FAP
¶24.  At a meeting on February 16, 2021,
many members of the HHCA reported to the Board of Directors their safety
concerns regarding the SoCalGas pipelines. 
FAP ¶52.  The HHCA’s Board members
voted to obtain experts to do a study independent of SoCalGas regarding the
public safety issues surrounding the two high pressure gas transmission.  FAP ¶53. 
Key provided the HHCA Board with a list of three independent
high-pressure gas transmission pipeline experts with their resumes.  FAP ¶53. 
On March 15, 2021, Key also provided the HHCA Board with more than ten
pages of safety and safety related issues pertaining to the SoCalGas
pipelines.  FAP ¶53.  On March 16, 2021, the HHCA Board announced
at a meeting, without notice to the members and without an agenda item, that it
would not address any of the safety issues that it had begun investigating
relating to the SoCalGas pipelines.  FAP
¶54. 
In 2021, SoCalGas sent Key a safety notice stating that it
needed clear access to the high-pressure lines to inspect, maintain, repair,
and/or replace the pipelines.  FAP
¶59.  Land Mark obtained a letter from
SoCalGas regarding the safety protocols that must be followed with respect to
what development may be permitted in the vicinity of the SoCalGas
pipelines.  FAP ¶62.  The HHCA’s Architectural Committee moved
forward with the plans to develop the Land Mark Property.  FAP ¶62. 

Petitioner Key seeks a writ of mandamus and declaratory
relief commanding the HHCA, its Board of Directors, and its Architectural
Committee to (1) mandate that Architectural Standards require a permit
applicant to obtain a variance to excavate the hills and basements at Hidden
Hills; (2) refrain from declaring that a variance is not necessary for the
proposed development at the Land Mark Property to excavate, compact, and grade;
(3) observe the safety requirements set forth in the SoCalGas’ safety notice regarding
high pressure gas transmission pipelines and to comply with the safety
protocols of SoCalGas for any development at the Land Mark Property; (4) comply
with Civil Code Sections 4925(b) and 5000(b) and the Governing Documents Bylaws
Section 7.8 permitting Key and other members of the HHCA to speak for a
reasonable time at any meeting of the Architectural Committee; (5) comply with
the HHCA’s February 16, 2021 meeting minutes; (6) determine that the Amendments
are illegal; (7) and declare that Key owns the Flag Strip that borders the Land
Mark Property.  FAP at 24-25. 
Petitioner Key also seeks declaratory and injunctive relief
against Land Mark that (1) declares Key owns the Flag Strip, (2) there is no
easement of any kind permitting Land Mark to build driveways or any other
structures across the Flag Strip owned by Key, (3) declares the non-exclusive
road easement is to the Hidden Hills Corporation, not the HHCA, (4) Land Mark
cannot traverse or build on the Flag Strip owned by Key without her prior
written permission, (5) Land Mark does not have permission to traverse or build
on the Flag Strip, and (6) Land Mark be ordered to remove its fencing from the
Key Property.  FAP at 25-26.
 
2. Course of
Proceedings
            On
September 21, 2021, Petitioner filed a Petition for writ of mandate,
declaratory and injunctive relief.
On April 14, 2022, the Court granted a motion to compel
arbitration brought by Respondent. 
            On
April 18, 2022, Petitioner filed the FAP.
On December 14, 2023, an arbitrator awarded Respondent
$254,815.53 in attorneys’ fees and costs.
On May 14, 2024, the court entered a Judgment on the award
for $278,606.81
On June 18, 2024, Petitioner filed a Notice of Appeal from
the judgment.
On September 24, 2024, the court denied Petitioner’s motion
to stay enforcement of the judgment pending her appeal.
 
B. Applicable Law
            "The
judgment creditor may apply to the proper court for an order requiring the
judgment debtor to appear before the court, or before a referee appointed by
the court, at a time and place specified in the order, to furnish information
to aid in enforcement of the money judgment." CCP § 708.110(a).
"The judgment creditor shall personally serve a copy of
the order on the judgment debtor not less than 30 days before the date set for
the examination.  Service shall be made
in the manner specified in Section 415.10."  CCP §708.110(d).[1]
A summons may be served by personal delivery of a copy of
the summons and complaint to the person to be served.  CCP §415.10. 
Under the Enforcement of Judgments Law, where a provision of
law provides for personal service, “service shall be made in the same manner as
a summons is served under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 413.10) of Title
5.”  CCP §684.110(a)(1).  
LASC Rule 3.22l(a)(4) provides: "The application and
order must be filed in the district in which the judgment was entered. If the
courthouse where judgment was entered provides for judgment debtor's
proceedings, the application for a debtor's proceeding must be filed in that
courthouse. If not, the application must be filed in the courthouse where the
district's supervising judge is located." 
LASC Rule 3.221(b)(1) states: "proof of service of an
order issued pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 708.110, 708.120, or
708.130 must be filed directly with the clerk in the assigned department no
later than 4:00p.m., three court days before the hearing date, unless otherwise
ordered by the court and that "Failure to file proof of service will
result in the proceeding being taken off calendar without costs awarded to the
applicant. No further hearing will be scheduled earlier than 120 days from the
date of the originally scheduled hearing, except for good cause shown in a
written declaration."
A defendant may serve and file a notice of motion to quash
service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him
or her.  CCP §418.10(a)(1).  The rationale behind this statute is
that compliance with the statutory procedures for service of process are
essential to establish personal jurisdiction.  See Rockefeller
Technology Investments (Asia) VII v. Changzhou Sinotype Technology Co., Ltd.,¿(2018)
24 Cal.App.5th 115, 133.  Failure to conform to statutory requirements
means that all that follows is void.  Honda Motor Co. v. Superior Court,¿(1992)
10 Cal.App.4th 1043, 1048. 
In a motion to quash, the defendant is the moving party and
must present some admissible evidence (declarations or affidavits) to place the
issue before the court.  However, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff
to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, valid service of process in
conformance with this state’s service statutes.  See School
Dist. of Okaloosa County v. Superior Court,¿(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1126,
1131.

            2.
The HHCA’s Evidence
            On
May 14, 2024, the court entered a minute order stating that “the remaining
claim against Land Mark Electric, Inc. is ordered transferred to Department 1
for reassignment to an I/C court.” Minute Order, p. 2. 
On May 17, 2024, Department 1 entered an order reassigning
the entire case for all purposes to an independent calendar court in Van Nuys.  Minute Order (“The case is ordered transferred
to Judge Virginia Keeny in Department W at the Van Nuys Courthouse East for
reassignment purposes only. All future proceedings will be before a Judge
selected by the Supervising Judge sitting in Department W.”). 
On May 21, 2024, Judge Keeny (Dept. W) assigned the case for
all purposes to Judge Harmon (Dept. 107).  Minute Order (“By order of the Supervising
Judge, the above-entitled action is now and shall be reassigned to Judge Eric
P. Harmon in Department 107, Van Nuys Courthouse West as an Individual Calendar
(IC), direct calendaring judge for all purposes, including trial.”). 
Since May 21, 2024, the court’s website has treated the case
as reassigned to Judge Harmon for all purposes. Hearing reservations through
the court’s reservation system, including reservations for debtor examinations,
cannot be procured from Department 85.  White
Decl., ¶¶ 5-6, Exs. D-E. 
On May 31, 2024, White’s office reserved a debtor exam
through the court reservation system in the same manner that it would in any
other case.  White Decl., ¶6.  There was no ability to reserve a debtor exam
in Department 85.  White Decl., ¶6.  Because the case had been reassigned to
Department 107 for all purposes, the HHCA’s counsel believed it would have been
inappropriate to do so anyway.  White
Decl., ¶6.  
On June 5, 2024, Judge Harmon signed an order for Key to
appear at a judgment debtor examination, which was continued to August 23, 2024
on Judge Harmon’s own motion because his department was dark on the original
date. 
On July 8, 2024, Key’s attorney wrote to counsel for the
HHCA, expressing her position that enforcement of the Judgment was stayed
pending appeal without the need for posting an undertaking, and threatening a
motion if the HHCA did not agree to withdraw a bank levy.  White Decl., ¶2, Ex. A.  The HHCA did not agree and invited Key to file
her motion. 
Over the next three weeks, the HHCA sent several
communications asking Key to obtain a hearing date on her motion before the
debtor examination so that her contention that enforcement was stayed could be
resolved before the examination.  White
Decl., ¶3, Ex. B. 
On July 23, 2024, Key’s attorney accepted service of the
order for her to appear at her examination on August 23, 2024, subject to his
reservation of rights and position that enforcement was stayed.  White Decl., Ex. B. 
On August 2, 2024, the court heard and denied on the merits
Key’s ex parte application for a stay of enforcement. At the hearing, counsel
for the HHCA raised the specter of disruptive administrative issues if the case
remained pending in two different courthouses. The court indicated that it
would continue to hear post-judgment motions but that the August 23, 2024
debtor examination could go forward in Department 107 in Van Nuys.  Minute Order; Notice of Ruling.
On August 7, 2024, Key unsuccessfully applied ex parte for
reconsideration of the court’s August 2, 2024 order. 
On August 12, 2024, Key served a noticed motion to stay
enforcement and reconsider the court’s August 2, 2024 order. The motion was
apparently rejected by the clerk’s office because Key did not reserve a date
through the Court Reservation System and the clerk believed it was filed in the
wrong department. It was later filed again and processed by the clerk on August
26, 2024. 
On August 13, 2024, Key’s counsel requested a continuance of
the debtor examination pending a resolution of her motion for a stay and stated
that Key would file an application or motion to continue the exam if the HHCA
did not agree.  The HHCA declined to grant
this continuance because Key’s contention that enforcement was stayed had
already been resolved on the merits. White Decl., ¶4, Ex. C. 
On August 19, 2024, the HHCA requested confirmation that Key
would appear at her examination on August 23, 2024.   White Decl., Ex. C.
On August 21, 2024, Key filed a motion to quash the application
and order for appearance at a judgment debtor examination and her counsel
indicated that she did not intend to appear at her examination. The motion to
quash argued that “any proceeding relating to the Judgment, including but not
limited to the Judgment Debtor Exam, must be in Department 85.” It also argued
that enforcement was stayed. 
On August 23, 2024, Key’s counsel appeared at the
examination hearing, but she did not. After determining that the order for her
appearance was validly issued and properly served, Judge Harmon issued a bench
warrant for her arrest, which he then held.  Key was ordered to appear for her examination on
September 24, 2024 in Department 85.  
On September 19, 2024, Key withdrew her original motion to
quash. On September 20, 2024, Key filed a new motion to quash with new
contentions and set it for hearing on October 22, 2024. 
On September 24, 2024, Department 85 denied Key’s motion to
stay enforcement.  The HHCA was present
with a court reporter and ready to proceed with the debtor examination after
the hearing.  However, the court
indicated that it would not require the examination to proceed with the motion
to quash pending. The examination was continued to October 22, 2024, and Key
was ordered to personally appear on that date.

Reply Evidence 
            The
Notice and Acknowledgement of Receipt signed by Key’s attorney was filed on
July 25, 2024.  Hanley Supp. Decl., ¶2,
Ex. 6.  
The HHCA’s application and order for appearance was set for
a hearing in Department 107 of the Van Nuys Courthouse West.  Hanley Supp. Decl., ¶3, Ex. 7.  Department 107 continued the hearing to August
23, 2024.  Hanley Supp. Decl., ¶3, Ex. 8.  
 
            D.
Analysis 
            Key
moves to quash the HHCA’s application and order for her debtor exam.  
First, Key contends that the enforcement of the Judgment
against her is stayed by her appeal.  Mot. at 6. 
The court ruled against her on this issue on September 24, 2024.  
Second, Key argues that personal service of the order was
required by CCP section 708.110(d), which requires personal service of the
order on the judgment debtor is required in the manner specified in Section
415.10."  CCP §708.110(d).  In turn, CCP section 415.10 requires summons
to be served by personal delivery of a copy of the summons and complaint to the
person to be served.  CCP §415.10.  Yet, the HHCA only served her through Notice
and Acknowledgement signed by her attorney, not her personally.  Mot. at 7; Reply at 3-4.
The HHCA relies on the Enforcement of Judgments Law which
provides that, where a provision of law provides for personal service, “service
shall be made in the same manner as a summons is served under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 413.10) of Title 5.” 
CCP §684.110(a)(1).  The HHCA
served Key by Notice and Acknowledgement pursuant to CCP section 415.30.  Opp. at 6-7.
Key replies that CCP section 684.020, which provides that,
except for an inapplicable exception in subdivision (b), when an order is
required to be served under this title on the judgment debtor, it shall be
served on the judgment debtor instead of the attorney for the judgment
debtor.  CCP §684.020(a).  Notice and acknowledgement does not satisfy
either CCP section 708.110(d) or CCP section 684.020(a).  Moreover, CCP section 684.030 states that CCP
section 684.010 and 684.020 do not apply to (a) a subpoena or other process to
require the attendance of a party and (b) a paper to bring a party into
contempt.  Reply at 3.  
Key is correct that CCP section 684.020 – which is in Enforcement
of Judgments Chapter 4, Article 1 (Service on Attorney of Creditor or Debtor)
--- requires service of writs, notices, and other papers on the judgment debtor
instead of the attorney for the judgment debtor absent specific circumstances
showing that service on the attorney is appropriate.  CCP §684.020(a).  CCP section 684.030 also states that CCP
section 684.020 does not apply to service of process to require the attendance
of a party.  
The HHCA’s reliance on CCP section 684.110(a)(1) therefore
is misplaced.  It provides that the
manner of service of legal process under the Enforcement of Judgments Law shall
be made in the manner of serving summons in CCP section 413.10.  CCP section 684.110(a)(1) does not provide
the identity of the person to be served, which is the debtor and not the
debtor’s attorney.  Moreover, personal
service of the order on the judgment debtor is required.  CCP §708.110(d).  Plainly, personal service is required to ensure
jurisdiction for contempt purposes.
Nonetheless, Key’s motion is not well-taken.  On August 23, 2024, after determining that
the order for her appearance was validly issued and properly served, Judge
Harmon issued a bench warrant for Key’s arrest, which he held.  Key was ordered to appear for her examination
on September 24, 2024 in Department 85. 
Key personally appeared in Department 85 on September 24, 2024.  On that date, Department 85 denied Key’s
motion to stay enforcement and continued Key’s examination to October 22, 2024,
and Key was ordered to personally appear on that date.  
Thus, although the order were not personally served on Key,
the court has personal jurisdiction over her, and she has received actual
notice, for purposes of the debtor examination. 
Her attorney also received notice of the examination.  No more is required, and there is no need to
personally serve Key with the exam order. 
The law does not require idle acts. 
Civil Code §3532.
Key also argues that LASC Rule 3.22l(a)(4) requires the application
and order to be filed in the district in which the judgment was entered.  LASC Rule 3.221(b)(1) requires proof of
service of the order to be filed directly with the clerk in the assigned
department no later than 4:00p.m., three court days before the hearing date,
unless otherwise ordered by the court. 
“Failure to file proof of service will result in the proceeding being
taken off calendar without costs awarded to the applicant. No further hearing
will be scheduled earlier than 120 days from the date of the originally
scheduled hearing, except for good cause shown in a written declaration."  Id.
Key argues that the HHCA was required to file the
application and order, and a proof of service three court days before the
hearing, in Department 85.   Mot. at 5. 

The HHCA explains that the court’s electronic filing system
directed it to file in Van Nuys where the remaining case was assigned. See LASC
Rule 3.3(i) (the assigned judge hears all matters).  Rules that do not provide any consequence for
non-compliance such as LASC Rule 3.221, are considered directory, not
mandatory. In re Miguel E., (2004) 12 Cal.App.4th 521,
524.  Opp. at 8-9.
The court agrees.  There
was initial confusion whether Department 107 or Department 85 should handle the
judgment debtor exam. See August 23, 2024 Department 107.  The HHCA’s application and order complied
with LASC Rule 3.221 for hearing in Department 107.  The confusion has been resolved with
Department 85 agreeing to handle the judgment debtor exam and hear the instant
motion. September 24, 2024 Department 85 minute order.  The HHCA complied with LASC Rule 3.221, which
exists for the benefit of the court, not the parties.
The motion to quash is denied.
