And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that Burlington Convalescent Hospital, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration of Wol H. Ahn's claims is denied. The judge found that the Arbitration Agreement is unenforceable against Wol because she did not sign it herself, and Sun Hee Ahn, who signed the agreement, lacked authority to do so. The judge rejected Burlington's arguments that Sun Hee had authority to sign the agreement based on a document styled "Statement of Authority to Act on Behalf of Resident" and a POLST (Physicians Orders For Life Sustaining Treatment) form. The judge also denied Burlington's corresponding motion to stay proceedings in this Court pending resolution of the arbitration.
