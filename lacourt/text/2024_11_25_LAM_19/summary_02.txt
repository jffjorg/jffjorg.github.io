And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition for approval of the transfer of payment rights and has decided to continue the hearing to February 14, 2025. This decision was made because a notice of related case was filed in two other cases, seeking to relate those cases with the current case and with each other. However, the notice of related case was not filed in the current case as required by California law. The court is giving Department B the opportunity to rule on the notice of related case, and is ordering the counsel for the petitioner to file the notice of related case in the current action within 5 court days. The court has also set a non-appearance case review for December 13, 2024, to discuss the notice of related case.
