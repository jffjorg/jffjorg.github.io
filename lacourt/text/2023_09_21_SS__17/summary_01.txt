And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Raul Tamayo, is seeking leave to file a first amended complaint (FAC) to add two new causes of action against the defendants, Bob's Hand Car Wash, Inc., Carmen Sanchez, and Ricardo Sanchez. The original complaint alleged failure to pay minimum wages, overtime wages, meal periods, and rest periods. The new causes of action seek damages for failure to pay earned wages at termination and for violation of Business & Professions Code section 17200.

The court finds that there is no evidence of meaningful prejudice to the defendants, such as the running of the statute of limitations, trial delay, loss of critical evidence, or added preparation costs. Therefore, the court grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a FAC.

The judge found that these additions are based on the same facts as the original complaint and wouldn't cause undue prejudice to the defendants.  The trial, currently set for June 17, 2024, will likely proceed as scheduled.

**Case Number:** 22STCV36361

**Plaintiff:** Raul Tamayo

**Defendant:** Bob’s Hand Car Wash, Inc., Carmen Sanchez, Ricardo Sanchez

**Date:** September 21, 2023

**Department:** 17, Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles

---

In this case, Plaintiff Raul Tamayo filed a complaint against Defendants Bob’s Hand Car Wash, Inc., Carmen Sanchez, and Ricardo Sanchez for:

1. Failure to pay minimum wages
2. Failure to pay overtime wages
3. Failure to provide meal periods and pay period wages
4. Failure to provide rest periods and pay rest period wages
5. Failure to furnish accurate itemized wage statements

Plaintiff now moves for leave to amend the complaint to add:

1. A sixth cause of action for failure to pay earned wages at termination (Labor Code sections 201-203) based on Defendants’ representations in discovery that Plaintiff’s employment with them ended in May 2022.
2. A seventh cause of action for violation of Business & Professions Code section 17200, inadvertently left out of the original complaint.

The court grants Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file a first amended complaint (FAC) as it does not cause meaningful prejudice to Defendants and falls under the liberal interpretation of the courts for amendments in furtherance of justice. The new FAC is based on the same set of facts, and the trial is not delayed (set for 6/17/2024).

**Judge’s Significant Statements:**

> The policy favoring leave to amend is so strong that it is an abuse of discretion to deny an amendment unless the adverse party can show meaningful prejudice, such as the running of the statute of limitations, trial delay, the loss of critical evidence, or added preparation costs.

> Here, there is no evidence that Defendant will suffer meaningful prejudice in the form of “the running of the statute of limitations, trial delay, the loss of critical evidence, or added preparation costs.”
