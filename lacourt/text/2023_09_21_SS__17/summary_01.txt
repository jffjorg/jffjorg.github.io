And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint (FAC). The plaintiff seeks to add two new causes of action to the original complaint: a sixth cause of action for failure to pay earned wages at termination in violation of Labor Code sections 201-203, and a seventh cause of action for violation of Business & Professions Code section 17200. The judge finds that the proposed amendment is based on the same set of facts as the original complaint and will not cause undue delay or prejudice to the defendant. The judge notes that the policy favoring leave to amend is strong and that it is an abuse of discretion to deny an amendment unless the adverse party can show meaningful prejudice. In this case, the defendant has not shown any meaningful prejudice and the proposed amendment is granted.
