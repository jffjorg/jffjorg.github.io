 Case No.:

 Hearing
  Date:  September 21, 2023



 
Plaintiff’s
motion for leave to file a FAC is GRANTED. 
 
            On
11/17/2021, Plaintiff filed suit against Defendants Bob’s Hand Car Wash, Inc.,
Carmen Sanchez, and Ricardo Sanchez, alleging: (1) failure to pay minimum
wages; (2) failure to pay overtime wages; (3) failure to provide meal periods
and pay period wages; (4) failure to provide rest periods and pay rest period
wages; and (5) failure to furnish accurate itemized wage statements.
 
            Now,
Plaintiff moves for leave to amend to file a first amended complaint (FAC).
 
Discussion  
 
            Plaintiff
seeks leave to amend to add: (1) a sixth cause of action for failure to pay
earned wages at termination in violation of Labor Code sections 201-203 based
on Defendants’ representations in discovery that Plaintiff’s employment with
them ended in May 2022; and (2) a seventh cause of action for violation of
Business & Professions Code section 17200 on the grounds that Plaintiff’s
counsel just realized on July 18, 2023 that this cause of action was
inadvertently left out of Plaintiff’s original complaint. Plaintiff argues that
this cause of action extends the statute of limitations for minimum wage,
overtime and meal and rest period claims from three years to four years, citing
Cortez v. Purolator Air Filtration Products Do. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 163.) 
 
            Plaintiff
contends that “[b]oth proposed causes of action relate back to the original
complaint because they are (1) based on the same set of facts alleged in the
original complaint; (2) seek recovery against the same defendants; and (3)
refer to the “same incident” of unpaid wages and unprovided meal and rest
periods.” (Motion, 2: 15-16.) 
 
“This statutory provision giving the
courts the power to permit amendments in furtherance of justice has received a
very liberal interpretation by the courts of this state.” (Klopstock v.
Superior Court (1941) Cal.2d 13, 19. The policy favoring leave to
amend is so strong that it is an abuse of discretion to deny an amendment
unless the adverse party can show meaningful prejudice, such as the running of
the statute of limitations, trial delay, the loss of critical evidence, or
added preparation costs.  (Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003)
109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761. 
 
Here, there is no evidence that Defendant will suffer
meaningful prejudice in the form of “the
running of the statute of limitations, trial delay, the loss of critical
evidence, or added preparation costs.” (Atkinson, supra, 109
Cal.App.4th at p. 761.) As noted by Plaintiff, the proposed FAC is based on the
same set of facts set forth in the original complaint, no depositions have
taken place, and will not require a delay of trial, which is currently set for
6/17/2024.
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
motion for leave to file a FAC is granted. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
