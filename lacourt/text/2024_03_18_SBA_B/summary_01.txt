And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case between Zula Tucker Living Trust (plaintiff) and County of Los Angeles et al. (defendants). The case involves a breach of contract claim, with the plaintiff alleging that the defendants illegally assessed and/or levied on the plaintiff's property in disregard of Proposition 13 and Revenue & Tax Code. The defendants demurred to the First Cause of Action for breach of contract, arguing that the plaintiff failed to allege exhaustion of the statutorily prescribed administrative remedy and that a cause of action for breach of contract is barred by law. The court agrees with the defendants and sustains the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff will not be able to revise its complaint to address the issues raised by the defendants.
