And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of LONNIE LEE GIPSON, et al. vs. TORRANCE CARE CENTER WEST, INC. (Case No. 23TCV01856). The defendant, Torrance Care Center West, Inc., has filed a demurrer to the first, second, and fourth causes of action in the complaint, and has also filed a motion to strike certain allegations in the complaint.

The court has sustained the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiffs have 20 days to revise and re-file the allegations in the first, second, and fourth causes of action. The court has also denied the motion to strike, as the allegations in the complaint are sufficient to support the causes of action.

The court has also denied a motion by the attorney for the plaintiffs, Leslie A. Blozan, Esq., to be relieved as counsel. The court has ruled that there is no proof of service of the motion, and therefore the motion is denied without prejudice.

The court has ordered the defendant to give notice of the ruling.
