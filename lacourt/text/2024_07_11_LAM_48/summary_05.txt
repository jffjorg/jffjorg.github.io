And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the motion for order of appointment of successor-in-interest filed by Amanda Grabowski, who claims to be the successor-in-interest of the deceased plaintiff, Blake Grabowski. The motion was filed in Case No. 24STCV02961, but the hearing reservation was made in Case No. 24STCV02800. The court ordered that all future documents and hearing reservations must be filed in Case No. 24STCV02800 or else the court will strike the filings or take the motions off calendar.

The court finds that the motion does not comply with the requirements for substituting a successor-in-interest in this case under California law. Specifically, the motion does not provide a copy of the final order showing the distribution of the decedent's cause of action to the successor-in-interest, and the declarations do not establish who has inherited the plaintiff's claims in this action.

The court also notes that the law of the domicile controls the disposition of a decedent's intangible personal property, and since Blake Grabowski died in Michigan, Michigan law applies. However, the motion cites no Michigan law about intestate succession and who is the rightful heir under Michigan law.

The court denies the motion without prejudice and orders the moving party to give notice. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit. If all parties in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the court are required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference) is also on calendar.
