[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR ORDER
  FOR RELIEF FROM WAIVER OF EXPERT WITNESSES 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
July 11, 2024



 
On September 15, 2020, Plaintiffs
16220 Linda Terrace LLC and Scott A. Moore filed this action against Defendants
Ha Tikva Management LLC and Eugene Rapaport.
On
January 17, 2023, the parties exchanged expert witness information.  (Kalter Decl. ¶ 2.)
When
Defendants’ current handling attorney took over this case, he discovered that a
withdrawal of expert witnesses was inadvertently served on Plaintiffs.  (Kalter Decl. ¶¶ 3-4.)  On August 11, 2023 and September 7, 2023, Defendants’
counsel informed Plaintiffs’ counsel about the inadvertent disclosure.  (Kalter Decl. ¶¶ 4, 6.)  Defendants’ counsel has never received any request
to depose Defendants’ expert witnesses.  (Kalter
Decl. ¶ 7.)  Defendants’ counsel attempted
to get a stipulation for relief from waiver, but Plaintiffs did not agree.  (Kalter Decl. ¶¶ 8-9.)
On
June 12, 2024, Defendants filed a motion for relief from waiver of expert witnesses.  Plaintiffs did not file any oppositions.
“On
motion of any party who has failed to submit expert witness information on the date
specified in a demand for that exchange, the court may grant leave to submit that
information on a later date.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2034.710.)
Defendants
provided their expert witness information on January 17, 2023, for experts
Sergey Shvartsman and Tatyana Skevin.  Defendants
discovered the erroneous withdrawal by August 11, 2023 and notified Plaintiffs.  Trial is not until October 28, 2024, and there
is sufficient time for Plaintiffs to depose Defendants’ experts.  No prejudice is shown.
Accordingly,
the unopposed Motion for Order for Relief from Waiver of Expert Witnesses is GRANTED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
