And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the unopposed motion for relief from waiver of expert witnesses filed by HA TIKVA MANAGEMENT LLC and Eugene Rapaport. The motion was filed in response to an inadvertent disclosure of expert witness withdrawal, which was discovered by the defendants' counsel in August 2023. Despite the defendants' counsel's attempts to get a stipulation for relief from waiver, the plaintiffs did not agree. The judge notes that the parties exchanged expert witness information on January 17, 2023, and trial is not until October 28, 2024, leaving sufficient time for the plaintiffs to depose the defendants' experts. Therefore, the judge has granted the motion, allowing the defendants to provide their expert witness information on a later date.
