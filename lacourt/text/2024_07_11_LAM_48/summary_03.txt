And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to seal the record in the case of CASA MEXICO ENTERPRISES, LLC v. ERIC GERARDO LEYVA-BUCCIO, et al. The motion was filed by Cross-Defendant Oscar de la Hoya, who sought to seal the record due to the presence of highly personal and confidential information, including descriptions of sexual activity, sexual encounters, and physical health.

The Judge found that there was an overriding interest that overcame the right of public access to the record, and that the request was narrowly tailored to only redact the necessary portions of the exhibits and brief. The Judge also found that a substantial probability existed that the overriding interest would be prejudiced absent sealing.

The motion to seal the record is granted, and the moving party is required to give notice. Parties who intend to submit on the tentative ruling must send an email to the Court indicating their intention to submit.
