The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion for new trial. The plaintiff, Jennifer Bornoff, filed a motion for new trial after the court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff argued that the court abused its discretion by denying her due process and that she suffered economic harm as a result of the defendant's delay in claims payment. However, the court found that the plaintiff failed to provide evidence of economic harm and that the issue of detriment was fully on notice. The court also noted that the plaintiff admitted that all benefits under the policy were paid and that the defendant paid all benefits owed to the plaintiff. Therefore, the court denied the motion for new trial.
