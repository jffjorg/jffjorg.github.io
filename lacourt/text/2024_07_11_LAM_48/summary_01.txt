And here is the summary in English:

This is a tentative ruling in a civil case between Jane Doe L.P. and Downey Unified School District. The case involves a dispute over the scope of a request for production of documents (RFP) related to a student named K.G. The RFP was served on December 11, 2023, and the defendant failed to respond to it. The plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses, which was heard on March 19, 2024. The court found that some information about K.G. was relevant, but the RFP was overbroad and infringed on K.G.'s privacy rights. The court ordered the parties to meet and confer about the scope of the RFP and ordered the defendant to provide K.G.'s guardian's contact information to the plaintiff. The parties have been discussing the scope of the RFP since then. The defendant has now limited its proposal to produce documents related to K.G.'s student profile, IEP, and discipline history. The court finds that this is too narrow and orders the defendant to produce additional documents, including behavioral and psychosocial reports and disciplinary records. The court grants the motion to compel further responses in part.
