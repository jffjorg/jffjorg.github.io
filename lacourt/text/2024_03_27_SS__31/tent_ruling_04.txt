LEGAL STANDARD An out-of-state lawyer, not admitted to practice in California, may be admitted pro hac vice—i.e., to appear and take part in a particular action only. Applications for such admission are generally heard as law and motion matters. (CRC Rule 9.40.) To be eligible for admission pro hac vice: (1) the applicant must be admitted to practice before a U.S. court, or the highest court of any state or territory; (2) he or she must not be a California resident, nor regularly engaged in practice or other business here; and (3) a member of the California Bar must be associated as attorney of record in the case. (CRC Rule 9.40(a).) A verified application must be filed stating (1) the applicant's residence and office addresses; (2) the court or courts in which he or she is admitted to practice and the dates of admission; (3) that he or she is currently in good standing in such courts; (4) that he or she has not been suspended or disbarred in any court; (5) the title and case number of any California action in which he or she has applied to appear pro hac vice during the preceding two years, the date of each application, and whether or not it was granted; and (6) the name, address and telephone number of the active member of the State Bar who is attorney of record. (CRC Rule 9.40(d)—filing fee must accompany application.)   Copies of the application must be served by mail upon all parties who have appeared in the action, and also upon the State Bar at its San Francisco office at least 16 court days before the hearing (notice governed by CCP § 1005).  A fee (currently $50) must be paid to the State Bar.  (CRC Rule 9.40.)    III. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION The applicant establishes that he is licensed in the State of Texas, and is in good standing. Applicant has not been admitted pro hac vice in the State of California in the last two years. Applicant declares he is not a California resident and does not regularly work in California.  Licensed California attorney, James F. Kuhne, Jr., is associated as counsel in this case. Counsel of record tendered payment to the State Bar. (Kuhne Decl. ¶ 3.) Further, Counsel declares that a copy of the application and moving papers were uploaded to the State Bar of California’s portal for pro hac vice admissions.
