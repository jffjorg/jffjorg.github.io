Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the cross-complaint and the motion to strike. The case involves a trip and fall accident in a parking lot, and multiple parties have filed cross-complaints against each other. The court has ruled that the amended cross-complaint filed by BH50 is untimely and should be stricken. The court has also granted the motion to strike the amended cross-complaint, but will delay its ruling on the December 13, 2023 cross-complaint until the hearing. The court has ordered the parties to meet and confer to try to reach an agreement before the hearing, and has also ordered that the motion to strike be heard simultaneously with the demurrer.
