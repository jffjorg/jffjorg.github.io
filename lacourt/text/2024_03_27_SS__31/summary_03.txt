And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Michelle Kim in the case of Cebert Green vs. Kameron Lee Kai and Geoffrey Kai (Case No. 21STCV21475). The defendants have moved for an order requiring the plaintiff to post an undertaking in the sum of $100,000, citing CCP § 1030. The plaintiff opposes the motion. The judge has denied the motion, finding that the defendants have failed to provide adequate grounds for an undertaking. The defendants' motion lacks substantial evidence to support a reasonable possibility of prevailing on the merits at trial, and their affidavit fails to substantiate the amount of costs and attorney fees expected to incur. The judge has ordered the moving party to give notice, and parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement.
