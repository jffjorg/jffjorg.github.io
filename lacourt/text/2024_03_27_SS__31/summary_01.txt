Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying without prejudice a motion to compel compliance with subpoenas served on BioHealth Pain Management. The motion was filed by defendants George Anderson and Karo Vartanian, who are seeking the production of business records and sanctions. The judge found that the defendants had not resolved the procedural issue of service, specifically that BioHealth was not properly served with the moving papers. The judge ordered the moving party to give notice and encouraged the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
