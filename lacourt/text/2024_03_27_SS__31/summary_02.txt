And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel filed by Plaintiff Vincent Rossiello. The motion was brought because Defendant Brian Sanchez Rojas failed to serve responses to the request for production of documents (RPDs) served on March 22, 2023. However, the Court finds that the motion is MOOT because Defendant did serve responses on February 1, 2024, prior to the hearing.

The Court also awards sanctions to Plaintiff in the amount of $250 for having to bring the motion, and one motion filing fee of $60 as costs. The Court orders Defendant and his attorney to pay sanctions to Plaintiff in the total amount of $310 within 20 days.

The Court notes that the parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the case number and other required information. If the parties do not submit or appear at the hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.
