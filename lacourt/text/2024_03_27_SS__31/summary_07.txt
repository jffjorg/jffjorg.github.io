And here is the English-text summary:

**Tentative Ruling**

The court excuses the personal appearance of Claimant Luis Mejia and the guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call. The petition to approve the compromise of pending action of a minor is denied due to several defects. Claimant, an adult person with a disability, did not sign the petition, and the attorney's declaration does not justify the request for 40% of Claimant's proceeds. Additionally, a written attorney fee agreement was not provided, and the reasons for the apportionment of settlement payments between Claimant and other plaintiffs were not specified. The petitioner must file a new petition curing these defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.
