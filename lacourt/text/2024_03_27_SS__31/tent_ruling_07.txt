 Case Number:  BC705881    Hearing Date:   March 27, 2024    Dept:  31 DEPT:  31 HEARING DATE: 03/27/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER: BC705881 LUIS MEJIA ET AL VS SEBASTIAN JOSEPHRAJ, ROMAN CATHOLIC ARCHBISHOP OF LOS ANGELES PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE OF PENDING ACTION OF A MINOR Luis Mejia, Age 38 RECOMMENDATION: Deny.  TENTATIVE¿ ¿ The Court excuses the personal appearance of Claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.¿  Plaintiffs have agreed to settle their claims against Defendants for the total amount of $550,000, with $250,000 being apportioned to Luis Mejia (“Claimant”). If the settlement is approved, $70,599.32 will be used for medical expenses, $100,000 for attorneys’ fees, and $26,895.57 will be used for costs.  The net balance of $52,505.11 will be delivered directly to Claimant, an adult person with a disability.  The petition filed on February 29, 2024 is denied for the following reasons:  Claimant is an adult person with a disability and who has capacity, and he is therefore required to sign Item 21 on MC-350 regarding consent. Claimant did not sign the petition.  Petitioner requests 40% of Claimant’s proceeds to be used for attorney’s fees. Item 13a requires a declaration from the attorney explaining the basis for the request, including a discussion of the applicable factors listed in rule 7.955(b) of the Cal. Rules of Court. The attorney declaration does not satisfy this requirement to justify 40% of Claimant’s proceeds. Further, a copy of the written attorney fee agreement was not provided as Attachment 17a.   Lastly, the reasons for the apportionment of the settlement payments between the Claimant and each other Plaintiff must be specified in Attachment 11b(6). ¿ Petitioner must reserve a new date and file a new petition curing the above-noted defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.  Moving party is ordered to give notice.
