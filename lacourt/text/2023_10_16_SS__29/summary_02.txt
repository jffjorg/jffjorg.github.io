And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to vacate an arbitration award. The plaintiff had argued that the arbitrator's award was terse and short on explanation, and that the arbitrator had refused to hear evidence material to the controversy. The plaintiff also argued that the arbitrator had exceeded his powers by refusing to comply with the requirements of the arbitration agreement. However, the judge found that the arbitrator had considered all of the evidence presented by both sides and had made a reasonable decision based on that evidence. The judge also found that the arbitrator had referred to the evidence that indicated that no triable issue existed, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (g). Therefore, the judge denied the plaintiff's motion to vacate the arbitration award.
