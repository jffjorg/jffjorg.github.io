Summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash the deposition subpoenas issued to SSA, EDD, and CMS. The motion to quash the subpoenas issued to SSA and EDD is denied as moot because those entities have stated that they will not comply with the subpoenas. The Court grants in part and denies in part the motion to quash the subpoena issued to CMS, modifying the subpoena to limit it to records relating to injuries or treatments relating to Boren's neck, back, and spine for the time period of December 22, 2012, to the present. The Court also grants Boren's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,260, finding that the defendants acted oppressively and without substantial justification in opposing the motion.
