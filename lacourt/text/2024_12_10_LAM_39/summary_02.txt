And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to quash a subpoena served on H. Troy Farahmand, an attorney who is a member of defendants S.S.L. Investments, LLC and 9419 Mason Partners, LLC. The subpoena seeks attorney-client privileged documents, but the judge finds that Farahmand was not acting as defendants' attorney and that the documents sought are not attorney-client privileged. The judge grants the motion to quash to the extent that it seeks tax returns, but denies the motion in all other respects. The judge also finds that the document requests in the subpoena are reasonably particularized and not overbroad. The defendants are to give notice of this order and file proof of service of same.
