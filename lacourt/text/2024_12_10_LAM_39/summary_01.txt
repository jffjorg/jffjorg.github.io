  - "The plain meaning of section 2032.320, therefore, is that the court is to describe in detail who will conduct the examination, where and when it will be conducted, the conditions, scope and nature of the examination, and the diagnostic tests and procedures to be employed."
  - "The need to identify the 'diagnostic tests and procedures' with specificity furthers the evident purpose of [section 2032.320], for example, by mitigating 'the risks of unwarranted intrusion upon the plaintiff against the defendant's need for a meaningful opportunity to test the plaintiff's claims . . . [and] will also aid the examiner in understanding and complying with the parameters imposed by the court.'"

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to submit to a mental examination with Dr. Torry, a psychiatrist. The judge finds that the motion is procedurally defective because the defendant did not specify which psychological tests Dr. Torry intends to perform on the plaintiff. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's claims of emotional distress are good cause to compel the plaintiff to submit to the examination. However, the judge denies the motion without prejudice, ordering the defendant to provide notice of the order and to file proof of service of same. The judge concludes that the defendant's failure to specify the tests to be performed is a major flaw in the motion.
