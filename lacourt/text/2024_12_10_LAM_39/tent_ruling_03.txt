BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Pricaspian
Development Corporation (“Plaintiff”) obtained a default judgment against
Defendant Florian Hamm (“Defendant”). 
The Court entered the default judgment on January 6, 2012.  In its order of June 3, 2024, the Court
granted Defendant’s motion to set aside the default judgment Plaintiff took
against Defendant.  Now, Defendant moves
to dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint.  Plaintiff
opposes the motion.   
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff filed the original complaint in
this action on August 21, 2008.  Pursuant
to this Court’s order of June 3, 2024, Plaintiff has yet to validly serve
Defendant.  As such, Defendant invokes
Code of Civil Procedure section 583.210 and moves to dismiss Plaintiff’s
complaint.  
Under Section 583.210, the Court must dismiss
an action if the plaintiff fails to serve the defendant within three years
after commencing the action.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 583. 210.)  Dismissal is mandatory unless: (1) the
defendant was “not amenable to service”; (2) the action was stayed, and the
stay affected service of summons; (3) the parties were litigating the validity
of service; or (4) service was “impossible, impracticable or futile” due to
causes beyond plaintiff's control.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 583.240.)  
In the instant case, until Defendant
challenged Plaintiff’s service of process, Plaintiff had no reason to re-serve
Defendant.  Accordingly, the Court finds serving
Defendant was impracticable from the time Plaintiff served Defendant by
publication until the Court vacated the default.  Thus, the Court denies the motion to dismiss
under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.210. 

Defendant is to give notice of this order and
to file proof of service of same.
