And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the arbitration provision in the Litigation Enforcement Agreement and has determined that it does not set forth the manner of service of a petition to confirm an arbitration award. Specifically, the provision states that service of a Petition to Compel Arbitration shall be allowed by first-class mail, postage prepaid, but this does not apply to a petition to confirm an arbitration award. Therefore, the court concludes that service of a petition to confirm an arbitration award must be made in accordance with the arbitration agreement, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4.
