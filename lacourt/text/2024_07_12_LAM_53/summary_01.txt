And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied defendant Edward Lasseville's motion to quash service of summons and complaint. The court found that Lasseville has not shown that the court lacks jurisdiction over him and that the summons is invalid. The court also found that Lasseville has not established that the Immigration Consultant Act is void for vagueness or that plaintiff Immigrant Rights Defense Council, LLC lacks standing to bring the action. The court notes that Lasseville's motion was filed on a special appearance, which is not the appropriate method to challenge subject matter jurisdiction. The court also expresses concern about the tone and content of Lasseville's written submissions, which include personal attacks and disparaging remarks against plaintiff's counsel.
