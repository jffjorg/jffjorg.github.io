The court notes that the arbitration provision in the parties’ Litigation
Enforcement Agreement states that, “[i]f either party files a Petition to
Compel Arbitration with the Superior Court, service of the Petition and Notice
of Hearing on said Petition shall be allowed by first-class mail, postage
prepaid.”  (Grant Decl., Ex. A,
Litigation Enforcement Agreement, p. 6, § 8, subd. (b).)  However, this provision does not set forth the
manner of service of a petition to confirm an arbitration award, and therefore
does not permit service by first-class mail, postage prepaid of such
petition.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4,
subd. (a) [“A copy of the petition and a written notice of the time and place
of the hearing thereof and any other papers upon which the petition is based
shall be served in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for the
service of such petition and notice”] [emphasis added].)
