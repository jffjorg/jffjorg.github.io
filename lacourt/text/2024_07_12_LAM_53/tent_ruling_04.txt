The court notes that Code of Civil Procedure section 425.55 includes
information from the California Commission on Disability Access, including the
statistics that 54 percent of all construction-related accessibility claims
between 2012 and 2014 were filed by two law firms and 46 percent of all
complaints were filed by 14 parties. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 425.55, subd. (a)(2).)  Plaintiffs, however, have not alleged facts
establishing that this language shows that the enactment of those statutes was
motivated by Plaintiffs’ protected activity.  (Tichinin, supra, 177
Cal.App.4th at pp. 1062-1063; Travelers Indemnity Company of Connecticut v.
Navigators Specialty Insurance Company (2021) 70 Cal.App.5th 341, 358
[court does not assume the truth of contentions, deductions, or conclusions of
law on demurrer (i.e., the functional equivalent of a motion for judgment on
the pleadings)].)
