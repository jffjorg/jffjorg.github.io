And here is the English-text summary:

The court's tentative ruling notes that the California Commission on Disability Access provides statistics on construction-related accessibility claims, showing that 54% of claims between 2012 and 2014 were filed by two law firms and 46% were filed by 14 parties. However, the plaintiffs have not alleged facts that demonstrate the enactment of these statutes was motivated by their protected activity. The court cites relevant case law, including Tichinin and Travelers Indemnity Company of Connecticut v. Navigators Specialty Insurance Company, to support its conclusion.
