And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is denying the defendants' motion to compel arbitration. The plaintiff, Felicidad Honkala, was admitted to Glendale Post Acute Center on December 9, 2018, and signed two arbitration agreements on December 27, 2018. The agreements were signed by both the plaintiff and her representative, Rowena Anonas. However, the plaintiff lacked capacity to contract due to her mental health condition, which was diagnosed as dementia. The court finds that the plaintiff did not have the capacity to sign the arbitration agreements and therefore denies the defendants' motion to compel arbitration.
