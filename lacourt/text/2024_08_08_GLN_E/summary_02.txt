**Case Number:** 24GDCV00368

**Tentative Ruling:**

**Demurrer and Motion to Strike**

The Court has reviewed the pleadings and the parties' arguments. After considering the legal standards and the facts presented, the Court hereby makes the following tentative rulings:

**First Cause of Action - Fraudulent Misrepresentation**

1. The demurrer to the first cause of action with respect to CalCHA is sustained due to the lack of specificity in the pleading regarding the statutory basis for liability.
2. The demurrer to the first cause of action with respect to Greystar is sustained due to the lack of specificity in the pleading regarding the representations made and how, where, and by what means they were made.

**Fourth Cause of Action - Fraudulent Misrepresentation**

The demurrer to the fourth cause of action is sustained due to the same lack of specificity in the pleading regarding the representations made and how, where, and by what means they were made.

**Second and Third Causes of Action - Breach of Fiduciary Duty**

The demurrer to the second and third causes of action is sustained due to the lack of specificity in the pleading regarding the fiduciary relationship and the breach of that relationship.

**Fifth Cause of Action - Discriminatory Action**

The demurrer to the fifth cause of action is overruled as Defendants failed to provide legal authority to support their arguments.

**Motion to Strike**

The motion to strike paragraphs 66 and 135 of the SAC is denied as the allegations are not immaterial or irrelevant to the claims.

**Meet and Confer**

The parties are reminded of their obligation to meet and confer regarding the objections raised in the demurrer and motion to strike.

**Next Steps**

The parties are ordered to file a response to the tentative ruling within 5 days. The Court will consider the responses and issue a final ruling.
