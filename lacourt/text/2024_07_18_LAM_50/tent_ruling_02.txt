[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:  
 
DEFENDANT HILLS
  ONE, LLC’S SPECIAL MOTION TO STRIKE COMPLAINT PURSUANT TO CCP § 425.16 (ANTI-SLAPP); 
 
DEFENDANT HILLS
  GROUP, LLC’S SPECIAL MOTION TO STRIKE COMPLAINT PURSUANT TO CCP § 425.16 (ANTI-SLAPP)
 



            
Plaintiff Opera Bright, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
on December 12, 2023 against Defendants Hills One, LLC (“Hills One”), Key
Compounds, LLC, Hills Group, LLC (“Hills Group”), Alex Reyter, Jay Rifkin, and Paul Fiore. The Complaint
alleges causes of action for (1) fraud, (2) fraudulent transfer, (3) conspiracy
to defraud, (4) aiding and abetting fraud, (5) negligent misrepresentation, and
(6) breach of contract.  
Hills One now moves pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 to strike
certain allegations and parts of certain causes of action in Plaintiff’s
Complaint. In addition, Hills Group now moves pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 to strike portions of certain causes of action in
Plaintiff’s Complaint. Plaintiff filed a single
opposition to Hills One’s and Hills Group’s special motions to strike.  
The special motions to strike filed by Hills One and Hills Group are continued as set
forth below.  
            In connection with Hills Group’s motion, the parties have
interposed 45 evidentiary objections. In addition, in connection with Hills
One’s motion, the parties have interposed 45 evidentiary objections.[1]
Due to the voluminous number of objections, the hearings on
the motions will be continued to a date that will be set at the Hearing on
Objections discussed below. 
The Court orders the parties to meet and confer by
telephone or in person in a serious and good faith effort to resolve and
eliminate the objections. The only objections that should remain are those that
pertain to material evidence regarding material
issues. Keeping the rules of evidence in mind, the parties should be able to
reduce the objections to just a few. If any material objections
remain unresolved, the parties are to set them forth in a joint statement with
the text, the objection, and the argument of each side in favor of their
respective positions regarding the remaining material objections, along with a
space for a ruling. 
The joint statement must be filed on or before _______ with a courtesy copy
delivered to Department 50. The Court will review any remaining
objections with the parties at a hearing on _______________ at 2:00 p.m.
(the “Hearing on Objections”). The date for the hearings on the motions will be
set at the Hearing on Objections. 
If necessary, based upon the resolutions reached during the
meet and confer process and/or at the Hearing on Objections, the parties may
respectively file and serve revised briefing and evidence. The revised evidence
may eliminate objectionable material; however, no new evidence or new
argument is to be submitted unless it is as a result of compromises reached
during the meet and confer process. In the event that revised briefing
and evidence is necessary, the Court will discuss with the parties a briefing schedule
for the revised briefing at the Hearing on Objections.   
Lastly,
the Court notes that in the event Plaintiff files an amended complaint in
response to the Court’s ruling on Hills One’s and Hills Group’s demurrers[2], the instant motions may be moot. In JKC3H8 v. Colton (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 468,
477-478, the Court of
Appeal noted that “[a]n amendatory pleading supersedes the original one, which ceases to
perform any function as a pleading. The amended complaint furnishes the sole
basis for the cause of action, and the original complaint ceases to have any
effect either as a pleading or as a basis for judgment…Because there is but one
complaint in a civil action, the filing of an amended complaint moots a motion
directed to a prior complaint. Thus, the filing of an amended complaint
renders moot a demurrer to the original complaint. Similarly, once an amended
complaint is filed, it is error to grant summary adjudication on a cause of
action contained in a previous complaint…So too does an amended complaint
render moot an anti-SLAPP motion directed to a prior complaint, with the
following caveat: A plaintiff or cross-complainant may not seek to subvert or
avoid a ruling on an anti-SLAPP motion by amending the challenged complaint or
cross-complaint in response to the motion.” (Internal quotations and citations
omitted.) 
Hills One and Hills Group are ordered to give notice of
this Order.
