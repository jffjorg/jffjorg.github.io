Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on several motions filed by defendant Jeffrey Albright. The motions sought to compel responses to discovery demands, including special interrogatories, request for production of documents, and form interrogatories. The judge has granted several of these motions, finding that the plaintiff, Tamara Levine, failed to respond to discovery demands in a timely and code-compliant manner.

The judge has also granted the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,260.00 against the plaintiff and her counsel, Lowell Steiger and Harry Nalbandyan. The judge found that the plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery demands caused the defendant to incur attorneys' fees and costs.

The judge has also noted that the plaintiff agreed to further respond to discovery demands, but failed to do so, and that the defendant's motion to compel responses was not moot. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to comply with her agreement to further respond to discovery demands and has granted the defendant's motion to compel responses as to several of the discovery demands.

The judge has also denied the defendant's request to place a new interrogatory into issue, finding that the plaintiff was not provided proper notice and opportunity to be heard on the interrogatory.
