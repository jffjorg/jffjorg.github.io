vs JEFFREY ALBRIGHT 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Defendant Jeffrey Albright’s Motion to Compel
Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, is MOOT.
Defendant Jeffrey Albright’s
Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $1,260.00
against Plaintiff Tamara Levine, Mr. Lowell Steiger, and Mr. Harry Nalbandyan,
jointly and severally, payable by 4/7/2024 to the Client Trust Account of SCHUMANN
AREVALO LLP, 30 Corporate Park, Suite 100, Irvine, CA 92606 pursuant to  CCP section 2023.010 and 2030.290(c),
discovery abuse without substantial justification.
Introduction 
Defendant Jeffrey Albright
(Defendant) moved to compel responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, (SI)
from Plaintiff Tamara Levine (Plaintiff). 
Defendant also requested $2,560.00 in monetary sanctions against Plaintiff
and Harry Nalbandyan and Lowell Steiger (collectively, Counsels).         
Discussion 
When a party has not received
timely responses to discovery demands, the party is entitled to an order
compelling responses without objections. 
(Code Civ. Proc., sec. 2030.290.) 
Defendant served the SI on June 20, 2023.  Despite twice requesting responses, Plaintiff
never responded to the SI or the meet and confer letters.  The instant motion was filed on December 18,
2023 and Plaintiff thereafter served responses to SI on February 23, 2024.    Despite Defendant’s assertion that the
motion is not moot, the motion is moot as to the request for responses because
Defendant served responses.  Issues as to
whether the responses were incomplete/not code-compliant are not properly
raised in a reply to the instant motion. 

The motion to compel responses is
MOOT.
Defendant’s request for monetary
sanctions is not moot.  Sanctions shall
be imposed unless the Court finds that the responding party acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of a
sanction unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec.
2030.290(c).)  Despite Plaintiff’s
contention that sanctions are not warranted, the Court finds otherwise.  Plaintiff failed to present any facts to show
that they acted with substantial justification. 
The circumstances surrounding the motion do not present facts showing
that imposing sanctions would be unjust. 
The SI was served back on June 20, 2023.  It was not
until after the instant motion was filed that Plaintiff served responses.  Plaintiff’s failure to timely serve responses
caused Defendant to incur attorneys’ fees and costs in having to file the
instant motion.  Because of these facts,
there is no showing that Plaintiff acted with substantial justification and no
showing of circumstances making sanctions unjust.  However, the Court finds the requested amount
to be excessive and unreasonable.  The
amount in sanctions is reduced to $1,200.00 plus $60.00 for the filing fee and
levied against Plaintiff and both Counsels, jointly and severally 

The court
notes that in Defendant’s concurrent MTC Further FI and RFP Responses,
Defendant attached a November 22, 2023 email which showed that Plaintiff agreed
to further respond to the SI.  This is
separate grounds to show that Plaintiff was less than diligent in responding to
the SI.  It is unclear why it took until
February 23, 2024 for Plaintiff to respond to the SI despite their agreement to
respond.  Plaintiff caused unnecessary
motion work.
 
 

 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Defendant Jeffrey Albright’s Motion to Compel
Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One and Two, is GRANTED
as to ALL requests.  Verified CODE
COMPLIANT responses and production of documents due within 20 days.  Documents must be individually numbered per
page and a compliance document served which sets forth which pages of documents
are responsive to which RFP.
Defendant Jeffrey Albright’s
Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $1,260.00
against Plaintiff Tamara Levine, Mr. Lowell Steiger, and Mr. Harry Nalbandyan,
jointly and severally, payable by 4/7/2024 to the Client Trust Account of SCHUMANN
AREVALO LLP, 30 Corporate Park, Suite 100, Irvine, CA 92606 pursuant to  CCP section 2023.010, discovery abuse without
substantial justification.
Introduction 
Defendant Jeffrey Albright
(Defendant) moved to compel further responses to Request for Production of
Documents, Set One and Two, (collectively, RFP) from Plaintiff Tamara Levine
(Plaintiff).  Defendant also requested
$4,500.00 in monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and Harry Nalbandyan and
Lowell Steiger (collectively, Counsels). 
The RFP Set One included only one demand for production (i.e., RFP no.
1) and RFP Set Two included 32 demands for productions (i.e., RFP nos.
2-33.)  All demands in both RFPs are
placed into issue.
Defendant filed two Separate
Statements with the instant motion.  The
first was filed on 12/19/23 at 9:29 A.M. and the second was filed a few minutes
later at 9:32 A.M.  The two are verbatim
copies of each other.  The court
considers whether Defendant mistakenly filed two RFP separate statements when
they meant to file a separate statement for the concurrent MTC Further FI
Responses.
Procedure 
Defendant’s motion sufficiently
submitted compliance with the meet and confer requirement.  (Ortega-Carrillo Decl., Exh. D.)  Defendant further timely filed the motion on
December 18, 2023 based upon the parties written agreement to extend the
deadline to December 29, 2023. 
(Ortega-Carrillo Decl., Exh F.)  
Discussion 
When responses to document
demands are evasive or incomplete or if the objections raised are meritless or
too general, the propounding party may bring a motion to compel further
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 2031.310.)  The motion must set forth specific facts
showing good cause justifying the discovery sought.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 2031.310(b)(1).)  A document response must consist of: 1) an
agreement to comply, stating whether the productions or inspection will be
allowed “in whole or in part,” and that all documents or things in the
possession, custody or control of the respondent, as to which no objection is
made, will be included, by the date set for inspection (unless informally
extended in writing, or the designated timing is subject to objection); 2) a
representation of inability to comply, with a statement stating a diligent
search and reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to locate the item
demanded; and the reason the party is unable to comply: (i.e., the document:
never existed; or has been lost or stolen; or has been destroyed; or is not in
the possession, custody or control of the responding party, in which case, the
response must state the name and address of anyone believed to have the
document; or, 3) objections and specification of withheld documents. (Code Civ.
Proc., secs. 2031.210(a) , 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, 2031.270,
2031.280(b).)
Good cause for the document
demands is sufficiently shown by Defendant because the demands all involved
Defendant’s attempt to obtain Plaintiff’s evidence in support of her
claims.  
Preliminarily, the Court noted
that Plaintiff agreed to serve further responses to all RFP on November 22,
2023.  (Ortega-Carrillo Decl., Exh
F.)  Despite this agreement to further
respond, Plaintiff now stands on the contention that their prior response
served on September 25, 2023 was sufficient and code-compliant.  Based upon Plaintiff’s agreement to further
respond, there is good cause to order Plaintiff to comply with their agreement
to further respond.
The Court further reviewed the
sufficiency of Plaintiff’s September 25, 2023 responses, as requested by
Defendant.  As to RFP 1-2, 6-7, 9, 11,
13, 17-18, 22-23, 25, 31-33, Plaintiff’s response, in relevant part, stated:  “Plaintiff produces all documents within his
possession, custody and control that are responsive to this request.  Discovery and investigation are ongoing.”  The response failed to comply with the
Discovery Act because it did not provide if the production will be “in whole or
in part.”  The statement “produces all
documents” is insufficient to clarify that the production is “in whole or in
part.”  For this defect in the responses,
there is good cause to require Plaintiff to serve a further responses.
The motion to compel further
responses as to RFP 1-2, 6-7, 9, 11, 13, 17-18, 22-23, 25, 31-33 is
GRANTED.  
As to RFP  3-5, 8, 10, 12, 14-16, 19-21, 24, 26-30,
Plaintiff stated, in relevant part: 
“after a reasonable and diligent search, is not in possession, custody
and/or control of any documents responsive to this request. Discovery and
investigation are ongoing.”  However, the
response is not code-compliant because it does not provide whether the
item/category has never existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced,
or stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or
control of Plaintiff and if Plaintiff knows or reasonably believes that the
evidence is within the possession, custody, or control of another party, the
name and address of that party.  For
these defects in the responses, there is good cause to require Plaintiff to
serve a further response.
The motion to compel further
responses as to RFP  3-5, 8, 10, 12,
14-16, 19-21, 24, 26-30 is GRANTED.

Sanctions
are mandatory against the non-prevailing party unless the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.  (Code
Civ. Proc., sec. 2031.310(h).) 
Defendant’s request is unreasonable because there are no facts to
support the hourly rate charged or the time expended.  The Court reduces the sanctions request to a
reasonable amount of $1,200.00 and adds the $60 filing fee.  The request for sanctions is GRANTED in the
amount of $1,260.00 and against Plaintiff and both Counsel.
 

 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Defendant Jeffrey Albright’s Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, is GRANTED as to Form
Interrogatories nos. 2.7(b), 4.0(c), 6.3(c), 6.4, 6.5(e), 6.6(c) and (d), 6.7,
and 12.4(d) and (e).  The motion as to
Form Interrogatory no. 12.1(a) was voluntarily withdrawn and thus MOOT.
Defendant Jeffrey Albright’s
Request for Monetary Sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $1,260.00
against Plaintiff Tamara Levine, Mr. Lowell Steiger, and Mr. Harry Nalbandyan,
jointly and severally, payable by 4/7/2024 to the Client Trust Account of SCHUMANN
AREVALO LLP, 30 Corporate Park, Suite 100, Irvine, CA 92606 pursuant to CCP
section 2023.010 and 2030.290(c), discovery abuse without substantial
justification.
 Introduction 
Defendant Jeffrey Albright
(Defendant) moved to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One,
(FI) from Plaintiff Tamara Levine (Plaintiff). 
Defendant also requested $3,060.00 in monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff and Harry Nalbandyan and Lowell Steiger (collectively,
Counsels).  The motion placed into issue
FI 2.7(b), 4.0(c), 6.3(c), 6.4, 6.5(e), 6.6(c) and (d), 6.7, 12.1(a), and
12.4(d) and (e).
Procedure 
Defendant’s motion sufficiently
submitted compliance with the meet and confer requirement.  (Ortega-Carrillo Decl., Exh. C.)  Defendant further timely filed the motion on
December 18, 2023 based upon the parties written agreement to extend the
deadline to December 29, 2023. 
(Ortega-Carrillo Decl., Exh E.)  
Despite Defendant asserting that
a Separate Statement was concurrently filed with the motion, none was
filed.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345.)  Plaintiff’s opposition did not
object on this defect so the court reviewed the motion without a Separate
Statement. 
Discussion 
When responses to interrogatories
are evasive or incomplete or if the objections raised are meritless or too
general, the propounding party may bring a motion to compel further
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 2030.300.)  Answers to interrogatories must be as
complete and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the
responding party permits; if an interrogatory cannot be answered completely, it
shall be answered to the extent possible; and if the responding party does not
have personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that
party shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to
obtain the information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations,
except where the information is equally available to the propounding
party.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec.
2030.220.)  
Plaintiff’s response to FI 2.7(b)
is insufficient because Plaintiff failed to respond to the question asked and
to show that a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information was
made.  Plaintiff’s failing memory does
not absolve her from seeking the information requested.
The motion as to FI 2.7(b) is
GRANTED.  
Plaintiff’s response to FI 4.0(c)
did not answer the question.  The
interrogatory requested the name, address and phone number of each named
insured.  Responding with “Plaintiff” did
not answer the question.  It cannot be
ascertained from the response that Plaintiff is the one and only person that is
a “named insured.”  The response is
deficient.  
The motion as to FI 4.0(c) is
GRANTED.  
Plaintiff’s response to FI 6.3(c)
does not answer the question posed because the duration of each complaint was
not provided.  Further, Plaintiff’s
November 22, 2023 email expressly stated that Plaintiff was “agreeable to
providing responses” to this FI. 
(Ortega-Carrillo Decl., Exh E.) 
On the separate ground that Plaintiff agreed to further respond to this
FI, there is good cause to order Plaintiff to comply with their agreement to
further respond.
The motion as to FI 6.3(c) is
GRANTED.
Plaintiff’s response to FI 6.4,
6.5(e), 6.6 (c) and (d), and 6.7 provided that discovery or an investigation
are ongoing or pending.  This is not a
Code-compliant response.  Plaintiff
failed to state that a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the
information.  The responses are
deficient.  Further, Plaintiff’s November
22, 2023 email expressly stated that Plaintiff was “agreeable to providing
responses” to these FI.  (Ortega-Carrillo
Decl., Exh E.)  On the separate ground
that Plaintiff agreed to further respond to these FI, there is good cause to
order Plaintiff to comply with their agreement to further respond.
The motion as to FI 6.4, 6.5(e),
6.6 (c) and (d), and 6.7 is GRANTED.
Plaintiff voluntarily withdrew
the motion as to FI 12.1(a).  The motion
as to FI 12.1(a) is MOOT.
The response to FI 12.4(d) and
(e) did not provide a code compliant response because “pedestrian pending
identification” did not respond to the question requesting “name, address, and
phone number of the “pedestrian” and the persons having originals or copies of
the photos, films, or videotapes.  
The motion as to FI 12.4(d) and
(e) is GRANTED.
The Court noted that Defendant’s
Reply placed into issue a new interrogatory not identified in the notice of the
points and authorities, FI 4.1(g). 
Because Plaintiff was not provided proper notice and opportunity to be
heard on FI 4.1(g). the Reply’s request to place FI 4.1(g) into issue is
DENIED.  
Sanctions are mandatory against
the non-prevailing party unless the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of the
sanction unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., sec.
2030.300(d).)  Defendant’s request is
unreasonable because there are no facts to support the hourly rate charged or
the time expended.  The Court reduces the
sanctions request to a reasonable amount of $1,200.00 and adds the $60 filing
fee.  The request for sanctions is
GRANTED in the amount of $1,260.00 and against Plaintiff and both Counsels.
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
