 Case Number:  23VECV04247    Hearing Date:   March 7, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECV04247 ELLA MILMAN vs
TARZANA WOODS
[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Defendant Icon Realty Services, Inc.’s Motion
to Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint is taken OFF-CALENDAR due to the
January 3, 2024 entry of default.
 Introduction 
Defendant Icon Realty Services,
Inc. (Defendant) moved to quash Plaintiff Ella Milman’s (Plaintiff) service of
the summons and complaint.
Procedure 
Defendant filed their motion to
quash on January 29, 2024.  However,
Plaintiff had Defendant’s default entered on January 3, 2024.  It is noted that Plaintiff submitted/filed
two requests for entry of default on January 3, 2024.  The first, filed at 4:32 P.M., was rejected
by the Court.  The second, filed at 4:55
P.M., was granted/entered.  As it stands,
Defendant is in default and “out of Court.” 
Without addressing the default, Defendant’s right to appear in this
action is cut off.  (Devlin v. Kearny
Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385-386.)  Because Defendant’s right to appear is cut
off, the Court did not consider the motion to quash.
The alleged non-service of the
First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed on February 7, 2024 has no bearing on the
issue of Defendant’s default.  Because
Defendant was in default when the FAC was filed, service of the FAC upon
Defendant was not required.  
The motion to quash is taken
OFF-CALENDAR.
