And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has taken the Defendant's motion to quash service of the summons and complaint off the calendar due to the entry of default on January 3, 2024. The Defendant filed its motion to quash on January 29, 2024, but since it was already in default, it did not have the right to appear in the action. The Court did not consider the motion to quash as a result. Additionally, the filing of the First Amended Complaint on February 7, 2024 did not affect the issue of service, as the Defendant was already in default when the complaint was filed.
