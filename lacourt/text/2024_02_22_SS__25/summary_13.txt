The Tentative Ruling:

The Court has reviewed the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Plaintiffs Judith Guerra and Gloria Guerra against Defendants United Financial Casualty Company, AFNI, and AAA Insurance. Defendant United demurred to the FAC, arguing that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for negligence.

The Court finds that the FAC does not state a claim for negligence against Defendant United. The FAC does not allege that Defendant United owed Plaintiffs a duty, does not allege the breach of a duty, and does not allege causation. The Court sustains Defendant United's demurrer to the FAC without leave to amend.

The Court notes that Plaintiffs are self-represented and are held to the same standard as an attorney. The lack of an opposition brief leads to an inference that the demurrer is meritorious. The Court also notes that Plaintiffs' acknowledgment in the FAC that Defendant United was not the insurance carrier for Plaintiffs makes it impossible for them to maintain a negligence claim against Defendant United.

As a result, the Court orders the moving party to give notice and electronically submit a proposed judgment of dismissal within 10 days of this order.
