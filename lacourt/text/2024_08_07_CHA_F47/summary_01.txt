And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the motion filed by Xi Wang, the defendant and cross-complainant, seeking an order confirming him as a director and CEO of BigBattery, Inc. and removing Clifford Eric Lungren as director and officer. The judge found that Wang failed to provide clear notice of the relief sought in the motion, and that the motion is not merely seeking to have the Court determine the validity of any election or appointment of any director, but rather seeks to have the Court adjudicate discovery disputes and the merits of the claims in the complaint and cross-complaint. The judge also noted that Wang's motion is not based on a legitimate claim under Corporations Code 709, which permits the Court to determine the validity of any election or appointment of any director.
