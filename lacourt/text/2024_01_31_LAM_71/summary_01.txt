And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, Edwin Kawasaki, Steve Radell, William Miller, William Janson, Lois Evans, Caj Brejtfus, and Carl Shaff (deceased), have moved for summary adjudication of the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 12th, and 15th causes of action in the plaintiff, Wesley Robbins' first amended complaint. The motion is denied because the defendants' separate statement fails to identify each cause of action as required by California Rules of Court Rule 3.1350(d). The judge finds that this failure constitutes a sufficient ground for denial of the motion.
