 Case
  No.:  21STCV03788
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  February 1, 2024



 
Defendants Edwin
Kawasaki’s, Steve Radell’s, William Miller’s, William Janson’s, Lois Evans’,
Caj Brejtfus’, and Carl Shaff’s (deceased) motion for summary adjudication of pro per Plaintiff
Wesley Robbins’ 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 12th, and 15th causes of action in his
first amended complaint is denied.  
 
Defendants
Edwin Kawasaki (“Kawasaki”), Steve Radell (“Radell”), William Miller (“Miller”),
William Janson (“Janson”), Lois Evans (“Evans”), Caj Brejtfus (“Brejtfus”), and
Carl Shaff (deceased) (“Shaff”) (collectively, “Moving Defendants”) move for
summary adjudication of pro per Plaintiff Wesley
Robbins’ (“Robbins”) (“Plaintiff”) 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 12th, and 15th causes of action in his first amended
complaint.[1]  (Notice Motion, pgs. 2-3.)
 
CRC
Violations
CRC, Rule 3.1350(d) provides that when
multiple causes of action, issues or defenses are presented for summary
adjudication in one motion, each cause of action, issue or defense to which the
motion is directed must have a separate section heading indicating the issue
number and specifying the issue. The headings must be followed by two columns.
 (CRC, Rule 3.1350(d); see
CRC, Rule 3.1350(h) [illustrating format for separate statements in a motion
for summary adjudication].)  Failure to
comply with the requirements for filing a separate statement may in the trial
judge’s discretion constitute a sufficient ground for denial of the motion.  (C.C.P. §437c(b)(1).)
Moving Defendants’ separate statement is in violation of CRC, Rule 3.1350(d) because it fails to identify each
cause of action in its separate statement for its motion for summary
adjudication.  Accordingly, Moving
Defendants’ motion for summary adjudication is denied on the basis its separate
statement is defective.
 
Conclusion
Moving
Defendants’ motion for summary adjudication of the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th,
12th, and 15th causes of action is denied. 

Moving
