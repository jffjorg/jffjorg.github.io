Plaintiffs Francisco
Ortiz’s and Cristian Ortiz’s motion to compel the deposition of Defendant General Motors

is granted.  Defendant’s Person(s) Most Qualified and
Custodian of Records is ordered to appear for deposition within 20 days and provide

Plaintiffs’ request for monetary sanctions against Defendant is

          Plaintiffs Francisco Ortiz
(“Francisco”) and Cristian Ortiz (“Cristian”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) move
to compel
the deposition of Defendant General Motors LLC’s (“GM”) (“Defendant”) Person(s)
Most Qualified and Custodian of Records (“PMQ”) to appear for deposition and
produce documents.  (Notice of Motion,
pg. 1; C.C.P §2025.450(a).)  Plaintiffs also move for an order awarding
monetary sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $1,860.00.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 1; C.C.P §2025.450(g)(1).)
 
Meet and Confer
C.C.P. §2025.450(b)(2) requires that a motion to
compel a party deponent to appear or produce documents “shall be accompanied by
a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent
fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance.”  (C.C.P. §2025.450(b)(2).)  The attempt to resolve informally may be made
either by conferring “in person, by telephone, or by letter with an opposing
party or attorney.”  (C.C.P.
§2023.010(i), [failure to make such attempt constitutes “misuse of discovery
process”].)
Plaintiffs’ counsel declares he noticed the November 29, 2023,
deposition of Defendant’s PMQ on November 8, 2023, and requested that Defendant
provide alternative dates for the deposition by November 15, 2023, if that date
did not work.  (Decl. of
Thomas ¶¶3-4, Exhs. A, B.) 
Plaintiffs’ counsel declares on November 22, 2023, Defendant’s counsel served
objections to Plaintiffs’ Notice of Deposition stating that no witness would be
produced on the noticed date.  (Decl.
of Thomas ¶5, Exh. C.)  Plaintiffs’
counsel declares on November 27, 2023, Plaintiffs sent Defendant a
detailed meet and confer letter addressing the deficiencies in Defendant’s
objection to Plaintiffs’ Notice of Deposition. 
(Decl. of Thomas ¶6, Exh. D.)  
Plaintiffs’ counsel declares that on November 29, 2023, at 11:30 AM, Plaintiffs
logged on to the video link for the deposition and stayed on for 30 minutes,
but Defendant’s PMQ did not appear.  (Decl. of Thomas ¶8.)  Plaintiffs’
counsel declares he then sent Defendant an email offering Defendant an
additional three business days to provide dates for the deposition, to which
Defendant did not respond.  (Decl. of Thomas
¶8, Exh. E.)
  Plaintiffs’ counsel’s meet and confer efforts are
sufficient per the requirements to meet and confer “in person, by telephone, or
by letter with an opposing party or attorney.” 
(C.C.P. §2023.010(i).)
 
Discussion
Having reviewed Plaintiffs’ motion to compel
Defendant’s PMQ to attend and produce documents at deposition, the Court rules
as follows.
          Plaintiffs
noticed the November 29, 2023, deposition of Defendant’s PMQ on November 8,
2023, and requested that Defendant provide alternative dates for the deposition
by November 15, 2023, if that date did not work.  (Decl. of Thomas ¶¶3-4, Exhs. A, B.)  Plaintiffs’ Notice of Deposition identified
four (4) matters for examination and six (6) requests for document production related
to Defendant’s pre-litigation analysis as to whether the Subject Vehicle should
be repurchased, all repairs and service performed on the Subject Vehicle, Defendant’s
policies and procedures for determining whether a vehicle qualifies for a repurchase
or replacement under the Song-Beverly Act, and Defendant’s training for
evaluating a prelitigation repurchase request under the Song-Beverly Act.  (Decl. of Thomas ¶3, Exh. A.)  On November 22, 2023, Defendant’s counsel served
objections to Plaintiffs’ Notice of Deposition stating that no witness would be
produced on the noticed date.  (Decl. of Thomas
¶5, Exh. C.)  On November 29, 2023, at 11:30
AM, Plaintiffs logged on to the video link for the deposition and stayed on for
30 minutes, but Defendant’s PMQ did not appear. 
(Decl. of Thomas ¶8.)
Plaintiffs filed the instant motion on December 8,
2023.  Defendant filed its opposition on January
18, 2024.  Plaintiffs filed their reply
on January 24, 2024.
Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause to compel the
deposition of Defendant’s PMQ because Plaintiffs properly noticed the
deposition, Plaintiffs’ matters for examination were reasonably particularized,
and the matters for examination are relevant and material to Plaintiffs’
Song-Beverly Claims.  (See
Plaintiffs’ Separate Statement.)  To the
extent Defendant objects to Plaintiffs matters for examination seek the
production of trade secret material, Defendant can move for a protective
order.  (C.C.P. §2025.420.)
          The
Court grants Plaintiffs’ motion pursuant to C.C.P. §2025.450 and orders Defendant’s PMQ to appear for
deposition and produce responsive documents in 20 days.  Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause to
order Defendant to testify on all categories of Plaintiff’s notice and respond
to all requests for production.
 
Sanctions
The court
shall impose a monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel an answer or production,
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of sanctions
unjust. (C.C.P. §2025.450(g)(1).)
Plaintiffs’ counsel declares he spent 1.5 hours drafting the
instant motion at a rate of $450.00 per hour and anticipates spending an
additional 1.5 hours reviewing Defendant’s opposition and drafting a reply, and
an additional 1.0 hour preparing for and attending the hearing on this
matter.  (Decl. of Thomas ¶9.)  Plaintiffs’ counsel also declares his office
incurred the cost of $60.00 for filing the instant motion.  (Decl. of Thomas ¶10.)  The Court calculates Plaintiffs’ counsel’s
fees incurred on the instant motion as follows:
($450.00/hour x 4 hours) + $60.00 = $1,860.00
Sanctions are payable by Defendant within 20 days.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiffs’ motion to compel the deposition of Defendant’s PMQ
granted.  Defendant’s PMQ is ordered to
appear for deposition and produce responses to the request for production
within 20 days.
Plaintiffs’ request for monetary sanctions against Defendant is
granted in the amount of $1,860.00.
