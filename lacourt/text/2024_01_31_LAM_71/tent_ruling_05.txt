 Hearing
  Date:  January 31, 2024



 
Defendant Robert Webb’s demurrer to Plaintiffs
Deborah Mayers’, Marcia Brown’s, and Rochelle Minor’s
complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
Defendant Robert Webb (“Webb”) (“Defendant”) demurs to Plaintiffs Deborah Mayers’ (“Mayers”), Marcia Brown’s
(“Brown”), and Rochelle Minor’s (“Minor”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)
complaint (“Complaint”) as to each cause of action.  (Notice of Demurrer, pgs.
1-2.)
 
Background
Plaintiffs filed the operative Complaint on October 14, 2022,
against Defendant and Non-moving Defendants J.P. Morgan Chase N.A. dba J.P.
Morgan Chase National Corporate Services, Inc. (“J.P. Morgan Chase”) and all
persons unknown claiming and legal or equitable title, estate, lien, or
interest in the property described in the Complaint adverse to Plaintiffs’
title or any cloud upon Plaintiffs’ title (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging
a single cause of action for quiet title.
On September 25, 2023, Webb filed the instant demurrer.  On January 18, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their
opposition.  As of the date of this
hearing no reply has been filed.
 
Summary of Demurrer
Webb demurs to Plaintiff’s 1st cause of action on the basis that the
cause of action fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action,
that Plaintiffs have filed their claim in the wrong court because the Probate
Court has exclusive jurisdiction over matters relating to the internal affairs
of a trust, and pursuant to Probate Code §§16061.7 and 16061.8, Plaintiffs are
permanently barred from pursuing any claims concerning the terms of the trust
as amended.  (Demurrer, pg. 3; C.C.P.
§430.10(e).)
 
          Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring
party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who
filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer.  (C.C.P.
§430.41(a), emphasis added.)  A
declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the results of the meet and
confer process.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(3).)
Webb’s counsel’s declaration states that on September 11, 2023, his
office sent correspondence to Plaintiffs’ counsel requesting a date to meet and
confer regarding the deficiencies raised in the instant demurrer.  (Decl. of Buck ¶3.)  Webb’s counsel declares
that same day his office attempted to meet and confer, and that respective
counsels for the parties could not come to an agreement, necessitating the
instant demurrer.  (Decl. of Buck ¶¶4,
6.)  Webb’s counsel’s declaration is
insufficient under C.C.P. §430.41(a)(3) because he does not indicate parties met
and conferred in person or by telephone, as required by the statute.  However, failure to sufficiently meet and
confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(4).)  Accordingly, the Court will consider the
instant demurrer.

 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc.
(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable.  (See Donabedian v.
Mercury Insurance Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a
demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to
judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their
contents].)  For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the
reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital District
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State a Claim
Quiet Title (1st COA)
A cause of action for quiet title must allege the following
elements: (1) a description of the property; (2) plaintiff’s title or interest
and the basis; (3) defendant’s asserting adverse claim or antagonistic property
interest; (4) the date as of which the determination is sought; and (5) a prayer
for determination of title.   (C.C.P. §761.020; see Lucas v. Sweet
(1956) 47 Cal.2d 20, 22 [sufficient to plead that plaintiff is the owner of
described property, defendant wrongfully claims interest, unless complaint
reveals a defect in title];  Leeper v.
Beltrami (1959) 53 Cal. 2d 195, 214 [“general rule that a cause of action
to quiet title may be stated in general terms”]; Dreher v. Rohrmoser
(1955) 134 Cal.App.2d 196, 198 [complainants can specifically plead the
invalidity of defendants’ legal title and courts may enter such judgment as the
equities require]; Lewis v. Superior Court (1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1850,
1866 [complaint to quiet title must be verified]; Chao Fu, Inc. v. Wen Ching
Chen (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 48, 57 [“absent an interest in the property, a
party has no standing to ask the court to quiet title in the property or to
obtain damages for the cloud on title.”].)
          Plaintiffs allege this
case involves the residential property located at 6577 2nd Avenue, Los Angeles,
CA 90043 (“Property”).  (Complaint
¶10.)  Plaintiffs allege the
Property is legally described as follows: “ALL REAL PROPERTY SITUATED IN THE
CITY OF LOS ANGELES, COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES, STATE OF CALIFORNIA, DESCRIBED AS :
LOT 22, BLOCK 9 OF TRACT NO 6543, AS PER MAP RECORDED IN BOOK 71, PAGES 35 TO
36 INCLUSIVE, IN THE OFFICE OF THE COUNTY RECORDER OF SAID COUNTY.”  (Complaint ¶11.)
          Plaintiffs allege
on or about September 26, 2005, Mary Smith (“Decedent”) the owner of the Property,
executed an inter vivos trust entitled The Mary Marcella Smith Living Trust
Dated September 26, 2005 (“Trust”).  (Complaint
¶12, Exh. 1.)  Plaintiffs allege subsequently, the Decedent executed a
restatement (amendment) of the Trust, which is dated November 10, 2010 (“November
10, 2010, Trust Amendment”).  (Complaint
¶13, Exh. 2.)  Plaintiffs allege thereafter,
on or about June 5, 2013, the Decedent executed another restatement (amendment)
of the Trust (“June 5, 2013, Trust Amendment”). 
(Complaint ¶14, Exh. 3.)  Plaintiffs allege subsequently, on or about
December 15, 2017, the decedent executed a Revocation of the Mary Marcella
Smith Living Trust (“Revocation”).  (Complaint
¶15, Exh. 4.)
          Plaintiffs allege
ultimately, Decedent died on or about October 4, 2018.  (Complaint
¶16.)  Plaintiffs allege the
Defendant, on or about July 16, 2019, filed an Application to Probate Will and
for Issuance of Letters Testamentary in Jefferson County, Texas.  (Complaint
¶17.)  Plaintiffs allege on or
about August 12, 2019, they filed an Opposition to Defendant’s Application to
Probate Will and for Issuance of Letters Testamentary in Jefferson County,
Texas.  (Complaint
¶18.)  Plaintiffs allege to resolve
the matter filed in Jefferson County, Texas, Plaintiffs Mayers and Brown signed
a Family Settlement Agreement (“Settlement Agreement”) with Defendant on or
about July of 2020.   (Complaint ¶19.)  Plaintiffs allege the
Settlement Agreement involves the Property that is the subject of this suit,
which purports to leave the Property with Defendant.  (Complaint ¶19.)  
Plaintiffs allege subsequently, on or about October 13, 2020,
Defendant executes a grant deed (“Trust Deed”) transferring the Property from
Decedent’s Trust to Defendant.  (Complaint
¶20.) 
Plaintiffs allege this Trust Deed was ultimately recorded
at the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office on or about May 18, 2021.  (Complaint ¶20, Exh. 5.)  
Plaintiffs allege
on information and belief that
due to the fact that Decedent executed a Revocation of the Trust, the Property
here in Los Angeles County, California must be probated to legally and validly
to transfer ownership from the Decedent to her lawful heirs, which are the
Plaintiffs.  (Complaint ¶21.)  Plaintiffs allege on
information and belief that Defendant is not the true owner of the Property,
but instead Plaintiffs are since the Property has not legally transferred to
Plaintiffs.  (Complaint ¶22.)
Plaintiffs allege by virtue of the foregoing facts, Plaintiffs are
entitled to a judicial declaration that they are the true 100.00% owners of the
subject Property.  (Complaint ¶26.)  Plaintiffs allege they seek to quiet title to
the Property in Plaintiffs’ names alone as of the date of May 18, 2021.  (Complaint ¶27.)
          “The owner of the
legal title to property is presumed to be the owner of the full beneficial
title. This presumption may be rebutted only by clear and convincing proof.”  (Evid. Code §662.)  There is no exception to this evidentiary
rule, even where the plaintiff claims that the Defendant breached a fiduciary
duty. (Toney v. Nolde (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 791, 796.)  “[A]s a general matter an action to quiet
title cannot be maintained by the owner of equitable title as against the
holder of legal title.”  (Warren v. Merrill (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 96, 113.) 
When legal title has been acquired through fraud any number of remedies
are available and appropriate.  (Id.
at pg. 114.)  These remedies include
quieting title in the defrauded equitable title holder’s name and making the
legal title holder the constructive trustee of the property for the benefit of
the defrauded equitable titleholder.  (Id.)
          As a preliminary
matter, an action by a beneficiary against the trustee for, e.g., breach of
trust, conversion, or fraud concerns the internal affairs of the trust and
therefore must be heard by the court having jurisdiction over the trust under
Probate Code §17000(a).  (Prob.
Code §17000(a).)  The “probate court,” or
probate department of the superior court hearing proceedings concerning the
internal affairs of trusts, has “all the powers of the superior court.”  (Prob. Code §17001.)  Plaintiffs’ Complaint does not allege the
existence of a valid trust, but rather that the Trust at issue was
revoked.  (Complaint ¶15, Exh. 4.)  Further, neither party requested judicial
notice of other filings in LASC’s Probate Division that would indicate this
Court is without jurisdiction to decide matters in the instant case.
Regarding a valid cause of action for quiet title, here,
Plaintiffs allege Webb is the owner of the legal title to the Property.  (Complaint ¶20, Exh. 5.)  Plaintiffs do not allege Webb acquired legal
titled through fraud, as they allege Mayers and Brown entered into a Settlement
Agreement with Webb in or about July 2020, which purports to leave the Property
with Defendant (assumed to mean Webb).  (Complaint ¶19.)  Plaintiffs fail to allege their interest in
the Property, namely that they are Decedent’s heirs by intestate succession.  Plaintiffs merely allege Decedent is
Plaintiffs’ mother and grandmother of Defendant (assumed to mean Webb).  (Complaint ¶6.)
Accordingly, Webb’s demurrer to Plaintiffs’ 1st cause of action is
sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Conclusion
Webb’s demurrer to Plaintiffs’ Complaint is sustained with
20 days leave to amend.
