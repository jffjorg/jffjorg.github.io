Statutes: Code of Civil Procedure § 415.20(b), Code of Civil Procedure § 418.10, subd. (a)(1)
Roles: Judge, Plaintiff, Defendant
Significant Statements: The Court finds that Plaintiff has not demonstrated adequate facts to establish effective service on Ms. Kim. The Proof of Service filed with the Court does not show any attempted service on Ms. Kim before the date of her termination, September 18, 2023. The first recorded attempt, according to the declaration of diligence, occurred on September 25, 2023. The next attempted date of service on Ms. Kim was November 17, 2023, nearly two months later. All listed attempts for service were at the same business address for Greystar. The Court agrees with Defendants' contention that the address for a person's former employer cannot be considered their "usual place of business" or "usual mailing address" under CCP § 415.20(b).
