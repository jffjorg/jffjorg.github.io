The judge has ruled that the motion to quash the deposition subpoena served on Wells Fargo Bank is denied.

The judge finds that the subpoena is not overly broad and is not burdensome on Wells Fargo. The judge also finds that Burbank Imaging has no legitimate expectation of privacy in property gained through a fraudulent scheme, and that the Stipulation and Protective Order will mitigate any privacy concerns related to the Account Records. Finally, the judge finds that the Account Records are not covered by the attorney-client privilege.
