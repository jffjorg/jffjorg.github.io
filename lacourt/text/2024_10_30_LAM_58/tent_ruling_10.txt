Quash Service of Summons and Complaint on Defendant Lea Kim is GRANTED
 

 
Background
 
            This is an
action arising out of an alleged breach of a rental agreement. Plaintiffs Byron
Guzman and Nakeela Dillard (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) claim that Defendants,
including SBDTLA 1, LLC; SBDTLA 2, LLC; SBDTLA 3, LLC; SBDTLA 4, LLC; Greystar
California, Inc.; and Lea Kim (“Ms. Kim”) (collectively, “Defendants”) are
liable because the apartment unit Plaintiffs rented was a substandard dwelling,
and not habitable.
 
            On August
18, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their original Complaint alleging the following
causes of action against Defendants: (1) violation of Civil Code § 1942.4; (2)
tortious breach of the warranty of habitability; (3) private nuisance; (4)
unfair competition in violation of Business & Professions Code § 17200,
et seq.; (5) negligence; (6) breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment; (7)
intentional infliction of emotional distress; (8) violation of the Consumer
Legal Remedies Act, Civil Code § 1750, et seq.; (9) violation of the Los
Angeles Tenant Anti-Harassment Ordinance; (10) false advertising in violation
of the Business & Professions Code § 17500, et seq.; (11) negligent
hiring, retention, and supervision; and (12) intentional influence to vacate.
 
            On December
18, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the operative First Amended Complaint, which removed
the tenth cause of action for false advertising against all Defendants pursuant
to this Court’s November 28, 2023 Minute Order granting Defendant FPI
Management’s demurrer without leave to amend.
 
            On December
20, 2023, Plaintiffs filed Proof of Service by Substituted Service on Ms. Kim.
This declaration, signed by registered California process server Nicholas
Kosearas, establishes that Plaintiffs served Ms. Kim by substituted service on
December 5, 2023, at the business address for Defendant Greystar California,
620 Newport Center Drive, 15th Floor, Newport Beach, CA 92660. The attached
declaration of diligence states that Kosearas attempted to personally serve Lea
Kim at the business address two prior times—on September 25, 2023, and November
17, 2023—before he left the Summons and Complaint with an Administrative
Assistant who was present at the address, in lieu of Ms. Kim.
 
            On October
2, 2024, Defendants filed the instant Motion to Quash Service of Summons on
Defendant Lea Kim.
 
            On October
14, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an Opposition. And on October 15, 2024, Defendants
filed their Reply.
 
Discussion
 
Legal Standard
 
A defendant may move to quash
service of summons on the ground the Court lacks personal jurisdiction. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a)(1).) “Although the defendant is the
moving party, the plaintiff must carry the initial burden of demonstrating
facts by a preponderance of evidence justifying the exercise of jurisdiction in
California.” (In re Automobile Antitrust Cases I and II (2005) 135
Cal.App.4th 100, 110.)
 
Filing a proof of service by a
registered process server creates a rebuttable presumption that service was
proper. (American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th
383, 390; Evid. Code, § 647 [“The return of a process server registered
pursuant to … the Business and Professions Code upon process or notice
establishes a presumption, affecting the burden of producing evidence, of the
facts stated in the return”].) However, the presumption only arises if the
proof of service complies with the statutory requirements regarding such
proofs. (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426,
1441-1442.) Proof of service of summons may be impeached by evidence that
contradicts it. (City of Los Angeles v. Morgan (1951) 105 Cal.App.2d
726, 731.) When a defendant moves to quash service of summons, the plaintiff
has “the burden of proving the facts that did give the court jurisdiction, that
is the facts requisite to an effective service.” (Coulston v. Cooper
(1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 866, 868.) 
 
Substitute service is a secondary
method of service (Evartt v. Superior Court (1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 795,
799) and in order to obtain personal jurisdiction through any form of
constructive service, there must be strict compliance with statutory
requirements (Stamps v. Superior Court (1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 108, 110.)
“To be constitutionally sound, the form of substituted service must be
‘reasonably calculated to give an interested party actual notice of the
proceedings and an opportunity to be heard … in order that the traditional
notions of fair play and substantial justice implicit in due process are
satisfied.’ [Citation.]” (Zirbes v. Stratton (1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1407,
1416; see also Ellard v. Conway (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 540, 544
(“Statutes governing substitute service shall be liberally construed to
effectuate service and uphold jurisdiction if actual notice has been
received by the defendant. [Citations.]”) (cleaned up) (internal citations
omitted) (emphasis added); Bein v Brechtel-Jochim Group, Inc. (1992) 6
Cal.App.4th 1387, 1392 (“the provisions are now to be liberally construed to
effectuate service and uphold jurisdiction if actual notice has been
received by the defendant, ‘and in the last analysis the question of
service should be resolved by considering each situation from a practical
standpoint. [Citation.]’”) (cleaned up) (internal citations omitted)
(emphasis added).)
Analysis
 
Here, Defendants claim that
Plaintiffs failed to satisfy their burden of proving sufficient facts to
demonstrate effective service on Ms. Kim. According to Plaintiff’s Proof of Service
filed on December 20, 2023, Kim was served by substituted service at the
business address of Greystar California on December 5, 2023. But Ms. Kim claims
that this service was not proper because her employment with Greystar was
terminated on September 18, 2023. (Kim Decl., ¶ 3.) Defendants also submit a
declaration of Norma Urapo, Greystar’s current Payroll Analyst, attesting that Ms.
Kim was terminated on September 18, 2023, that Greystar received a copy of the
Complaint and Summons purporting to serve Ms. Kim on December 5, 2023, and that
Greystar did not accept such service because it was not authorized to. (Urapo
Decl., ¶¶ 2-5.)
 
Plaintiff opposes on the basis that
Code of Civil Procedure § 415.20(b) allows substituted service on a defendant
at their “usual mailing address.” And California Courts have held that the
process statutes should be construed liberally. (See Ellard v. Conway, supra,
94 Cal.App.4th at p. 544; Bein v Brechtel-Jochim Group, Inc., supra, 6
Cal.App.4th at p. 1392.) Plaintiff contends that “[t]he attached declaration
and attached proofs of service reflect that three attempts were made to serve
Defendant at her known address (both before and after the purported date of
employment), and that, on the third occasion, an agent accepted service.”
(Opposition, p. 5:14-17.)
 
Plaintiff’s Reply focus primarily
on the fact that, even if the registered process server’s declaration is
evidence that he performed the service as described, the process server was
still serving Ms. Kim pursuant to Plaintiff’s improper instructions. Further,
no declarations or exhibits were attached to Plaintiff’s opposition, as
Plaintiff improperly stated. 
 
Here, the Court finds that
Plaintiff has not demonstrated adequate facts to establish effective service on
Ms. Kim. The Proof of Service filed with the Court does not show any attempted
service on Ms. Kim before the date of her termination, September 18, 2023. The
first recorded attempt, according to the declaration of diligence, occurred on September
25, 2023. The next attempted date of service on Ms. Kim was November 17, 2023,
nearly two months later. All listed attempts for service were at the same
business address for Greystar. The Court agrees with Defendants’ contention
that the address for a person’s former employer cannot be
considered their “usual place of business” or “usual mailing address” under CCP
§ 415.20(b).
 
Plaintiff’s argument that this
Court should accept substituted service as effective on Ms. Kim is unavailing.
Plaintiffs cites to precedent stating that courts should interpret the service
of process statutes liberally only go so far as to uphold cases where the Defendant
has, as a practical matter, received notice. (See Ellard v. Conway, supra,
94 Cal.App.4th at p. 544; Bein v Brechtel-Jochim Group, Inc., supra, 6
Cal.App.4th at p. 1392.) The facts as alleged, here, are distinguishable
because Ms. Kim never received actual notice from Plaintiff’s service.
 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to
Quash Service of Summons of Defendant Lea Kim is GRANTED.
