Background
 
In this employment action,
Plaintiff Johanna Cobarrubias (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint on January 3,
2022, alleging discrimination, retaliation, failure to provide reasonable
accommodations, failure to engage in a good faith interactive process, wrongful
termination in violation of public policy, and other claims against her former
employer, Defendant Ventura Park Management, LLC (“VPM”). 
 
This action contains a complex
procedural history, as fully set forth below.
 
On July 15, 2022, Defendant VPM
filed its Answer to the Complaint.
 
            Also, on
July 15, 2022, Defendant VPM filed a Cross-Complaint against Kevin Long Ha and
Phuong Pham alleging a cause of action for comparative indemnity/declaratory
relief. 
 
On September 14, 2022, Defendant
VPM requested default against Phuong Pham on the Cross-Complaint, and default
was entered on such date. 
 
On November 16, 2022, Plaintiff
filed an Amendment to Complaint which identified Kevin Long Ha as Doe 1. 
 
On November 16, 2022, Plaintiff
filed an Amendment to Complaint which identified Phong Pham as Doe 2. 
 
On October 24, 2023, Plaintiff
requested default against Phong Pham on the Complaint, and default was entered
on such date. 
 
On October 30, 2023, Defendant VPM
requested default against Kevin Long Ha on the Cross-Complaint, and default was
entered on such date. 
 
On June 4, 2024, Defendant VPM
filed a Proof of Service indicating that the summons, complaint, and
cross-complaint were served on Phuong Pham on June 2, 2024 by substituted
service. 
 
On August 6, 2024, the Court held a
status conference. At the status conference, Plaintiff’s counsel informed the
Court “that the default entered on October 24, 2023, was entered as to the
wrong ‘Phong Pham,’ with the address indicated on the previously filed proof of
service.” (08/06/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) The Court therefore indicated that
“the default entered against defendant Phong Pham is ordered vacated and said
defendant’s name is corrected to reflect ‘Phuong Pham’. (08/06/24 Minute Order
at p. 1.) The Court vacated the default entered on October 24, 2023 as to Phong
Pham. (08/06/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) 
 
Moreover, the Court also vacated
the default entered on September 14, 2022 concerning the Cross-Complaint.
(08/06/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) The Court vacated such default as to Phuong
Pham pursuant to an oral motion by counsel for Defendant VPM. (08/06/24 Minute
Order at p. 1.) “Pursuant to a joint oral motion by plaintiff’s counsel and
counsel for cross-complainant, defaults are entered against Phuong Pham on the
complaint and the cross-complaint, with the address of 1738 44th Avenue, San
Francisco, CA 94122 (as indicated in the proof of service filed on June 04,
2024).” (08/06/24 Minute Order.) 
 
The Court ordered counsel to submit
default packets for entry of judgments no later than October 15, 2024.
(08/06/24 Minute Order at p. 1.) The Court set a hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion
for Determination of Good Faith Settlement (as to Defendant VPM) for September
18, 2024. (08/06/24 Minute Order at p. 2.) 
 
On August 15, 2024, Long Ha (who
indicates that he was erroneously sued as Kevin Long Ha) filed a joint Answer
to the Complaint and the Cross-Complaint. 
 
On August 19, 2024, Plaintiff and
Defendant VPM (collectively, “Settling Parties”) filed and served the instant
Application for Determination of Good Faith Settlement. 
 
On August 23, 2024, Phuong Pham
(“Pham”) filed a Motion to Set Aside and Vacate Default, which is set for
hearing on September 24, 2024.
 
Kevin Long Ha (“Long Ha”) also
filed a Motion to Set Aside and Vacate Default as to the Cross-Complaint, which
is set for hearing on October 1, 2024.
 
On September 18, 2024, the Court
denied the Settling Parties’ application without prejudice on the finding that
the application was not supported with affidavits providing sufficient facts to
determine whether the settlement was a reasonable proportion of the
tortfeasor’s proportionate share of liability, and “not … grossly
disproportionate to what a reasonable person, at the time of settlement, would
estimate the settling defendant’s liability to be.” (Cahill v. San Diego Gas
& Electric Co. (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 939, 959.) The Court also
found that, although Cross-Defendant Pham had submitted an opposition to the
application, Pham lacked standing to oppose the application because he was
still in default.
 
On September 24, 2024, the Court
set aside the default judgment against Cross-Defendant Pham.
 
On October 1, 2024, the Court also
set aside the default judgment against Cross-Defendant Long Ha.
 
On September 30, 2024, the Settling
Parties filed the instant Amended Application for Determination of Good Faith Settlement
between Plaintiff Johanna Cobarrubias and Defendant Venture Park Management,
LLC (collectively, the “Settling Parties”).
 
As of October 17, 2024, the last
day to file an opposition pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1005(b),
neither Cross-Defendant has filed an opposition.
 
Discussion
 
Legal Standard
 
“Any party to an action in which it
is alleged that two or more parties are joint tortfeasors or co-obligors on a
contract debt shall be entitled to a hearing on the issue of the good faith of
a settlement entered into by the plaintiff or other claimant and one or more
alleged tortfeasors or co-obligors, upon giving notice in the manner provided
by subdivision (b) of Section 1005.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6, subd. (a)(1).) 
 
“In the alternative, a settling
party may give notice of settlement to all parties and to the court, together
with an application for determination of good faith settlement and a proposed
order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6, subd. (a)(2).) “The application shall
indicate the settling parties, and the basis, terms, and amount of the
settlement.” (Ibid.) “The notice, application, and proposed order shall
be given by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal service.”
(Ibid.) “Proof of service shall be filed with the court. Within 25 days of the
mailing of the notice, application, and proposed order, or within 20 days of
personal service, a nonsettling party may file a notice of motion to contest
the good faith settlement.” (Ibid.) “If none of the nonsettling parties
files a motion within 25 days of mailing of the notice, application, and
proposed order, or within 20 days of personal service, the court may approve
the settlement.” (Ibid.) 
 
“The issue of the good faith of a
settlement may be determined by the court on the basis of the affidavits served
with the notice of hearing, and any counteraffidavits filed in response, or the
court may, in its discretion, receive other evidence at the hearing.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 877.6, subd. (b).) “A determination by the court that the
settlement was made in good faith shall bar any other joint tortfeasor or
co-obligor from any further claims against the settling tortfeasor or co-obligor
for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative indemnity,
based on comparative negligence or comparative fault.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
877.6, subd. (c).) “The party asserting the lack of good faith shall have the
burden of proof on that issue.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6, subd. (d).) 
 
When determining whether a
settlement was made in good faith, the following factors are considered: (1) a
rough approximation of plaintiff’s total recovery and the settlor’s
proportionate liability; (2) the amount paid in settlement; (3) the allocation
of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs; (4) a recognition that a settlor
should pay less in settlement than he would if he were found liable after a
trial; (5) the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of settling
defendants; and (6) the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct
aimed to injure the interests of the non-settling defendants. (Tech-Bilt,
Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, 499.) 
 
“The ultimate determinant of good
faith is whether the settlement is grossly disproportionate to what a
reasonable person at the time of settlement would estimate the settlor’s
liability to be.” (City of Grand Terrace v. Superior Court (1987) 192
Cal.App.3d 1251, 1262 [citation omitted].) “[A] good faith settlement does not
call for perfect or even nearly perfect apportionment of liability.” (Abbott
Ford, Inc. v. Superior Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d 858, 875 [internal quotations
omitted].) “[O]nly when the good faith nature of a settlement is disputed, it
is incumbent upon the trial court to consider and weigh the Tech-Bilt
factors.” (City of Grand Terrace v. Superior Court, supra, 192
Cal.App.3d 1251, 1261.) “That is to say, when no one objects, the barebones
motion which sets forth the ground of good faith, accompanied by a declaration
which sets forth a brief background of the case is sufficient.” (Ibid.)
 
Analysis
 
            Here, the
Court finds that the Settling Parties have submitted sufficient facts in
support of their Amended Motion for Determination of Good Faith Settlement to
establish that the settlement agreement was entered in good faith, and that its
terms are reasonable. 
 
The Settling Parties contend that
there is a presumption of fairness with the instant application for settlement
because the Settling Parties reached the settlement agreement through
arm’s-length negotiations in the presence of an experienced mediator. (Guardado
Decl., ¶¶ 10, 18; Wershba v. Apple Computer, Inc. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th
224, 245.)
 
The Settling Parties further
contend that their settlement agreement meets the standards set by the Tech-Bilt
factors, as set forth above in the legal standards section. (Tech-Bilt, Inc.,
supra, 38 Cal.3d 488 at p. 499.)
 
The Settling Parties primarily rely
on the following assertions, matched to the Tech-Bilt factors:
1)   
The settlement agreement for $75,000.00 is
proportionate to Defendant’s potential liability. If Plaintiff is successful at
trial, her claims would typically result in jury awards of $500,000 to
$1,000,000. Defendant contends that it is not liable for any of Plaintiff’s
damages because, at the time of injury, Cross-Defendants Pham and Ha owned
Defendant’s business. The parties agreed to settle, rather than litigate this
dispute, to avoid unnecessary attorneys’ fees and costs.
2)   
The amount entered for settlement is $75,000.
3)   
There is no apportionment of damages between multiple
plaintiffs because Plaintiff is the only Plaintiff.
4)   
The recovery is not “far out of the ballpark.” It is
unknown if the settlement amount of $75,000 would be less that Plaintiff’s
possible recovery against Defendant, but the settlement allows Plaintiff to
recover substantial compensation while avoiding the risks and costs of
litigation. 
5)   
All of the settlement funds are coming straight from
Defendant, there is no applicable insurance policy.
6)   
The terms of the settlement agreement are presumptively
fair because they were negotiated at arm’s length under the guidance of an
experienced mediator, Hon. Richard Stone (ret.). There is no evidence of
collusion or bad faith.
(Guardado Decl., ¶ 18.)
 
The Court finds that facts,
supported by the verified declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel, establish that
the settlement offer was entered in good faith and that its terms are
reasonable. Finding no opposition from either Cross-Defendant, the Court find
no basis for objection to the reasonableness of the Settling Parties’
agreement.
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the
Amended Application for Determination of Good Faith Settlement between Johanna
Cobarrubias and Ventura Park Management, LLC.
