And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the validity of substituted service in a case. The defendant does not dispute that substituted service was permissible, but argues that the process server's attempts at personal service were insufficient. However, the judge finds that the process server made four attempts at personal service, which satisfies the requirement of "reasonable diligence" under California law. The judge also rejects the defendant's arguments citing other cases, finding that they are inapposite or misapply the law. The judge orders the defendant to appear in court on January 30, 2024, to compare the individual in the proof of service and the defendant.
