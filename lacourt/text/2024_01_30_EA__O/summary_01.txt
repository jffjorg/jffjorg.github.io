Summary in English text:

The judge has denied the Defendant's motion to set aside the default and default judgment. The Defendant, Ven-Chee Koh dba Win Way Academy, alleged that the proof of service was fraudulent and that he did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit. The judge found that the Defendant failed to provide sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption that service was proper. The judge also questioned the Defendant's credibility based on conflicting statements and evidence. The motion was filed under CCP Section 473.5, which allows a party to set aside a default or default judgment if they can show that they did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit. The judge found that the Defendant's motion was timely, but that the second prong of the statute, which requires the Defendant to show that their lack of actual notice was not caused by their avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect, was not satisfied.
