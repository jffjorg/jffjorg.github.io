Defendant does not dispute that substituted service was permissible. Here, even
assuming it was disputed, the process server’s declaration indicates that
personal service (i.e., at Defendant’s home) was attempted four times
(4/4/23 at 8:02 PM, 4/5/23 at 9:13 AM, 4/6/23 at 2:04 PM, and 4/7/23 at 5:46
PM). “Ordinarily,
... two or three attempts at personal service at a proper place should fully satisfy
the requirement of reasonable diligence and allow
substituted service to
be made.” (Espindola v. Nunez (1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 1389, 1392,
quoting Note, Substituted Service of Process on Individuals: Code of Civil Procedure Section 415.20(b), supra, 21 Hastings L.J. at p. 1277.) Therefore,
with four attempts, the ‘reasonable diligence’ is satisfied. The process
server, John Baldwin, will be available during the 1/30/2024 hearing to provide
further clarity on the service of process. (See Baldwin Decl., ¶6.) 


[2] The facts of Bein are inapposite because it involved
the issue of whether a gate guard of a gated community constitutes as a
competent member of the household (§ 415.20, subd. (b)). (Id. at
p. 1392.) 
 


[3] See Goya v. P.E.R.U Enterprises (1978) 87
Cal.App.3d 886, 893 [“[C]ourt [] invested with the discretion to set aside the
default and default judgment.”].)


[4] Defendant also cites to Bolkiah v. Superior Court (1999)
74 Cal.App.4th 984 for its proposition that the plaintiff must prove by a
preponderance of the evidence that service is valid until there is an
evidentiary hearing. (Motion p. 5.) But that language from Bolkiah involved
the issue of whether service was made according to the requirements of the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act, not whether service complied with California
law. Thus, reliance on the case is misplaced. 
 


[5] (And as Defendant avers that few people occasionally
visit in contrast to many people consistently visiting, it is
reasonable to assume that Defendant would be able to recall who was visiting
him or spending the night.)
 


[6] And in Zara, the appellate court held that the
POS on its face was untruthful because the POS described a man with different colored
hair and of different ethnicity than defendant. 
(Id. p. 390; see also fn. 2 [“In addition to defendant's
declaration that the description did not fit, the trial court and plaintiff did
not contradict this aspect of defendant's declaration when they saw defendant
at the motion hearing.”].) Here too the court is compelled to order Defendant’s
appearance in court to compare the individual in the POS and Defendant.  
 


[7] Additionally, the affidavit is untimely and should
have been raised in Reply.
