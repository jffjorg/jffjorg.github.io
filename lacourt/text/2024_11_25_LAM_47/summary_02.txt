Vanessa Navarro, et al., granting the Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production and Form Interrogatories propounded on Defendant LA Immigration Center, LLC. The Plaintiff had requested that the Defendant provide verified, code-compliant responses to the discovery requests without objections within 30 days.

The Judge found that the Plaintiff's fee request was unreasonably inflated and that any sanctions would be unjust under the circumstances.
