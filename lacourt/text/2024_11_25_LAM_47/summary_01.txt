```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the motions of Defendants Revital Agi and Eydan Berger to compel further responses to special interrogatories. The Court finds that the motions were served improperly by electronic service, which is only authorized with the consent of the party to be served. Since no consent was filed, the service was improper and the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the motions. The Court also notes that the parties had agreed to extend the time to move to compel further responses, but the motion was still served after the agreed-upon deadline. As a result, the Court denies the motions for lack of jurisdiction.
