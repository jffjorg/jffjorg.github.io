Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to strike the allegations in support of and claim for punitive damages in the first amended complaint. The motion was filed by the defendant, Bernard Feinstein, who challenges the claim for punitive damages based on a lack of showing of malicious or oppressive conduct. The plaintiff, Danielle Love, argued that the retaliation claim allows for punitive damages as a matter of law, but the court found that the motion specifically challenges the factual sufficiency of the retaliation claim for purposes of meeting the punitive damages threshold. The court also noted that the language of the statute requires acknowledgment of "fraud, oppression, or malice with respect to that act" of retaliation, and that the alleged circumstances demonstrate a reckless disregard for the plaintiff's rights and safety or oppressive conditions within the plain language of the statute. The court denied the motion to strike and ordered the defendant to answer the complaint within 10 days and give notice.
