Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to strike the allegations in support of and claim for punitive damages in the first amended complaint. The motion was filed by the defendant, Bernard Feinstein, who challenges the claim for punitive damages based on a lack of showing of malicious or oppressive conduct. The plaintiff, Danielle Love, argued that the retaliation claim allows for punitive damages as a matter of law, but the court found that the motion specifically challenges the factual sufficiency of the retaliation claim for purposes of meeting the punitive damages threshold. The court also noted that the language of the statute requires acknowledgment of "fraud, oppression, or malice with respect to that act" of retaliation, and that the alleged circumstances demonstrate a reckless disregard for the plaintiff's rights and safety or oppressive conditions within the plain language of the statute. The court denied the motion to strike and ordered the defendant to answer the complaint within 10 days and give notice.

In this case, Plaintiff Danielle Love alleges that Defendant Bernard Feinstein retaliated against her by serving her with a 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit after she complained about a persistent water leak in her rental unit.  

Defendant moved to strike Love's request for punitive damages, arguing that Love didn't provide enough evidence of malicious or oppressive conduct.  The Judge denied the motion, finding that the allegations in Love's complaint, particularly the length of the disrepair and the timing of the 3-Day Notice, suggest a reckless disregard for Love's rights and safety, satisfying the legal requirements for punitive damages in this specific situation.

## Case Summary: 

**Case Number:** 22CHCV01531
**Plaintiff:** Danielle Love
**Defendant:** Bernard Feinstein
**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023
**Dept:** F49

**Summary:**

This case involves a landlord-tenant dispute. Plaintiff Danielle Love alleges that Defendant Bernard Feinstein, her landlord, failed to repair a water leak in her rented premises, violating her implied warranty of habitability and causing unsafe living conditions. 

Love reported the leak to the City of Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety and the Los Angeles County Department of Health, leading to a citation against Defendant.  Love then alleges Defendant retaliated against her by serving her with a 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit. Love claims she successfully applied for COVID rent relief and remains in the premises.

Love filed a complaint for Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability, Negligence, Breach of Contract, Violation of Civil Code Section 1942.4, and Retaliation (Civil Code Section 1942.5).  

**Defendant's Motion:**

Defendant moved to strike the allegations in support of punitive damages in the retaliation claim, arguing that Love failed to demonstrate malicious or oppressive conduct.

**Judge's Ruling:**

The Judge denied Defendant's motion. 

**Reasoning:**

* While acknowledging the late filing of Plaintiff's opposition, the court found the allegations sufficiently plead a claim for punitive damages under Civil Code Section 1942.5, which allows for such damages in retaliation cases involving fraud, oppression, or malice.
* The court noted that the statutory framework for punitive damages in this context is distinct from the general standards under Civil Code Sections 3294 and 3295.
* The court found the alleged circumstances, including the prolonged disrepair, denial of notice, and retaliatory action after Love sought remedies, demonstrated a reckless disregard for her rights and safety, potentially amounting to "oppressive conditions" under the statute.


**Next Steps:**

Defendant is ordered to answer the complaint within 10 days.

Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's claim for punitive damages in the first amended complaint. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant retaliated against them by serving a three-day notice to pay rent or quit after the plaintiff filed complaints with local government agencies regarding the condition of the premises. The defendant argues that the claim for punitive damages lacks factual support and that the plaintiff has not shown any evidence of malicious or oppressive conduct.

The court disagrees with the defendant's argument, finding that the alleged circumstances demonstrate a reckless disregard for the rights and safety of the plaintiff and/or oppressive conditions within the plain language of the statute. The court also notes that the motion to strike is untimely and that the plaintiff has not been prejudiced by the late filing of the opposition.

The court grants the motion to answer the complaint within 10 days and orders the defendant to give notice. The court denies the motion to strike the punitive damages claim, and the case will proceed to trial.

**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023
**Dept:** F49 Dept. F-49

**Parties:**

* Plaintiff: Danielle Love
* Defendant: Bernard Feinstein

**Summary:**

On December 5, 2018, Danielle Love entered into a two-year lease with Bernard Feinstein for certain premises. In December 2020, Love notified Feinstein of a water leak, but no repairs were made. Love reported the leak to the City of Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety and filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Department of Health. Following this, Love was served with a 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit the premises on January 25, 2022. Love claims to have successfully applied for covid rent relief and continues to reside at the premises. Love filed a complaint for Breach of Implied Warranty of Habitability, Negligence, Breach of Contract, Violation of Civil Code section 1942.4, and Retaliation (Civil Code section 1942.5) on December 30, 2022. Feinstein answered the complaint on April 17, 2023, and Love filed a first amended complaint on April 19, 2023.

**Ruling:**

Feinstein's motion to strike the allegations in support of, and claim for, punitive damages in the first amended complaint, as pled in the retaliation cause of action, is denied. The court finds the alleged circumstances demonstrate a reckless disregard for the rights and safety of Love and/or oppressive conditions within the plain language of the statute. The motion to strike is denied, and Feinstein is required to answer the complaint within 10 days.
