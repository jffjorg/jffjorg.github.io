(“ACA”) and Damian Akhavi (“Akhavi”) (“Cross Defendants”) in order to add a

§45.33 based on the same operative facts asserted in the prior pleadings; and delete

which claim has been withdrawn.  (Notice
of Motion, pg. 2.)
          
          Procedural
Background
          On
December 15, 2016, Plaintiff filed its complaint against Defendant Myron
Holmstrom (“Holmstrom”) and DOES 1-200, alleging causes of action for (1)
declaratory relief, (2) rescission and restitution, (3) ejectment, (4)
trespass, (5) breach of fiduciary duty, (6) false promise, (7) concealment, (8)
intentional misrepresentation, (9) intentional interference with contractual
relations, (10) breach of contract, (11) professional negligence, and (12)
Business and Profession Code §17200, in which the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and
12th causes of action were asserted against all Defendants, the 1st,
2nd, and 3rd causes of action were asserted against all Defendants except DOES
1-100, the 10th cause of action was asserted only against Holmstrom, and the
9th cause of action was asserted against all Defendants except Holmstrom.  Plaintiff thereafter filed numerous DOE
Amendments to the complaint, as well as requests for dismissals of certain
causes of action against Holmstrom and certain DOE Defendants.  Plaintiff’s complaint is based on allegations
that Rita Seifer (“Seifer”), who owned certain real property buildings which
share a border and are located at 540 Glenrock Avenue (“Glenrock Property”) and
543 Landfair Avenue (“Landfair Property”) (collectively “Buildings”) prior to
Plaintiff’s purchase of them, assigned her claims against Holmstrom (the
Buildings’ property manager) and his alleged co-conspirators (the tenants of
the Buildings, moving Defendants) to Plaintiff in an assignment dated December
12, 2016 (“Assignment”), and that Holmstrom allegedly engaged in a scheme
whereby he would charge tenants less than market rent, retain half of the rent,
and send the remainder to Seifer as landlord. 

          On April 19, 2018, DOES 101-105 filed
a cross-complaint against Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant Akhavi (collectively,
“Cross-Defendants”).  On April 20, 2018,
DOES 101-105 filed a first amended cross-complaint (“FACC”).  On August 9, 2018, J. Caldera, Yavuz Ertas,
Larousse, Luigi, Lebiba, Nadia, Ali Razfar, and N. Razfar (collectively, “DOES
112-118, 121”) filed a complaint against Cross-Defendants in a separate action,
Case No. BC717036, alleging the same four causes of action as in the FACC.  On February 11, 2020, the Court ordered the instant
action and BC717036 consolidated.  On
March 27, 2020, DOES 101-105 filed a second amended cross-complaint (“SACC”)
alleging the same four causes of action against Cross-Defendants.  On September 14, 2020, the Court granted
Oyunchimeg’s ex parte application for leave to file a third amended
cross-complaint (“TACC”) to include DOE Defendant names inadvertently omitted
from the SACC.  The TACC was thereafter
filed on September 15, 2020. 
          On September 11, 2020, the Court
granted the motion for summary adjudication brought by DOES 101-105 as to
Issues Nos. 2-7 and denied the motion as to Issues Nos. 1 and 8.  Accordingly, the Court granted DOES 101-105’s
motion for summary adjudication as to the original complaint’s 1st, 3rd,
4th, 9th, 11th, and 12th causes of action, while the 2nd and 5th causes of
action remained in the operative pleading. 
On December 10, 2020, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for leave to
file an amended verified complaint in part.  Specifically, the Court granted Plaintiff
leave to amend the 1st (declaratory relief), 4th (trespass), 5th (breach of
fiduciary duty), 6th (false promise), 11th (professional negligence), and 12th
(Section 17200) causes of action and denied leave to amend as to the 2nd
(recission and restitution), 3rd (ejectment), 7th (concealment), 8th
(intentional misrepresentation), 9th (intentional interference with contractual
relations), and 10th (breach of contract) causes of action.  
          On January 7, 2021, Plaintiff filed
its first amended complaint (“FAC”) alleging the following causes of action:
(1) declaratory relief [as to all Defendants except DOES 1-100]; (2)
ejectment [as to all Defendants except DOES 101-105], (3) trespass [as
to all Defendants except DOES 101-105], (4) breach of fiduciary duty [as
to all Defendants], (5) intentional interference with contractual relations [as
to all Defendants except DOES 101-105], (6) declaratory relief (in the
alternative) [as to all Defendants], (7) breach of contract (in the
alternative) [as to all Defendants], and (8) declaratory relief (in the
alternative) [as to all Defendants].  On
May 13, 2021, the Court overruled Defendants’ demurrer to the FAC’s 1st and 6th
causes of action and sustained the demurrer as to the 7th cause of action (with
leave to amend) and 8th cause of action (without leave to amend).  
On June
2, 2021, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint (“SAC”) alleging the
following causes of action: (1) declaratory relief [as to all Defendants except
DOES 1-100]; (2) ejectment [as to all Defendants except P. Caldera, Mian
Guo, Jia Shen, Yunying Li, and Min Zhou (collectively, “DOES 101-105”)], (3)
trespass [as to all Defendants except DOES 101-105], (4) aiding and
abetting breach of fiduciary duty [as to all Defendants], (5) intentional
interference with contractual relations [as to all Defendants except DOES
101-105], (6) declaratory relief (in the alternative) [as to all Defendants],
and (7) breach of contract (in the alternative) [as to all Defendants].  
          On October 24, 2022, this Court denied
Defendants’ motion for summary judgment and granted Defendants’ motion for
summary adjudication as to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th causes of action and
as to Issues Nos. 2, 5, and 6, and denied summary adjudication as to the 6th
and 7th causes of action and as to Issue No. 7. 
This Court did not reach Issue Nos. 1, 3, or 4.
          On February 15, 2023, this Court ruled
on Defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings, denying the motion as to
the 6th and 7th causes of action.
          On August 7,
2023, this Court held a trial on the 6th cause of action for declaratory
relief.
Prior to
the trial on the 6th Cause of Action, Plaintiff dismissed the 6th cause of
action against Ming Guo, Jia Shen, Yunying Li, Yavuz Ertas, Ali Razfar, and
Ganchimeg Oyunchimeg (collectively, “Dismissed Defendants”).  In light of the dismissal, the Court made no
findings as to the nature of the Dismissed Defendants’ tenancies.  
          On December 1, 2023, this Court ruled
on Defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings of Plaintiff’s 7th cause of
action, granting the motion as to the Dismissed Defendants, and denying the
motion as to the Moving Defendants.
          On March 20, 2024, Moving Parties
filed the instant motion.  On May 17,
2024, Cross-Defendants/Plaintiff filed its opposition.  On May 21, 2024, Moving Parties filed their
reply.
 
          Motion for Leave to Amend
“The
court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow
a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name
of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake
in any other respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or
demurrer. The court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the
adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any
pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms allow an
answer to be made after the time limited by this code.”  (C.C.P.
§473(a)(1).) 
“Trial
courts are vested with the discretion to allow amendments to pleadings ‘in
furtherance of justice.’ That trial courts are to liberally permit such
amendments, at any stage of the proceeding, has been established policy in this
state since 1901.”  (Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d
486, 488-489.) 
CRC
Rule 3.1321(a) requires that a motion to amend must: “[i]nclude a copy of the
proposed . . . amended pleading . . . [and] state what allegations in the
previous pleading are proposed to be [deleted and/or added], if any, and where,
by page, paragraph, and line number, the [deleted and/or additional] allegations
are located.” 
CRC
Rule 3.1324(b) provides, as follows: “[a] separate declaration must accompany
the motion and must specify: (1) [t]he effect of the amendment; (2) [w]hy the
amendment is necessary and proper; (3) [w]hen the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered; and (4) [t]he reasons why the request for
amendment was not made earlier.” 
Moving
Parties’ motion substantially complies with CRC Rule 3.1324(a).  The
motion includes copies of the proposed FAC and 4ACC.  (Decl. of Riley ¶13,
Exhs. 3-4.)   Moving Parties’ counsel’s declaration sets
forth the allegations proposed to be added and deleted, and where, by page,
paragraph, and line number, and attaches redlined copies of the proposed
pleadings.  (Decl. of Riley ¶11, Exhs. 1-2.) 
Moving
Parties’ motion substantially complies with CRC Rule 3.1324(b).  Moving Parties submitted a separate
declaration of their counsel that specifies the effect of the amendments and
explains why the amendments are necessary and proper.  (Decl. of Riley ¶¶5-9.) 
Moving Parties assert the amendments are necessary because wish to add a new
legal theory based on a new provision of the Los Angeles Municipal Code for
Tenant Harassment §45.35, which did not become effective until August 6, 2021. 
(Decl. of Riley ¶5.)
Moving
Parties’ counsel states when the facts giving rise of the amended allegations
were discovered and why the request for amendment was not made earlier.  Moving Parties’ counsel declares, “Amendment
was not sought earlier for a number of reasons. First, when the ordinance was
first enacted, counsel was not made immediately aware of it. Second, in 2022,
counsel for Moving Parties was mired in motions for summary adjudication. Trial
had been set for May 31, 2022, but was continued over Moving Party’s objections.
In an April 13, 2022 order, discovery and all other pretrial deadlines were to
be calculated based on the May 31st date. As such, discovery was closed since
April 30, 2022. Thereafter, the former judge retired and trial was further
delayed.”  (Decl. of Riley ¶7.)  Moving Parties’ counsel further declares, “ACA
in the meantime shifted strategy and changed the factual grounds for its’
breach of contract claim on the eve of a bench trial on ACA’s declaratory
relief claim. ACA withdrew most of the alleged grounds stated for declaratory
relief and for the first time took the position that the tenancies were based
on the tenant estoppels and pre-existing written leases that ACA had previously
alleged were fraudulent. In conjunction with ACA’s change of its’ factual
position, on May 22, 2023, ACA unilaterally deposited over 6 years of
previously tendered but rejected tenant estoppel rent and took the new position
that the breach of contract claim contemplated a failure to pay the tenant
estoppel rent based on checks that were returned in May 2023, two years after
the filing of the Second Amended Complaint. The court permitted ACA to change
the factual underpinnings of the claim asserting it was implied within the
prior pleadings. The court did not require ACA to file an amended complaint.”  (Decl. of Riley ¶8.)
Cross-Defendants’
argument that Plaintiff’s proposed amendment is does not offer corrections or
clarity to the resolution of the pending action is unavailing.  The policy favoring amendment is so strong
that denial of leave to amend can rarely be justified: “If the motion to amend
is timely made and the granting of the motion will not prejudice the opposing
party, it is error to refuse permission to amend and where the refusal also
results in a party being deprived of the right to assert a meritorious cause of
action or a meritorious defense, it is not only error but an abuse of
discretion.”  (Morgan v. Superior Court
(1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530.)
It
is improper for this Court to consider the validity of the proposed amended
pleading on the instant motion; after leave to amend is granted, Cross-Defendants
will have the opportunity to attack the validity of the amended pleading.  (See Kittredge
Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045,
1048; Atkinson v. Elk Corp.
(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 760 [“[T]he better course of action would have been
to allow [plaintiff] to amend the complaint and then let the parties test its
legal sufficiency in other appropriate proceedings”].)
Cross-Defendants’
argument that they will be prejudiced if this Court grants the instant motion
is noted, but not sufficient to overcome the policy of liberality in permitting
amendments to the complaint at “any stage of the proceedings, up to and
including trial,” absent prejudice to the adverse party.  (Atkinson, 109
Cal.App.4th at pg. 761.)  Prejudice
exists where the amendment would result in a delay of trial, along with loss of
critical evidence, added costs of preparation, increased burden of discovery,
etc.  (Magpali v. Farmers Group, Inc.
(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488; see P & D Consultants, Inc. v. City
of Carlsbad (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1345; Fisher v. Larsen
(1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 627, 649, [leave to amend properly denied where P knew
for over five months claims had not been properly pleaded and took no action to
amend until after summary judgment granted against it].)  Here, Cross-Defendants do not dispute they
have been on notice of the alleged underlying conduct related to violation of
the Tenant Harassment Ordinance as well as their exposure to civil penalties
associated with such conduct; therefore, there is no element of surprise.
Finally,
Cross-Defendants’ contention that a continuance of trial would be required and
there would be an increase in discovery and expense, is not supported by
evidence.  Cross-Defendants do not
identify any additional discovery they would need that could not have or would
not have a reason to conduct during the 7+ year litigation, nor do Cross-Defendants
explain why a continuance of any length would be required. To the contrary, Cross-Defendants
concede the claim based on the Tenant Harassment Ordinance is predicated on the
same course of conduct as the previously alleged claims for retaliation, LAMC
§151.04-06 and Intentional Influence to Vacate.
Based
on the foregoing, Moving Parties’ motion for leave to file a First Amended
Complaint and a Fourth Amended Cross-Complaint is granted.  
 
          Conclusion
Moving
Parties’ motion for file a First Amended Complaint and a
Fourth Amended Cross-Complaint. 
Moving Parties may file the proposed FAC and 4ACC with the Court.
          Moving Party to give notice.
