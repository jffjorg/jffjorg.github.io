And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary adjudication as to the first and third causes of action in the plaintiff's second amended complaint. The first cause of action is for medical battery, and the judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to create a triable issue of material fact as to whether the defendant intentionally violated any condition placed on the plaintiff's consent. The judge notes that the plaintiff was informed that Allergan silicone implants would be used, and she initialed later pages of the consent form referencing silicone implants. The third cause of action is for fraud, and the judge finds that the defendant did not intend to deceive the plaintiff, and the plaintiff was informed that Allergan implants would be used and the warranty would not apply. The judge also finds that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence that she provided no consent to the procedure and that the defendant intentionally violated any condition placed on the plaintiff's consent.
