And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel arbitration and stay the proceeding. The plaintiff, Conquest Construction Management, Inc. dba Reside Custom Homes, seeks to compel the defendant, Sofia Vergara and Luis Balaguer, as Trustee of the Casa Bellagio Trust, to submit to arbitration of the plaintiff's claims. The parties agree that the written agreement underlying this action provides for arbitration. The judge finds that the agreement to arbitrate exists and that the plaintiff's claims are covered by the agreement. The burden shifts to the opposing party to prove a defense to enforcement of the agreement. Since the parties do not oppose submitting this action to arbitration, the judge grants the motion and stays the proceeding pending the outcome of arbitration.
