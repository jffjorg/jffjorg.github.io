And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant ADP, LLC's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication on all claims except for punitive damages, which is also denied. The judge finds that there are triable issues of fact regarding the claims for fraud, breach of oral contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, quasi-contract, and violation of the Independent Wholesale Sales Representative Act.

The judge finds that Defendant's objections to Plaintiff's declaration are overruled, and that Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to create a triable issue of fact regarding the claims for fraud and breach of contract. The judge also finds that Defendant's failure to enter into a written contract with Plaintiff creates a triable issue of fact regarding the claim for violation of the Independent Wholesale Sales Representative Act.

The judge notes that the purpose of summary judgment is to determine whether trial is necessary to resolve the dispute, and that a court need only rule on those objections to evidence that are material to its disposition of the motion. The judge also notes that the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.

The judge's ruling is tentative and is subject to change based on further arguments and evidence presented at the hearing.

Plaintiff asserts that Defendant made misrepresentations and that she justifiably relied on them. Defendant argues that there were no misrepresentations and that Plaintiff was informed of the commission calculations for her position as an independent Regional Sales Manager. The court rules that these disputes create triable issues of material fact.
