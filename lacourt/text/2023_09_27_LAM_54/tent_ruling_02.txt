Hearing Date: September 27, 2023
Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
Motion for Terminating Sanctions
Moving Party: Plaintiff Shangri-La Construction,
L.P.
Responding Party: None
 
T/R:    PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS IS GRANTED.
 
PLAINTIFF TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please email the
courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing
counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received. 
 
It is a misuse of the discovery process
to fail “to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery,” (CCP §
2023.010(d)) or to disobey “a court order to provide discovery.”  (CCP § 2023.010(g).)  Under CCP § 2023.030, courts have the
authority to issue monetary sanctions, evidentiary sanctions, or terminating
sanctions after giving parties proper notice and the opportunity to be heard.
 
In determining whether sanctions should
be imposed, courts consider the totality of the circumstances, including the
“conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment
to the propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to
obtain the discovery.”  (Lang v.
Hochman (2000) 77 Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1246.)   “The penalty should be appropriate to the
dereliction, and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.”  (Wilson v. Jefferson (1985) 163 Cal.
App. 3d 952, 959.)
 
Plaintiff moves for terminating
sanctions against Defendant Streamline Integration on the ground that Defendant
has failed to comply with Court’s discovery orders. On August 4, 2023, the
Court granted Plaintiff’s five motions to compel discovery responses and pay
sanctions, and ordered Defendant to provide responses within 15 days. Defendant
has not produced responses or paid sanctions.
 
This action has been pending for more
than a year. Defendant has failed to respond to Plaintiff’s basic discovery
requests. Defendant did not oppose Plaintiff’s discovery motions or appear at
the hearing. Defendant failed to comply with the Court’s August 4, 2023 order
and has not opposed this motion. The Court finds that terminating sanctions are
appropriate. 
 
Plaintiff’s motion for terminating
sanctions is GRANTED.
