  Case Number:  23STCP04410    Hearing Date:   May 28, 2024    Dept:  85 
 
Fix the City, Inc., et al. v. City of Los Angeles,
et al., 23STCP04410

 
Tentative decision on (1) demurrer: mostly sustained;
(2) motion to strike: mostly denied



 
 
Respondent City of Los Angeles (“City”) demurs to the First
Amended Petition (“FAP”) for writ of mandate filed by Petitioner Fix the City,
Inc. (“FTC”).  The City separately moves
to strike portions of the FAP.
The court has read and considered the moving papers, oppositions,
and replies, and renders the following tentative decision. 
 
I. Statement of
the Case
Petitioner FTC commenced this proceeding on December 5,
2023.  On February 23, 2024, FTC filed
the FAP, the operative pleading, which alleges ten causes of action for declaratory
relief and/or mandamus.  The verified FAP
alleges in pertinent part as follows. 
 
A. Pertinent
Facts
As a California non-profit public benefit corporation, FTC’s
mission is to promote public safety, support adequate infrastructure, and hold
City government accountable on land use issues. 
FAP, ¶36.
The Midvale Project (sometimes, “Project”) is a
“low-barrier” interim housing project using 8 x 8 prefab plastic units to
provide 33 sleeping cabins, on-site laundry facilities, storage bins and a
storage module, pet area, office/case management conferencing space, dining
area/community space, security fencing, additional “wrap-around” services, and
two staff parking spaces, but without state-mandated “safe parking” for
unhoused individuals.  FAP, ¶8.
Low-barrier shelters are part of the City’s strategy to
address homelessness.  They are designed
to be accessible to as many homeless individuals as possible, including the
following: persons without identification or proof of homelessness; individuals
under the influence of alcohol or drugs, provided they do not pose a danger to
themselves or others; people with mental health issues who might not be able to
comply with more stringent shelter rules; and homeless individuals with
pets.   FAP, p. 2, n.1.  
The term “low-barrier navigation center” means a Housing
First, low-barrier, service-enriched shelter that provides temporary living
facilities while case managers connect individuals experiencing homelessness to
income, public benefits, health services, shelter, and permanent housing.  Government (“Govt.”) Code §65660(a); FAP, p.
2, n.1.
The Project site is Los Angeles Special Revenue Parking Fund
(“SPRF”) City Parking Lot 707, encompassing two parcels.  FAP, ¶124. 
The Project site is approximately 16,860 square feet and is two small
parcels bisected by a public alley, with frontages along Pico Boulevard and
Midvale Avenue.  Parcel 2, north of the
alley, is zoned R1 for single-family residential only.  Parcel 2 abuts single-family homes to the
east, west, and north. FAP, ¶10.  Parcel
1, south of the alley, is zoned NMU(EC)-POD for mixed- and multi-family use.  The Project site is the only off-street
parking facility for the nearby businesses and provides the only Americans with
Disability Act (“ADA”) parking for those businesses. FAP, ¶9.
On July 24, 2023, Council District 5 (“CD 5”) announced the
Project after site selection had been completed, and after a vendor and
provider had already been selected by the Councilmember. Unlike other homeless
projects, the Project failed to abide by the required processes – namely, there
had been no Project application, no prior City Council file, no City Council
motion to initiate the Project, no City Administrative Office (“CAO”) site
assessment using established criteria, and no Asset Management Assessment.  FAP, ¶11.
On August 10, 2023, the Los Angeles Board of Transportation
Commissioners (“Transportation Board”) held an informational session on the
Project that did not provide the public with a staff report. The Transportation
Board took no action at the informational session.  FAP, ¶12.
On September 29, 2023, the City’s Department of Public
Works, Bureau of Engineering (“BOE”), issued a CEQA exemption report. FAP, ¶13.
On September 29, 2023, the CAO issued a report recommending
the use of the lot for modular interim housing and partial funding for the
Project, but only for site preparation and development of modular units, not
for operation expense or restoration of the parking lot.  FAP, ¶14.
On October 4, 2023, the Los Angeles Housing and Homeless
Commission (“Homeless Commission”) held a public hearing to approve Project
funding for the purchase of the sleeping huts. There was no staff report from the
City’s Housing or General Services Departments, or site suitability report from
the CAO.  FAP, ¶15.
On October 10, 2023, the Governor signed AB 785 into law,
which replaced Public Resources (“Pub. Res.”) Code section 21080.27 (“section
21080.27”).  The new section 21080.27
took effect on January 1, 2024.  Even
though the City was a co-sponsor of AB 785, the City failed to make the new
required findings for AB 785 with respect to the Project.  FAP, ¶16.
On October 12, 2023, the Transportation Board held a public
hearing on the Project.  The Transportation
Board President continued the item to October 18 due to lack of information on
the Project.  Four days later, the Mayor
fired the President, although she had just reappointed him a month earlier.  FAP, ¶18.
On October 18, 2023, the Transportation Board held a public
hearing on the Project and approved use of Lot 707 for the Project.  The Transportation Board found the Project
statutorily exempt under the California Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”) as
an action necessary to prevent or mitigate an emergency under Pub. Res. Code section
21080(b)(4) and CEQA Guidelines section 15269(c), as well as under Pub. Res.
Code section 21080.27 (then AB 1179). No staff report was presented or
distributed to those members of the public who attended the hearing.  FAP, ¶20.
The Transportation Board report for October 18, 2023 was not
presented publicly. Neither the actions taken by the Homeless Commission, nor
the Transportation Board report, were presented to the City Council. The Homeless
Commission report disclosed additional costs that were not included in the CAO
partial funding report, including a loss of $530,000 in revenue over ten years for
the Special Parking Revenue Fund, the surplus of which is transferred to the
General Fund. As a result, the CAO’s report was incomplete and incorrect
regarding impacts on the General Fund under City Financial Policy 32.  FAP, ¶21.
Regarding the exemption claimed under Pub. Res. Code section
21080(b)(4), CEQA defines an emergency as “a sudden, unexpected occurrence,
involving a clear and imminent danger, demanding immediate action to prevent or
mitigate loss of, or damage to, life, health, property, or essential public
services. Pub. Res. Code §21060.3.  “Emergencies”
are defined as occurrences such as fire, flood, earthquake, landslide, riot,
accident or sabotage.  Id. This exemption
only applies to a sudden, unexpected occurrence.  FAP, ¶22.
Pursuant to section 21080.27, effective January 1, 2024,
CEQA does not apply to projects shown to be “activities undertaken by the City
of Los Angeles within the City of Los Angeles” that include the “issuance of an
entitlement for, or the approval of the construction of, an affordable housing
project, a low-barrier navigation center, a supportive housing project, or a
transitional housing project for youth and young adults.” §21080.27(b)(1). Per
the Legislative Digest: “The bill would require the lead agency to ensure that
those projects meet certain labor requirements in order for the exemption to
apply.”  See also §21080.27(e).  FAP, ¶23.
On October 20, 2023, the City Council approved the use of
Lot 707 for a low-barrier interim housing project, partial funding for the
Project, and found the Project statutorily exempt under CEQA as an action
necessary to prevent or mitigate an emergency under Pub. Res. Code section
21080(b)(4) and CEQA Guidelines section 15269(c), and also under section
21080.27 (then AB 1179).  FAP, ¶24.  
On November 1, 2023, the issued a CEQA Notice of Exemption (“NOE”),
citing the same provisions.  FAP, ¶25.
 
B. Approval of the Project 
There was no staff report, in writing or orally, responding
to the objections raised by FTC and the public at the City Council’s Housing
and Homelessness Committee meeting on October 4, 2023, the Transportation Board
meetings of August 10, October 12, and October 18, 2023, or the City Council meeting
on October 20, 2023. There was no Project application citing the authority to
build the Project or the need for discretionary approvals. There was no
discussion in any Project document addressing the violation of the Mayor’s
Emergency Directive (“ED”) 1 by placing the Project on an R1 lot.  FAP, ¶27.
Both the CAO and BOE issued reports on the Project on
September 29, 2023.  Those reports did
not disclose the financial impacts of the Project on the General Fund due to
loss of parking revenue for the Special Parking Revenue Fund, whose surplus is
transferred to the General Fund, as well as the cost of site restoration.  Site restoration is not an eligible use of
homeless grant funds.  FAP, ¶28.  The General Services Department did not
conduct a study to determine if the Project site was underutilized as part of
asset management regulations or if the Project met the criteria for interim
housing on City property per the CAO’s assessment protocol.  FAP, ¶31.
With the Project vendor and provider approval occurring behind
closed doors, FTC alleges on information and belief that the City Council has
awarded at least one contract for the Project. FTC is informed and believes that
the City Council has approved the appropriation for LifeArk module purchases
for the Project.  Based on references to
the selection of LA Family Housing as the operator, including in the NOE, FTC
is informed and believes that a contract has been signed or is imminent between
the City and that entity.  FAP, ¶29.
FTC and others objected to the Project during the limited
process provided by the City, including submitting detailed letters and
testifying at public hearings, thereby exhausting any administrative remedies.  FAP, ¶30.
 
C. Causes of Action
The first cause of
action asserts that approval of the Midvale Project was inconsistent with the
Exposition Special Plan, which requires an application filed with the City’s Department
of Planning.  FAP, ¶¶ 43-51.
The second cause of
action asserts that the City wrongly relied on LAMC section 12.80 for approval
of the Project because it is not a shelter as defined by that ordinance.  FAP, ¶¶ 52-62.
The third cause of
action seeks a declaration that the Project is a low barrier navigation center
that cannot be approved under LAMC section 12.80.  FAP, ¶¶ 63-66.
The fourth cause of
action asserts that the Midvale Project approval must be set aside because ED1
precludes creation of a low barrier navigation center property at a location zoned
as residential.  FAP, ¶¶ 67-73.
The fifth cause of action
asserts the Midvale Project approval violates requirements of ED3 and state law.
 FAP, ¶¶ 74-83.
The sixth cause of
action asserts, on information and belief, that the City has entered into a LifeArk
design/fabrication contract for Midvale Project dwelling units, as well as an operating
agreement for the low barrier navigation center.  The contracts are unlawful because they must
be competitively bid and were awarded without such bidding.  FAP, ¶¶ 74-83.
The seventh cause of
action alleges that the Project fails to comply with City Fiscal Policy 32.  FAP, ¶¶ 102-09.
The
eighth cause of action alleges that the Project was not approved by the General
Manager of the City’s Department of Recreation and Parks (“Recreation and
Parks”) as required by Los Angeles Administrative Code (“LAAC”) section 8.59.  FAP, ¶¶ 110-15.
The
ninth cause of action alleges that the City failed to comply with its Asset
Evaluation Framework for the Project.  FAP,
¶¶ 116-22.
The tenth cause of action
asserts that the City failed to properly comply with the CEQA before approving the
Midvale Project.  FAP, ¶¶123-50.
 
D. Prayer
FTC prays for (1) a peremptory writ of mandamus requiring
the City to comply with its mandatory and ministerial duties under state and
local laws and set aside the Project approvals until it does so, (2) declaratory
relief that the Project violates state and local laws and is invalid, (3) an
injunction enjoining the City from development and construction of the Project.
(4) mandamus under CEQA directing the City to (a) set aside and void the NOE,
the Project, and all related approvals, (b) conduct a proper CEQA review, and (c)
take action necessary to become in full compliance with CEQA, LAMC, and LAAC, and
(5) preliminary and permanent injunctions preventing the City from issuing
discretionary or ministerial entitlements for the Project.
 
II. Applicable Law
Demurrers are permitted in administrative mandate
proceedings.  CCP §§1108, 1109.  A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the
pleading alone and will be sustained where the pleading is defective on its
face.
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer or motion to strike or by motion for judgment on the
pleadings.  CCP §430.30(a); Coyne v.
Krempels, (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257.  The
party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed may object by
demurrer or answer to the pleading.  CCP
§430.10.  A demurrer is timely filed
within the 30-day period after service of the complaint.  CCP § 430.40; Skrbina v. Fleming Companies,
(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1353, 1364.
A demurrer may be asserted on any one or more of the
following grounds: (a) The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the
cause of action alleged in the pleading; (b) The person who filed the pleading
does not have legal capacity to sue; (c) There is another action pending
between the same parties on the same cause of action; (d) There is a defect or
misjoinder of parties; (e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action; (f) The pleading is uncertain (“uncertain” includes
ambiguous and unintelligible); (g) In an action founded upon a contract, it
cannot be ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written, is
oral, or is implied by conduct; (h) No certificate was filed as required by CCP
§411.35 or (i) by §411.36.  CCP
§430.10.  Accordingly, a demurrer tests
the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer must appear on
the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.  CCP §430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan,
(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.  The face of
the pleading includes attachments and incorporations by reference (Frantz v.
Blackwell, (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94); it does not include inadmissible
hearsay.  Day v. Sharp, (1975) 50
Cal.App.3d 904, 914.  
The sole issue on demurrer for failure to state a cause of
action is whether the facts pleaded, if true, would entitle the plaintiff to
relief.  Garcetti v. Superior Court,
(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1533, 1547; Limandri v. Judkins, (1997) 52
Cal.App.4th 326, 339.  The question of
plaintiff’s ability to prove the allegations of the complaint or the possible
difficulty in making such proof does not concern the reviewing court.  Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty
Co., (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 47.  The
ultimate facts alleged in the complaint must be deemed true, as well as all
facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.  Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher,
(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403. 
Nevertheless, this rule does not apply to allegations expressing mere
conclusions of law, or allegations contradicted by the exhibits to the
complaint or by matters of which judicial notice may be taken.  Vance v. Villa Park Mobilehome Estates,
(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 698, 709.
For all demurrers filed after January 1, 2016, the demurring
party must meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed
the pleading for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached
that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.  CCP §430.31(a).  As part of the meet and confer process, the
demurring party must identify the causes of action that it believes are subject
to demurrer and provide legal support for the claimed deficiencies.  CCP §430.31(a)(1).  The party who filed the pleading must, in
turn, provide legal support for its position that the pleading is legally
sufficient or, in the alternative, how the complaint, cross-complaint, or
answer could be amended to cure any legal insufficiency.  Id. 
The demurring party is responsible for filing and serving a declaration
that the meet-and-confer requirement has been met.  CCP §430.31(a)(3).  
 
III. Requests for Judicial Notice
A. City’s
Request
In support of its demurrer and
motion to strike, the City seeks judicial notice of the following 28 exhibits
authenticated by declaration:
Exhibits 1 and 2 are the
petition and first amended petition in Fix the City, Inc. v. City of Los
Angeles, (“FTC 1”) LASC Case No. 23STCP03519 pending in Department
82.        
Exhibits 3 through 6 are,
respectively, the City Council’s October 20, 2023 approval of the
Project, an October 4, 2023 report from the Homelessness Committee recommending
that the City Council adopt a BOE report, and a September 29, 2023 BOE report
recommending that the Project is exempt under CEQA.
Exhibits 7 and 8 are the
minutes of the October 18, 2023 Transportation Board public meeting and a
report to the Transportation Board also dated October 18, 2023. 
Exhibit 9 is an October
2, 2023, letter from FTC to Transportation Board concerning the Project. 
Exhibits 10 and 11 are a
certified copy of the NOE for the Project and the State Office of Planning and
Research record of the NOE’s posting.  
Exhibits 12 to 15 are
the City Council’s January 17, 2020 action approving a report relative to
revisions of the City’s Financial Policies, a December 9, 2019 report from the City
Council’s Budget and Finance Committee recommending approval of the revisions,
and pages from a CAO report recommending revisions to the same Financial
Policies.
Exhibit 16 is a joint
powers agreement between the City and County establishing the Los Angeles
Housing Services Authority (“LAHSA”). 
Exhibits 17 to 19 are 2022-2023
LAHS program standards, Crisis Housing Program Scope of Required Services, and
B7 Bridge Housing Scope of Required Services, all of which were incorporated by
reference into the City Council’s approval of the Project.
Exhibit 20 is an agenda
and notice of the February 16, 2024, public meeting of LAHSA’s Programs and
Contracts Committee. 
Exhibit 21 is a printout
of the 2024 Midvale Tiny Home Village Program RFP webpage maintained by LAHSA. 
Exhibit 22 is the final
2024 Midvale Tiny Home Village Program RFP. 

Exhibit 23 is the City
Council Official Action adopting its Asset Evaluation Framework, and the
components of that action.  
Exhibit 24 is a court reporter’s
transcript from the February 15, 2023 trial setting conference in this
case.  
Exhibit 25 is the court’s
minute order from February 15, 2023.  
Exhibit 26 is several City
Charter provisions.  
Exhibit 27 is several
LAAC provisions. 
            Exhibit 28 is Health and
Safety (“H&S”) Code section 50216, effective at the time the Legislature
enacted the Round 1 funding for its Homeless Housing, Assistance, and
Prevention (“HHAP”) program.
            Exhibit 29 is legislative history
for section 21080.27, effective January 1, 2024. 
FTC objects only to the characterizations of Exhibits 7
through 9 and the fact that Exhibit 9 has not been posted to the City Council
file for the Project, and the truth of the contents of Exhibits 20-22.  (Based on its objection, FTC apparently
believes that Exhibit 9 should be part of the administrative record in this
case.)  
The court will not judicially notice the City’s characterizations
of exhibits, only the exhibits themselves. 
Additionally, the court may not take judicial
notice of the truth of the findings in a court document.  Sosinsky v. Grant, (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th
1548, 1551.  Similarly, judicial
notice of official acts of a government agency does not mean that the court may
accept the truth of factual matters in the document since it is the existence
of the contents, not their truth, which is subject to notice.  Cruz v. County of Los Angeles, (1985)
173 Cal.App.3d 1131, 1134.  However, the
court may judicially notice the operative facts which flow from the document’s
existence.  Fontenot v. Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A., (“Fontenot”) (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 256, 266.  See
also JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 743, 755
(“…court may take judicial notice of the fact of a document's recordation, the
date the document was recorded and executed, the parties to the transaction
reflected in a recorded document, and the document's legally operative
language, assuming there is no genuine dispute regarding the document's
authenticity. From this, the court may deduce and rely upon the legal effect of
the recorded document, when that effect is clear from its face.”).  Finally, statements in a document that are of
independent legal significance are not hearsay. 
Am-Cal Investment Co. v. Sharlyn Estates, Inc., (1967) 255
Cal.App.2d 526, 528.  
With
this in mind, Exhibits 1-23 and 26-29 are judicially noticed.  Evid. Code §452(b), (c), (d).  There is no need to judicially notice
Exhibits 24 and 25.  A court can always
review a transcript or order in the case before it.
 
            B. FTC’s Request
            FTC requests judicial
notice of the following six documents.  Exhibits
1-4 are LAMC sections 11.01, 18.01, 4.43, and 64.00.  Exhibit 5 is LAAC section 8.59, and Exhibit 6
is a May 23, 2023 City Councilmember motion.
            The
City objects to Exhibit 6 as unauthenticated. 
The objection is sustained. 
Exhibits 1-4 are judicially noticed. 
Evid. Code §452(b).
 
            C.
City’s Reply Request
            In
support of its reply, the City seeks judicial notice of the following
documents.
            Exhibit
29 is emails between counsel on April 3-4, 2024.
Exhibit 30 is a Bid Inclusion Manual.
Exhibit 31 is a Bid Proposal form for a Project contract.
Exhibit 32 is a Project Description for the Bid.
Exhibit 33 is the March 6, 2024 agenda for the Department of
Public Works for the receipt of bids for the Project.
Exhibit 34 is the March 6, 2024 minutes from the Department
of Public Works meeting.
Exhibits 35-37 are legislative history for section 21080.27.
FTC objects to judicial notice of Exhibits 30-34 as (a) improper
new evidence on reply concerning the competitive bidding issues and (b) evidence
not part of the administrative record and barred by Western States Petroleum
Assn. v. Superior Court, (1995) 9 Cal.4th 559, 571.  In response to the latter objection, the City
argues that these records are admissible as post-determination Project
information.  Perhaps so, but the fact
remains that they are not part of the administrative record now.  The request to judicially notice Exhibits 30-34
is denied.   Exhibit 29 is not subject to
judicial notice and is denied.  
FTC objects to Exhibits 35-37 as irrelevant.  The objection is overruled and Exhibits 35-37
are judicially noticed.  Evid. Code
§452(b).
 
IV. Statement of
Facts
On December 12, 2022, Mayor Karen
Bass declared a Local Homeless Emergency under LAAC section 8.27 regarding
individuals experiencing homelessness. 
City RJN Ex. 2 (FTC 1 FAP, ¶1). 
As a result of this and subsequent emergency declarations, permits for
100% affordable housing became exempt from discretionary review and the usual
procedure of public hearings and rights to appeal.  FTC 1 FAP, ¶66.  
On December 16, 2022, the Mayor
issued ED1 (“Expedition of Permits and Clearances for Temporary Shelters and
Affordable Housing Types”) pursuant to LAAC section 8.29.  FTC 1 FAP, ¶42, Ex 2.  
On December 21, 2022, the Mayor
issued ED2 (“Inside Safe Initiative”), which cited to LAAC section 8.29 and
8.27 declarations.  FTC 1 FAP, ¶44.  
On February 10, 2023, the Mayor issued
ED3 (“Emergency Use of Viable City-Owned Property”) pursuant to LAAC section
8.29.  FTC 1, ¶46.  
On June 12, 2023, the Mayor
reissued ED1, maintaining its original title but adding “in no instance shall
the project be located in a single family or more restrictive zone.”  FTC 1 FAP, ¶47.
On June 27, 2023, the City Council
adopted a new ordinance, LAAC section 8.33 (“Local Housing and/or Homelessness
Emergency”), effective on or about July 5, 2023.  Id. 
Two days later, on July 7, 2023, the Mayor declared a new emergency
under the recently passed LAAC section 8.33. 
Id.  LAAC was adopted to
vest the Mayor with additional authority to address Los Angeles’ chronic
homelessness conditions, as well as housing production within the City.  FTC 1 FAC, ¶4.  
Although Govt. Code section 8630
sets forth requirements for local emergency declarations, including regular and
recurring ratifications to ensure the emergency authority is not misused, LAAC
8.33 only requires that a resolution ratifying the emergency be presented to
the City Council.  FTC 1 FAP, ¶9.  Similarly, LAAC section 8.33 exempts qualifying
contracts from the competitive bidding requirements maintained by Public
Contracts Code Section 20162.  FTC 1
FAP, ¶4. 
On January 2, 2024, FTC filed FTC
1, which was assigned to the Honorable Curtis Kin in Department 82.[1]   FTC prayed for mandamus and declaratory
relief requiring the City to set aside LAAC section 8.33, the Mayor’s July 7,
2023 Declaration issued under LAAC section 8.33,  ED 1, 2, 3, 
Guidelines, DWP Project Powerhouse, ED 6, the Housing and Homelessness
Emergency Action Plan and any other rules or regulations promulgated by any
City agency or department pursuant to the 8.33 Declaration.  Ex. 2, p. 51. 
 
V. Demurrer
The City demurs to the FAP, contending that (a) causes of
action seven to ten fail to state a cause of action and (b) the entire FAP should be abated with the
exception of the claims to which its demurrer is sustained.  
  
A. Meet and Confer
On February 28, 2024, the City e-mailed a meet and confer
letter to FTC’s counsel.  Mahlowitz Decl.,
¶2.  The parties’ counsel had a meet and
confer conversation on March 5, 2024 and did not resolve the issues raised by
the City’s meet and confer letter other than the FAP’s inaccurate citation to
Govt. Code section 8698(c), to which FTC subsequently filed an errata. Id.
The City has complied with the meet and confer requirements
of CCP section 430.31(a).  
 
B. The CEQA Claim (Tenth Cause of Action)
1. The FAP’s Allegations
The tenth cause of action seeks declarator relief and
mandamus for a violation of CEQA.  FAP,
¶¶ 125-50.
The Project site is City SPRF Parking Lot 707, encompassing
two parcels.  FAP,
¶124.  Both parcels are used as a
City-owned parking lot, Lot 707, which provides critical customer parking and
ADA parking to small businesses nearby.  FAP,
¶125.  The parcel north of the alley
abuts single-family homes on its eastern, western, and northern
boundaries.  The parcel south of the
alley has commercial uses on its eastern and western boundaries and Pico
Boulevard on its southern boundary.  FAP,
¶126.
The Project would construct and operate a low-barrier
navigation center with 33 sleeping units, two of which would be ADA
accessible.  FAP, ¶127. The Project would
result in an intensive use of the single-family-zoned site by providing 24-hour
services such as emergency shelter, hygiene, storage, food services and case
management.  Project operations would include
approximately six to eight employees scheduled in shifts throughout the day,
with site security provided on a 24/7 basis or per a security plan consistent
with LAHSA standards.  FAP, ¶128.
According to the NOE, a third-party service provider would
operate the Project and it is anticipated that a ten-year lease or similar
operating may be executed in the future between the City, a service provider, the
County, and/or LAHSA.  The Project would
be operated under LAHSA’s program requirements for crisis and bridge shelters.  FAP, ¶129.
The two statutory CEQA exemptions cited in the NOE are Pub.
Res. Code section 21080(b)(4), which provides that the Act does apply to
“specific actions necessary to prevent or mitigate an emergency,” and section
21080.27, which pertains only to the City’s activities in furtherance of
emergency shelters and support housing. 
FAP, ¶132.  Before invoking a
statutory exemption, the City needed substantial evidence showing it had met
all elements of the exemption.  This it
failed to do.  Without a project application,
it is infeasible to conclude that the Project is exempt.  FAP, ¶133.[2]
Under section 21080.27, CEQA does not apply to projects that
are shown to be “activities undertaken by the City of Los Angeles within the
City of Los Angeles” that include the “issuance of an entitlement for, or the
approval of the construction of, an affordable housing project, a low-barrier
navigation center, a supportive housing project, or a transitional housing project
for youth and young adults.” 
§21080.27(b)(1).  FAP, ¶143.
The statutory exemption does not apply unless the terms of
section 21080.27(e) have been met. 
Subdivision (e)(1)(A) provides: 
“For…[a] low-barrier navigation center…that is not in its entirety a
public work for purposes of Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 1720) of Part 7
of Division 2 of the Labor Code, this section applies only if the project
sponsor certifies to the lead agency that all of the following [labor and wages
requirements] will be met for any construction or rehabilitation work”.  FAP, ¶144.
The Project is not entirely a public work.  FTC is informed and believes, and based
thereon alleges, that neither the operation of the shelter nor dismantlement of
the Project and restoration of the parking lot will be a public work and not a
valid use of HHAP program funding. 
Therefore, the labor and wages requirements of section 21080.27(e)
apply.  FAP, ¶145.
The City did not make any findings that the labor and wages
requirements of section 21080.27(e) will be met.  Despite knowing about AB 785, the City made
findings only applicable to AB 1197, the former version of section 21080.27.  FAP, ¶146. 
The record does not contain substantial evidence for the application of
the two statutory exemptions from CEQA. FAP, ¶148.  
 
2. Statutory Exemptions
            “Statutory
exemptions, as the term implies, are those enacted by the Legislature.”  North Coast Rivers Alliance
v. Westlands Water Dist., (“North Coast Rivers”) (2014) 227
Cal.App.4th 832, 850.  “‘Because CEQA
is statutory in origin, the Legislature has the power to create exemptions from
its requirements…regardless of their potential for adverse [environmental]
consequences.’”  Id. (quoting
Great Oaks Water Co. v.
Santa Clara Valley Water Dist., (“Great Oaks”) (2009) 170
Cal.App.4th 956, 966, n. 8). 
“Statutory exemptions are absolute, which is to say that the exemption
applies if the project fits within its terms.” Great Oaks, supra,
170 Cal.App.4th at 966, n. 8. 

            The
construction of a CEQA statutory exemption is a matter of statutory
interpretation which the court reviews de novo.   North Coast Rivers, supra, 227
Cal.App.4th at 851.  An
agency’s finding that a statutory exemption applies to a project is reviewed
for substantial evidence.  Concerned Dublin Citizens v.
City of Dublin, (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1311.  The court’s substantial evidence evaluation
concerning a statutory exemption considers “whether the administrative record
contains relevant information that a reasonable mind might accept as sufficient
to support the conclusion reached.” North Coast Rivers,
supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at 851. 
“All conflicts in the evidence are resolved in support of the agency’s
action and [courts] indulge all reasonable inferences to support the agency’s
findings, if possible.” Id.   
            
            3. Section
21080.27
            To
speed creation of interim shelters to address homelessness in the City, the
Legislature enacted section
21080.27.  The Legislature amended section
21080.27, effective January 1, 2024, and the parties agree that the amended and
current version of section 21080.27 governs the determination of FTC’s CEQA
claim.  See Citizens for Positive Growth
& Preservation v. City of Sacramento, (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 609, 626
(CEQA traffic analysis challenge mooted by change in law eliminating alleged
requirement); Ocean
Street Extension Neighborhood Assn. v. City of Santa Cruz, (2021) 73
Cal.App.5th 985, 1021 (same).  Dem.
at 8-9. 
            A
project undertaken by the City of paid for in part with public funds which is
“[t]he issuance of an entitlement for, or the approval of the construction of .
. . a low barrier navigation center” is exempt from CEQA.  §21080.27(b)(1).  
            A
“low barrier navigation center” is a facility that meets the definition in Govt. Code section 65660(a) “that
is funded in whole or in part” by any of a number of sources, including “the
[“HHAP”] program established pursuant to Section 50217 of the Health and
Safety Code.”  §21080.27(a)(6).  Dem. at 9-10.
            In turn, a “low barrier navigation center” is defined
in Govt. Code section 65660(a): 
“’Low Barrier Navigation Center’ means a Housing
First, low-barrier, service-enriched shelter focused on moving people into
permanent housing that provides temporary living facilities while case managers
connect individuals experiencing homelessness to income, public benefits,
health services, shelter, and housing. “Low Barrier” means best practices to
reduce barriers to entry, and may include, but is not limited to, the
following: (1) The presence of partners if it is not a population-specific
site, such as for survivors of domestic violence or sexual assault, women, or
youth, (2) Pets, (3) The storage of possessions, and (4) Privacy, such as
partitions around beds in a dormitory setting or in larger rooms containing
more than two beds, or private rooms.”  
            Section 21080.27(e) imposes additional requirements where the low barrier
navigation center project “is not in its entirety a public work for
purposes of Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 1720) of Part 7 of
Division 2 of the Labor Code.”  Where the project is not in its entirety a
public work, it is exempt under CEQA “only if the project sponsor certifies to
the lead agency that all of the following will be met for any construction or
rehabilitation work: 
 
“(i) All construction and
rehabilitation workers employed in the execution of the project will be paid at
least the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for the type of work and
geographic area….
 
(ii) The project sponsor ensures that
the prevailing wage requirement is included in all contracts for the
performance of the work for those portions of the project that are not a public
work.
 
(iii) All contractors and
subcontractors for those portions of the project that are not a public work
comply with both of the following:
 
            (I)
Pay to all construction and rehabilitation workers employed in the execution of
the work at least the general prevailing rate of per diem wages….
 
            (II)
Maintain and verify payroll records pursuant to Section 1776 of the Labor Code and make those
records available for inspection and copying as provided in that section.  This subclause does not apply if all
contractors and subcontractors performing work on the project are subject to a
project labor agreement that requires the payment of prevailing wages to all
construction workers employed in the execution of the project and provides for
enforcement of that obligation through an arbitration procedure.”  §21080.27(e)(1)(A).

 
            Labor
Code section 1720 defines “public works”
and “paid for in whole or in part out of public funds.”  Labor Code section 1720(a)
states in relevant part:
“As used in this
chapter, “public works” means all of the following:
(1) Construction, alteration, demolition, installation, or repair work
done under contract and paid for in whole or in part out of public funds….For
purposes of this paragraph, “construction” includes work performed during the
design, site assessment, feasibility study, and other preconstruction phases of
construction, including, but not limited to, inspection and land surveying
work, regardless of whether any further construction work is conducted, and
work performed during the postconstruction phases of construction, including,
but not limited to, all cleanup work at the jobsite. For purposes of this
paragraph, “installation” includes, but is not limited to, the assembly and
disassembly of freestanding and affixed modular office systems….” (emphasis
added).
            
            Labor Code section
1720(b) states in relevant part:
“For purposes
of this section, “paid for in whole or in part out of public funds” means all
of the following: (1) The payment of money or the equivalent of money by the
state or political subdivision directly to or on behalf of the public works
contractor, subcontractor, or developer….”
            If
the City determines an activity is not subject to CEQA pursuant to section
21080.27(b), it must file a NOE with the County for a minimum of 30 days as
well as with OPR.  §21080.27(f). 
            
            4. Analysis
            The
City relied on section 21080.27’s statutory exemption to approve the Midvale
Project.  City RJN Ex. 3 (City Council
approval); City RJN Ex. 5 (BOE report).  The
City argues that the record before the City Council contains substantial
evidence showing the Project is statutorily exempt from CEQA pursuant to
section 21080.27.  Dem. at 8-9.
            The
Midvale Project is a low barrier navigation center. The City’s
approval documents require the Project to provide temporary housing of
generally no more than 90 days and case managers to assist residents to locate
permanent housing.  RJN Ex. 5, pp.152-53 (BOE
report, NOE attachment). The Project reduces all unnecessary barriers to entry
and partners of residents may be present, pets are allowed, personal
possessions storage areas are provided, and privacy is ensured because each
resident has a separate dwelling unit with an ensuite bathroom.  Id., p. 155.  Dem. at 11.
            The
Midvale Project meets the definition of a navigation center for which Round 1
HHAP funds may be used.  The Project is
paid for entirely with public money.  The
City Council’s approval states the Project budget as $4,597,353, entirely
comprised of money from the City’s General Fund and HHAP Round 1 funds.  City RJN Ex. 5, p. 159 (NOE attachment); City
RJN Ex. 6, p. 170 (CAO report). Contrary to the FAP’s assertion (¶145), the
Project’s HHAP funding is authorized by law. The Legislature has enacted different
statutes establishing five rounds of HHAP funding, with Round 1 occurring in
2019.  H&S Code §§ 50217 (Round
1); H&S Code §§ 50216-50220.8, 50232. 
The law governing HHAP Round 1 funds states that the money may be used
for “operating subsidies in new…navigation centers” and “[n]ew navigation
centers and emergency shelters based on demonstrated need.” H&S Code §50219(c)(2), (8).   The
City Council expressly identified HHAP Round 1 money to fund some Project needs,
including operations and construction.  City
RJN Ex. 6, pp. 168-70 (CAO report).  Dem.
at 11.[3]
            The
FAP wrongly asserts, on information and belief, that the Midvale Project is not
a public work.  FAP, ¶145.  Labor Code section 1720
provides the definition of “public works” for section 201080.27(e).  FTC’s contention (FAP, ¶145) that removal of
the Project’s modular platform and units from the site at the end of the Project
is not encompassed within this definition misreads Labor Code section 1720.  The Project was designed to be installed atop
a removable platform and taken away in ten years, and that removal is a
component of the Project.  See RJN
Ex. 8, pp. 179-80, 189 (Transportation Board report and attachment E (project
illustrations)).  Labor Code section 1720(a) defines “public
works” to include “construction” and “demolition” work if paid for in whole or
in part with public funds, which is the case here.  The Project is entirely a public work.  Dem. at 12.
            Moreover,
the FAP’s allegations concerning Project funding sources presented on
information in belief is insufficient to create a factual dispute defeating
demurrer.  A pleading allegation made on
information and belief is defective unless the source of the belief is also
alleged.  Doe v. City of Los Angeles,
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550; Gomes v. Countrywide Home
Loans, Inc., (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1158–59.  FTC’s unattributed belief that private funds
will be used to pay for the Project does not create a disputed question of
fact.  Dem. at 12.
            The
City filed all NOEs required by section 21080.27 by filing an NOE with the
County Recorder and OPR stating that the City has determined the Midvale
Project is statutorily exempt from CEQA pursuant to section 21080.27.  City RJN Exs. 9-10.  As such, substantial evidence demonstrates the
Midvale Project is exempt from CEQA.  
Dem. at 12-13.[4]
            FTC
responds that the NOE and accompanying documents do not present evidence of the
certification of the wage and labor requirements for Midvale.  See City’s RJN Exs. 5, 6.  The City argues it was not required to do so
because Midvale is “in its entirety a public work.”  There is no such evidence presented in the
demurrer and the legal argument fails.  Opp.
at 17.
            The
definition of “public works” in Labor Code
section 1720(a)(1) that speaks of construction paid “in whole or in part” by
public funds cannot change section 21080.27(e)’s requirement that a project
“that is not in its entirety a public work” must meet wage and labor
requirements to be exempt from CEQA.  Labor Code section 1720 does not state that a
project funded in part by public funds is in its entirety a public work; it merely defines “public works” generally.  The plain meaning of section 21080.27(e)’s phrase
“in its entirety a public work” means that the project is fully funded
by public funds.   That is not the case for the Midvale Project,
or in any event, it cannot yet be determined because the City failed to
disclose the costs to be incurred for Project operations and eventual site
restoration.  The court “must avoid a
statutory ‘“construction making some words surplusage”’, “and every word should
be given some significance, leaving no part useless or devoid of meaning.”  K.R.
v. Superior Court (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1193, 1206 (citations omitted).  To read Labor
Code section 1720 as altering the “entirety” requirement of section 21080.27 would render the words “that is not
in its entirety a public work” meaningless. 
Opp. at 17.
            A well-established
rule of statutory construction is that a specific statute controls over a
general statute covering the same subject. 
“Generally, it can be presumed that when the Legislature has enacted a
specific statute to deal with a particular matter, it would intend the specific
statute to control over more general provisions of law that might otherwise
apply.”    Thai v. Richmond City Center, L.P., (2022)
86 Cal.App.5th 282, 290 (citation omitted). 
Labor Code section 1700 generally
defines public works, while section 21080.27
provides specific requirements for invoking the CEQA exemption.  Had the Legislature wanted partially publicly
funded projects to come within the CEQA exemption, it could have said so.  Another rule of construction is that a court should
not insert language that has been omitted or omit language which has been
inserted.  CCP §1858.  The City seeks to add words to section 21080.27
that the Legislature chose not to use.  Opp.
at 1-18.
            FTC
argues that the question then is whether the Midvale Project is in its entirety
a public work because it is fully funded with public funds?  The answer is “No”.  The City claims that its evidence shows the
Project is fully funded with public funds, citing City RJN Exhibits 5 and
6.  Those exhibits show funding from HHAP
and the General Fund.  See City RJN Ex. 6, p. 170.  However, the FAP alleges that the CAO fiscal
report, dated September 29, 2023, states: ‘The recommendations in this report
will be funded with the City’s General Fund previously approved for
homelessness interventions and the HHAP Round 1 funds….Funding for
operations of the site will be programmed in a future funding report.’”  FAP
¶103; City RJN Ex. 6, p. 171 (emphasis
added).    Opp. at
18.
            There
is no evidence that the Project operations and removal of the Midvale Project
fixtures are publicly funded.  As alleged
in the FAP, the Project includes
restoration of the Midvale property in ten years with CD 5 having financial
responsibility to do so.  FAP ¶¶ 104-06. But
the Project provides no funding for that restoration.  The funding cannot come from HHAP.   H&S
Code section 50219(c) provides that “a recipient of a round 1 [HHAP] program
allocation shall expend funds on evidence-based solutions that address and
prevent homelessness among eligible populations including any of the following
[list]….”  The list does not include
property site restoration.  FAP, ¶145. 
Opp. at 18.[5]
            FTC
concludes that there is no substantial
evidence the Midvale Project is fully funded by public funds and therefore it
is not “in its entirety a public work”.  Since
the City did not make any of the required findings that the labor and wages
requirements of section 21080.27(e) will
be met (FAP, ¶146), the Project does not
qualify for the section 21080.27 CEQA exemption and the demurrer to the tenth
cause of action should be overruled. 
Opp.  at 19.

The Proper Interpretation of Section 21080.27(e)
In
construing a legislative enactment, a court must ascertain the intent of the
legislative body which enacted it to effectuate the purpose of the law.  Brown v. Kelly Broadcasting Co., (“Brown”)
(1989) 48 Cal.3d 711, 724; Orange County Employees Assn. v. County of Orange,
(“Orange County”) (1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 833, 841.  The court first looks to the language of the
statute, attempting to give effect to the usual, ordinary import of the
language and seeking to avoid making any language mere surplusage.  Brown, supra, 48 Cal 3d at 724.  Significance, if possible, is attributed to
every word, phrase, sentence and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative
purpose.  Orange County, supra,
234 Cal.App.3d at 841.  The statute’s
language must be harmonized with provisions relating to the same subject matter
to the extent possible.  Id.  “‘The
statute's words generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative
intent; if they are clear and unambiguous, ‘[t]here is no need for judicial
construction and a court may not indulge in it. [Citation.]’” MCI
Communications Services, Inc. v. California Dept. of Tax & Fee
Administration, (“MCI”) (2018) 28 Cal. App. 5th 635, 643.
            If
a statute is ambiguous and susceptible to more than one reasonable
interpretation, the court may resort to extrinsic aids, including principles of
construction and legislative history.  MacIsaac v. Waste Management Collection
& Recycling, Inc., (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1082 (quoting Riverview Fire Protection Dist. v. Workers’ Comp. Appeals Bd.,
(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1120, 1126).  Where
ambiguity still remains, the court should consider “reason, practicality, and
common sense.”  Id. at 1084.  This requires consideration of the statute’s
purpose, the evils to be remedied, public policy, and contemporaneous
administrative construction.  MCI,
supra, 28 Cal.App.5th at
643.  The enactment must be given a
reasonable and commonsense interpretation consistent with the apparent purpose
and intent of the lawmakers, practical rather than technical in nature, and
which, when applied, will result in wise policy rather than mischief or
absurdity.  Lungren v. Deukmejian,
(1988) 45 Cal. 3d 727, 735.  Finally,
statutes are not construed in isolation; every statute must be read and
harmonized with the statutory scheme.  People
v. Ledesma, (1997) 16 Cal.4th 90, 95.   

            Section
21080.27 subdivisions (b) through (d) establish the types of actions exempt
from CEQA if taken by the City, County, or a list of County public agencies to
create affordable housing projects, low-barrier navigation centers, supportive
housing projects, and transitional housing projects for youth and young adults
(“housing crisis projects”).  This CEQA
exemption, only open to Los Angeles region public agencies, applies to both
public and privately owned housing crisis projects.  
            Section
21080.27(e) imposes requirements where the low barrier navigation center
project “is not in its entirety a public work for purposes of Chapter 1
(commencing with Section 1720) of Part 7 of Division 2 of the Labor Code.”  Where the project is not in its entirety a
public works, it is exempt under CEQA only if the project sponsor certifies to
the lead agency that the construction or rehabilitation work will be subject to
prevailing wage laws. 
            The
Legislature intended section 21080.27(e) to ensure that a housing crisis
project’s construction and rehabilitation contracts comply with Labor Code
prevailing wage laws – whether or not public funds are involved -- before the project
will be exempt from CEQA.  Because
private housing crisis projects may be exempt, the subdivision provides that,
if the project is “not in its entirety a public work” for purposes of Labor
Code section 1720, it is
exempt from CEQA only if the project sponsor certifies to the lead agency that
any construction or rehabilitation work will meet prevailing wage law
requirements.  
            FTC is
incorrect that the phrase “in its entirety a public work” in section
21080.27(e) means “a project entirely paid for with public funds.”  Section 21080.27(e) states that “in its
entirety a public work” is defined by the Labor Code.  Public works contracts are limited to the
construction-type agreements described by Labor
Code section 1720.
 Labor Code section 1720(a)(1)
defines “public works” as “[c]onstruction, alteration, demolition,
installation, or repair work done under contract and paid for in whole or in
part out of public funds.” (emphasis added).  Hence, if any part of a construction contract
is paid for with public funds, it is a public works contract.  Case law also establishes that, if one project
contract is a public works, all the project’s construction contracts are public
works.  Azusa Land Partners v.
Department of Industrial Relations,
(2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 1, 19–22.  
            Thus,
if any part of a housing crisis project is paid for with public funds, it is a
public works project.  As a result, there
is no need for section 21080.27(e) to require that all housing crisis project costs
be publicly funded in order to qualify as “in its entirety a public work”.  When it enacted section 21080.27(e), the
Legislature knew that a construction contract for a housing crisis project paid
for even partly with public funds is in its entirety a public work.  “The Legislature is presumed to be aware of
existing laws and judicial decisions and to have enacted or amended statutes in
light of this knowledge.”  League of California Cities
v. Superior Court, (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 976, 986 (citing People v. Overstreet,
(1986) 42 Cal.3d 891, 897. Therefore, the Legislature intended section
21080.27(e) to make clear that privately funded housing crisis projects would
be subject to prevailing wage laws.[6]
            In sum, the proper interpretation of section 21080.27(e)’s
imposition of prevailing wage requirements where the low barrier navigation
center project “is not in its entirety a public work” is that it ensures all housing
crisis project construction contracts pay prevailing wages regardless of the
funding source for those agreements.  If
public funds pay for any part of a housing crisis project’s construction
contract, then all its construction contracts are public works, meaning that they
must all comply with the prevailing wage laws in Labor Code section 1770 et.
seq.  
 
            b.
City Charter Section 370
            The City argues in the alternative that FTC’s
interpretation of section 21080.27(e) does not matter because the City Charter
mandates that the City comply with all section 21080.27(e) prevailing wage law
requirements.  As a result, the Midvale
Project is entirely budgeted with public funds. 
Reply at 6.
            If a
housing crisis project is not in its entirety a public work, section 21080.27(e)(1)(A)
(i) through (iii) imposes the Labor Code’s prevailing wage laws as a condition of
a CEQA exemption.  The project sponsor must
certify that the project will comply with section 21080.27(e)’s prevailing wage
law obligations, which are those in the Labor Code.  
            The
City argues that City Charter section 377 mandates all City public works
contracts comply with the Labor Code’s prevailing wage laws, which impose the
same prevailing wage requirements of section 21080.27(e), and therefore all
Midvale Project contracts must meet the requirements of section 21080.27(e).  Reply at 3.
            City
Charter section 377 (“Prevailing Wage”) states: 
 
“The provisions of California Labor Code Section
1770 et. seq. regarding prevailing wages on public works and related
regulations, as now existing and as may be amended, are accepted and made
applicable to the City, its departments, boards, officers, agents and
employees.”  City RJN Ex. 25, p. 453. 
 
            The
City Charter mandates that every City construction contract is a public work that
must comply with all Labor Code prevailing wage law statutes. Neither the City
Council, the Mayor, nor any City official may avoid this legal requirement.  See Domar Electric, Inc. v. City
of Los Angeles, (1994) 9 Cal.4th 161, 171 (“A charter city may not act
in conflict with its charter. [Citations.] Any act that is violative of or not
in compliance with the charter is void.”).  City funds will be used for Project construction.
 City RJN Ex. 6, pp. 169, 171 (CAO report).
            FTC’s
assertion that the source of operational funding was not appropriated at the
time of Project approval makes no difference. 
The Labor Code’s prevailing wage laws apply to construction and
rehabilitation contracts, not operation agreements.  Further, no facts support FTC’s suggestion
that some hidden private interest exists to pay to construct or operate the
Midvale low-barrier navigation center, which is why the City’s taxpayers are
paying to shelter Angelenos experiencing homelessness.  Reply at 7, n. 3.  Accordingly, every Midvale Project
construction contract will be a public works.  Reply at 7.
            Therefore,
even if the Midvale Project is not deemed “in its entirety a public work” under
section 21080.27(e), the Midvale Project will comply with the requirements of section
21080.27(e)(1)(A)(i) through (iii) because the City Charter imposes the same
obligations via the Labor Code’s prevailing wage law mandates.  Reply at 7.
            FTC’s
argument that the City’s November 2023 NOE and accompanying documents do
not present substantial evidence of the certification of the wage and labor
requirements for the Midvale Project, and cannot do so because section
21080.27(e) did not exist until January 1, 2024 is unavailing because the City
need not declare that it will comply with its own City Charter.  There is no need for the City (the Project
sponsor) to certify to itself (the CEQA lead agency) that the City will comply
with its laws and pay prevailing wages for all construction or rehabilitation
contracts; that is required at all times by the City Charter.  
            The
court agrees with the City that the NOE was not required to address elements of
a statute that did not exist when adopted.  In any event, an NOE is required to do no more
than “provide a ‘brief’ description of the approved project, state its
location, and set forth reasons for the agency’s finding of exemption.” Stockton Citizens for
Sensible Planning v. City of Stockton, (2010) 48 Cal.4th 481, 514; CEQA
Guidelines §15602(a)).  The NOEs did so
by stating that the Project is exempt from CEQA requirements pursuant to section
21080.27 and providing a lengthy narrative.  See City RJN Ex. 10, pp. 227-36.[7]  
 
            c.
Conclusion
            The proper interpretation of section 21080.27(e)’s
imposition of prevailing wage requirements where the low barrier navigation
center project “is not in its entirety a public work” is that the subdivision ensures
that all housing crisis project construction contracts pay prevailing wages
regardless of the funding source for those agreements.  The Midvale Project is in its entirety a
public work.  In any event, the Midvale
Project will comply with the requirements of section 21080.27(e)(1)(A)(i)
through (iii) because the City Charter imposes the same prevailing wage law
mandates.  No other factual findings are
required to conclude that the Project is statutorily exempt.  The demurrer to the tenth cause of action for
violation of CEQA is sustained for failure to state a claim.
 
            C.
Violation of Fiscal Policy 32 (Seventh Cause of Action)
1. The FAP’s
Allegations
The seventh cause of
action seeks declaratory relief and mandamus, alleging that the Project fails
to comply with the City’s Fiscal Policy 32. 
FAP, ¶¶ 102-09.  
Fiscal Policy 32 provides: “Reports to the Mayor and City
Council shall include Fiscal Impact Statements that include the full cost of
the program or service in the current year, plus the future annual costs.”  FAP, ¶103.
The CAO’s Fiscal Report, dated September 29, 2023, states:
“The recommendations in this report will be funded with the City’s General Fund
previously approved for homelessness interventions and the HHAP Round 1
funds.  There is no additional impact to
the General Fund as a result of the recommendations in this report.  Funding for operations of the site will be
programmed in a future funding report.” 
(emphasis added).  FAP, ¶103.
FTC
argues that the Project’s approval violates Fiscal Policy 32’s requirements for
full disclosure of the budget, including operations.  Fiscal Policy 32, adopted as a City
ordinance, establishes a mandatory legal requirement that reports to the Mayor
and City Council shall include Fiscal Impact Statements covering the full cost
of a program or service in the current year, as well as future annual costs.  Approval of the Project without accounting
for its operational expenses constitutes a breach of the legal obligation to
provide a complete financial picture to the City Council and the public,
rendering the Project and its approvals illegal.  FAP, ¶103.
According to a staff report prepared by the Los Angeles
Department of Transportation (“LADOT”) but not submitted to the City Council or
provided to the public prior to the City Council’s October 20, 2023 action, “[t]he operation and maintenance of Lot No. 707 while used
for the Modular Interim  Housing Facility
will be the sole responsibility of Council District 5.”  (emphasis added).  The costs associated with this responsibility
were not disclosed.  FAP, ¶104.
The same report disclosed that CD 5 “shall be responsible for the restoration
of Lot No. 707 back to its existing condition as a parking lot, or better, prior
to the construction of the Modular Interim 
Housing Facility; or, in the alternative, Council District 5 shall
compensate the SPRF for costs associated with restoring the parking lot by
the Department, or other City agency, or independent contractor selected by the
Department to perform the work.”  (emphasis added). 
The costs associated with this responsibility were not disclosed.  HHAP program funds do not list site
restoration as an eligible use.  FAP,
¶105.
The same report disclosed that “[s]hould the Board approve the conversion of Lot No. 707 to
a Modular Interim Housing Facility, LADOT expects an annual loss of $53,000 to
the SPRF based on pre-pandemic revenue. 
With the Modular Interim Housing Facility expected to remain in
place for the next 10 years, the cumulative estimated SPRF revenue impact is a
loss of $530,000.”  The losses to the SPRF
were not disclosed to the City Council.  Surplus funds in the SPRF Trust Fund are
routinely transferred to the General Fund. 
Thus, the loss of revenue for Lot 707 will reduce the surplus transfer
and impact the General Fund.  FAP,
¶106.
 
2. Analysis
            The
City acknowledges that Fiscal Policy 32 states that CAO reports to the Mayor
and City Council “shall include Fiscal Impact Statements that include the full
cost of the program or service in the current year, plus the future annual
costs” (City RJN Ex. 15, p. 301) and that the City Council’s action adopting
the Fiscal Policies states that Fiscal Policy 32 serves a “public
participation” goal.  Dem. at 13.
            The
City makes three arguments why mandamus is not available for the CAO’s failure
to include operational and restoration costs, and loss of revenue from the SPRF,
in the September 29, 2023 fiscal report for the Project.
            The
City first argues that, while Fiscal Policy 32 applies to CAO reports, nothing
in the City’s Fiscal Policies precludes the City Council from acting if the CAO
fails to provide a Fiscal Impact Statement.  See City RJN Exs 12-14 (Financial Policy
enactments).  Fiscal Policy 32 is not a
limitation on the City Council’s authority to act.  Dem. at 13. 

            FTC
fails to respond to this point.  That is,
FTC does not provide any authority that the CAO’s failure to completely perform
a duty under Policy 32 has any impact on the City Council’s ability to approve the
Project.  The City Council has discretion
to overlook a subordinate’s failure and this fact is dispositive of the seventh
cause of action.
            The
City next argues that Fiscal Policy 32 is directory for the CAO, not mandatory,
and thus not enforceable.  Mandamus can issue
only to compel a mandatory obligation to act.  See, e.g., State Comp. Ins. Fund v.
Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd., (“State
Comp. Ins. Fund”) (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 349, 370.  “Whether a particular statute is intended to
impose a mandatory duty is a question of interpretation for the courts.”  Garrison v. Rourke, (1948) 32 Cal.2d
430, 435). “Neither the word ‘may,’ nor the word ‘shall,’ is dispositive.”  People v. Allen, (2007)
42 Cal.4th 91, 101–03.  Instead, a
court looks to legislative intent to determine what effect to give a
regulation.  Id.  “When the Legislature intends to make a
statutory directive mandatory, it generally does so by providing a
self-executing consequence for the government’s failure to act….”  State Comp. Ins. Fund, supra, 248 Cal.App.4th at 364–65.
 By contrast, statutes “that do not
include a self-executing consequence are almost universally construed as
directory, rather than mandatory or jurisdictional.”  Id.  Neither Fiscal Policy 32, any other Financial
Policy, nor other regulation or provision of law imposes any penalty or
consequence if the CAO fails to provide a Fiscal Impact Statement.  See RJN Exs. 12-14.  Dem. at 13-14.
            FTC responds
that Fiscal Policy 32 states that reports to the
Mayor and City Council shall
include Fiscal Impact Statements that include future annual costs, and the LAMC consistently defines “shall” as
mandatory.  LAMC §§ 11.01,
18.01, 4.44, 64.00 (“shall” is mandatory and “may” is permissive).  Pet. RJN
Exs. 1-4.  “‘The Legislature has power to prescribe legal definitions of its own
language, and when an act passed by the Legislature embodies a defined term,
its statutory definition is ordinarily binding on the courts.’  [Citation.]” 
City of Los Angeles v. City of
Los Angeles Employee Relations Bd., (2016) 7 Cal.App.5th 150, 163.  The City has clearly defined “shall” as
mandatory, not directory, and that should be binding.  Opp. 
at 12.
            This
is true but the City correctly replies that, although the CAO’s duty is mandatory,
Fiscal Policy 32 is still directory because there is no self-executing
consequence for the failure to comply.  See State Comp. Ins.
Fund, supra, 248
Cal.App.4th at 364–65.  Reply
at 10-11.
            Moreover,
the CAO has discretion in performing its mandatory duty under Fiscal Policy
32.   The City correctly relies on the
fact that “[e]ven if mandatory language appears in a statute creating a duty,
the duty is discretionary if the public entity must exercise significant
discretion to perform the duty.”  Childhelp, Inc. v. City of
Los Angeles, (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 224, 239 (citations omitted).  Whether an ordinance imposes a ministerial
duty for which mandamus will lie or only a discretionary duty is a question of
statutory interpretation and issue of law for the court to decide.  Id. 
Fiscal Policy 32 does not mandate the precise contents of a Fiscal Impact
Report, leaving that to the judgment of the CAO.   Thus, the CAO has discretion in how to
perform a mandatory duty which cannot be second-guessed via mandamus.  Reply at 10.
            The
City’s third argument why mandamus cannot enforce Fiscal Policy 32 is that the FTC
1 FAP alleges (RJN Ex. 2, ¶¶ 103-06) that the LADOT’s General Manager’s
report to the Transportation Board before the City Council’s approval of the
Midvale Project publicly disclosed the financial impacts that the CAO’s
Financial Impact Statement did not disclose. 
These financial impacts just were not labelled as a CAO Fiscal Impact
Report.  The Transportation Board approved
the report as part of its Project approval, an action that occurred at a
noticed public meeting.  City RJN Ex. 7;
City RJN Ex. 8, p. 4.  The report was
available to the City Council and the public before the City Council acted.  As a result, Fiscal Policy 32’s transparency
purpose was met.  Dem. at 14.
            FTC answers that the
LADOT General Manager’s report was never presented to the City Council and
never approved by the Transportation Board. 
Even if the report is part of the administrative record, despite the
fact that it was not presented to the City Council or approved by the Transportation
Board, it presents inherently factual disputes not capable of resolution on
demurrer.  The lack of disclosure of operation costs, the costs of restoring Lot
707 by Council District 5, and $530,000 of lost future revenue from the parking
lot violates Fiscal Policy 32.  The City
Council was falsely told that there would be no additional impact to the City’s
general fund and questions of what information the City Council received are
factual inquiries.  Opp. at 12-13.
            The
court agrees that the adequacy of the LADOT General Manager’s report in lieu of
the Fiscal Report is a factual question that cannot be resolved on demurrer.
            For
the reasons stated, the demurrer to the seventh cause of action is sustained
for failure to state a claim.
            
            D.
Approval Required by the General Manager of Recreation and Parks (Eighth Cause
of Action)
1. The FAP’s
Allegations
The
eighth cause of action seeks declaratory relief and mandamus, alleging that the
Project was not approved by the General Manager of the Department of Recreation
and Parks (sometimes “General Manager”) as required by LAAC section 8.59.  FAP, ¶¶ 110-15.
The Project violates LAAC section 8.59, a
component of LAAC Chapter 3, “Local Emergencies,” which establishes a Public
Welfare and Shelter Division.  FAP, ¶111.  FTC is informed and believes, and based
thereon alleges, that the General Manager of the Department of Recreation and
Parks was not consulted for the planning or implementation of the Project.  LAAC section 8.59 exists to ensure efficient
and organized responses to such situations. 
CD 5 and the City exceeded their authority and otherwise committed ultra vires acts by planning and
implementing a homeless shelter project without following the procedures prescribed
in LAAC section 8.59.  The bypassing of
the General Manager of the Department of Recreation and Parks as the
responsible authority for coordinating sheltering services renders the Project
and its approvals illegal. FAP, ¶112.
 
2. Analysis
LAAC section 8.59 (Public Welfare and Shelter Division) provides:
“The Public Welfare and Shelter Division shall be under and subject to the
control of the Department of Recreation and Parks of the City of Los
Angeles.  The Chief of this division
shall be the General Manager of the Department. 
The chief shall be responsible for arranging, directing and coordinating
sheltering services for persons rendered homeless as a result of a local
emergency.”  
The City argues that FTC cannot identify any homelessness
emergency declaration that activated LAAC section 8.28’s Emergency Operations
Organization (“EOO”) provision, and that no such declaration occurred.  LAAC section 8.33, which authorizes the Mayor
to declare the existence of a local homelessness emergency, provides that a
homelessness emergency is not subject to the other provisions of Article 3,
Chapter 3, Division 8.  These other
provisions are LAAC sections 8.27-8.32
and include LAAC section 8.28.  By the
plain language of LAAC section 8.33, the Mayor’s July 2023 local homelessness
emergency declaration did not activate the EOO set forth in LAAC section 8.28.  Consequently, the General Manager’s role as
part of the EOO was not triggered.  Dem.
at 14.
Even if LAAC section 8.33 did not exclude activation of the
EOO, only those EOO components specifically determined by the mayor are called
into service when LAAC section 8.28 is triggered.  “[T]he Emergency Operations Organization shall
be immediately activated, and all of such portions of its personnel as the
Mayor may direct shall be called into active service.”  LAAC § 8.28 (emphasis added).  FTC can point to no mayoral activation of LAAC section 8.59 or any
role for Recreation and Park’s General Manager. 
Dem at 14-15.
FTC responds that the City is factually wrong.  On December 12, 2022, the Mayor declared an
emergency under LAAC section 8.27 and explicitly
directed that the EOO be activated: “NOW, THEREFORE, I thereby declare the
existence of a local emergency and direct all Divisions of the Emergency
Operations Organization (EOO) and all other City Departments to take necessary
steps for the protection of life, health and safety in the City of Los Angeles.”  City RJN
Ex. 1, p. 56 (emphasis added).  Opp. at
14.
On July 7, 2023, the Mayor declared an emergency under LAAC section 8.33, directing as follows: “NOW,
THEREFORE, I thereby declare the existence of a local emergency on affordable
housing and homelessness and direct all City Departments to take necessary
steps for the protection of life, health and safety in the City of Los Angeles.  The Executive Directives issued by me in
response to the original declaration of emergency and its renewal shall remain
in full force and effect through the pendency of this declaration.”  City RJN
Ex. 2, p. 112 (emphasis added).  Opp. at
14.
FTC argues that activation of the EOO in the Mayor’s December
12, 2022 declaration remained in effect through the life of the LAAC section 8.33
declaration issued on July 7, 2023.  The
EOO was activated by the Mayor’s July 7 declaration, triggering the mandate
that the General Manager be in control of “arranging,
directing and coordinating sheltering services for persons rendered homeless as
a result of a local emergency.” 
LAAC §8.59 (Pet. RJN Ex. 5).  The City bypassed the General Manager in
violation of LAAC section 8.59, which renders the Project approvals
illegal.  Opp. at 14.
The
City replies that LAAC section 8.59 triggers the General Manager’s obligation
only when the Mayor activates the General Manager’s role as part of the City’s
EOO.  Unbeknownst to anyone -- certainly
not the Mayor or the General Manager -- FTC’s argues that the Mayor’s December
12, 2022 declaration activated the EOO and required the General Manager to find
shelter for the City’s homeless.  No
facts show that ever occurred.  But even
if it had, the December 2022 declaration expired on July 9, 2023 as stated in
the Mayor’s July 7, 2023 declaration, months before the City Council approved
the Midvale Project.  City RJN Ex. 2, p.
111 (“WHEREAS, on December 12, 2022, I declared the existence of a local
emergency on homelessness with a sunset of six months subject to renewal.  The City Council renewed the declaration
of emergency and established a new sunset of July 9, 2023….”) (emphasis
added).  The General Manager was never
charged with finding shelter for all of the City’s homeless and held no such
responsibility for homeless projects when the Midvale Project was approved
October 20, 2023.  Reply at 11.
The court agrees with the City.  The Mayor’s July 9 declaration stated that
the City Council renewed her December 12, 2022 declaration with a new sunset date
of July 9, 2023.  She also stated that
her previous EDs issued in response to the original declaration of emergency
and its renewal shall remain in full force and effect through the pendency of
the July 9 declaration.  The Mayor issued
six EDs between December 12, 2022 and July 9, 2023.  City RJN Ex. 1, p. 21 (¶¶ 27-31).  Neither party indicates what these directives
stated, but they are separate and distinct from the declarations.  
 
According to the Mayor’s July 7 declaration, the EDs
remained in effect but the December 2022 declaration, and its activation of the
EOO, did not.  No ED is alleged to
support activation of the General Manager’s role as part of the City’s EOO at
the time the Project was approved on October 20, 2023.
The demurrer to the eighth cause of action is sustained for
failure to state a claim.
 
E. Failure to
Comply with Asset Evaluation Framework (Ninth Cause of Action)
1. The FAP’s
Allegations
The ninth cause of
action seeks declaratory relief and mandamus, alleging that the City failed to
comply with its Asset Evaluation Framework for the Project.  FAP, ¶¶ 116-22.
The City Asset Evaluation Framework (C.F. 12-1549-S3) involves
several vital elements, including fiscal impact assessments, comprehensive
reporting on existing parking agreements (such as parking covenants and
affidavits) and the imperative consideration of the mobility, livability, and
commercial needs of the surrounding community. 
The City’s Asset Evaluation Framework advances the City’s economic
development and housing efforts by establishing a uniform procedure to evaluate
and designate City-owned properties for economic development, housing
opportunities, and/or other City purposes. 
Another goal of the Asset Evaluation Framework is to identify higher and
better uses for such properties to maximize the value of City-owned assets and
to address priority concerns such as job creation and affordable housing.  FAP, ¶117.
The City failed to undertake the required evaluation for the
repurposing of Parking Lot 707 through the Project as expressly detailed in CD
5’s adopted Amending Motion 3D of motion CF 23-0360. [8]  Although FTC submitted evidence of parking
covenants and affidavits for Lot 707, these were never disclosed to or
addressed by the Transportation Board, thereby denying due process to those
property holders.  There is no evidence that
the covenant and affidavit owners were informed of the loss of their recorded
rights.  FAP, ¶118.
The conversion of Parking Lot 707 into a homeless shelter
site has far-reaching and deleterious implications for local businesses.  The general lack of street parking after 4 p.m.
in the vicinity could inflict significant harm on commerce.  The establishment of a low-barrier homeless
shelter essentially surrounded on three sides by a single-family neighborhood
and business district also raises genuine concerns about safety and community
compatibility.  The loss of Parking Lot
707 will also result in the unavailability of the only street-level ADA parking
in the vicinity.  The City’s failure to
conduct the required Asset Evaluation Framework on these critical issues
renders the Project approvals illegal. 
FAP, ¶119.
 
2. Analysis
FTC argues that the Asset Evaluation Framework provides a
schematic of factors to be considered in the re-use of City property.  City RJN
Ex. 23, p. 436.  The City failed to
analyze the Midvale property under this framework when the City Council converted
a City-owned parking lot with 25+ spaces to interim housing.  FAP,
¶118.  Opp. at 14-15.
The City contends that the Asset Evaluation Framework
applies only where a City asset is proposed to be sold or leased to determine
whether the proceeds should be dedicated to the City’s Economic Development
Trust Fund.  The Asset Evaluation
Framework causes the City to evaluate and properly utilize funds from the lease
or sale of City property.  City RJN Ex.
23, p. 430.  The Midvale
Project will be constructed on City property and operated by the City.  City RJN Ex. 3, p. 133–34 (City Council approval); City RJN Ex. 6, pp. 169-70
(site location).  The Project will be
paid for with public funds.  City RJN Exs.
2-6. The LADOT parking lot on which the Project is located is not being sold or
leased, and the Project will not generate revenues.  Therefore, the Asset Evaluation Framework has
no relevance.  Dem. at 15; [9] Reply
at 11-12.
FTC responds that the City is not correct that the Asset
Evaluation Framework only applies to City property that is leased or sold.  The Asset Evaluation Framework specifically
contemplates municipal uses.  “4a.
MUNICIPAL USE Continued City use.”  City RJN, Ex. 23, p. 436.  The Asset Evaluation Framework was
specifically invoked for the Midvale Project by City Councilmember motion even
though a sale or lease of the parking lot property was not contemplated.  FAP ¶¶
117-19.  Opp. at 15.  Because the Asset Evaluation Framework is
applicable to the Midvale Project, and because the FAP alleges that the City
failed to comply with the Asset Evaluation Framework, the demurrer to the ninth
cause of action should be overruled. 
Opp. at 15.
The City replies that the May 2023 motion (CF 23-0360) is
not part of the same project file as the Midvale Project (23-1066).  City RJN Ex. 3, p. 133.  Nor is the motion referenced in the City
Council’s approval of the Project.  City RJN
Exs. 3-6, pp. 133- 71.  As a result, FTC fails
to establish its relevance.  Reply at 12.
The difference in project file numbers for the May 2023
motion and the Project is not controlling. The City fails to show that one City
Council file number cannot have relevance to another file.  
However, the City is correct (Reply at 12) that, assuming the
motion was adopted, its language does not show application to the City Council’s
approval of the Project. The May 2023 motion proposes that the City Council
direct the CAO that, “when conducting an initial feasibility study analyzing
LADOT parking facilities for repurposing as supportive or affordable housing as
outlined in the City’s Asset Evaluation Framework” the CAO also report on
nearby parking agreements and impacts to nearby businesses and the community “if
stipulated in the Council motion initiating the feasibility analysis.”  See Pet. RJN Ex. 6 (emphasis added).  Thus, the May 2023 motion only requires an
additional Asset Evaluation Framework impact report where a City Council
feasibility analysis report motion is adopted that directs (“if stipulated in
the Council motion”) the creation of such additional report.  FTC identifies no City Council directive
ordering the CAO to prepare the type of additional report outlined in the May
2023 motion.  
The demurrer to the ninth cause of action is sustained for
failure to state a claim.
 
F. Abatement and Exclusive Concurrent Jurisdiction
The City seeks to
abate the entire FAP, with the exception of any of the seventh to tenth causes
of action to which the demurrer is sustained. 
Dem. at 16.
 
1. Abatement
CCP section 430.10(c) expressly provides that a party may
demur where “there is another cause of action pending between the same parties
on the same cause of action.”  See People ex rel. Garamendi v.
American Autoplan, Inc., (1993) 20 Cal. App. 4th 760, 770.  The pendency of another action is classified
as a plea in abatement, and, as such, is “not favored.”  This disfavor is expressed in a number of
rules: “(1) The objection itself is strictly limited so that, whether raised by
demurrer or answer, the defendant must show that the parties, the cause of
action, and issues are identical, and that the same evidence would support the
judgment in each case. . . (2) demurrer will not be sustained if the complaint
also shows that the former action is no longer pending. . . (3) even if
objection is good demurrer should not be sustained without leave to amend and
the action should not be dismissed.”  5
Witkin, Cal. Proc., Pleading,
(4th ed. 1997) §924; California Union Ins. Co. v Trinity River
Land Co. (1980) 105 Cal App 3d 104, 108.
In determining whether another action is pending between the
same parties on the same cause of action, the facts in the two causes of action
are compared to determine what primary right has been invaded.  California follows the "primary right
theory," which holds that every judicial action must involve the following
elements: a primary right possessed by the plaintiff, and a corresponding
primary duty devolving upon the defendant; a wrong done by the defendant that
consisted of a breach of such primary right and duty; a remedial right in favor
of the plaintiff, and a remedial duty resting on the defendant springing from
this wrong; and the remedy or relief itself. Of these elements, the combined
primary right, duty, and wrong constitute the cause of action.  Bush v Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.
App. 4th 1374, 1384.  Even when a
demurrer is properly sustained on the ground of another action pending, the
proper order is to abate further proceedings pending termination of the prior
action, not an order of dismissal.  Childs
v Eltinge (1973) 29 Cal. App. 3d 843, 847-8.
            The
City argues that FTC is seeking both to enforce LAAC section 8.33, ED1, and ED3
and to have them declared invalid in claims pending in two courts at once.  In FTC 1,
FTC seeks to set aside LAAC section 8.33, ED1, and ED3 as facially invalid.  RJN Ex. 2 (FTC 1 Prayer ¶¶ 1-3).  FTC seeks to
enforce those same enactments in this action.  FAP, ¶98 (Project contracts longer than one
year are not allowed by LAAC section 8.33); FAP, ¶¶ 3, 27, 67, 68, 70, (ED1
prevents the Midvale Project because it is in a residential zone); FAP, ¶¶ 5, 101
(ED3 requires competitive bidding for Project agreements).  This entire action must be abated and stayed
until Department 82 (now 86) adjudicates FTC’s efforts to set aside LAAC
section 8.33, ED1, and ED3 in FTC 1.  Pleading alternative theories is allowed,
however a petitioner must assert them in a single action.  See Lambert
v. Southern Counties Gas Co. of Cal., (“Lambert”) (1959) 52 Cal.2d
347, 352 [“[A]
plaintiff may plead inconsistent causes of action in separate counts of a
single complaint.”]).  FTC is not
entitled to see dueling court orders that both strike and enforce LAAC section
8.33, ED1, and ED3.  Pursuant to CCP section 430.10(c) and
the primary right theory of pleading, the FAP action must be stayed until FTC
1’s claims concerning the validity of LAAC section 8.33, ED1, and ED3 are
finally adjudicated.  Dem. at 15-16.
            In seeking abatement, the City contends that FTC’s pending
actions both assert two primary rights and legal wrongs: (1) the Midvale
Project was unlawfully approved and (2) Midvale Project agreements were
unlawfully awarded for failure to competitively bid them.  In FTC 1, FTC seeks to set aside LAAC
section 8.33, ED1, and ED3.  In this
case, FTC seeks to enforce LAAC section 8.33, ED1, and ED3 to substantiate
these causes of action.  The City
concludes that FTC has split the same primary rights between two courts.  Dem. at 17.[10]
            As
FTC argues (Opp. at 10), the primary rights differ in FTC 1 and this case.  FTC 1 seeks to set aside, inter
alia, LAAC section 8.33, the Mayor’s July 7, 2023 declaration issued under
LAAC section 8.33, and EDs 1 and 3.  This
case challenges the October 20, 2023 approval of the Midvale Project based on
state and local laws without any challenge to LAAC section 8.33 and the
EDs.  The harm to City residents alleged
in FTC 1 is the unlawful grant of authority to the Mayor to declare an
emergency for chronic issues that do not qualify as an emergency and do not
justify the granting of extraordinary executive powers that suspend normal
governmental processes.  The harm to City
residents alleged in the instant case is the approval of the Project that places
a low-barrier navigation center without mandatory safe parking (Govt. Code §8698.4(c)(1)) on a site that is
not a “public facility” as defined by Govt.
Code section 8698.1(c), in a residential community on R1-zoned property, that
deprives the local businesses necessary parking and eliminates ADA parking in the area, and forsakes an
estimated $530,000 in parking revenue, all of which the City failed to evaluate
under mandatory City codes.  This harm only
arose after the filing of FTC 1 on September
25, 2023.  The primary rights and primary
wrongs are clearly different.  
 
2. Exclusive
Concurrent Jurisdiction
“Under the rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction, when
two superior courts have concurrent jurisdiction over the subject matter and
the parties, the first court to assume jurisdiction has exclusive and
continuing jurisdiction until such time as all necessarily related matters have
been resolved.”  Lawyers Title Ins.
Corp. v. Superior Court, (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 455, 460.  The rule applies “to avoid unseemly conflict
between courts that might arise if they were free to make contradictory
decisions or awards at the same time or relating to the same controversy;
another reason is to protect litigants from the expense and harassment of
multiple litigation.” Scott v. Industrial Acc. Commission,
(1956) 46 Cal.2d 76, 81–82. The remedies in the suits need not be
precisely the same; rather, the issues in the two proceedings must be
substantially similar and the suits must have the potential to result in
conflicting judgments.  County of
Siskiyou v. Superior Court, (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 83, 91.
“Although the rule of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction is
similar in effect to the statutory plea in abatement, it has been interpreted
and applied more expansively, and therefore may apply where the narrow grounds
required for a statutory plea [in] abatement do not exist.”  People ex rel. Garamendi v. American
Autoplan, Inc., (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 760, 770 (emphasis added; citation omitted).  Unlike the statutory plea abatement, the rule
of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction does not require absolute identity of
parties, causes of action or remedies sought in the initial and subsequent
actions. Id.   If the court
exercising original jurisdiction has the power to bring before it all the
necessary parties, the fact that the parties in the second action are not
identical does not preclude application of the rule.  Id. 
Moreover, the remedies sought in the separate actions need not be
precisely the same so long as the court exercising original jurisdiction has
the power to litigate all the issues and grant all the relief to which any of
the parties might be entitled under the pleadings.  Id.  See also Plant Insulation Co. v. Fibreboard Corp., (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 781, 788.  
“Although their
claimed rights and therefore their causes of action are distinct, the issues
are substantially the same, and individual suits might result in conflicting
judgments.”  County of Siskiyou v. Superior Court
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 83, 89 (italics omitted).  “[T]he issues in the two proceedings must be
substantially the same and the individual suits must have the potential to
result in conflicting judgments.”  Id. at 91 (citation omitted).
            The City contends that the FAP’s claims seeking to
enforce LAAC section 8.33, ED1, and ED3 would be fully resolved by a ruling in FTC
1 that those enactments are not valid.  The FAP’s fourth cause of action alleges that
ED1 regulates any City low barrier navigation center (the City did not rely ED1
for the Midvale Project).  This claim cannot
proceed if ED1 is set aside in FTC 1. 
The fifth cause of action alleges a violation of ED3’s
requirements.  The sixth cause of action alleges
competitive bidding violations of ED3 and LAAC section 8.33, and the eighth
cause of action asserts non-compliance with EOO rules triggered by LAAC section
8.33.  Even the tenth cause of action under
CEQA involves the City’s emergency enactments challenged in FTC 1
because the City cited the Mayor’s homelessness emergency declaration as
support for the Pub. Res. Code section 21080(b)(4) exemption in the NOE.  City RJN Ex. 5, p. 151.  Dem.
at 18-19; Reply at 8-9.[11]  
            The City notes the
potential for conflicting judgments.  Contrary to the FAP’s sixth cause of action’s contention about competitive
bidding, the City will argue that LAAC section 8.33 allows the City to
sole-source the Midvale Project agreements. 
FTC will be able to respond by challenging the facial validity of LAAC
section 8.33, the same issue it is litigating in FTC 1.  Dem. at 18-19.
The issues between
the cases are not substantially the same. See County of Siskiyou v. Superior Court, supra, 217 Cal.App.4th at 89.  FTC
correctly argues that the instant case arises from a different transaction and
events than FTC 1.  FTC
1 concerns legislative and executive actions that occurred prior to
approval of the Midvale Project and filing of this case.  FTC also alleges CEQA violations in this case
which have nothing to do with FTC 1. 
Opp. at 11.
Although the issues
are not substantially the same, there is a prospect of inconsistent
rulings.  FTC 1 challenges the
validity of LAAC section 8.33, ED1, and ED3. While the instant case does
not challenge those enactments, it does assume their validity as part of the
reason why the Project approval should be set aside.  If FTC 1 upholds their validity, there
will be no impact on this case.  If FTC
1 declares any of the enactments invalid, it could affect the reasoning of
this case.  For this reason, the court
has stated that it will delay the trial of this case pending the outcome of FTC
1.  This delay is not based on the
exclusive concurrent jurisdiction rule, however, and the court may end the
delay if FTC 1 is delayed too long. 
In other words, the court will maintain flexibility on the trial of this
case.  
The court also agrees with the City that the entire case
should be delayed.  September 25, 2023.  Although causes of action one through three
and seven through nine do not seek to enforce the challenged emergency homeless
enactments, they should be included in the stay pursuant to the court’s broad
powers to set procedures for writ matters. 
CCP §187; Voices
of the Wetlands v. State Water Resources Control Bd., (2011) 52 Cal.4th 499, 526.  Otherwise, there could be multiple trials
that waste judicial resources.  
FTC argues that there
is a practical reason not to delay the instant case.  If a decision in FTC 1 is delayed -- the
City’s demurrer in FTC 1 was recently continued from March 28 to April
25, 2024, suggesting that FTC 1 may not be resolved soon -- a decision
in this case is necessary as the Midvale Project is proceeding with City
actions and contracts.  Opp. at 11.
The City correctly responds that FTC created the situation
mandating a delay.  Although FTC1
action was filed first, the Petition in this case, filed on December 5, 2023,
re-asserted those facial challenges and alternatively sought to enforce them if
the court found them valid.  This was
permissible.  Lambert,
supra, 52 Cal.2d at 352.  Rather
than dismiss FTC 1 and litigate its claims in this action, FTC filed the
FAP deleting its facial challenges to the City’s homeless emergency enactments
from this action.  This placed FCT’s facial
challenges to the emergency actions before Department 86 and its reliance on
them in this case.  Having created the
situation, FTC cannot complain about the delay. 
Reply at 9.
The court will not stay this case but will delay the trial
for the outcome of FTC 1.  This
delay is not based on the exclusive concurrent jurisdiction rule, and the court
may end the delay if FTC 1 is delayed too long.  In other words, the court will maintain
flexibility on the trial of this case.
 
            G. Conclusion
The demurrer is sustained for the seventh through tenth causes
of action.  The trial will be delayed awaiting
the outcome of FTC 1, but the court will monitor the progress of that
case and may end the delay in its discretion.
 
VI. Motion to Strike
The City seeks to
strike the FAP’s allegations (1) that the Public Contract Code governs the
City’s competitive bids, (2) of a non-existent Govt. Code section, and (3) concerning
the Midvale Project service provider agreement.[12]

 
A. Applicable Law
            Any
party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading, may serve and file a
notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.  CCP §435(b)(1).  CCP section 436 permits the court to strike
out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter, as well as any part of any
pleading not in conformity with an order of the court.  Irrelevant matters are defined as those
allegations that are not essential to the statement of a claim or that are
neither pertinent nor supported by an otherwise sufficient claim.  CCP §431.10(b).
            The
notice of motion to strike shall be given within the time allowed to plead, and
if a demurrer is interposed, concurrently therewith, and shall be noticed for
hearing and heard at the same time as the demurrer.  CRC 3.1322(b).  The notice of motion to strike a portion of a
pleading shall quote in full the portions sought to be stricken except where
the motion is to strike an entire paragraph, cause of action, count or defense.  CRC 3.1322(a).
            A
motion to strike can serve an important function of deleting matter for which a
defendant may not be able to demur but for which the defendant should not have
to suffer discovery and navigate the thicket of proceedings for summary
adjudication.  Ph II, Inc. v. Superior
Court, (1995) 33 Cal.app.4th 1680, 1682-83.  The grounds for a motion to strike shall
appear on the face of the challenged pleading or from any matter of which the
court is required to take judicial notice. 
CCP §437(a).  Matter to be
judicially noticed shall be specified in the notice of motion.  CCP §437(b). 
When the defect which justifies striking a complaint is capable of cure,
the court should allow leave to amend.  Perlman
v. Municipal Court, (1979) 99 Cal. App. 3d 568, 575.
 
B.
Public Contract Code 
The City moves to
strike the FAP’s allegations concerning the Public Contract Code’s competitive
bidding requirements (1) in the sixth cause of action’s title and
(2) paragraph 85 in its entirety, paragraph 86 at lines 14-15 (“as well as
Public Contracts Code Section 20162”), and paragraph 89 at line 22 (“Public
Contracts Code Section 20162”).  Mot. at 2.  
“[The
Public Contract Code] is the basis of contracts between most public entities in
this state and their contractors and subcontractors.  With regard to charter cities, this code
applies in the absence of an express exemption or a city charter provision or
ordinance that conflicts with the relevant provision of this code.”  Public Contract Code §1100.7.  
            The
City argues that it is a charter city and the Public Contract Code’s
competitive bidding provisions do not control it.  Public Contract Code section 1100.7
expressly exempts cities whose charter contains conflicting contracting
provisions and City Charter sections 370-78 do just that.  City RJN Ex. 26.  See also LAAC §10.15 (City RJN Ex. 2).  As the City Charter conflicts with the
Public Contract Code, the latter is inapplicable to the City’s contracts.  Mot. at 6.
            The
courts also hold that a city’s public contracting is a municipal affair
pursuant to the constitutional home rule doctrine.  Thus, pursuant to Article 5 of the California
Constitution, all authority over a charter city’s contracting is governed
by local law where local law exists.  The
issue whether state bidding provisions bind charter cities was addressed and
decided in Smith v. City
of Riverside, (“Smith”) (1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 529, 537, in which
the court held that the mode of contracting work in the city was a municipal
rather than a statewide concern and a Government Code bidding procedure did not
apply.  Id.  No developments in this area of the law in
the ten years after Smith
was decided vitiated that ruling.  Piledrivers’ Local Union v.
City of Santa Monica, (“Piledrivers”)
(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 509, 511–12. Likewise, nothing has changed in
the 40 years since Piledrivers
was decided.  Thus, the Public Contract
Code regulation of bidding is inapplicable to the City and the FAP’s allegations
that any award of a City contract violates the requirements of the Public
Contract Code must be stricken as irrelevant. 
Mot. at 7.
FTC
notes that the City is not exempt from competitive bidding.  City Charter section 370 states: “Every contract involving
consideration reasonably valued at more than an amount specified by ordinance
shall, except in cases of urgent necessity for the preservation of life, health
or property as provided in Section
371(e)(5), be made in writing, or other manner as provided by ordinance.”  
City Charter
section 371(a) then specifies: “Except
as provided in subsection (e) below,
the City shall not be, and is not, bound by any contract unless the officer,
board or employee authorized to contract has complied with the procedure for
competitive bidding or submission of proposals established by this section
and ordinance.”  (emphasis added).  Opp. at 5.
City Charter
section 371(e)(6) provides an exemption
from competitive bidding for “[c]ontracts entered into during time of war or
national, state or local emergency declared in accordance with federal, state
or local law, where the Council, by resolution adopted by two-thirds vote
and approved by the Mayor, suspends
any or all of the restrictions of this section or their applicability to
specific boards, officers or employees.” 
(emphasis added).  
FTC
argues that the City cannot point to a vote by the City Council suspending
competitive bidding for the Midvale Project. 
Similarly, there is no order or action from the Mayor under LAAC section
8.33 to suspend competitive bidding for the Midvale Project.  Opp. at 5-6.
FTC argues
that the holding in Piledrivers, supra,
151 Cal.App.3d at 511-12, does not
grant the City general immunity from the Public
Contract Code.  Howard Contracting, Inc. v. G. A. MacDonald
Construction Co. (1998) 71
Cal.App.4th 38, 51, is on point.  In that
case, the City lost its home rule argument because it failed to establish a
conflict between the Public Contract Code
and any charter provision or municipal enactment.  Similarly, no conflict exists here because
the potential exemption does not apply. 
The City cannot show any vote suspending competitive bidding for Midvale
or in the relevant time period.  The
FAP’s allegations concerning competitive bidding violations are appropriate and
should not be stricken.  Opp. at 6.
FTC misreads the
City’s argument.  The City is not arguing
that competitive bidding is not required for the Project.  Rather, the City contends that the City
Charter’s competitive bidding requirements govern the City’s contracts, and the
Public Contract Code does not.  Nonetheless,
the City is wrong to conclude that, just because it has its own competitive
bidding requirements, all Public Contract Code provisions concerning
competitive bidding necessarily conflict with the City’s competitive bidding
requirements.  As a charter city, the
City is not governed by the Public Contract Code competitive bidding
requirements where they conflict.  City Charter section 371 and LAAC section
10.15 govern the City’s contracting process. 
The City fails to show the FAP’s specific references to the Public
Contract Code are provisions that conflict with the City Charter and LAAC.
 
C. Non-Existent Govt. Code Section 
The City moves to
strike the FAP’s reference to Govt. Code section 8698(c)(5) in FAP paragraphs 80
(entirety) and 83, line 23 (“and Govt. Code Section 8698(c)(5)”) because no
such provision of law exists. 
FTC responds that the City’s counsel was
advised in the meet-and-confer that the intended citation is Govt. Code section
8698.1(c)(5), not to 8698(c)(5).  Govt. Code section 8698.1(c)(5) provides: “No new permits shall be authorized
pursuant to this subdivision on and after January 1, 2023.”  FTC filed a Notice of Errata for this purpose on
March 18, 2024.  The City’s argument over
an obvious typo that was discussed in the meet-and-confer unnecessarily
consumes the court’s time and resources. 
There is no reason to strike any part of FAP ¶80. 
Opp. at 7.
The court agrees.  The Notice of Errata cured the defect.
 
D. Service Provider Agreements
The City moves to
strike all allegations concerning a Midvale Project service provider agreement:
(1) Paragraphs 97 and 98 (asserting, on information and belief, facts
concerning the award of the Midvale Project’s service agreement which has not
yet been awarded); (2) Paragraph 85 at lines 9-11 (“Petitioner is
informed and believes and based thereon alleges that the City never issued
Requests for Proposals or Requests for Qualifications for the Project.”); (3) Paragraph
87 at lines 16-18 (“Petitioner is informed and believes that the City failed
to proceed with the competitive bidding process with…LA Family Housing, which
Petitioner is informed and believes the City has selected as the provider of
the…operator”); (4) Paragraph 98 at lines 24-26 (“In addition,
Petitioner is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that the City
and/or Council District 5 intend that the service contract for the Project will
continue for as long as 10 years.”); (5) Paragraph 129 at lines 12-16 (“[I]t
is anticipated that a 10-year lease or similar operating and/or funding
agreements may be executed in the future with the service provider, County,
and/or LAHSA.  In the future, the City
may execute a lease or similar operating and/or funding agreements with the
service provider, County, and/or LAHSA.”). 
Mot. at 2-4.
The City argues
that these allegations in the FAP seek to set aside an alleged City service
provider contract with LA Family Housing for operation of the Midvale Project
low barrier navigation center.  No such
contract exists.  Even the FAP admits
that FTC does not know whether a service provider agreement has been
executed.  See FAP, ¶97.  At most, the FAP asserts that it would be
unlawful if a service agreement is awarded without competitive bidding. That is
the very essence of an unripe claim seeking an advisory opinion that must be
struck.  See Pacific Legal
Foundation v. California Coastal Com., (1982) 33 Cal.3d 158, 170–71.  Moreover, no service agreement has been
awarded and proposals from service providers are being solicited through a
competitive bidding process run by LAHSA for the City.  City RJN Exs. 20-22.  Mot. at 8.           Nor
are the FAP’s contentions concerning the Midvale Project service agreement
sufficient to create a disputed question of fact because they are all alleged
upon information and belief without disclosing the basis of FTC’s belief.  A “‘[p]laintiff may allege on information and
belief any matters that are not within his personal knowledge, if he has
information leading him to believe that the allegations are true’” [citation],
and thus a pleading made on information and belief is insufficient if it
“merely assert[s] the facts so alleged without alleging such information that
‘lead[s] [the plaintiff] to believe that the allegations are true.’” Gomes
v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1158-59
(citation omitted).  No Project service
agreement exists and the facts subject to judicial notice show that process is
pending and will occur via competitive bidding.  Mot. at 9-10.
FTC responds that
the Midvale project was shrouded in secrecy until it was announced to the
public as a “done deal.”  FAP, ¶2. 
Given that secrecy, plus the information the City belatedly and
contradictorily released through California Public
Records Act responses, FTC alleged on information and belief that L.A. Family
Housing had or would receive the service provider contract for the Midvale
Project.  “‘Plaintiff may allege on
information and belief any matters that are not within his personal knowledge,
if he has information leading him to believe that the allegations are
true.’  [Citation.]”  Doe
v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.  The City also seeks to strike those
information and belief allegations, claiming they are not true or do not give
rise to a justiciable controversy, relying upon the City’s RJN Exhibits 20-22,
which are documents concerning a purported Request for Proposals (“RFP”) (the
alleged truth of which cannot be judicially noticed) released on February 16,
2024, seven days prior to filing of the FAP.  Opp. at 9.
Lack of ripeness is not a basis to strike an
allegation.  Additionally, the RFP
exhibits (Exs. 20-22) do not necessarily establish the falsity of the FAP’s allegations.  Judicial
notice of official acts of a government agency does not mean that the court may
accept the truth of factual matters in the document since it is the existence
of the contents, not their truth, which is subject to notice.  Cruz v. County of Los Angeles, supra,
173 Cal.App.3d at 1134.  The RFP
exhibits show the existence of a competitive bidding process but do not
eliminate FTC’s suspicion (Opp. at 9) that they are a sham.  They do not prove that the FAP’s allegations
on information and belief about an award of the service provider contract to
L.A. Family Housing are false, and the same is true of the allegations on
information and belief that the service provider contract would have a length
of ten years.  
However, the adequacy of a pleading’s allegation on
information and belief is a ground for a motion to strike.  See Gomes v. Countrywide Home
Loans, Inc., supra, 192 Cal.App.4th at 1158-59.  The FAP does not allege the basis which leads
FTC to believe the information and belief allegations to be true.  The motion to strike is granted on this
ground.
 
E. Conclusion
The motion to strike is granted with respect to the FAP’s
allegations about a Midvale service provider agreement and otherwise is denied.
