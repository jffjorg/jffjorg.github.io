Curtis Kin has since been reassigned to Department 86.  Accordingly, FTC 1 is now assigned to
Department 86.

The City’s demurrer does not rely
on the exemption in Pub. Res. Code section 21080(b)(4), but the City explains that it has not abandoned the emergency exemption.  Reply at 8.
 


[3] When
HHAP Round 1 grants were statutorily
authorized, “navigation center” was defined as “a Housing First, low-barrier,
service-enriched shelter focused on moving homeless individuals and families
into permanent housing that provides temporary living facilities while case
managers connect individuals experiencing homelessness to income, public
benefits, health services, shelter, and housing.”  RJN Ex. 28 (H&S Code §50216(n),
effective June 31, 2019 to June 29, 2020).  The definition remains the same today.  H&S Code §50216(o).   Dem. at 11-12.

The City suggests that FTC seeks to impose the cost of gathering and preparing
a CEQA record of tens of thousands of emails and their attachments that will
have no bearing on whether this CEQA exemption applies, sapping City staff time
from work on other housing crisis projects. Reply at 3.


            [5] FTC opines that the City’s confusion on this cause of
action appears to be related to the fact that the City included AB 1197 in its
analysis of the section 20180.27 exemption. 
AB 1197 was the former iteration of section 21080.27. 
AB 785 substantially changed section 21080.27,
effective January 1, 2024, with different definitions and different required
findings.  Opp. at 19.
The City explains that the Project’s low-barrier navigation
center expressly was designed to meet the requirements of the section 21080.27
exemption.  FTC’s position is hinged solely
upon section 21080.27(e), which are prevailing wage law requirements for
construction contracts added two months after the City Council’s CEQA
determination for the Midvale Project.  Section 21080.27(e) took effect on January 1,
2024 -- two months after the City’s October 20, 2023, Midvale approval.  City RJN Ex. 3, p. 133.  Subsection (e) was not added to section
21080.27 until September 8, 2023, a mere five days before AB 785 was approved
by the Legislature and month prior to the Governor’s signature.  City Reply RJN Exs. 35 (bill history), 36 (prevailing
wage amendment), and 37 (governor approval).  Reply at 4.


            [6]
As the City argues, section 21080.27(e)
addresses only construction and rehabilitation contracts, not all housing
crisis project contracts (such as contracts to operate the project).  FTC’s definition would require a project
sponsor to certify that it will pay prevailing wages for a public work contract
even where the housing crisis project involves no contract (e.g., an
entitlement).  Reply at 5.


            [7] Although it does not bear on the existence of substantial
evidence on demurrer, the City notes that whether a CEQA exemption applies is
not limited to facts stated in an NOE because a lead agency can prove that a
never-asserted exemption applies as a defense to a CEQA challenge.  See Del Cerro Mobile Estates v.
City of Placentia, (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 173, 179; Erven v. Board of Supervisors, (1975) 53 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.  Reply at 7-8.


[8] The
motion reads:  “I FURTHER
MOVE that the CAO, when conducting an initial feasibility study analyzing
LADOT parking facilities for repurposing as supportive or affordable housing as
outlined in the City’s Asset Evaluation Framework (C.F. 12-1549-S3) also
include a report on the existence of any parking agreements between the
city and surrounding businesses and the fiscal impacts of the potential
repurposing, as well as contemplation of the mobility, livability, and
commercial needs of the nearby community if stipulated in the Council motion
initiating the feasibility analysis.”  Pet.
RJN Ex. 6 (emphasis added).  Opp. at 15,
n. 1.
In objecting to FTC’s request for
judicial notice of this motion, the City argues (Reply at 12) that this is an unauthenticated
and lacks proof that the City Council ever adopted it.  True, and the court sustained the City’s
objection to this request.  Nonetheless,
the FAP pleads the existence of this motion (FAP, ¶118), which must be accepted
as true on demurrer.  The wording of the
motion is not in the FAP, however, and the court considers its language only
for purposes of argument.


[9]
The citations in the City’s moving papers do not comport with its RJN exhibits.


            [10] The City adds that, although FTC filed its initial
action September 25, 2023, a little less than a month prior to the Midvale
Project’s final approval on October 20, 2023, nothing prevented FTC from
amending FTC 1 to assert its alternative counts in a single action.  FTC was well aware of the Midvale Project when
it filed the FTC 1 complaint on September 25, 2023.  See RJN Ex. 9.  Dem. at 17-18.


            [11]
The City adds that,
once FTC 1 is decided in the merits, it may be entitled to assert that
all of the FAP’s counts are barred by res judicata and collateral
estoppel.  See Busick v. Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd., (1972) 7 Cal.3d 967, 974 (res judicata bars litigation of issues that could
have been presented as well as those that were litigated).  Dem. at 19. 
These potential bars are not a reason to stay.


[12]
The City objects to the declarations supporting FTC’s opposition.  The objections are sustained.  See CCP §437(a).
