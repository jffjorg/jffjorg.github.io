And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The City's demurrer is not based on the exemption in Pub. Res. Code section 21080(b)(4), but the City explains that it has not abandoned the emergency exemption. The City suggests that FTC seeks to impose the cost of gathering and preparing a CEQA record of tens of thousands of emails and their attachments that will have no bearing on whether this CEQA exemption applies. The City argues that section 21080.27(e) addresses only construction and rehabilitation contracts, not all housing crisis project contracts. The City notes that whether a CEQA exemption applies is not limited to facts stated in an NOE because a lead agency can prove that a never-asserted exemption applies as a defense to a CEQA challenge. The City objects to FTC's request for judicial notice of a motion and adds that FTC could have amended its complaint to assert alternative counts in a single action. The City also objects to the declarations supporting FTC's opposition and adds that FTC may be entitled to assert that all of the FAP's counts are barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel.
