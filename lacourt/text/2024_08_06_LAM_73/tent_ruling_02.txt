I. BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff
Eric Kaufman brings this action for declaratory relief against Defendants
Lockton Investment Advisors, LLC ("LIA"), Lockton Investment
Securities, LLC, f/k/a Lockton Financial Advisors, LLC ("LIS"), and
Lockton Companies, LLC - Pacific Series ("Pacific Series",
collectively "Lockton").
 
LIA provides investment advisory and related
services, LIS buys and sells securities as a registered broker dealer, and
Pacific Series provides insurance and risk management services. (FAC, ¶ 10.)
Kaufman became a producer member of LIA in approximately July 2007 and a
producer member in LIS and Pacific Series in approximately July 2008. (FAC, ¶
23.) To become a producer member of LIA, LIS, and Pacific Services, Kaufman
paid a $200 capital contribution for a single "Producer Unit" in each
entity. (FAC, ¶ 23.) As of May 1, 2016, Plaintiff entered into an “Amended and
Restated Member Agreement" with Pacific Series and with LIS and, as of May
1, 2016, a "Second Amended and Restated Member Agreement” with LIA
(collectively the "Member Agreements"). (FAC, ¶ 16.)
 
The Member
Agreements include nonsolicitation covenants. (FAC, ¶ 20.) The
Member Agreements include Missouri choice of law and Missouri forum selection
clauses. The Member Agreements require Kaufman to adjudicate disputes in the
federal court in Kansas City, Missouri or in the Circuit Court of Jackson
County, Missouri. (FAC, ¶ 18.) he Member Agreements for LIA, LIS, and Pacific
Series require Plaintiff to provide thirty days written notice of termination.
(FAC, ¶ 22.)
 
Kaufman
withdrew from and terminated his membership in LIA, LIS, and Pacific Series on
July 18, 2022. (FAC, ¶ 27.) Kaufman subsequently accepted employment with
Alliant, a California-based competitor of Lockton. (FAC, ¶ 28.) At Alliant,
Kaufman will provide products and services that are directly competitive with
the products or services of Lockton. (Ibid.) 
In the first amended complaint, Kaufman asserts a single cause of
action for declaratory relief, seeking a judicial declaration that the
nonsolicitation covenants, Missouri choice of law and forum selection clauses,
and notice requirements are void and unenforceable as a violation of Business
and Professions Code Sections 16600 and California public policy. Kaufman
alleges: Plaintiff desires a judicial declaration that the enforcement of the
Missouri Choice of Law and Missouri Forum Section Provisions would violate
California's fundamental public policy in favor of workplace mobility and
competition. Plaintiff also desires a judicial declaration that the Notice
Provision, Member Agreements Non-Competition Covenants and the December 2021
Non-Competition Covenants are facially void under Business and Professions Code
Section 16600 and California public policy in favor of workplace mobility and
open competition are thereby unenforceable as to Plaintiff. (FAC, ¶ 40.) 
 
On
April 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Conditionally Seal
Documents Submitted in Plaintiff’s Opposition to Motion for Reconsideration of
12/13/23 Order Denying Motion to Dismiss or for Order Revoking 12/13/23 Order
Denying Motion to Dismiss and Staying Proceedings. 
 
On
April 19, 2024, Defendants filed the instant Motion to Seal: (1) Plaintiff’s
Opposition to Motion for Reconsideration of 12/13/23 Order Denying Motion to
Dismiss or for Order Revoking 12/13/23 Order Denying Motion to Dismiss and
Staying Proceedings; (2) Exhibit 12 to Gerber Declaration in Support of
Plaintiff’s Opposition; and (3) Exhibit 13 to Gerber Declaration in Support of
Plaintiff’s Opposition. 
 
No oppositions have been filed.
 
II.
DISCUSSION
 
“Unless
confidentiality is required by law, court records are presumed to be open.”
(Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 2.550(c).) However, a party may move to seal records
pursuant to California Rules of Court, rules 2.550-2.551. “A party requesting
that a record be filed under seal must file a motion or an application for an
order sealing the record. The motion or application must be accompanied by a
memorandum and a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify the
sealing.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b).) To grant an order pursuant to
California Rules of Court, rules 2.550 and 2.551, the Court must expressly find
facts that establish:  
 
(1)
There exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access
to the record; 
(2)
The overriding interest supports sealing the record; 
(3)
A substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be
prejudiced if the record is not sealed; 
(4)
The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and 
(5)
No less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest. 
 
(Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 2.550(d).)  
 
On
April 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Conditionally Seal
Documents Submitted in Plaintiff’s Opposition to Motion for Reconsideration of
12/13/23 Order Denying Motion to Dismiss or for Order Revoking 12/13/23 Order
Denying Motion to Dismiss and Staying Proceedings. 
 
On
April 19, 2024, Defendants filed the instant Motion to Seal: (1) Plaintiff’s
Opposition to Motion for Reconsideration of 12/13/23 Order Denying Motion to
Dismiss or for Order Revoking 12/13/23 Order Denying Motion to Dismiss and
Staying Proceedings; (2) Exhibit 12 to Gerber Declaration in Support of
Plaintiff’s Opposition; and (3) Exhibit 13 to Gerber Declaration in Support of
Plaintiff’s Opposition. 
 
The
parties request the Court seal these documents pursuant to
the April 19, 2023 Protective Order entered by the court in Lockton Cos.,
LLC, et al. v. Kaufman, Case No. 4:22- cv-00461-SRB (W.D. Mo.). (Declaration
of Seth Gerber, Exs. 11-13). The April 19, 2023 Protective Order provides that
“[a] Party seeking to make a Confidential Filing must comply with the
provisions of . . . the presiding California Court[] in filing a document under
seal.” (Gerber Decl., Ex. 1.) Under Rule 2.551(b)(3), a “party that files or
intends to file with the court, for the purposes of adjudication or to use at
trial, records produced in discovery that are subject to a confidentiality
agreement or protective order, and does not intend to request to have the
records sealed, must: 
 
(i) Lodge the
unredacted records subject to the confidentiality agreement or protective order
and any pleadings, memorandums, declarations, and other documents that disclose
the contents of the records, in the manner stated in (d) [below]; 
(ii) File
copies of the documents in (i) that are redacted so that they do not disclose
the contents of the records that are subject to the confidentiality agreement
or protective order; and 
(iii) Give
written notice to the party that produced the records that the records and the
other documents lodged under (i) will be placed in the public court file unless
that party files a timely motion or application to seal the records under this
rule.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(3).)
 
Subdivision
(d) of Rule 2.551 provides in pertinent part that a record that may be filed
under seal “must be put in an envelope or other appropriate container, sealed
in the envelope or container,” marked “CONDITIONALLY UNDER SEAL” and lodged
with the Court. (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 2.551(d).) Further, the party
submitting the lodged record must affix to the envelope or container a cover
sheet that contains “all the information required on a caption page under rule
2.111;” and “[s]tates that the enclosed record is subject to a motion or an
application to file the record under seal.” (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiff requests
the Court conditionally file the documents
submitted in Plaintiff’s Opposition to Motion for Reconsideration of 12/13/23
Order, under
seal. Plaintiff asserts the documents at issue cite to or contain deposition testimony
designated by Lockton as “Confidential.” The federal Protective Order directs
the parties to file any document subject to the Protective Order under seal in
this California state court action.
 
Defendants move
the Court to Seal: (1) Plaintiff’s Opposition to
Motion for Reconsideration of 12/13/23 Order; (2) Exhibit 12 to Gerber
Declaration in Support of Plaintiff’s Opposition; and (3) Exhibit 13 to Gerber
Declaration in Support of Plaintiff’s Opposition. 
 
Plaintiff
filed his motion to conditionally seal these documents on April 10, 2024.
Pursuant to Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(3)(B), if Defendants “file[] a
motion or an application to seal within 10 days or such later time as the court
has ordered, these documents are to remain conditionally under seal until the
court rules on the motion or application and thereafter are to be filed as
ordered by the court.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(3)(B).) Defendants’
motion to seal is timely under this rule.
 
Defendants
argue the
documents at issue warrant sealing under California Rule of Court 2.550 because
they include highly confidential Lockton information, including highly
confidential internal communications regarding (1) the rationale behind various
terms in Lockton’s Operating Agreements and various other agreements, (2) the
rationale for the structure of Lockton’s Executive Committee and (3) the
negotiation of contract terms with non-partners, the disclosure of which would
cause substantial competitive harm to Lockton and no less restrictive means
exist to prevent this harm. (Skinner Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.) 
 
The
parties do not dispute that the documents should be sealed. Based on the
foregoing, the Court grants the parties’ requests.
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion to Conditionally Seal Documents Submitted in
Plaintiff’s Opposition to Motion for Reconsideration of 12/13/23 Order Denying
Motion to Dismiss or for Order Revoking 12/13/23 Order Denying Motion to
Dismiss and Staying Proceedings.
