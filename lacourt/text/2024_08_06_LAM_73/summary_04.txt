Significant Statements:
  - "Defendants are entitled to judgment pursuant to CCP § 1172 because they have been in possession of the Property for more than one year before Plaintiff filed this action."
  - "As a matter of law, where a defendant has resided in the subject property for a period exceeding one year, the plaintiff is barred from bringing a claim for a forcible detainer under CCP § 1172."
```

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Defendants' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED. The Court finds that the Defendants have established a defense under CCP § 1172, as it appears they have been in possession of the Premises for more than a year before the Plaintiff filed this action.
