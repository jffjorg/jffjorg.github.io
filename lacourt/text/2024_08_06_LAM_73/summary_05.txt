```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment in this forcible detainer action. The defendants have established a defense under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1172, which provides that a defendant can establish a one-year quiet possession defense by showing that they have been in possession of the property for more than one year before the plaintiff filed the action. The defendants have provided evidence that they have been in possession of the property since at least 2018, and that the plaintiff has accepted rent payments from them through their manager. The plaintiff failed to file an opposition to the motion, and therefore has not met its burden of proving that there are triable issues of material fact. The judge therefore grants the defendants' motion for summary judgment.
