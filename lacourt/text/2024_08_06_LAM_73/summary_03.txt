And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's six motions to compel responses to discovery requests and for monetary sanctions. The plaintiff, Stearns Bank National Association, seeks to compel responses to its third set of form interrogatories, second set of requests for production of documents and electronically stored information, and requests for admission. The plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions against the defendants, B. Grigorovich D.D.S., Inc. and Boris Grigorovich, and their attorney, in the amount of $1,935.00.

The judge grants the plaintiff's motions to compel responses to the discovery requests, finding that the defendants have failed to respond in a timely manner. The judge also grants the plaintiff's motions for monetary sanctions, finding that the defendants' failure to respond necessitated the motion and that the requested sanctions are reasonable.

The judge orders that the defendants provide responses to the discovery requests within 20 days, and that the plaintiff provide notice of the court's order and file a proof of service. The judge also orders that the defendants pay the monetary sanctions to the plaintiff's counsel within 30 days of the date of the order.
