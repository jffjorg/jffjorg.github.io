I. BACKGROUND
 
On July 29, 2022, Plaintiff Stearns Bank National Association brought
this action against Defendants B. Grigorovich D.D.S., Inc. and Boris
Grigorovich. The Complaint alleges causes of action for:
1.      Breach of
Equipment Finance Agreement;
2.      Breach of
Equipment Finance Agreement;
3.      Breach of
Guaranty; and 
4.      Breach of
Guaranty.
 
The Complaint alleges the following. Defendants and Plaintiff
entered into two Equipment Finance Agreements and Security Agreements pursuant
to which Plaintiff agreed to provide two loans to Defendants to finance and to
be secured by medical equipment. Plaintiff alleges it has performed all terms
and conditions on its part, however, Defendants have failed to make their
payments pursuant to the loan agreements. As a result of the defaults on both
loans, Plaintiff disposed of the medical equipment by private sale in a
commercially reasonable manner. Plaintiff seeks the remaining amount now due
and payable.

II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
 When a party fails to
serve a timely response to a request for admission, the party propounding the
request for admission may move for an order to deem the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests admitted.
(Code Civ. Proc., §¿2033.280, subd. (b).) A party who fails to provide a timely
response waives any objection, including one based on privilege or work
product. (Id., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) “The court shall make this order,
unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been
directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to
the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction… on the
party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion.” (Id., § 2033.280,
subd. (c).)
 
B.      Discussion
 
Here, Plaintiff
served Form Interrogatories, Set Three; Request for Admissions, Set Two; and Requests
for Production of Documents and Electronically Stored Information, Set Two on Defendants
B. Grigorovich D.D.S., Inc. and Boris Grigorovich on March 20,
2024. (Crowell Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. A.) Plaintiff did not receive responses to these
discovery requests by the date they were due. (Ibid.) On April 26, 2024,
Plaintiff’s counsel sent Defendants’ counsel an email regarding its lack of
responses. (Ibid., Exh. B.) Plaintiff has not received responses to its
email inquiry or to its discovery requests as of the date of the filing of
Plaintiff’s instant motions to compel. (Ibid.)  Therefore, because responses have not been
served, Plaintiff’s motions are granted. 
 
Plaintiff requests a total of $1,935.00 in monetary sanctions
for counsel’s work on the instant motions. Plaintiff’s counsel states he spent
a total of 4.5 hours on the six discovery motions at an hourly rate of $350, in
addition to the $60 filing fee for each motion. (Id. ¶ 3.) The Court
finds sanctions are warranted because Defendants have failed to respond. The Court also
finds the requested sanctions are reasonable and grants Plaintiff’s request for
monetary sanctions against Defendants B. Grigorovich D.D.S., Inc. and
Boris Grigorovich and
their attorney of record, jointly and severally, in the total amount of $1,935.00.
