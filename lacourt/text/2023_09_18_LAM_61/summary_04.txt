English Summary:

The tentative ruling is for Case Number BC704116, scheduled for a hearing on September 18, 2023, in Dept 61. The Judge grants Plaintiff Hasmik Yaghobyan's Motion to Strike and Tax Costs in part, taxing $2,018.50 in costs, resulting in a new cost award of $1,690.24.

The Judge's decision is based on the California Rules of Court Rule 3.1700, subd. (b)(1), and Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b). The Judge explains that prevailing parties in civil litigation are entitled to costs expended in the litigation, and any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum.

The Judge also references several legal cases, including Williams v. Chino Valley Independent Fire Dist., Rappenecker v. Sea-Land Service, Inc., and Nelson v. Anderson.

The ruling is in response to Plaintiff Hasmik Yaghobyan's motion to tax the $3,708.74 in costs submitted by Defendants Alan J. Romero and Romero Law, APC on June 5, 2023. The Plaintiff argued that the costs were unsupported by documentation, that this court should tax the filing fees sought in connection with appeals numbered B306809 and B298742, that the costs memorandum includes duplicative charges for duplicative motions to dismiss and respondent’s briefs, and that the unsubstantiated service and compiling fees were incurred in the operative appeal.

The Defendants presented documentation for the fees charged and contended that all such fees were necessary. However, the Judge found that some cost items sought in Defendants’ memorandum were without merit, including a $390 respondent’s fee for appearing in an appeal numbered B298742, a $775 appellant’s fee for another appeal numbered B306809, and $412.20 fees for motions to dismiss in appeals not arising from this case.

Additionally, the Judge found that a reduction of $2,018.50 was appropriate for the $3,708.74 in costs sought, yielding an overall costs award of $1,690.24.

**Case Number:** BC704116

**Hearing Date:** September 18, 2023

**Plaintiff:** Hasmik Yaghobyan

**Defendant:** Alan J. Romero and Romero Law, APC

**Case Citations:** Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b), California Rules of Court Rule 3.1700, subd. (b)(1), Rappenecker v. Sea-Land Service, Inc. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 256, Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111

**Summary:**

In this case, Plaintiff Hasmik Yaghobyan moves to tax the costs submitted by Defendants Alan J. Romero and Romero Law, APC. The court grants the motion in part, reducing the costs by $2,018.50, resulting in a new cost award of $1,690.24.

**Facts:**

* Defendants submitted costs of $3,708.74 on June 5, 2023.
* Plaintiff argues that the costs are unsupported by documentation, and certain costs are unrelated to the operative appeal.
* Defendants present documentation for the fees charged and argue that all fees were necessary.
* Following a court ruling on July 8, 2020, Plaintiffs and Defendants abandoned their appeals.
* Other appeals were filed, but one was dismissed as untimely and duplicative.

**Court's Thinking:**

* The court finds that certain cost items are without merit, such as fees for unsuccessful motions and appeals not arising from this case.
* The court also identifies unsupported service and compiling fees.
* The court reduces the costs by $2,018.50, resulting in a new cost award of $1,690.24.

**Significant Statements:**

* "If the items on a verified cost bill appear proper charges, they are prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses and services therein listed were necessarily incurred." (Rappenecker v. Sea-Land Service, Inc.)
* "Where ‘it cannot be determined from the face of the cost bill whether the items are proper,’ ‘the mere filing of a motion to tax costs may be a ‘proper objection’ to an item.’" (Nelson v. Anderson)
* "A prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding." (Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b))
