And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Xue Zhe Jin's Motion for Protective Order and to Quash Subpoenas, and quashes the subpoenas in their entirety. The Judge finds that the subpoenas are overbroad and seek confidential and privileged information. The Judge also awards sanctions against Plaintiff Brandon Joaquin Rodarte Ayala and his counsel in the amount of $830. The Defendant had argued that the subpoenas were too broad and sought information that was not relevant to the case, and the Judge agrees with this argument. The Judge cites several California case laws to support the decision, including Bank of America, N.A. v. Superior Court (2013) and Rael v. Davis (2008).
