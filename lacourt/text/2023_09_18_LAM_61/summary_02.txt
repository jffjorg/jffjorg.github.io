English Text Summary:

Judge's Tentative Ruling Summary:

In case number 19STCV45161, the Judge granted Defendant Xue Zhe Jin's motion for a protective order.  The subpoenas issued by Plaintiff Brandon Joaquin Rodarte Ayala to Defendant's insurer, Alliance United Insurance Company (AUI), and its employee, Larry Harrison, were quashed (invalidated). The Judge found the subpoenas to be overly broad and seeking information irrelevant to the core issues of the case, including potentially privileged communications between the insurer and insured.  The Judge also awarded sanctions of $830 against the Plaintiff and his attorney, finding that they did not have substantial justification for opposing the motion. The sanctions were less than the $1,330 requested by the Defendant. The underlying dispute appears to involve a collision, with the Plaintiff alleging fraud related to a late affidavit from AUI and questioning whether the Defendant was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident. The Judge found these claims did not justify the breadth of the subpoenas.
