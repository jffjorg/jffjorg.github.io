And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Aecom Energy & Construction, Inc.'s motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The proposed amended complaint seeks to replace Aecom Energy & Construction, Inc. as plaintiff with URS Holdings, Inc. due to corporate transactions that transferred the right to enforce the underlying judgment to URS. The motion also seeks to add allegations of an alter ego relationship between Defendants Topolewski and Northern Resources, as well as further allegations concerning the procedural history in the underlying litigation. The Judge found that Plaintiff has shown good cause for seeking leave to amend, as the transfer of rights to enforce the judgment occurred in January 2020 and the underlying judgment was amended to reflect this substitution in June 2023. The Judge also found that Defendant's arguments regarding prejudice from the addition of alter ego allegations were speculative, given that discovery has already been propounded and trial is not set to begin until April 2024.
