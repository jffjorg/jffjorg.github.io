## English Summary:

The judge is tentatively granting Plaintiff's request to amend their complaint.

The Plaintiff, originally Aecom Energy & Construction, Inc., is now seeking to be replaced by URS Holdings, Inc. This change is due to corporate transactions that transferred the right to enforce the underlying judgment to URS.

The Plaintiff also wants to add allegations about an alter ego relationship between Defendant Topolewski and Northern Resources, as well as further details about the procedural history of the case.

While the Defendant argued that the motion should have been filed sooner, the judge found that the Plaintiff acted reasonably given the circumstances. The judge also found that the Defendant's concerns about prejudice from the added allegations were speculative since much discovery has already occurred and the trial is not scheduled until April 2024. 

Therefore, the judge is granting the motion to amend the complaint.

The judge also finds that the introduction of alter ego allegations would not occasion significant new discovery and would not prejudice the defendant. The motion is therefore granted, allowing plaintiff to file the proposed amended complaint.

**English Text Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

The judge's tentative ruling *grants* the plaintiff, Aecom Energy & Construction, Inc.'s (to be replaced by URS Holdings, Inc.), motion to file a First Amended Complaint. The judge found that although there was some delay, the plaintiff showed good cause for the amendment, because the right to enforce the judgment was transferred to URS Holdings, Inc., and the motion was filed within a reasonable time after the underlying judgement was amended. The defendant, Topolewski, argued that the amendment was untimely and would cause prejudice due to the need for additional discovery related to new alter ego allegations. The judge found the defendant's prejudice arguments to be speculative, since considerable discovery had occurred, and the trial isn't until April 2024. Because California law favors allowing amendments to complaints, and the prejudice was minimal, the motion was granted.

Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled that the Plaintiff, Aecom Energy & Construction, Inc., may file a first amended complaint (FAC) to replace Aecom Energy & Construction, Inc. as plaintiff with URS Holdings, Inc. and add allegations of an alter ego relationship between the Defendants, Topolewski and Northern Resources. The court found that Plaintiff has shown good cause for seeking leave to amend, as the right to enforce the underlying judgment has been transferred to URS in a corporate transaction that took place in January 2020, and the underlying judgment was amended to reflect this substitution in June 2023. The court also found that the introduction of alter ego allegations would occasion minimal prejudice to the Defendant. The court granted the motion, citing California Code of Civil Procedure section 473 and California Rule of Court Rule 3.1324.
