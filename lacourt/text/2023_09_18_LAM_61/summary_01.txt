## English Summary:

The judge is tentatively granting Plaintiff's request to amend their complaint.

The Plaintiff, originally Aecom Energy & Construction, Inc., is now seeking to be replaced by URS Holdings, Inc. This change is due to corporate transactions that transferred the right to enforce the underlying judgment to URS.

The Plaintiff also wants to add allegations about an alter ego relationship between Defendant Topolewski and Northern Resources, as well as further details about the procedural history of the case.

While the Defendant argued that the motion should have been filed sooner, the judge found that the Plaintiff acted reasonably given the circumstances. The judge also found that the Defendant's concerns about prejudice from the added allegations were speculative since much discovery has already occurred and the trial is not scheduled until April 2024. 

Therefore, the judge is granting the motion to amend the complaint.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants plaintiff Aecom Energy & Construction, Inc.'s motion for leave to file a first amended complaint (FAC). The FAC seeks to replace Aecom as plaintiff with URS Holdings, Inc. and to add allegations of an alter ego relationship between defendants Topolewski and Northern Resources. The judge finds that plaintiff has shown good cause for seeking leave to amend, including the transfer of the right to enforce the underlying judgment to URS in January 2020 and the amendment of the underlying judgment in June 2023. The judge also finds that the introduction of alter ego allegations would not occasion significant new discovery and would not prejudice the defendant. The motion is therefore granted, allowing plaintiff to file the proposed amended complaint.
