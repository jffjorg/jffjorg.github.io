**English Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:**

Judge is considering attorney Gerald Ohn's motion to withdraw as counsel for Plaintiffs Stephanie Greene and Nathan Tatsui. Ohn claims he can't get their consent and it's unreasonably difficult to represent them, citing professional conduct rules. Plaintiff Greene objects, stating she thought Ohn would represent her until the end and that Ohn hasn't explained the upcoming motion to tax costs. Judgment has been entered, but there's a motion to tax costs and a potential motion for attorney fees pending. The judge notes these could significantly impact the Plaintiffs financially, but might not require their heavy involvement. Because Ohn's reasons for withdrawing are unclear and Greene wants him to stay, the Judge will hold an in-camera hearing to discuss the basis for Ohn's request to withdraw.
