 Case Number:  BC704116    Hearing Date:   September 18, 2023    Dept:  61 Plaintiff
Hasmik Yaghobyan’s Motion to Strike and Tax Costs is GRANTED in part: $2,018.50
in costs are taxed, and the new cost award is $1,690.24.
 
Defendant
to provide notice.
 
I.       MOTION TO TAX COSTS
“Any notice of motion to
strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the
cost memorandum. If the cost memorandum was served by mail, the period is
extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1013. If the cost memorandum
was served electronically, the period is extended as provided in Code of Civil
Procedure section 1010.6(a)(4).” (California Rules of Court Rule 3.1700, subd.
(b)(1).) 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b) [],
guarantees prevailing parties in civil litigation awards of the costs expended
in the litigation: ‘Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a
prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any
action or proceeding.’” (Williams v. Chino Valley Independent Fire Dist.
(“Williams”) (2015) 61 Cal.4th 97,
100.).
 
“If the items on a verified cost bill appear proper charges,
they are prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses and services therein
listed were necessarily incurred.” (Rappenecker
v. Sea-Land Service, Inc. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 256, 266.) Although
individual cost items are ordinarily challenged by a motion to tax costs, no
cost-item is effectively put in issue by “mere statements” claiming them to be
unreasonable. (Ibid.) However, where
“it cannot be determined from the face of the cost bill whether the items are
proper,” “the mere filing of a motion to tax costs may be a ‘proper objection’
to an item.” (Nelson v. Anderson (1999)
72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131, 132.)
 
Plaintiff Hasmik Yaghobyan (Plaintiff) moves to tax the
$3,708.74 in costs submitted by Defendants Alan J. Romero and Romero Law, APC
(Defendants) on June 5, 2023. Plaintiff argues first that the costs in general
are unsupported by documentation. (Motion at pp. 4–5.) Plaintiff also argues
that this court should tax the filing fees sought in connection with appeals
numbered B306809 and B298742, which were other appeals in other matters.
(Motion at p. 6.) Plaintiff also argues that the costs memorandum includes
duplicative charges for duplicative motions to dismiss and respondent’s briefs,
amounting to $834.90. (Motion at p. 6.) Plaintiff also objects to
unsubstantiated service and compiling fees, for which Plaintiff contends it is
unclear if they were incurred in the operative appeal. (Motion at p. 6.)
Defendant in opposition presents documentation for the fees charged, and
contends that all such fees were necessary. 
 
Some outline of the appeals filed in this case is
appropriate. Following this court’s ruling of July 8, 2020, granting
Defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings in part, as to Osheen
Haghnazarian but not as to Hasmik Yaghobyan, and denying Lala and Leilyan
Hagnazrian’s motion to intervene, all Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on
July 10, 2020. Defendants in turn filed a notice of appeal and cross appeal on
July 15, 2020. But Defendants abandoned their appeal on July 21, 2020, and
Plaintiffs abandoned theirs on July 29, 2020. 
 
The other appeals were filed following this court’s order of
December 2, 2020, granting Defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings.
Plaintiffs filed notice of appeal was filed on April 5, 2021, and another on
April 16, 2021 The first of these appeals was given the case number B312738,
while the second was given the case number B312740. (See 6/18/2021
Notices of Default.) The second appeal was ordered dismissed as untimely and
duplicative of the first appeal on July 26, 2021, per a remittitur dated December
14, 2021. The first appeal was heard and the judgment of this court was affirmed
on March 15, 2023, per a remittitur dated May 30, 2023.
 
From the above procedural history, a number of cost items
sought in Defendants’ memorandum are without merit. Defendants seek a $390
respondent’s fee for appearing in an appeal numbered B298742, for which no
corroboration is offered. They seek a $775 appellant’s fee for another appeal
numbered B306809, again without explanation. Twice they seek $412.20 fees for
motions to dismiss, but the receipts they provide for such motions indicate
they were filed in Case No. B312738, in which the motion was evidently unsuccessful,
and B298742, which was evidently an appeal not arising from this case, and for
which no support or argument is provided. 
 
The following additional charges are also ill-supported:
 
·        
A $10.50 proof of service dated August 5, 2020,
in an appeal numbered B306809;
·        
A joint appendix charge of $7.50 dated July 31,
2020, in Appeal No. B306809;
·        
An appendix charge of $10.50 dated July 25,
2020, in Appeal No. B306620;
 
Thus a reduction of $2,018.50 is appropriate for the
$3,708.74 in costs sought, yielding an overall costs award of $1,690.24.
 
The motion to tax costs is therefore GRANTED in part;
$2,018.50 in costs are taxed, and the new cost award is $1,690.24.
