BACKGROUND
 
On December 22, 2021, Arbitrator Daniel Smith (the
“Arbitrator”) issued an arbitration award (the “Award”) in the amount of $8,999.22
for Petitioner WD Contractor Services Co. (“Petitioner”) and against Respondent
Silvia Moreno (“Respondent”). 
 
On August 23, 2023, Petitioner
filed the instant Petition to Confirm Contractual Arbitration Award. Respondent
filed a response requesting the Court correct the award on December 01, 2023. On
December 27, 2023, the Court on its own motion continued the hearing on the
Petition, ordering Petitioner to file and serve supplemental papers addressing
deficiencies with service of the Award by the Arbitrator. 
 
On January 17, 2024, Petitioner
filed supplemental briefing for the Petition. Respondent filed exhibits in
opposition. No reply has been filed. 
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Petitioner requests
the Court to confirm the award totaling $8,999.22. Petitioner additionally seeks
an award of interest at the statutory rate and cost of the suit. 
OPPOSITION
 
            In
opposition, Respondent alleges that the award should be corrected because she
has already paid out a total of $9,108.17. As a result, Petitioner owes
Respondent $108.95. Respondent further alleges that Petitioner and the
Contractors State Board have rendered improper service as both have rendered
service to an address from which Respondent no longer receives mail.
 
REPLY
 
            No reply
has been filed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard 
“Any
party to an arbitration award in which an award has been made may petition the
court to confirm, correct, or vacate the award.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1285.) “Regardless of the particular relief
granted, any arbitrator’s award is enforceable only when confirmed as a
judgment of the superior court.” (O’Hare v. Municipal Resource Consultants (2003)
107 Cal.App.4th 267, 278.) “Once a petition to
confirm an award is filed, the superior
court must select one of only four courses of action: it may confirm the award,
correct and confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss the petition.” (EHM Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of
Hollywood, Inc. (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.) “It is well
settled that the scope of judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely
narrow.” (California Faculty Assn.
v. Superior Court (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 935, 943.) “Neither the trial court, nor the appellate court, may
‘review the merits of the dispute, the sufficiency of the evidence, or the
arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we correct or review an award because of an
arbitrator’s legal or factual error, even if it appears on the award’s face.”
(EHM Productions, supra, at p.
1063-64.) 
 
II.        Discussion 
 
A.        Filing Requirements (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.4)
 
Code of Civil Procedure, section
1285.4 states: “A petition under
this chapter shall: 
 
(a) Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of
the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of the
agreement.
 
(b) Set forth the names of the arbitrators. 
 
(c) Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and
the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.” 
 
(Code Civ.
Proc. § 1285.4.) “A response to a petition under this chapter may request the
court to dismiss the petition or to confirm, correct or vacate the award.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1285.2.)
 
Here, Petitioner has satisfied the
requirements of CCP section 1285.4 by setting forth the substance of the
parties’ agreement to arbitrate within the Petition. (Pet. ¶ 4, Attachment 4(b).)

Petitioner sets forth the Arbitrator’s
name, Daniel Smith., and attaches a copy of the Arbitrator’s award of $8,999.22
in Plaintiff’s favor along with a
letter indicating the award is duly executed. (See Attachment 8(c).) The
Award stipulates that the Petitioner is to be awarded the amount totaling
$8,999.22 representing the difference
between the amounts of $7,625.00 for water damage repairs performed by
Petitioner that did not meet accepted trade standards, and $16,624.22 in
outstanding balance owed per the insurance approved scope and cost of the
repairs. (Id.) Thus, the Court finds that Petitioner follows CCP section
1285.4.
B.        Service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing (Code Civ.
Proc. § 1290.4)
Code of
Civil Procedure, section 1290.4 states, in relevant part: 
 
“(a) A copy of the petition and a
written notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof and any other
papers upon which the petition is based
shall be served in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for the
service of such petition and notice.
 
(b) If the arbitration agreement does not
provide the manner in which such service shall be made and the person upon whom
service is to be made has not previously appeared in the proceeding and has not
previously been served in accordance with this subdivision:
 
(1) Service within this State shall be made in the
manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action. 
 
(2) Service outside this State shall be made by mailing
the copy of the petition and notice of hearing and other papers by registered
or certified mail. Personal service is the equivalent of such service by mail.
Proof of service by mail shall be made by affidavit showing such mailing
together with the return receipt of the United States Post Office bearing the
signature of the person on whom service was made…” 
 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
1290.4(a)&(b).)
 
Here, the Petition and notice
of hearing was served by substituted service on Respondent on September 03,
2023. (See. 09/11/23 Proof of Service by Substituted Service.) Thus, the Court finds that Petitioner has
satisfied CCP section 1290.4.
C.        Service
of the Arbitration Award & Timeliness of Petition (Code Civ. Proc. §§
1283.6, 1288, 1288.4)
Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6
provides that, “The neutral arbitrator
shall serve a signed copy of
the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by registered or
certified mail or as provided in the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1283.6.)  California Rules of Court rule
3.825(b)(1) provides that the arbitrator must file the award with the clerk,
with proof of service on each party to the arbitration. (CA ST CIVIL RULES Rule
3.825(b)(1)) The Superior Court of Los Angeles County, Local Rules, rule
3.301(a) so provides that consistent with CRC 3.825 arbitrator can satisfy this
by filing Form LAADR-014 with the award, and proof of service. (Super. Ct. L.A.
County, Local Rules, rule 3.301(a).) Additionally, a party may seek a court
judgment confirming an arbitration award by filing and serving a petition no
more than four years, but not less than
10 days, after the award is served on the
petitioner. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.)
In its prior
order, the Court noted that the Petition lacked proof of service indicating
that the Arbitrator served a signed copy of the award on each party, and thus
did not satisfy CCP § 1283.6. (12/27/23 Minute Order.)
The Court
notes that since then Petitioner has subsequently filed a proof of service
indicating that the Case Facilitator, Stephanie Felton, served the Award on
both parties by certified mail on December 12, 2021. (01/17/24 Notice RE: Pet.
to Confirm Contractual Arbitration Award; Exh. B.) This sufficiently satisfies
CCP § 1283.6 as the Arbitrator has properly served a copy of the award. Noting
that the award was served on December 12, 2021, the Court finds that the
Petition would be considered timely as it was filed more than 10 days after
Petitioner was served with the award. 
Therefore, the
Court finds that the Petition satisfies CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4. 
D.
Challenge to the Award. 
Code of Civil Procedure § 1285.2 provides that a response to
a petition to confirm an arbitration award may request the court to dismiss the
petition or to confirm, correct or vacate the award. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.2.)  The Code further provides in § 1285.8
that a response requesting such relief “shall set forth the grounds on which
the request for such relief is based. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.8.)  Moreover,
the court may not either vacate or correct the award unless the petition or
response was: 
(a)   …
duly served and filed; or 
(b)   …
duly served and filed and; 
(1)  
All petitioners and respondents are before the court;
or 
(2)  
All petitioners and respondents have been given
reasonable notice that the court will be requested at the hearing to vacate the
award or that the court on its own motion has determined to vacate the award
and all petitioners and respondents have been given an opportunity to show why
the award should not be vacated.
(Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 1286.4, 1286.8.)  
The Court notes that in opposition to the Petition,
Respondent argues that Petitioner was paid in full for his work, leaving an
overpayment of $108.95. (Opp. p. 1.) Moreover, Respondent again asserts that
she was never properly served with the arbitration award. (Id.) 
The Court again notes the same deficiencies with Respondent’s
opposition as it did in its 12/27/23 order. In so far as the response requests
the Court to correct the award, Respondent does not supply the Court with proper
grounds for correction under CCP § 1285.8. Here, Respondent alleges that the
award amount is wrong. However, the Court notes that Respondent does not supply
the Court with any admissible evidence such as authenticated documents,
authenticated by a sworn declaration, or otherwise, that supports Respondent’s
contention. The Court acknowledged that Respondent provides the Court with a
copy of communications between Respondent and the AMCC Case Manager, and
Respondent’s insurance company, and the U.S. Post office.  However, as mentioned before, none of these
documents are authenticated and would be considered inadmissible. 
Moreover, Respondent again appears to misunderstand the
purpose of a Petition to Confirm an Arbitration Award. “[I]t is the general
rule that, with narrow exceptions, an arbitrator's decision cannot be reviewed
for errors of fact or law.” (EHM Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of
Hollywood, Inc. (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.) “Neither the trial court, nor the appellate court, may
‘review the merits of the dispute, the sufficiency of the evidence, or the
arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we correct or review an award because of an
arbitrator’s legal or factual error, even if it appears on the award’s face.” (EHM Productions,
supra, at p. 1063-64.) Asking the Court to acknowledge the overpayment
claim, essentially asks the Court to review the merits of the dispute and in
turn review the award because of the Arbitrator’s factual error. This
would not be proper grounds to challenge the award under CCP §§ 1285.2 and
1285.8, nor would review under this basis be proper as guided by case law. Thus,
Respondent’s response is improper under CCP §§ 1285.2 and 1285.8. 
Accordingly, because the Petition satisfies the requirements
set forth above, the Court GRANTS the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award. 
II.        Conclusion 
            
Petitioner Contractor Services Co.’s
Petition to Confirm Contractual Arbitration Award is GRANTED.
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
