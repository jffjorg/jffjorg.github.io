The court does not require Defendant Full of Flavor, LLC to provide further responses to Form Interrogatories 102.10, 109.1, 112.4, and 112.5 and Special Interrogatories No. 2 and 3.

The court denies Defendant Full of Flavor, LLC's request for sanctions and Plaintiff's request for sanctions. The court finds that Plaintiff's responses to interrogatories are sufficient and that Defendant Full of Flavor, LLC has not successfully opposed the motion.
