And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed by the plaintiff, Maria Delo Consuelos Bustos Rodriguez, against Ross Stores, Inc. The first motion seeks to compel the depositions of two non-party witnesses, Vicente Cardenas and Alexandra Lopez, who were present at the time of the incident in which the plaintiff was injured. The second motion seeks to compel the defendant to respond to written discovery requests.

The judge has denied both motions. In the first motion, the judge found that the defendant had failed to show cause for not producing the witnesses and that the plaintiff had not shown good cause for the deposition. The judge also noted that the plaintiff could have served the witnesses with a subpoena instead of relying on the court to compel their appearance.

In the second motion, the judge found that the defendant had failed to respond to the written discovery requests in a timely manner and that the plaintiff had been prejudiced by the delay. The judge ordered the defendant to serve verified and complete responses without objection to the written discovery requests.

The judge also imposed sanctions on the defendant, ordering them to pay the plaintiff $4,550 for the costs incurred in preparing and filing the motions. The judge reduced the hourly rate of the plaintiff's counsel from $450 per hour to $350 per hour and permitted them to charge for four hours of preparation time and one hour of appearance time for each motion.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motions to compel depositions and written discovery and imposes sanctions on the defendant for their failure to comply with discovery requests.
