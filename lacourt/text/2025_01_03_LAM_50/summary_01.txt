The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Carlos Lopez vs. The Wolf Logistics, LLC et al. The plaintiff has moved to strike the defendant's answer and enter default, citing California law that prohibits a corporation from representing itself in court. The defendant had substituted out its attorney of record and is now representing itself. The judge has ordered the defendant to obtain counsel and file a substitution of attorney by a certain date. The matter has been continued to a future hearing date, and if the defendant fails to obtain counsel, the judge will grant the plaintiff's motion and strike the defendant's answer and enter default.
