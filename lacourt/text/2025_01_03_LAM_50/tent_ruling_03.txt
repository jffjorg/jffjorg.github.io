[1]As set forth
above, Quantum’s Cross-Complaint alleges that “Plaintiff, Mital Tamoro…brought
the underlying action against Quantum alleging various labor code violations
premised on her allegation that she was terminated while in a protected
employment status following her pregnancy.” (Cross-Compl., ¶ 1.)


[2]“A cause of action for damages for
breach of contract is comprised of the following elements: (1) the contract,
(2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s
breach, and (4) the resulting damages to plaintiff.” (Careau & Co. v.
Security Pacific Business Credit, Inc. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1371, 1388.) 


[3]In the sixth cause
of action for declaratory judgment, Quantum alleges, inter alia, that
“[a]n actual, existing, and justiciable controversy exists between Quantum and
Larkin concerning their respective rights and duties under the Larkin
Agreement. Quantum contends that Larkin is required to defend the Tamoro
Complaint and to indemnify Quantum for any liability arising out of the Tamoro
Complaint. Larkin contends that it is not required to defend the Tamoro
Complaint or to indemnify Quantum…The issuance of declaratory relief by this
Court is necessary to resolve the existing controversy.” (Cross-Compl., ¶¶
74-75.)
