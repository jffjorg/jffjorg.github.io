                        Defendants.


Case No.:


22STCV15444




Hearing Date:


January 3, 2025




Hearing
  Time:   10:00 a.m. 
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
MOTION TO STRIKE
  ANSWER AND ENTER DEFAULT OF THE WOLF LOGISTICS



 
Background
On May 10, 2022, Plaintiff Carlos Lopez, individually, and
on behalf of all aggrieved employees (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants The Wolf Logistics, LLC (“Wolf Logistics”) and Black Panther
Logistics, LLC. Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended Complaint on
February 9, 2024, alleging fourteen causes of action. 
On
September 12, 2022, Wolf Logistics filed an answer to Plaintiff’s First Amended
Complaint.
Plaintiff
now moves for an order striking the answer and entering the default of Wolf
Logistics. The motion is unopposed.  
Discussion
A court
may strike any “irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading”
or all or any part of a pleading “not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.) “The grounds for a motion
to strike shall appear on the face of the challenged pleading or from any
matter of which the court is required to take judicial notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437.) 
Plaintiff
moves for an order striking
the answer and entering the default of Wolf Logistics “on the ground that a
corporation or LLC cannot appear on its behalf, as [Wolf Logistics] has sought
to do by substituting out its attorney of record on October 4, 2024.” (Mot. at
p. 2:3-4.) On October 4, 2024, Wolf Logistics filed a Substitution of Attorney
indicating that Dana Douglas, Esq. is Wolf Logistics’ former legal
representative, and that Wolf Logistics is now representing itself. Plaintiff’s
counsel states that he “met and conferred about the issue of the Wolf
representing itself with the principal of the Wolf, Ali Alwaely on October 22,
2024. The meet and confer was telephonic. However, Mr. Alwaely could not state
when he could obtain an attorney, contending that he was using an ‘app’ to
attempt to locate one.” (Harris Decl., ¶ 3.) 
“As a
general rule, it is well established in California that a corporation cannot
represent itself in a court of record either in propria persona or through an
officer or agent who is not an attorney.” (Caressa Camille, Inc. v. Alcoholic Beverage
Controls Appeals Bd. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1101.) Plaintiff cites to CLD Construction, Inc. v. City
of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1148, footnote 2, where the Court of Appeal cited to United States v. High Country Broad. Co. (9th Cir. 1993) 3 F.3d 1244, for its holding that it
was “‘perfectly appropriate’ to enter default
judgment against corporation when corporation’s president/sole shareholder does
not follow court order to obtain counsel.” The Court notes that Plaintiff has
not previously requested such an order from the Court and the Court has not sua
sponte issued an order for Wolf Logistics to obtain counsel. The Court construes
the instant motion as including such a request and hereby orders Wolf Logistics to obtain counsel, to file a
substitution of attorney on or before ____________, 2025, and to deliver a
courtesy copy thereof to Dept. 50 concurrently with the filing. 
This matter is continued to ____________, 2025, at 10 a.m.
in Dept. 50. If no substitution of attorney is filed prior thereto, the Court
will grant the instant motion, strike Wolf Logistics’ answer, and enter default as to Wolf Logistics. 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the Court continues Plaintiff’s
motion to strike answer and enter default of Wolf Logistics to ____________, 2025, at 10 a.m. in Dept.
50.
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
