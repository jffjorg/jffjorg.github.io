And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the application of Eduardo Roa to appear as counsel pro hac vice on behalf of the defendants, VBX Labs, LLC and Kevin Doud. The application states that Roa is not a resident of California and is not engaged in substantial business in the state. Roa has submitted the required declarations and proof of service, which demonstrates that he is a licensee in good standing in other courts and has not been suspended or disbarred in any court. Based on this information, the court finds that Roa has satisfied all the requirements to appear pro hac vice in this matter, and the motion is therefore granted.
