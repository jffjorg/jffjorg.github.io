The applicant declares under penalty of perjury that he is

(Decl. of Eduardo Roa, ¶ 7;
Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 9.40(a).)
 
Pursuant to
rule 9.40(d) of the California Rules of Court, the application states:
(1)  The applicant’s
residence and office address; (Roa Decl. ¶ 2.)
(2)  The courts to
which the applicant has been admitted to practice and the dates of admission; (Id.

(3)  That the
applicant is a licensee in good standing in those courts; (Id. at ¶ 5.)
(4)  That the
applicant is not currently suspended or disbarred in any court; (Ibid.)
(5)  The title of
each court and cause in which the applicant has filed an application to appear
as counsel pro hac vice in this state in the preceding two years, the date of
each application, and whether or not it was granted; (Id. at ¶ 8.) and
(6)  The name,
address, and telephone number of the active licensee of the State Bar of
California who is attorney of record. (Id. at ¶ 6.)
 
The proof
of service attached to the application states that on 1/3/25, Defendants
electronically served the application on all other parties who have appeared in
the matter. Defendants’ counsel also declares that the application will be served
