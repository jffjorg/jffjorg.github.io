Here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to advance the trial date from January 27, 2025 to July 15, 2024. The plaintiff, Hoang Nguyen, argued that there is good cause to advance the trial date because the statutory time for bringing the case to trial will have expired by January 27, 2025, and the case will be dismissed. However, the Judge found that Nguyen has miscalculated the deadline for bringing the case to trial. The case was stayed pending appeal from April 11, 2022 to January 22, 2024, and the time for bringing the case to trial was tolled under Emergency Rule 10(a). The Judge calculated the deadline for bringing the case to trial to be June 1, 2025, which is more than four months after the current trial date of January 27, 2025. Therefore, the Judge ruled that there is no good cause to advance the trial date.
