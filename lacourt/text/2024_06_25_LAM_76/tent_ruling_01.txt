  Case Number:  22STCV27794    Hearing Date:   June 25, 2024    Dept:  76             Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants negligently performed an incision and drainage
procedure of an abdominal wall abscess with placement of a wound VAC
(vacuum-assisted closure) dressing. Unbeknownst to Plaintiff, a surgical sponge
used during the surgery was left inside Plaintiff's abdominal cavity.          
Defendant
James A. Murray, M.D. moves for summary judgment.
TENTATIVE RULING
The hearing on Defendant James A. Murray,
M.D.’s motion for summary judgment is placed OFF-CALENDAR AS MOOT. 
            On May 22, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed
moving party with prejudice. Because this was before the opposition to the
motion for summary judgment was due, the Court has no jurisdiction to rule on
the merits of the motion. (Zapanta v. Universal Care, Inc. (2003)
107 Cal.App.4th 1167, 1170-74.)
