[1] The Court
also notes that the merits arguments raised with regard to each claim, such as defects
in the pleading of the quiet title claim, the lack of a private right of action
under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1738A, insufficient pleading of a basis for a conspiracy
claim, and so forth, (Mem. Pts & Auths at 6-10), may be the grounds for a demurrer
or motion to strike, but do not speak to the first prong anti-SLAPP analysis as
to moving Defendant Tristina Cole.
