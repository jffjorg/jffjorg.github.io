And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion for summary judgment brought by defendant James A. Murray, M.D. is moot because the plaintiff has already dismissed the moving party with prejudice, before the opposition to the motion was due. As a result, the court lacks jurisdiction to rule on the merits of the motion. The judge cites the case of Zapanta v. Universal Care, Inc. (2003) in support of this ruling.
