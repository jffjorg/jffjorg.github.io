And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Defendant Tristina Cole's anti-SLAPP special motion to strike the First Amended Complaint. The complaint alleges that Defendant made misrepresentations in custody hearings to facilitate the kidnapping of the Plaintiff's son. The judge found that Defendant did not demonstrate that each of the seven causes of action arise from an act in furtherance of this moving Defendant's right of petition or free speech, and therefore did not meet the burden on the first prong of the anti-SLAPP statute. As a result, the judge did not move on to the second prong of the anti-SLAPP statute, which requires the plaintiff to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the claim. Defendant is ordered to answer the First Amended Complaint within 10 days.
