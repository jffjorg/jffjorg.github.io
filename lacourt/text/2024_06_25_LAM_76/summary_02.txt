And here is a summary in English text:

The judge rules that the Defendant Automobile Club of Southern California's motion to compel arbitration is granted. The arbitration will proceed before JAMS as to the claims against the Defendant only. The case is stayed pending arbitration, although co-Defendants Reed Group LLC and Cannon Cochran Management Services, Inc. may bring their own motions to compel arbitration within 30 days of this order.

The judge finds that the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable, and that the parties agreed to submit all claims to mandatory arbitration. The agreement meets the minimum requirements set forth in the Armendariz case, including providing for neutral arbitrators, adequate discovery, written awards, and payment of arbitration costs by the Defendant. The judge rejects the Plaintiff's argument that the agreement is illusory because of the Defendant's veto power as to arbitrating at AAA.
