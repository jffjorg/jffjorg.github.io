And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motion for summary judgment filed by State Farm and the opposition filed by Podojil and Yaghch. Although the opposition was filed late, the judge has chosen to consider it on its merits. State Farm argues that it has waived its cost of proof motion by not filing a request to compel further discovery responses. However, the judge finds that this argument is waived because it is conclusively presented without analysis or pinpoint citation. The judge also notes that Podojil and Yaghch could not have had information connecting the mirror to HomeGoods, as they did not have any information to that effect. Defendant's declarant, Kangas, has searched HomeGoods inventories and found no connection between the mirror and HomeGoods. Based on this evidence, the judge finds it more probable than not that HomeGoods did not sell the subject mirror. Therefore, the judge is inclined to grant State Farm's motion for summary judgment.
