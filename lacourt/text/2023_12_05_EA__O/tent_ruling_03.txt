 Case Number:  23PSCV00729    Hearing Date:   December 5, 2023    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
 Motion to Reclassify (Walker Motion)
is GRANTED.
 
Background
 
This case
arises from the dog bite of a minor. 
 
On March 13,
2023, Plaintiff Lidia Gonzalez as Guardian Ad Litem for Ronny Gonzalez filed
suit against Defendants Manuel Castro, Maria Rosario Castro, Lucia Melo for (1)
general negligence and (2) premises liability.
 
On August 29,
2023, default was entered against Lucia Melo and Maria Rosario Castro. 
 
On September
13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a POS as to Estate of Manuel Castro, sued herein as
DOE 1.[1]
 
On September
14, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a notice of lis pendens.
 
On October
19, 2023, the court issued the following minute order during the CMC hearing:
“The Court informs the Defendant, Maria Rosario Castro, that she is currently
in Default Status. On the Court’s own motion pursuant to CCP §403.040(a), the
matter is set for a Walker Hearing as to whether the matter should be
reclassified as a limited jurisdiction case under Walker v. Superior Court
(1991) 53 Cal.3d 257. The parties are ordered to file briefs nine (9) calendar
days before the scheduled hearing. If a party so desires, it may file a reply
brief five (5) calendar days before the scheduled hearing.”
 
On November
15, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their brief. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
According to CCP section 403.040, a court, “on its own motion, may
reclassify a case at any time.”  The court must give notice and allow the
parties an opportunity to contest the reclassification. (Stern v. Superior
Court (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 223, 229-231.) 
 
As for the requirements of reclassification from an unlimited to a
limited case, trial court must find that the matter will necessarily result in
a verdict below the jurisdictional amount required by statute for
classification as an unlimited civil case. (Hiona v. Superior Court (2020)
48 Cal.App.5th 866, 872.)  “Necessarily”
means that there is “a high level of certainty that a damage award will not
exceed $25,000.” (Walker v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257,
268-270.) Finding that a judgment that exceeds $25,000 is merely “unlikely” or
“not reasonably probable” is not sufficient to support reclassification of the
case as a limited civil case. (Hiona, supra, 48 Cal.App.5th at p. 872.)
In sum, in making the determination to reclassify, legal certainty is required.
(Chahal v. Superior Court (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 399, 402-403.)
 
Discussion
 
Based on the
brief, if the minor receives surgery for the hypertrophic scar, it will cost
about $8,800.00 beyond the $2802 already expended. $11,602 is less than $25,000.01. Plaintiffs have not sought
other damages nor provided an explanation for other damages. 
 
Thus, by
Plaintiffs’ own explanation, it is certain that the damages in this case will
not exceed $25,000. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, the court reclassifies the case to limited.
