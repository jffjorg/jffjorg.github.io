And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant's motion for costs of proof in the amount of $105,054.15. The motion was filed by Defendant HomeGoods, Inc. in response to Plaintiff's failure to admit to certain requests for admission (RFAs) related to the manufacture and sale of a mirror that allegedly caused an explosion. The court found that Plaintiff did not have sufficient information to admit to the RFAs and that Defendant did not have a reasonably entertained good faith belief that it would prevail on the issues at trial. The court also rejected Defendant's argument that Plaintiff's case was based on speculation and found that both parties did not have sufficient evidence to determine liability at the outset of the case. As a result, the court denied Defendant's motion for costs of proof.
