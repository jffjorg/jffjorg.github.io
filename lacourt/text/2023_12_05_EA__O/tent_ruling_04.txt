[1] An estate cannot be
sued. (See Lazar v. Lazar's Estate (1962) 208 Cal.App.2d 554 [“An ‘estate’ is not a legal
entity and is neither a natural nor artificial person. It is merely a name to
indicate the sum total of the assets and liabilities of a decedent, or of an
incompetent, or of a bankrupt. [Citations.] An ‘estate’ can neither sue
nor be sued.”].)
