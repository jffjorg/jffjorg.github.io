And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion to reclassify the case from unlimited to limited jurisdiction. The case arises from a dog bite injury to a minor, and the plaintiff has claimed damages of $11,602.00, which is less than the jurisdictional amount of $25,000.01. The court has reviewed the briefs filed by the parties and has determined that it is certain that the damages will not exceed $25,000. Therefore, the court has reclassified the case as a limited jurisdiction case.
