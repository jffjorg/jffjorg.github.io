Summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer of Defendant POSITIVE BEHAVIORAL STEPS CORPORATION (PBS) to Plaintiff JORGE LOYOLA's First Amended Complaint (FAC) with leave to amend. The Judge finds that the FAC fails to provide fair notice to the defendants and lacks sufficient facts to support each cause of action. The Judge also grants the motion to strike the portion of the FAC requesting prejudgment interest with leave to amend. The Judge notes that the FAC is largely boilerplate and lacks essential facts, making it unclear as to which defendant did what and how each defendant allegedly breached its duties. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to amend the FAC to cure these defects and provide fair notice to the defendants.
