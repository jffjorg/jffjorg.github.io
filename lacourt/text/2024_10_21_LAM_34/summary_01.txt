And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied Defendant's third motion to set aside default. The motion is based on an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. However, the court finds that the motion fails to satisfy the requirements of section 1008, which governs renewed applications under section 473(b) for relief from default based on an attorney's sworn affidavit. The court also finds that the declaration is silent concerning counsel's attempt at filing an answer and raises more questions than answers. The court recognizes that even under the mandatory provisions of section 473(b), the court's role is not to rubber stamp a result given the filing of a bare bone attorney declaration.
