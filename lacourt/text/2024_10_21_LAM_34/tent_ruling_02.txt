[1]              The September 18, 2024 minute order
appears to contain a clerical error, inasmuch as the order in question was
rendered on June 18, 2024.


[2]              The court declines to consider
Defendant’s counsel’s July 29, 2024, September 9, 2024 and October 15, 2024 declarations,
all of which were filed subsequent to Defendant’s reply brief on July 24, 2024.



[3]              Code of Civil Procedure § 415.20,
subdivision (b) states as follows: “If a copy of the summons and complaint
cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered to the person to be
served, as specified in Section 416.60, 416.70, 416.80, or 416.90, a summons
may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the person’s
dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address
other than a United States Postal Service post office box, in the presence of a
competent member of the household or a person apparently in charge of his or
her office, place of business, or usual mailing address other than a United
States Postal Service post office box, at least 18 years of age, who shall be
informed of the contents thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy of the
summons and of the complaint by first-class mail, postage prepaid to the person
to be served at the place where a copy of the summons and complaint were left.
Service of a summons in this manner is deemed complete on the 10th day after
the mailing.” 


[4]              Section § 1008, subdivision (b)
provides that “[a] party who originally made an application for an order which was
refused in whole or part, or granted conditionally or on terms, may make a
subsequent application for the same order upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law, in which case it shall be shown by affidavit what
application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions
were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed
to be shown. . .”


[5]              As an aside, the court rejects
Plaintiff’s contention that the instant motion was not timely filed under
Section 1008, inasmuch as subdivision (b) does not contain a time limitation.


[6]              If Defendant is seeking
discretionary relief under Section § 473(b) in this instant motion, Defendant’s
failure to comply with Section § 1008 requirements is fatal. (Defendant’s
initial motion was necessarily predicated on discretionary grounds, inasmuch as
it was not accompanied by an attorney affidavit of fault). As well, the court
notes that the motion would be untimely, as it has been filed in excess of 6
months from the August 17, 2023 entry of default.


[7]              In Standard Microsystems Corp.
v. Winbond Electronics Corp. (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 868
(disapproved of by Even Zohar, supra, 179 Cal.App.4th 868 with respect
to its discussion finding a conflict between Sections 473(b) and 1008), the
court held that Section 1008 did not apply to the defendant’s application for mandatory
relief under section 473(b) because the application did not seek
reconsideration or renewal of the defendant’s earlier, failed application for discretionary
relief. Thus, if Defendant were able to show that she is entitled to relief in
this instant motion pursuant to an attorney affidavit of fault, Section 1008
would not apply inasmuch as her initial motion was made pursuant to the
discretionary relief part of Section 473(b).
