  Case Number:  23PSCV01975    Hearing Date:   October 21, 2024    Dept:  34 Defendant’s Third
Motion to Vacate or Set Aside the Entry of Default is DENIED.
 
Background   
 
Plaintiff
Billy Jaite (“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows: 
 
Plaintiff
and Vanessa Campa (“Defendant”) were in a relationship from approximately May
2017-April 2022. Defendant has been unemployed since November 2018. During
Plaintiff’s and Defendant’s relationship, Plaintiff grew close to Defendant’s
daughter, Victoria Isabela Fernandez (“Victoria”). Plaintiff paid Defendant’s
rent from approximately October 2017 to November 2022, in large part to ensure
Victoria would not be homeless. Throughout the years Plaintiff and Defendant
had numerous discussions about establishing a trust for Victoria’s exclusive
benefit. After Plaintiff and Defendant ended their relationship, Plaintiff made
four transfers to Defendant in November and December 2022 totaling $350,000.00,
with the mutual understanding and oral agreement that these transfers would be
put into the trust established for Victoria. Defendant has ceased all
communication with Plaintiff. Defendant is living off the monies and has failed
to establish the trust.
 
On June 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
complaint, asserting causes of action against Defendant for:
 
1.              
Specific Performance of Contract; and,
2.              
Breach of Contract.
 
On August 17, 2023, Defendant’s
default was entered.
 
An Order to Show Cause Re: Entry of
Default Judgment is set for October 21, 2024.
 
Legal Standard 
 
“When an
application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused
in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any
party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of
written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made
the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order. The party making the application shall state by affidavit what
application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions
were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed
to be shown.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1008, subd. (a).)
 
“A party who
originally made an application for an order which was refused in whole or part,
or granted conditionally or on terms, may make a subsequent application for the
same order upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, in which case it
shall be shown by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what
judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts,
circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown. For a failure to comply with
this subdivision, any order made on a subsequent application may be revoked or
set aside on ex parte motion.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (b).)
 
The legislative intent was to restrict motions for reconsideration to
circumstances where a party offers the court some fact or circumstance not
previously considered, and some valid reason for not offering it earlier. (Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32
Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500; Mink
v. Sup. Ct. (Arnel Develop. Co., Inc.) (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342; Baldwin v. Home Sav. of America (1997)
59 Cal.App.4th 1192, 1198.) “The burden under section 1008 is comparable to
that of a party seeking a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence:
the information must be such that the moving party could not, with reasonable
diligence, have discovered or produced it at the trial.” (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th
206, 212-213.)
 
Jurisdiction
 
At the outset, the court notes that
the instant matter was assigned, effective August 8, 2024, to Judge Allison L.
Westfahl Kong (“Judge Westfahl Kong”) in Department H at the East District,
Pomona Courthouse South. On September 18, 2024, Judge Westfahl Kong continued
the hearing on the instant motion to October 21, 2024 in this instant
department and advised the parties “that this motion will be heard by Judge
Hernandez as it appears to be a Motion for Reconsideration of his order from
6/16/2024.” [1]
 
The court agrees
that the instant motion, while styled as a motion to set aside default pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), is, in actuality, a motion for
reconsideration of its June 18, 2024 order denying Defendant’s “Motion to Set
Aside Default,” as set forth below. (See Powell v. County of Orange
(2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 1573, 1577 [“The name of a motion is not controlling,
and, regardless of the name, a motion asking the trial court to decide the same
matter previously ruled on is a motion for reconsideration under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1008”]. A motion for reconsideration under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a) must be brought before the same judge
who made the order. (Cal. Civ. Proc. § 1008(a).) Subdivision (b) does not require that the same judge hear
a renewal motion (see Deauville Restaurant, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 843, 849-851) but does not preclude this.
 
The court will proceed to entertain
the merits of the motion on this basis. 
 
Request for Judicial Notice 
 
The court denies Defendant’s
Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”) included in paragraph 6 of Defendant’s
declaration in support of this motion filed on June 28, 2024. (Gbur v. Cohen
(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 296, 301 (“[J]udicial notice . . . is always confined to
those matters which are relevant to the issue at hand.”].)
 
The court grants Plaintiff’s RJN. “A court may properly take judicial
notice of its own records. (Evid. Code, § 452, subd. (e).)” (Garcia v.
Sterling (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 17, 21.)
 
Discussion[2]
 
Defendant moves the court, pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b), for an order setting aside her
default pursuant to an attorney affidavit of fault. 
 
As the parties will undoubtedly
recollect, this is Defendant’s third motion to set aside default. 
 
On February 16, 2024, Defendant
filed a “Motion to Set Aside Default,” on the basis that she was “not validly
served with process of the Summons and did not receive actual notice she was a
named party in this matter in time to defend against the action. See Code of
Civil Procedure sections 415.20(b) and 473(b)." (Plaintiff’s RJN, Exh. 6).

 
On April 4, 2024, the court denied
the above motion; in doing so, the court stated, in relevant part, as follows:
 
Defendant cites to Code of Civil
Procedure § 473, subdivision (b) as the basis 
of her motion (See Motion, 1:28-2:1
and 3:20-4:12); however, it appears from 
the foregoing
language that Defendant is arguing improper service, which is a subdivision (d)
argument (i.e., “[t]he court may, upon motion of the injured party, 
or its own
motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or orders as entered, 
so as to conform
to the judgment or order directed, and may, on motion of either 
party after
notice to the other party, set aside any void judgment or order”) or 
possibly a lack
of actual notice, which is a Code of Civil Procedure § 473.5 
argument
generally used in instances where service was made via publication. 
Defendant also
references surprise and extrinsic fraud in on page 4 of the motion. 
 
Defendant’s motion, however, is not
accompanied by any declaration whatsoever, 
either disavowing valid service or
setting forth facts supporting her argument 
based on actual notice, surprise and
extrinsic fraud. At any rate, the proof of 
service filed July 12, 2023
reflects that substituted service pursuant to Code of 
Civil Procedure § 415.20, subd. (b)[3] was
effectuated on July 7, 2023 via 
Co-Occupant Paloma Gonzales
(‘Gonzales’) at 990 N. Park Ave., #205 (‘Park 
Avenue Address’) in Pomona by
registered process server ‘E. Ratliff.’ (RJN, 
Exh. 3). 
 
Plaintiff attests that he was
involved in a romantic relationship with 
Defendant from around May 2017
until April 2022, that Gonzales is Defendant’s 
sister, that Defendant’s residence
and only address is the Park Avenue Address 
and that he is
not aware of any other mailing or residential address for Defendant.
(Plaintiff’s Decl., ¶¶ 2-4). A ‘Declaration of Diligence’ attached to the proof
of 
service reflects
that three previous service attempts were made before the 
substitute
service. (RJN, Exh. 3). The process server further attested in the proof 
of service that
mail service was made on July 7, 2023, after substitute service. 
(Id.)
 
The motion, then, is denied.” (Id.,
Exh. 9). 
 
(Order, at p. 2, filed April 4, 2024.)
 
On May 7, 2024, Defendant filed a
“Motion to Set Aside Default,” which was accompanied by a declaration from
attorney Douglas Borthwick (“Borthwick”). 
 
On June 18, 2024, the court denied
the above motion; in doing so, the court stated, in relevant part, as follows:
 
            Defendant moves
the court for an order, per Code of Civil Procedure § 473, 
subdivision (b) (‘Section 473(b)’),
setting aside the default entered against her, 
on the basis of mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. . . .
 
Plaintiff argues that Defendant’s
motion should be denied pursuant to Even Zohar 
Const. & Remodeling, Inc. v.
Bellaire Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 830 for 
failure to comply with Code of
Civil Procedure § 1008 (‘Section 1008’)[4]. Even

Zohar
held that section 1008 governs renewed applications under section 473,
subdivision (b) for relief from default based on an attorney’s sworn affidavit 
attesting to his
or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect.[5]
 
In this case, Defendant filed her
first Motion to Set Aside Default on February 16, 
2024, on the basis that she ‘was
not validly served with process of the Summons 
and did not receive actual notice
she was a named party in this matter in time to 
defend against the action. See Code
of Civil Procedure (‘CCP’) §§ 415.20(b) and 
473(b).’ (RJN, Exh. 6). While
Defendant referenced only Section § 473(b) in her 
notice of motion, the court noted
that Defendant was primarily arguing improper 
service, ‘which is a subdivision
(d) argument. . . or possibly a lack of actual notice, 
which is a Code of Civil Procedure
§ 473.5 argument . . .’ The court, however, also 
noted that “Defendant also
reference[d] surprise and extrinsic fraud in on [sic] page 
4 of her motion.” The court noted
that ‘Defendant’s motion. . . [was] not 
accompanied by any declaration
whatsoever, either disavowing valid service or 
setting forth facts supporting her
argument based on actual notice, surprise and 
extrinsic fraud’ and denied the
motion. 
 
In this instant motion, it is
unclear to the court whether or not Defendant seeks 
mandatory Section § 473(b) relief
pursuant to attorney affidavit of fault.[6] ‘[W]hen 
faced with a motion for relief
under section 473, the trial court does not have to 
consider the availability of relief
under the mandatory provision unless such relief
is requested in an appropriate
manner.” (Luri v. Greenwald (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 
1119, 1126).
Regardless, even if it is made pursuant to attorney affidavit of fault,
Borthwick’s declaration fails to state that Defendant’s default was entered as
a 
result of his ‘mistake,
inadvertence, surprise or neglect.’
 
The record reflects that
Plaintiff’s request for entry of default was rejected on 
August 14, 2023 as premature. On
August 17, 2023, Defendant’s default was 
entered. (RJN, Exh, 3). On August
21, 2023, Defendant purported to file her 
answer. (Id., Exh. 4.) Borthwick’s
declaration is silent with respect to the 
August 17-21,
2023 time period and why Default’s answer was not timely filed. Borthwick
instead focuses on his conduct after Defendant’s default had already 
been entered.
Accordingly, even if Plaintiff did not have to adhere to Section § 
1008
requirements on the basis that Plaintiff first sought discretionary Code of 
Civil Procedure
§ 473(b) relief and now seeks mandatory relief pursuant to that 
same section[7], the
motion is denied on this basis.
 
Finally, Defendant’s initial motion
referenced extrinsic fraud (and mistake). (See 
RJN Exh. 6, 4:8). Defendant’s
reliance upon this ground again in her instant 
motion warrants compliance with
Section § 1008 requirements, which Defendant 
has not done.
 
The motion is denied. (Id.,
Exh. 14).” (Id., Exh. 14).
 
(Order, at p. 2, filed June 18, 2024.)
 
On June 28, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant “Motion for Mandatory Relief from Default.” As previously noted by
the court, Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 “governs renewed applications
under section 473, subdivision (b). . . for relief from default based on an
attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or neglect.” (Even Zohar, supra, 61 Cal.4th at 833.) 
 
Defendant argues that she is
entitled to mandatory relief under Code of Civil Procedure 473(b) since
Defendant’s failure to timely file an answer to Plaintiff’s complaint was due a
mistake by Borthwick. (Motion, 4:19-25.) Borthwick attests that he “attempted
to file an answer  . . . and did not
realize until after Plaintiff had moved for a default that somehow [his] Answer
had not been accepted by the court.” (Borthwick Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.) 
 
The court determines that Defendant’s
motion fails to satisfy the requirements of section 1008 showing what “new or
different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed.”  The attorney fault mandatory relief provision was
alluded to by Defendant in the second motion. However, even after three attempts,
Defendant has failed to meet the requirements of section 1008(a) and, as
important, provide the court a coherent explanation as to the reasons why
mandatory relief is warranted. 
 
Even if the court agreed that Defendant
had complied with section 1008, the result would be the same. First, the court
finds the statements made in the declaration vague and problematic, and gives
pause to the court finding mandatory relief. Second, the declaration is silent concerning
counsel’s attempt at filing the Answer. Was it before the Request for Entry of
Default was entered or after? Moreover, the more filings of this nature, the
more questions that are raised by the court. Why would an Answer albeit untimely
need to be filed if in the two prior Motions to Vacate Defendant has declared (first
motion) or argued (second motion) that service was improper or non-existent? If
an Answer needed to be filed because Defendant learned a lawsuit against her
had been filed, what were the circumstances that led to the untimely filing? The
deliberate nature of these piece-meal motions has now, on two occasions, frustrated
the court’s role in making a determination to allow this case to proceed. Nevertheless,
the court recognizes that even under the mandatory provisions of section
473(b), the court’s role is not to rubber stamp a result given the filing of a
bare bone attorney declaration. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant’s motion is denied.
