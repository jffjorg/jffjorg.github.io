And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a number of issues related to a motion for discretionary relief filed by the defendant. The judge notes that the minute order appears to contain a clerical error, and that the defendant's counsel's declarations filed after the deadline will not be considered. The judge also discusses the requirements for service of summons and the requirements for subsequent applications for orders.

The judge rejects the plaintiff's contention that the motion was not timely filed, and notes that the defendant's failure to comply with Section 1008 requirements is fatal if the defendant is seeking discretionary relief under Section 473(b). The judge also notes that the motion would be untimely, as it has been filed more than 6 months after the entry of default.

The judge references a previous case, Standard Microsystems Corp. v. Winbond Electronics Corp. (2009), which held that Section 1008 does not apply to discretionary relief under Section 473(b). The judge concludes that the defendant's initial motion was made pursuant to the discretionary relief part of Section 473(b), and therefore Section 1008 does not apply in this case.
