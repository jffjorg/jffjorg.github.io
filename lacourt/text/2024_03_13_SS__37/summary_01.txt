Significant Statements:
  - The court need not decide what damages are due, as the issue of damages owed presents a triable issue of material fact not subject to demurrer.
  - A demurrer does not lie in a portion of a cause of action.
  - The fact that Plaintiff may improperly requested holdover damages that accrue on wrong date, does not dispose of Plaintiff's unlawful detainer cause of action.

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's demurrer is overruled and the motion to strike is denied. The defendant is required to file an answer within 10 days and provide notice. The court sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Answer for March 28, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. and continues the Case Management Conference to that date and time. The defendant is also required to give notice.

The Judge's reasoning is that the demurrer fails to dispose of an entire cause of action, and the issue of damages owed presents a triable issue of material fact not subject to demurrer. The Judge also finds that the motion to strike is improper and should have been raised by way of demurrer, not a motion to strike.
