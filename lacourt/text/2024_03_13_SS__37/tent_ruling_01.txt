Background
 
On August 10, 2023,
Wilshire Crescent Heights, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Michael
Cherbakov (“Defendant”) for unlawful detainer. On October 13, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). On December 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”). 
On January 4, 2024,
Defendant filed a demurrer with a motion to strike.  Plaintiff opposes the motion. The matter is
now before the court. 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal
Standard
 
A.        Demurrer 
 A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿“To
survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)¿For the purpose of
testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth
of all material facts properly pleaded.¿ (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992)
2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)¿A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.”¿(Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67
Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿ 
 
B.        Motion
to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP, § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP, § 436(a)-(b);
Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading
which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are
surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave
to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally granted
to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Demurrer
 
            A.        Defendant Failed to Comply with the Meet
and Confer Requirement 
 
The court notes that Defendant has
failed to file a declaration showing compliance with the mandatory requirements
to meet and confer as required CCP §§ 430.41 and 435.5(a). The court has the
discretion to continue the hearing and order the parties to meaningfully meet
and confer prior to this hearing. (See Dumas v. Los Angeles County Bd. of Supervisors (2020) 45 Cal. App. 5th 348,
355.) “Any determination by the court that the meet and confer
process was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer.” (CCP § 430.41(a)(4).) As the failure to meet and confer does not
constitute grounds to overrule a demurrer, the court continues to the merits.  
 
B.        Defendant’s Demurrer Fails to Dispose of
an Entire Cause of Action
 
The SAC alleges that Plaintiff is the owner of 6245 Wilshire Blvd.
#PH205 Los Angeles, CA (the “Subject Property”). (SAC ¶¶ 1-4.) Plaintiff rented
the Subject Property to Defendant for $14,402.00 per month. (SAC ¶ 1, 6, Ex.
1.) The SAC asserts that the tenancy terminated for at-fault cause under Civ.
Code § 1946.2(b)(1) and a Notice to Pay Rent in 3 days or Quit in 30 Days was
served. (SAC ¶¶ 8, 9.) The 3 Day Notice to Quit was served on Defendant by
posting a copy on the Subject Property on June 21, 2023, giving a copy to a
person residing at the premises, and mailing a copy to the defendant on June
21, 2023. (SAC ¶ 10(a)(3).) 
 
Defendant demurs to the SAC on the basis that
Plaintiff is not entitled to holdover damages until after the 30-day notice
period has expired and the tenant has not vacated the premises. Therefore, Defendant
argues that holdover damages began to accrue on July 22, 2023, the day of the
expiration of the notice period, and not on July 1, 2023. 
 
The court need not decide what damages are due, as the issue
of damages owed presents a triable issue of material fact not subject to
demurrer. (Fuhrman v. California Satellite Systems (1986) 179 Cal.App.3d
408, 422.) Moreover, a demurrer does not lie in a portion of a cause of action.
(PH II, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1680, 1682.) The fact that Plaintiff may improperly
requested holdover damages that accrue on wrong date, does not dispose of
Plaintiff’s unlawful detainer cause of action. Accordingly, the demurrer is
overruled.
 
C.        Defendant’s Motion to Strike Improperly
Seeks to Strike the Entire SAC
 
Defendant moves to
strike the entire SAC on the basis that it does not have proper verification
pursuant to CCP §§ 446(a) and 1166. A “complaint shall [b]e verified and
include the typed or printed name of the person verifying the complaint.” (CCP
§ 1166(a)(1).)  
 
Plaintiff does not
dispute that the verification is not signed by the Plaintiff. Instead,
Plaintiff maintains that Defendant is precluded from filing a motion to strike
because the demurrer and the motion to strike must be raised at the same time.
However, Plaintiff fails to show that the demurrer and motion to strike were
not filed simultaneously. Therefore, Plaintiff’s argument is without merit.
 
Nevertheless, the motion
to strike is denied. It is improper to strike a whole cause of action pursuant
to a motion to strike. (Quiroz v. Seventh Ave. Center (2006) 140
Cal.App.4th 1256, 1281.) Such challenges must be made by demurrer. (Id.)
Defendant should have raised the issue of the SAC’s lack of verification by way
of demurrer, not via a motion to strike. 
Conclusion
 
Defendant’
demurrer is overruled. Defendant’s motion to strike is denied. Defendant to file
an 
Answer
within 10 days and to give notice. The court sets an OSC Re: Answer for March
28, 
2024,
at 8:30 a.m. and continues the Case Management Conference to that date and
time.
Defendant
to give notice.
