[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION TO EXPUNGE
  LIS PENDENS 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
December 26, 2024



 
On August 30, 2023, Plaintiff
Yellow Owl Properties Managements, Inc. filed this quiet title action against Defendant
Cristian Arturo Llamas.
On
August 31, 2023, Plaintiff recorded a Notice of Pendency of Action for the property
commonly known as 15526 Mar Vista Street, Whittier, CA 90605 (Document No. 20230582290).
On
November 18, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to expunge lis pendens.  
On
November 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed a “Notice Notice of Recorded Notice of Lis Pendens
[Pendency of Action]” in this action.
EVIDENTIARY
OBJECTIONS
Plaintiff’s
Objection Nos. 1-4 to the Declarations of Luis Castellanos and Sandra Zepeda are
sustained for lack of foundation and improper opinion.
Plaintiff’s
Objection No. 5 is overruled.
Defendant’s
Objection Nos. 1-22, 25-26 are overruled.
Defendant’s
Objection Nos. 23-24 are sustained for lack of foundation and speculation.
Defendant
submitted his own declaration (with exhibits) for the first time with his Reply.  The Court generally will not consider new evidence
submitted with a reply.¿¿(See¿Jay v. Mahaffey¿(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1522,
1537-1538.)  Even if the Court does consider
this new evidence, it does not change the Court’s decision.
REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
Plaintiff’s
request for judicial notice of the complaint, Defendant’s answer, and a court order
in this action is denied as unnecessary because these items are already part of
this case’s record.
Plaintiff’s
request for judicial notice of a trial order in another case is denied as irrelevant.
DISCUSSION
When
a party asserts a real property claim, that party may record a notice of pendency
of action in the office of the county recorder. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 405.20.)  Before
recording the notice, the claimant must mail a copy to all parties to whom the real
property claim is adverse and to all owners of record of the real property affected
by the real property claim.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 405.22.)  Immediately after recording the
notice, a copy of the notice shall be filed with the court.  (Ibid.)  If these requirements are not met and if a proof
of service is not recorded with the notice of pendency of action, the notice is
void and invalid.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.23.)
After
the notice of pendency of action is recorded, a party or nonparty with an interest
in the property may apply to expunge the notice.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.30.)  The Court must order the notice expunged if the
pleading on which the notice is based does not contain a real property claim or
if the claimant has not established the probable validity of the real property claim.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 405.31, 405.32.)
A.        Plaintiff Substantially Complied with
the Service Requirements, and Defendant Had Actual Notice.
Defendant
argues that the lis pendens is invalid because Plaintiff did not comply with the
procedural rules.  (Motion at pp. 6-7.)  As of the date Defendant filed the motion, “Plaintiff
still has not filed the lis pendens with the Court nor does it appear that it was
served on the Defendant.”  (Id. at
p. 7.)
“[A]
party alleging a lis pendens is ‘void and invalid’ (§ 405.23) for defective service
may move for expungement on that basis.” 
(Rey Sanchez Investments v. Superior Court (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th
259, 263.)  “The notice requirement is intended
to assure that property owners receive prompt notice of the recording of a lis pendens.”  (Biddle v. Superior Court (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d
135, 137.)  Substantial compliance that unquestionably
conveys prompt actual notice satisfies the purpose of the statute.  (Id. at pp. 137-138)  A party may also waive any service defects by
waiting too long to assert them.  (Id.
at p. 138.)
Plaintiff
did not file a notice of its lis pendens in this action until November 21, 2024,
after Defendant filed this motion.  However,
Defendant’s motion demonstrates that he had actual notice.  Moreover, Plaintiff has shown that it substantially
complied with the service requirements and that Defendant had actual notice during
his entire involvement in this action.
On
August 30, 2023, the notice of pendency of action was mailed to Defendant at two
different mailing addresses.  (Carter Decl.
¶ 9.)  To support his contention that the
notice was never served on him, Defendant provides a copy of the USPS website printout
with tracking numbers used for Plaintiff’s certified mail, which shows a last status
of “Moving Through Network” on September 4, 2023 and no delivery date.  (Motion at p. 7 & Ex. B.)  In response, Plaintiff provides copies of the
signed Domestic Return Receipts with the same tracking numbers, proving delivery.  (Opposition, Ex. 17.)
Additionally,
on September 18 and 19, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendant and his counsel
copies of, among other things, the complaint and the recorded copy of the notice
of pendency of action.  (Carter Decl. ¶¶ 10-11
& Exs. 18-19.)  The proof of service of
the summons filed on October 4, 2023 also includes the Notice of Pendency of Action
in the list of documents that were served on September 28, 2023.
Under
these circumstances, the Court finds that Plaintiff substantially complied with
the notice requirements and that Defendant had actual notice of the lis pendens.
Defendant
filed an answer on December 4, 2023, engaged in discovery, opposed Plaintiff’s motion
for a protective order, deposed Plaintiff’s officers/directors, and posted jury
fees.  Defendant did not assert any service
defects until almost 15 months after this action was filed, and almost 14 months
after he was served with the summons, notice, and other documents.  Accordingly, the Court also finds that Defendant
has waived the defects in service.
B.        Plaintiff Has Established the Probable
Validity of the Real Property Claim.
The
court shall order that a notice of lis pendens be expunged if the claimant has not
established by a preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the real
property claim.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 405.32.)  “Probable validity ‘means that it is more likely
than not that the claimant will obtain a judgment against the defendant on the claim.’  (§ 405.3.) 
Thus, when presented with a pretrial motion to expunge a lis pendens, the
court must grant the motion unless the claimant establishes by a preponderance
of the evidence the probable validity of the real property claim.”  (De Martini v. Superior Court (2024) 98
Cal.App.5th 1269, 1279, quotation marks omitted.)
Plaintiff’s
claim to the property is based on Defendant allegedly recording a forged deed that
granted the property from Plaintiff to himself. 
On December 16, 2015, Sandra and Jesse Zepeda transferred the property via
grant deed with 95% to Plaintiff and 5% to Defendant.  (Complaint ¶ 17.)  On September 12, 2016, Mara Llamas quitclaimed
her interest (if any) to Christian Arturo Llamas.  (Complaint ¶ 18.)  On October 26, 2016, Defendant signed a grant
deed transferring the property to Plaintiff. 
(Complaint ¶ 19 & Ex. 2.)  After
that, Plaintiff held full title to the property.  (Complaint ¶ 13.)  On June 16, 2023, a quitclaim deed dated November
22, 2019 was recorded.  (Complaint ¶¶ 25-26.)  The deed was purportedly signed by Arturo Llamas,
as Plaintiff’s President, to transfer title of the property to Defendant.  (Complaint ¶ 26.)  Plaintiff alleges that the 2019 quitclaim deed
does not contain Arturo Llamas’s true signature.  (Complaint ¶ 27.)
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff cannot offer any evidence to establish the probable validity
of its claims because Plaintiff has no basis for the allegation that the signature
on the deed in question was forged.  (Motion
at p. 6.)  According to Defendant, Plaintiff’s
representatives “admit the signature is valid and/or they do not have a legitimate
basis to claim otherwise.”  (Id. at
pp. 3-4.)
During
Jessica Llamas’s deposition, she was asked if the deed contained her father’s signature,
and she responded, “It appears to be.”  (Motion
at p. 4; Motion, Ex. C at p. 72.)  Jessica
was also asked, “But you—you confirmed this is his signature, to your knowledge,
correct?” and she responded, “I repeat that I said it assumes to be, yes.”  (Motion at p. 4; Motion, Ex. C at p. 73.)  Finally, she was asked, “Has anybody other than
your lawyer told you that that’s not your father’s signature on Exhibit—on page
150?” to which she responded, “No.”  (Motion
at p. 4; Motion, Ex. C at pp. 74-75.)
During
Claudia Llamas’s deposition, she was asked whose signature was on the deed, and
she responded, “My father’s.”  (Motion at
p. 4; Motion, Ex. D at p. 56.)  She had “no
idea” who signed it, and said that she did not think her father signed it because
“[h]e wouldn’t gift this house for him for free.”  (Motion at p. 4; Motion, Ex. D at p. 57.)  Claudia saw someone notarized her father’s signature
a few times, but she did not know what was being notarized or why.  (Motion at pp. 4-5; Motion, Ex. D at pp. 62-63.)  She was then asked, “So you don’t know if this
quitclaim deed, page 150, is one of those things that you witnessed with your own
eyes your dad signing; do you?” and she responded, “No, I’m not sure.”  (Motion at p. 5; Motion, Ex. D at pp. 62-63.)
These
responses from Jessica and Claudia Llamas that the signature “appears to be” Arturo’s
and they did not know if the deed is one of the documents that they saw be notarized
are only slight evidence in Defendant’s favor that suggests that Arturo’s signature
on the 2019 deed is authentic and therefore a valid transfer.  These are not unequivocal denials that the signature
is Arturo’s, but they are also not express confirmation that the signature is authentic.
The
notary who notarized Arturo’s signature on the 2019 deed “[verifies] that Arturo
Llamas is the person who signed it,” the signature is valid, and all necessary protocols
were followed.  (Castellanos Decl. ¶ 4.)  This is also slight evidence in Defendant’s favor;
however, the notary lost his notary journal to theft on October 1, 2020, so his
testimony is the only evidence.  (Castellanos
Decl. ¶ 5.)
Sandra
Zepeda, the prior owner of the property, declares that she has “a clear memory of
the transaction” when she sold the property to Defendant in 2016, and she “always
understood and believed that the buyer was Cristian Llamas.”  (Zepeda Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.)  This is contradicted by the December
16, 2015 grant deed from “Sandra Zepeda and Jesse Zepeda, Husband and Wife as Joint
Tenants” to “Yellow Owl Properties Managements, Inc., a California Corporation as
to an undivided 95% interest and Cristian Arturo Llamas, a married man as his sole
and separate property as to an undivided 5% interest.”  (Complaint, Ex. 1.)  Sandra Zepeda cannot credibly “confirm[] that
the buyer was the Defendant in this action” (Motion at p. 5) when Defendant received
only a 5% interest.  This third-party declaration
has no evidentiary value.
In
response, Plaintiff focuses on evidence of Arturo’s intent and the totality of the
control over the property since the 2019 deed. 
(See Opposition at pp. 6-11.)
Defendant
stopped providing services for Plaintiff in 2018.  (J. Llamas Decl. ¶ 13.)  Claudia began working for Plaintiff in 2015, and
Jessica began working for Plaintiff in 2019. 
(J. Llamas Decl. ¶¶ 12, 14.)  Since
2019, Claudia and Jessica have been involved in managing the properties owned by
Plaintiff.  (J. Llamas Decl. ¶ 15.)  As of July 30, 2019, Arturo
named Claudia as Plaintiff’s CFO, Jessica as Secretary, and Arturo and Claudia as
the only Directors.  (J. Llamas Decl. ¶¶ 17-18
& Ex. 4 [Statement of Information]; see C. Llamas Decl. ¶ 4.)  They remained in these roles as of the November
22, 2019 deed.  (J. Llamas Decl. ¶ 22.)  Also, by the end of October 2019, Plaintiff held
full title to the property.  (Complaint ¶¶
13, 19 & Ex. 2.)  
Plaintiff’s
January 21, 2022, November 9, 2022, and November 22, 2023 Statements of Information
name Claudia as CEO and CFO, Jessica as Secretary, and both of them as the only
two Directors.  (J. Llamas Decl. ¶¶ 34-36
& Exs. 9-11; see C. Llamas Decl. ¶ 3.) 
Jessica and Claudia have never seen the 2019 deed, which states there is
no transfer tax and has “gift” written on it. 
(J. Llamas Decl. ¶¶ 21, 24; C. Llamas Decl. ¶ 5; see J. Llamas Decl. ¶ 28.)  Arturo never mentioned that he was going to have
Plaintiff transfer the property to Defendant, and there was no board discussion
or approval of the transfer.  (J. Llamas Decl.
¶¶ 23, 27; see C. Llamas Decl. ¶ 7.)
This
evidence of Jessica’s and Claudia’s involvement in Plaintiff and unawareness of
Plaintiff’s purported transfer supports Plaintiff’s assertion that it did not validly
transfer title to the property to Defendant via Arturo.  Arturo’s treatment of Plaintiff, the property,
and the individuals during his lifetime further casts doubts on him validly transferring
the property from Plaintiff to Defendant. 
Arturo amended his trust to grant Jessica and Claudia each a 50% interest
in Plaintiff upon his death, and he provided nothing for Defendant.  (J. Llamas Decl. ¶ 33.)  This division is consistent with Arturo’s decisions
for Plaintiff’s management: as of July 30, 2019, Arturo named Claudia as Plaintiff’s
CFO, Jessica as Secretary, and Arturo and Claudia as the only Directors.  (J. Llamas Decl. ¶¶ 17-18 & Ex. 4 [Statement
of Information]; see C. Llamas Decl. ¶ 4.) 
Arturo’s failure to include Defendant in both the division of his trust and
the management of Plaintiff (the property owner) strongly suggests that he would
not transfer property ownership from Plaintiff to Defendant.
Other
evidence shows that since 2019, Defendant has not acted in a manner that is consistent
with ownership.  “A person who exercises acts
of ownership over property is presumed to be the owner of it.”  (Evid. Code, § 638; see Motion at pp. 9-10.)  Defendant argues that Evidence Code section 638
“relates to personal property, not real property.”  (Reply at p. 2.)  Not so. 
(See, e.g., Kunza v. Gaskell (1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 201, 208 [possession
conferred title to real property in the absence of other evidence, citing section
638].)
Jessica
has lived at the subject property since December 2015, and Claudia lived there from
December 2015 through March 2021.  (J. Llamas
Decl. ¶¶ 19-20.)  Plaintiff continued to pay
the taxes, improve the property, and manage the property.  (J. Llamas Decl. ¶¶ 29-30 & Exs. 5-6 [2019-2022
tax statements and invoice for improvements].)
Defendant
argues that he also lived at the property “on and off through January 2022,” made
tax payments, and required maintenance be paid by Plaintiff.  (Reply at pp. 5-6; Reply, C. Llamas Decl. ¶¶ 5-6.)  The “record of tax payment for the Property which
[Defendant]  personally made” is a photograph
of an Annual Secured Property Tax Bill and payment receipt.  (Reply, C. Llamas Decl., Ex. 3.)  It does not identify any property or payor, and
it has no apparent evidentiary value.  Defendant
also contends that he “continued to receive reports from my father and indeed texts
from Claudia” about work for Plaintiff.  (Reply,
C. Llamas Decl. ¶ 4.)  The attached exhibit
contains text messages from March 2019 of a few short Spanish phrases without context
(presumably from Arturo) and an unidentifiable photo from Jessica.  (Reply, C. Llamas Decl., Ex. 2.)  This exhibit has no apparent evidentiary value
with respect to Defendant’s actions after the purported November 22, 2019 transfer.  On the other hand, Plaintiff’s evidence includes
full copies of Annual Secured Property Tax Bills addressed to Plaintiff for the
property at issue.  (Opposition, Ex. 5.)  Plaintiff’s evidence shows that it was Plaintiff,
not Defendant, who paid the property taxes for 2019-2022, consistent with the obligations
of the true owner of the property.
Defendant
did not attempt to assert any ownership rights from the November 22, 2019 purported
transfer until the July 6, 2023 sixty-day notice to pay or quit served on Jessica
and Claudia.  (See Complaint ¶ 31; C. Llamas
Decl. ¶¶ 25-26.)  Defendant’s failure to collect
rent after the purported transfer, failure to assert any right to the property before
Arturo’s death, and failure to pay property taxes on a property purportedly held
in his own name do not suggest that any property transfer was valid since 2019.  (See Huth v. Katz (1947) 30 Cal.2d 605,
609.)
Plaintiff
also appears to argue that regardless of the deed’s signature, Arturo could not
have transferred the property to Defendant in his lifetime because he did not deliver
the deed to Defendant.  (See Opposition at
pp. 10-11.)  “A grant takes effect, so as
to vest the interest intended to be transferred, only upon its delivery by the grantor.”  (Civ. Code, § 1054.)  Defendant’s discovery responses suggest that the
2019 deed was not delivered to him to cause the property transfer during Arturo’s
lifetime.  According to Defendant, he did
not record the 2019 deed earlier than June 16, 2023 “because it had been misplaced.”  (Opposition, Ex. 22 [Special Rog Nos. 7-8].)  Defendant found the deed in the attic at another
property “[a]round the time it was recorded” “[b]y looking through boxes in the
attic.”  (Opposition, Ex. 23 [Special Rog
Nos. 9-12].)
Only
in his Reply does Defendant argue that title to the property passed “irrespective
of whether the deed is recorded and irrespective of whether delivery is accompanied
by change of possession,” and “neither recording nor possession of the property
in question is relevant where, as here, the deed has been delivered to the grantee.”  (Reply at pp. 1-2; see Civ. Code, § 1217 [“An
unrecorded instrument is valid as between the parties thereto and those who have
notice thereof.”].)  Defendant declares that
“[t]he deed in question was delivered from my father Arturo Llamas, as president
of Yellow Owl, to me, on the date he signed it,” and Defendant placed the deed in
the attic of his business “until [he] went searching for it and found it in 2023.”  (Reply, C. Llamas Decl. ¶ 2.)
At
this stage of the proceedings, the Court need not decide the issue of whether the
transfer is valid due to the deed’s purported delivery to Defendant.  The totality of other evidence tends to disprove
Arturo’s intent to transfer the property to Defendant, thereby demonstrating some
validity of the asserted claims.  (See Opposition
at pp. 11-12.)
Additionally,
Defendant first began claiming ownership and management of Plaintiff around January
29, 2024—five months after Plaintiff filed this action—when he filed an unauthorized
statement of information for Plaintiff naming him as the CEO, CFO, Secretary, and
sole Director of Plaintiff.  (J. Llamas Decl.
¶ 37 & Ex. 12.)  Defendant offers no explanation
for this conduct, which further impugns his credibility.
The
Court finds that Plaintiff has established by a preponderance of the evidence the
probable validity of the real property claim, and the lis pendens should not be
expunged.
CONCLUSION
The
Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens is DENIED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
