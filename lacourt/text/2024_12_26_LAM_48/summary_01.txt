And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatories. The plaintiff had provided partial responses to the interrogatories, but the defendant deemed them insufficient. The plaintiff's objections to providing full information, including that the requested information is "public information" and documents "speak for themselves," are overruled. The plaintiff is ordered to provide supplemental responses to the interrogatories within 30 days. The request for sanctions is denied.
