TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF’S
  REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT 
 



 
Plaintiff LVNV Funding LLC (“Plaintiff”) requests entry of
default judgment against Defendant Stephen C Dimon. Plaintiff seeks judgment in the total amount of $61,541.08, comprising
$53,235.45 demanded in the Complaint, $5,817.42 in interest, $533.50 in costs, and
$1,954.71 in attorney fees.   
The Court notes one defect with the submitted default
judgment package. 
As set forth above, Plaintiff requests $5,817.42 in
interest. However, as discussed in the Court’s October 13, 2023 minute order on
Plaintiff’s previous request for default judgment, Plaintiff does not appear to
allege in the Complaint that it seeks any interest. The Court notes that “[a] complaint or cross-complaint shall contain…the following:…(2) A demand for judgment for the relief to which the pleader
claims to be entitled. If the recovery of money or damages is demanded, the
amount demanded shall be stated.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 425.10, subd. (a)(2).) “[I]n all default
judgments the demand sets a ceiling on recovery.” (Finney
v. Gomez (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th
527, 534.) “A trial court has no
jurisdiction to grant a plaintiff more relief against a defaulting defendant
than is asked for in the complaint.” (Feminist Women's Health Center v. Blythe (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1641, 1675.)
Based on the foregoing, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request
for default judgment without prejudice. Plaintiff to schedule a date for
submitting a new default judgment package.
