And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendant, Stephen C Dimon, without prejudice. The plaintiff had requested a default judgment in the amount of $61,541.08, but the court notes that the complaint does not allege any interest. The court cites Code of Civil Procedure section 425.10 and several California appellate court cases to state that a complaint must contain a demand for judgment, and that a trial court has no jurisdiction to grant a plaintiff more relief than is asked for in the complaint. The court orders the plaintiff to schedule a new date to submit a default judgment package.
