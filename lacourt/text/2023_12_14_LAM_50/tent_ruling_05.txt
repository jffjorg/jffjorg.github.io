TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:  
 
PETITION TO
  CONFIRM MINOR’S COMPROMISE



            
            Background
            On May 10, 2018,
Plaintiffs Elizabeth Noemy Zetino, Jessica Ivonne Zetino Morales, and
Harlynn Amerylise Zetino Lopez, a minor, by and through her Guardian ad Litem,
Elizabeth Noemy Zetino (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed the instant action
against Defendants 15025 Saticoy Street, Inc. and Anza Management Company. 
Plaintiffs filed the
operative First Amended Habitability Complaint (“FAC”) on September 11, 2019
against Defendants 15025 Saticoy Street, Inc., Anza Management Company, and J.K.
Residential Services, Inc. The FAC alleges causes of action for (1) violation of Civil Code section
1942.4, (2) tortious breach of the warranty of habitability, (3) private
nuisance, (4) Business & Professions Code § 17200 et seq., and (5)
negligence.
The parties have
reached a settlement in this matter. Elizabeth Noemy Zetino as Petitioner for Claimant Harlynn
Amerylise Zetino Lopez (“Petitioner”) now petitions for
the Court’s approval of the settlement on behalf of the Claimant.  
On December 1, 2023, the Court issued a minute order in this action
providing, inter alia, that “[h]ere, the petition is prepared on
form MC-350 and is verified by the Petitioner. However, the Court notes that
Item 14 of the petition (Form MC-350) is blank…Based on the foregoing, the
Court intends to grant the petition and approve the compromise, subject to
Petitioner filing a corrected Form MC-350 prior to the hearing that corrects
the defect identified above, and subject to Plaintiffs’ examination of
Petitioner at the hearing. On the Court’s own motion, the Hearing on Petition
to Confirm Minor’s Compromise scheduled for 12/01/2023 is continued to 12/14/23
at 10:00 AM in Department 50 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse. The minor does not
need to be present on the above continued date.” On November 30, 2023,
Petitioner filed a revised petition. 
            Discussion
An
enforceable settlement of a minor’s claim can only be consummated with court
approval. (Prob. Code, § 3500.) The petition must be verified by the
petitioner, must contain a full disclosure of all information that has any
bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise, and must be prepared on
judicial council form MC-350. (California Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)  
Here,
the petition is prepared on form MC-350 and is verified by the Petitioner. The defect previously identified by the Court has been
corrected in the revised petition. 
            Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the Court intends to grant the
revised petition and approve the compromise, subject to Plaintiffs’ examination
of Petitioner at the hearing. Petitioner is to give notice of this ruling.
