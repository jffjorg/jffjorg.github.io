California Restoration, LLC’s Motion to Strike
Portions of Complaint is granted with 20 days leave to amend.
 
            Background
 
            Plaintiff filed the Complaint on June
20, 2024. Plaintiff alleges the following facts. Plaintiff suffered a water
leak. Plaintiff contacted Defendants to repair and remediate the condition. Defendants
did not have a proper contractors’ license and failed to properly repair and
remediate the condition. Plaintiff alleges causes of action for: 1. Breach of
Contract; 2. Intentional Misrepresentation; 3. Negligent Misrepresentation; 4. Negligence;
5. Violation of Bus. & Prof. Code 7160; 6. Violation of Bus. & Prof.
Code 17200 - Unfair Business Practices; 7. Declaratory Relief. 
 
            Meet
and Confer 

            Defendant set forth an adequate meet
and confer declaration in compliance with CCP § 430.41 and CCP § 435.5.  (Declarations, Daniella Litvak.) 
 
Demurrer
 
            A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law and raises
only questions of law. (Schmidt v. Foundation Health (1995) 35
Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In testing the
sufficiency of the complaint, the court must assume the truth of (1) the
properly pleaded factual allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred
from those expressly pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) 
The Court may not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of
fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe
(1994) 7 Cal.App.4th 634, 638.)  Because
a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint, the plaintiff must show
that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to establish every element of each
cause of action.  (Rakestraw v.
California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.)  Where the complaint fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the
demurrer.  (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig
v. County of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
 
Sufficient facts are the essential facts
of the case "with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently
specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his
cause of action.”  (Gressley v.
Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.)  "Whether the plaintiff will be able to
prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer."  (Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.)  Under Code
Civil Procedure § 430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is
“uncertain.”  Uncertainty exists where a
complaint’s factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently
apprise a defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
            Defendant demurs to the second and third causes of
action of the Complaint on the grounds that the causes of action fail to state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and are uncertain. CCP § 430.10(e)(f).
 
            Second Cause of Action for Intentional
Misrepresentation
 
            Defendant’s demurrer to the second cause
of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. Plaintiff fails to state
facts sufficient to state a cause of action.
 
            “A complaint for fraud must allege
the following elements: (1) a knowingly false representation by the defendant;
(2) an intent to deceive or induce reliance; (3) justifiable reliance by the
plaintiff; and (4) resulting damages.”  Service
by Medallion, Inc. v. Clorox Co. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816. “[T]he
elements of an action for fraud and deceit based on a concealment are: (1) the
defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant
must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the
defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the
intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of
the fact and would not have acted as he did if he has known of the concealed or
suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.” Boschma v. Home Loan
Center, Inc. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 230, 248.
 
“Every element of the cause of action for fraud must
be alleged in the proper manner and the facts constituting the fraud must be
alleged with sufficient specificity to allow defendant to understand fully the
nature of the charge made.”  Tarmann
v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.  Plaintiff must state facts which “show how,
when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were
tendered.”  Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645. “The requirement of specificity in a fraud action
against a corporation requires the plaintiff to allege the names of the persons
who made the allegedly fraudulent representations, their authority to speak, to
whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or written.” Tarmann
v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.
 
Plaintiff has alleged facts regarding the alleged
misrepresentation – licensure to perform the remediation, who made the
representations – Jim Monroe and Cindy, when they were made – September 5, 2023
and September 26, 2023, to whom they were made – to Plaintiff, and how, by what
means, and where they were made – by telephone. However, Plaintiff has failed
to set forth facts regarding Jim Monroe and Cindy’s authority to make the
representation for Defendant. Plaintiff has also failed to set forth specific facts
as to Defendant’s knowledge of the falsity of the representation and
Defendant’s intent to deceive. Plaintiff merely set forth conclusions.
 
Thus, the demurrer to the second cause of action is
sustained with 20 days leave to amend.

Third Cause of Action for Negligent Misrepresentation
 
            Defendant’s demurrer to the third cause
of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. Plaintiff fails to state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
 
“For a claim of negligent misrepresentation, [a]
plaintiff must prove the following in order to recover[:] [M]isrepresentation
of a past or existing material fact, without reasonable ground for believing it
to be true, and with intent to induce another's reliance on the fact
misrepresented; ignorance of the truth and justifiable reliance on the
misrepresentation by the party to whom it was directed; and resulting damage.” Goonewardene
v. ADP, LLC (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 154, 175. 
Negligent misrepresentation is a species of fraud and requires
specificity in pleading.  See Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc.
(2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184-85. 

 
Plaintiff has failed to set forth facts regarding Jim
Monroe and Cindy’s authority to make the representation for Defendant.
Plaintiff has also failed to set forth specific facts as to Defendant’s lack of
reasonable grounds for believing the representation to be true and Defendant’s
intent to induce reliance upon the misrepresentation. Plaintiff merely set
forth conclusions.
 
Thus, the demurrer to the third cause of action is
sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Motion to
Strike  
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. 
CCP § 436(a).  The court may also
strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with
the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.  CCP § 436(b). 
The grounds for a motion to strike are that the pleading has irrelevant,
false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with
laws.  CCP § 436.  The grounds for moving to strike must appear
on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.  CCP § 437.
 
Defendant moves to strike the following item: “Page 9, (paragraph 2 of the Prayer), line 4 --
Strike: “For punitive and exemplary damages in an amount to be determined at
trial.” (Notice of Motion, page 2, line 3.)
 
Civ. Code, § 3294 states, in relevant part:
“(a) In an action for the breach of an obligation not
arising from contract, where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that
the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff,
in addition to the actual damages, may recover damages for the sake of example
and by way of punishing the defendant.
(b) An employer shall not be liable for damages
pursuant to subdivision (a), based upon acts of an employee of the employer,
unless the employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and
employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of
others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the damages are
awarded or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. With respect
to a corporate employer, the advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization,
ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an
officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation.”
 
The motion to strike is granted with 20 days leave to
amend for the same reasons set forth in the Court’s order sustaining the
demurrer to the second and third causes of action. There are no specific facts
of malice, oppression, or fraud. In addition, as noted above, the demurrer to
the fraud cause of action was sustained. 
 
To state a claim for punitive damages, Plaintiff must
allege specific facts rather than conclusions that Defendant’s conduct
constitutes oppression, fraud, or malice. Brousseau v. Jarrett (1977) 73
Cal.App.3d 864, 872. Here, Plaintiff has failed to state sufficient specific
facts to allege that Defendant acted willfully, maliciously, intentionally,
and/or recklessly to support Plaintiff’s prayer for punitive damages. Only
conclusory allegations are set forth. In addition, Plaintiff has failed to
allege facts to meet the requirements of Civ. Code § 3294(b) regarding
imposition of punitive damages against an employer based on the purported acts
of its employee(s) – here, namely Jim Monroe and Cindy.
 
Therefore, the motion to strike is granted with 20
days leave to amend.
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
