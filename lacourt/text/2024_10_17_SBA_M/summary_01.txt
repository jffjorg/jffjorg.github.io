And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied, without prejudice, Blake Williams' motion for leave to file a Third Amended Complaint. The motion was opposed by the City of Torrance, et al. The Judge found that the proposed Third Amended Complaint failed to meet the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(b), as it did not provide sufficient details about when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered and why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The Judge also noted that the proposed complaint includes allegations of conduct on the part of the defendants that occurred after the filing of the initial pleading, which would require a supplemental complaint rather than an amended complaint. The Judge has set a hearing date for a renewed motion for leave to file a Third Amended Complaint and will continue the motion for summary judgment to the same date.
