And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint and the motion to strike portions of the complaint in the case of Heather Mazur v. California Restoration, LLC, et al. The court sustains the demurrer to the second and third causes of action for intentional misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation, respectively, with 20 days leave to amend. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for these claims, as the allegations are too general and lack specificity. The court also grants the motion to strike the prayer for punitive and exemplary damages with 20 days leave to amend, as the plaintiff has failed to allege specific facts to support this claim. The court notes that the plaintiff has failed to allege facts regarding the authority of Jim Monroe and Cindy to make representations on behalf of the defendant, and that there are no specific facts of malice, oppression, or fraud. The court orders the defendant to give notice of this ruling.
