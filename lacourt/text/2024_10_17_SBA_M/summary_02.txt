And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has deemed the motion to compel further responses to the request for production of documents, set one, moot because the defendant has already served a further response on September 24, 2024. The plaintiff's reply still takes issue with the further responses and the documents produced, but the propriety of the further responses is not at issue in this motion. The judge notes that a new motion to compel service of further responses or to compel compliance with a response would require a meaningful meet and confer process and a meet and confer declaration. The judge urges the parties to meet and confer in good faith to avoid the necessity of further court intervention. Additionally, the judge notes that the motion was not properly identified as a motion to compel “further” responses, and also set on the motion calendar as a motion to compel initial responses.
