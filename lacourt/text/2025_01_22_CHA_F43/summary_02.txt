And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to set aside and vacate the default and default judgment. The defendant claimed that she failed to respond to the complaint due to mistake and excusable neglect, as her insurance carrier, State Farm, told her that it would handle the response. However, the judge found that the defendant failed to present evidence from State Farm explaining why it failed to respond to the complaint. The judge also found that the defendant delayed filing the motion to vacate, and that the plaintiff would be prejudiced if the default and default judgment were set aside. The judge concluded that the defendant failed to make sufficient showings of State Farm's justification for not responding and diligence, and that the plaintiff established how she would suffer prejudice in her finances and other cases if the default and default judgment were set aside.
