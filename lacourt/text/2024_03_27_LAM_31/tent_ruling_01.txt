I.          MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, OR IN THE
ALTERNATIVE, SUMMARY ADJUDICATION
 
This is a discrimination, retaliation, and wrongful
termination case.  On April 29, 2021, Plaintiff,
Carlos Chavez, filed a Complaint against Defendants, Schlumberger Technology Corporation
and Timothy Ramey, alleging causes of action for (1) Interference with Right to
Medical Leave under the California Family Rights Act, (2) Retaliation for Taking
Medical Leave under the California Family Rights Act, (3) Retaliation for Taking
Medical Leave, (4) Discrimination, (5) Failure to Accommodate, (6) Failure to
Engage in the Interactive Process, (7) Harassment, (8) Failure to Prevent
Harassment, Discrimination, and Retaliation, and (9) Wrongful Discharge in
Violation of Public Policy.  The Seventh Cause of Action for Harassment
is the only cause of action asserted against Ramey.  
 
On September 1, 2023, Defendants filed this motion for summary
judgment, or in the alternative, summary adjudication.   
 
On March 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition.[1]  
 
On March 13, 2024, Defendants replied.  Defendants concurrently filed a request to
supplement the record. 
 
On March 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed an objection to
Defendants’ request to supplement. 
Alternatively, Plaintiff requests an opportunity to respond to
Defendants’ new evidence.  
 
            The court will
allow Defendants to supplement the record and to allow Plaintiff to
respond.  Accordingly, the hearing for
Defendants’ motion is CONTINUED to May 6, 2024 at 8:30 AM.  
 
            Plaintiff’s
response to Defendants’ reply is due by April 17, 2024.  Plaintiff may file a response brief not to
exceed 5 pages and a separate statement not to exceed 3 pages.
 
II.        MOTION TO
CONTINUE TRIAL
 
            Defendants move for an order continuing the trial date due
to defense counsel’s lack of availability for trial on June 24, 2024.  
 
            Chavez does
not oppose a trial continuance but argues that any trial continuance should
likewise include a continuance of discovery and all other trial-related
deadlines.  Chavez further requests a
trial continuance to August 19, 2024 or November 18, 2024.
 
            In reply,
Defendants do not oppose a continuance of discovery and trial-related dates nor
do they oppose Plaintiff’s proposed dates for a trial continuance.
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendants’ motion to continue trial
is GRANTED.  The court continues the jury
trial to August 19, 2024 at 10:00 AM.¿ All discovery cut-off dates, all
pretrial deadlines including discovery, expert, and motion cut-off dates are
continued to the new trial date of August 19, 2024.
