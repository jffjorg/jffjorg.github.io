[1] The court notes that Chavez filed
a Separate Statement that spans 675 pages.  “The separate statement serves two important
functions in a summary judgment proceeding: It notifies the parties which
material facts are at issue, and it provides a convenient and expeditious
vehicle permitting the trial court to hone in on the truly disputed facts.” (Collins v. Hertz Corp. (2006) 144
Cal.App.4th 64, 74, 50 Cal.Rptr.3d 149; see also Beltran v. Hard Rock Hotel
Licensing, Inc. (2023) 97 Cal.App.5th 865, 874-876 (reprimanding the
parties for including facts in separate statement that were not “material”
under any interpretation).)  Although
Plaintiff bookmarked his separate statement, there is little else that is
convenient or expeditious about a 675 page separate statement.
