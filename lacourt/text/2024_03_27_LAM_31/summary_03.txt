And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Elena Svistina v. Advanced Properties, LLC, et al. (Case No. 21STCV44080). The case concerns a motion by Counsel Marvin B. Adviento to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff, Elena Svistina, due to an "irreparable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship." However, the judge has found that the motion does not comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, as Counsel has failed to provide proof of service or a proposed order. The judge has continued the hearing for this motion one last time to allow Counsel to correct these defects. Counsel is directed to file and serve an amended motion by April 19, 2024, and must include the new hearing date in the amended motion. Failure to cure these defects will result in a denial of the motion to be relieved and/or sanctions.
