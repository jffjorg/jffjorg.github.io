Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel, filed by Plaintiffs Francisco M. Perez and John C. Perez, against Defendant Ford Motor Company. The motion seeks to strike Defendant's objections and compel the production of a Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) witness and responsive documents related to the purchase of a 2020 Ford Mustang, which was purchased with serious defects. The Court finds that while Plaintiffs have shown good cause for the production of the documents, they have failed to meet and confer with Defendant to resolve the discovery issues. As a result, the Court orders both parties to meet and confer to resolve their remaining discovery disputes. The Court also notes that Plaintiffs' meet and confer letter was sent on the same day as the deposition notice, which does not provide sufficient opportunity for informal resolution of the issues. The Court will issue a final ruling after considering any written opposition and reply.
