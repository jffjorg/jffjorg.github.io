And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer of defendants Robert Sheipf and Patricia Shiepf to the 4th and 6th causes of action for fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress, respectively, with leave to amend. The demurrer was filed in response to the complaint filed by plaintiff Dave Martin, which alleged causes of action for violation of Civil Code § 1940.2, breach of implied warranty of habitability, negligence, fraud, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The court finds that the 4th cause of action for fraud is insufficiently alleged, failing to allege specific facts showing misrepresentation, scienter, and intent to induce reliance. The court also finds that the 6th cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress is insufficiently alleged, failing to allege extreme and outrageous conduct and actual and proximate causation.

Additionally, the court grants the motion to strike punitive damages allegations and plaintiff's claim for attorney's fees, finding that the complaint does not set forth sufficient facts to show entitlement to punitive damages and that the claim for attorney's fees is not supported by statute, contract, or law.

The court reminds the parties of the need to comply with the requirements of the California Code of Civil Procedure and orders the moving party to give notice of the ruling.
