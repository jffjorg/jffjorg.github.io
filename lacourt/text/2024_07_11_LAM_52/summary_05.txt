And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Frederick Wayne Smith, has filed a motion to reconsider the court's order denying his prior motion to set aside the judgment. However, the court finds that the plaintiff has not shown good cause for reconsideration, as he has not identified new or different facts, circumstances, or law that would justify reconsideration. Even if the plaintiff had met this standard, the court would not change its ruling on his motion to set aside the judgment, as the plaintiff has not shown a valid basis for vacating the judgment of dismissal entered in September 2018. Therefore, the plaintiff's motion is denied.
