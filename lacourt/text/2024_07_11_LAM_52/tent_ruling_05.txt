 Case Number:  BC710454    Hearing Date:   July 11, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Frederick Wayne
Smith’s Motion for Objection/Opposition to the Order Denying Motion to Set
Aside Judgment
Plaintiff Frederick Wayne Smith filed a motion
labeled “motion for objection/opposition to the denying motion and deny to set
aside judgment on 03/26/2024.”  Plaintiff
moves the court to reconsider its order denying his prior motion to set aside
the judgment.  “The name of a motion is
not controlling, and, regardless of the name, a motion asking the trial court
to decide the same matter previously ruled on is a motion for reconsideration
under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008.”  (Powell v. County of Orange (2011)
197 Cal.App.4th 1573, 1577.)
Plaintiff does not show good cause for the court to
reconsider its order dated March 26, 2024. 
A motion for reconsideration
must be “based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).)  The moving party “shall state by affidavit…
what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be
shown.”  (Ibid.)  The moving party must also show diligence and
explain why he or she could not have presented the new or different facts or
law earlier.  (California Correctional
Peace Officers Assn. v. Virga (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 30, 46; Baldwin v.
Home Sav. of America (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1192, 1200.)  
Plaintiff’s moving papers
and supporting declarations do not identify the new or different facts,
circumstances, or law he asserts justify reconsideration.  Assuming plaintiff did so, he does not
provide an explanation for why he could not present those facts or law when he
filed the prior motion in November 2023. 
Even if plaintiff met the standard for reconsideration, the court would
not change its ruling on his motion to set aside the judgment.  Plaintiff does not show a valid basis for
vacating the judgment of dismissal the court entered in September 2018.  
Plaintiff Frederick Wayne Smith’s motion is denied.
