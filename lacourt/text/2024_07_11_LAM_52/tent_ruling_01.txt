  Case Number:  23STCV00076    Hearing Date:   July 11, 2024    Dept:  52 Order to Show Cause Re: Entry of Default Judgment 
            Plaintiff
Salvador Lopez, Jr. brings an action against defendants Advance Pipe Bending, a
business entity form unknown, and Mitchell McCray.  Both defendants have defaulted.  California Rules of Court, rule 3.110(h) provides,
“When a default is entered, the party who requested the entry of default
must obtain a default judgment against the defaulting party within 45 days
after the default was entered, unless the court has granted an extension of
time.  The court may issue an order to
show cause why sanctions should not be imposed if that party fails to obtain
entry of judgment against a defaulting party or to request an extension of time
to apply for a default judgment within that time.”
            The
clerk entered the defaults of defendants Advance Pipe Bending and Mitchell
McCray on March 19, 2024.  More than 45
days have passed.  Plaintiff did not
timely request entry of default judgment against defendants.  He filed a declaration in support of a
default judgment, a summary of the case, and a proposed judgment on form
JUD-100.  But he did not file a request
for court judgment by default on mandatory Judicial Council Form CIV-100.  The court will therefore set an order to show
cause re: why plaintiff should not pay
$100 in sanctions under rule 3.110(h). 
            Plaintiff’s application for default
judgment has several other defects.  First, plaintiff did not request dismissal of
defendants Does 1-25.  A plaintiff
seeking default judgment must submit “[a] dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment against specified
parties under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment.”  (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1800(a)(7).)  Assuming
plaintiff seeks judgment against Does 1-25, the court cannot enter a judgment
against someone using a fictitious name. 
 
Second, plaintiff’s first amended complaint does not
allege sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action against defendant
Mitchelle McCray.  “Under the ‘well
pleaded’ complaint rule, it is error to enter a default judgment on a complaint
that fails to state a cause of action against the defaulting defendant.”  (Ferraro v. Camarlinghi (2008) 161
Cal.App.4th 509, 539.)  Where “the
liability of the individual defendants” relies “upon disregard of the corporate
entity,” a complaint’s “bare conclusory allegation[s]” are insufficient for a
default judgment against the individuals. 
(Vasey v. California Dance Co. (1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 742,
748-749.)  
The first amended complaint alleges seven causes of
action: five for various FEHA violations, wrongful termination, and
whistleblower retaliation.  All seven
claims are only available against an employer, not an individual who acts on an
employer’s behalf.  (Jones v. Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42
Cal.4th 1158, 1160 [FEHA claims other than harassment]; Miklosy v. Regents
of University of California (2008) 44 Cal.4th 876, 901 [wrongful
termination]; Mewawalla v. Middleman (N.D. Cal. 2022) 601 F.Supp.3d 574,
608 [whistleblower retaliation].)  
The first amended complaint
alleges plaintiff worked for defendant Advance Pipe Bending.  (FAC, ¶¶ 4, 16.)  The complaint only specifically mentions
McCray three times: (1) naming him in the caption, (2) “Defendant MITCHELL
MCCRAY, is a managing agent of one or all of the corporate Defendants, as
defined in White v. Ultramar, Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 563” (¶ 17), and (3) “Plaintiff
reported to his supervisor Leo and/or Defendant MITCHELL MCCRAY and requested
an accommodation in the form of medical leave” (¶ 21).  None of the allegations about McCray suffice
to make him liable for plaintiff’s claims. 

Moreover, though plaintiff’s proposed judgment seeks
a judgment against McCray, the first amended complaint’s prayer for relief
states all prayers are “Against the Non-Individual Defendants Jointly and
Severally.”  (FAC, p. 26.)  The “non-individual defendants” does not
include individual Mitchell McCray.  Based
on the operative pleading, the court cannot enter any judgment against
defendant Mitchell McCray.  
Finally, a substantial portion of plaintiff’s
damages arise from a physical injury incurred in the scope of employment.  The superior court does not have jurisdiction
over claims covered by the Workers’ Compensation Act.  (Hughes v. Western MacArthur
Co. (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 951, 957.)  That act “provides the exclusive remedy for
an injury sustained by an employee in the course and scope of employment.”  (Shirvanyan v. Los Angeles Community
College District (2020) 59 Cal.App.5th 82, 105.)  In addition to the physical injury itself,
the rule “encompasses injury
‘collateral to or derivative of a compensable workplace injury’ [citation],
such as emotional distress stemming from the experience of a physical injury at
work.”  (Ibid.)  In a civil action, injured employees cannot
recover damages for emotional distress suffered “because” a body part “was
injured, or because” their “injury was painful, or because” their “injury
prevented [them] from working.”  (Id.
at pp. 105-106.)  They can, however,
recover damages for emotional distress suffered “on account of the way the
[employer] treated [them] because of” their physical “limitations.”  (Id. at p. 106.)
Here, plaintiff seeks
recovery for emotional distress caused by the injury.  His declaration in support of this
application states: “This accident also caused additional stress in my
marriage.”  (Lopez Decl., ¶ 16.)  “I lost sleep because of the pain and was
very agitated and was in [a] bad mood.” 
(Id., ¶ 17.)  “The lasting
effects of the injury… have caused me to experience pain.”  (Id., ¶ 18.)  Workers’ compensation is the exclusive remedy
for such injuries.
Aside from the rule of workers’ compensation
exclusivity, plaintiff cannot recover such damages because he has not alleged a
cause of action for damages based on personal injury.  As discussed above, he alleges causes of
action for FEHA violations, unlawful termination, and whistleblower
retaliation.  Such violations did not
cause his hand injury or the emotional distress deriving from the injury.

judgment application including all documents listed in California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1800(a), no later than August 28, 2024.  
The court hereby sets an order to show
