And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by the Judge addresses the plaintiff's application for default judgment against the defendant. The Judge finds three defects in the application: (1) the plaintiff failed to submit a proposed form of judgment, (2) the plaintiff seeks excessive attorney fees, and (3) the plaintiff seeks excessive interest. The Judge requires the plaintiff to submit a revised application for default judgment with a proposed judgment on Judicial Council Form JUD-100. The Judge also limits the plaintiff's attorney fees to a specified schedule based on the judgment amount, and reduces the requested interest rate from 12% to the usury limit of 10%. The Judge continues the order to show cause re: default judgment to August 23, 2024, and requires the plaintiff to file a revised application no later than August 14, 2024.
