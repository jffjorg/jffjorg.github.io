The judge has set an order to show cause re: entry of default judgment and sanctions, and has given the plaintiff until August 28, 2024 to file a complete default judgment application. The judge has also set an order to show cause re: why the plaintiff should not pay $100 in sanctions under rule 3.110(h). The judge has identified several defects in the plaintiff's application for default judgment, including the failure to request dismissal of defendants Does 1-25, and the insufficient allegations against defendant Mitchell McCray. The judge has also ruled that the superior court does not have jurisdiction over claims covered by the Workers' Compensation Act, and has refused to enter a default judgment against defendant McCray.
