And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Negrete v. Barney, a petition for approval of a minor's compromise. The petition was filed by Wendy Negrete on behalf of Janelle Romero, a 13-year-old who has suffered an injury. The Judge has reviewed the petition and proposed orders, but has identified several issues that need to be addressed before approval can be granted. These issues include the lack of medical records and expenses, incomplete apportionment of the settlement, and incomplete justification of attorney fees. The Judge has therefore continued the hearing to a future date, requiring the parties to address these issues before the case can proceed.
