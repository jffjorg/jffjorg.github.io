- The court will liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.
- The party opposing a motion for summary judgment may not simply rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings but must instead set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.
- To establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive evidence.
