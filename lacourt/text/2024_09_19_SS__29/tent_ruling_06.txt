22STCV25200
Application for Noah W. Drew, Esq. to be Admitted Pro Hac Vice filed by
Plaintiff
Tentative
The application is denied without prejudice.
Background
On August 4, 2022, Sandra Bote (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Doordash, Inc., Kenneth Vallone Taylor, and Does 1
through 50 for negligence arising out of an automobile accident occurring on
December 9, 2020.
On August 29, 2022, Doordash, Inc. filed an
answer. On December 1, 2022, Doordash, Inc. was dismissed.
On September 7, 2022, Plaintiff amended the
complaint to name Postmates, Inc. as Doe 1. Postmates, Inc. filed its answer on
December 5, 2022.
On April 27, 2023, Kenneth Vallone Taylor filed
an answer.
On August 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed the application for Noah W.
Drew, Esq. to be admitted Pro Hac Vice. No opposition has been
filed.
The Court notes a separate application for another attorney was
filed on August 21 and was set for hearing on September 18. 
Legal Standard
Any attorney licensed to practice before the bar of any United
States court or the highest court in any state, and who has been retained to
appear in a particular cause pending a court of this State, but who is not a
licensee of the California State Bar may apply to appear pro hac vice in this
State by submitting his or her written application and mailing notice to all
interested parties, as well as notice and a $50.00 application fee to the State
Bar Association in San Francisco.  (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 9.40
(a), (c), (e).)  An applicant may neither reside nor work in
California and may not perform regular or substantial business, professional,
or other activities in the State.  (Id. at Rule 9.40
(a).) 
 Discussion
The Court has reviewed the application of Noah W. Drew, Esq., to
be admitted pro hac vice and finds that not all of the requirements set forth
in California Rules of Court, rule 9.40, are satisfied.  In
particular:
(1) Mr. Drew states he has
submitted other applications for pro hac vice, but does not provide
“[t]he title of each court and cause in which the applicant has filed an
application to appear as counsel pro hac vice in this state in the preceding
two years, the date of each application, and whether or not it was granted”.
(Cal. Rule of Court, rule 9.40(d)(5).
 (2)  No proof of required $50
fee having been paid; Mr. Drew states has been or will be submitted. (Drew Decl.,
¶ 12.)
Therefore, the Court DENIES without prejudice the application to
be admitted pro hac vice.
Conclusion
Accordingly, the Court DENIES without prejudice the
application of Noah W. Drew, Esq. to be admitted pro hac vice. 
Plaintiff to give notice.
