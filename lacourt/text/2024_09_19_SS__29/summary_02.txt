And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motion to continue trial filed by defendant Kylie Zhou. Zhou seeks a continuance based on the need to complete discovery, but the judge finds that Zhou has not established good cause for the continuance. The judge notes that Zhou has had nine months to complete discovery and has not shown diligence in doing so. Additionally, the judge finds that the voluntary substitution of counsel by Zhou in June 2024 is not good cause for a trial continuance. The judge also notes that the deadline for fact discovery still had more than 60 days left when the motion was filed, and that the potential for Zhou to seek a motion for summary judgment in the future is not, without more, a good cause for a continuance of trial.
