20STCV22291
Defendants’ Motion to Enforce Settlement
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
On June
12, 2020, Israel Nogueda (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against New Legend,
Inc., Robert Michael Connick (collectively “Defendants”), and Does 1 through 20
for motor vehicle negligence arising out of an automobile accident occurring on
June 12, 2020.
 
Defendants
never appeared.  No notice of settlement
was filed.  (The Court notes that the
moving papers reference a cross-complaint, but no cross-complaint was filed.)
 
Plaintiff
failed to appear at the Final Status Conference or Trial.  The Court dismissed the entire action was
dismissed without prejudice on December 10, 2021, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 581, subdivision (b)(3). 
 
On July 25,
2024, Defendants filed this motion to enforce settlement. No opposition has
been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides: 
(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a
writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement. 
(b) For purposes of this section, a
writing is signed by a party if it is signed by any of the following:
(1) The party.
(2) An attorney who represents the party.
(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent
who is authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer's behalf. 
(The Court is aware that the Legislature recently amended section
664.6, but the effective date of the amendment is January 1, 2025.) 
Because of the summary nature of a proceeding to enforce a
settlement agreement under section 664.6, and because settlement of a lawsuit
implicates a substantial right of a litigant, strict compliance with the
statutory requirements is required.  (J.B.B.
Investment Partners, Ltd. v. Fair (2014)
232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985; Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v.
Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37.) 
Before the Legislature amended the statute effective as of January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the litigants
themselves, not their attorneys.  (See Levy v. Superior Court
(1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.)  In any event, however, for a settlement
agreement to be enforceable under section 664.6, all “parties” (as that term is
defined in the statute) must sign, including the party seeking to enforce the
agreement and the party against whom enforcement is sought.  (J.B.B.
Investment Partners, supra, 232 Cal.App.4th at p. 985.) 
If the settlement leaves material terms wanting, or confusing, the
settlement cannot be enforced through the section 664.6 summary
proceeding.  (Compare Terry v. Conlan (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1445
[finding parties never agreed to the means that were material to the
settlement, including what role an independent manager was to play regarding
management of a trust property, and whether the trust should be qualified as a
QTIP, thereby indicating that there was no meeting of the minds as to the
material terms] with Osumi v. Sutton (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1355
[holding trial court’s decision to extend closing date for vendor’s agreement
to repurchase house did not create a material term and was within court’s power
because the closing date had passed by the time the motions came on for hearing
and a new closing date was necessary to grant the relief sought by both
parties].) 
Nonetheless, when the “parties
intend that an agreement be binding, the fact that a more formal agreement must
be prepared and executed does not alter the validity of the agreement.” (Blix St.
Records, Inc. v. Cassidy (2010)
191 CA4th 39, 48.)  
It is possible for parties to have an
enforceable settlement agreement that is not subject to the summary enforcement
proceedings of section 664.6 (including, for example, an
enforceable oral agreement to settle or an agreement that is signed by an
authorized representative who has the power to bind the party but is not listed
in subdivision (b) of the statute).  In
those circumstances, a party seeking to enforce the agreement must proceed
through other means, such as a separate civil action, an amendment to the
answer to add a new affirmative defense, and/or a motion for summary judgment,
rather than through the summary procedures of section 664.6.  (See generally Weddington Productions v.
Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 809 [“Section 664.6 was enacted to provide
a summary procedure for specifically enforcing a settlement contract without the
need for a new lawsuit.”].)
In ruling on a motion brought under Code of
Civil Procedure section 664.6, the court acts as a trier of fact.  The court may consider any admissible
evidence, including documents, declarations, and oral testimony.  (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. (1994) 23
Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533; 3 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial (2024), ¶¶ 12:977-12:978.6.)
Discussion
Defendants move to enforce a settlement
agreement between the parties. For at least two independent reasons, however,
the Court must deny the motion.
First, the declaration of counsel submitted
as part of the moving papers references, but does not attach, a settlement
agreement.  (See Hughes Decl., Exh. 1.) 
Second, and more fundamentally, Code of Civil
Procedure section 664.6, subdivision (a) provides, in part, that “[i]f requested by the parties, the
court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (a).)  Here, however, no one ever requested that the
Court retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement.  To the contrary, the case was dismissed without
prejudice in December 2021, without any request made by any party to retain
jurisdiction.  In the absence of such a
request made (in strict compliance with the provisions of the statute), after
dismissal the Court lacks jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement.  (Mesa RHF Partners v. City of Los Angeles (2019)
33 Cal.App.5tha 913, 917-918; Sayta v. Chu (2017) 17 Cal.App.5tha 845,
848-850; see also 3 Weil & Brown, supra, ¶ 12:982.)  
The motion is denied. 
Conclusion
The Court DENIES the motion to enforce the
settlement agreement. 
Moving Party is
ORDERED to give notice.
