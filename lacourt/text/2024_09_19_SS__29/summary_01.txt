And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to enforce a settlement agreement between the parties. The main reasons for this decision are that the declaration submitted by the defendants as part of their motion does not attach a copy of the settlement agreement, and that the court lacks jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement because no party requested that the court retain jurisdiction to do so. The court notes that the settlement agreement must be in writing and signed by all parties to be enforceable under California Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, and that the court may consider any admissible evidence, including documents, declarations, and oral testimony, when ruling on a motion brought under this statute. The court also notes that the case was dismissed without prejudice in December 2021, and that the court lacks jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement after a case is dismissed without prejudice.
