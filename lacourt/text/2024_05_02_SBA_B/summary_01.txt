Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the case, which outlines the court's decisions on the demurrer and motion to strike. The demurrer was OVERRULED as to the third cause of action (intentional infliction of emotional distress) and SUSTAINED WITH TWENTY DAYS LEAVE TO AMEND as to the fourth and sixth causes of action (gross negligence and vicarious liability).

The motion to strike was DENIED as to paras. 35, 37 (under first cause of action for assault), 41, 43 (under second cause of action for battery), and 48, 50 (under third cause of action for IIED) and prayer for punitive damages, and GRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND as to 56, 58 (under fourth cause of action for gross negligence).

The judge also noted that the allegations were insufficient as to paras. 48 and 50 under the fourth cause of action for gross negligence, and that punitive damages require proof of oppression, fraud, or malice.
