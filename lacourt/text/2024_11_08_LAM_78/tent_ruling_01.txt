FACTUAL
BACKGROUND 
 
This is a quiet title action.
Plaintiffs Shai Harris, individually and as Trustee of the H McClenon Trust and
ADH Harris Trust, and Jovontay Williams, Trustee of the 800 Ranch California
Trust, allege that they were exposed to a promissory note secured by a deed of
trust fraudulently underwritten by Funding Rush, Inc. Plaintiff seeks to quiet
title on the property located at 1939 Spaulding Ave, Los Angeles, CA
90016. 
 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY¿ 
 
On March 16, 2023, Plaintiff Shai
Harris, Trustee of the H Mcclenon Trust Dated 12/12/2019 and Shai Harris,
Trustee of the ADH Harris Trust Dated 01/14/20 filed their Complaint against
Defendants Funding Rush, Inc., Teresa Gorman Martinez and Ruben Martinez,
trustees of GM Defined Benefit Pension Plan (“Pension Plan”), Asset Default
Management, Inc., Lil Wave Financial, Inc., and Douglas J. Burton as trustees
of the DBRAT Family Dated 01/01/15. 
 
On May 24, 2023, Plaintiffs Shai
Harris, Trustee of the H Mcclenon Trust Dated 12/12/2019 and Shai Harris,
Trustee of the ADH Harris Trust Dated 01/14/20, and Jovontay Williams, Trustee
of the 800 Ranch California Trust Dated 06/14/22 filed the operative First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”). 
 
On April 17, 2024, the Court sustained
the Pension Plan’s (defendants Teresa Martinez and Ruben Martinez) demurrer to
the operative FAC without leave to amend. The Court dismissed the Pension Plan
with prejudice. 
 
On May 29, 2024, the Court entered
judgment in favor of the Pension Plan. 
 
On July 31, 2024, the Pension Plan
filed its Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, seeking $13,959.00 against Plaintiff Shai
Harris, Trustee of the H Mcclenon Trust Dated 12/12/2019 and Shai Harris,
Trustee of the ADH Harris Trust Dated 01/14/20 (“Plaintiff Trusts”). The motion
is based on a written contract containing an attorneys’ fees provision and
Civil Code section 1717, Code of Civil Procedure sections 1021, and
1033.5(a)(10)(A).  
 
As of November 5, 2024, the motion is
unopposed. 
 
 
DISCUSSION¿ 
 
                         
I.Motion
for Attorneys’ Fees 
 
Civil
Code section 1717 provides as follows: 
 
(a)  In any action
on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney's fees
and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded ... to
the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party
prevailing on the contract ... shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees
in addition to other costs ... Reasonable attorneys' fees shall be fixed by the
Court, and shall be an element of the costs of suit. 
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 1021 provides as follows: 
 
Except as
attorney's fees are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode
of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement,
express or implied, of the parties; but parties to action or proceedings are
entitled to their costs, as hereinafter provided. 
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 1033.5 provides as follows: 
 
(a) The
following items are allowable as costs under Section 1032: ... (10) attorney
fees, when authorized by any of the following: (A) Contract....
 
Here, the Pension Plan
requests that this Court award it $13,959.00 in attorneys' fees as the
prevailing party, pursuant to the attorneys' fees provisions in the Promissory
Note Secured by Deed of Trust (“Note”), for the successful defense of this
action, along with fees incurred for preparing this motion. (Declaration of
David M. Liu ("Liu Deel."), ¶¶ 4-7; and Ex.
A.) The $13,959.00 sought is based on $9,534.00 in attorney's fees incurred
through entry of judgment, plus $4,425.00 for attorney's fees and costs
incurred to file the instant motion. (Liu Deel., ¶¶ 23-26.)
 
There
is no dispute that the Pension Plan is the prevailing party for purposes of
Civil Code section 1717 and is entitled to attorneys’ fees as part of the May
29, 2024 Judgment.[1]
Specifically, the Court entered judgment in favor of the Pension Plan and
against the Plaintiff Trusts, stating that the Pension Plan “prevailed on all
causes of action asserted against them by [the Plaintiff Trusts] in this
action.” Further, there is no dispute that the Note contains an attorneys’ fees
provision. (Liu Decl., ¶ 15; Ex. A.) Page one of the Note
provides as follows: “If this Note is not paid when due, the Borrower(s)
promise to pay, in addition to the principal and interest due under this Note,
all costs of collection and any reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the
Beneficiary thereof on account of such collection, whether or not suit is filed
hereon.” (Ibid.) Therefore, attorneys’ fees are appropriate in this case
for the Pension Plan. 
 
The
total amount sought by this motion is $13,959.00. (Liu Decl., ¶ 26.)
This is based on $9,534.00, the amount of attorney’s fees already incurred for
the defense of this action, $4,365.00, the amount of attorneys’ fees in
connection with this motion (5 hours to prepare this motion, 3 hours to review
any opposition and prepare a reply brief, and 1 hour preparing for and
attending the hearing on this motion, all at the hourly rate of $485.00), and the
$60.00 filing fee. (Liu Decl., ¶¶ 23-26.)
 
The
Court’s review of the Liu Declaration, its description of the attorneys’ years
of experience, work history, and justification of their respectively hourly
rates leads to the conclusion that such rates are reasonable. (Liu Decl., ¶¶
11-23.) The Court also finds that the Pension Plan has provided sufficient
evidence to support the work that was performed as a copy of a summary of the
$9,534.00 is attached to the Liu Declaration. (Liu Decl., ¶ 16; Ex. D.) The Liu
Declaration is sufficient to support the motion. (Syers Properties III, Inc.
v. Rankin (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 698-699.)
Plaintiff
Trusts do not challenge the requested rates nor the work performed because
there is no opposition to this motion. However, because there is no opposition
and no reply, the Court declines to award the 3 hours that counsel anticipated
to be incurred. (Liu Decl., ¶ 24.)
 
Accordingly,
the motion is GRANTED in the total amount of $12,504.00, representing
$9,534.00 for defending this action, $2,910.00 for preparing this motion and
attending the hearing, and $60.00 for the filing fee. 
 
Moving
Party to give notice.
