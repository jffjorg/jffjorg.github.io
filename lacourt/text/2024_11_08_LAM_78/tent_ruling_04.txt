FACTUAL BACKGROUND   
 
Plaintiff Anthony J. Sparano (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
defendants Casey's Cars, Inc. (“Casey’s Cars”), Woodside Credit, LLC
(“Woodside”), Hudson Insurance Company (“Hudson Insurance”), Denali State Bank
(“Denali”) and Does 1 through 75 pertaining to the purchase of a 2007 Porsche
911 Carrera. The complaint alleges that Plaintiff found the vehicle advertised
by Casey’s Cars on Car Gurus, and after being told there were no problems with
the vehicle, Plaintiff gave Casey’s Cars a $500 deposit to reserve the vehicle
on February 16, 2024. (Compl. ¶¶ 12-14.) Plaintiff and Woodside signed a Loan
Agreement regarding the purchase of the vehicle. (Id. ¶¶ 15-16.) After
Plaintiff and Casey’s Cars signed the contract for the purchase of the vehicle,
Plaintiff found significant issues with the vehicle. (Id. ¶¶ 20-23.)
Plaintiff alleges that Casey’s Car noticed all these problems when it performed
a safety inspection and withheld telling Plaintiff about the problems such that
Plaintiff would not have purchased the vehicle had he known of its true
condition. (Id. ¶¶ 26-27.) Woodside transferred the Loan Agreement to
Denali. (Id. ¶ 28.)

DISCUSSION 
 
                         
I.         
MOTION
TO COMPEL ARBITRATION
 
Defendant Casey’s Cars, Inc. moves to compel arbitration pursuant
to an arbitration provision (the “Arbitration Agreement”) in the Retail
Installment Sale Contact – Simple Finance Charge (the “Sales Contract”) that
Plaintiff signed when he purchased the Subject Vehicle. Defendant also moves to
stay the action pending arbitration. 
 
California law reflects a strong public policy
in favor of arbitration as a relatively quick and inexpensive method for
resolving disputes. To further that policy, California Code of Civil
Procedure section 1281.2 requires a trial court to enforce a written
arbitration agreement unless one of three limited exceptions
applies. Those statutory exceptions arise where (1) a party waives the
right to arbitration; (2) grounds exist for revoking the arbitration agreement;
and (3) pending litigation with a third party creates the possibility of
conflicting rulings on common factual or legal issues.” (Acquire II,
Ltd. v. Colton Real Estate Group (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 959, 967 [citations
omitted]; Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.) 
In deciding a motion to compel arbitration,
trial courts must decide first whether an enforceable arbitration agreement
exists between the parties, and then determine the second gateway issue whether
the claims are covered within the scope of the agreement. (Omar v.
Ralphs Grocery Co. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 955, 961.) The party seeking
arbitration has the “burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration
agreement by a preponderance of the evidence, while a party opposing the
petition bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence any
fact necessary to its defense.” (Ruiz v. Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc.
(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 836, 842.) The trial court “sits as the trier of fact,
weighing all the affidavits, declarations, and other documentary evidence, and
any oral testimony the court may receive at its discretion, to reach a final
determination.” (Id.) General principles of contract law govern
whether parties have entered a binding agreement to arbitrate. (Pinnacle
Museum Tower Assn. v. Pinnacle Market Development (US), LLC (2012) 55
Cal.4th 223, 236; see also Winter v. Window Fashions Professions, Inc.
(2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 943, 947.) 
Here, Plaintiff questions neither the existence
nor the validity of the Arbitration Agreement, so the Court need not consider that
matter further. 
Plaintiff argues
about the scope of arbitration discovery and selection of an arbitrator. These
matters are outside the scope of the instant motion. 
Accordingly, Casey’s
Cars, Inc.’s Motion to Compel Arbitration is GRANTED.
If a court has ordered arbitration of a
controversy which is pending before a court, upon motion of a party to such
action or proceeding, the court shall stay the action or proceeding until an
arbitration occurs in accordance with the order to arbitrate or until such earlier
time as the court specifies. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.4.) If the issue which is
the controversy subject to arbitration is severable, the stay may be with
respect to that issue only. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.4.)
 
The causes of action in both cross-complaints are not severable
because they are about indemnification and fault. Thus, the entire action is
stayed pending arbitration.
