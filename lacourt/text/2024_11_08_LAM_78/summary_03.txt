And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Skanska USA Building Inc.'s motion to stay the action pending arbitration. The motion was filed in response to McKinley Equipment Corporation's lawsuit against Skanska, CHA Hollywood Medical Center, L.P., and others. The lawsuit alleges breach of contract, foreclosure of mechanic's lien, quantum meruit, recovery on contractor's license bonds, and recovery on payment bond.

The judge found that the motion to stay was granted because the Subcontract between McKinley and Skanska requires McKinley to stay any independent litigation related to the construction of the Acute Care Services Replacement Hospital Building, which is the subject of the Arbitration proceeding. The judge also found that staying the action was in the interest of judicial economy and efficiency, as seven of the related cases are already stayed pending the Arbitration, and the claims that Skanska is prosecuting and that will be decided in the Arbitration are the same claims that McKinley is raising in this action.

The judge denied McKinley's opposition to the motion, finding that McKinley failed to adequately address why it should not be bound by Section 13.4.2 of the Subcontract, which requires McKinley to stay owner-related disputes upon notice of Skanska's intent to prosecute McKinley's claims. The judge also found that McKinley's arguments that Section 13.4.2 is inapplicable because no work has been performed and the equipment has not been installed, and that Skanska waived its right to stay by waiting over a year after the lawsuit was filed to bring its motion, were unpersuasive.
