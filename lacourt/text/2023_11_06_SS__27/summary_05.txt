And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Reina I. Contreras vs. 6851 Sepulveda Blvd., Inc., et al. The case involves a dispute over a motion to be relieved as counsel, filed by Thomas H. Citron, who represents the defendants. Citron claims that there has been a breakdown in communication with his clients and that it is impossible for him to effectively represent them. However, the defendants' president, Ritesh Desai, denies this claim and states that they are still communicating with Citron.

The Judge finds that the defendants have not made a showing of prejudice to prevent Citron from withdrawing as counsel. However, the Judge also finds that the motion is procedurally deficient because it does not set forth all hearing dates scheduled in the action, including the date of the Final Status Conference.

As a result, the Judge denies the motion to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. Citron is ordered to give notice to the parties, and any party who intends to submit on the tentative must send an email to the Court. The Judge may adopt the tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar if no submissions are received.
