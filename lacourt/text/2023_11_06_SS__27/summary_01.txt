And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment filed by Restaurant Depot, LLC against plaintiff Ena Mejia. Mejia was injured when a box fell off a shopping cart at a Restaurant Depot store in Van Nuys. She claims that Restaurant Depot was negligent in creating a hazardous condition by allowing the store to be overcrowded and failing to correct the condition. Restaurant Depot argues that it did not create the hazardous condition and did not have actual or constructive knowledge of it before the incident. The court finds that Restaurant Depot has met its burden of showing the absence of a triable issue of material fact on the issues of duty, breach, and causation. Mejia's evidence is insufficient to create a triable issue of fact, and the court grants Restaurant Depot's motion for summary judgment.
