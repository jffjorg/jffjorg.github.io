MOVING PARTY: Thomas H. Citron (“Citron”) 
RESPONDING PARTIES: Defendants 6851 Sepulveda Blvd., Inc.,
Doe Defendant Anza Management Company, and Doe Defendant J.K. Residential

I.           
INTRODUCTION
On
June 7, 2022, Plaintiff Reina I. Contreras (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint
against Defendants 6851 Sepulveda Blvd. Inc. and Does 1 to 20, alleging causes
of action for: (1) premises liability; and (2) general negligence. The
complaint arises from Plaintiff allegedly being struck on the head by a failing
piece of ceiling in her residence. 
On
August 8, 2022, Plaintiff filed an Amendment to Complaint which substituted J.K.
Residential Services, Inc. for Doe 1. On August 8, 2022, Plaintiff filed an
Amendment to Complaint which substituted Anza Management Company for Doe 2. 
On
January 26, 2023, Thomas H. Citron (“Citron”) filed substitution of attorney
forms indicating that he was the new legal representative for Defendants. 
On
September 14, 2023, Citron filed and served a motion to be relieved as counsel for
6851 Sepulveda Blvd., Inc. and JK Properties, Inc. (the “Motion”). 
On
September 21, 2023, the parties entered into a stipulation to continue trial
from December 5, 2023, to June 5, 2024, and to continue the Final Status
Conference (“FSC”) from November 21, 2023, to May 23, 2024. 
On
October 24, 2023, Defendants 6851 Sepulveda Blvd., Inc., Anza Management
Company, and J.K. Residential Services, Inc. (“JKRS”) (collectively, “Defendants”)
filed an opposition to the Motion and contend that: (1) there is no breakdown
in communication between attorney and clients; and (2) Defendants will suffer
prejudice if defense counsel withdraws. On October 27, 2023, Citron filed a
reply brief. 
The
FSC in this action is scheduled for May 23, 2024. Non-jury trial in this action
is scheduled for June 5, 2024. 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
The court may order that an attorney be
changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment or final
determination upon request by either client or attorney and after notice from
one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(2).) “The determination whether to
grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion
of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66
Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 An application to be relieved as
counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and
Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1362(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(e)). The proposed order must specify all hearing dates scheduled in
the action or proceeding, including the date of trial, if known.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 Further, the requisite forms must
be served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the
case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).)  The court may delay the
effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy
of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).)  A motion to withdraw will not be granted
where withdrawal would prejudice the client. 
(Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994),
21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
III.       
DISCUSSION
Declarations of Citron 
In support of the Motion, Citron
declares that there has been a complete breakdown of communications and it is
impossible for him to effectively represent Defendants in this action at trial.

In connection with the reply brief,
Citron states that Defendants have blocked the receipt of any e-mails. (Citron
Reply Decl., ¶ 4.) Defendants have also failed and refused to comply with the
terms of their agreement to retain defense counsel by failing to pay attorney’s
fees and the costs of experts they had agreed to retain. (Id., ¶ 5.)
Declaration in Opposition to the Motion

In opposition to the motion, the
President of JKRS, Ritesh Desai (“Desai”) declares that JKRS has fully
disclosed the facts of this case and has fully cooperated with Citron. (Desai
Decl., ¶ 3.) Desai declares that they are not aware of any communication
problems between JKRS and Citron and that Citron’s claim of lack of
communication is exaggerated. (Id., ¶¶ 7-8.) JKRS still communicates
with Citron. (Id., ¶ 9.) JKRS has made attempts to locate alternative
counsel but has been unsuccessful. (Id., ¶ 5.) Desai declares that they
are searching for attorneys who are highly experienced in the issues raised in
the complaint to help them adequately prepare the defense of this matter. (Id.,
¶ 6.) 
 
Analysis 
The Court finds that Defendants have
not made a showing of prejudice to prevent Citron from withdrawing as counsel.
The declaration of Desai is only as to JKRS and does not address Defendant 6851
Sepulveda Blvd., Inc. Moreover, the declaration of Desai does not state how
Defendants will be prejudiced if the Motion is granted. Trial is more than six
months away. 
Irrespective of the issues between
counsel and Defendants, however, the Court finds that the Motion is
procedurally deficient. While the Court recognizes that the trial date was
continued pursuant to a stipulation after Citron filed the Motion, neither the
MC-052 nor MC-053 Forms set forth the FSC date. A motion to be relieved as
counsel must set forth all hearing dates scheduled in an action. California
Rule of Court 3.1362(e). 
Moreover, according to the MC-051 and
MC-052 Forms, in addition to being relieved as counsel for Defendant 6851
Sepulveda Blvd., Inc., Citron seeks to be relieved as counsel for “JK
Properties, Inc.;” based on the court file, JK Properties, Inc. is not a
defendant in this action.  
Based on these procedural defects, the
Court DENIES Citron’s motion to be relieved as counsel WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
IV.        
CONCLUSION
The Motion is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

Citron is ordered to give notice.
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SSCDEPT27@lacourt.org indicating
intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided
on the court website at www.lacourt.org. 
Please be advised that if you submit on the tentative and elect not to
appear at the hearing, the opposing party may nevertheless appear at the
hearing and argue the matter.  Unless you
receive a submission from all other parties in the matter, you should assume
that others might appear at the hearing to argue.  If the Court does not receive emails from the
parties indicating submission on this tentative ruling and there are no
appearances at the hearing, the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the
tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
