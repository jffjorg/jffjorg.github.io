[1] The correct name is apparently
Restaurant Depot, LLC, as that is the name under which Restaurant Depot moves
for summary judgment.


[2] While Plaintiff disputes SSUMF 11, the Court notes
that Plaintiff’s separate statement fails to comply with the requirements of
subdivision (f)(2) of Rule 3.1350 of the California Rules of Court, which
provides that opposing separate statements “must include reference to the
exhibit, title, page, and line numbers” of the evidenced cited in support
thereof. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1350, subd. (f)(2).) Plaintiff’s
responses to Restaurant Depot’s proffered statements of material fact do not
cite to any exhibits, titles, pages, or line numbers of any specific items of
evidence.
In any event, Plaintiff
concedes she first saw the shopping cart on her way to the cashier, which is
another way of saying Plaintiff does not know how long the allegedly hazardous
condition existed before the incident occurred. Plaintiff’s attempt to dispute
this material fact is also directly undermined by Plaintiff not disputing
Undisputed Material Fact Number 12, which directly concedes this issue. (SSUMF
12.)  Thus, in the Court’s view SSUMF 11 is
without dispute.
