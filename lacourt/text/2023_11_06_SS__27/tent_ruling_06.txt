INTRODUCTION
On July 22, 2022, Plaintiff Nathan Strauss
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants WEERTS REAL ESTATE, INC., a
corporation; KIN’WA YUNG, individually and as trustee on behalf of Yung Family
Trust; JANET RHEE, individually and as trustee on behalf of Yung Family Trust;
KIN’KWOK YUNG, individually and as trustee on behalf of Yung Family Trust; and
DOES 1 to 50, Inclusive, alleging causes of action for (1) general negligence
and (2) premises liability. 
On September 9, 2023, Defendants Kin Wa Yung
and Janet Rhee, individually and as trustees for the Yung Family Trust, Kin
Kwok Yung, and Weerts Real Estate, Inc. (collectively “Defendants”) filed four
motions to compel Plaintiff’s verified responses to Requests for Admission, Set
One; Form Interrogatories, Set One; Production of Documents, Set One; and
Special Interrogatories, Set One.  Each
motion requests sanctions in the amount of $500.46 for a total of
$2,001.84.   
The Court granted Plaintiff’s counsel Bradley
S. Wallace and the Wallace Firm, PC’s motion to be relieved as counsel for
Plaintiff on October 6, 2023, effective as of the time of service of notice,
which was October 30, 2023. 
No opposition or reply has been filed in the
instant motions.
II.               
LEGAL STANDARD
a.     
Compelling
Initial Discovery 
Where a party fails to serve timely responses
to discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300; Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)¿¿ A party that
fails to serve timely responses waives any objections to the request, including
ones based on privilege or the protection of attorney work product.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd. (a).)¿ Unlike a motion to compel
further responses, a motion to compel responses is not subject to a
45-day time limit and the propounding party has no meet and confer
obligations.¿ (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148
Cal.App.4th at p. 404.) If a propounding party moves for and obtains a court
order compelling a response, the court shall impose monetary sanctions against
the party failing to timely respond to interrogatories and demands for
inspection unless that party acted with substantial justification or the
sanction would otherwise be unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.010, 2030.290,
2031.300, 2033.28;¿Sinaiko¿Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra,
148 Cal.App.4th at 404.)¿¿
b.     
Deeming
Admissions Admitted
Where a party fails to timely respond to a
request for admission, the propounding party may move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)¿ The
party who failed to respond waives any objections to the demand, unless the
court grants them relief from the waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has
subsequently served a substantially compliant response, and (2) that the
party’s failure to respond was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)¿ The court shall
grant a motion to deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that
the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served,
before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for
admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)¿ 
III.            
DISCUSSION
As a preliminary matter, it is noted that, even
though four separate motions were filed, they are all identical in so far as
they rely on the same legal arguments and exhibits. Thus, for citing purposes,
the Court shall reference just one motion.  
Defendants contend they served Plaintiff with
Requests for Admission, Form Interrogatories, Production of Documents, and
Special Interrogatories on January 13, 2023. 
(Motions, Exh. A.)  Defendants
provided Plaintiff with multiple extensions, and Plaintiff finally served
unverified responses on May 10, 2023.  (Motion,
Asel. Decl. ¶10; Exh. B.)  The responses
provided that a verification was to follow.  
When Plaintiff failed to provide verified responses, defense counsel
sent plaintiff’s counsel a meet and confer letter on June 8, 2023, requesting
verified responses by June 16, 2023. 
(Motion, Asel Decl. ¶ 11; Exh. C.) Defense counsel sent another meet and
confer letter on June 25, 2023, requesting verified responses by August 7,
2023.  To date, Plaintiff has failed to
provide verified responses. (Motion, Asel Decl. ¶ 12; Exh. D.) 
There is no evidence before the Court that
Plaintiff served verified responses to Defendants’ discovery demands.  While Plaintiff has responded, the failure to
provide verified responses when required to do so is deemed to be no
response at all.  (Zorro Inv. Co. v.
Great Pacific Securities Corp. (1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 907, 914.)
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendants’
motions to compel plaintiff’s verified responses to requests for admission, set
one; form interrogatories; set one; requests for production of documents, set
one; and special interrogatories, set one. 

Defendants also request sanctions in the amount
of $500.46 for each motion in the total amount of $2,001.84 against Plaintiff
and the Wallace Firm, which was his attorneys of record at the time discovery
was due.  The court finds that sanctions
are warranted as Plaintiff failed to comply with his discovery obligations and
plaintiff’s counsel failed to provide verified responses to Defendants’
discovery requests. 
As the Motions were not complex and remain
unopposed and no reply has been filed, the Court awards Defendants’ sanctions
in the total reduced amount of $1200 (approximately 6 hours in preparing the
motions at $160.17 per hour; four filing fees, each for $60.00.) jointly  against Plaintiff Nathan Strauss and the
Wallace Firm. 
IV.            
CONCLUSION
Defendants’ Motions to Compel Responses to (1)
Request for Admissions, Set One; (2) Form Interrogatories, Set One; (3)
Requests for Production, Set One; and (4) Special Interrogatories, Set One are
GRANTED. 
Plaintiff Nathan Strauss is ordered to provide
verified responses without objections.  
The Court also GRANTS Defendants’ requests for
sanctions in the reduced total amount of $1200 against Plaintiff Nathan Strauss
and the Wallace Firm.
