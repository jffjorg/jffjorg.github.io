And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a summary judgment motion by Restaurant Depot, LLC, and has reviewed the evidence presented by both parties. The judge notes that the plaintiff's separate statement does not comply with the requirements of California Rule of Court 3.1350, subdivision (f)(2), and therefore lacks sufficient evidence to support its disputes. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's attempts to dispute certain material facts are undermined by the plaintiff's own concessions and lack of evidence. As a result, the judge is inclined to grant Restaurant Depot's motion for summary judgment.
