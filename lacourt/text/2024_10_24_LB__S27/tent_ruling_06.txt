1.     Motions
to Compel Further
a.    
Meet and Confer 
            On July 8,
2024, the parties met and conferred pursuant to California Code of Civil
Procedure Section 2016.040. (Smith Decl. ¶ 16.)
b.    
Legal Standard
 
            Compel
Interrogatories and Requests for Production – Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2030.300 &
2031.310 provide for a party to bring a motion to compel further responses to
interrogatories and requests for production where the responding party provides
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive responses, or the objections are too general
or without merit. The propounding party must submit a declaration under Code of
Civ. Proc. §2016.040 stating facts demonstrating a good faith and reasonable
effort to informally resolve each issue raised by the motion. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§2030.300, subd. (b).) The motions must be brought within 45 days of service of
the responses or supplemental responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd.
(c) & 2031.310, subd. (c).) Sanctions are mandatory against the party or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further unless
the party acted with substantial justification or the circumstances make
imposition of sanctions unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (d) &
2031.310, subd. (h).)     
            California
Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.310(a) provides, in relevant part that a party
“may move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the
demanding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) A statement of
compliance with the demand is incomplete. (2) A representation of inability to
comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. (3) An objection in the response
is without merit or too general.” 
            California
Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.310 (b)(1) requires a party seeking to compel
production to “set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the inspection demand.” (Accord, Kirkland v.
Superior Ct., 95 Cal. App. 4th 92, 98 (2002).) “Good cause” has been
liberally construed by the courts when considering a request for production of
documents. Good cause typically may be shown merely upon a showing of
relevance. (See Associated Brewers Distributing Co. v. Superior Ct., 65
Cal. 2d 583, 586 (1967); TBG Insurance Services Corp. v. Superior Ct.,
96 Cal. App. 4th 443, 448 (2002).) 
Further, Code of Civil Procedure
section 2033.280 provides, in relevant part:
            If
a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the following rules apply: 
            (a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). . .  (b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). 
(c) The court shall make this
order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have
been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response
to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both,
whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated
this motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a), (b), (c).) 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.250, a responding party must
serve responses to a propounding party’s request for admission within thirty
(30) days of service.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250, subd. (a).) 
c.    
Merits
            Plaintiff
Hannah Lanae Navarro moves for an Order compelling Defendant to provide further
responses to the four discovery requests because the responses were inadequate,
incomplete, and evasive. (Not. at p.1.)
            Defendant
concedes that substantive responses were required for the discovery at issue.
(Opposition p. 2.) On July 22, 2024, Acker & Whipple served Mr. Lim’s
verified responses to the subject discovery requests. (Smith Decl. ¶¶ 19,21.)
            Thus, the
only dispute remaining is whether sanctions are warranted. 
d.    
Sanctions
Plaintiff seeks sanctions in the
amount of $2,100.00 for each discovery motion for a total of $8,400.00.
Defendant argues that sanctions are not warranted because Acker & Whipple
acted with substantial justification in serving objections on Mr. Lim’s behalf
for preservation purposes because counsel had a conflict. (Opposition pp.4-5.)
Nevertheless, the Court finds sanctions are warranted in a reduced amount
against Defendant’s counsel Acker & Whipple because the amount sought is
excessive due to the simplicity of the motions. 
Here, Acker & Whipple was
assigned as defense counsel in relation to Hannah Navarro, et al. v. Jose
Miguel Lim IV, et al. (the “Navarro Action”). (Smith Decl. ¶ 4.) In early
June 2024, Acker & Whipple discovered that Mr. Lim had filed his own
personal injury action against various government entities, Jose Miguel Lim
IV v. City of Carson, et al., case no. 23CMCV01137 (the “Lim Action”), and
that one of the named defendants to the Lim Action, the City of Los Angeles, is
a client of Acker & Whipple, which created a conflict fundamentally
precluding Acker & Whipple from assisting Mr. Lim with the preparation of
his responses because its two existing clients had adverse interests in
relation to the subject incident. (Smith Decl. ¶ 6.) Acker & Whipple
requested from defendants’ insurance carrier that new defense counsel be
assigned and informed Mr. Taheripour about these developments on June 17, 2024,
and then again on June 20, 2024, when Michael Schonbuch of Schonbuch Hallissy
LLP was assigned as the new defense counsel. (Smith Decl. ¶ 7.) Notably, no
substitution of attorney was ever filed with the Court. Shortly thereafter, it
was discovered that Schonbuch Hallissy LLP also had a conflict relative to the
Lim Action as named defendant California Department of Transportation
(“CalTrans”) was one of its clients. (Smith Decl. ¶ 8.)
On June 27, 2024, Acker &
Whipple sent an email to Plaintiff’s Counsel advising him of the Lim action and
how this lawsuit had created conflicts for both Acker & Whipple and
Schonbuch Hallissy LLP. (Smith Decl. ¶ 10.) The firm also informed Plaintiff’s
Counsel of Mr. Bloeser’s representation that the City of Los Angeles had been
dismissed from the Lim Action, which would clear the conflict for Acker &
Whipple, and allow for it to resume the handling of the defense in the Navarro
Action. (Smith Decl. ¶ 10.)
Nevertheless, it is unclear how
Acker & Whipple was unaware of the conflict between clients when Mr. Lim
filed the Lim Action on July 24, 2023, before Acker & Whipple’s
representation of Mr. Lim in the Navarro Action. Moreover, Acker & Whipple
remained as Defendant’s counsel of record. Thus, sanctions are warranted
against Defendant’s counsel, Acker & Whipple. 
However, sanctions are reduced to
$4,800.00 for 3.5 hours total drafting and preparing the motions, reply and 0.5
hour attending the hearing at a rate of $300.00 because the four motions are
nearly identical and simple. 
 
2.     Conclusion
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s
discovery motions compelling Defendant’s further response as MOOT. 
Sanctions are granted in the amount
of $4,800.00 against Defendants counsel only. Acker & Whipple is ordered to
pay Plaintiff $4,800.00 within 30 days of this order. 
The Court further notes that there
are no future hearing dates scheduled in this case.  The Court sets a Case
Management Conference and Trial Setting Conference for December 18, 2024.
Moving Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.
