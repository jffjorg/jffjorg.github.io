And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a lawsuit filed by Hannah Lanae Navarro and Ismael Navarro against Jose Miguel Lim Iv. The plaintiffs are seeking to compel further responses to discovery requests and are asking the court to impose sanctions on the defendant's counsel, Acker & Whipple. The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motions to compel further responses as moot, as the defendant's counsel has already provided responses to the discovery requests. The judge has granted sanctions against the defendant's counsel in the amount of $4,800.00, which is reduced from the amount sought by the plaintiffs due to the simplicity of the motions. The judge has also ordered the defendant's counsel to pay this amount to the plaintiffs within 30 days. The next hearing date in the case is set for December 18, 2024.
