 Case Number:  24LBCV00066    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2024    Dept:  S27 1.     Background
Facts
On January 11, 2024, Plaintiff
Yolanda Haskell (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against American Honda Motor
Company, Inc. (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 10. This action is a lemon law case
involving alleged electrical and transmission defects with Plaintiff’s 2016
Honda CR-V. The Complaint seeks relief for Defendant’s failure to repair or
repurchase, failure to provide its repair facility with sufficient literature
to complete repairs, and breach of implied warranty of merchantability, among
other things. 
On March 15, 2024, Plaintiff
propounded Requests for Production of Documents, Set One (“RFP (1)”) on
Defendant. (Theophil Decl., ¶ 23, Exh. 6.)
On May 28, 2024, Defendant served
unverified responses to Plaintiff’s RFP (1). (Theophil Decl., ¶ 25, Exh. 7.) On
May 30, Defendant serves verification for its Responses to Plaintiff’s RFP (1).
(Theophil Decl., ¶ 26, Exh. 8.) 
On July 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed
this Motion to Compel Further Responses to Plaintiff RFP (1) (the “Motion”) and
the separate statement. 
On September 13, 2024, Defendant
filed the opposition and opposition to the separate statement.
On September 19, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the reply. 
On September 26, 2024, the Court
continued the hearing on the Motion to October 24, 2024. The continuance was
given to allow Counsel to meet and confer, with this Court’s prior rulings on
discovery motions concerning the instant Defendant in mind. The required joint
statement, briefs, and declarations were due at least seven court days prior to
today’s hearing, on October 15.
On October 18, 2024, the parties
filed an untimely joint statement of discovery in dispute.
2.     Legal
Standard
CCP Section 2031.310 allows a party
who has requested production of documents and received unsatisfactory responses
to move for an order compelling further responses. A motion under this section
must (1) set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery
sought by the demand and (2) be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b).) CRC Rule
3.1345 requires the moving party to file a separate statement showing good
cause.  
To establish good cause, the burden
is on the moving party to show: (1) relevance to the subject matter and (2)
specific facts justifying discovery. (Glenfed Develop. Corp. v. Sup. Ct.
(National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Penn.) (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th
1113, 1117; see also Kirkland v. Sup. Ct. (Guess?, Inc.) (2002) 95
Cal.App.4th 92, 98.)
3.     Motion
to Compel Further Responses 
The parties met and conferred via
telephone and email regarding the Motion to Compel. (Theophil Decl., ¶ 31-37,
Exhs. 9-14; Joint Statement, Exh. A.) As a result, Plaintiff agreed to withdraw
RFP Nos. 3, 19, 20, 82, 83, 86, 88, 90, 103, 106, 107, 125, 126, 130, and 131.
Plaintiff has also agreed to limit the documents she seeks to 2016 Honda CR-V
vehicles. The parties address RFP Nos. 1, 2, 7, 9, 14-18, 27, 28, 37, 38, 41,
42, 45, 46, 51, 52, 53, 54, 67-72, 80, 81, 109, 113, 114, 119, 120, 132, and
133 in the joint statement. 
In the joint statement, Defendant
has agreed to supplement its response to RFP Nos. 1, 2, 7, 9, 14, 15, 17, 18,
27, 28, 37, 38, 68, 132, and 133. The remaining requests are in dispute.
Requests Regarding Transmission Defects – RFP Nos. 16, 42,
46, 70, 81, 114, 119, 120
Such requests seek information
relating to the defined “TRANSMISSION DEFECT(S)” and problems with the
vehicle’s “CVT transmission.” Defendant objects to these requests to the extent
they seek information regarding transmission defects that were not of concern
when Plaintiff presented the subject vehicle for repair. Defendant has
requested that Plaintiff strike the “TRANSMISSION DEFECT(S)” definition and
requests pertaining to transmission because Plaintiff presented the vehicle for
alleged transmission defects over one year and four months after the powertrain
warranty expiration date and declined suggested repairs (Joint Statement, Exh.
A.) As a compromise, Defendant asked that Plaintiff strike certain portions of
the transmission defect definition to only include those issues experienced
during that visit. (Ibid.) According to the repaid orders, the subject
vehicle was presented only for issues related to hesitation, delayed
acceleration, shuddering, or juddering. Plaintiff has declined to remove or
strike the transmission defect definition and has only agreed to strike the
portion stating “as well as, any other similar concerns identified in the
repair history for the subject vehicle.” (Ibid.)
The Court finds that Plaintiff
should make Defendant’s requested revisions to the transmission defects
definition and to the requests involving transmission issues. The Court finds
that modifying the transmission definition to include only those defects
Plaintiff experienced and presented at said visit will provide relevant
information needed for Plaintiff’s case. 
The Court GRANTS, in part, the
Motion to Compel RFP Nos. 16, 42, 46, 70, 81, 114, and 120 to the extent
Plaintiff modifies the transmission defects definition and the CVT transmission-related
requests. 
 
Requests Regarding Electrical Defects – RFP Nos. 41, 45,
69, 80, 113, 119
Such requests seek information
relating to the defined “ELECTRICAL DEFECT(S)” and problems with the vehicle’s “electrical
architecture.” Defendant argues that the requests should limit the definition
of “ELECTRICAL DEFECT(s)” and other vague terms in these RFPs to those concerns
for which the vehicle was presented for repair. Plaintiff has declined to
modify the definitions.
The Court finds Plaintiff should
make Defendant’s requested revisions as to the electrical defects definition
and to the appropriate requests. The Court finds that modifying the electrical
defects definition to include only those defects Plaintiff originally presented
for repair will provide relevant information needed for Plaintiff’s case.
The Court GRANTS, in part, the
Motion to Compel RFP Nos. 41, 45, 69, 80, 113, and 119 to the extent
Plaintiff modifies the electrical defects definition and the electrical
architecture-related requests.
Requests Relating to Other/Similar Vehicles – RFP Nos.
51, 52, 53, 54, 67
RFP Nos. 51, 52, 53, and 54 seek
information regarding other Honda CR-V vehicles Defendant repurchased or
replaced after two or more repair attempts for similar electrical and
transmission issues. Request No. 67 requests information in Defendant’s
Analytical Warranty System regarding electrical defects in other Honda CR-V
vehicles with the same electrical architecture as the subject vehicle.
Defendant argues that information about other vehicles experiencing the same or
similar issues is unnecessary to prove Plaintiff’s case. Plaintiff argues such
information is relevant to show that Defendant was on notice of consumer
complaints of similar transmission and electrical defects. Specifically,
Plaintiff argues that discovery beyond the subject vehicle is warranted to show
a manufacturers’ knowledge of the defect that warrants civil penalties under
the Song Beverly Act (SBA) for willfully failing to repurchase a defective
vehicle and also to support Plaintiff’s breach of the express and implied
warranty claims.
The Court finds that the request
seeking information about other vehicles is essential to prove whether
Defendant was on notice about the same or similar electrical and transmission
defects at the time the subject vehicle was sold. The Court agrees with
Plaintiff that such information is relevant for her civil penalties claim under
SBA and for her breach of warranty claims. The Court notes that to the extent
these requests incorporate the definitions of and references to transmission
and electrical defects, the requests should be modified in conformity with the
requests discussed above. 
The Court GRANTS, in part, the
Motion to Compel RFP Nos. 51, 52, 53, 54, and 67 to the extent Plaintiff limits
all definitions of and references to electrical and transmission defects to
those Plaintiff presented for repair. 
Other Requests – RFP Nos. 71, 72, 109
Defendant argues RFP Nos. 71 and 72
are duplicative of RFP Nos. 15 and 16, respectively. The Court finds that RFP
Nos. 71 and 72 are more specific than RFP Nos. 15 and 16—they provide a list of
the types of documents Plaintiff’s seeks. Further, RFP Nos. 71 and 72 refer to
documents prepared by Defendant’s “engineers or suppliers,” whereas RFP Nos. 15
and 16 do not. Thus, the requests are not duplicative. The Court notes that to
the extent these requests incorporate the definitions of and references to
transmission and electrical defects, the requests should be modified in
conformity with the requests discussed above. 
The Court GRANTS, in part, RFP Nos.
71 and 72 to the extent Plaintiff limits all definitions of and references to
electrical and transmission defects to those Plaintiff presented for repair.
Defendant argues RFP No. 109, which
requests the user manual for Defendant’s databases that store information on “warranty
records, customer complaints, field reports, technician line contact, field
service reports, and dealer contacts,” does not seek relevant information for
any claim or defense. Plaintiff argues this RFP seeks information on
Defendant’s Lemon Law, warranty, and recall policies and procedures. The Court
finds RFP No. 109 is irrelevant because it seeks information on how
information is stored and kept as opposed to whether Defendant has
policies and procedures in place. 
The Court DENIES the Motion to
Compel RFP No. 109. 
 
 
4.     Conclusion
The Court GRANTS, in part, the
Motion to Compel RFP Nos. 16, 41, 42, 45, 46, 51, 52, 53, 54, 67, 69, 70, 71,
72, 80, 81, 113, 114, 119, and 120 to the extent Plaintiff limits all
definitions of and references to electrical and transmission defects to those
Plaintiff presented for repair.
The Court DENIES the Motion to
Compel RFP No. 109.
