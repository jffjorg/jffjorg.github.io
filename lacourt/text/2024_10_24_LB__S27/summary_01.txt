And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff's motion to exclude Defendants' expert testimony. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendants unreasonably failed to comply with expert discovery requirements, but the judge found that the Plaintiff failed to timely comply with expert witness disclosure requirements and therefore lacks standing to bring the motion. The judge also found that the Defendants did not unreasonably fail to comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2034.300, as they provided dates for the Plaintiff to depose their expert witnesses and the Plaintiff failed to submit notices for such expert depositions until after the close of discovery. The judge concluded that the Plaintiff's motion was aimed at eliciting an evidentiary sanction that would punish the Defendants, rather than a sanction to obtain the object of discovery they were not able to receive.
