Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Ford Motor Company (Defendant) challenging the sufficiency of the sixth and seventh causes of action in the complaint filed by Davida Wright (Plaintiff). The judge finds that the sixth cause of action seeking injunctive relief and restitution fails to state facts establishing no remedy at law if available. The judge notes that the Song-Beverly Warranty Act does not restrict remedies that are otherwise available, and that the Plaintiff has not pleaded sufficient facts to establish that no other remedies at law exist.

The judge also finds that the seventh cause of action fails to state facts supporting a claim for service contract violations because the Plaintiff has not pleaded facts establishing that Ford Motor Company is the service contractor under the service contract. The judge notes that the service contract was purchased from Echo Park Automative and not from Ford Motor Company.

Based on these findings, the judge sustains the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the Plaintiff will not have the opportunity to refile the complaint with additional information. The judge orders Ford Motor Company to give notice of the ruling.
