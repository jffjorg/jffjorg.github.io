Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Veo's motion for summary judgment or adjudication on the grounds that triable issues of fact remain with regards to whether Veo owed a duty of care to Williams and whether the design of the Veo scooter was defective. The judge found that Veo failed to establish that it did not owe a duty of care to Williams, and that triable issues of fact remain with regards to whether the design of the Veo scooter was defective. The judge also denied Veo's motion with regards to the wrongful death and survival claims, finding that these claims are derivative of the negligence and products liability claims.
