And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees and costs, which totals $42,794.72. This amount includes $35,877.00 in attorney fees incurred, $5,000.00 for work done reviewing the defendant's opposition and preparing a reply brief, and $1,917.72 in costs. The defendant opposed the motion, arguing that some of the fees are unreasonable. The court agrees with the defendant that $1,079 billed for attorney time on July 30, 2024 is not reasonable, as the case had already settled by that date. The court also finds that the anticipated $5,000 for reviewing opposition, preparing a reply brief, and attending a hearing is a bit high. However, the court notes that the plaintiff has revised this figure to $2,200.00, which it finds reasonable. As a result, the court awards the plaintiff $38,915.72 in fees and costs.
