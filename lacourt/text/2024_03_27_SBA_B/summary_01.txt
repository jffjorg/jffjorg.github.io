Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the first, second, and fourth causes of action. The judge has granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the sixth cause of action, with leave to amend.

The judge has found that the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged standing under the first, second, and fourth causes of action. The judge has denied the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to these causes of action because the allegations are not duplicative and the sixth cause of action is statutory and requires specificity in pleading.

The judge has granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the sixth cause of action because the allegations are insufficient to show that the defendant took or retained property for a wrongful use or with the intent to defraud and that the plaintiff was harmed, and that the defendant's conduct was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff's harm. The plaintiff has 20 days to amend the complaint to cure these deficiencies.
