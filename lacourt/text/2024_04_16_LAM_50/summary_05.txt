And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court is considering a special motion to strike a cause of action against the defendant, which is subject to section 425.16 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The plaintiff has alleged that the defendant's actions were taken in furtherance of the defendant's right of petition or free speech under the United States and California Constitutions. The opposition has discussed the defendant's Cross-Complaint, which describes an oral agreement that the defendant's interest in the property was only to be transferred upon death. The Cross-Complaint also alleges that the defendant kicked the plaintiff out of the Banff property when the plaintiff complained about not being on title after paying $230,000 for a one-half interest in the property. The court will determine whether the plaintiff has established a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.
