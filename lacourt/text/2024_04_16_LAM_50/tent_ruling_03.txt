[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
PLAINTIFFS’
  REQUEST FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT 
 



 
Plaintiffs Daniel Acosta (“Acosta”), Salvador Gomez (“Gomez”) Marcos Ochoa (“Ochoa”), and Xiomara
Sanchez (“Sanchez”), (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)
request entry of default judgment against Defendants Libra Hollywood, LLC and
John Greenwood (jointly, “Defendants”). Plaintiffs
seek judgment in the total amount of $34,600.10, comprising $28,927.67 in damages, $3,163.82 in
interest, $1,155.87 in costs, and $1,352.74 in attorney’s fees.  
The Court notes a number of defects with the submitted
default judgment package. 
First, Item
1(a) of the Request (Form CIV-00) incorrectly states that the Complaint in this
action was filed on September 9, 2023. The Complaint was filed on September 29,
2023. In addition, Item 1(b) of the Request references “Plaintiffs, Daniel
Acosta, et all.” It is thus unclear from Item 1(b) whether all (or only some)
of the plaintiffs in this action are seeking default judgment against
Defendants.   
Second, Item 2(a) of the Request (Form CIV-00) indicates that Plaintiffs
seek $28,927.68 in damages. However, Plaintiffs’ supporting declarations do not
indicate that Plaintiffs each seek $28,927.68 in damages. It is unclear why
this total amount is listed on the Request. Acosta states that he seeks $2,000
in minimum wages and $4,800 in waiting time penalties. (Acosta Decl., ¶
14(a)-(b).) Gomez states that he seeks $1,400 in minimum wages and
$4,200 in waiting time penalties. (Gomez Decl., ¶ 14(a)-(b).) Ochoa states that
he seeks $2,150 in minimum wages and $5,160 in waiting time penalties. (Ochoa
Decl., ¶ 14(a)-(b).) Sanchez states that she seeks $3,060 in minimum wages and
$6,120 in waiting time penalties. (Sanchez Decl., ¶14(a)-(b).) 
Third, Acosta states that “[p]ursuant to California
Labor Code section 1194, I seek to recover liquidated damages of the remaining
amount equal to the wages unlawfully unpaid, which taken together, should equal
$2,000 ($20 x 100 hours). Therefore, I request $450 in liquidated damages.”
(Acosta Decl., ¶ 9.) Similarly, Gomez states that “[p]ursuant to
California Labor Code section 1194, I seek to recover liquidated damages of the
remaining amount equal to the wages unlawfully unpaid, which taken together,
should equal $1,400 ($17.50 x 80 hours). Therefore, I request $160 in
liquidated damages.” (Gomez Decl., ¶ 9.) Ochoa states that “[p]ursuant to
California Labor Code section 1194, I seek to recover liquidated damages of the
remaining amount equal to the wages unlawfully unpaid, which taken together,
should equal $2,150 ($21.50 x 100 hours). Therefore, I request $600 in
liquidated damages.” (Ochoa Decl., ¶ 9.) Sanchez states that “[p]ursuant to
California Labor Code section 1194, I seek to recover liquidated damages of the
remaining amount equal to the wages unlawfully unpaid, which taken together,
should equal $3,060 ($25.50 x 100 hours). Therefore, I request $1,200 in
liquidated damages.” (Sanchez Decl., ¶ 9.) 
Labor Code section 1194, subdivision (a) provides that
“[n]otwithstanding any agreement to work for a lesser wage, any employee
receiving less than the legal minimum wage or the legal overtime compensation
applicable to the employee is entitled to recover in a civil action the unpaid
balance of the full amount of this minimum wage or overtime compensation,
including interest thereon, reasonable attorney’s fees, and costs of suit.” This
provision does not appear to provide for the requested liquidated damages, and
Plaintiffs do not appear to cite any additional legal authority supporting such
request.  
Fourth, Plaintiffs seek $3,163.82 in interest. However, Plaintiffs’
supporting declarations do not indicate that Plaintiffs each seek $3,163.82 in
interest. Rather, Acosta asserts that he is owed at least $753.33 in
prejudgment interest. (Acosta Decl., ¶ 14(c).) Gomez asserts that he is owed at
least $618.33 in prejudgment interest. (Gomez Decl., ¶ 14(c).) Ochoa asserts
that he is owed at least $803.83 in prejudgment interest. (Ochoa Decl., ¶
14(c).) Sanchez asserts that she is owed at least $1,020 in prejudgment
interest. (Ochoa Decl., ¶ 14(c).) In
addition, it is unclear from Plaintiffs’ supporting declarations how many days
of prejudgment interest each plaintiff seeks.   
Fifth, Plaintiffs have not set forth any legal authority
for certain requested costs that are not allowable under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1033.5, i.e., costs for a “Skip Trace.” (Request, Item 7(d).)
 
Sixth, Plaintiffs
do not appear to provide a supporting declaration from their counsel
substantiating the attorney’s fees requested.
Based on the foregoing, the Court denies the request for
default judgment without prejudice. The Court will discuss with Plaintiffs a
schedule for resubmission of the default judgment package.
