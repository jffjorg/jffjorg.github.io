And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied the request for default judgment without prejudice. The court notes several defects with the submitted default judgment package, including incorrect statements about the filing date and unclear information about the amount of damages sought. The court also questions the legal authority for the requested liquidated damages and the calculation of prejudgment interest. Additionally, the court takes issue with the request for costs related to a "Skip Trace" and the lack of a supporting declaration from counsel substantiating the attorney's fees requested. The court will discuss with the plaintiffs a schedule for resubmission of the default judgment package.
