  Case Number:  24STCV08986    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2024    Dept:  32      ANDY NICKERSON,                         Plaintiff,             v.   ERIC ICENOGLE,                          Defendant.           Case No.:  24STCV08986   Hearing Date:  December 4, 2024        [TENTATIVE]    order RE: defendant’s demurrer to first amended    complaint               BACKGROUND             On April 9, 2024, Plaintiff Andy  Nickerson filed this action against Defendant Eric Icenogle. Plaintiff filed  the operative First Amended Complaint on May 7, 2024, asserting causes of  action for (1) violation of the Unfair Competition Law (UCL) and (2) violation  of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA). The FAC alleges that Plaintiff  purchased a Ford Bronco from Defendant based on Defendant’s false  representations about the characteristics and quality of the vehicle.               On October 22, 2024, Defendant filed  the instant demurrer to the FAC. Plaintiff filed his opposition on November 19,  2024. Defendant filed his reply on November 26, 2024. LEGAL STANDARD A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether  the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When  considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in  context. (Taylor v. City of Los  Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)  In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the  pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.  (a).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other  extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior  Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the  defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a  demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with  extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.) DISCUSSION I.  Timeliness              “A person against whom a complaint  or cross-complaint has been filed may, within 30 days after service of the  complaint or cross-complaint, demur to the complaint or cross-complaint.” (Code  Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a).) However, a court retains discretion to “enlarge the  time for answer or demurrer.” (Id., § 473(a)(1); see also Jackson v.  Doe (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 742, 749 [“the trial court had discretion to  consider defendant's untimely demurrer”].)  Here, upon denying Defendant’s motion to  transfer venue, the Court ordered Defendant to file a responsive pleading  within 20 days. Defendant filed this demurrer, which is a responsive pleading, in  20 days as ordered. Thus, Defendant timely filed this demurrer within the  discretionary deadline imposed by the Court. In fact, the Court was required to  “allow the defendant time to move to strike, demur, or otherwise plead” upon  denying the motion to transfer. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 396b(e).) Thus, the  demurrer is timely.      II.  Meet and Confer Before filing a demurrer or a motion to  strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the  party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the  motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be  reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the  objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.)  Here, defense counsel’s declaration  provides no facts demonstrating meet and confer. The declaration states that  “[a]t the October 2, 2024 hearing, I indicated to the court and opposing  counsel that a demurrer would be forthcoming. No subsequent amendment has been  filed by Plaintiff.” This refers to the hearing on Defendant’s prior motion to  transfer venue, which the Court denied. A passing reference to a demurrer at an  unrelated hearing does not constitute a good faith effort to meet and confer on  the actual issues raised in the demurrer. Nevertheless, inadequate meet and confer  is not a reason to overrule a demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(4).)  Therefore, the Court proceeds on the merits. III.  CRLA             “Any consumer who suffers any damage  as a result of the use or employment by any person of a method, act, or  practice declared to be unlawful by Section 1770 may bring an action against  that person.” (Civ. Code, § 1780(a).) “‘Consumer’ means an individual who seeks  or acquires, by purchase or lease, any goods or services for personal, family,  or household purposes.” (Id., § 1761(d).)              Defendant argues that Plaintiff has  not pled facts demonstrating the use of the Bronco for personal, family, or  household purposes. Defendant contends that Plaintiff has alleged facts demonstrating  that the Bronco was used for business purposes. However, Defendant does not  actually cite the allegations from the FAC. Instead, Defendant cites to Exhibit  B of his Request for Judicial Notice, which consists of text messages between  Plaintiff and Defendant. This constitutes extrinsic evidence which has no  bearing on a demurrer. Even if the texts were attached to Plaintiff's  declaration in a prior filing, the Court cannot take judicial notice of the  truth of the contents therein. (See Herrera  v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1375.)              Furthermore,  none of the texts contain an express admission that the Bronco was not used for  personal, family, or household purposes. Defendant simply asks the Court to  infer from certain language in the texts that Plaintiff did not use the vehicle  for personal purposes. This is the type of factual inquiry unsuited for a  demurrer. At this stage, inferences are drawn in Plaintiff’s favor, not  Defendant’s.               Ultimately,  there is no defect on the face of the FAC demonstrating that the Bronco was not  used for personal, family, or household purposes. The facts alleged  sufficiently support a reasonable inference that the Bronco was used for  personal, family, or household purposes. Thus, Plaintiff has adequately pled  the CLRA claim.  IV. Unfair  Business Practices             Business  and Professions Code section 17200 prohibits unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent  business acts or practices. Each of the three prongs is an independent basis  for relief. (Smith v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. (2001)  93 Cal.App.4th 700, 718.) Unlawful conduct is defined as any practice forbidden  by law. (Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 377,  383.) UCL actions alleging unlawful conduct “borrow” from other statutes or  common law causes of action outside Section 17200. (Klein v. Chevron  U.S.A., Inc. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1342, 1383.)             Because  the CLRA claim has been adequately pled, it serves as the predicate “unlawful”  conduct supporting the UCL claim. Thus, the UCL claim is adequately pled.  CONCLUSION             Defendant’s  demurrer is OVERRULED.

     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s motion to dismiss 




 


 




BACKGROUND

            On April 9, 2024, Plaintiff Andy
Nickerson filed this action against Defendant Eric Icenogle. Plaintiff filed
the operative First Amended Complaint on May 7, 2024, asserting causes of
action for (1) violation of the Unfair Competition Law (UCL) and (2) violation
of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA). The FAC alleges that Plaintiff
purchased a Ford Bronco from Defendant based on Defendant’s false
representations about the characteristics and quality of the vehicle.  

            On October 2, 2024, the Court denied
Defendant’s motion to transfer venue to Tuolumne County, finding that Los
Angeles County is the proper venue under Code of Civil Procedure section
395(b).

            On October 22, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant motion to dismiss on the grounds that Plaintiff does not meet the
venue requirements of the CLRA. Plaintiff filed his opposition on November 19,
2024. Defendant filed his reply on November 26, 2024.   

 

LEGAL STANDARD

            An action under the CLRA “may be
commenced in the county in which the person against whom it is brought resides,
has his or her principal place of business, or is doing business, or in the
county where the transaction or any substantial portion thereof occurred.”
(Civ. Code, § 1780(d).) “[C]oncurrently with the filing of the complaint, the
plaintiff shall file an affidavit stating facts showing that the action has
been commenced in a county described in this section as a proper place for the
trial of the action. If a plaintiff fails to file the affidavit required by
this section, the court shall, upon its own motion or upon motion of any party,
dismiss the action without prejudice.” (Ibid.)

DISCUSSION

            The FAC, filed on May 7, 2024, is
accompanied by the declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel, attesting that “the
transaction took place in this jurisdiction.” (Barry Decl. ¶ 3.) Plaintiff also
filed a declaration on September 18, 2024, attesting that he signed the
purchase agreement while residing in Los Angeles County and that the vehicle
was delivered to him in Los Angeles County. (Nickerson Decl. ¶¶ 3, 6, 10, Ex.
B.) These facts show that “the transaction or any substantial portion thereof
occurred” in Los Angeles County. (See Civ. Code, § 1780(d).) Therefore, the
Court finds that Plaintiff has satisfied the venue requirements of the CLRA.      

CONCLUSION

            Defendant’s motion to dismiss is
DENIED.
