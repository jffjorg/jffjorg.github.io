```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint. The proposed amendment alleges that Heritage Auctioneers & Galleries, Inc. and its executive, Joseph Maddalena, sought to generate publicity for themselves by returning the original Star Trek starship model to Rod Roddenberry, thereby depriving the plaintiffs of promotional and reality content opportunities. The judge finds that this is a substantive change justifying the amendment. The judge also finds that the defendants' opposition to the amendment is without merit, as their denial of wrongdoing does not preclude the plaintiffs from making allegations in the complaint. The judge grants the motion for leave to file the amended complaint.
