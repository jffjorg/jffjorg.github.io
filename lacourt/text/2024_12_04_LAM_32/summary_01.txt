And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has ruled on Defendant's demurrer to the First Amended Complaint and has denied the demurrer. The Court finds that Plaintiff has adequately pled the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) claim and has satisfied the venue requirements of the CLRA. The Court also finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts demonstrating the use of the Ford Bronco for personal, family, or household purposes, which is a required element of the CLRA claim. Defendant's demurrer is therefore overruled, and the lawsuit will proceed.
