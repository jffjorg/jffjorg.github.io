And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case Hermosa Pier, LLC v. Karmic Energy, Inc., et al., and has denied Karmic Energy's motion to strike certain portions of the complaint. The motion to strike was based on the claim that the complaint contains irrelevant, false or improper matter. However, the judge found that the meet and confer process was not sufficient and that the issues raised by the defendants are complex and require further analysis. The judge also noted that the COVID-19 Tenant Protections Resolution may apply to the case, but that factual issues exist regarding the defendants' status as commercial tenants. The judge ordered the defendants to file and serve an answer within 10 days and ordered the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
