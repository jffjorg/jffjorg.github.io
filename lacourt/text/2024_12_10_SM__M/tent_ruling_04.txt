Property Manager LLC v. Drinkwater

MOTION:                  Motion
to Compel Initial Discovery Responses
HEARING DATE:   12/10/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.280(b), a party may move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). “Failure to timely respond to RFA does not
result in automatic admissions. Rather, the propounder of the RFA must ‘move
for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction’ under § 2023.010 et seq.” (CCP, § 2033.280(b).) The court “shall”
grant the motion to deem RFA admitted, “unless it finds that the party to whom
the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on
the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in
substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (CCP, § 2033.280(c).) 
   
ANALYSIS 
 
Plaintiff Diplomat Property Manager LLC moves to deem matters
admitted as to its Requests for Admissions (Set One) against Defendant Ginger
Drinkwater, and requests sanctions against Drinkwater in the amount of
$1,215.00.
 
On August 9, 2024, Plaintiff served Drinkwater with RFA, Set No. 1.
(Yassin Decl., ¶ 2.) Drinkwater’s responses were due September 13, 2024. On
September 17, 2024, having received no discovery responses, Plaintiff sent a
letter to Drinkwater notifying her of the outstanding responses and requesting
responses by September 30, 2024.. (Yassin Decl., ¶ 4.) Drinkwater failed to
respond to the outstanding discovery. (¶¶ 5-6.) Plaintiff thus demonstrates
Drinkwater’s failure to respond to duly served RFAs. No opposition was
submitted.
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED. Sanctions are mandatory, without
exception. Sanctions are imposed in the reasonable amount of $710.00, taking into
consideration the nature of the motion and no need for a reply brief.
