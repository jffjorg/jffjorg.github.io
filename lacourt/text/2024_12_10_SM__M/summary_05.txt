And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Richard A. Heller, is seeking to compel the defendant, Andrea Bosilic, to provide initial answers to discovery requests and to produce documents. The plaintiff also requests sanctions against the defendant and her counsel for failing to respond to the discovery requests. The judge grants the motion and orders the defendant to provide responses within 5 days. The judge also imposes sanctions in the amount of $1,751.54 against the defendant and her counsel, jointly and severally, payable within 30 days. The judge's decision is based on the fact that the defendant failed to provide any response to the discovery requests, despite being served with the requests on October 31, 2024, and despite meet and confer efforts to resolve the issue.
