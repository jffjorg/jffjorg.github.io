for Summary Judgment
HEARING DATE:   12/10/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
A party may move for summary judgment in any action or
proceeding if it is contended the action has no merit or that there is no
defense to the action or proceeding. (CCP, § 437c(a).) “The purpose of the law
of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the
parties' pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations,
trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  
 
“A party may move for summary adjudication as to one or
more causes of action within an action, one or more affirmative defenses, one
or more claims for damages, or one or more issues of duty, if the party
contends that the cause of action has no merit, that there is no affirmative
defense to the cause of action, that there is no merit to an affirmative defense
as to any cause of action, that there is no merit to a claim for damages, as
specified in¿Section 3294 of the Civil Code, or that one or more defendants
either owed or did not owe a duty to the plaintiff or plaintiffs.”¿(CCP,¿§
437c(f)(1).)¿If a party seeks summary adjudication as an alternative to a
request for summary judgment, the request must be clearly made in the notice of
the motion. (Gonzales v. Superior Court¿(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1542,
1544.)¿ “[A] party may move for summary adjudication of a legal issue or a
claim for damages other than punitive damages that does not completely
dispose of a cause of action, affirmative defense, or issue of duty
pursuant to” subdivision (t). (CCP,¿§ 437c(t).)¿ 
 
To prevail, the evidence submitted must show there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.¿(CCP, §¿437c(c).)¿The motion cannot succeed unless
the evidence leaves no room for conflicting inferences as to material facts;
the court has no power to weigh one inference against another or against other
evidence. (Murillo v. Rite Stuff Food Inc. (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th
833, 841.) In determining whether the facts give rise to a triable issue of
material fact, “[a]ll doubts as to whether any material, triable, issues of
fact exist are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing summary judgment…”
(Gold v. Weissman (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1195, 1198-99.) “In other
words, the facts alleged in the evidence of the party opposing summary judgment
and the reasonable inferences there from must be accepted as true.” (Jackson
v. County of Los Angeles (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 171, 179.) However, if
adjudication is otherwise proper the motion “may not be denied on grounds of
credibility,” except when¿a material fact is the witness’s¿state of mind and
“that fact is sought to be established solely by the [witness’s] affirmation
thereof.” (CCP, § 437c(e).)¿ 
 
Once the moving party has met their burden, the burden
shifts to the opposing party “to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.” (CCP §
437c(p)(1).) “[T]here¿is no
obligation on the opposing party... to establish anything by affidavit unless
and until the moving party has by affidavit stated facts establishing every
element... necessary to sustain a judgment in his favor.”¿(Consumer Cause,
Inc. v.¿SmileCare¿(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 454, 468.)¿ 
¿ 
“The pleadings play a key role in a summary judgment
motion. The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to
delimit the scope of the issues and to¿frame¿the outer measure of materiality
in a summary judgment proceeding.” (Hutton v. Fidelity National Title Co.¿(2013)
213 Cal.App.4th 486, 493, quotations and citations omitted.) “Accordingly, the
burden of a defendant moving for summary judgment only requires that he or she
negate plaintiff's theories of liability¿as alleged in the complaint;
that is, a moving party need not refute liability on some theoretical
possibility not included in the pleadings.” (Ibid.)¿ 
 
Analysis
 
Defendant Barlow Respiratory
Hospital moves for summary judgment against Plaintiff Curtis Pollard’s
complaint, or in the alternative, summary  adjudication
on the following issues:
 
1. The cause of action for Dependent
Abuse is barred because there is no triable issue of
material fact that Barlow Respiratory Hospital did not abuse
or neglect the plaintiff, Curtis Pollard;
2. The cause of action for Medical
Malpractice is barred because there is no triable issue of material fact that
the care and treatment provided by Barlow Respiratory Hospital met the standard
of care; and 
3. The cause of action for Medical
Malpractice is barred because there is no triable issue of material fact that
no act or omission by Barlow Respiratory Hospital caused injury to the
plaintiff, Curtis Pollard.
 
Medical Malpractice (Issues 2-3)
 
A prima facie case for medical
malpractice consists of (1) a duty to conform to the relevant standard of care;
(2) a breach of that duty, i.e., the negligent conduct; (3) a proximate causal
connection between the negligent conduct and the injury; and (4) resulting
damage. (Lattimore v. Dickey¿(2015) 239 Cal.App.4th 959, 968.)¿ Duty
is measured by the standard of care in the medical community.¿(Munro v.
Regents of the University of California¿(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 977.)
A¿healthcare provider is negligent if he or she fails to use the level of
skill, knowledge, and care in diagnosis and treatment that other reasonably
careful healthcare providers of the same type would use in the same or similar
circumstances. (Landeros¿v. Flood¿(1976) 17 Cal.3d 399, 408; see¿Elam
v. College Park Hospital¿(1982) 132 Cal. App. 3d 332 [every hospital is
responsible for acting with due care to investigate and confirm the competency
of physicians and to monitor those¿physicians to assure that patients receive
the proper care].)¿As the practice of medicine is not within the common
knowledge of lay persons, expert opinion testimony is necessary to establish
the standard of care. (Jambazian¿v. Borden¿(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 836,
844.) 
 
A defendant moving for summary
judgment in a medical malpractice action must “present evidence that would
preclude a reasonable trier of fact from finding it was more likely than not
that their treatment fell below the standard of care.”¿ (Johnson v. Superior
Court (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 297, 305.) “Both the standard of care and
defendants’ breach must normally be established by expert testimony in a
medical malpractice case.”¿(Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center
(2008) 159 Cal. App. 4th 463, 467.) “When a defendant moves for summary
judgment and supports his motion with expert declarations that his conduct fell
within the community standard of care, he is entitled to summary judgment
unless the plaintiff comes forward with conflicting expert evidence.”¿(Munro
v. Regents of University of California (1989) 215 Cal. App. 3d 977,
984-985.)¿An expert declaration, if uncontradicted, is conclusive proof as to
the prevailing standard of care and the propriety of the particular conduct of
the health care provider.¿(Starr v. Mooslin (1971) 14 Cal. App. 3d 988,
999.)¿ 
 
Defendant presents the declaration of
Lisa Moore, MSN, RN-BC, CWCA. Moore concludes that the care and treatment
provided by the Hospital staff met the standard of care and, to a reasonable
degree of medical probability, did not cause Plaintiff’s injury. (Moore Decl., pp.
7-8; see UMF 21-28.) She also opines that the Hospital’s conduct did not
constitute abuse or neglect of a dependent adult. (Moore Decl., ¶¶ 27-28.) For
example, on admission, Pollard’s condition was assessed by the nurses, and
orders were obtained for wound care management, which appropriately included
Santyl topical ointment, a low air loss mattress, and turning and repositioning
the patient every two hours. (¶ 29.) Defendant changed the topical medication
to Plurogel for the patient’s coccyx wound. (Id.) Additional wound care orders
also included cleaning the sacral coccygeal area with Anasept, applying
Plurogel, covering with Optifoam, and changing the dressing daily and as needed
due to soilage. (Id.) Weekly wound assessments were performed, and the wound
was photographed in order to document its condition. (Id.) Plaintiff was turned
and repositioned on a routine basis. (¶ 30, citing Exhibit U-Barlow Vol. 1
records p.001619 – 001626, and Exhibit V-Barlow Vol. 2 records p.22291 – 22364;
Exhibit W-Barlow Vol. 1 records p.001772 – 001829; and Exhibit X-Barlow Vol. 2
records p.23554 –24412.) The records also demonstrate that the nurses provided
care and treatment to the coccyx wound on a “routine basis and as needed
pursuant to treatment orders” and provided Plaintiff with adequate hygiene and nutrition.
(Id.) 
 
Moore also states that the
progression of the coccyx wound while Pollard was admitted to Barlow was the unfortunate
result of the impact of his underlying comorbidities and not the result of
anything the nurses or wound care specialists did or failed to do for Pollard.
(UMF 26; Moore Decl., ¶ 31.) The deep tissue injury developed outside Barlow. (¶
32.) The integrity of Pollard’s tissue and skin was further compromised by his
underlying conditions and medications, such as sepsis, vasopressor medications,
and acute myocardial infarction. (Id.) Pollard’s coccyx wound was debrided,
evidencing assessment and communication by the nurses and wound care
specialist. (¶ 33.) Plaintiff’s condition improved and he was able to be discharged
home. (Id.) She concludes that the progression of the wound at Barlow as more
likely than not the result of the impact Mr. Pollard’s underlying conditions,
and not the result of anything the nurses and wound care specialists did or
failed to do in caring for his wound. (Id.)
 
In response, Plaintiff proffers the
declaration of Aaron Clousing, SN, R.N., FNP-C-WOCN, RNFA. He observes that two
days after Plaintiff’s admittance, the patient was assessed for a wound
notified on admission as a deep tissue injury to sacrum area. (Clousing Decl.,
¶ 6.) Dr. Marshak performed the assessment and directed the standards forth for
aggressive wound care and topical therapy. (Id.) Around November 2021, the
patient’s sacrum pressure injury began to deteriorate. This change in the
status of the pressure injury was not documented in the record other than
weekly pictures. (Id., ¶ 7.) As the sacrum wound progressed over time, there
were no further care plans developed or communicated to prevent further wound
breakdown. (Id., ¶ 8.) On December 9, 2021, a surgical debridement removed
devitalized and necrotic tissue, creating a stage three to stage four pressure
injury. (¶ 9.) After December 9, 2021, and through Plaintiff’s discharge, Clousing
opined that the Hospital’s treatment, documentation and follow up therapy fell
below standard of care. (¶ 10.) Clousing observes that regular scheduled wound
assessments were not followed or provided by wound care provider, wound
description/wound specific assessment by nursing was not performed, and the
family was not educated or updated related to change of condition of the
patient. Clousing also observes that there was no consideration of why skin
failure was diagnosed, why response to therapy was not effective, or what
changes or alternative care was performed to prevent deterioration. (¶ 11.) Clousing
also opines that there was poor documentation of the initial wound status (no
description of wound), no status updates regarding response to therapy and
current regiment after debridement procedure, and limited patient progress
after and during therapy leading up and through the debridement procedures. (¶
12.) Clousing reiterates that Defendant’s conduct fell below the standard of
care by not educating the family on the disease process and expectations for
interventions related to but not limited to wound care, topical therapy, and
the need for regular surgical interventions. (¶ 13.) Clousing also questions
why the wound was not improving and the poor documentation related to patient
clinical state indicating barriers to wound healing. (Id. ¶¶ 12-13.)
 
            Accordingly,
there is a dispute of material fact as to whether the Hospital’s treatment met
the standard of care.  The motion for
summary judgment is DENIED, and the motion for summary adjudication is DENIED
as to issues nos. 2-3.
 
Issue no. 1: Dependent Abuse
 
Defendant moves for summary
adjudication of the abuse cause of action on the grounds that the Hospital did
not abuse or neglect Plaintiff. The elements of Elder/Dependent Adult Abuse are
that defendant: (1) had responsibility for meeting the basic needs of the elder
or dependent adult, such as nutrition, hydration, hygiene or medical care
[citations]; (2) knew of conditions that made the elder or dependent adult
unable to provide for his or her own basic needs [citations]; and (3) denied or
withheld goods or services necessary to meet the elder or dependent adult’s
basic needs, either with knowledge that injury was substantially certain to befall
the elder or dependent adult (if the plaintiff alleges oppression, fraud or
malice) or with conscious disregard of the high probability of such injury (if
the plaintiff alleges recklessness) [citations].” (Carter v. Prime
Healthcare Paradise Valley LLC (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 396,
406-407.)   
 
 “‘[N]eglect’ within the
meaning of Welfare and Institutions Code section 15610.57 covers an area of
misconduct potentially overlapping, but distinct from, “professional
negligence.” As used in the Act, neglect refers not to the substandard performance
of medical services but, rather, to the ‘failure of those responsible for
attending to the basic needs and comforts of elderly or dependent adults,
regardless of their professional standing, to carry out their custodial
obligations.’” (Covenant Care, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal.4th
771, 783; see Winn v. Pioneer Medical Group, Inc. (2016) 63 Cal.4th 148,
152 [“It is the nature of the elder or dependent adult’s relationship with the
defendant—not the defendant’s professional standing—that makes the defendant
potentially liable for neglect”].) 
¿¿¿  
“Oppression, fraud, and malice
involve intentional, willful, or conscious wrongdoing of a despicable or
injurious nature.” (Carter, supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at 405, internal
quotation marks omitted.) Recklessness requires deliberate disregard of a high
degree of probability an injury will occur. (Id.) The enhanced
remedies for Elder Abuse are only available for “acts of egregious abuse
against elder and dependent adults.” (Id.) There must be
authorization or ratification on the part of a managing agent to recover
against corporate defendants. (Civ. Code, § 3294; Welf. & Inst. Code, §
15657(c).)¿¿ 
 
            Defendant again
relies on the declaration of Ms. Moore. Moore concludes the Hospital’s conduct
did not constitute abuse or neglect of a dependent adult. (Moore Decl., ¶¶
27-28; UMF 22-25.) Moore claims that the records demonstrate that the nurses
provided care and treatment to the coccyx wound on a routine basis and as
needed pursuant to treatment orders and provided Pollard with adequate hygiene
and nutrition. Plaintiff demonstrates a dispute of these material facts. Mashreghi
testified that Barlow was slow to respond to dressings soiled with feces, did
not properly requisition the topical Plurogel needed for
Plaintiff’s coccyx wound, would not
assure that Plaintiff ate his meals when he needed the
nutrition to heal his wounds, served
“nasty” inedible food, cross contaminated between patents
leading to Plaintiff’s C. Auris
infection, and that Barlow was so short staffed that the
CNAs and Nurses were unable to
provide care. (UMF 22-23; Mashreghi Depo. 79:7-19; 80:2-12;
82:5-83:4; 85:23-86:2; 92:5-11; 83:5-20; 88:9-90:15; 120:1-6l 121:1-15;
90:12-15; 99:14-16; 103:6-17; 107:2-14;110:13-14; 101:10-15; 108:10-22;
93:17-23.) Mashreghi further testified that Barlow allowed Plaintiff to sit in
soiled dressings and would not promptly respond when notified that Plaintiff’s
dressing were soiled with feces. Plaintiff’s wife would often have to change
the dressing herself because the Barlow staff was unresponsive. (UMF 24;
Mashreghi Depo. 83:5-20; 88:9-90:15.) Plaintiff’s wife testified that she
observed and complained to a Barlow supervisor that Plaintiff’s wound dressing
had not been changed all day, and that Plaintiff was left bleeding due to an
injection and had been bleeding for hours and was soaked in blood. (AMF 10,
16.) Plaintiff presents an expert opinion that the Hospital failed to document
and develop wound care plans when Plaintiff’s Pressure ulcer began to progress,
and failed to document or describe why Plaintiff’s pressure wound was becoming worse.
(Clousing Decl., ¶¶ 10-13.) This evidence creates a dispute of material fact as
to abuse and neglect.
 
The parties also provide extensive
briefing on whether Defendant’s managing agent(s) ratified any act of malice,
oppression and fraud. Defendant proffers no evidence or material fact in
support of its argument that the Hospital was not reckless, oppressive, fraudulent,
and/or malicious and that there was no ratification by any managing agent.
Defendant’s separate statement does not contain any facts or evidence
pertaining to the issues of recklessness, oppression, fraud, malice or
ratification. (See United Community Church v. Garcin (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 327, 337 [“This is the Golden Rule of Summary Adjudication: if it is
not set forth in the separate statement, it does not exist.”].) Therefore,
Defendant fails to meet its burden on this issue. 
Accordingly, the motion for summary
adjudication is DENIED as to issue no. 1.
