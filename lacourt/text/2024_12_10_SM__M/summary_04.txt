And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to respond to initial discovery requests and has imposed sanctions on the defendant for failing to respond. The plaintiff served the defendant with requests for admissions (RFA) on August 9, 2024, and the defendant failed to respond by September 13, 2024. The plaintiff sent a notification of outstanding responses on September 17, 2024, but the defendant failed to respond again by September 30, 2024. The judge found that the defendant's failure to respond was willful and that the plaintiff is entitled to sanctions. The judge imposed sanctions in the amount of $710.00, which is less than the amount requested by the plaintiff ($1,215.00).
