And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motion to strike the cost memorandum filed by the defendant, Jovon Mitchell, and has issued a tentative ruling. The plaintiff, Sandy Le, is the prevailing party in the case and is entitled to recover costs as a matter of right. The judge has found that the majority of the items of costs claimed by the plaintiff are allowable, including the costs of motions, expert witnesses, and service of process. However, the judge has taxed certain costs as not being reasonably necessary for the litigation, including costs related to accident reconstruction, investigation, and medical records. The judge has also found that the costs for service-related items, such as overnight delivery, were not justified and were merely convenient to the preparation of the case. The motion to strike the cost memorandum is granted in part, and the cost memorandum is taxed in the amount of $51,051.45.
