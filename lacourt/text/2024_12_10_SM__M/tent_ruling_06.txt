to Tax/Strike Costs

Legal
Standard
 
In general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter
of right to recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (CCP § 1032(b);
Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606.) “Prevailing party”
includes the party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a
dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains
any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any
relief against that defendant. (CCP § 1032 (a)(4).) 
 
“Allowable costs shall be reasonably necessary to the
conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its
preparation.” (CCP § 1033.5(c)(2).) “If the items appearing in a cost bill
appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to
show that they were not reasonable or necessary.” (Ladas v. California State
Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal. App. 4th 761, 774.) On the other hand, if the
items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof
is on the party claiming them as costs. (Id.) 
 
Analysis
 
Defendant Jovon Mitchell moves to
strike the memorandum of costs submitted by Plaintiff Sandy Le. On July 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed a cost memorandum,
claiming $52,828.46 in costs.
 
There is no reasonable dispute that
Plaintiff is owed costs as the prevailing party in this action. Defendant
accepted Plaintiff’s 998 offer without securing a waiver of costs. Plaintiff
obtained a $50,000.00 payment from Defendant. Plaintiff is therefore the
prevailing party and entitled to costs as a matter of right.
 
Defendant argues that the cost bill
should be stricken in its entirety due to Plaintiffs' failure to provide breakdown
of her claimed costs. Plaintiff provides sufficient foundation for the costs with
the declaration attached to the cost memorandum and the declaration presented
in opposition, except where otherwise noted. (Marchino Decl.) Defendant also argues
that costs should be denied unless attributable to the prosecution of the case
against himself only and not all the defendants. Defendant proffers no legal
authority for such a proposition. Defendant chose to settle the action without
first resolving the allocation of costs, risking a substantial cost award
against himself.
 
Defendant cites no authority that
the April 2019 letter constituted a Code of Civil Procedure section 998 offer
which would limit Plaintiff’s claimed costs. This was not a compliant 998 offer
because the letter was sent to the firm Filippo Marchino after Plaintiff was
not represented by that firm. The April 2019 letter was sent to Eagan Avenatti
LLP in Newport Beach after it had withdrawn as counsel for Le and been replaced
by her current firm, the X-Law Group, P.C., more than six months before the
letter. (Marchino Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.) Plaintiff did not apparently have notice of
this letter. Thus, this letter cannot equitably undercut Plaintiff’s right to
costs.
 
The majority of the items of costs are expressly allowable,
including items 1, 2, 4 and 5. (CCP § 1033.5(a).) These costs are properly charged.
 On the other hand, the “Other”
category of costs is properly taxed. Plaintiff claims the following items as
part of the “Other” item of costs:
 
a. Collision and Injury Dynamics -
Mitchell accident reconstruction: $13,397.48
b. Gammill Law - Investigation re
Criminal Sentencing Mitchell: $13,250.00
c. Lupin Solutions LLC - Medical
Records re Drugs & Alcohol (Mitchell): $15,250.00
d. Los Angeles Private Detectives -
Investigative & service of process (Mitchell): $9,125.00
f. USPS Service - Reply of Motion
to Compel Mitchell Depo: $7.35
g. FedEx - Motion to Compel Mitchell
Service: $21.62
Total “Other” costs: $51,051.45.
 
Each of these sub-items will be
taxed. The costs for “accident reconstruction” are expressly disallowed by Code
of Civil Procedure section 1033.5(b)(1)-(2) as expert witness fees and
investigation expenses. Likewise, section 1033.5(b) disallows the costs related
to the “investigation re sentencing,” “medical records re Drugs & Alcohol,”
and costs for “private detective” investigations for the same reasons. These sub-items
would either be either an expert witness fee, investigation expense, or an attorneys’
fee, which are expressly not allowed as costs. Only the service-related items (f
and g) are potentially discretionary costs. However, as these were not
requested as a part of item one (costs of motion fees), the Court assumes that
these are for additional services related to service of the motion to compel
(e.g., overnight service), and not for any court-required filing fees. Plaintiff
does not explain why the USPS and FedEx service fees were reasonably necessary
for the litigation. Thus, these costs were not “reasonably necessary” for the
litigation, but rather, merely convenient to its preparation.
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED
in part. The Court taxes the costs memorandum in the amount of $51,051.45.
