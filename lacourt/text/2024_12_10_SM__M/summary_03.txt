And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by defendants Carole Boag, The Carole Boag Company Inc., Tepper & Associates, and Foster Tepper to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by plaintiff Beverly Wilshire Investment Company LLC. The defendants have asserted a demurrer for uncertainty, arguing that the FAC is unclear as to who was renting the premises and on what terms. The judge has ruled that the demurrer for uncertainty is overruled, finding that the FAC's causes of action are not uncertain and that the defendants can determine what issues must be admitted or denied.

The defendants have also lodged a special demurrer to causes of action 2-5, arguing that the FAC fails to allege whether the subject contract(s) were written, oral, or implied by conduct. The judge has ruled that this demurrer is also overruled, finding that the FAC alleges a written contract exists between the parties and that the other causes of action are either dependent upon this contract or not dependent upon a contract at all.

The judge has ordered the defendants to file an answer within ten days.
