The judge grants the motion of Attorney Jeffrey A. Dracup and Dracup & Patterson, Inc. to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Manchester Legal Group, LLC. The motion was filed on January 8, 2024, and no opposition was filed. The judge finds that there is no evidence that the Defendant would be unduly prejudiced by the granting of this motion, as the pending trial date is still two months away. Therefore, the Defendant has sufficient time to retain a new attorney and prepare for the upcoming trial. An Order to Show Cause (OSC) is set for March 11, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. to strike the Answer of the Defendant if it does not have a new attorney of record representing it in this case by that date.
