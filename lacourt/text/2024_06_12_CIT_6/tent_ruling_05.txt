   [1] Defendant is  alleged to be two separate entities in the FAC, i.e., Sistine Manor, Inc. and  Springville Residential Care for the Elderly. (FAC, ¶¶ 4-5.) However, Defendant  refers to itself as Defendant  Sistine Manor, Inc. dba Springville Residential Care for the Elderly in its  motions. (Notice of Demurrer, 1:28-2:1; Notice of Motion to Strike,    [2] The Court notes that another action  pending between the same parties on the same cause of action is a separate  basis for demurrer under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision  (c). (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (c).)    [3] The Court  also notes as it did in ruling on Defendant’s demurrer to the Second Amended  Complaint in the Related Case that lack of capacity is a separate basis for  demurrer under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (b). (Order  re Tentative Ruling (1/29/24), LASC Case Number 22PSCV01623; Code Civ. Proc., §  430.10, subd. (b).) This should have been stated in the demurrer portion of  Defendant’s notice of demurrer. (Notice of Demurrer, 2:6-10; Code Civ. Proc., §  430.60; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1320, subd. (a).) The Court admonishes Defendant  to comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure and California  Rules of Court going forward.
