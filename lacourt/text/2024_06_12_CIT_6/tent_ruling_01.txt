  Case Number:  23PSCV02478    Hearing Date:   June 12, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff
Regions Bank’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendant: Kristhopper Marroquin aka Kristhopper Marroquin Perez 
TENTATIVE RULING           
Plaintiff’s request for entry of
default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.           
BACKGROUND           
            This
is a breach of contract case. On August 14, 2023, plaintiff Regions Bank, an
Alabama State Bank and successor by merger of Ascentium Capital, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (Plaintiff), filed this action against
defendants Signalia, LLC, Kristhopper Marroquin aka Kristhopper Marroquin Perez
(Defendant), and Does 1 through 20, alleging causes of action for breach of
equipment finance agreement, breach of guaranty, and conversion. On February
13, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed Signalia, LLC. On June 5, 2024, Plaintiff
dismissed the cause of action for conversion, in addition to dismissing the Doe
Defendants.[1]      
LEGAL
STANDARD 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration
of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all
parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate
judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of
grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for
attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS 
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendant in the total amount of $186,273.15,
including $172,418.30 in principal damages, $2,685.90 in special damages, $9,278.05
in attorney fees, and $ 1,890.00 in costs. The Court finds multiple problems
with the default judgment package. First, the request for entry of default
judgment submitted on Form CIV-100 misspells Defendant’s last name as “Perezi”
instead of “Perez.” (Request for Entry of Default Judgment, ¶ 1, subd. (d).) This
might also explain why the clerk’s office indicated “there is no default
request” and ticked the box indicating “Default NOT entered as requested…” (Id.,
p. 1.) 
Second, the
damage amounts seem to conflict with each other across all of the submitted
documentation. For example, the request for entry of default judgment indicates
$172,418.30 in principal damages, whereas the proposed judgment indicates $172,568.30.
(Request for Entry of Default Judgment, ¶ 2, subd. (a); Proposed Judgment, 2:4.) 
Third, the
declaration of Jerry Noon indicates a Site Inspection, Title Fee, and
Documentation Fee of $920.00, but the proposed judgment indicates $770.00 for
those fees. (Noon Decl., ¶ 15; Proposed Judgment, 2:6.) The complaint also only
indicates $770.00 for those fees. (Compl., ¶ 15; Id., Prayer for Relief,
6:25-26.) 
Fourth, it
is not entirely clear how Plaintiff calculated the principal amount due. The notice
of default and acceleration served on Defendant indicates a total of
$182,801.69, but Mr. Noon’s declaration says the total due is $184,023.91.
(Noon Decl., ¶ 13, Ex. 5.) Plaintiff’s ledger and payment history also shows a
then-current balance of $189,948.91 on February 7, 2023, which is the amount
that matches the demand in the complaint. (Id., Ex. 6; Compl., Prayer
for Relief, 6:19-21.) 
Fifth,
Plaintiff’s requested attorney’s fees exceeds the amount permitted under Local
Rule 3.214. The way this rule works is for Plaintiff to look at the principal
amount sought, subtract the applicable amount, e.g. $100,000.00 from any damages
exceeding $100,000.00, multiply the remaining amount by the applicable
percentage, and then add the remaining flat fee portion. (See Local Rule
3.214.) Plaintiff’s calculation does not follow this formula, but instead
incorrectly segments each portion of the total damages sought and applies the
formula to each portion, and essentially compounds the total fees. (Noon Decl.,
¶ 24.) It is also unclear to the Court if Plaintiff is even entitled to collect
attorney’s fees against Defendant, since the guaranty does not expressly
mention attorney’s fees. (Noon Decl., Ex. 2, p. 2.) 
Finally,
the Court finds the costs requested excessive. Plaintiff provides no
explanation for $1,455.90 in process server fees. (Request for Entry of Default
Judgment, ¶ 7, subd. (b).) The Court finds it extremely unlikely that Plaintiff
could incur that much in process server fees in the span of nine days from the
date the complaint was filed on August 14, 2023, until it was personally served
on Defendant on August 23, 2023. (Proof of Service (8/23/23); see generally,
Compl.) In fact, this amount appears to be contradicted by the proof of
service, which only indicates process server fees in the amount of $157.80.
(Proof of Service (8/23/23), ¶ 7, subd. (d).) 
CONCLUSION           
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
