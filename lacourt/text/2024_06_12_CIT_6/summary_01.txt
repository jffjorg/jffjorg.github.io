Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Judge has denied Regions Bank's request for entry of default judgment against Kristhopper Marroquin, citing several problems with the default judgment package. The package misspells the defendant's last name, has conflicting damage amounts, and lacks clear calculations of principal amounts due. Additionally, the requested attorney's fees exceed the amount permitted under Local Rule 3.214, and the process server fees are unclear and possibly excessive. The Judge has denied the request for default judgment without prejudice.
