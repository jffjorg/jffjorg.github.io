And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied without prejudice the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment against the defendant. The judge found multiple problems with the default judgment package, including misspelling of the defendant's last name, conflicting damage amounts, incorrect calculation of principal amount due, excessive attorney's fees, and excessive process server fees. The judge also questioned the entitlement of the plaintiff to collect attorney's fees against the defendant.
