BACKGROUND
 
On June 16, 2022, Defendant 2MANGAS, INC. (“Defendant”) initially
noticed Plaintiff Anton Davis (“Plaintiff”)’s deposition for July 27, 2022. (Stoker
Decl. ¶ 4; Exh. A [notice of deposition].) On February 27, 2023, the deposition
was continued and a notice was served upon Plaintiff rescheduling for April 5,
2023. (Ibid. at ¶ 5; Exh. B [amended notice].) On December 8, 2023, the
deposition was further continued and Defendant noticed Plaintiff’s deposition
for January 23, 2024. (Ibid. at ¶ 6; Exh. C [amended notice].) On
January 22, 2024, this deposition was canceled at the request of Plaintiff. No
alternate dates were provided. (Ibid. at ¶ 7.) On January 25, 2024,
defense counsel sent opposing party a meet and confer letter requesting Plaintiff’s
availability for a rescheduled deposition. (Ibid. at ¶ 8; Exh. D [meet
and confer letter].) On February 22, 2024, Defendant requested Plaintiff to
confirm his appearance at his February 23, 2024, deposition. (Ibid. at ¶
10; Exh. F [February 22, 2024 communication].) Opposing counsel stated they
still needed to confirm with Plaintiff. (Ibid.) Plaintiff failed to
appear at the February 23, 2024, deposition. (Ibid. at ¶ 11.) On April
11, 2024, defense counsel sent a final notice of continuance, rescheduling
Plaintiff’s deposition for May 8, 2024. (Ibid. at ¶ 13.) To date,
Plaintiff has failed to appear for a deposition or provide available dates. (Ibid.
at ¶ 15.) Defendant now moves the Court to compel Plaintiff’s deposition.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Any party may
obtain any discovery of information, documents, land, property, or
electronically stored information so long as the discoverable matter is not privileged,
is relevant to the subject matter and can lead one to admissible
evidence. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010.)
 
Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.450 provides in pertinent part the following:
 
“(a) If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an
organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a
valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to
proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the
party giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent's
attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.
 
(b) A motion
under subdivision (a) shall comply with both of the following:
  
(1) The motion shall set forth
specific facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.
 
(2) The motion shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040 or, when the
deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents,
electronically stored information, or things described in the deposition
notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent
to inquire about the nonappearance.
 
Where a motion to compel a party’s appearance
and testimony at deposition is granted, the court shall impose a monetary
sanction in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the
deponent, unless the court finds the one subject to sanctions acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
On motion of a party who, in person or by attorney, attended at the time and
place specified in the deposition notice in the expectation that the deponent’s
testimony would be taken, the court shall impose a monetary sanction in favor
of that party and against the deponent.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (g)(2).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendants have met all
requirements to compel deposition: the parties sufficiently met and conferred,
the deposition was properly noticed for a date agreed upon by all parties, no
objections were served, and Plaintiff failed to appear or reschedule a
deposition. Plaintiff is ordered to sit for his deposition within 20 days of this
hearing.
Defendant
requests sanctions in the amount of $1,135.00, consisting of a $60.00 filing
fee and five hours of work at a rate of $215.00 per hour. Sanctions are
mandatory and the Court fails to find Plaintiff acted with substantial
justification. Plaintiff continuously failed to appear for or reschedule his
deposition, thereby causing Defendant to incur fees associated with filing the
present motion. The Court reduces sanctions to the amount of $705.00,
consisting of a $60.00 filing fee and three hours of work at an hourly rate of
$215.00. Therefore, the Court orders against Plaintiff Anton Davis and his
attorney Ronda R. Dixon, jointly and severally, to pay sanctions of $705.00, payable
to defense counsel within 30 days of this hearing.
 
Moving party to give
