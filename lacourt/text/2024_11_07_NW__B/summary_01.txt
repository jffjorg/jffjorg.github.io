And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the application of Robert Wright, Esq. to appear pro hac vice on behalf of defendants Sunrise Senior Living, LLC and Sunrise Senior Living Management, Inc. The application was denied due to the failure to pay the required $50.00 fee, as required by Cal. Rules of Court Rule 9.40. The application was otherwise complete and met the requirements of the rule, but the lack of payment of the fee renders it incomplete. The application is denied without prejudice, meaning that it can be re-filed if the required fee is paid.
