And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants' motion to compel the deposition of two non-appearing plaintiffs. The judge orders the non-appearing plaintiffs to produce a list of three available deposition dates within 10 days. Additionally, the judge sanctions the non-appearing plaintiffs, along with their counsel, in the amount of $2,966.50 for costs and fees incurred as a result of their non-appearances. The judge finds that the non-appearing plaintiffs did not establish good cause for their failure to appear for deposition and did not demonstrate that they could not have sought a stay in the deposition at an earlier time. The judge's ruling is subject to modification based on any submissions made by the parties.
