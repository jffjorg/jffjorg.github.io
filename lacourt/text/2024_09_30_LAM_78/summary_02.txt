And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is about a breach of contract case between plaintiff Esperanza McCorkendale and defendants Joe Byron, et al. The plaintiff filed a complaint alleging that Byron agreed to sell the restaurant Egg Heaven to her, but refused to sell and took money from the restaurant's bank account. The plaintiff also filed motions to compel further responses to requests for admissions and form interrogatories, which were opposed by the defendants. The court found that the plaintiff properly met and conferred with the defendants, and that the defendants' objections to the requests for admissions were without merit. The court granted the plaintiff's motions to compel further responses to the requests for admissions and form interrogatories. The court also declined to award sanctions to any party.
