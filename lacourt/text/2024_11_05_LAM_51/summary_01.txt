And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs are ordered to appear for deposition on November 15, 2024. The plaintiffs are also ordered to pay $1,310.00 in sanctions to the defendant's counsel by November 15, 2024.

The judge found that the plaintiffs had failed to meet and confer with the defendant to schedule the depositions, and that the plaintiffs had ignored the defendant's repeated requests to take their depositions. The judge also found that the plaintiffs had failed to serve a valid objection to the deposition notice and had failed to provide deposition availability to the defendant.

The judge awarded sanctions to the defendant because the plaintiffs had misused the discovery process. The judge reduced the defendant's requested amount of $1,900 to $1,310.00, which includes 2.5 hours of counsel's time at $500 per hour and a $60 motion fee.

The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.230 and 2025.450, and the Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1.3. The judge also cited several California court cases in support of their ruling.
