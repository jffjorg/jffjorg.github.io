STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On December 19, 2022, Plaintiffs Andrew Stafford and Alexa
Greger (Plaintiffs) filed a Complaint against Defendant Christine Fadley
(Defendant) with nine causes of action for: (1) Private Nuisance, (2)
Intentional Influence to Vacate, (3) Termination of Estate, Civil Code § 789.3
(4) Business and Professions Code §§ 17200, (5) Slander/Defamation, (6) Breach
of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment, (7) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith
and Fair Dealing, (8) Violation of California Civil Code § 1946.2, and (9) Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress. Plaintiffs allege that they were tenants of
the Subject Property, which was owned and/or managed by Defendant. During
Plaintiffs time at the Subject Property, Defendant locked the gate to prevent
Plaintiffs from entering. Additionally, Defendant turned off electrical power
and glued the locks shut to further prevent Plaintiffs from entering the
Subject Property. Defendant also attempted to increase Plaintiffs’ rent by 37%,
increasing it from $2,700 to $2,700, or stating that Plaintiffs have to vacate. 
 
On May 25, 2023, the court SUSTAINED Defendant’s Demurrer
as to the 5th Cause of Action, with leave to amend, and OVERRULED as to the
remaining causes of action. The court also DENIED Defendant’s Motion to Strike. 
 
On June 12, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended
Complaint (FAC) with the same causes of action as the Complaint alleged in the
caption, however, the Eighth Cause of Action states it is for Conversion of
Private Property.  
 
On November 13, 2023, the court OVERRULED Defendant’s
demurrer to the FAC and DENIED Defendant’s Motion to Strike. 
 
On December 5, 2023, Defendant filed an Answer. Defendant
also filed a Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendants Andrew Stafford and Alexa
Greger (Cross-Defendants) with five causes of action for: (1) Breach of
Contract, (2) Negligence, (3) Intentional Misrepresentation, (4) Negligent
Misrepresentation, and (5) Unjust Enrichment.  
 
On December 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Strike
Answer to Complaint. 
 
On December 20, 2023, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant also filed
a Demurrer to the Cross-Complaint. 
 
On February 13, 2024, Defendant filed a First Amended
Answer to Verified First Amended Complaint. 
 
On February 13, 2024, Defendant/Cross-Complainant filed a
First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC). 
 
On March 21, 2024, Cross-Defendants filed an Answer to the
FACC. 
 
On March 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Strike
Defendant’s Answer in its Entirety, or Alternatively, Portions of Defendant’s
Answer to Complaint which the court DENIED.
 
On May 3, 2024, Defendant filed a motion for sanctions
which the court DENIED.
 
On July 24, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to
compel depositions of Plaintiffs. Oppositions were due on or before October 18,
2024. On October 24, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an opposition. On October 29, 2024,
Defendant filed a reply.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Where a would-be
deponent fails to appear, proceed with, or produce documents for deposition in
a duly noticed deposition notice, the noticing party may move for an order to
compel said deponent’s attendance, testimony, and/or production for inspection
of any document described in the deposition notice. (Code Civ. Proc., (CCP) §§
2025.230, 2025.450 (a).)
  
ANALYSIS: 
 
Meet and Confer
 
A motion
to compel a deposition must “be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition…by
a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.” (CCP § 2025.450, subd. (2).) Plaintiffs argue that
Defendant insufficiently met and conferred because they did not schedule an IDC
with this court.
 
Here,
Defendant met the meet and confer requirement. According to the Declaration of
Nathanael Cade (Cade Decl.), Defendant attempted to coordinate taking
Plaintiffs’ depositions with Plaintiffs’ counsel numerous times between April
3, 2024 and July 12, 2024. (Cade Decl. ¶ 3.) Defendant then attempted to meet
and confer about Plaintiffs’ objections to the deposition notices Defendant did
send out. (Cade Decl. ¶¶ 6, 7.) The court is not persuaded by Plaintiffs’
argument that failing to meet and confer to schedule an IDC, in this instance,
is dispositive. Indeed, Plaintiffs note in their opposition that they “stated
they would provide Plaintiffs’ availability for deposition by the end of [May
22, 2024]” and did not do so and that Defendants had been reaching out to
Plaintiffs “but were unable to reach the Plaintiffs.” (Opp. 2:3-8.) In fact,
the court found good cause not to proceed with an IDC for the instant dispute.
(October 14, 2024 Minute Order.)
 
Accordingly,
this requirement is met.
 
Compel Deposition[1]
 
Defendant contends that Plaintiffs have ignored numerous
requests to schedule their depositions – even after stating they would provide
availability by the end of May 22, 2024. Defendant further contends that
Plaintiffs did not serve a valid objection to the deposition notice and, as
such, Defendant incurred the cost to take a Notice of Non-Appearance. Plaintiffs
do not directly address this in their opposition but seem to argue that there
is no rush to take Plaintiffs’ depositions due to the August 18, 2025 trial
date.
 
Here, Defendant is entitled to depose Plaintiffs. First, Defendant
has demonstrated that Plaintiffs have been dilatory in setting their depositions.
Second, Plaintiffs’ argument that there is no rush to take the depositions is
not well taken. Plaintiffs provide no authority supporting their contention
that a “late” trial date excuses their failure to provide deposition availability
to Defendant. The opposite is true. “A lawyer shall not intentionally,
repeatedly, recklessly or with gross negligence fail to act with reasonable
diligence in representing a client.” (Rules of Prof. Conduct, rule 1.3(a).)
This requires a lawyer “not [to] neglect or disregard, or unduly delay a legal
matter entrusted to the lawyer.” (Id.
at subd. (b).) This applies to the lawyer’s client and to the courts. (Lopez v. Larson (1979) 91 Cal.App.3d
383, 400 [discussing an attorney’s workload.]) 
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to
compel Plaintiffs’ depositions.
 
Sanctions
 
Defendant contends that sanctions are warranted because
Plaintiffs have ignored Defendant’s repeated requests to take Plaintiffs’
deposition. Defendant requests 11 hours at $500 per hour in sanctions which
includes the meet and confer time and bringing this motion. Plaintiffs argue
sanctions are not warranted.
 
A court shall impose monetary
sanctions if the motion to compel is granted unless the one subject to
sanctions acted with substantial justification or other circumstances would
make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (CCP § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)  Additionally, “[t]he
court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct.” (CCP § 2023.030(a).) 
 
The Court awards reasonable attorneys’ fees according to the
lodestar.¿ See PLCM Group v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1096; see also Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.¿ 
 
Here, sanctions are warranted.[2]
It is abundantly clear that Plaintiffs are misusing the discovery process because
it is undisputed that they have had six months to schedule their depositions
with Defendant and have failed to do so.[3]
(Cade Decl., Exhibit 1, Exhibit 5; Opp. 1:27-2:28.) However, applying the
lodestar, Defendant’s fee request is unreasonable. First, 11 hours in bringing
this straightforward motion is excessive. Second, Defendant’s request for the
Certificates of Non-Appearance is unreasonable because the deposition date was
unilaterally set, Plaintiffs served an objection indicating they would not
attend, and counsel did have a phone call wherein Defendant knew Plaintiffs did
not intend to appear on May 29, 2024 and informed Plaintiffs’ counsel that they
would proceed with the non-appearances should counsel fail to provide alternate
deposition availability. (Cade Decl., Exhibit 1.) Finally, the court is unaware
of authority allowing a sanction award encompassing meet and confer efforts that
are tangentially related to the discovery motion. As such, the court reduces
the requested amount from 11 hours to 2.5 hours at counsel’s rate of $500 per
hour as well as the $60 motion fee for the instant motion.
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Defendant’s request for
sanctions in the amount of $1,310.00.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
4.      Motion
to Compel Depositions of Plaintiffs is GRANTED;
1.      Plaintiffs
are ORDERED to appear for deposition on November 15, 2024;
2.      Plaintiffs’
counsel is  ORDERED to pay $1,310.00 in
sanctions to Defendant counsel by November 15, 2024.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
