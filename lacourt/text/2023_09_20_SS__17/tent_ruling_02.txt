WAYNE BRENT, et al. 
                           
         vs.
 
FAIROOZ KABBINAVAR, et al. 
 


 Case No.: BC691142
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  September 20, 2023



 
Defendants’
motion for a judgment on the pleadings is GRANTED, WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.  
 
On 1/24/2018,
Wayne Brent by and though his surviving spouse and successor in interest Najila
K. Brent and Najila K. Brent individually filed this action asserting 30 causes
of action. 
 
            On
10/10/2022, Plaintiffs filed an SAC, alleging: (1) wrongful death; (2) gross
negligence (3) hospital negligence; (4) professional negligence; (5) medical
negligence; (6) medical battery; (7) breach of fiduciary duty; (8) fraud; (9)
intentional infliction of emotional distress; (10) negligent infliction of
emotional distress; (11) survival action; (12) elder abuse; (13) public
entity’s liability; and (14) civil conspiracy to commit fraud, deceit, and
conceal. 
 
            Now,
Defendants Aspen Skilled Healthcare, Inc., Berkley West Convalescent Hospital
Inc. fdba Berkley West Convalescent Hospital, and Arizona & 21st
Corp. fdba Berkley Ease Convalescent Hospital (collectively, Defendants) move
for a judgment on the pleadings as to Plaintiff’s entire SAC. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendants
argue that Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to state a claim.
 
            After
review, the Court agrees. 
 
The SAC in
the entirety is vague and ambiguous with respect to the specific acts and/or
omissions attributable to each of these Defendants. The SAC asserts all causes
of action by each Plaintiff against each Defendant and repeatedly refers to the
“defendants” summarily, and pleads no facts specific to these Defendants and
provides very little information to demonstrate causation or any wrongdoing on
the part of these Defendants. As such, there are insufficient facts which could
put Defendants on notice of the what exactly each Defendant and/or their
employees allegedly did or failed to do with respect to Decedent’s care or
death. There are also serious issues of causation and standing.  
 
The Court has
identified similar defects with co-Defendants claims, and has dismissed those
claims after Plaintiff was unable to articulate any additional facts he could
allege to resolve the deficiencies. Here, not only is there no reason to
believe the deficiencies here could be resolved, but Plaintiff did not oppose
this motion. Accordingly, the Court is persuaded that leave to amend would be
futile. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendants’ motion for a judgment on the pleadings is granted, without
leave to amend. 
 
 
 
It is so ordered.

RULING
 



WAYNE BRENT, et al. 
                           
         vs.
 
FAIROOZ KABBINAVAR, et al. 
 


 Case No.: BC691142
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  September 20, 2023



 
Defendants’
motion to dismiss is GRANTED. However, the dismissal is without prejudice,
as mandated by CCP section 581, subd. (b)(4).
 
On 1/24/2018,
Wayne Brent by and though his surviving spouse and successor in interest Najila
K. Brent and Najila K. Brent individually filed this action asserting 30 causes
of action. 
 
            On
10/10/2022, Plaintiffs filed an SAC, alleging: (1) wrongful death; (2) gross
negligence (3) hospital negligence; (4) professional negligence; (5) medical
negligence; (6) medical battery; (7) breach of fiduciary duty; (8) fraud; (9)
intentional infliction of emotional distress; (10) negligent infliction of
emotional distress; (11) survival action; (12) elder abuse; (13) public
entity’s liability; and (14) civil conspiracy to commit fraud, deceit, and
conceal. 
 
Now,
Defendants Aspen Skilled Healthcare, Inc., Berkley West Convalescent Hospital
Inc. fdba Berkley West Convalescent Hospital, and Arizona & 21st
Corp. fdba Berkley Ease Convalescent Hospital (collectively, Defendants) move
to dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint. 
 
The motion is
unopposed. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendants
argue that dismissal of Plaintiff’s Complaint is mandatory based on the
five-year rule. Defendants argue that no tolling circumstances apply.
 
            After
review, the Court agrees. 
 
Plaintiff
filed the original complaint on January 24, 2018, a First Amended Complaint on
October 10, 2022, and Second Amended Complaint (SAC) on January 27, 2023. 
 
Plaintiff
waited until 2020 to file facially defective Proofs of Service of Summons
regarding some of the moving Defendants. Defaults were erroneously entered
against Defendants as Plaintiff never properly effectuated service of process
on these Defendants. These defaults were vacated on June 8, 2023.
 
Pursuant to
CCP section 583.310 “[a]n action shall be brought to trial within five years
after the action is commenced against the defendant.” An action commences when
the complaint is filed “[a]s to a defendant either expressly named in the
original complaint, or named in the original complaint by a fictitious name.” (Gray
v. Firthe (1987) 1984 Cal.App.3d 202, 209; CCP §350.) The only way to
extend the time within which an action must be brought to trial is under CCP
section 583.330 by written stipulation or by oral agreement made in open court.

 
During the
Covid-19 Pandemic, the Supreme Court of California issued Emergency Orders
regarding the tolling of matters and extensions of time in which to bring a
civil action to trial. Specifically, on April 6, 2022, Emergency Rule 10
granted a six-month extension for all civil actions filed on or before April 6,
2020. (See Emergency Rule 10, subdivision (a), “[e]xtension of five
years in which to bring a civil action to trial Notwithstanding any other law,
including Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310, for all civil actions filed
on or before April 6, 2020, the time in which to bring the action to trial is
extended by six months for a total time of five years and six months.)
 
Here,
Plaintiff filed the original complaint on January 24, 2018. Because this case
was filed before April 6, 2020, the total time in which to bring this action to
trial was five years and six months. This made the last day to bring this
matter to trial July 24, 2023. This date has since past, and no other
applicable tolling provision has been identified in this case.
 
Specific
tolling provisions are set forth in CCP section 583.340 and include as follows:

 
In computing
the time within which an action must be brought to trial pursuant to this
article, there shall be excluded the time during which any of the following
conditions existed: 
 
(a) The
jurisdiction of the court to try the action was suspended. 
 
(b)
Prosecution or trial of the action was stayed or enjoined. 
 
(c) Bringing
the action to trial, for any other reason, was impossible, impracticable, or
futile.
 
As the Court
of Appeal recognized in Moss v. Stockdale, Peckham & Werner (1996)
47 Cal.App.4th, 494, 502:
 
Reasonable
diligence places on a plaintiff the affirmative duty to make every reasonable
effort to bring a case to trial within five years, even during the last month
of its statutory life. … Time consumed by the delay caused by ordinary
incidents of proceedings, like disposition of demurrer, amendment of pleadings,
and the normal time of waiting for a place on the court’s calendar are not
within the contemplation of these exceptions. 
 
The Moss
Court further highlighted that “reasonable diligence alone is not sufficient to
protect a party from an involuntary dismissal; rather, reasonable diligence
constitutes a guideline by which to assess the existing exceptions of
impossibility, impracticability, or futility.’” (Ibid., quoting Baccus
v. Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1526, 1532.)
 
Here, there
has been no stay, and no impossibility, impracticability, or futility exits. No
stipulation for an extension has been entered. 
 
Moreover,
service of Defendants was never proper, and thus Plaintiffs failed to served
Defendant within three years of filing this action. (See CCP §
583.210(a)(1).) CCP section 583.210(a) requires a plaintiff to serve a
defendant within three years of filing the action. Failure to do so results in
a procedural end to the plaintiff’s case. (See CCP 583.250(a)(2) [“the action
shall be dismissed by the court on … motion of any person interested in the
action.”].) CCP 583.250(b) confirms the point: “the requirements of this
article are mandatory and are not subject to extension, excuse, or exception
except as expressly provided by statute.”
 
Because
Plaintiff cannot show any reasonable, excusable delay, this Court must also
dismiss this action on the ground that Plaintiff’s failure to serve Defendants
with the proscribed three year time frame amounts to a failure to prosecute.
(See CCP § 583.210(a)(1).) Plaintiff did not oppose this motion, and thus is
considered to have conceded to the merits of the motion. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendants’ motion to dismiss is granted. However, the dismissal is without
prejudice, as mandated by CCP section 581, subd. (b)(4). 
 
It is so ordered.
