         vs.
 
COUNTY
  OF LOS ANGELES 
  


 Case No.: 
  22STCV38925 
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  September 20, 2023




 
            Plaintiff’s
motion to consolidate this action with Case No. 21STCV22100 is GRANTED. 
 
On
12/15/2022, Plaintiff Johnnie Mcgee (Plaintiff) filed suit against Defendant
County of Los Angeles (County), alleging: (1) discrimination; (2) retaliation;
and (3) failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.  
 
            Now,
Plaintiff moves to consolidate this action with Case No.: 21STCV22100.
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
argues that consolidation is appropriate here because the two cases involve the
same parties, and have many overlapping issues, facts, and witnesses. 
 
            After
review, the Court agrees.
 
CCP section
1048(a) provides: "When actions involving a common question of law or fact
are pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or
all the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions
consolidated and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may
tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay."
 
Here, the
lead case, Case No. 21STCV22100 involves allegations of harassment,
discrimination, and retaliation between 2017 and June 9, 2021. The related
case, Case No. 22STCV38925, is based on allegations of acts and discriminations
which took place after June 9, 2021. As such, the two cases together represent
the full extent of alleged discrimination and harassment based on race and age
by the same employer against the same employee, and the only distinction
between the two cases is a temporal one. 

 
Accordingly,
the Court finds that consolidation serves the interest of judicial economy.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to consolidate is granted. 
 
It is so ordered.
