**English Summary:**

This tentative ruling concerns a case filed by Johnnie McGee against the County of Los Angeles. McGee alleges discrimination, retaliation, and failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. 

McGee has filed a motion to consolidate this case with a previous case (21STCV22100) involving similar allegations against the same defendant. 

The judge agrees that consolidation is appropriate because both cases involve the same parties, overlapping issues, and share a common factual basis. The judge cites CCP section 1048(a) which allows for consolidation of cases with common questions of law or fact to promote judicial economy. 

The judge finds that consolidating both cases will avoid unnecessary costs and delay and grants McGee's motion to consolidate.
