Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: a motion for judgment on the pleadings and a motion to dismiss. The Judge grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding that the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to state a claim. The Judge also grants the motion to dismiss, finding that the plaintiff failed to serve the defendants within the required three-year time frame, which constitutes a failure to prosecute. The dismissal is without prejudice, as mandated by CCP section 581, subdivision (b)(4).
