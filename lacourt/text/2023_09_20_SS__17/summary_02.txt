Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed by the defendants. The first motion is for a judgment on the pleadings, which seeks to dismiss the plaintiff's claims based on the lack of sufficient facts to state a claim. The judge grants this motion, finding that the plaintiff's complaint and second amended complaint (SAC) are vague and ambiguous and do not provide specific facts about the defendants' alleged wrongdoing. The judge also finds that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate causation and standing, and that the claims are defective and cannot be cured by leave to amend.

The second motion is to dismiss the complaint, which is based on the five-year rule that requires an action to be brought to trial within five years of the filing of the complaint. The judge grants this motion, finding that the plaintiff failed to serve the defendants within three years of filing the complaint and that there is no tolling provision that would extend the time for service. The judge also finds that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate reasonable diligence in bringing the case to trial and that the failure to serve the defendants is a failure to prosecute. The dismissal is without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff can refile the claim if it is able to correct the deficiencies identified by the judge.

##  Case Summary: 

**Case Number:** BC691142
**Plaintiffs:** Wayne Brent and Najila K. Brent 
**Defendants:** Aspen Skilled Healthcare, Inc., Berkley West Convalescent Hospital Inc., and Arizona & 21st Corp. 
**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023
**Court:** Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, Department 17
**Judge:** Hon. Jon R. Takasugi

**Summary:**

The Court has granted the Defendants' motion for a judgment on the pleadings, dismissing the Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint (SAC) without leave to amend. 

**Reasons for Dismissal:**

* **Vague and ambiguous allegations:** The SAC lacks specific details about the actions or omissions of each Defendant, making it difficult to understand the basis for the Plaintiffs' claims. The SAC repeatedly refers to "the defendants" without clearly identifying which Defendant is responsible for which alleged wrongdoing.
* **Insufficient facts:** The Plaintiffs have not provided sufficient facts to demonstrate causation or establish a cause of action against any of the Defendants.
* **Failure to serve Defendants properly:**  The Plaintiffs failed to properly serve the Defendants within the required three-year timeframe (CCP Â§ 583.210(a)(1)), leading to dismissal for failure to prosecute. 

**Additional Notes:**

* The Plaintiffs did not oppose the Defendants' motion.
* The dismissal is without prejudice, meaning the Plaintiffs may re-file their claims if they can cure the deficiencies identified by the Court.


This summary provides a concise overview of the Judge's reasoning for granting the Defendants' motion. The complete legal document contains further details and legal arguments supporting this decision.

* Hearing Date: September 20, 2023
* Department: 17, Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles

**Plaintiffs and Defendants**

* Plaintiffs: Wayne Brent, et al.
* Defendants: Fairouz Kabbinnavar, et al., including Aspen Skilled Healthcare, Inc., Berkley West Convalescent Hospital Inc., and Arizona & 21st Corp.

**Summary of Tentative Rulings**

The Court has issued two tentative rulings in this case:

1. **Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings**: The Court grants the motion, dismissing the Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (SAC) without leave to amend. The Court finds that the SAC lacks sufficient facts to state a claim against the Defendants, and that there are insufficient facts to put the Defendants on notice of the alleged wrongdoing.
2. **Motion to Dismiss**: The Court grants the motion, dismissing the Plaintiff's original complaint without prejudice. The Court finds that the Plaintiff failed to serve the Defendants within the three-year time frame required by law, and that the failure to serve the Defendants is a procedural end to the case.

**Facts and Issues**

* The Plaintiff filed the original complaint on January 24, 2018, and filed a Second Amended Complaint (SAC) on October 10, 2022.
* The Plaintiff alleged 30 causes of action, including wrongful death, gross negligence, and medical negligence.
* The Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the Plaintiff failed to serve them within the three-year time frame required by law.
* The Court found that the Plaintiff failed to show reasonable, excusable delay in serving the Defendants, and that the failure to serve the Defendants was a procedural end to the case.

**Legal Analysis**

* The Court applied California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) sections 583.310 and 583.340, which govern the time limits for bringing a civil action to trial.
* The Court found that the Plaintiff failed to bring the action to trial within the five-year time limit, and that the failure to serve the Defendants was a procedural end to the case.

**Conclusion**

The Court's tentative rulings grant the Defendants' motions, dismissing the Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (SAC) without leave to amend and the original complaint without prejudice. The Court's decisions are based on the Plaintiff's failure to plead sufficient facts to state a claim and the failure to serve the Defendants within the required time frame.
