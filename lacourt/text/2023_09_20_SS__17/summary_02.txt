Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed by the defendants. The first motion is for a judgment on the pleadings, which seeks to dismiss the plaintiff's claims based on the lack of sufficient facts to state a claim. The judge grants this motion, finding that the plaintiff's complaint and second amended complaint (SAC) are vague and ambiguous and do not provide specific facts about the defendants' alleged wrongdoing. The judge also finds that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate causation and standing, and that the claims are defective and cannot be cured by leave to amend.

The second motion is to dismiss the complaint, which is based on the five-year rule that requires an action to be brought to trial within five years of the filing of the complaint. The judge grants this motion, finding that the plaintiff failed to serve the defendants within three years of filing the complaint and that there is no tolling provision that would extend the time for service. The judge also finds that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate reasonable diligence in bringing the case to trial and that the failure to serve the defendants is a failure to prosecute. The dismissal is without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff can refile the claim if it is able to correct the deficiencies identified by the judge.
