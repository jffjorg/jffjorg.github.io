Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel an independent neurological examination of the plaintiff, Maria Fernanda Bueno Roldan. The plaintiff had alleged damages related to ongoing neurological conditions, including numbness, tingling, and radiculopathy, and the defendant argued that it was entitled to conduct discovery on this issue. The judge found that the plaintiff had placed her neurological condition in controversy and that the defendant had established good cause to order an independent neurological examination.

The judge also denied the defendant's motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant had argued that certain allegations were irrelevant, false, or improper, but the judge found that the allegations were sufficient to withstand a motion to strike at the pleading stage.

Finally, the judge denied the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's allegations of punitive damages. The defendant had argued that the allegations were not supported by sufficient specific facts, but the judge found that the allegations were sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages under California law.
