[1] Although
Defendant has met its burden to show that its actions were not unreasonable
or without proper cause as to its decisions regarding other claims, because it
did not show that all of its actions were not unreasonable or without proper
cause, Defendant has not met its burden to show that the second cause of
action, in its entirety, has no merit. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (f)(1) [“A motion for summary
adjudication shall be granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of
action . . . .”].)
