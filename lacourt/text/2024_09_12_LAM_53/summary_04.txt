And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant has moved to dismiss the complaint, alleging that it is ambiguous and unintelligible, and therefore uncertain. The judge has sustained the demurrer, ruling that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Specifically, the judge found that the complaint does not allege facts establishing that the plaintiff has a disability within the meaning of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and was denied public accommodations by the defendant because of that disability. The judge has ordered the defendant to prepare, serve, and lodge a proposed judgment of dismissal within 10 days.
