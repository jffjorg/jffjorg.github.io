  Case Number:  20VECP00075    Hearing Date:   January 10, 2025    Dept:  T 20VECP00075  IN RE NEHORAYAN The  motion is granted.  The court finds that:               (1) There exists an overriding interest that overcomes  the right of public access to the record; (2) The overriding interest supports sealing the record; (3) A substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will  be prejudiced if the record is not sealed; (4) The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) No less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest. Accordingly, the court  orders that the entire file be sealed, accesible to the petitioner and court  staff only.  Otherwise, any other person  wishing to view the file must have a prior court order.
