And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled that the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses and documents is moot, as the Defendant has finally complied with the Court's order to provide a verified code-compliant response with a privilege log. The Defendant's request for monetary sanctions of $2,250.00 is denied, as it was unsuccessful in opposing the Plaintiff's motion and caused multiple continuances of the hearing due to its failure to comply with discovery obligations. The Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions of $9,975.00 against the Defendant and its counsel, Michael Labrum, is granted. The Judge finds that the Defendant and its counsel have repeatedly abused the discovery process without substantial justification, and sanctions the amount of $7,000.00, payable to the Client Trust Account of Salomons Law Group by February 10, 2025.
