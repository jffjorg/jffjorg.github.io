Introduction 
Plaintiff Gold Projects Lindero,
Inc. (Plaintiff) moved to compel further responses and documents to Requests
for Production, Set One (RFPs) from Defendant Lordon Enterprises, Inc.
(Defendant). Plaintiff further requested monetary sanctions of $9,975.00 from
Defendant and Attorney Michael Labrum (Labrum). Defendant also requested
monetary sanctions of $2,250.00 from Plaintiff and Attorneys Gary Salomons and
Ilana Makovoz
.
Discussion
The Court initially heard
argument on Plaintiff’s motion to compel further on September 16, 2024. The
Court continued the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion until December 3, 2024.
At the next hearing on December
3, 2024, the Court ordered Defendant to provide a verified code compliant
response with a privilege log by December 16, 2024, and continued the hearing
on Plaintiff’s motion to December 20, 2024.
On December 16, 2024, Defendant
filed a declaration of Labrum attaching his verified, supplemental responses to
Defendant’s RFPs. On December 20, 2024, the Court struck Defendant’s
supplemental responses because they were not code compliant, failed to comply
with the required statutory language, and did not identify all responsive
documents even if not produced. The Court once again ordered Defendant to
provide a verified code compliant response with a privilege log by January 6,
2025, and continued the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion to January 10, 2025.
On January 7, 2025, Defendant
filed a declaration of Labrum attaching his verified, supplemental responses to
Defendant’s RFPs. Such responses are code complaint, and satisfy the Court’s
requirement to identify all responsive documents, even if not produced.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion
to compel further responses is MOOT after multiple compliance hearings.
Defendant requested monetary
sanctions of $2,250.00. Because Defendant unsuccessfully opposed Plaintiff’s
motion and caused multiple continuances of the hearing on Plaintiff’s motion
for failure to comply with its discovery obligations, Defendant’s request for
monetary sanctions is DENIED.
Plaintiff also requested monetary
sanctions of $9,975.00 from Defendant and Attorney Labrum. The Court GRANTS monetary
sanctions against defendant and his counsel Labrum, jointly and severally, and
finds a reasonable sum to be $7,000.00 for Defendant's repeated abuse of the
discovery process without substantial justification pursuant to CCP section
2023.010. These sanctions shall be made payable to the Client Trust Account of
SALOMONS LAW GROUP 4558 Sherman Oaks Avenue Sherman Oaks, CA 91403 no later
than February 10, 2025.
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE
NOTICE.
