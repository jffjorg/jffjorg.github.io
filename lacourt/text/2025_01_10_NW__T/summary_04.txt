And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Galvan v. County of LA, considering an ex parte application to continue the trial. The case has been delayed multiple times, including a 4-month delay due to the County's late filing of an answer. The court notes that both sides failed to comply with the court's order for mediation before a designated cutoff. Despite Mr. Berman's health issues, the court believes that another experienced attorney at his firm, such as Alex Sarajian or Eduardo Brito, could try the case. The court is inclined to continue the trial for 4 months, but will not extend the discovery cutoff. The court also requires the parties to complete mediation if not already done.
