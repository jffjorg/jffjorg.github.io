 Case Number:  23VECV02914    Hearing Date:   January 10, 2025    Dept:  T 23VECV02914
Galvan v County of LA
Ex parte
application to continue trial:
This case
has previously been continued for 4 months.  The case was delayed at the outset because it
was not until 5 months after filing that the answer was filed.  Both sides failed to comply with the court’s
order for mediation before a designated cutoff.  The case is already 18 months old and is out of compliance with the time standards for an IC case under the CRC.
While
empathetic to Mr. Berman’s health issues, at no time does Mr. Berman indicate
that there is no one else at his firm who can try this case.  Indeed, the complaint lists Alex Sarajian SBN
229436 and Eduardo Brito SBN 157933 as attorneys on this case, both with years more
experience than Mr. Berman.  Why can’t
one of these lawyers try the case?
Second, the
court may be inclined to continue the trial for 4 months as there is no reason
why another experienced attorney cannot get the case ready for trial.  This is a car accident case with under
$15,000 in medicals.
Even if
continued, the court will not extend the discovery cutoff which is set to expire
30 days before 2/24/2024 as there is no good cause to do so.
Finally, the court will require that the parties complete mediation if
not already done.
