And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Nehorayan, granting the motion to seal the record. The court finds that there is an overriding interest that outweighs the public's right to access the record. The judge concludes that sealing the record is necessary to protect this interest, and that no less restrictive means exist to achieve this goal. The record will be sealed, accessible only to the petitioner and court staff, with prior court approval required for anyone else to view the file.
