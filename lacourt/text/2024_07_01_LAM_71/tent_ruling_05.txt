RUBEN ISIDORO SANCHEZ,  
  
         vs.
 
CARLOS GONZALEZ, et al.


 Case No.: 
  24STCV00417
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  July 1, 2024



 
Specially
Appearing Defendant in pro per Carlos Gonzalez’s unopposed motion
to quash service of summons is granted. 
 
Specially
Appearing Defendant Carlos Gonzalez (“Gonzalez”) (“Moving Defendant”), in pro
per, makes a special appearance for this Court to quash service of the
summons and complaint in this action on the grounds Plaintiff Ruben Isidoro
Sanchez (“Sanchez”) (“Plaintiff”) has failed to properly serve Moving Defendant,
and instead served Moving Defendant’s healthcare provider at the front door as
she was attempting to enter Moving Defendant’s residence.  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §418.10.)
 
Background
On
January 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative Complaint against Moving
Defendant and Non-moving Defendant Nicholas Cabrera (“Cabrera”) (collectively,
“Defendants”).  On January 31, 2024, at
8:53 AM, Plaintiff served Moving Defendant with the summons and Complaint at
712 Calle Miramar, Redondo Beach, CA 90277 (“Property”) by substituted service
on Jane Doe, indicating that she lives with the subject at the residence and
accepted the paperwork.  (2/5/24 Proof of
Service.)  Plaintiff filed a proof of
service for the Complaint on February 5, 2024, indicating that he served Moving
Defendant by substituted service.
On
February 16, 2024, Moving Defendant filed the instant motion.  As of the date of this hearing Plaintiff has
not filed an opposition.
 
Motion
to Quash
“A defendant, on or before
the day of his or her time to plead . . . may serve and file a notice of motion
. . . [t]o quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of
the court over him or her.”  (C.C.P.
§418.10(a)(1).)  By filing such motion,
“a defendant makes a special appearance for the narrow purpose of contesting
personal jurisdiction where the summons is defective.”  (Stancil v. Superior Court (2021) 11
Cal.5th 381, 393.)
“California is a jurisdiction
which in general requires strict statutory compliance with requirements for
service of original process.”  (In re
Abrams (1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 685, 693-694.) 
“Until statutory requirements are satisfied, the Court lacks
jurisdiction over a defendant.”  (Ruttenberg
v. Ruttenberg (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 801, 809.)
“In the absence of a
voluntary submission to the authority of the court, compliance with the
statutes governing service of process is essential to establish that court’s
personal jurisdiction over a defendant.”  (Floveyer International, Ltd. v. Superior
Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 789, 793; see also Calvert v. Al Binali
(2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 954, 961 [“To establish personal jurisdiction, it is essential
to comply with the statutory procedures for service of process.”].) “When a
defendant challenges that jurisdiction by bringing a motion to quash, the
burden is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving,
inter alia, the facts requisite to an effective service.”  (Lebel v. Mai (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th
1154, 1160, internal quotations omitted.)
C.C.P. §415.20(b) provides:
If a copy of the summons and
complaint cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered to the
person to be served, as specified in Section 416.60, 416.70, 416.80, or 416.90,
a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at
the person’s dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business,
or usual mailing address other than a United States Postal Service post office
box, in the presence of a competent member of the household or a person
apparently in charge of his or her office, place of business, or usual mailing
address other than a United States Postal Service post office box, at least 18
years of age, who shall be informed of the contents thereof, and by thereafter
mailing a copy of the summons and of the complaint by first-class mail, postage
prepaid to the person to be served at the place where a copy of the summons and
complaint were left. Service of a summons in this manner is deemed complete on
the 10th day after the mailing.  
 
(C.C.P. §415.20(b),
emphasis added.)
Here, Plaintiff failed to
meet his burden to demonstrate he served the summons and complaint in the
presence of a competent member of Moving Defendant’s household.  
Furthermore, the individual,
“Jane Doe,” who was substituted served does not meet the definition of a
competent member of Moving Defendant’s household under C.C.P. §415.20(b).  Moving Defendant submitted the declaration of
Fatima Arango (“Arango”), who provides healthcare and support for Moving
Defendant.  (Decl. of Arango ¶3.)  Arango declares that upon her arrival at the Property
on January 31, 2024, an individual asked her if she lived at the Property, and
she informed them that she did not.  (Decl.
of Arango ¶4.)  Arango
declares that despite informing the individual that she did not live at the
Property, they handed Arango paperwork when she was at the front door ringing
the Property’s doorbell.  (Decl.
of Arango ¶5.)  Arango
declares the individual that served her with the paperwork never gained access
to the Property to attempt to personally serve Moving Defendant because he is
disabled and could not come to the door because he was being cared for by his
wife in the back room of the Property.  (Decl. of Arango ¶6.)  Arango does not meet the requirement of competent
member of Moving Defendant’s household. Therefore, Plaintiff’s purported
service is ineffectual as to Moving Defendant. 
Accordingly, Moving
Defendant’s unopposed motion to quash is granted.
 
Conclusion
Moving Defendant’s unopposed
motion to quash service of summons is granted.
Moving Party to give
notice.
