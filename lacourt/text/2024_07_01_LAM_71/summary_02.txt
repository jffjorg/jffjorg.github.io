**Significant Statements**

* "The public policy in favor of arbitration is so strong that California courts have held that an employee is 'bound by the provisions of the [arbitration] agreement regardless of whether [he] read it or [was] aware of the arbitration clause when [he] signed the document.'" (Brookwood v. Bank of America)
* "Arbitration must be ordered 'unless the agreement clearly does not apply to the dispute in question.'" (Vianna v. Doctors' Management Co.)
* "The Court cannot determine which role Medina assumed wherein she actually would have explained arbitrations agreements because she asserted that she did so in both roles."
