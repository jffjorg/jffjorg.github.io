The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment. Instead, the court has set a hearing to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or the plaintiff's counsel should be sanctioned. The hearing is scheduled for July 1, 2024, at 8:30 AM. The court's decision is based on the fact that the request for default judgment does not properly seek an amount equal to or less than the amount sought in the complaint, and the prayer of the complaint does not specify the amount demanded. The court cites California Rule of Court, rule 3.110(h), California Code of Civil Procedure (C.C.P.) ยง425.11, and Falahati v. Kondo (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 823, 830-831, in support of its decision.
