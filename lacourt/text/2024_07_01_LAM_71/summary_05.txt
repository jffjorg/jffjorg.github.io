And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's unopposed motion to quash service of summons and complaint. The defendant, Carlos Gonzalez, was served at his residence by a healthcare provider, Fatima Arango, who does not meet the definition of a competent member of the household under California Code of Civil Procedure (C.C.P.) §415.20(b). The plaintiff, Ruben Isidoro Sanchez, failed to demonstrate that the summons and complaint were served in the presence of a competent member of the household. As a result, the service is ineffectual, and the court lacks jurisdiction over the defendant. The motion to quash is granted, and the plaintiff is required to give notice of the ruling.
