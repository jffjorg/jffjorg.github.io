[1] The Court notes the paragraph numbers in the Declaration
of Azucena Crespo are out of order and include two separate
paragraphs numbered as ¶5.  To avoid
confusion, the ¶5 cited to by the Court is on page 18:15-17.  The Court reminds counsel to proofread her
filings, particularly because this is the second time the Declaration of Azucena
Crespo has been filed with this Court and the same problem appears to have been
ignored by counsel.
