Center [erroneously sued as RRT Enterprises L.P.] (“Country Villa”),
Pursue Health, LLC (“Pursue Health”), and Shlomo Rechnitz (“Rechnitz”)

           Background
On July 21, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed the operative Complaint in the instant action against Defendants alleging
four causes of action: (1) Elder Abuse and Neglect (Welfare and Institutions
Code §15600 et seq.); (2) Negligence; (3) Violation of Resident’s Bill of
Rights (Health & Safety Code §1430); and (4) Wrongful Death (Code of Civil Procedure
§377.60).  Plaintiffs’ causes of action
stem from Jacquelyn’s admission to Country Villa (“Facility”) on September 20,
2022.  (Complaint ¶30.)
On February 20, 2024, this
Court denied Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration.  (See 2/20/24 Minute Order.)
On March 20, 2024, Defendants
filed the instant motion.  Plaintiffs
filed an opposition on June 17, 2024. 
Defendants filed their reply June 24, 2024.
           
Motion to Compel Arbitration
1.   
Enforceability
of the Arbitration Agreement
Federal
law provides for enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. The Federal
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1, et seq. (“FAA”), establishes a strong
federal policy in favor of arbitration of disputes where a written arbitration
agreement exists. Section 2 of the FAA provides, in pertinent part that “[a]
written provision . . . to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter
arising out of such contract . . .  shall
be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable.”  (9 U.S.C. §2.) 
The purpose of the FAA is to “reverse the longstanding judicial
hostility to arbitration agreements.” (Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane
Corp. (1991) 500 U.S. 20, 24.)  The
FAA places arbitration agreements “on an equal footing with other contracts and
[requires courts] to enforce them according to their terms.”  (AT&T Mobility, LLC v. Concepcion (2011)
563 U.S. 333, 339; see also Rent-A-Center West, Inc. v. Jackson (2010)
561 U.S. 63, 67 [“The FAA reflects the fundamental principle that arbitration
is a matter of contract.”].)  The FAA
will preempt not only a state law that “discriminat[es] on its face against
arbitration,” but also a state law that “covertly accomplishes the same
objective by disfavoring contracts that (oh so coincidentally) have the
defining features of arbitration agreements.”  (Kindred Nursing Centers Limited
Partnership v. Clark (2017) 137 S.Ct. 1421, 1426.)
The
FAA provides that a “written provision in . . . a contract evidencing a
transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy
thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction . . . shall be valid,
irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in
equity for the revocation of any contract.”  (9 U.S.C. § 2).  Indeed, the U.S. Supreme Court has stated that
the phrase “involving commerce” “cover[s] more than ‘only persons or activities
within the flow of interstate commerce,’” but is rather the “functional
equivalent of the phrase ‘affecting commerce,’” which signals “Congress’ intent
to exercise its commerce power to the full.”  (See Allied-Bruce Terminix Companies, Inc.
v. Dobson (1995) 513 U.S. 265, 268, 274, citing United States v.
American Building Maintenance Industries (1975) 422 U.S. 271, 276).  In legislating and passing the FAA, Congress
intended for any matter that “affects commerce” to be settled by arbitration
when the parties have contracted to be bound by such agreements.  (See id.)
The
FAA restricts a court’s inquiry related to compelling arbitration to two
threshold questions: (1) whether there was an agreement to arbitrate between
the parties; and (2) whether the agreement covers the dispute.  (Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. (2002)
537 U.S. 79, 84.)  Here, both criteria
are satisfied. First, Jacquelyn agreed to arbitration when she entered into the
Arbitration Agreement (“Agreement”) that contained the relevant arbitration
clause.  (Decl. of Crespo ¶¶3, 5, Exhs. 2-3.) [1]  Second, the Agreement expressly covers “any dispute as to medical malpractice,
that is as to whether any medical services rendered under this contract were
unnecessary or unauthorized or were improperly, negligently or incompetently rendered
or not rendered” between Jacquelyn and Country Villa and “any and all other
disputes, controversies, demands or claims that relate or arise out of the
provision of services or health care or any failure to provide services or
health care by Facility.”  (Decl. of
Crespo ¶3, Exh. 2 at §§1.1-1.2.)  
California
law also favors arbitration for dispute resolution. The California Arbitration
Act (“CAA”), codified at C.C.P. §1281 et seq., provides, “A written
agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy
thereafter arising is valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such
grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.”  (C.C.P. §1281; see also Grafton Partners
L.P. v. Superior Court (2005) 36 Cal.4th 944, 955 [“[U]nlike predispute
jury waivers, predispute arbitration agreements are specifically authorized by
statute.”].)  
“California
law, like federal law, favors enforcement of valid arbitration agreements.”  (Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare
Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 97, 99.)  The public policy in favor of arbitration is
so strong that California courts have held that an employee is “bound by the
provisions of the [arbitration] agreement regardless of whether [he] read it or
[was] aware of the arbitration clause when [he] signed the document.”  (Brookwood v. Bank of America (1996)
45 Cal.App.4th 1667, citing Macaulay v. Norlander (1992) 12 Cal.App.4th
1.)  The only prerequisite for a court to
order arbitration is a determination that the parties have entered into an
agreement to arbitrate the dispute.  (United
Transportation Union v. Southern California Rapid Transit District (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 804, 808.)  Thus, arbitration
must be ordered “unless the agreement clearly does not apply to the dispute in
question.”  (Vianna v. Doctors’
Management Co. (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 1186, 1189.)
Defendants submitted evidence that on October
21, 2022, Jacquelyn signed the Agreement. 
(Decl. of Crespo ¶3, Exh. 2.)  Pursuant to C.C.P. §1281.2, Defendants
demonstrated Plaintiff sent correspondence to Defendants on September 20, 2023,
offering to stipulate to arbitration with terms and conditions outside of the
terms and conditions detailed in the Agreement. 
(Decl. of Crespo ¶4, Exh. 4.)  However,
Defendants failed to demonstrate they made a formal demand for arbitration on
October 5, 2023, because they failed to attach Exhibit 6, the document
detailing the existence of a binding arbitration agreement.  (See Decl. of Crespo ¶6, Exh. 6.)  Nevertheless, Defendants therefore shift the
burden to Plaintiffs to challenge the authenticity of the agreement.  (Gamboa v. Northeast Community Clinic
(2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 158, 165.)
Plaintiffs’ arguments regarding the authenticity
of the Agreement are well taken.  Here,
Defendants presented an alleged arbitration agreement and again failed to lay
proper foundation that it is what it purports to be since it is riddled with
unreliable assertions.  First, Defendants
provided the declaration of an admissions coordinator who has offered two
different stories while under penalty of perjury.  Dalia Medina originally stated under penalty
of perjury that she was in the role of admissions coordinator from June 2020 to
June 2021, and in that role, she would review and explain arbitration
agreements to patients during the admission paperwork process.  (Decl. of Crespo ¶3, Exh. 3 at ¶¶2-3.)  However, in an additional declaration
submitted by Dalia Medina, she declares that she has been the admissions
director since August 12, 2022, and she has the same responsibility for
explaining arbitration agreements as she originally claimed she had as an
admissions coordinator.  (Decl. of Medina
¶¶2-3.)  The Court cannot determine which
role Medina assumed wherein she actually would have explained arbitrations
agreements because she asserted that she did so in both roles.  Further, this is a significant discrepancy in
the event she was not the admissions coordinator at the time that Jacquelyn was
admitted.  If Medina explained
arbitration agreements as admissions coordinator, then she lacks foundation
since she was not in that role when Jacquelyn was admitted.  If Medina did not explain arbitration
agreements when she was admissions coordinator and instead does that as
admissions director, then the declarant previously perjured herself. 
Second, Medina’s assertions regarding the
alleged execution of the agreement differ substantially from her previous
assertions.  Initially, she claimed she
explained the admission packet to Jacquelyn and had Jacquelyn sign the
admission packet on October 21, 2022.  Then
after Medina was confronted with the actual signature dates, she declared she
actually had Jacquelyn sign the admission agreement on November 1, 2022.  These assertions lack credibility since they
were both made under penalty of perjury yet have key substantive differences.
Finally, like the situation in Fabian v.
Renovate America, Inc. (2019) 42 Cal.App.5th 1062, 1069, the declaration of
Medina provides no specific details regarding Defendants’ security protocols which
would ensure that the electronic signature could have only been made by Jacquelyn
or the time the Agreement was executed.
Based on the foregoing, Defendants did not
meet their burden to prove the existence of a valid Agreement that is
enforceable by Defendants.

motion to compel arbitration is denied.
