TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION - SET ONE ADMITTED and COMPEL RESPONSES TO FORM

INTRODUCTION
This is a sexual assault action brought by Plaintiff Jane Doe 8004
(“Plaintiff”) against Defendant Ron Thorn (“Defendant”). On February 24, 2023,
Plaintiff filed this action asserting claims for (1) Sexual Assault, (2) Sexual
Battery, and (3) Gender Violence. Defendant filed an answer to the complaint on
September 15, 2023.
During discovery, Defendant served Plaintiff with four discovery
requests: 1) Requests for Admission- Set One; 2) Form Interrogatories - Set Two
3) Special Interrogatories - Set Two and 4) Requests for Admission- Set One.
Defendant has filed four motions to compel Plaintiff to serve verified
responses and produce documents and seeks monetary sanctions for a total of
$10,958.36. The Court will address these motions in one tentative ruling as
follows:
            II.        REQUESTS
FOR ADMISSIONS – RFA Set One
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by a written request that any other
party to the action admit the genuineness of specified documents, or the truth
of specified matters of fact, opinion relating to fact, or application of law
to fact. A request for admission may relate to a matter that is in controversy
between the parties.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.010.)¿ “Within 30 days after
service of requests for admission, the party to whom the requests are directed
shall serve the original of the response to them on the requesting party, and a
copy of the response on all other parties who have appeared . . . .”¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.250(a).)  
If a party to whom request for admissions are served fails to provide a
timely response, the party to whom the request was directed waives any
objections, including based on privilege or the work product doctrine. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(a).) The requesting party can move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
request be deemed admitted, as well as for monetary sanctions. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280(b).) The court shall issue this order unless the party to
whom the request was made serves a response in substantial compliance prior to
the hearing on the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).) 
It is well-settled that “unsworn responses are tantamount to no responses
at all.”  (Appleton v. Superior Court (1888) 206 Cal.App.3d 632,
636; Zorro Inv. Co. v. Great Pacific Securities Corp. (1977) 69
Cal.App.3d 907, 914.)   
Defendant served RFAs - Set One on Plaintiff on September 24, 2024, with
responses due by October 28, 2024. Plaintiff’s former counsel requested a
one-week extension, extending the deadline to November 4, 2024. (Gutierrez
Decl., ¶¶ 2-4; Exh. A.) Despite this extension and further correspondence,
Plaintiff failed to serve any responses. Defense counsel sent a meet-and-confer
letter on November 5, 2024, offering an additional courtesy extension to
November 12, 2024, but Plaintiff did not respond. (Gutierrez Decl., ¶¶ 7-9;
Exh. B.)
As of the date of this motion, Plaintiff has not served verified
responses. Plaintiff’s failure to participate in discovery obstructs the
litigation process and violates her statutory obligations. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.220.)
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280(b), if a party fails to
serve timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order that the
matters specified in the RFAs be deemed admitted. The court must grant this
motion unless verified responses are served before the hearing.
Because no verified responses have been filed as of the date of the
hearing, Defendant’s motion to deem the RFAs admitted must be granted.
Accordingly, Defendant’s request to deem the RFAs admitted is GRANTED.
 
III.  INTERROGATORIES – Form Interrogatories– Set Two
and Special Interrogatories – Set Two,
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290(a), if a party fails to
respond to interrogatories, they waive any objections, including those based on
privilege or work product protection. When a party does not provide timely
responses, the propounding party is entitled to move for an order compelling
responses. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290(b), the Court
must order the responding party to provide responses without objections.
Here, on September 24,
2024, Defendant served Form Interrogatories – Set Two and Special
Interrogatories - Set Two, on Plaintiff, with responses due by October 28,
2024. (Gutierrez Decl., ¶ 2; Exh. A.) Plaintiff’s former counsel requested and
received a one-week extension, making the new deadline November 4, 2024.
(Gutierrez Decl., ¶ 4.) However, Plaintiff failed to serve responses by the
extended deadline. Defense counsel sent a meet-and-confer letter on November 5,
2024, granting Plaintiff a final extension to November 12, 2024, but Plaintiff
again failed to respond. (Gutierrez Decl., ¶ 7; Exh. B.) As of the filing date
of this motion, Plaintiff has not served any responses, and thus the motion to
compel responses without objections is appropriate.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS
Defendants motion to compel Form Interrogatories - Set Two and Special
Interrogatories - Set Two.
 
IV.       REQUEST
FOR PRODUCTION – Request for Production - Set Three
A propounding party may move to compel responses to requests for
production of documents where the responding party fails to provide responses.
(CCP § 2031.300.) The responding party must provide responses within thirty
days after the demand is served. (CCP § 2031.030(c)(2) & (3).) The
responding party waives all objections, including privilege and work product,
by failing to timely respond to requests for production of documents. (CCP §
2031.300.) 
Defendant served Requests for Production - Set Three, on September 24,
2024, making responses due on or about October 28, 2024. (Gutierrez Decl., ¶ 2;
Exh. A.) Plaintiff’s former counsel requested and received a one-week
extension, moving the deadline to November 4, 2024. (Gutierrez Decl., ¶ 4.) On
November 5, 2024, after receiving no responses, defense counsel sent a
meet-and-confer letter granting a final extension to November 12, 2024.
(Gutierrez Decl., ¶¶ 6-7; Exh. B.) Plaintiff, now self-represented, has failed
to respond as of the filing of this motion.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendants motion to compel Request for
Production – Set Three.
V.        SANCTIONS
Sanctions are mandatory against the party, the attorney, or both whose
failure to serve a timely response to the request necessitated the motion to
deem request for admissions as admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c); see
also Cal. Rules of Court R. 3.1348(a) [the court can award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party seeking to compel discovery even though
no opposition was filed, the opposition was withdrawn, or the requested
discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed].) 
CCP § 2023.030 authorizes the Court to issue sanctions against a party
engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process. Failure to
respond to discovery, evasive responses, and objections lacking substantial
justification are “misuses of the discovery process.” (CCP § 2023.010, subd.
(d)-(f).) 
In this case, Plaintiff failed to provide timely, verified responses to
1) Requests for Admission- Set One; 2) Form Interrogatories - Set Two 3)
Special Interrogatories - Set Two and 4) Requests for Admission- Set One.
Despite multiple meet-and-confer efforts, Plaintiff has neither remedied these
deficiencies nor provided any substantial justification for failing to do so.
As a result, Defendant filed four motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses and
requested monetary sanctions for each motion.
Defendant’s counsel seeks the following monetary sanctions: 1) $2,315.84
for Requests for Admission - Set One, reflecting 8.65 hours at $250 per hour
for attorney work, 0.4 hours at $150 per hour for paralegal work, and a $93.34
filing fee; 2)  $2,183.34 for Form Interrogatories - Set Two, reflecting
8.12 hours at $250 per hour for attorney work, 0.4 hours at $150 per hour for
paralegal work, and a $93.34 filing fee; 3) 2,238.34 for Special
Interrogatories - Set Two, reflecting 8.34 hours at $250 per hour for attorney
work, 0.4 hours at $150 per hour for paralegal work, and a $93.34 filing fee;
4) $4,220.84 for Requests for Production - Set Three, reflecting 14.59 hours at
$250 per hour for attorney work, 0.5 hours at $600 per hour for senior attorney
review, 1.2 hours at $150 per hour for paralegal work, and a $93.34 filing fee.
The total sanctions requested amount to $10,958.36.
After reviewing the complexity of these motions and noting that no
opposition has been filed, the Court finds the requested sanctions excessive.
These motions are straightforward and all will be heard together. The Court
concludes that awarding full sanctions for each motion is unnecessary. Instead,
the Court awards reduced sanctions as follows: 6 total hours across all motions
for attorney work at $250 per hour ($1,500), 1.6 total hours for paralegal work
at $150 per hour ($240), and $93.34 in filing fees for each motion, totaling
$373.36.
Accordingly, the Court awards a total monetary sanction against Plaintiff
in the amount of $2,113.36.
VI.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 Motion by Defendant to deem Requests for
Admission, Set One, admitted, and Motion to Compel responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set Two; Special Interrogatories, Set Two; and  Requests for Production, Set Three, are
GRANTED.
Motion by Defendant for compelling
monetary sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $2,113.36. 
Plaintiff is ordered to provide
responses and pay sanctions within 20 days.
Defendant is ordered to provide
notice of this order.
