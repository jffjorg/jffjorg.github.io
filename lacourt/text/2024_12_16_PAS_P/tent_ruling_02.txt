 Case Number:  23AHCV01742    Hearing Date:   December 16, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT STATE
FARM’S MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDERI.          INTRODUCTION
This action arises from an automobile accident that occurred on or about April
30, 2020. On July 31, 2023, Plaintiffs Lawanda Jackson, Kayzah Jackson, and
Kaylah Jackson filed a Complaint against Defendant State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance (“State Farm”) and State Farm General Insurance Company alleging
causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Breach of the Covenant of
Good Faith and Fair Dealing; and (3) Fraud.
On August 16, 2023, Plaintiffs Lawanda Jackson and Kayzah Jackson
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed a Motion to Compel Arbitration.
Subsequently, on December 5, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the operative First Amended
Complaint against Defendants State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance and State
Farm General Insurance Company, again alleging causes of action for: (1) Breach
of Contract; (2) Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; and (3)
Fraud.
On March 29, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ Motion to Compel
Arbitration. On June 14, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ Motion for
Reconsideration of that ruling.
On August 28, 2024, State Farm filed a Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings, which remains pending. On November 14, 2024, State Farm filed the
instant Motion for Protective Order. Plaintiffs filed their Opposition on
November 27, 2024, and State Farm filed its Reply on December 6, 2024.
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
CCP section 2017.020 provides that
“[t]he court shall limit the scope of discovery if it determines that the
burden, expense, or intrusiveness of that discovery clearly outweighs the
likelihood that the information sought will lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2017.020(a).)  “The court may make
this determination pursuant to a motion for protective order by a party or
other affected person.”  (Id.)  
            A
responding party may move for a protective order with respect to
interrogatories, requests for production of documents, requests for admissions,
and depositions and a court may make any order that justice requires to protect
a party from “unwanted annoyance, embarrassment or oppression or undue burden
and expense.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.420, 2030.090, 2031.060,
2033.080.)  The burden of proof is on the party seeking the protective
order to show “good cause” for the order he or she seeks.  (Fairmont
Insurance Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.) 
            “In
accordance with the liberal policies underlying the discovery procedures,
California courts have been broad-minded in determining whether discovery is
reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence. (Pacific Tel. &
Tel. Co. v. Superior Court (1970) 2 Cal.3d 161, 172; Pettie v. Superior
Court (1960) 178 Cal.App.2d 680, 687.) As a practical matter, it is
difficult to define at the discovery stage what evidence will be relevant at
trial. Therefore, the party seeking discovery is entitled to substantial
leeway. (Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co., supra, 2 Cal.3d at p. 172.)
Furthermore, California’s liberal approach to permissible discovery generally
has led the courts to resolve any doubt in favor of permitting discovery. (Id.
at p. 173.) In doing so, the courts have taken the view if an error is made in
ruling on a discovery motion, it is better that it be made in favor of granting
discovery of the nondiscoverable rather than denying discovery of information
vital to preparation or presentation of the party's case or to efficacious
settlement of the dispute.” (Norton v. Superior Court (1994) 24
Cal.App.4th 1750, 1761.) 
III.      ANALYSIS
State Farm moves for a protective
order pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.420, contending that
requiring its claims handler, Trish Kero, and counsel, Richard Knapp, to sit
for depositions and produce documents would impose undue burden, annoyance, and
expense. State Farm asserts that the information sought in these depositions is
irrelevant to the pending motion for judgment on the pleadings, which is
scheduled for hearing on January 31, 2025. (Motion, p.10)
State Farm filed its motion for
judgment on the pleadings to resolve the case on the grounds that Plaintiffs
failed to timely demand arbitration, as required by their insurance policy and
Insurance Code section 11580.2. This failure, State Farm argues, which was the
basis for the Court’s denial of Plaintiffs’ prior motion to compel arbitration
and motion for reconsideration, bars Plaintiffs’ claims as a matter of law.
According to State Farm, these prior rulings constitute an adjudication on the
merits of Plaintiffs’ claims because the statute of limitations for demanding
arbitration is a condition precedent to any cause of action arising under the
policy. Consequently, State Farm contends that the requested depositions are
unnecessary and would not impact the pending motion. (Motion, pp 9-10, Reply,
p.2)
Given this, State Farm argues that
the protective order is necessary to shield it from the undue burden,
annoyance, and expense of conducting depositions. State Farm further contends
that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated good cause to proceed with the depositions
at this stage and emphasizes that, even if the motion for judgment on the
pleadings is denied, Plaintiffs can seek to take these depositions at a later
time, preserving the parties’ resources and preventing unnecessary costs
(Reply, p. 3)
In opposition, Plaintiff argues
that a protective order should be denied. Plaintiffs argue that the depositions
of Trish Kero and Richard Knapp are necessary to gather evidence supporting
their claims of bad faith and fraud, particularly regarding representations
allegedly made by Defendant’s agents about extending the arbitration deadline.
Plaintiffs assert that both Ms. Kero and Mr. Knapp submitted declarations in
opposition to prior motions, which Plaintiffs contend contained false or
misleading statements regarding the need for a certified arbitration demand and
the applicable statute of limitations. (Opposition, pp. 3-4) 
Plaintiffs further contend that
these depositions are critical to rebut Defendant’s motion for judgment on the
pleadings, as the testimony of Ms. Kero and Mr. Knapp would address key factual
disputes about whether Plaintiffs were misled into believing the arbitration
deadline had been extended. Plaintiffs argue that their inability to depose
these witnesses prior to opposing the motion for judgment on the pleadings
would result in significant prejudice, as the depositions are likely to produce
evidence directly relevant to their claims and defenses. (Opposition, p.5)
State Farm responds that the Court
has already rejected Plaintiffs’ motion to compel arbitration and motion for
reconsideration, determining that Plaintiffs failed to comply with the statute
of limitations. State Farm contends these rulings constitute an adjudication on
the merits, rendering the requested depositions irrelevant and unnecessary
(Reply, p. 3¿)
The Court finds that State Farm has
demonstrated good cause for a protective order under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2025.420. The Court previously denied Plaintiffs’ motion to compel
arbitration and motion for reconsideration, finding that Plaintiffs failed to
timely demand arbitration as required by the insurance policy and Insurance
Code section 11580.2. In the motion for reconsideration, the Court specifically
determined that the declarations cited by Plaintiffs did not provide new or
different facts, circumstances, or law sufficient to justify reconsideration.
(6/14/24 Minute Order) However, the Court makes no determination at this time
as to whether those rulings constitute an adjudication on the merits, as that
issue is not presently before the Court.
The Court further finds that the requested depositions of
Ms. Kero and Mr. Knapp are unlikely to yield evidence relevant to Defendant’s
pending motion for judgment on the pleadings, which is based on Plaintiffs’
failure to meet procedural prerequisites under the insurance policy.
Balancing the potential burden,
annoyance, and expense of proceeding with these depositions and production of
documents against their relevance at this stage, the Court concludes that a
protective order is warranted. Given that trial is set for February 17, 2026,
Plaintiffs retain the ability to re-notice the depositions should the motion
for judgment on the pleadings be denied, with no prejudice to raising any
future discovery issues at that time.
Accordingly, the Court grants
Defendant’s motion for a protective order, staying the depositions of Ms. Kero
and Mr. Knapp and any related document production until after the resolution of
the motion for judgment on the pleadings.
