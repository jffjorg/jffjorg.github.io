And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for relief from deemed admissions. The case involves a premises liability and negligence action brought by the plaintiff, Collean Taylor-Drennen, against defendants HSR San Pasqual, LP, Bob Daignault, and Joseph Penner. The plaintiff claims that she suffered injuries caused by an overgrown tree branch on the defendants' property, which extended into a public sidewalk.

The plaintiff's prior counsel failed to serve timely responses to the defendants' request for admission, resulting in the deemed admissions. The plaintiff filed a motion for relief from the deemed admissions, citing inadvertence, mistake, and excusable neglect due to staff turnover and procedural errors. The defendants opposed the motion, arguing that the plaintiff failed to establish excusable neglect and that relief would result in substantial prejudice.

The judge found that the plaintiff has demonstrated excusable neglect and that the defendants will not suffer substantial prejudice if relief is granted. The judge concluded that granting relief is appropriate under California Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.300, which favors resolution of cases on their merits. The judge granted the plaintiff's motion for relief from deemed admissions.
