```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants State Farm's motion for a protective order, staying the depositions of Trish Kero and Richard Knapp and any related document production until after the resolution of State Farm's pending motion for judgment on the pleadings. The court finds that State Farm has demonstrated good cause for the protective order, as the depositions are unlikely to yield evidence relevant to State Farm's motion. The court balances the potential burden, annoyance, and expense of proceeding with the depositions against their relevance at this stage and concludes that a protective order is warranted.
