 Case Number:  23AHCV02873    Hearing Date:   December 16, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION
BY PLAINTIFF FOR RELIEF FROM ADMISSIONS DEEMED ADMITTEDI.          INTRODUCTION
This is a premises liability and
negligence action. Plaintiff, Collean Taylor-Drennen (“Plaintiff”), brought
this action on December 12, 2023, against Defendants HSR San Pasqual, LP, Bob
Daignault, and Joseph Penner, alleging causes of action for (1) Negligence and
(2) Premises Liability. Plaintiff contends that on January 28, 2023, she
suffered injuries caused by an overgrown tree branch on Defendants’ property,
which extended into a public sidewalk.
On July 31, 2024, the Court granted
Defendant Joseph Penner and HSR San Pasqual, LP (collectively, “Defendants”)
motion to deem admitted Request for Admission, Set One, due to Plaintiff’s
failure to serve timely responses. Plaintiff’s initial responses, served on
July 24, 2024, were on an incorrect pleading template from a dismissed case,
resulting in procedural defects. Plaintiff filed the instant motion for relief
from deemed admissions on October 11, 2024, citing inadvertence, mistake, and
excusable neglect due to staff turnover in Plaintiff’s prior counsel’s office.
On November 27, 2024, Defendants
filed an opposition, arguing that Plaintiff failed to establish excusable
neglect and that relief would result in substantial prejudice. Plaintiff filed
a reply on December 9, 2024.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
A party may withdraw or amend an
admission made in response to a request for admission only on leave of court
granted after notice to all parties. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.300, subd. (a).)
The court may permit the withdrawal only if it determines the admission was the
result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and the party who
obtained the admission will not be substantially prejudiced in maintaining that
party’s action or defense on the merits.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.300,
subd. (b).) The “mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect” under CCP §
2033.300 have similar meanings as those words used in CCP § 473(b). (New
Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403,
1419.) 
“Because the law strongly favors
trial and disposition on the merits, any doubts in applying section 2033.300
must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief. Accordingly, the court's
discretion to deny a motion under the statute is limited to circumstances where
it is clear that the mistake, inadvertence, or¿neglect was inexcusable, or
where it is clear that the withdrawal or amendment would not substantially
prejudice the party who obtained the admission in maintaining that party's
action or defense on the merits.” (New Albertsons, Inc., supra,
168 Cal.App.4th at 1420–21.)
 
            III.      DISCUSSION
Plaintiff seeks relief from
Requests for Admissions, Set One, deemed admitted by Court order on July 31,
2024, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.300. Plaintiff argues
that the deemed admissions resulted from inadvertence, mistake, or excusable
neglect attributable to prior counsel. Specifically, Plaintiff contends that
significant staff turnover led to confusion and disorganization, resulting in
the untimely service of responses. Additionally, when responses were eventually
served on July 24, 2024, they were submitted on an incorrect pleading template
from a dismissed case that listed the incorrect parties. Plaintiff contends
that substantive responses to the RFAs were provided before the hearing on
Defendants’ motion. Plaintiff contends that current counsel diligently sought
to address the matter upon assuming responsibility in the case in late August
2024. Plaintiff also contends that former counsel responsible for the mistake
has since left the firm in August 2024 (Motion, pp. 3-5, Reply, p.2)
Plaintiff further argues that
granting relief would not prejudice Defendants because the trial date is set
for April 28, 2026, providing ample time for discovery and preparation.
Conversely, denying relief would result in severe prejudice to Plaintiff, potentially
foreclosing the opportunity to litigate her claims on the merits. (Motion, p.6)
In opposition, Defendants argue
that Plaintiff has failed to establish excusable neglect. Defendants emphasize
that the motion is unsupported by a declaration from Plaintiff's prior counsel,
Erik Harper, who was responsible for the initial failure to respond and the
subsequent submission of defective responses. (Opposition, pp 2-3) Defendants
contends that the absence of testimony from Mr. Harper undermines Plaintiff’s
claim of excusable neglect. (Id.)
Defendants also argues that
Plaintiff’s failure to respond in a timely and proper manner resulted not from
neglect but from deliberate gamesmanship, citing email exchanges between prior
counsel. (Opposition, p.5) Moreover, Defendants claim that allowing relief at
this stage would substantially prejudice Defendants, as the deemed admissions
have streamlined the scope of discovery and defense strategy. (Opposition,
pp.7-8)
In response, Plaintiff argues that
excusable neglect has been adequately demonstrated through the declaration of
current counsel, who acted promptly to address the issue upon its discovery by
providing corrected responses and engaging in further meet-and-confer efforts
(Reply, p. 2). Specifically, Plaintiff’s counsel served code-compliant,
verified responses on November 1, 2024 (Reply, p. 4). Plaintiff further
contends that Defendants will not be prejudiced because they have ample time to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial, which is set for late April 2026
(Reply, pp. 4-5).
Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2033.300, the Court may permit the withdrawal or amendment of deemed
admissions if the admissions resulted from mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect, and if no substantial prejudice will result to the opposing party (New
Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1420). This
statute reflects California’s strong policy favoring resolution of cases on
their merits. Furthermore, any doubts should be resolved in favor of the moving
party to advance this policy (Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th
973, 979).
Here, the Court finds that
Plaintiff has demonstrated excusable neglect. The failure to timely respond was
the result of significant staff turnover and procedural errors by Plaintiff’s
prior counsel, who has since left the firm. While the absence of a declaration
from Mr. Harper, the prior counsel, is a notable omission, the detailed
explanation provided by Plaintiff’s current counsel and the procedural history
presented sufficiently establish that the errors were unintentional and not the
result of bad faith.
Moreover, the Court finds that
Defendants will not suffer substantial prejudice if relief is granted. The
trial date is more than a year away, providing ample time for any necessary
discovery adjustments. Given the policy under CCP section 2033.300 favoring
resolution of cases on their merits, the Court concludes that granting relief
is appropriate.
Based on the foregoing, the Court
GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER
             Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion granting relief from admissions deemed
admitted.
Plaintiff is to give notice.
