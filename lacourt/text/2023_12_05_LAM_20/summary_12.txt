And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions against the Defendant, Bruce Stallworth, due to his failure to appear for deposition or produce documents after the Court ordered him to do so. The Judge finds that the Defendant's actions amount to a misuse of the discovery process, which is punishable under California law. The Judge has stricken the Defendant's answer and entered a default against him, but has declined to award any monetary sanctions. The Judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and various court cases, including Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. and Rail Services of America v. State Comp. Ins. Fund. The Judge notes that the motion is granted because there is no opposition, and that counsel are encouraged to submit on the tentative or appear remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
