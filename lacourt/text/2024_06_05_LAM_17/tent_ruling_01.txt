TENTATIVE RULING
 



JACOB
  REICH
                           
         vs.
 
MANSOUR
  HASHEM
 


 Case No.: 
  19STCV20062
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date: June 5, 2024



 
Defendant’s
request for modification of the assignment order is GRANTED IN PART, DENIED IN
PART. The assignment of rents for the 14816 Avis Avenue Property is reduced to 20%,
and the 10826 Wagner Street Property is removed from the assignment order at
this time. Defendant’s motion is otherwise denied.  
 
On June 7, 2019, Plaintiff Jacob Reich filed
a Complaint against Defendant Mansour Hashem. On September 1, 2020, Plaintiff
filed a second amended complaint (SAC) 
alleging: (1) breach of written contract; (2) money had and received;
(3) common counts; (4) open book account; (5) account stated; (6) failure to
honor checks; (7) fraud; (8) negligence; (9) unjust enrichment; (10) judiciary
foreclosure; and (11) reformation of contract. 
 
            Now,
Defendant moves for a revocation or modification of the Court’s rent assignment
order. 
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendant
argues that the assignment order should be modified based on new facts and
circumstances since the order was originally entered. 
 
            After
review, the Court only agrees in part. 
 
            Defendant
argues that the order should be modified based on the following grounds: (1) 2
tenants have moved out of the 2007 Ocean Park property reducing rent from
$7,425 to $2,450; (2) the 40% garnishment for the 14816 Avis Avenue property
should be reduced to 20% because Defendant only owns ½ of the property; (3) it
is impossible for the rents at 10826 Wagner Street to be assigned because the
property is rented through Airbnb, and guests pay for their stay directly
through Airbnb; and (4) Defendant is entitled to be paid as a manager of the
properties. 
 
            As
for the first contention, Defendant supports his claim that rents have
decreased with three screenshots. The first is a text exchange that says “Now
everyone is moving out of the apartment end of November….” and a second that
seems to suggest the keys have been dropped off. However, the third screenshot
is an incomplete email that says “Accepted $954 from Mike pertaining to
security deposit for 2007 Ocean Park Santa Monica CA 90405.” No explanation is
provided as to who Mike it, and the accepting of a security deposit on
November 9 would suggest that a new tenant is moving in, not moving out. As
such, like with Defendant’s other motions, the evidence to support his claims
is incomplete and evasive. Defendant has not submitted adequate evidence to
support his claims that tenants have vacated the units and that his monthly
rents have been reduced. 
 
            As
for the second contention, the Court agrees. As a 50% owner of the Avis
Property, Defendant receives 50% of rents. 40% of Defendant’s 50% share would
amount to an assignment of 20% of the overall monthly rent payment. The order
should be adjusted accordingly. In opposition, Plaintiff conceded to this
request. 
 
            As
for the third contention, the Court agrees that the Airbnb system poses a
hurdle to the rent-assignment process. Clearly, guests cannot be expected to
assign a portion of their payment to Plaintiff, as they pay directly to Airbnb.
In opposition, Plaintiff did not identify any authority to suggest otherwise,
or which indicated how or whether the assignment order could be designed to
direct Airbnb itself to direct the payments it receives from guests in a manner
consistent with the assignment order. Accordingly, the Court finds that rents
from this property are not assignable at this time. 
 
            Finally,
as for the fourth contention, Defendant argues that he is entitled to payment
as a manager of the properties. However, Defendant offers no legal support for
this. (“This failure to cite pertinent legal authority is enough reason to
reject the argument”); Akins v. State of California (1998) 61
Cal.App.4th 1, 50, 71 (contention waived by failure to cite legal authority). 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, the Court grants Defendant’s request for modification of the
assignment order in part. The assignment of rents for the 14816 Avis Avenue
Property is reduced to 20%, and the 10826 Wagner Street Property is removed
from the assignment order at this time. Defendant’s motion is otherwise
denied.  
 
 
It is so ordered.
