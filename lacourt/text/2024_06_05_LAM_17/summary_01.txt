And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling denies Defendant's motion to disqualify the Judge. The Judge also grants Defendant's request to modify the assignment order in part. The assignment of rents for the 14816 Avis Avenue Property is reduced to 20%, and the 10826 Wagner Street Property is removed from the assignment order at this time. The Judge agrees to reduce the 40% garnishment for the 14816 Avis Avenue Property to 20% because Defendant only owns ½ of the property. The Judge also agrees to remove the 10826 Wagner Street Property from the assignment order because it is rented through Airbnb and guests pay directly to Airbnb.
