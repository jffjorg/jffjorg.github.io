Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Baldomero Murillo Esquivel, was working as an employee of Wilcox on a residential construction project when he was struck by wood thrown from the roof by a CCN employee. The defendant, KB Home, hired CCN as the framing and roofing subcontractor and Wilcox as a subcontractor.

The court has found that the Privette doctrine applies, which holds that a hirer generally delegates to an independent contractor all responsibility for workplace safety. The court has also found that KB Home did not have retained control over the work being performed by CCN, and therefore did not have a duty to ensure the safety of the plaintiff.

The court has also considered the plaintiff's argument that KB Home breached its duty under the statutory and regulatory framework, but has found that this argument is not supported by evidence. The court has concluded that the plaintiff has not raised a triable issue of fact and that the defendant is entitled to summary judgment.

The court has ordered that the parties submit to this tentative ruling by email to the court by the hearing date, and that if no party submits, the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
