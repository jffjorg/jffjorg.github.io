Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant's supplementation of its expert witness exchange. The defendant had initially designated a general orthopedic surgeon, but then supplemented with a foot and ankle specialist, Dr. Shanfield, after the plaintiff designated a foot and ankle specialist, Dr. Ouzounian. The judge found that the defendant's supplementation was permissible under Du-All Safety, LLC v. Superior Ct. (2019), which allows a party to supplement its expert witness exchange by adding experts to cover subjects on which the other party indicates it plans to offer expert testimony. The judge also found that the defendant acted in good faith and that the plaintiff was not shown to suffer substantial prejudice.
