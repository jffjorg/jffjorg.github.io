And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling continuing the hearing on November 13, 2024, to December 22, 2024, at 1:30 pm. The continuance is due to the defendant's capacity issues, specifically its suspension and anticipation of achieving good standing and corporate revival by mid-December 2024. The court has ordered the defendant to file a declaration regarding its revival status no more than 3 days prior to the continued date. The plaintiff has requested a trial continuance if the defendant's capacity issues are resolved, and the court has determined that there is sufficient time for the plaintiff to file a motion or stipulation to continue the trial once the defendant's capacity issue is resolved.
