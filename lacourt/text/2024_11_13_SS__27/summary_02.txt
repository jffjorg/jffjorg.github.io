Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment in this case. The case arises from a multi-vehicle accident that occurred on June 28, 2020, involving the plaintiff, Jenny Iturrios, and others. The defendant, Sabrina Hicks, was covered by an automobile liability insurance policy with GEICO, which provided bodily injury policy limits of $30,000 per person and $60,000 per incident.

Before filing the lawsuit, the plaintiffs and defendant entered into a settlement agreement, in which the defendant offered the bodily injury policy limit to the plaintiffs and they agreed to an apportionment of the policy limits. The agreement was reached through email exchanges between counsel for the parties and was confirmed on August 11, 2021.

The judge has found that the defendant has met its burden of demonstrating a valid settlement agreement, which serves as a complete defense to the plaintiff's claims. The plaintiff did not file an opposition to the motion, and therefore failed to raise a triable issue of fact. The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, which means that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the settlement agreement.
