  - The burden then shifts to the defendant to rebut the presumption by producing admissible evidence that the defendant's action was taken for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason
  - Pretext may be inferred from the timing of the discharge decision, the identity of the decision-maker, or by the discharged employee's job performance before termination
  - The Court liberally construes the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolves doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff's claims for discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and breach of contract failed because the plaintiff was not performing her job satisfactorily, there was no causal link between the plaintiff's complaints and her termination, and the defendant had legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for termination.

The judge found that there were triable issues of fact as to each of these claims. For example, the plaintiff presented evidence showing that she was performing her job satisfactorily, that the defendant was aware of the subordinate employees' behavior and did not take appropriate corrective action, and that the defendant's reasons for termination were pretextual.

The judge also found that the defendant's motion failed to meet its burden of showing that there was no triable issue of fact as to any material fact. The judge noted that the defendant presented evidence showing that the plaintiff had made complaints about discriminatory conduct to the defendant, but the defendant did not provide evidence showing that these complaints were unfounded.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further evidence and argument presented at the hearing. If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, they must email the courtroom by 8:00 a.m. on the day of the hearing.
