```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint and motion to strike. The demurrer to the ninth cause of action (violation of CLRA) is sustained because the CLRA only applies to goods or services, and the transaction involving the sale of real property is not covered. The demurrer to the remaining causes of action is overruled. The motion to strike punitive damages is granted because the plaintiff has failed to allege entitlement to punitive damages with the requisite specificity. The plaintiff is required to file and serve a first amended complaint within 30 days of notice of ruling, and the defendant is required to file and serve a response within 30 days thereafter.
