Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The judge's tentative ruling is in favor of the plaintiff, denying the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's request for punitive damages. The defendants, 727 Westbourne Vila B, LP and Moss Management Services, Inc., had moved to strike the plaintiff's request for punitive damages from the First Amended Complaint. The judge found that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support an award of punitive damages, including allegations of fraud, oppression, and malice by the defendants. The judge ordered the defendants to file an answer to the First Amended Complaint within 21 days and ordered the plaintiff to give notice. The judge also noted that the defendants' consistent failure to remedy serious defects at the property despite knowledge of their existence could support an award of punitive damages.
