The Judge's tentative ruling grants the petition to approve the minor's compromise presented by Plaintiff Cindy Lucrecia Gonzalez on behalf of claimant Arlene Gonzalez-Vargas. The petition is based on a settlement between Plaintiffs and Defendants Louis Sprague and Farmers Insurance Corporation. The gross settlement amount is $1 million, with $250,000 going to Arlene Gonzalez-Vargas, from which $62,500 will be deducted as attorney fees. The net amount of $187,500 will be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity, subject to withdrawal upon court order. The petition is supported by the declaration of Cindy Lucrecia Gonzalez and Plaintiffs' counsel Eric Castelblanco, who describes the work performed in this case, the apportionment of the settlement, and the basis for the attorney fees sought. The Judge finds that the apportionment of the settlement and the fees claimed therefrom are reasonable, and therefore grants the petition.
