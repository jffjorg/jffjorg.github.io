Ricardo Lumbreras’s Motions to Compel Responses to Interrogatories and Requests
for Production, and to Deem Matters Admitted against Defendant Felipe Carlos
Segoiva are GRANTED. Sanctions are awarded against Defendant in the amount of $945.
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
 
I.               
MOTION TO
COMPEL & DEEM ADMITTED
A propounding party may demand a responding
party to produce documents that are in their possession, custody or control.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010.) A party may likewise conduct discovery by
propounding interrogatories to another party to be answered under oath. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.010, subd. (a).) The responding party must respond to the
production demand either by complying, by representing that the party lacks the
ability to comply, or by objecting to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.210.) The responding party must respond to the interrogatories by
answering or objecting. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.210, subd. (a).) If the
responding party fails to serve timely responses, the propounding party may
move for an order compelling responses to the production demand and
interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) 
 
A
party who fails to serve a timely response to interrogatories or a demand for
inspection waives any objection to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
2031.300.)
Likewise,
“[a]ny party may obtain discovery . . . by a written request that any other
party to the action admit the genuineness of specified documents, or the truth
of specified matters of fact, opinion relating to fact, or application of law
to fact. A request for admission may relate to a matter that is in controversy
between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.010.) If a party fails to serve a timely response to requests for
admissions, “[t]he requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness
of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be
deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280 subd. (b).)
A
party who fails to timely respond to requests for admission waives all
objections to the requests. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (a).)
Plaintiff
Ricardo Lumbreras (Plaintiff) served Defendant Felipe Carlos Segovia with
interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission on April
13, 2023, with a due date of May 19, 2023. (Sullivan Decl. ¶¶ 2–3.) Defendant
has yet to provide responses, despite written reminders from Plaintiff’s
counsel. (Sullivan Decl. ¶¶ 6–7.) Defendant has filed no opposition to the
present motion.
The
motions to compel and deem admitted are therefore GRANTED.
II.            
SANCTIONS.

The
prevailing party on a motion to compel is generally entitled to monetary
sanctions, unless the court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) Sanctions are
also mandatory against a party whose failure to serve responses to requests for
admission makes the motion necessary. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
Plaintiff
seeks a total of $945 in sanctions, representing $240 in attorney fees (1.2
hours at $200 per hour) per motion, plus three $75 e-filing fees. (Sullivan
Decl. ¶¶ 8–12.) 
 
Sanctions
are awarded against Defendant in the amount of $945.
