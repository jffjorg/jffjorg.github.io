And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London Subscribing to the Policy, on their motion for a determination of good faith settlement. The settlement amount is $5,000,000, which is proportionate to the policy limit of $10,000,000. The judge has found that the settlement is not grossly disproportionate to what a reasonable person at the time of settlement would estimate the settlor's liability to be. The judge has also denied the defendant's motion to seal the settlement amount, as it was previously publicly filed in a notice of motion for good faith settlement.

The court has granted the defendant's motion for a determination of good faith settlement, which means that the settlement is binding and will bar any claims from co-defendants. The court has also denied the defendant's motion to seal the settlement agreement itself, as it was previously publicly available.

The next steps in the case are to consider motions for summary judgment and/or summary adjudication, and to proceed to trial on November 4, 2024.
