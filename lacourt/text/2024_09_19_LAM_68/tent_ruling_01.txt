SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
February 26, 2018, Plaintiff Melrose Quality Pain Relief, Inc. and Defendant
1041 Wall Street, Inc. entered into a contract identified as the “Option to
Purchase License Agreement.” The agreement provided 1041 Wall Street the right
to purchase a certain interest in a marijuana business owned by Melrose Quality
Pain Relief, Inc. The agreement includes a certain payment schedule for the 12
month option period. 
 
Plaintiff
maintains that Defendant Robert Cazarin paid the $100,000 initial deposit, but
defaulted on either three or five of the $45,000 monthly installments. 
 
On
February 23, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Breach of Contract, Fraud,
Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Interference with Prospective Economic Advantage, and
Violation of California Unfair Competition Law, Cal. Bus. & Prof Code§
17200, et seq. On April 4, 2022Robert Cazarin and 1401 Wall Street answered,
and filed a cross-complaint against Abdul Ahmed and Melrose Quality Pain
Relief, Inc. for Fraud, Breach of Contract, and Recission. The cross-complaint
alleges Cross-Defendants misrepresented their licensing status for legal
participation in the marijuana industry. 
 
Cross-Defendants
answered the cross-complaint on October 26, 2022. On May 8, 2023, Plaintiff
dismissed Donta Foreman and Robert Cazarin without prejudice. 
 
RULING: Denied.
Counsel for Plaintiff Melrose Quality Pain Relief, Inc. and
cross-defendant Abdul Ala Ahmed moves to be relieved as counsel of record due
to a “threat” to counsel and family. [See Declaration In Support.] Counsel
filed two separate motions for the same date, which the court addresses in a
joint order.
 
The motions lack any proof of service. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1005, subd. (b); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court cannot grant
any and all motions without proof of service. The motions are denied without
prejudice.
 
Trial scheduled for October 21, 2024.
 
Moving
counsel to provide notice to all parties.
