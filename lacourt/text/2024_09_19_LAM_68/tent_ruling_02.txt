SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff Gavrielli Brands, LLC imported certain footwear
for sale in the United stated under the “Tieks” brand. Third party Catrone
Freight Logistics coordinated the importation of the shipment(s) from the Port
of Long Beach and storage of the merchandise from the with defendant Empire
Container Freight Station, Inc. While Plaintiff utilized the services of
Defendant, beginning in 2017, Plaintiff began to discover missing merchandise appearing
for sale on eBay. When Plaintiff confronted Defendant, a counter demand for
$732,915.50 in storage charges was presented, and denial of access to the
property without payment. Plaintiff contends Defendant “stole” at least 21,528
pairs of shoes from the shipments at a retail value of $4.3 million. 
 
On March 7, 2022, plaintiff filed its complaint for Possession
of Personal Property, Conversion, Negligence, Promissory Fraud, and Unfair
Competition. A 170.6 challenge led to reassignment from Department 51 to 68. On
June 14, 2022, Defendant answered and filed a cross-complaint for Breach of
Contract, Open Account, and Unfair Business Practices. On December 7, 2022, a
first amended cross-complaint was filed. The court sustained the demurrer to
the first amended cross-complaint with 20 days leave to amend on February 6,
2023. The second amended cross-complaint was filed on March 2, 2023. On May 16,
2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the second amended cross-complaint
without leave to amend. 
 
On January 30, 2024, Empire Container Freight Station, Inc.
filed a 170.6 peremptory challenge to the court. The challenge was accepted and
the case reassigned. On February 23, 2024, the court (Department 1) entered a
subsequent stipulation rescinding the second filed 170.6 peremptory challenge
brought by Empire Container Freight Station, Inc., and restoring previously
vacated hearings and the trial.
 
On April 23, 2024, the court granted Plaintiff leave to file
a first amended complaint. On April 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed a first amended
complaint for Possession of Personal Property, Conversion, Negligence,
Promissory Fraud, and Unfair Competition.
 
RULING: Denied/Moot.
Plaintiff
Gavrielli Brands, LLC moves to deem Request for Admissions (set one), served on
Defendant Empire Container Freight Station, Inc. The court electronic filing
system shows no opposition at the time of the tentative ruling publication
cutoff. Plaintiff filed a supplemental declaration acknowledging service of
“incomplete responses” to the outstanding discovery. [Supplemental Declaration
of Gilbert Mikalian, Ex. 9.]
 
Given
the acknowledgment of responses by moving party, the court denies the motion
and deems the motion moot. “As one
court put it: ‘If the party manages to serve its responses before the hearing,
the court has no discretion but to deny the motion. But woe betide the party
who fails to serve responses before the hearing.’” (St. Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 762, 776.) The court otherwise declines to rule on the validity of
the responses as to numbers 53, 54 and 60. (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 408–409.) 
 
Multiple motions to compel discovery on calendar for October
23, and November 5, 2024. 
 
Plaintiff
to give notice.
