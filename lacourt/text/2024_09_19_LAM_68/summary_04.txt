And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by Solaray, LLC (the "Defendant") to deem requests for admissions admitted. The Defendant argued that the Plaintiff's responses to the requests for admissions were unverified and therefore invalid. The Plaintiff, Bewind Company Limited, argued that the responses were verified and that the Defendant's motion was untimely, lacked a separate statement, and failed to meet and confer.

The court has concluded that the Plaintiff's responses were verified prior to the hearing, and therefore the motion is MOOT and DENIED. The court also found that the Defendant's motion was improperly reserved and noticed, and that the Defendant failed to meet and confer with the Plaintiff before filing the motion.

The court has also denied the Defendant's request for sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.290, subdivision (d). The court declines to consider the motion to compel further responses, as it was improperly noticed, unreserved, and unsupported.

The court's ruling is based on the following findings: (1) the Plaintiff's responses were verified prior to the hearing, (2) the Defendant's motion was improperly reserved and noticed, (3) the Defendant failed to meet and confer with the Plaintiff before filing the motion, and (4) the motion lacks sufficient support.
