GOOD FAITH SETTLEMENT
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant, Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s
of London Subscribing to the Policy
RESPONDING PARTY: Unopposed/Plaintiff, Matthew Garza, et
al.
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Motion for Determination of Good Faith Settlement 
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
Plaintiff Matthew S. Garza was a Major League Baseball
(MLB) pitcher for 12 years. Plaintiff’s career 
with a MLB team ended after the the 2017 season, due to a pitching arm
shoulder injury, which was not successfully repaired following surgery well
enough to return to MLB pitching form. 
 
Prior to the injury causing event, Plaintiff procured a
ten million disability insurance policy from defendant Certain Underwriters at
Lloyd’s of London Subscribing to the Policy (Lloyd’s). Plaintiff maintains the
policy was procured and submitted by defendant International Specialty
Insurance Services, Inc. (ISI), Nigro Karlin Segal & Feldstein, LLP and
NKSFB, LLC (collectively NKSFB). Defendants Paradigm - Gilbert Insurance Group,
LLC, and Gilbert Insurance Services, Inc. (Paradigm and Gilbert) assisted Plaintiff
in providing information in support of the application, though the application
admittedly omitted certain information at the time of submission. Following
submission of the claim to Lloyd’s, the claim was denied based at least in part
on the provision of an incomplete application. 
 
On Jul 1, 2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Breach of
Contract, Breach of Implied Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, and Breach of
Duties as an Insurance Broker. The case was initially filed in Fresno County,
and transferred to Los Angeles County on April 5, 2022, following a successful
motion to change venue. Lloyd’s also previously filed a cross-complaint against
Paradigm and Gilbert for Fraud, Negligence, Negligent Misrepresentation, and
Comparative Fault/Contribution. 
 
On May 11, 2022, the case was reassigned from complex
court to Department 68, and independent calendar court. On July 26, 2022, the
court granted the motion to strike the cross-complaint with leave to amend.
Lloyd’s filed its first amended cross-complaint on August 11, 2022. On December
6, 2022, the court denied the motion to strike the first amended
cross-complaint. 
 
On December 21, 2022, the court granted Plaintiff leave
to file a first amended complaint. The amended pleading added in defendants
NKSFB and new causes of action. On the same date, the first amended complaint
for Breach of Contract (first and fourth causes of action), Breach of Implied
Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, Breach of Duties as an Insurance
Brokers, Intentional Misrepresentation, Negligent Misrepresentation, and Breach
of Fiduciary Duties, was filed. 
 
On March 23, 2023, the court denied the motion to compel
arbitration. On March 29, 2203, the court overruled the demurrer to the first
amended complaint, and a motion for sanctions, both brought by Gilbert
Insurance Services. 
 
On December 14, 2023, the court granted the motion of
International Specialty Insurance Services, Inc. to interplead $133,624.68 in
funds with the court.
 
RULING: Granted.
Defendant Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s of London
Subscribing to the Policy (Lloyd’s) moves for a determination of good faith
settlement with Plaintiff Matthew Garza, thereby barring any claims from
Co-Defendants International Specialty Insurance Services, Inc. (ISI), Nigro
Karlin Segal & Feldstein, LLP and NKSFB, LLC (collectively NKSFB), Paradigm
- Gilbert Insurance Group, LLC, and Gilbert Insurance Services, Inc. (Paradigm
and Gilbert). The court electronic filing system shows no opposition or reply
on file at the time of the tentative ruling publication cutoff.
 
Lloyd’s settled all claims for $5,000,000. [See Motion to
Seal Settlement Amount.] The agreement required a dismissal with prejudice in
favor of Lloyd’s, and a waiver of any claims for the recovery of attorney fees
against the insurer by Plaintiff (“Brandt” attorney fees).
 
“[T]he
intent and policies underlying section 877.6 require that a number of factors
be taken into account including a rough approximation of plaintiffs' total
recovery and the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in
settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs, and a
recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than he would if he
were found liable after a trial. Other relevant considerations include the
financial conditions and insurance policy limits of settling defendants, as
well as the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure
the interests of nonsettling defendants.” (Tech-Bilt,
Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, 499.)
 
Making a good faith settlement determination necessarily
requires the trial court to examine and weigh all of the Tech-Bilt factors, one
of the most important of which is the settling party's proportionate liability.
(Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc. v.
Superior Court (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 864, 871.) Indeed, the ultimate
determinant of good faith is whether the settlement is grossly disproportionate
to what a reasonable person at the time of settlement would estimate the
settlor's liability to be. (City of Grand
Terrace v. Superior Court (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1251, 1262.)  
 
In determining the good faith of a settlement, the court
may rely upon declarations, or in its discretion, other evidence at the
hearing.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
877.6(b).)  The court may also “‘rely on
its own expertise and the opinions of experts in reaching a determination of
good or bad faith of a settlement.’” (Regan
Roofing Co. v. Superior Court (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1685, 1702.)  The burden on a motion for determination of
good faith settlement rests squarely on the party opposing the finding of good
faith.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 877.6.) 
 
Lloyd’s contends the $5,000,000 settlement is well within
the ballpark for liability. The policy limit was $10,000,000. The application
lacked material information, and Plaintiff denied ever receiving or completing
a supplemental application form ultimately submitted. Lloyd’s further
represents never receiving complete medical records allowing for evaluation of
the claim. [Declaration of Aaron Sussman-Bhandari.]
 
While Lloyd’s challenged the right to recover on the
incomplete policy, and denies any post-claim denial, Lloyd’s apparently
concedes to the potential for liability on the claim brought in the subject
action. “‘An insurer has an obligation to its insureds to do its underwriting
at the time a policy application is made, not after a claim is filed. It is
patently unfair for a claimant to obtain a policy, pay his premiums and operate
under the assumption that he is insured against a specified risk, only to learn
after he submits a claim that he is not insured, and, therefore,
cannot obtain any other policy to cover the loss. The insurer controls when the
underwriting occurs.... If the insured is not an acceptable risk, the
application should [be] denied up front, not after a policy is issued. This allows
the proposed insured to seek other coverage with another company since no
company will insure an individual who has suffered serious illness or injury.’
(Citation.)” (Hailey v. California Physicians' Service (2007) 158
Cal.App.4th 452, 465.) In issuing the policy, courts find an obligation on both
the applicant and insurer to submit a complete application, in order to allow
the insurer “to accurately assess the risk before issuing the contract, if the
plan wishes to preserve the right to later rescind.” (Id. at p. 472.)
Inherent in the effort to rescind the agreement raises questions on the
wrongful withholding of insurance benefits due under the insurance contract. (Egan
v. Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co. (1979) 24 Cal.3d 809, 818.)
 
Given the maximum policy limit of $10,000,000, Lloyd’s
maintains the settlement represents “a more than proportionate” amount given
the disputed liability. The court finds no basis undermining the showing of the
good faith settlement in the unopposed motion. The settlement is proportionate
to the limits of policy given a potentially disputed claim over responsibility
for the alleged submission of the incomplete application, especially with the
purported role of co-defendants in submitting the information to Lloyd’s. The
court finds no basis of any collusion, fraud or tortious conduct directed
towards the non-settling defendants given the claims against co-defendants.
 
The motion is GRANTED.

SUMMARY OF ACTION
Plaintiff Matthew S. Garza was a Major League Baseball
(MLB) pitcher for 12 years. Plaintiff’s career 
with a MLB team ended after the the 2017 season, due to a pitching arm
shoulder injury, which was not successfully repaired following surgery well
enough to return to MLB pitching form. 
 
Prior to the injury causing event, Plaintiff procured a
ten million disability insurance policy from defendant Certain Underwriters at
Lloyd’s of London Subscribing to the Policy (Lloyd’s). Plaintiff maintains the
policy was procured and submitted by defendant International Specialty
Insurance Services, Inc. (ISI), Nigro Karlin Segal & Feldstein, LLP and
NKSFB, LLC (collectively NKSFB). Defendants Paradigm - Gilbert Insurance Group,
LLC, and Gilbert Insurance Services, Inc. (Paradigm and Gilbert) assisted Plaintiff
in providing information in support of the application, though the application
admittedly omitted certain information at the time of submission. Following
submission of the claim to Lloyd’s, the claim was denied based at least in part
on the provision of an incomplete application. 
 
On Jul 1, 2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Breach of
Contract, Breach of Implied Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, and Breach of
Duties as an Insurance Broker. The case was initially filed in Fresno County,
and transferred to Los Angeles County on April 5, 2022, following a successful
motion to change venue. Lloyd’s also previously filed a cross-complaint against
Paradigm and Gilbert for Fraud, Negligence, Negligent Misrepresentation, and
Comparative Fault/Contribution. 
 
On May 11, 2022, the case was reassigned from complex
court to Department 68, and independent calendar court. On July 26, 2022, the
court granted the motion to strike the cross-complaint with leave to amend.
Lloyd’s filed its first amended cross-complaint on August 11, 2022. On December
6, 2022, the court denied the motion to strike the first amended
cross-complaint. 
 
On December 21, 2022, the court granted Plaintiff leave
to file a first amended complaint. The amended pleading added in defendants
NKSFB and new causes of action. On the same date, the first amended complaint
for Breach of Contract (first and fourth causes of action), Breach of Implied
Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, Breach of Duties as an Insurance
Brokers, Intentional Misrepresentation, Negligent Misrepresentation, and Breach
of Fiduciary Duties, was filed. 
 
On March 23, 2023, the court denied the motion to compel
arbitration. On March 29, 2203, the court overruled the demurrer to the first
amended complaint, and a motion for sanctions, both brought by Gilbert
Insurance Services. 
 
On December 14, 2023, the court granted the motion of
International Specialty Insurance Services, Inc. to interplead $133,624.68 in
funds with the court.
 
RULING: Denied.
Defendant Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s of London
Subscribing to the Policy (Lloyd’s) submits an application to seal references
to any and all settlement amounts referenced in the unredacted/submitted under
seal version of the motion for determination of good faith settlement. The
court electronic filing system shows no opposition or reply on file at the time
of the tentative ruling publication cutoff.
 
A party
requesting that a record be filed under seal must file a motion or an
application for an order sealing the record. The motion or application must be
accompanied by a memorandum and a declaration containing facts sufficient to
justify the sealing. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(1).) Unless
confidentiality is required by law, court records are presumed to be open. (Id.
at 2.550(c).) To grant an order sealing records, the court must expressly find
that Defendant has presented facts that establish: (1) There exists an
overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record;
(2) The overriding interest supports sealing the record; (3) A substantial
probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the
record is not sealed; (4) The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and (5) No
less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest. Id. at
2.550(d). To establish that an overriding interest is sufficient, plaintiff
must clearly identify the interest and demonstrate “a substantial probability
that it will be prejudiced absent sealing or closure.” (Universal City
Studios, Inc. v. Superior Court (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1273, 1283.) 
 
Financial terms are entitled to protection from disclosure. (Hinshaw, Winkler, Draa, Marsh & Still (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 233, 241 disapproved on
unrelated grounds in Williams v. Superior
Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 557 (footnote 8).) Settlement
agreements with a binding confidentiality agreement can constitute an
overriding interest, supporting the basis for sealing of the document. The
court assumes the settlement agreement submitted under seal contains a
confidentiality provision, as is standard practice. 
 
“(4) Lodging of record pending determination of
motion or application
The party requesting that a record be filed under seal must
lodge it with the court under (d) when the motion or application is made,
unless good cause exists for not lodging it or the record has previously been
lodged under (3)(A)(i). Pending the determination of the motion or application,
the lodged record will be conditionally under seal.
 
“(5)  Redacted and unredacted versions
If necessary to prevent disclosure, any motion or
application, any opposition, and any supporting documents must be filed in a
public redacted version and lodged in a complete, unredacted version
conditionally under seal. The cover of the redacted version must identify it as
"Public-Redacts materials from conditionally sealed record." The
cover of the unredacted version must identify it as ‘May Not Be Examined
Without Court Order-Contains material from conditionally sealed record.’”
 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b).)
 
The motion to seal only seeks to seal the settlement amount
itself. The May 31, 2024, filed and now scanned into the electronic records
system notice of motion for good faith settlement however identifies the
settlement amount. [See Notice of Motion for Determination of Good Faith
Settlement Agreement, 2:19, 23-24.] Because Lloyd’s filed the notice identifying
the amount in a publicly filed pleading, rather than submitting both the
settlement agreement and redacted notice motion for good faith settlement, the
court finds no basis for sealing the amount. (Note the separately filed
Memorandum of Points and Authorities in fact redacts the settlement amount.) While
the unopposed motion otherwise supports a finding for sealing the settlement
agreement itself, typographical/clerical error aside, the court finds no basis
of authority to redact terms in a previously filed, now publicly available
document.
 
The court therefore DENIES the motion to seal the settlement
amount.
 
The court can consider any request to seal the settlement
agreement itself submitted with the court, or Lloyd’s may withdraw all
documents, and retrieve the lodged documents from the court. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 2.551(b)(6).) The court will concurrently rule on the motion for
good faith settlement, which Lloyd’s may also consider in its decision on how
to proceed.
