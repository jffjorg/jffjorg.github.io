And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to deem requests for admissions admitted (set one) filed by the plaintiff, Gavrielli Brands, LLC. The motion was unopposed, meaning that the defendant, Empire Container Freight Station, Inc., did not file any opposition to the motion. The plaintiff had acknowledged serving the defendant with incomplete responses to outstanding discovery.

The judge has denied the motion and deemed it moot because the plaintiff has managed to serve its responses before the hearing, as required by California law. The judge has also declined to rule on the validity of the responses to certain requests for admissions.

The case is scheduled for multiple motions to compel discovery on October 23 and November 5, 2024. The plaintiff is required to give notice of the tentative ruling.
