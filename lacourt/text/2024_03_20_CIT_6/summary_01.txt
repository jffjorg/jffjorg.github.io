Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied the Plaintiff's motion to deem requests admitted and for sanctions. The Plaintiff requested an order deeming the Plaintiff's First Set of Requests for Admission to the Defendant admitted, and for an order compelling responses to the Plaintiff's First Sets of Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production, as well as monetary sanctions against the Defendant in the amount of $3,737.50.

The Court found that the Plaintiff's motions were not well-taken. The Defendant was served with the Summons and Complaint on November 13, 2023, and had 30 days to file and serve a responsive pleading. However, the Defendant did not file or serve any responsive pleading, and the Plaintiff did not request entry of default. Instead, the Plaintiff waited until February 2, 2024, to file the discovery motions and seek monetary sanctions.

The Court also found that the Plaintiff combined all discovery requests into one document and paid only one motion filing fee, which was improper. The Court denied the Plaintiff's requests for monetary sanctions, finding that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust and the Defendant's failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission did not necessitate the motion.

The Court ordered the Plaintiff to give notice of the Court's ruling within five calendar days of this order.
