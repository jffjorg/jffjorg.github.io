The judge discloses that approximately 24 years ago, she and her husband purchased a pickup truck that developed electrical problems. The manufacturer and dealer agreed to refund the purchase price without litigation. The judge does not believe that her personal experience will bias her decision, but if a party believes otherwise, they have until May 23, 2024, to file and serve a verified statement of disqualification. The plaintiff is ordered to notify any new parties added to the case and file proof of service. Any new party has 14 calendar days from the date of service to file and serve the statement.
