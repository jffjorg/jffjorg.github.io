  [TENTATIVEorder: motion
  to seal 



 
I.
BACKGROUND 
 
On
August 25, 2019, plaintiff Pejman Kohansedgh (“Plaintiff”), the landlord of a
certain residential real property entered a lease and a guaranty to the lease
with defendants Gonzalo Lizama, Yasmina Monjaraz, Santiago Monjaraz, and
Yesenia Cayetano (collectively “Defendants”). In June 2023, Defendants ceased
rent payments but remained in possession of the Property. ¿ 
¿ 
On
December 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed an unlawful detainer complaint (the
“Complaint”) against Defendants. ¿On February 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
amended complaint (the “FAC”).
 
On
May 29, 2024, the Court denied the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by defendants
Yesenia Cayetano and Santiago Monjaraz. 
 
On August 7, 2024, the Court
entered Judgment against Defendants for possession and money for past due rent
and holdover damages in the sum of $45,150.00.
 
On August 14, 2024, defendants Gonzalo Lizama and Yasmina
Monjaraz filed their Motion to 
Seal, which Plaintiff opposed on September 5, 2024. There is no reply as
of September 13, 2024. 
 
II. LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
A party that requests that a record or portion of a record be filed
under seal must file a motion or an application for an order sealing it. The
motion must be accompanied by a supporting memorandum and a declaration
containing facts sufficient to justify the sealing.¿(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.551(b)(1); Savaglio v Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th
588, 597–601.) All parties that have appeared in the case must be served with a
copy of the motion or application. Unless the judge orders otherwise, a party
that already possesses copies of the records to be sealed must be served with a
complete, unredacted version of all papers as well as a redacted version. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 2.551(b)(2).)¿ 
¿¿ 
Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 2.550(d), a judge may order
that a record be filed under seal only if the judge expressly finds facts that
establish all the following:¿¿¿ 
(1)  
There exists an overriding
interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record; 
(2)  
The overriding interest
supports sealing the record; 
(3)  
A substantial probability
exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not
sealed; 
(4)  
The proposed sealing is
narrowly tailored; and 
(5)  
No less restrictive means
exist to achieve the overriding interest.¿ 
In ruling on a motion to seal, the court must weigh the competing
interests and concerns.¿This process necessitates (1) identifying the specific
information claimed to be entitled to protection from public disclosure, (2)
identifying the nature of the harm threatened by disclosure, and (3)
identifying and accounting for countervailing considerations. (H.B. Fuller
Co. v. Doe (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 879, 894.) Therefore, in order to prevail
on his motion, the moving party must present a specific enumeration of the
facts sought to be withheld and the specific reasons for withholding them. (Id.
at 904.)¿ 
¿ 
The California Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment provides
“a right of access to ordinary civil trial and proceedings.” (NBC Subsidiary
(KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1212.) The court
further noted its belief that “the public has an interest, in all civil cases,
in observing and assessing the performance of its public judicial system.” (Id.
at 1210.) There is a presumption of openness in civil court proceedings.
(Id. at 1217.) This presumption may apply to seemingly private
proceedings. (In re Marriage of Burkle (2006) 135 Cal. App.4th 1045,
1052 [divorce proceedings].)  
¿ 
Before ordering filed documents sealed, courts must find compelling
reasons, prejudice absent sealing and the lack of less-restrictive means. (NBC
Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc., supra, 20 Cal.4th at 1208–1209 n.
25; Hurvitz v. Hoefflin (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 1232, 1246; Champion
v.¿Sup.¿Ct. (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 777, 787.) A proposed sealing must be
narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest, such as by sealing portions
of pleadings or redacting particular text. (Burkle, supra, 135
Cal.App.4th at 1052, 1070.) An application to seal must be accompanied by a
declaration containing facts sufficient to justify sealing. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 2.551(b)(1).)¿¿ 
 
CCP section 1161.2
permits certain people from accessing Limited Civil case records. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1161.2(a)(1) [“The clerk shall allow access to limited civil case
records filed under this chapter . . . .”].) Section 1161.2(a)
provides in relevant part that records in an unlawful detainer matter will not
be sealed if judgment is entered for the plaintiff within sixty days of the
date on which the complaint is filed:  
 
(1) The clerk shall allow access to limited civil
case records filed under this chapter, including the court file, index, and
register of actions, only as follows: 
 
(F) Except as provided in subparagraph (G)1,
to any other person 60 days after the complaint has been filed if judgment
against all defendants has been entered for the plaintiff within 60 days of the
filing of the complaint, in which case the clerk shall allow access to any
court records in the action. If a default or default judgment is set aside more
than 60 days after the complaint has been filed, this section shall apply as if
the complaint had been filed on the date the default or default judgment is set
aside. 
 
Here, moving
defendants seek to have the entire record sealed pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 2.550, contending that the severe consequences of having
this eviction action on their record must outweigh the right of public access
to these records. Alternatively, moving defendants request the record be
confidential from the public until further order from the Court pursuant to CCP
section 1161.2. 
 
Upon review of the
motion and declarations in support of the motion, the Court finds the
following. There exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of
public access to the record and the overriding interest supports sealing the
record as prospective landlords for affordable and habitable units have told
moving defendants that an unsealed eviction judgment on their record would make
them ineligible. (Motion, p. 2; Lizama Decl., ¶ 4; Monjaraz Decl., ¶ 4.) A
substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced
if the record is not sealed. (Motion, p. 2; Lizama Decl. ¶ 6; Monjaraz Decl., ¶
6.) The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored and no less restrictive means
exist to preserve the overriding interest as moving defendants only ask that
the matter be sealed so that they can find suitable housing. (Motion, p. 2.) Further,
moving defendants contend there is no prejudice to Plaintiff in granting the
motion. (Motion, p. 3.) Nor does Plaintiff raise prejudice in opposition;
instead, Plaintiff merely discusses Defendants’ bad faith arguments in this
action.  
 
Accordingly,
the Court grants the motion pursuant to
California Rules of Court, rule 2.550. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
