[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS
 
Dept. 107
9:00 a.m.
September 18,
  2024



 
I.               
BACKGROUND
On December
29, 2023, Plaintiff Julianne Theresa Ross filed a complaint against Defendants
City of Los Angeles, and 8155 Langdon Avenue, LLC, among others, alleging a
cause of action for premises liability/dangerous condition of public property
arising out of Plaintiff’s alleged trip and fall over an uneven portion of
sidewalk.
On April
15, 2024, Plaintiff filed proof of service by substituted service as to
Defendant 8155 Langdon Avenue, LLC (“Defendant”).
On May 16, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to quash
service of summons and complaint. On July 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition. On July 15, 2024, Defendant filed a reply.
 
II.            
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 418.10
reads in relevant part:
“(a) A defendant, on or before the
last day of his or her time to plead or within any further time that the court
may for good cause allow, may serve and file a notice of motion for one or more
of the following purposes:
(1) To quash service of summons on
the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”
““When a defendant challenges the
court's personal jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process the
burden is on the plaintiff to prove … the facts requisite to an effective
service.” (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 CA4th 403, 413, (internal
quotes omitted); see Lebel v. Mai (2012) 210 CA4th 1154, 1163).” Weil
& Brown, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2019) ¶
4:421.5. “‘[C]ompliance with the statutory procedures for service of process is
essential to establish personal jurisdiction.’” (Ellard v. Conway (2001)
94 Cal.App.4th 540, 544; accord Renoir v. Redstar Corp. (2004) 123
Cal.App.4th 1145, 1152.) A filed proof of service creates a rebuttable
presumption that service was proper, if it complies with applicable statutory
requirements. (Floveyor Internat. v. Sup. Ct. (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 789,
795.)
 
III.          
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant moves to quash service of summons and
complaint. 
 
According to the proof of service filed on April 15,
2024, service was made on Defendant’s appointed agent Ritesh Desai by
substituted service on John Doe, a receptionist at Defendant’s headquarters.
(Scott Decl., ¶ 2; Exh.
A.) There is also a declaration of mailing attached, showing that the summons
and complaint were mailed at the same address where Doe was served. (Id.)
 
Defendant argues that the summons and complaint were not
placed in the hand of the alleged John Doe, but was left on the front doorstep
of the building, outside the front door and the appointed agent did not receive
a copy. (Salas Decl., ¶
2; and Desai
Decl., ¶ 5.) Additionally, Defendant
argues there is no declaration of due diligence on file, attesting to whether
the process server attempted personal service before serving by substituted
service.
 
In opposition, Plaintiff provides a photograph which
disproves Salas’ averment that the summons and complaint were left on the front
doorstep of the building. The process server took a photograph of Salas, which
depicts that the summons and complaint were left on his desk right in front of
him. (Kocaj Decl., Exh. B: Sallee Decl. of Diligence.) A trial court is
not required to accept “self-serving evidence contradicting [a] process
server’s declaration.”  (American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011)
199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390.) In light of the photograph, the court does not
accept the self-serving declarations of Salas, attesting that that the summons
and complaint were left outside, and Desai, attesting that he did not receive
by mail the summons and complaint. Even if the court were to accept Desai’s
declaration that he did not receive the summons and complaint by mail, “service
of a summons is deemed completed on the 10th day after mailing.”
(CCP § 415.20(a).) Actual receipt is not a requirement. 
 
The court next addresses whether reasonable diligence is
required in serving a limited liability company, such as Defendant with
substituted service. 
 
The
persons on whom service may be rendered on behalf of a limited liability
company is governed by Corp. Code §17701.16.  Section 17701.16(b)
provides, service on a limited liability company may be done by “[p]ersonal
service…(1) to any individual designated by it as agent, or (2) if the designated
agent is a corporation, to any person named in the latest certificate of the
corporate agent filed pursuant to Section 1505 at the office of the corporate
agent[.]” In addition to this method of service, an LLC may be served by
substituted service on the designated agent pursuant to CCP §415.20(a). 
(Corp. Code §17701.16(a).)   
 
CCP §
415.20(a) provides that, in lieu of personal service “to the person to be
served as specified in [CCP] Section 416.10 [the registered agent],” service
may be effected “by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint during usual
office hours in his or her office . . . with the person who is apparently in
charge thereof, and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and complaint
by first-class mail, postage prepaid to the person to be served at the place
where a copy of the summons and complaint were left.” Service on a limited
liability company may be made in the same manner. (See Corp. Code §§
17701.13(a)(2) [limited liability company required to maintain agent for
service of process], 17701.16(b)–(c) [manner of service on limited liability
company]; Weil et al., Cal. Prac. Guide, Civil Procedure Before Trial, Ch. 4-D,
¶ 4:172 [“The designated agent may be served either by personal service (CCP §
415.10, ¶ 4:184 ff.); substitute service (CCP § 415.20(a), ¶ 4:193 ff.); or
service by mail with acknowledgment of receipt (CCP § 415.30(a), ¶ 4:225
ff.).”].)  
Here, the proof of service complies with the statutory
requirements as service was effected Defendant’s agent, Ritesh Desai, by
substituted service on John Doe. As such, the proof of service creates a
presumption that service was proper. 
As noted above, Defendant argues that there is no showing
that two or three attempts were made at personal service on Desai, prior to
resorting to substituted service on John Doe, and thus, Defendant argues that
Plaintiff has not shown reasonable diligence. 
In
opposition, Plaintiff argues that reasonable diligence is not required for
serving business entities, and it is only required for serving individuals. The
court agrees.  Here, substituted service is made pursuant to CCP § 415.20(a), and not CCP § 415.20(b). While the plain
terms of CCP § 415.20(b) does require reasonable diligence, CCP § 415.20(a)
does not. Further, Defendant cites to federal district court decisions that California
has no “reasonable diligence” requirement for substitute service on entities. (Gunnar Optiks, LLC,
23-cv-0671-AGS-VET (S.D. Cal. Jan. 16, 2024).) In the absence of a controlling California court decision,
a court may consider the reasoning reflected in federal cases that apply
analogous statutes or rules. (Pollock v. Tri-Modal Distribution Services,
Inc. (2021) 11 Cal.5th 918, 936.) 
In addition, treatises concur with this conclusion.
(See, e.g., Michael Paul Thomas, California Civil Courtroom Handbook and
Desktop Reference § 10.24 (2023 ed.) (“Unlike substitute service on natural
persons, substitute service on entities does not require any prior attempt at
personal service.”); Robert I. Weil et al., California Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial ¶ 4:196 (2023 ed.) (“No such showing [of prior efforts
at personal service] is necessary for substitute service on entity defendants ....”).)
Furthermore, California's Judicial Council also
agrees that no such showing of prior efforts at personal service is necessary
for substitute service on entity defendants. (See Judicial Council Comment to
Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 415.20(a) (“If a defendant is a corporate or
noncorporate entity, service may be made in the first instance, in lieu of
delivery of process to a specified officer or employee of such entity personally,
by leaving the papers in his office.”).)
In reply, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cites to
federal district cases, and not California appellate cases. While Plaintiff
does cite to California case law, none of the cases address the issue at hand
and are not on point. 
As such, the court finds that reasonable diligence
is not required when serving a limited liability company. Thus, the motion to
quash is denied.
 
IV.          
CONCLUSION 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion to quash is DENIED.
Defendant is ordered to give notice.
