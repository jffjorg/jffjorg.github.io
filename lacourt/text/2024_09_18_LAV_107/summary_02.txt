And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The plaintiff, Julianne Theresa Ross, filed a complaint against the defendant, City of Los Angeles, and others, alleging a cause of action for premises liability/dangerous condition of public property arising out of her alleged trip and fall over an uneven sidewalk. The defendant moved to quash service of summons and complaint, arguing that the service was not proper.

The judge found that the proof of service complied with the statutory requirements and created a rebuttable presumption that service was proper. The defendant argued that there was no showing of reasonable diligence in serving the limited liability company, but the judge agreed with the plaintiff that reasonable diligence is not required for serving business entities.

The judge denied the defendant's motion to quash and ordered the defendant to give notice. The court's decision is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the California Corporations Code.
