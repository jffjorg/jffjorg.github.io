```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has tentatively ruled that the motion to seal the record in this unlawful detainer case should be granted. The defendants, Gonzalo Lizama, et al., have argued that an unsealed eviction judgment on their record would make them ineligible to rent affordable and habitable units in the future. The Court has found that this is an overriding interest that outweighs the right of public access to the record. The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored and no less restrictive means exist to preserve this interest. The Court has also found that there is no prejudice to the plaintiff in granting the motion, and the plaintiff has not argued otherwise.
