The judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint and dismisses the case with prejudice. The Court finds that the plaintiffs lack standing to bring derivative claims and that the allegations in the complaint do not plead facts sufficient to support the claims. The Court also finds that the defendants have a valid defense to the claims.
