ANALYSIS
Motion For
Attorney’s Fees
            Defendant/Judgment Creditor moves
for an award of interim attorney fees incurred between June 9,2023 and December
13, 2023 in the amount of $27,000.00. This is for attorney’s fees incurred
after the arbitration award issued on June 8, 2023 and due to
Plaintiff/Judgment Debtor’s failure to pay the award without the need for
subsequent enforcement proceedings.
            However, as Plaintiff/Judgment
Debtor points out, Defendant/Judgment Creditor took steps to enforce a judgment
that had not been entered. In this regard, the parties stipulated as follows by
way of a stipulation and order entered November 29, 2023:
Whereas, no formal
judgment was entered on October 20, 2023 or anytime thereafter, the parties agree to
the following stipulation:

and shall be of no force and effect
without prejudice to KS Steel re-filing new Notices of Lien after judgment is

     (Bold emphasis added.)
            As such, Defendant/Judgment Creditor
will not be awarded any attorney’s fees for the above. The only attorney’s fees
which will be awarded are those incurred in filing the petition to confirm
arbitration award and in opposition the petition to vacate the arbitration
award, which was denied.
            As moving party points out, there is
an attorney fee clause in the subcontract agreement (Complaint, Exh. B) at ¶
12.1, which provides as follows:
''In
the event it shall become necessary for either party to institute legal
proceedings against the other party for recovery of any amounts due and owing
under this Agreement, it is expressly agreed that the prevailing party in any
such action shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing party all
costs, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees, of pre-suit
collection attempts, suit, and post judgment or settlement collection including
those incurred on appeal."
The determination of reasonable
amount of attorney fees is within the sound discretion of trial courts. (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095; Akins
v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000) 79
Cal. App. 4th 1127, 1134.) “The determination of what constitutes a
reasonable fee generally ‘begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate….’”  “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal services
in the community; it may be adjusted by the court based on factors including,
as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved,
(2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature
of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the
contingent nature of the fee award….”  (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) In setting the hourly rate for an
attorney fees award, courts are entitled to consider the rate of “‘fees
customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community for similar
work.’" (Bihun v. AT&T
Information Systems, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal. App. 4th 976, 997 [affirming rate
of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 644,
664.)  The burden is on the party seeking
attorney fees to prove reasonableness of the fees. (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010)
188 Cal. App. 4th 603, 615.) 
The Court has broad discretion in
determining the amount of a reasonable attorney's fee award which will not be
overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law,
or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008)
167 Cal. App. 4th 1379, 1393-94.)  The
Court need not explain its calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded
in detail; identifying the factors considered in arriving at the amount will
suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Industries Inc.
(2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-75.) 
The Court finds the $450/hour rate to be reasonable. The Court finds that
32 hours is a reasonable amount of time spent on the petition to confirm
arbitration award and in opposing the petition to vacate arbitration award, as
well as to bring this motion for attorney’s fees. As such, the lodestar amount
is $14,400.00, which is the amount this Court will award in attorney’s fees. 
The motion for attorney’s fees is GRANTED in the reduced amount of
$14,400.
