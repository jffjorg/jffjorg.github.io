 Case Number:  22STCV08963    Hearing Date:   January 11, 2024    Dept:  76 The Court has reviewed and considered the ex parte
application of Plaintiff John Roe, and the opposition papers filed by Defendant
Big Brothers Big Sisters of America.  The
Court finds the matter to be appropriate for decision in chambers without
argument.
Code of Civil Procedure section 437c(h) provides that
requests to continue a hearing for further discovery “shall” be granted if
facts essential to justify opposition may exist but cannot, for reasons stated,
be presented.  As noted by the Court of
Appeal, requests for continuances should be liberally granted.  (Braganza v. Albertson’s LLC (2021) 67
Cal.App.5th 144, 152-53.)  However,
Braganza noted the split of opinion among Courts of Appeal regarding the role
of diligence (or lack thereof) in pursuing discovery when ruling on section
437c(h) continuance requests.  (Id. at
155.)  Among the cases noted by Braganza
was Cooksey v. Alexakis (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 246, in which the Court of
Appeal for the Second District held that the lack of diligence may be a basis
for denying a continuance.  This Court
finds Cooksey to be the most persuasive among the divergent authorities and
will apply its rule to this case.  The
chronology of discovery communications recounted by Defendant shows that in the
exercise of diligence, the requested discovery could have been obtained
sooner.  The Court considers it to be
very significant that the hearing on Defendant’s motion for summary judgment
was already continued once to allow additional time for the preparation of an
opposition, yet the record does not establish diligent effort to finalize any
discovery desired to prepare an opposition.
The ex parte application is DENIED.
