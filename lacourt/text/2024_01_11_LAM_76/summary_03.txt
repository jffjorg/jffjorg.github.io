And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has reviewed the ex parte application of Plaintiff John Roe and the opposition papers filed by Defendant Big Brothers Big Sisters of America. The Judge finds that the matter is appropriate for decision in chambers without argument. The Judge denies the ex parte application, citing the lack of diligence in pursuing discovery. The Judge notes that the Defendant's motion for summary judgment was previously continued, but the Plaintiff did not exercise diligence in finalizing discovery. The Judge applies the rule from Cooksey v. Alexakis (2004) that lack of diligence may be a basis for denying a continuance. The Judge concludes that the Plaintiff's request for continuance is denied.
