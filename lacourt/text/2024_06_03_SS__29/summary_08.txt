  - "The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings."

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court will continue the hearing on the motion for summary judgment filed by Moving Defendants, Inclusive Education and Community Partnership, Inc. and Wendy De La O. The court finds that the potential prejudice to the plaintiff from not granting a continuance to allow the motion to withdraw the admissions to be heard likely outweighs the prejudice to Moving Defendants from another continuance. The court will hear from counsel regarding (1) whether verified responses were served to the requests for admission and when, and (2) why the plaintiff did not file a motion to withdraw the admissions either concurrently with or before the opposition to this motion.
