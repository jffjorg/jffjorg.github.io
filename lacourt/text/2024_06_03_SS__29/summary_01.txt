And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendants' motions to compel the plaintiff's responses to their supplemental interrogatories and supplemental demand for inspection and production of documents. The plaintiff has failed to respond to the defendants' requests, and the defendants have met their burden of showing that the plaintiff's failure to respond is unreasonable. The judge also denies the defendants' requests for sanctions, as the plaintiff has not opposed the motions and the applicable statutes do not provide an independent basis to award sanctions. The judge orders the plaintiff to serve verified, written, code-compliant responses to the defendants' supplemental interrogatories and supplemental demand for inspection and production of documents within 14 days of notice.
