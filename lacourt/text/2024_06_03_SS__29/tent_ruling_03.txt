 Case Number:  20STCV48407    Hearing Date:   June 3, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses to Special
Interrogatories filed by Defendants Enterprise Rent-A-Car Company of Los
Angeles, LLC and EAN Holdings, LLC.
 
Tentative
 
The motion is granted.
 
The request for sanctions is denied.
 
Background
On December 18,
2020, Pedro Gaona (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Ayush Pandey,
Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Company, EAN Holding, and Does 1 to 25 for motor vehicle
negligence and general negligence causes of action arising from an automobile
accident occurring on December 29, 2018.
On April 11, 2024, Defendants Enterprise
Rent-A-Car Company of Los Angeles, LLC and EAN Holdings, LLC. (collectively
“Defendants”) filed this motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Special
Interrogatories. No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On February 11, 2024, Defendants
propounded Special Interrogatories on Plaintiff. (Boyd Decl., ¶ 4, see Exh. A.)  Defendants have yet to receive Plaintiff’s
response. (Id., ¶ 7.)
 
Defendants need show nothing more.
 
The
Court GRANTS Defendants’ motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Special Interrogatories.
 
Defendants’ request for sanctions are
DENIED. The applicable statute authorizes the imposition of sanctions
against a party or counsel who “unsuccessfully makes or opposes” a motion to
compel initial responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)  Plaintiff
has not opposed the motion.
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030,
subdivision (a), does not provide an independent basis to award sanctions; the
sanctions award must be “authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method or any other provision of this title.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030.) 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS the motion
to compel. 
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff
to serve verified, written, code compliant responses, without objections, to Defendants’
Special Interrogatories within 14 days of notice. 
 
The
Court DENIES Defendants’ request for sanctions.
 
Moving party
is ORDERED to give notice.
