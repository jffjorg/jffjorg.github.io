Background
On October 30, 2019, Sherleen Hudson
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Mona Alcala and Carlos Alcala for negligence
cause of action arising out of motor vehicle accident occurring on October 30,
2017. On May 26, 2021, Defendant Mona Mahdara Alcala filed an answer. On
February 14, 2022, Defendant Carlos Alcala filed an answer.
 
On May 6, 2024, Defendants Mona
Mahdara Alcala and Carlos Alcala (collectively “Defendants”) filed these motions
to compel Plaintiff to respond to Supplemental Interrogatories and Supplemental
Demand for Inspection for Production of Documents. 
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
“In addition to the number of interrogatories permitted
by Sections 2030.030 and 2030.040, a party may propound a supplemental
interrogatory to elicit any later acquired information bearing on all answers
previously made by any party in response to interrogatories.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.070, subd. (a).)
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
“In addition to the demands for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling permitted by this chapter, a party may propound a
supplemental demand to inspect, copy, test, or sample any later acquired or
discovered documents, tangible things, land or other property, or
electronically stored information in the possession, custody, or control of the
party on whom the demand is made.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.050, subd. (a).)
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When
a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) Requests for admission may be
propounded on a party without leave of court 10 days after the service of the
summons on, or appearance by that party, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.020(b).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
On February 15, 2024, Defendants
propounded Supplemental Interrogatories (Set One) and Supplemental Demand for
Inspection and Production of Documents (Set One) on Plaintiff. (Schmeckpeper
Decls., ¶ 2.)  Defendants have yet to
receive Plaintiff’s responses. (Motion for Supplemental Interrogatories,
Schmeckpeper Decl., ¶ 4; Motion for Supplemental Demand, Schmeckpeper Decl., ¶ 5.)
 
Defendants need show nothing more.
 
The
Court GRANTS Defendants’ motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Supplemental Interrogatories and Supplemental Demand for
Inspection and Production of Documents.
 
Defendants’ requests for sanctions are
DENIED.  The applicable statutes
authorize the imposition of sanctions against a party or counsel who “unsuccessfully
makes or opposes” a motion to compel initial responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c)
& 2031.300, subd. (c).)  Plaintiff
has not opposed the motion. 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a), does not provide an independent basis to award
sanctions; the sanctions award must be “authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.)  
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS the motions
to compel. 
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff
to serve verified, written, code compliant responses, without objections, to Defendants’
Supplemental Interrogatories within 14 days of notice.
