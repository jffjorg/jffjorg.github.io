The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) filed a motion to strike certain allegations in the First Amended Complaint filed by H.W. (the plaintiff). The plaintiff alleges that LAUSD is liable for the injuries suffered by H.W. as a result of a tragic accident at a Los Angeles high school. The court denied LAUSD's motion to strike, finding that the allegations in the First Amended Complaint are sufficient to state a cause of action against LAUSD. The court also found that LAUSD is a public entity and as such is not liable for an injury, but that school officials have an obligation to exercise ordinary care in supervising students.
