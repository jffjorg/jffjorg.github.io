Super Center Concepts, Inc. dba Superior Grocers.
 
Tentative
 
The motion is denied without prejudice.
 
Background
 
In
this matter (Case No. 22STCV20833, the “Gomez Action”), on June 27, 2022, Lydia
Marie Gomez (“Gomez”) filed the complaint asserting causes of action for
premises liability and general negligence against Defendant Superior Grocers and
Does 1 to 50. On March 8, 2024, Superior Grocers (“Superior”) filed an answer.
 
In
the other matter (Case No. 22STCV18557, the “CLC Action”), on June 6, 2022, The
Complete Logistics Company (“CLC”) filed a complaint against Super Center
Concepts, Inc., Superior Grocers, and Does 1
through 50 for subrogation. On July 28, 2022, Super Center Concepts,
Inc. dba Superior Grocers filed their answer.
 
On May 15, 2024, Superior filed this motion to
consolidate the cases. No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
“When
actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the
court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue
in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such
orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or
delay.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048 (a).)
 
The
trial court should not consolidate actions where prejudice would result any
party, e.g., when consolidation would cause a litigant to need to adopt adverse
litigations positions in a single trial. 
(See State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1956) 47 Cal.2d
428, 430.)
 
Per
Local Rule 3.3, subdivision (g), “Cases may not be consolidated unless they are
in the same department.  A motion to
consolidate two or more cases may be noticed and heard after the cases,
initially filed in different departments, have been related into a single
department, or if the cases were already assigned to that department.”  (Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule
3.3(g)(1).)  Once the Court relates the
cases, the Court may consolidate the actions and order a joint trial on matters
that “involv[e] a common question of law or fact.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §1048, subd. (a).) 
 
California
Rules of Court rule 3.350 states:
“(a)
Requirements of motion
(1)  A notice of
motion to consolidate must:
(A)  List all named
parties in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names of
their respective attorneys of record;
(B)  Contain the
captions of all the cases sought to be consolidated, with the lowest numbered
case shown first; and
(C)  Be filed in
each case sought to be consolidated.
 
(2)  The motion to
consolidate:
(A)  Is deemed a
single motion for the purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but
memorandums, declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in
the lowest numbered case; 
(B)  Must be served
on all attorneys of record and all nonrepresented parties in all of the cases
sought to be consolidated; and
(C)  Must have a
proof of service filed as part of the motion.”
 
Discussion
 
Notice
of Related Cases were filed in 22STCV20833 on March 13, 2024, and in
22STCV18557 on April 18, 2024. However, the cases are still in different
departments and have not deemed related into a single department. The
Department with the first filed case (Case No. 22STCV18557) must decide whether
the cases are related and, only if they are related may a party seek to
consolidate. (Local Rule 3.3(g).) 
 
Even if
the cases were properly related, the motion to consolidate does not meet the
detailed mandatory procedural requirements set forth in California Rules of
Court, rule 3.350(a).  Counsel must fully
comply with each of these requirements when filing a motion to consolidate. 
 
Therefore,
the Court DENIES the motion to consolidate 22STCV20833 and 22STCV18557without
prejudice.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES without prejudice the
motion to consolidate 22STCV20833
and 22STCV18557.
