And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has denied the Defendant's motion to consolidate the two cases, 22STCV20833 and 22STCV18557, without prejudice. The motion was filed by Superior Grocers, the Defendant in both cases, and sought to consolidate the cases due to common questions of law and fact. However, the Court ruled that the cases are still in different departments and have not been deemed related into a single department, as required by Local Rule 3.3. Additionally, the Court found that the motion to consolidate did not meet the detailed mandatory procedural requirements set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a). As a result, the Court denied the motion without prejudice.
