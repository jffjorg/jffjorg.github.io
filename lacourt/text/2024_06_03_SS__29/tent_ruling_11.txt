Tentative
The motion is denied
Background
On September 19, 2018, Cherise Fox
(“Plaintiff”) filed her action against City of Beverly Hills (“Defendant”) and
Does 1 through 100. Defendant filed an answer on November 5, 2018.
 
On June 9, 2022, the Court granted
Defendant’s motion for summary judgment. 
 
On August 8, 2022, Plaintiff filed an
appeal to the granting of Defendant’s motion for summary judgment. On October
26, 2022, a notice of default of the appeal was filed, giving Plaintiff the
deadline of November 11, 2022, to file the record on appeal.
 
On October 28, 2022, judgment was
entered against Plaintiff in this matter.
 
On December 8, 2022, Plaintiff’s
appeal was dismissed.  The remittitur
issued on February 8, 2023.
 
On August 3, 2023, an extension to file was granted to
Plaintiff, and her new deadline was September 30, 2023. A second extension was
given to file to November 15, 2023. On February 8, 2024, a Notice of
Non-Compliance of Default on Appeal was filed.
 
On March 6, 2024, Plaintiff’s appeal
was dismissed again. The Court denied Plaintiff’s motion to vacate the
dismissal on April 3, 2024.  The
remittitur issued on May 9, 2024.
 
On May 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
motion to augment record on appeal with the Superior Court. No opposition has
been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
“(1)  At any time, on motion of a party or its own
motion, the reviewing court may order the record augmented to include:
(A)  Any document filed or lodged in the case in
superior court; or
(B)  A certified transcript-or agreed or settled
statement-of oral proceedings not designated under rule 8.130. Unless the court
orders otherwise, the appellant is responsible for the cost of any additional
transcript the court may order under this subdivision.
(2)  A party must attach to
its motion a copy, if available, of any document or transcript that it wants
added to the record. The pages of the attachments must be consecutively
numbered, beginning with the number one. If the reviewing court grants the
motion it may augment the record with the copy.
(3)  If the party cannot
attach a copy of the matter to be added, the party must identify it as required
under rules 8.122 and 8.130.”
(California Rules of Court, rule 8.155, under Article 2 for Civil
Appeals.)
“[C]ourts of appeal have appellate jurisdiction when superior
courts have original jurisdiction in causes of a type within the appellate
jurisdiction of the courts of appeal on June 30, 1995, and in other causes
prescribed by statute.” (Cal. Const., art. VI, § 11.)
“An appeal, other than in a limited civil case, is to the court of
appeal... From a judgment.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 904.1(a).)
Discussion
Plaintiff
has filed a motion to augment the record. Under the Rules of the Court, the
motion must be directed to the Court of Appeal, not the Superior Court.  The Superior Court does not have the power to
grant the motion.
 
Accordingly,
the motion is denied.  
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion.
 
Moving party
is ORDERED to give notice.
