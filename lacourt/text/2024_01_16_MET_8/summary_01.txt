Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment filed by Subaru of America, Inc. and Subaru Pacific. The motion seeks to dismiss Vivianne Jean Coe's claims for breach of express and implied warranties related to the purchase of a used vehicle.

The judge has denied the motion as to the first cause of action for breach of express warranty, finding that the Song-Beverly Act applies to the sale of a used vehicle with a balance remaining on the manufacturer's new motor vehicle warranty. The judge notes that the Supreme Court of California has stated that Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 209 may be relied upon for its persuasive value or in establishing the existence of a conflict in authority, but it is not binding precedent.

The judge has also denied the motion as to the second cause of action for breach of implied warranty, finding that there is a triable issue of fact as to whether Subaru of America, Inc. is liable for breach of implied warranty. The judge notes that the parties have not provided sufficient evidence to resolve this issue and requests additional arguments and documents from the parties.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further briefing and argument from the parties.
