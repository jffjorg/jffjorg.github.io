COMPLAINT
  FILED: 4/5/24
 
TRIAL:
  None set
 



 
On April 5, 2024, Plaintiff Charles Moore filed this
action arising out of a motor vehicle accident that is alleged to have occurred
on April 6, 2022.  On October 1, 2024,
Russell F. Behjatnia, counsel for Plaintiff Charles Moore, filed a Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel.  Through his
declaration filed in support of the motion, Mr. Behjatnia asserts that “there
has been a breakdown of communication and cooperation by the client, to the
point that makes effective representation of the client impossible for the
attorney.”  Declaration in Support of
Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel, ¶ 2.
The court finds that Plaintiff was served with a copy
of the motion by mail, and that the service requirements of California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362 have been met.  Plaintiff
failed to file opposition to the motion. 
Based on the foregoing, the court GRANTS the motion of
attorney Russell F. Behjatnia to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Charles
Moore, to be effective upon moving party’s filing of a proof of service of a
copy of the signed order on Plaintiff, to include trial and final status
conference dates to be set by the court at the December 10, 2024 case
management conference to be conducted in this matter.  
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
