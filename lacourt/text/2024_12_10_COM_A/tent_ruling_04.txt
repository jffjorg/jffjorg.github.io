This is an unlawful detainer case. Plaintiff Veronica
Childs (Plaintiff) filed her First Amended Complaint (FAC) on July 9, 2024.  A proof of service of summons and complaint was
filed on July 9, 2024, indicating the FAC was personally served on Defendants
Erica Ortiz and Mario Acosta (Defendants) that same day.  The FAC alleges Defendants owe Plaintiff over
$38,000 in unpaid back rent and refuse to vacate Plaintiff’s property.  Defendants filed their demurrer to the FAC on
July 31, 2024.
On July 31, 2024, Defendants Erica Ortiz and Mario
Acosta filed a demurrer to the first cause of action of the FAC for unlawful
detainer on the grounds that the three-day notice to pay or quit alleged in the
FAC to have been served on Defendants was not served on Defendants on March 12,
2024, and the complaint therefore fails to state a cause of action.  Plaintiff did not file opposition to the
demurrer.  No reply was filed.
A tenant may demur to a UD complaint.  (Code of Civ. Proc. §1170.) A demurrer must
be filed within 5 days after service of the summons. See Code of Civ. Proc. §§1167,
1167.3, 1170.  The demurrer was filed on
July 31, 2024, 22 days after service of the summons on July 9, 2024.  Therefore, it was untimely and is overruled
on that ground.
The demurrer is also overruled on substantive
grounds.  A demurrer for sufficiency
tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda
(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747 (Hahn).)¿When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)¿In a
demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or via proper judicial notice.¿ (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the
evidence or other extrinsic matters.¿Therefore, it lies only where the defects
appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.”¿(SKF Farms v.
Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in
a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”¿(Hahn, supra, 147
Cal.App.4th at p. 747.)¿
The ultimate facts alleged in the complaint must be
deemed true, as well as all facts that may be implied or inferred from those
expressly alleged.¿(Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher (1995) 37
Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403; see also Shields v. County of San Diego
(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 103, 133 [stating, “[o]n demurrer, pleadings are read
liberally and allegations contained therein are assumed to be true.”]) “The
court does not, however, assume the truth of contentions, deductions or
conclusions of law. [Citation.]” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)
The FAC alleges at paragraphs 9-10 that the 3-day notice
to pay rent or quit was personally served on Defendants Erica Ortiz and Mario
Acosta on March 12, 2024, and that the period stated in that notice expired at
the end of the day on March 15, 2024.  Defendants
demur to the complaint on the grounds that Plaintiff fails to state a cause of
action because Plaintiff allegedly did not serve Defendants with the required
three-day notice to pay or quit on March 12, 2024. Because all factual
allegations in the complaint must be deemed true at the demurrer stage,
Defendants have not presented a valid argument as to why the complaint fails to
state a cause of action. 
Based on the foregoing, the court OVERRULES
Defendants’ demurrer to the unlawful detainer cause of action in the FAC.  Defendants are ordered to give notice.
