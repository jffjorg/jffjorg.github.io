And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the petition filed by Matthew Kashinsky, a minor, seeking relief from the requirements of the Government Claims Act. Kashinsky was injured while playing soccer at Rosecrans Elementary School and failed to file a government claim within the six-month deadline. Despite the denial of his application for leave to present a late claim, the judge finds that Kashinsky's failure to file the claim timely was due to mistake, inadvertence, and/or excusable neglect. The judge also notes that Kashinsky was a minor throughout the entire claim presentation period and that the application for leave was made within a reasonable time. Therefore, the judge grants the petition and orders relief from the claim statute requirements.
