And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendant's motion to establish admissions and to compel initial responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The ruling also grants the Defendant's request for sanctions against the Plaintiff and her counsel in the amount of $3,000. The Plaintiff had failed to respond to the Defendant's discovery requests, which were served on June 7, 2024. The Plaintiff had requested an extension of time to respond, which was granted until August 8, 2024, but still failed to respond. The Defendant filed motions to compel responses and deem requests for admission admitted on October 17, 2024, which the Plaintiff failed to oppose. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery requests was a misuse of the discovery process and ordered the Plaintiff to serve code-compliant responses to the Defendant's discovery requests within 14 days.
