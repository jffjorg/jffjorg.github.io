And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion for an order permitting discovery of the defendant's financial condition. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant's dog, Marley, bit her while she was walking on the sidewalk near the defendant's home, and she seeks to discover the defendant's financial condition to show malice. The defendant argues that the plaintiff cannot show malice and that the court should not permit discovery. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not demonstrated a substantial probability of success on her punitive damages claim and therefore has failed to meet the burden under Code of Civil Procedure section 3295, subdivision (c). The judge rules that the defendant's conduct, including not training Marley and videotaping the plaintiff after the incident, does not constitute malice as defined in the statute.
