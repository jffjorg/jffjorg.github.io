The repayment rights are related to intellectual property formerly held by Parallax and acquired by Data Health Partners, Inc. The motion is unopposed.

The judge has also noted that the judgment creditor may apply to the court for an order restraining the judgment debtor from assigning or disposing of the right to payment that is sought to be assigned.
