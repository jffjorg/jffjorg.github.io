Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for assignment order brought by judgment creditor Shahla Melamed against judgment debtor Parallax Health Sciences, Inc. The motion seeks to assign to Melamed the right, title, and/or interest in certain repayment rights held by Parallax in connection with a secured promissory note and royalty agreement. The repayment rights are related to intellectual property formerly held by Parallax and acquired by Data Health Partners, Inc. The motion is unopposed. The judge has determined that an assignment of the repayment rights would be appropriate, as there is no indication that the sought property supports any natural person, the judgment debtor has not paid Melamed anything on the $20,000,000+ judgment, and the stated value of the secured promissory note would almost fully satisfy the judgment. The judge has also noted that the judgment creditor may apply to the court for an order restraining the judgment debtor from assigning or disposing of the right to payment that is sought to be assigned.
