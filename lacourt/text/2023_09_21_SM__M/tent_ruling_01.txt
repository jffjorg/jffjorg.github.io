  Case Number:  19SMCV00329    Hearing Date:   September 21, 2023    Dept:  M CASE NAME:           Dutton, et
al., v. Domanavski, et al.
CASE NO.:                19SMCV00329
MOTION:                  Motion
to Deem Matters Admitted
HEARING DATE:   9/21/2023

 
Legal
Standard
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280(b), a
party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). “Failure
to timely respond to RFA does not result in automatic admissions. Rather,
the propounder of the RFA must ‘move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction’ under §
2023.010 et seq.” (CCP, § 2033.280(b).) The court “shall” grant the motion to
deem RFA admitted, “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance
with Section 2033.220.” (CCP, § 2033.280(c).) 
 
Analysis
 
            Plaintiff James Dutton moves for an
order deeming the truth of the facts, and the genuineness of the documents set
forth in Requests for Admission, Set Two, propounded to Defendant Robert
Ouriel.
 
            In opposition, Ouriel states that he
did not receive the motion until he requested it via email. However, he does
not rebut the presumption of service in light of the facially valid proof of
service.  In any event, the motion is
moot per the submission and service of substantially compliant responses prior
to the hearing on this matter. (Ouriel Decl., Ex. A.) On August 25, 2023,
Ouriel served counsel with responses to the RFAs, Set Two. Ouriel provides
proof of service via mail. (Id., Ex. B.) 
 
            Sanctions are still mandatory,
without exception. However, Plaintiff failed to notice any sanctions against
Ouriel. Therefore, sanctions cannot be granted.
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED
as moot.
