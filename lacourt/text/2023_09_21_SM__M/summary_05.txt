And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

Counsel Tatiana Ingman has moved to be relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiffs Bruce Glatman and Encore International LLC. The motion is based on the fact that the plaintiffs have failed to respond to attempts at communication, and an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship has occurred. Counsel has made reasonable attempts to contact the plaintiffs, but has been unable to confirm their current address. The judge finds that the clients will not be prejudiced by the withdrawal, and grants the motion tentatively. The order will be effective upon the filing of proof of service of the order on the client.
