Significant Statements:
  - "The anti-SLAPP statute does not insulate defendants from any liability for claims arising from the protected rights of petition or speech. It only provides a procedure for weeding out, at an early stage, meritless claims arising from protected activity." - Baral v. Schnitt
  - "The Court does not weigh evidence or resolve conflicting factual claims. Its inquiry is limited to whether the plaintiff has stated a legally sufficient claim and made a prima facie factual showing sufficient to sustain a favorable judgment." - Baral v. Schnitt
  - "Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded." - Stafford v. Shultz
```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the anti-SLAPP motion and sustains the demurrer to the second cause of action for unjust enrichment. The ruling grants the motion to strike certain allegations related to defamation and irrelevant to the breach of contract cause of action. The court also denies punitive damages and gives the plaintiff 10 days to file an amended complaint.

The ruling finds that the anti-SLAPP statute does not apply to the breach of contract cause of action because the allegations do not support a probability of success. The court also finds that the unjust enrichment cause of action is not a viable claim in California.

The ruling strikes certain allegations related to defamation because they are irrelevant to the breach of contract cause of action and ask for improper relief. The court also denies punitive damages because a breach of contract claim cannot support a punitive damages award.

The plaintiff has 10 days to file an amended complaint to address the issues raised in the tentative ruling.

* "The Court does not weigh evidence or resolve conflicting factual claims. Its inquiry is limited to whether the plaintiff has stated a legally sufficient claim and made a prima facie factual showing sufficient to sustain a favorable judgment." (Baral v. Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 384-385)
* "Claims with the requisite minimal merit may proceed." (Baral v. Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 384-385)
