Significant Statements:

* "The anti-SLAPP procedures are designed to shield a defendant's constitutionally protected conduct from the undue burden of frivolous litigation."
* "The anti-SLAPP statute does not insulate defendants from any liability for claims arising from the protected rights of petition or speech. It only provides a procedure for weeding out, at an early stage, meritless claims arising from protected activity."
* "Claims with the requisite minimal merit may proceed."
* "The public interest' within the meaning of the anti-SLAPP statute has been broadly defined to include, in addition to government matters, 'private conduct that impacts a broad segment of society and/or that affects a community in a manner similar to that of a governmental entity."
* "Siegemund made untrue statements and outright lies, at the above listed places, locations, internet sites, and on social media, that she was 'fired' from the School for 'loving America', 'fired' as a teacher for 'teaching while conservative', and for 'defending western civilization'."
```

The judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to strike the trade libel claim is denied as it has minimal merit, but the motion to strike the breach of contract claim is denied as the School has shown that Siegemund breached the contract and that the damages claimed are not unlawful under Labor Code section 221. The judge also grants Siegemund leave to file a motion for attorneys' fees and costs incurred in bringing this motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16(c)(1).
