English text:
This tentative ruling is for the case of Cutze Product LLC, et al., v. Scaling Group LLC, et al., case number 22SMCV02220, scheduled for a hearing on September 21, 2023. The plaintiff, Seller Partner LLC, has moved to compel initial discovery responses from the defendant, Scaling Group LLC, regarding form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The plaintiff also requests sanctions against the defendant and its counsel. The defendant opposes the sanctions request against counsel.

The court finds that the plaintiff served the discovery sets at issue and the defendant received them, but failed to respond. The defendant's counsel explains that there has been no communication with the defendant or its principal, Alex Martino, since March 2023. Therefore, the court grants the plaintiff's motion to compel discovery responses.

Regarding sanctions, the court finds that they are mandatory unless the imposition of sanctions would be unjust or the party subject to the sanctions acted with substantial justification. The plaintiff requests $1,570.00 in sanctions, which includes attorney and paralegal fees, and filing fees. However, no reply was submitted. Therefore, the plaintiff's request for sanctions is granted in the reduced total amount of $1,570.00, against the defendant only. The sanctions must be paid within 30 days.
