And here is the English-text summary:

The judge issues a tentative ruling on a motion to compel initial discovery responses from the defendant, Scaling Group LLC, and sanctions for the defendant's failure to respond. The plaintiff, Cutze Product LLC, served three discovery sets, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents, but the defendant failed to respond. The defense counsel admits receipt of the discovery demands, but claims that they have had no communication with the defendant or its principal, Alex Martino, since March 2023, making it impossible for them to respond. The judge grants the motion to compel discovery responses and sanctions the defendant in the amount of $1,570.00, payable within 30 days.
