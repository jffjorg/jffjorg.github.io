The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to deem matters admitted.

```

## English Summary:

In this case, Plaintiff James Dutton filed a motion to deem certain facts and documents admitted by Defendant Robert Ouriel.  

The court determined that the motion was moot because Defendant Ouriel served substantially compliant responses to the Requests for Admission prior to the hearing. Although sanctions are generally mandatory for failure to respond to RFAs, the Plaintiff did not request any sanctions in this instance, so the court could not grant them. 

As a result, the court denied the Plaintiff's motion as moot.

## English Summary

The judge reviewed a motion filed by Plaintiff Dutton to have certain facts and documents deemed admitted by Defendant Ouriel. The motion was based on Ouriel's late response to a set of Requests for Admission (RFAs). 

However, Ouriel submitted a response to the RFAs before the hearing, which the judge found to be substantially compliant. Because Ouriel responded in time, the judge denied the motion as moot.

Although sanctions are typically mandatory in these situations, the judge noted that Plaintiff Dutton failed to request sanctions against Ouriel, so they could not be granted.

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to deem matters admitted in the case of Dutton, et al. v. Domanavski, et al. (Case No. 19SMCV00329). The plaintiff, James Dutton, moved for an order deeming the truth of the facts and the genuineness of the documents set forth in Requests for Admission, Set Two, propounded to the defendant, Robert Ouriel. The defendant opposed the motion, claiming that he did not receive it until he requested it via email, but failed to rebut the presumption of service in light of the facially valid proof of service.
