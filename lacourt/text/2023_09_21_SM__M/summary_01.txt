The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to deem matters admitted. The plaintiff, James Dutton, moved for an order deeming the truth of certain facts and the genuineness of certain documents admitted. The defendant, Robert Ouriel, did not respond to the motion until he requested it via email, but did not rebut the presumption of service in light of facially valid proof of service. Additionally, Ouriel provided proof of service of substantially compliant responses to the requests for admission prior to the hearing. The judge has denied the motion as moot, as the responses to the requests for admission were served prior to the hearing. The judge also notes that sanctions are still mandatory, but since the plaintiff failed to notice any sanctions against the defendant, sanctions cannot be granted.

## English Summary:

In this case, Plaintiff James Dutton filed a motion to deem certain facts and documents admitted by Defendant Robert Ouriel.  

The court determined that the motion was moot because Defendant Ouriel served substantially compliant responses to the Requests for Admission prior to the hearing. Although sanctions are generally mandatory for failure to respond to RFAs, the Plaintiff did not request any sanctions in this instance, so the court could not grant them. 

As a result, the court denied the Plaintiff's motion as moot.

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a motion filed by Plaintiff James Dutton seeking an order to deem the truth of certain facts and the genuineness of documents admitted.
