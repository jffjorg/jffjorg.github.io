On March 29, 2024, defendant Veronica
Morales Banta, M.D. (“Defendant”) filed this motion for an order compelling
plaintiff Peter Richards (“Plaintiff”) to serve verified responses, without
objections, to Demand for Production and Inspection of Documents, Set One within
10 days of the hearing and to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,811.65. 
Defendant propounded on January 12,
2024. 
If a party to whom inspection demands
are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling their response. (Code Civ.Proc., § 2031.300.) 
Here, the motion to compel is unopposed
and there is no dispute that Plaintiff did not serve responses to Defendant’s
written discovery. Accordingly, Defendant’s motion is GRANTED and Plaintiff is
ORDERED to serve verified responses, without objections, to Demand for
Production and Inspection of Documents, Set One within 10 days of the date of
this order. 
The Court further imposes sanctions in
the reduced amount of $311.65, consisting of 1 hour at defense counsel’s hourly
rate of $250 and $61.65 in filing fees, payable within 10 days of the date of
this order. 
          Moving party
to give notice. 
Dated
this 19th
day of July, 2024
