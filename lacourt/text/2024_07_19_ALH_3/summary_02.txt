And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Porsche Leasing Ltd. and Porsche Financial Services, Inc. (plaintiffs) versus Junkui Peng (defendant). The plaintiffs have applied for a default judgment, but the application is defective because it does not include an interest calculation showing the basis for their request for $6,485.01 in prejudgment interest. The default prove-up hearing is continued to a future date, and the plaintiffs are required to include an interest calculation in their application. The judge advises parties who intend to submit on this tentative to send an email to the court and be prepared for the possibility that opposing parties may still appear at the hearing.
