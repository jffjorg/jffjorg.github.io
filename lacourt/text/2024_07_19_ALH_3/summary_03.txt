And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Porsche Leasing Ltd. and Porsche Financial Services, Inc. (Plaintiffs) vs. Xusheng An (Defendant). The Plaintiffs have applied for a default judgment, but their application is defective because they did not include an interest calculation showing the basis for their request for $6,943.84 in prejudgment interest. As a result, the default prove-up hearing is continued to a later date, and the Plaintiffs are required to complete the interest calculation before the hearing can proceed. The judge has ordered the parties to submit on the tentative ruling by email and has warned that the opposing party may still appear at the hearing to argue the matter, even if the submitting party does not appear.
