And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by plaintiff Frederick Wayne Smith. The plaintiff has requested to appear at the hearing via Zoom due to difficulties participating in the proceeding due to incarceration. The court has permitted remote video appearances through LA Court Connect and telephonic appearances. The plaintiff does not need a court order to appear remotely.

The plaintiff has also filed a motion for emergency granting of awards and community property, seeking $250,000.00. The plaintiff alleges that he and defendant Irma Lee Smith jointly own real property at 150 E. 99th Street in Los Angeles as community property, and that the defendant sold the property. The court has denied the plaintiff's motions. The court finds that the relief sought by the plaintiff is not a proper part of this proceeding, as the dispute over the real property is a new and separate dispute that must be resolved in a new civil action. The plaintiff's complaint was filed in June 2018, alleging defendant Irma Lee Smith was liable for various acts not related to selling the real property on 99th Street in Los Angeles. The action was dismissed in September 2018.
