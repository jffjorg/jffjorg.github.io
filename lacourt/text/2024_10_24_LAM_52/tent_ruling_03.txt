 Case Number:  BC710454    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Frederick Wayne
Smith’s Motion and Request for Zoom and Motion for Emergency Granting of Awards
of Community Property
Plaintiff Frederick Wayne Smith filed a motion
labeled “motion and request for zoom.” 
He seeks to appear at this hearing via Zoom.  The court understands that plaintiff faces
difficulties participating in this proceeding because he is incarcerated.  The court does not use Zoom software but
permits remote video appearances through LA Court Connect.  The court also permits telephonic
appearances.  No court order is
necessary.  
Plaintiff Frederick Wayne Smith also filed a motion
labeled “motion for emergency granting of awards and community property and
requested $250,000.00 and or at an modicum according to proof pursuant to the
lawsuit and executing lis pendens.”  He
asserts he and defendant Irma Lee Smith jointly own real property at 150 E.
99th Street in Los Angeles as community property, and defendant sold the
property.  
The relief plaintiff moves for is not a proper part
of this proceeding.  Plaintiff filed the
complaint in this action in June 2018. 
His complaint alleges defendant Irma Lee Smith was liable for various
acts not related to selling the real property on 99th Street in Los Angeles.  This action was dismissed in September
2018.  The dispute over real property is a
new and separate dispute.  Instead of
filing a motion in this proceeding, plaintiff must commence a new civil action over
that dispute.
Plaintiff Frederick Wayne Smith’s motions are denied.
