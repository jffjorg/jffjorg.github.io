  Case Number:  19STLC07446    Hearing Date:   September 28, 2023    Dept:  25  State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v. Rogers   19STLC07446 ANALYSIS:   I.                 Background               Subrogation  action.  Plaintiff’s insured was injured  in an auto v. auto accident with Defendant William Rogers that resulted in  damages to insured in the amount of $17,542.47.                  Plaintiff  and Defendant entered into a settlement agreement and notice of settlement was  filed on November 8, 2021.  A stipulation  and order for dismissal of the action with retention of jurisdiction per CCP  §664.6 was entered on May 18, 2022.     Complaint filed on 8/12/19 Subrogation   II.               Legal Standard                “If parties to pending litigation  stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court  or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the  court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties  to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the  settlement.” (CCP §664.6.)               “Section 664.6 was enacted to  provide a summary procedure for specifically enforcing a settlement contract  without the need for a new lawsuit.”  (Weddington  Productions, Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 809.)  “The statute recognizes that a settlement may  be summarily enforced in either of two situations: where the settlement was  made orally before the trial court or where it was made in writing outside the  presence of the court.”  (Elyaoudayan  v. Hoffman (2003) 104 Cal.App.4th 1421, 1428.)  Disputes regarding the terms of the  settlement (or other disputed facts) may be adjudicated on a CCP § 664.6  motion, on the basis of declarations or other evidence.  (Malouf Bros. v. Dixon (1991) 230  Cal.App.3d 280, 284.)               Once an action is dismissed, the  court loses jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter of the suit.  (Wackeen, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th  at 437.  However, pursuant to CCP §664.6,  “[i]f requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the  parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the  settlement.”  Thus, a court may retain  jurisdiction under CCP 664.6, notwithstanding dismissal, but only if a proper  request for retention of jurisdiction is made by the parties.  (Id. at 439-440 (unless parties  presented trial court with a proper request to retain jurisdiction for purposes  of section 664.6 motions, trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction  over action to enforce settlement post-dismissal).)                III.             Discussion               Plaintiff and Defendant entered into  a settlement agreement on May 4, 2022.   (Reese Dec., ¶2, Ex. A.)  The  Court properly retained jursidction pursuant to CCP §664.6 in the Stipulation  and Order of Dismissal entered on May 18, 2022.   (Id. at ¶3.)                Defendant was required to pay $9000  in full settlement of the action as follows:   an initial payment of $5000 by December 20, 2021; then beginning in  February 2022, monthly payment sof $50 until payment in full of the $9000  settlement.  (Id. at ¶2, Ex. A,  ¶2.)  The initial payment of $5000 was  made and $200 worth of monthly payments thereafter.  (Id. at ¶¶4 and 5.)  Defendant then default and Plaintiff mailed  Defendant notice of default on August 2, 2023, informing him of the 14- day  period to cure the default.  (Id.  at ¶7.)  No payment was made.  (Id.)   Plaintiff establishes Defendant’s  default on the settlement agreement and an outstanding balance of $3800, plus  costs in the amount of $509.50, for a total of $4,309.  (Id. at ¶8.).  Plaintiff’s motion to vacate dismissal and  entry of judgment pursuant to CCP §664.6 is granted.     IV.             Conclusion & Order   Plaintiff’s  Motion to Vacate Dismissal and Entry of Judgment pursuant to CCP §664.6 is  GRANTED.  Judgment is entered against  Defendant William Roger in the principal amount of $3800 plus costs in the  amount of $509.50.   Counsel for Plaintiff is ordered to serve and electronically submit a  (proposed) Judgment (without any attachments) in conformity with this Court's Tentative Ruling within (10) days.
