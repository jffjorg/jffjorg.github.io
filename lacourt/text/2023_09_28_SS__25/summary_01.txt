And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion to vacate dismissal and entry of judgment filed by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (Plaintiff) against William Rogers (Defendant). The case involves a subrogation action arising from an auto v. auto accident in which Plaintiff's insured was injured, resulting in damages of $17,542.47. The parties entered into a settlement agreement on May 4, 2022, which required Defendant to pay $9,000 in full settlement of the action. However, Defendant failed to make payments, and Plaintiff mailed a notice of default on August 2, 2023. Since no payment was made, Plaintiff establishes Defendant's default on the settlement agreement and an outstanding balance of $3,800, plus costs of $509.50, for a total of $4,309. The Judge grants Plaintiff's motion to vacate dismissal and entry of judgment, and orders judgment to be entered against Defendant William Rogers in the principal amount of $3,800 plus costs in the amount of $509.50.
