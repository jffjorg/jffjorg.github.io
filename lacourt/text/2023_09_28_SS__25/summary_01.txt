And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a subrogation action brought by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company against William Rogers. The case stems from an auto accident in which Rogers' vehicle collided with an insured party, resulting in damages of $17,542.47. The parties entered into a settlement agreement and notice of settlement was filed on November 8, 2021. The court retained jurisdiction under CCP §664.6 in a stipulation and order for dismissal entered on May 18, 2022.

The settlement agreement required Rogers to pay $9,000 in full, with an initial payment of $5,000 by December 20, 2021, and monthly payments of $50 beginning in February 2022. However, Rogers defaulted on the agreement and the plaintiff mailed him notice of default on August 2, 2023. Despite being given 14 days to cure the default, Rogers failed to make any payments.

The plaintiff's motion to vacate dismissal and entry of judgment pursuant to CCP §664.6 is granted. Judgment is entered against Rogers in the principal amount of $3,800 plus costs of $509.50.
