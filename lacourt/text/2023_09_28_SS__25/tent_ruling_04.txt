 Case Number:  22STLC08146    Hearing Date:   September 28, 2023    Dept:  25  Western Surety Company v.  AFDI Construction,  Inc.  22STLC08146 ANALYSIS:   I.                 Background               Plaintiff  provided a bond to Defendant AFDI Construction, Inc. in the amount of  $15,000.  The bond was cancelled  effective November 3, 2022.  Plaintiff  alleges various claimants/defendants, including Defendant Lisa Barreras and  Defendant Farris Tarazi, allege that AFDI has committed some act giving rise to  liability on the bond.  AFDI denies  liability.  On 12-7-21, Plaintiff filed  this action for interpleader against AFDI, Barreras and Tarazi.                 Default was  entered against AFDI on 5-2-23.   Defendant Tarazi filed an answer on 2-24-23.  Defendant Barreras’s default was set aside by  stip and order on 5-1-23.  Barreras filed  an answer on 4-26-23.      II.               Legal Standard                Interpleader is  proper whenever “double or multiple claims are made … by two or more persons …  such that they may [expose the person against whom the claims are asserted] …  to double or multiple liability …”  CCP §  386(b).  “The true test of suitability  for interpleader is the stakeholder's disavowal of interest in the property  sought to be interpleaded, coupled with the perceived ability of the court to  resolve the entire controversy as to entitlement to the property without need  for the stakeholder to be a party to the suit.”   (Pacific Loan Mgmt. Corp. v. Sup.Ct. (Armstrong) (1987) 196  Cal.App.3d 1485, 1489-1490.)                 “The function of an interpleader action is to eliminate  the risk of incorrectly resolving conflicting claims. When a disagreement  arises as to the ownership of said property, the holder thereof has not  obligated himself to settle said disagreement and deliver the property to  either of said parties in the face of conflicting claims thereto.”  (Southern California Gas Co. v. Flannery  (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 477, 489 (citing Pacific Loan Management Corp., supra  and Cantu v. Resolution Trust Corp. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 857, 876  (stakeholder not obligated to “resolve the apparent dispute without the consent  of the competing claimants”).)                 “Typical” situations permitting interpleader include “a  bank escrow holder faced with conflicting claims of vendor, purchaser and  purchaser's assignee; an escrow holder of a fund where one claimant notified  the escrow holder that the contract was cancelled and nothing should be paid to  the other claimant; and an insurance company admitting liability under a life  insurance policy where conflicting claims to the proceeds existed.”  (Pacific Loan Mgmt., supra, 196  Cal.App.3d at 1490.)                 “A complaint in interpleader must show that the  defendants make conflicting claims to the subject matter, and that the  plaintiff cannot safely determine which claim is valid and offers to deposit  the money in court.  The right to the  remedy of interpleader is founded on the consideration that a person is  threatened not just with double liability, but with double vexation in respect  to one liability.  An interpleader action,  however, may not be maintained upon the mere pretext or suspicion of double  vexation; the plaintiff must allege facts showing a reasonable probability of  double vexation or a valid threat of double vexation.”  (Westamerica Bank v. City of Berkeley  (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 598, 607–608.)               “An  interpleader action is traditionally viewed as two suits: one between the  stakeholder and the claimants to determine the stakeholder's right to  interplead, and the other among the claimants to determine who shall receive  the funds interpleaded…As against the stakeholder, claimants may raise only  matters which go to whether the suit is properly one for interpleader, i.e.,  whether the elements of an interpleader action are present.”  (State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Pietak  (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 600, 612; see also Dial 800 v. Fesbender (2004)  118 Cal.App.4th 32, 43.)                “A party to an action who follows the procedure set forth  in Section 386 or 386.5 may insert in his motion, petition, complaint, or cross  complaint a request for allowance of his costs and reasonable attorney fees  incurred in such action. In ordering the discharge of such party, the court  may, in its discretion, award such party his costs and reasonable attorney fees  from the amount in dispute which has been deposited with the court. At the time  of final judgment in the action the court may make such further provision for  assumption of such costs and attorney fees by one or more of the adverse  claimants as may appear proper.”  (CCP  §386.6(a).)   III.             Discussion    Western Surety moves for an order  allowing it to deposit the fully penalty of Bond No. 65155751 in the amount of  $15,000 issued on behalf of Defendant AFDI Construction.  Western Surety argues it is a mere  stakeholder with no interest in the funds and should be discharged from all  liability asserted against the funds.   Western Surety also asks that the Court award it reasonable attorney’s  fees in the amount of $1200.   Western Surety provided a contractor’s  bond to AFDI in the amount of $15,000 pursuant to Bus. & Prof. C. §7071.6.  Western Surety establishes that this action  is the type for which interpleader is proper.   Western Surety has no interest in the $15,000 bond and multiple  claimants have made claims against that amount, and the Court’s resolution of  the competing claims asserted by Barreras, Tarazi and AFDI does not require  Western Surety’s presence in the litigation.      Western Surety is entitled to  recovery of attorney’s fees and costs for interpleading the disputed funds  pursuant to CCP §386.6.  Western Surety  requests fees and costs in the amount of $1200.   The amount requested is reasonable and is less than the amount set forth  in the itemized bills submitted by Wester Surety.  (Motion, Sosa Dec., ¶6, Ex. 1.)     IV.             Conclusion & Order   Plaintiff  Western Surety’s Motion to Deposit by Stakeholder; for Discharge of Stakeholder, Restraining Order, Interpleader, and Request for Attorney’s Fees pursuant to CCP §386.6 is GRANTED.  Plaintiff is awarded $1200 in reasonable fees  and costs to be distributed from the disputed funds.  The Court notes no oppositions were  filed.  TRIAL REMAINS SET FOR JUNE  5, 2024 AT 8:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 25 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.   Moving party is  ordered to give notice.
