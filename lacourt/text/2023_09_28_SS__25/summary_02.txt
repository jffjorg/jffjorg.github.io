## Judge's Tentative Ruling Summary:


The judge finds that Defendants' motion to vacate the default and default judgment is untimely. They filed the motion more than six months after the default was entered, making it beyond the jurisdictional deadline set by CCP §473(b). 

While the judge acknowledges that Defendants were likely not properly served with the original complaint and summons, even if true, this does not excuse their failure to respond within the statutory timeframe. 

The judge notes that Defendants can still move for relief under CCP §473(d) based on the void judgment, but they must do so within two years of the default judgment.

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Saucedo v. Carcamo, et al. (21STLC06375). The case involves a dispute between Plaintiff Saucedo and Defendants Carcamo, Shugart, and All Black Form, who were hired to produce design plans for the development of two lots owned by Saucedo.

The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants' design plans were unsuitable for the project and that they refused to return payment when Saucedo demanded changes. The Plaintiff filed a complaint and the Defendants withdrew from the project. The Plaintiff then filed a motion to set aside the default and default judgment entered against the Defendants.

The Judge has denied the motion, finding that it is untimely. The motion was filed more than six months after the entry of default, which is the deadline for seeking discretionary relief under CCP §473(b). The Judge also found that the Defendants were not properly served with the complaint and summons, and that the default and default judgment are therefore void.

The Judge noted that a defendant is under no duty to respond to a defectively served summons, and that actual knowledge of the action does not dispense with statutory requirements for service of summons. The Judge also found that substitute service can only be rendered at a defendant's dwelling house, usual place of business, or usual mailing address, and that the Defendants were not properly served with the complaint and summons.

Finally, the Judge noted that a valid proof of service gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of valid service, and that the Defendants have provided sufficient evidence to rebut this presumption. The Judge therefore denied the motion to set aside the default and default judgment.

English text:
The Judge's tentative ruling is a denial of Defendants Carcamo and Shugart's motion to set aside default and default judgment pursuant to CCP §473(b) as untimely. The Judge states that the motion for discretionary relief was filed on 7/12/23, more than six months after entry of default on 12/20/21. The Judge also mentions that Defendants were never properly served with the complaint and summons, and that they did not move for relief from default and default judgment based on CCP §473(d), "void judgment or order." However, if Defendants choose to move for relief based on CCP §473(d), such a motion is subject to a two-year deadline measured from the date of entry of default judgment.
