```

Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the motion of Defendants Carcamo and Shugart to set aside the default and default judgment entered against them. The court finds that the motion is untimely, filed more than six months after entry of default, and that the default and default judgment were void ab initio because Defendants were never properly served with the complaint and summons. The court also notes that Defendants did not move for relief under CCP §473(d) and that the court cannot grant relief from void judgment or order sua sponte.
