The Defendant is seeking to propound additional discovery in the form of RFAs, form interrogatories, requests for production, and special interrogatories, alleging that the Plaintiff failed to produce certain phone records that are crucial to the Defendant's defense. The Judge is continuing the motion because the Defendant failed to provide proof of service for the motion, and the discovery cutoff expired on July 29, 2023. The Judge is requiring the Defendant to provide proof of service in conformity with CCP sections 1005 and 1013 at least 16 court days before the next scheduled hearing, or the motion will be placed off calendar or denied.
