Significant Statements:
  - "Typical" situations permitting interpleader include situations where one claimant notifies the escrow holder that the contract was cancelled and nothing should be paid to the other claimant.
  - "The true test of suitability for interpleader is the stakeholder's disavowal of interest in the property sought to be interpleaded, coupled with the perceived ability of the court to resolve the entire controversy as to entitlement to the property without need for the stakeholder to be a party to the suit."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Western Surety Company's motion to deposit the bond amount of $15,000 and to be discharged from all liability. Western Surety Company argues it is a mere stakeholder with no interest in the funds and should be discharged from all liability asserted against the funds. The judge finds that this is a proper case for interpleader, as multiple claimants have made claims against the bond amount and the court's resolution of the competing claims does not require Western Surety's presence in the litigation. The judge also awards Western Surety Company reasonable attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $1200 to be distributed from the disputed funds. The trial remains set for June 5, 2024.
