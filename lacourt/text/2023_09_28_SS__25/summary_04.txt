And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Western Surety Company's motion to deposit the bond amount of $15,000 and to be discharged from all liability. Western Surety Company argues it is a mere stakeholder with no interest in the funds and should be discharged from all liability asserted against the funds. The judge finds that this is a proper case for interpleader, as multiple claimants have made claims against the bond amount and the court's resolution of the competing claims does not require Western Surety's presence in the litigation. The judge also awards Western Surety Company reasonable attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $1200 to be distributed from the disputed funds. The trial remains set for June 5, 2024.
