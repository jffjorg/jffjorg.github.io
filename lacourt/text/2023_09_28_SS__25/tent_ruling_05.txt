 Case Number:  23STCP00521    Hearing Date:   September 28, 2023    Dept:  25  GKL Properties v. Diaz  23STCP00521ANALYSIS:   I.                 Background   On February 21, 2023, Petitioner  GKL Properties, dba Lamplighter Mobilehome Park (“Petitioner”) filed the instant Verified Petition  for Injunctive Relief (“Petition”) against Respondents Leonard Diaz (“Diaz”)  and Christine Allocer (“Allocer”), (collectively  “Respondents”).  The Petition seeks to  enjoin Respondents from violating the terms of the Rental Agreement and  Petitioner’s Park Rules and Regulations under Civil Code § 798.88.  (Pet. p. 1, Prayer.)    Respondent Allocer was personally served with the  Notice and Petition on June 1, 2023.  (6-2-23 Proof of Service.)   Respondent Diaz was served by substituted service with the Notice and Petition  on June 1, 2023.  (6-2-23 Proof of Service.)    On June 27, 2023, the Court  continued the hearing on the Petition to August 9, 2023 and ordered Petitioner  to file supplemental papers addressing the Court’s Order.  (June 27, Minute  Order.)    On August 9, 2023, the Court issued a  tentative ruling denying the Petition.   The Court continued the hearing date to September 28, 2023 so that it  could consider supplemental declarations filed by Plaintiff on August 8, 2023.    No opposition has been filed.    II.               Legal Standard    The Mobilehome Residency Law (“MRL”) gives  management an injunctive relief remedy for violations of “reasonable” park  rules and regulations.  (Civ. Code §  798.88.)  “In accord with City of  Oceanside v. McKenna [(1989)] 215 Cal.App.3d 1420, 264 Cal.Rptr. 275, we employ  a balancing test to determine the validity of the restriction.” (Rancho  Santa Paula Mobilehome Park, Ltd.  v. Evans (1994) 26  Cal.App.4th 1139, 1147.)     Management may obtain a restraining order  against a continuing or recurring violation of any “reasonable rule or  regulation.”  (Civ. Code, § 798.88(b); Rancho  Santa Paula Mobilehome Park, Ltd. v. Evans (1994)  26 Cal.App.4th 1139, 1142.)  At  the time of the hearing, the court shall issue the injunction if it finds by  clear and convincing evidence the existence of a continuing or recurring  violation of a “reasonable rule or regulation.”   (Civ. Code, § 798.88(d).)  The  duration of the injunction may not exceed three years.  (Civ. Code, § 798.88(d).)   III.             Discussion    Respondents are homeowners and  reside at 2662 Mountain View Road, Space 5, El Monte, California, 91731, within  the Lamplighter Mobilehome Park owned and operated by Petitioner.  (Pet. ¶¶ 2-4.)  Petitioner seeks an order enjoining  Respondents’ violations of the Park’s governing Rules and Regulations  (“Rules”).  (Pet. p. 1.)   On June 27, 2023, the Court noted  that the statements made in the Petition are not supported by any declarations  of witnesses, custodians of records, or anyone else with firsthand knowledge of  the events recounted in the Petition.   (6-27-23 Minute Order.)  Although,  the Petition is verified by Karen Loucks, authorized agent for Petitioner, the  Court cannot not discern whether Petitioner’s agent has firsthand knowledge of  the information presented in the Petition.   (Ibid.)  Thus, these  statements could potentially constitute hearsay and be inadmissible as  evidence.  (Ibid.; Evid. Code § 1200, et seq.)  For this reason, the Court continued the  hearing on the Petition and ordered Petitioner to file one or more declarations  presenting admissible evidence in support of the Petition.  (Ibid.)   On August 9, 2023, the Court  noted that as of the date of the continued hearing on the Petition, no  supplemental papers had been filed.   However, supplemental declarations were filed on August 8, 2023 and the  matter was continued to September 28, 2023 so that the supplemental declarations  could be considered.     Petitioner claims Respondents are  in violation of multiple Rules and Regulations of the mobilehome park and the  City of El Monte Municipal Code.   Specifically, Respondents have (1) failed to repair a water leak from  their coach, resulting in leaking sewage, nor have they allowed Petitioner’s  plumber to fix the leak; (2) stored improper items on the space, including  boxes, trunks, wood, pipe, bottles, garden tools, mops, ladders and paint cans;  (3) failed to repair damage to the home, including broken windows, damaged  siding and damaged piping; and (4) engaged in harassing behavior towards Park  management.  (Petition, ¶¶7-34.)  Respondents violations of the Rules and  Regulations of the Park span several years, beginning in September 2019 and  continuing to the present.  (Id.)   In support of the petition,  Petitioner submits the declaration of Jaime Zometa, the park manager.  Zometa testifies that Respondents Diaz and  Allocer are homeowners and reside at 2662 Mountain View Road, Space 5, El  Monte, CA pursuant to a rental agreement with Petitioner.  (Zometa Dec., ¶1.)  An authenticated copy of the park rules are attached  as Exhibit B to the Petition.  (Id.  at ¶2, Ex. B.)  The Rental Agreement  incorporates the Rules and Regulations.  (Petition,  Ex. A, ¶14, p. 13.)     Zometa  personally observed Respondents’ violations of the Park Rules and Regulations,  including their failure to repair a water/sewage leak from their coach and  their storage of improper items and vehicles at the park.  (Zometa Dec. at ¶¶5, 10, 15, 19, 21, 23, 24,  26-29.)  Zometa also personally observed  their refusal to comply with multiple notices and requests to cure these  violations.  (Id. at ¶¶6, 7, 11,  12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22.)  These notices to  comply are attached to the Petition as Exhibits C-J.  (Petition, Exs. C-J.)  Zometa took photographs of Respondents’  mobilehome and space condition on March 2, 2023 and the photographs establish  violations based on improper storage of items and vehicles, as well as the  failure to maintain the mobile home in a clean and sanitary condition.  (Zometa Dec., Ex. K.)   Zometa’s  declaration is clear and convicning evidence of the following violations of the  Park Rules and Regulations, attached as Exhibit B to the Petition: (1) 9(C)(11)(water  cannot puddle or stand and respondent must ensure it drains away from home into  street but not onto other homesites or common areas)(Petition, Ex. B, p. 8);  (2) 9(D)(7)(water  cannot overflow into street or onto yards of other residents)(Id.);  (3) 10(A)  (storage of items beneath, behind or on outside of mobilehome (Petition, Ex. B,  p. 9);  (4) 10(B)  (maintenance of home in a clean and sanitary condition)(Petition, Ex. B, p. 9);   (5) 10(C)(keeping  hazardous substances)(Petition, Ex. B, p. 10);  (6) 10(I)(proper  garbage and trash disposal)(Petition, Ex. B, p. 11); (7) 12(park  management’s right to enter homesite for maintenance)(Petition, Ex. B, p. 12);  (8) 14(G),  15(L) (parking of inoperative vehicle and only vehicles in neat and clean  appearance are allowed in park)(Petition, Ex. B, pp. 13-14);  (9) 16(A),  16(C), 16(G)(improper conduct, encroachment on other spaces and violation fo  local law or ordinance)(Petition, Ex. B, pp. 14-15).   The Court  notes Respondents did not file any response to the Petition.  On June 2, 2023, Petitioner filed proof of  personal service on Respondents, which indicated personal service at  Respondents’ mobile home on June 1, 2023.   .  The Petition,  therefore, is supported by clear and convincing evidence of Respondents’  violations of the Park’s reasonable Rules and Regulations.
