 Case Number:  21STLC06375    Hearing Date:   September 28, 2023    Dept:  25  Saucedo v. Carcamo, et al. 21STLC06375ANALYSIS:
 
I.               
Background
 
            Plaintiff
hired Defendants Erick Carcamo, Baily Shugart and All Black Form to produce
design plans for the development of two lots owned by Plaintiff.  Plaintiff alleges Defendants’ design plans
were completely unsuitable for the project, because they were incomplete and
did not conform to the requirements of hillside construction design plans or
blue prints necessary for development.  Defendants
ultimately withdrew from the project when Plaintiff demanded that they redo the
designs to conform to applicable requirements. 
Defendants have refused to return the money paid to them under their
agreement with Plaintiff.  Plaintiff
filed this action for consequential damages in the amount of $12,000 and a
refund of the initial contract fee of $4500. 

 
            Default was
entered against Defendants Carcamo and Shugart on 12-20-21.  Defendant All Black Form was dismissed on
5-4-23.  Default judgment was entered
against Defendants Carcamo and Shugart on 5-10-23 in the amount of $8,177.04.  
 
COMPLAINT FILED ON 9-1-21
1st c/a—breach of written contract
2nd c/a—conversion
3rd c/a—unfair business practices (B&PC
§17200)

Legal Standard 
 
            “The court may, upon any terms as
may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” CCP
§473(b). 
 
            CCP §473(b) is not a
“get-out-of-jail-free card for parties who later come to regret past inaction
or sitting on their rights.”  (McClain
v. Kissler (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 399, 414.) 
“It is the duty of every party desiring to resist an action or to
participate in a judicial proceeding to take timely and adequate steps to
retain counsel or to act in his own person to avoid an undesirable judgment.
Unless in arranging for his defense he shows that he has exercised such
reasonable diligence as a man of ordinary prudence usually bestows upon
important business his motion for relief under section 473 will be denied.
Courts neither act as guardians for incompetent parties nor for those who are
grossly careless of their own affairs.” 
(Id. at 415.)
 
            However, “when the party in default
moves promptly for relief, and the party opposing the motion will not suffer
prejudice is granted, very slight evidence is necessary to have default set
aside.”  (Shapell Socal Rental
Properties, LLC v. Chico’s FAS, Inc. (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 166, 218 (trial
court erred in denying tenant relief from default where plaintiff’s counsel
engaged in ethical breaches, complaint was served and default obtained in a
manner intended to keep defendant in the “dark about what was going on,”
absolutely no prejudice would have resulted from relief from default judgment
and trial court’s credibility determinations were not supported by the record.)  Only a weak showing is necessary and any
doubts must be resolved in favor o granting the defendant relief.  (Id.)

Discussion 
 
A. 
Motion is untimely 
 
Pursuant to CCP §473(b),
discretionary relief must be sought within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months after the judgment, dismissal, order or other proceeding
taken against a defendant. The six-month time limit for granting statutory relief
is jurisdictional and the court may not consider a motion for relief made after
that period has elapsed.  (Manson,
Iver & York v. Black (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 36, 42.)  “The general rule is that the six-month
period within which to bring a motion to vacate under section 473 runs from the
date of the default and not from the judgment taken thereafter. The reason for
the rule is that vacation of the judgment alone ordinarily would constitute an
idle act; if the judgment were vacated the default would remain intact and
permit immediate entry of another judgment giving the plaintiff the relief to
which his complaint entitles him.”  (Rutan
v. Summit Sports, Inc. (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 965, 970; see also Iver,
supra, 176 Cal.App.4th at 42.)
 
“[B]ecause it could not set aside
the default, it also could not set aside the default judgment under Code of
Civil Procedure section 473, because that would be an idle act. If the judgment
were vacated, it would be the duty of the court immediately to render another
judgment of like effect, and the defendants, still being in default, could not
be heard in opposition thereto.”  Pulte
Homes Corp. v. Williams Mechanical, Inc. (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 267, 273
(trial court properly denied relief from default and default judgment per
discretionary provision of CCP §473(b) where motion for relief was filed more
than six months after entry of default and less than six months after default
judgment).
 
The applicable deadline is measured
from the date of entry of default, not default judgment.  As discussed in Rutan and Pulte
Homes, the Court’s lack of jurisdiction to set aside default pursuant to
CCP §473(b) precludes the Court from considering a request to set aside the
default judgment, even if the motion was filed less than six months from entry
of the default judgment.  (Pulte Homes
Corp., supra, 2 Cal.App.5th at 273; Rutan, supra, 173
Cal.App.3d at 970.)
 
Defendants’ motion to vacate
default is untimely.  Default was entered
against Defendants on 12-20-21.  The
motion for relief was filed on 7-12-23, 18 months later.  The Court lacks jurisdiction to grant this
motion for relief pursuant to CCP §473(b), because it is untimely.  (Rutan, supra, 173 Cal.App.3d
at 970.) 
 
B. 
Defendants establish that they were never properly served with the
complaint and summons but do not seek relief under CCP §473(d)
 
Defendants Carcamo and Shugart move
for relief from default tand default judgment based on the discretionary relief
provision of CCP §437(b) based on mistake, inadvertence and excusable
neglect.  At all times, Defendants have
been self-represented.  However, “mere
self-representation is not a ground for exceptionally lenient treatment.”  (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8
Cal.4th 975, 984.)
 
According to Defendants they did
not respond to the complaint, because they did not believe that Plaintiff
properly served them.  Defendants argue
they were never personally served and substitute service was rendered at
Woodbury University.  Shugart was no
longer employeed at Woodbury University when substitute service was allegedly
rendered.  (Motion, Carcamo and Shugart
Dec., 4:20-23.)  Carcamo admits he was
employed by Woodbury at the time substitute service was rendered. (Id.
at 4:25-27-5:1-2.)  However, he was on
parental leave at the time service was rendered.  (Id. at 5:1-2.)
 
Defendants’ testimony regarding what
Ana Valencia said about accepting the complaint and summons is inadmissible.  Valencia is the person listed on the POS who
accepted the complaint and summons when service was rendered on Defendants at
Woodbury.  
 
A valid proof of service gives rise
to a rebuttable presumption of valid service. 
(Dill v. Berquist Const. Co., Inc. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th
1426, 1439, fn 12.)  Plaintiff’s POS
indicates substitute service on Defendants at their usual place of
business.  (Opposition, Exs. 1 and 2.) Carcamo
and Shugart submit sufficient evidence rebutting the presumption of proper
substitute service.  
 
Carcamo admits he was employed at
Woodbury at the time of service. However, given that Carcamo was on parental
leave, Woodbury was not his “usual place of business” at the time.  Substitute service can only be rendered at
defendant’s dwelling house (“usual place of abode”), usual place of business or
usual mailing address.  (CCP §415.20(b).)  
 
Shugart testifies that she was no
longer employed at Woodbury when service was rendered.  Woodbury was therefore not her usual place of
business under CCP §415.20(b).
 
Defendants were therefore never
properly served with the complaint and summons. 
The Court never acquired jurisdiction over them and Defendants were
never obligated to respond.  A defendant
is under no duty to respond in any way to a defectively served summons. It
makes no difference that defendant had actual knowledge of the action. Such
knowledge does not dispense with statutory requirements for service of summons.  (Kappel v. Bartlett (1988) 200
Cal.App.3d 1457, 1466; Slaughter v. Legal Process & Courier Service
(1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 1236, 1251 (requirement of notice "is not satisfied
by actual knowledge without notification conforming to the statutory
requirements”).)
 
Based on Defendants’ evidence, the
default and default judgment were therefore void ab initio.  Defendants did not, however, move for relief
from default and default judgment based on CCP §473(d), “void judgment or order,”
nor may the Court grant such relief sua sponte: 
“The court…may, on motion of either party after notice to the
other party, set aside any void judgment or order.”  (CCP §473(d).)  If Defendants choose to move for relief based
on CCP §473(d), such a motion is subject to a two-year deadline measured from
the date of entry of default judgment, despite the absence of an explicit
statutory deadline in CCP §473(d).  (Rogers
v. Silverman (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1114, 1121-1122 (process server served
wrong person); 8 Witkin, Cal. Proc. (6th ed. 2022), Attack, §216; Judges
Benchbook: Civil Proceedings—After Trial §§ 1.42, 3.11.)
 
V.

Carcamo and Shugart’s Motion to Set Aside Default and Default Judgment is
