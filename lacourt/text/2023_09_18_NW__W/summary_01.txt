English text:
The tentative ruling in the case 21VECV00329 concerns a motion by Defendant Steve Kott to compel responses to form interrogatories by Plaintiff NPI Debt Fund I, LP and request for sanctions of $1,200.00. The case is related to 21VECV00335 and 21VECV00333. The Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Property Cowboys, LLC entered into an agreement with Plaintiff to loan some monies and that Defendants Brard and Kott guaranteed the loan, which was defaulted on. The motion is granted, and the Defendant is awarded $600 in sanctions as the motion was unopposed. The Defendants failed to timely respond to the Plaintiff's properly served discovery request, and the court therefore grants the motion to deem requests admitted.
