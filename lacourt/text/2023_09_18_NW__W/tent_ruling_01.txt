[TENTATIVE]
RULING:
 
Defendant/Cross-Defendant Scott Kott’s Motion to Compel Responses to
Form Interrogatories to Form Interrogatories by Plaintiff NPI Debt Fund, I LP
and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant/Cross-Defendant Scott Kott moves
to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Kott’s form interrogatories, set two.
Defendant also requests an award of monetary sanctions in the amount of
$1,200.00 against Plaintiff to compensate Defendant for the cost of bringing
this motion.
 
Where a party fails to serve timely responses to
discovery requests, the court may make an order compelling responses. (CCP §§
2030.290, 2031.300, 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails
to serve a timely response to the discovery request waives any objection to the
request, including one based on privilege or the protection of attorney work
product. (CCP §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a); Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.) Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may also move for an
order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified
in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. (CCP §
2033.280(b).)
 
On May 9, 2023, Defendant caused Plaintiff to be served with form interrogatories,
set number two, via electronic service. (Meleski Decl. ¶4, Exh. 1.) The
responses were due June 12, 2023. (Meleski Decl. ¶5.) Defendant Kott agreed to
provide an extension of time to respond to June 23, 2023. (Meleski Decl. ¶5.)
Following meet and confer efforts, Plaintiff promised responses would be
received by July 28, 2023. (Meleski Decl. ¶5.) Again, Defendant Kott followed
up with Plaintiff for discovery responses. (Meleski Decl. ¶6.) Defendant has
not received any responses as of the date of the declaration. (Meleski Decl.
¶6.) 
 
The court finds Defendants
failed to timely respond to Jha’s properly served discovery request. The court
therefore grants Cross-Defendant’s motion to deem requests admitted GRANTED.
 
Sanctions
 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction … against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP § 2030.290(c).)            
 
Defendant requests $1,200.00 for 1.5 hours drafting the motion and 1.5
hours reviewing the opposition and preparing the reply at counsel’s hourly rate
of $400.00. The court grants Defendant’s request for sanctions in the reduced
amount of $600. The motion was unopposed.
