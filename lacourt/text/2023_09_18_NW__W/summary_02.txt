Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by Defendant Monika to the complaint filed by Plaintiffs Cyrus Mazaherian and Linda Terashita. The complaint alleges various causes of action, including breach of contract, unjust enrichment, money lent, money paid, constructive trust, judicial foreclosure, and declaratory relief.

The court sustains Defendant Monika's demurrer to the first, second, third, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth causes of action with leave to amend, finding that the complaint fails to state a claim for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, money lent, money paid, constructive trust, judicial foreclosure, and declaratory relief. The court overrules Defendant Monika's demurrer to the fourth cause of action, finding that the complaint states a claim for unjust enrichment.

The court's ruling is based on the following grounds:

* The complaint fails to state a claim for breach of contract because it does not allege the essential terms of the promissory note agreements.
* The complaint fails to state a claim for unjust enrichment because it does not allege that the defendants' acquisition of money was wrongful.
* The complaint fails to state a claim for money lent because it does not allege the amount borrowed and the monthly payments.
* The complaint fails to state a claim for money paid because it does not allege the amount paid and the purpose of the payment.
* The complaint fails to state a claim for constructive trust because it does not allege the wrongful act and the specific, identifiable property or property interest.
* The complaint fails to state a claim for judicial foreclosure because it does not allege that the court has jurisdiction over the real property.
* The complaint fails to state a claim for declaratory relief because it does not allege an actual controversy involving justiciable questions relating to the parties' rights or obligations.

English text:
In the case of MAZAHERIAN, et al. v. MAZAHERIAN, et al., the Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Monika Mazaherian's demurrer to the Plaintiff's complaint. The Judge sustained the demurrer to the First, Second, Third, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Causes of Action with leave to amend, except for the Fourth Cause of Action, which was overruled. The case involves Plaintiffs Cyrus Mazaherian and Linda Terashita filing a complaint against Defendants Cameron Mazaherian and Monika Mazaherian for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, money lent, money paid, constructive trust, judicial foreclosure, and declaratory relief. Plaintiffs allege they provided loans to Defendants under promissory note agreements, but Defendants have failed to make the monthly payments. Additionally, Plaintiffs believe Defendants' separation will cause an Event of Default under the promissory notes. The Judge found that Plaintiffs failed to allege sufficient facts to state a breach of contract claim against Defendant Monika Mazaherian, and the claim for unjust enrichment was not a valid cause of action. However, Plaintiffs may plead alternative theories at this time. The Judge also found that the common counts were subject to demurrer and the imposition of a constructive trust was not a substantive claim for relief. Additionally, the court lacked jurisdiction for the judicial foreclosure cause of action, and the ninth cause of action for declaratory relief was superfluous and subject to demurrer.
