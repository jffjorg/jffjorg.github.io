Here is a brief summary of the Judge's decision:

The Judge has denied the Motion to Quash Allstate's deposition subpoena to Wells Fargo, which seeks information related to the defendants' alleged fraudulent scheme involving false billing for medical services. The Judge found that the subpoena is relevant and not overbroad or burdensome, and that the defendants have failed to show any legitimate privacy interest in the information sought. The Judge also found that the defendants' failure to serve the California Department of Insurance as required and their failure to meet and confer with Allstate's counsel before filing the Motion to Quash were procedural deficiencies that weighed against the defendants' motion.
