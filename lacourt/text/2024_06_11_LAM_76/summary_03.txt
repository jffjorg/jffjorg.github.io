And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike portions of the Cross-Complaint filed by Cross-Defendant Renovaro Biosciences Inc. The motion is granted, striking paragraphs 5-15 of the Cross-Complaint, which are deemed irrelevant to the declaratory relief action. The court finds that declaratory relief is not available to address completed past wrongs, but rather serves to enable parties to shape their conduct to avoid future breaches. The court also denies Cross-Defendant's request to strike the late-filed opposition and orders Cross-Defendant to answer the remaining allegations of the Cross-Complaint within 10 days.
