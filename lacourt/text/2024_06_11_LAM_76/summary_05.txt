```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants defendant Claremont Graduate University's motion for leave to file a First Amended Answer to assert a new affirmative defense of lack of capacity based on plaintiff's testimony about having multiple personalities. The judge finds that defendant did not unreasonably delay in seeking leave to amend, and that the proposed amendment is proper. The judge notes that generally, the validity of the proposed amendment is not considered in determining whether leave to amend is proper, but rather a demurrer or other law and motion is the appropriate means of testing the legal sufficiency of the claim. The judge orders defendant to file a stand-alone copy of the First Amended Answer today, which is deemed served as of the date of this order.
