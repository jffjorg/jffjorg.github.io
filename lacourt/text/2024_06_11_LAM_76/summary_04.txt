And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively ruled that Attorney Friedman & Chapman, LLP, the counsel for Plaintiffs Ebony Martin and Gregory McKeown, will be relieved as counsel. The motion to be relieved as counsel was granted, and the order will become effective once the signed order is filed with proof of service to the clients. The court's decision was based on the failure of the clients to respond to communication efforts by counsel and the submission of all mandatory Judicial Council forms. The clients have been given time to locate new counsel or represent themselves in pro per if they wish.
