Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a Tentative Ruling on a motion by American Modern Home Insurance Group, Inc. to contest the good faith of a settlement between Robert Meepos, as former Trustee of the Kent Sherwood 2011 Trust, and Vicki Laken. The Judge has denied the motion as untimely and also denied it on its merits. The settlement was made between Meepos and Laken over the insurance proceeds for dwelling repairs to a mobile home destroyed by the Woolsey Fire in 2018. American Modern claims that the settlement should be voided because it will impact its potential judgment against it in the lawsuit filed by Laken. However, the Judge ruled that the settlement is valid and American Modern has not shown otherwise.
