BACKGROUND
This
is a personal injury action. On October 9, 2023, plaintiffs Laura Bernal
Villegas, Dieter Soza, and Dodi Soza (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed this
action against Defendants Pauline Esparza, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance
Company, and Does 1 to 10, alleging causes of action for general negligence and
breach of contract. 
On November
2, 2023, Kelly Ryan, and Jillian Reyes of The Ryan Law Firm, APLC, counsel for Plaintiffs,
filed the instant motion to be relieved as counsel. The motion is unopposed. 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 The Court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted, provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.) 
A motion
to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council Form MC-051 (Notice
of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the client and on all
parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362,
subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION
Kelly Ryan
and Jillian Reyes of The Ryan Law Firm, APLC (Counsel) seek to be relieved as
counsel for Plaintiffs. Counsel contends significant irreconcilable differences
have arisen between Counsel and Plaintiffs and that there has been a breakdown
in the attorney-client relationship. (Reyes Decl., ¶ 2.) Counsel further
indicates that Plaintiffs have stated they do not want Counsel to continue to
represent them in this matter, but that they have refused to execute
substitution of counsel forms. (Id.) The Court finds this to be proper
grounds for withdrawal. 
Grounds
for permitting an attorney to withdraw from representation include the client’s
conduct that “renders it unreasonably difficult for the lawyer to carry out the
representation effectively[.]” (Cal. Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1.16,
subd. (b)(4).) A breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is also grounds
for allowing the attorney to withdraw. (Estate of Falco (1987) 188
Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.) 
Counsel
has provided the appropriate Judicial Council forms, namely forms MC-051,
MC-052, and MC-053, and has properly completed them. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) Each of these documents also contains a proof of
service attached thereto indicating that Counsel has served these documents on
Plaintiffs at their current address. 
CONCLUSION
The
Motion to be Relieved as Plaintiffs’ Counsel is GRANTED. 
Counsel
is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file proof of service of same
within five calendar days of this order. The Court will sign the Proposed Order
(Form MC-053). The Court further orders Counsel to serve the signed Order (Form
MC-053) upon Plaintiff and file proof of service of same within five calendar
days thereof.
