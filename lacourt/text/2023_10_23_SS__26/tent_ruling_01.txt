ANALYSIS:
 
On August 3, 2021, Plaintiff
Katherina Pellegrin, in properia persona, (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action for breach of lease agreement and related claims against Defendants Georgina
Capital, Inc. and Todd M. Smith (“Defendants”). Following Defendants’ failure
to file a responsive pleading, default judgment was entered in Plaintiff’s favor
on May 20, 2022. (Default Judgment 05/20/22.) The request for default judgment
was supported by Plaintiff’s declaration indicating that she was in properia
persona, but also by the declaration of attorney Stewart Richlin of Gomez Law,
APC indicating that he provided legal services to Plaintiff and requesting
attorney’s fees. (Pellegrin Decl., filed 05/04/22, p. 1; Richlin Decl., filed
05/04/22, ¶¶8-10.) The Court awarded Plaintiff attorney’s fees with the
judgment in the amount of $1,006.74. (Default Judgment, 05/20/22, p. 2:14-15.) 
 
On November 21, 2022, Plaintiff
filed a substitution of attorney form indicating that she formerly represented
herself and now was being represented by Attorney Mark Gomez, Esq. of Gomez
Law, APC. (Substitution of Attorney, filed 11/21/22, ¶¶1-2.) Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to Amend Judgment on August 28, 2023. To date, no opposition
has been filed. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend
Judgment seeks to add an award of post-judgment attorney’s fees to the
judgment, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 685.070 and 685.080. “The judgment creditor may claim
under this section the following costs of enforcing a judgment: . . . (6)
Attorney's fees, if allowed by Section 685.040.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 685.070, subd. (a).) Code of Civil Procedure, section 685.040 states: “The judgment
creditor is entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a judgment.
Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are not included in costs
collectible under this title unless otherwise provided by law. Attorney’s
fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are included as costs collectible under
this title if the underlying judgment includes an award of attorney’s fees to
the judgment creditor pursuant to
subparagraph (A) of paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) of Section 1033.5.” Also,
the motion must be brought within two years of the incurred costs. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 685.080, subd. (a).) 
 
It appears that the Court’s earlier award of attorney’s fees
with the default judgment was improper. At the time default judgment was
sought, Plaintiff admits she was in pro per and that Plaintiff’s counsel was
not retained until October 2022. (Motion, Gomez Decl., ¶7.) This admission
raises serious questions about the declaration of Attorney Stewart Richlin,
Esq. of Gomez Law, APC filed in support of the default judgment on May 4, 2022.
It is black letter law that a pro per litigant cannot recover attorney’s fees.
(Trope v. Katz (1995) 11 Cal.4th 274, 292.) Therefore, at the time of
the default judgment, Plaintiff should not have been awarded attorney’s fees. 
 
To the extent that Plaintiff relies on the award of
attorney’s fees in the default judgment to provide a basis for an award of
post-judgment attorney’s fees, the Court finds there is no legal basis for an
award of post-judgment attorney’s fees.  
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff
Katherina Pellegrin’s Motion to Amend Judgment is DENIED.
