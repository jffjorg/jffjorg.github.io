```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion of non-party Rony Zarco to quash or recall the writ of execution. Zarco claims that money owed for the judgment against Defendant Arcos was taken from his Chase bank account, and that he was notified by the United States Postal Service (USPS) to pick up an unknown certified letter. He also claims that he did not authorize the use of his social security number by anyone. However, the Court finds that Zarco has not demonstrated that his assets have been attached pursuant to the subject writ of execution, nor that the writ is facially void. The Court therefore denies the motion to quash the writ of execution.
