And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a request for a preliminary injunction to prevent Upper Deck Company from distributing physical copies of Marvel trading cards that were stolen from Pivot Collectibles LLC. The plaintiff, Pivot Collectibles LLC, alleges that its former employee, Akika Rosenbluth, stole approximately $750,000 worth of Marvel trading cards and sold them to third parties using Pivot's e-Pack account. The plaintiff seeks to enjoin Upper Deck Company from distributing the physical copies of the stolen cards.

The judge notes that the plaintiff has failed to show any likelihood of success on the merits of its declaratory relief claim against Upper Deck Company. The court also finds that the plaintiff has failed to establish that a preliminary injunction is necessary to prevent irreparable harm. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's alleged loss can be compensated for in monetary damages, and therefore, the preliminary injunction is denied.

The judge also notes that the plaintiff's argument that the cards are "extremely unique and extremely limited in production," and "irreplaceable," is not persuasive. The plaintiff's manager, Avi Oscherowitz, describes the stolen trading cards as "irreplaceable," but the judge finds that this argument is not sufficient to establish irreparable harm.

Finally, the judge concludes that the plaintiff has failed to establish that Upper Deck Company has a duty to return the stolen property or that a preliminary injunction is necessary to prevent the dissemination of the stolen cards. The judge notes that the plaintiff's harms can be addressed by a money damages award against the perpetrator of the theft, Rosenbluth, and that the relative balancing favors Upper Deck Company, which is being asked to be prevented from disseminating the physical cards in its possession corresponding to those owned by Pivot Collectibles LLC.
