And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying without prejudice the motions to be relieved as counsel for defendants Eva M. Gabor and Mallorie Mehrali. The motions were filed by Trust Law Partners, LLP, and were unopposed. However, the proposed orders required by California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362 were not lodged with the court or served on the clients and other parties. The judge finds that the proposed orders are necessary to provide important warnings and information to the clients, and that filling out and serving the proper order is mandatory. The judge is continuing to encourage audio or video appearances and reminding parties to make arrangements in advance if they wish to appear remotely.
