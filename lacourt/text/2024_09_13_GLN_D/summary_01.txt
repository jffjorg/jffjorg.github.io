And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is as follows:

* The court will consider the untimely opposition to the demurrer, but defendant is cautioned that in the future, the court may refuse to consider pleadings not filed in conformity with the statutes, rules, and procedures governing this litigation.
* The demurrer on the ground that the court lacks jurisdiction over the "subject of the cause of action" is overruled.
* The demurrer on the ground that defendant has not been properly served with the amended complaint is also overruled.
* The demurrer on the ground that the complaint fails to state a cause of action against defendant Sean Cox is sustained with leave to amend.
* The court sustains the demurrer to the first, second, and third causes of action (breach of fiduciary duty, conspiracy, and conversion) on the ground that these causes of action appear to be intended to be directed to Doe defendants but include no charging allegations against the Does or against moving defendant Sean Cox.
* The court overrules the demurrer to the fourth cause of action (negligence) as this cause of action is not expressly alleged against Doe defendants, and moving defendant Sean Cox lacks standing to challenge its sufficiency.
* The parties are ordered to meet and confer in full compliance with CCP § 430.41 before any further demurrer may be filed.
* The court is continuing to conduct and encourage audio or video appearances and requests that parties make arrangements in advance if they wish to appear remotely.
