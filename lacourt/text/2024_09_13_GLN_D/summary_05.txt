And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to document demands in a case involving a plaintiff who leased a 2022 Maserati MC20 from the defendant. The plaintiff alleges that the vehicle was delivered with defects and that the defendant failed to repair the vehicle. The defendant has not complied with the plaintiff's document demands, and the plaintiff is seeking further responses.

The judge has denied the motion without prejudice, citing the Standing Order Re Discovery (Song-Beverly Litigation) and the Notice to All Counsel Re: Lemon Law Cases for Department D. The parties are ordered to meet and confer in good faith concerning compliance with the order and to serve any further discovery. The judge has also reminded the parties that any further objections to documents must be code-compliant and accompanied by a code-compliant privilege log.

The judge has also noted that the parties have not yet entered into a protective order, and that if either party requires a protective order, the procedures are addressed in the order. The court will expect code-compliant responses to document demands, and any unnecessary objections will be overruled.
