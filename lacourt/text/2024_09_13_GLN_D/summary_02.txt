And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by plaintiff Raffi Tarakjian to compel defendant George Assali to produce documents in response to a deposition notice. The motion is granted in part. Defendant is ordered to produce documents responsive to certain requests, including communications with plaintiff, writings related to real estate purchases, and profits paid back to plaintiff. The motion is denied with respect to documents related to defendant's wealth, as they were not described in the deposition notice.

The judge also awards monetary sanctions to plaintiff in the amount of $2,761.15, which represents the reasonable cost of attorney's fees and costs incurred by plaintiff in connection with the motion.

The judge notes that defendant's failure to produce responsive documents and his refusal to comply with discovery obligations have caused inconvenience and delay to the case. The judge cautions defendant's counsel that failure to comply with court rules and deadlines may result in papers being refused or considered untimely in the future.

The judge orders that defendant produce all responsive documents within 30 days and that the documents include all electronically stored information available concerning the dates of creation of the writings and communications requested.
