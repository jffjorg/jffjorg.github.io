And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to seal the trial binder. The plaintiff, The Wonderful Company, and the defendants, Anthem Blue Cross Life and Health Insurance Co. et al., jointly move to seal the trial binder. However, the judge finds that since the court maintains physical control of the trial binder and does not make it available to the public, there is no need to seal the binder. The parties may move to seal individual documents within the trial binder in independently noticed motions. Therefore, the judge denies the motion to seal the trial binder.
