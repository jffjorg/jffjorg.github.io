And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to strike filed by the defendants, Litta E. Lee and Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage Company. The motion seeks to strike references to attorney's fees and emotional damages from the plaintiffs' complaint.

The Court grants the motion to strike references to emotional damages, as the plaintiffs do not have a basis for seeking emotional damages in this case. The Court also grants the motion to strike references to attorney's fees under the doctrine of Tort of Another, as the doctrine does not apply where multiple codefendants are involved and the plaintiff has been damaged by their joint negligence.

However, the Court does not strike references to attorney's fees that may be recoverable from parties due to the Purchasing Agreement. The Court's final ruling will be issued on January 6, 2025.
