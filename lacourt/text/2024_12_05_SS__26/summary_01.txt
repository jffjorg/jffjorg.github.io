And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel defendant's responses to form interrogatories, as well as their request for sanctions. The plaintiff had filed the motion after the defendant failed to respond to discovery requests. However, the judge found that the plaintiff's form interrogatories were in violation of the Code of Civil Procedure, as they contained subparts which are prohibited in limited jurisdiction courts. As a result, the judge declines to compel the defendant's responses to these discovery requests.
