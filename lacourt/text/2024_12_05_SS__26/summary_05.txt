And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for sanctions filed by defendants Lee Ann DiSalvo and Intuitive Healing Institute, LLC against plaintiff Sushant Gupta in the amount of $23,816.00. The motion was brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, which allows the court to order a party to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by another party as a result of actions or tactics made in bad faith that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay. The court found that plaintiff's filing of the complaint and conduct during the litigation were in bad faith and frivolous, and that defendants acted with diligence in bringing the motion for sanctions. The court also found that plaintiff's motivation for filing the action and conducting the litigation was to harass and extort money from defendants. As a result, the court ordered defendants to pay $23,816.00 in sanctions, which includes $23,000.00 in attorney's fees and $816.00 in filing fees.
