And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling regarding the petition to confirm an arbitration award filed by Teamsters Local Union 572 against Ralphs Grocery Co. The petition seeks enforcement of an arbitration order requiring Ralphs to make whole employees who were laid off or lost wages and benefits due to the company's transfer of certain work. The petition does not seek a specific monetary amount. The parties have engaged in settlement discussions, which have resulted in a tentative agreement, but the terms need to be reduced to writing. The judge will wait until the hearing to make a final decision. If a settlement is reached, the parties must file a notice of settlement. If no settlement is reached, the court will set an order to show cause, which will require Ralphs to explain why the action should not be transferred to an unlimited jurisdiction court.
