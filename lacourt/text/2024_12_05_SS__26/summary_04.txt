And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling dismissing Petitioner Qiang Fang's Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award. The Petition was filed on July 30, 2024, and no response has been filed by Respondent Thomas T. Chen. The judge finds that the Petitioner failed to meet the statutory requirements for service of the petition and notice of hearing, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4. Specifically, the proof of service filed did not conform to any manner of service permitted for service of a summons. The judge also finds that the Petitioner did not timely serve the petition, as required by Code of Civil Procedure sections 1288 and 1288.4. Therefore, the Petition is dismissed. The judge notes that the Petitioner is in pro per and therefore is not entitled to attorney's fees.
