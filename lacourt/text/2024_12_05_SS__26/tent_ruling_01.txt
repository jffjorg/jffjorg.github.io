  Case Number:  23STLC01716    Hearing Date:   December 5, 2024    Dept:  26 X-Tream Cleaning Service Inc. v. Royal Personal Training et al.,TENTATIVE RULING:
          
Plaintiff X-Tream Cleaning Service, Inc.’s Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories, and Request for Sanctions, is DENIED.
ANALYSIS:
On March 14, 2023, Plaintiff X-Tream Cleaning Service, Inc.
filed the instant action for breach of contract against Defendant Royal
Personal Training (“Defendant”). On February 21, 2024, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and
Request for Sanctions. (Minute Order, 02/21/24.) Plaintiff filed a Motion to Compel
Discovery Responses and Request for Sanctions, which came on for hearing on
October 22, 2024. The Court noted a number of defects with the Motion to
Compel, including improperly filing a single discovery motion to compel
responses with respect to four separate sets of discovery and failing to attach
copies of the discovery requests served on Defendant. (Minute Order, 10/22/24.)
Plaintiff filed a supplemental declaration on October 22,
2024 and additional notices of motion demonstrating that these defects have
been corrected.
Discussion
Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant’s initial responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set Two, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290.
(Notice of Motion, filed 10/29/24, p. 1:24-26.)
However, the form interrogatories propounded by Plaintiff
are in violation of Code of Civil Procedure section 94, subdivision (a), which prohibits
interrogatories with subparts in the limited jurisdiction court. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 94, subd. (a)(1).) The form interrogatories propounded on Defendant
contain subparts. (Motion, Supp. Hurt Decl., Exh. A, Form Interrogatories Nos.
17.0 and 50.0.) The Court declines to compel responses to discovery propounded
in violation of the Code of Civil Procedure.
Conclusion 
Plaintiff X-Tream Cleaning Service, Inc.’s Motion to Compel
Responses to Form Interrogatories, and Request for Sanctions, is DENIED.
Court clerk to give notice.
