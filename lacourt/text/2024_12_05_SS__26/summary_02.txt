The Judge has denied the Plaintiffs' Motion to Reclassify the action to a limited jurisdiction court. However, the Judge has set an Order to Show Cause regarding why the action should not be reclassified to an unlimited jurisdiction court, citing the need to determine the parties' rights and the placement of a headstone ordered for the Plaintiffs' mother. The Order to Show Cause is set for February 5, 2025, at 9:30 AM in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
