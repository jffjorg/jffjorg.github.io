ANALYSIS: 
On December 19, 2023, Plaintiffs Rita Cuadros, Nancy
Cuadros, and Veronica O’Hacer (“Plaintiffs”) filed the instant action for breach
of contract, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief against Defendants Martha
Tonkins (erroneously sued as Martha Tompkins), Kimberly Stoll (erroneously sued
as Defendant Kimberly Cuadros) (“Defendant Stoll”), Miguel Cuadros (“Defendant
Cuadros”), SCI California Funeral Services, Inc. dba Oakdale Memorial Park
(erroneously sued as Oakdale Cemetery) (“Defendant SCI”) and Dignity Memorial (“Defendant
Dignity”). Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint adding causes of action
for fraud and negligent infliction of emotional distress on April 25, 2024.
Defendants Stoll, Cuadros, Tonkins and SCI filed responses to the action in
June 2024. 
Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion to Reclassify this
Action on October 3, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.
Discussion
The Motion is not accompanied by a proof of service showing service
of the moving papers or of the notice of the motion and hearing date on Defendants.
Failure to give notice of a motion is not only a violation of the statutory
requirements but of due process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero
(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.) Accordingly, the Motion to Reclassify this
Action is denied. 
However, in light of the declaratory and injunctive relief
sought in the Complaint and First Amended Complaint with respect to the
parties’ rights and the placement of the headstone ordered for Plaintiffs’
mother, the Court finds this action should be reclassified to an unlimited
jurisdiction court. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 85, 86.) 
An order to show cause regarding why this action should not
be reclassified to an unlimited jurisdiction court is set. Each Defendant may
file and serve a response to the order to show cause, not to exceed five pages,
at least ten (10) court days prior to the date of the order to show cause.  
Conclusion
Plaintiffs Rita Cuadros, Nancy Cuadros, and Veronica O’Hacer’s
Motion to Reclassify is DENIED.
AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE REGARDING WHY THIS ACTION SHOULD NOT
BE RECLASSIFIED TO THE UNLIMITED JURISDICTION COURT IS SET FOR FEBRUARY 5, 2025
AT 9:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.
