And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel arbitration and has set an order to show cause regarding the failure to enter default and default judgment for March 6, 2025. The plaintiff, Anselmo Lorenzo Maradiaga and Sandra Osorto, filed a lawsuit against defendants Ignacio Macias, Bayside Credit, and Hudson Insurance Company, seeking to compel arbitration based on a vehicle retail installment sale contract (RISC). However, the defendants, Macias and Bayside, have failed to file a responsive pleading, and the plaintiff is now required to enter their default. The judge has determined that the plaintiff has improperly sought to both proceed in court and compel arbitration, contrary to the express language of the statute.
