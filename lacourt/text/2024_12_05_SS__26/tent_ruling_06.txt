ANALYSIS:
On August 14, 2024, Plaintiffs Lorenzo Maradiaga and Sandra
Osorto (“Plaintiffs”) filed this action against Defendants Ignacio Macias dba
Imperial Motor Sports (Defendant Macias”), Bayside Credit (“Defendant Bayside”), and Hudson Insurance Company (“Defendant
Hudson Insurance”). Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel Arbitration on
September 11, 2024.
On October 11, 2024,
Defendant Hudson Insurance filed an answer to the Complaint and a
cross-complaint against Plaintiff. Proof of service of the Summons and
Complaint were filed with respect to all Defendants on October 14, 2024. To
date, Defendants Macias and Bayside have not filed responses to the action.
Discussion
Plaintiff brings the instant Motion seeking to compel Defendants Marcias and Bayside to submit to arbitration based on a vehicle
Retail Installment Sale Contract (the “RISC”), pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure sections 1281.2, 1281.97, and 1281.99. (Notice of Motion, pp.
1:25-2:13.)
However, due to Defendants
Macias and Bayside having been served with the Summons and Complaint and
failing to file a responsive pleading, Plaintiff is now required to enter their default. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.110(g) [“If a responsive pleading is not served within the time limits
specified in this rule and no extension of time has been granted, the plaintiff
must file a request for entry of default within 10 days after the time for
service has elapsed.”].) Plaintiff has not shown that the Court has jurisdiction to do anything other than enter default as to Defendants
Macias and Bayside.
In fact, Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.97, on which Plaintiff
relies, provides that if the drafting party of the arbitration agreement is in
material breach by failing to pay certain fees and costs before the arbitration
can proceed, the “consumer may do either of the following:
 (1) Withdraw the claim from arbitration and proceed in a court of
appropriate jurisdiction.
(2) Compel arbitration in which the drafting party shall pay reasonable
attorney's fees and costs related to the arbitration.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2, subds. (a), (b) [emphasis added].)
Here, Plaintiff has improperly sought to both proceed in court and compel
arbitration, contrary to the express language of the statute. Plaintiff filed
this action bringing five separate causes of action against Defendants, while
also seeking to compel Defendants Macias and Bayside to arbitration. This is
not permitted under the authority on which Plaintiff relies.
