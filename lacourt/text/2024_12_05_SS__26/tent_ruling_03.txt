ANALYSIS: 
On June 6, 2024, Petitioner Teamsters Local Union 572 (“Petitioner”) filed the instant
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award (the “Petition”) against Respondent
Ralphs Grocery Company (“Respondent”). The Petition seeks enforcement of an
arbitration order requiring Respondent “to make whole those employees who were
laid off or lost wages and benefits when Respondent transferred the work of
producing paychecks, printing identification tags, and processing Vestcom price
tags and materials.” (Pet., Attachment (4)(b), p. 16.) The Petition does not
seek entry of judgment based on a monetary amount. (See id. at ¶8b.) 
The Petition was set for hearing on October 24, 2024 but
continued pursuant to the parties’ stipulation to engage in settlement
discussions. (Joint Stipulation, filed 10/17/24, ¶¶3-4.) On November 19, 2024,
the parties filed a joint stipulation indicating that a settlement has been
reached but that more time was needed to reduce the terms to writing. (Joint
Stipulation, filed 11/19/24, ¶¶4-5.) No additional papers have been filed to
date.
Discussion 
The ruling will depend on what information the parties
provide at the hearing. If a settlement is in place, the parties are to file a
notice of settlement. If no settlement exists, the Court will set an Order to
Show Cause regarding why this action should not be transferred to an unlimited
jurisdiction court for January 16, 2025, at 9:30 am in Department 26 in the
Spring Street Courthouse. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 85, 86.) The parties may
file and serve a response to the Order to Show Cause by January 2, 2025. 
Conclusion 
Ruling on Petitioner Teamsters Local Union 572’s Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award will
depend on what happens at the hearing.
