And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the Judge regarding a petition to change a name. The Judge orders the petitioner to review the proposed decree for spelling and legibility of the new name. If the petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility, no appearance is necessary and the petition will be granted. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
