The judge has granted the petition and has ruled that the proposed decree will be signed. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the name is satisfactory, the petitioner is not required to appear at the hearing. However, if the name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A copy of the signed decree will be available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date. Additionally, the judge has noted that once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
