And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the petition for name change, but has made it conditional on the petitioner reviewing and correcting the spelling and legibility of the new name on the proposed decree. If the petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility, they do not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the name is not clear and correct, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The signed decree will be available for pick-up at the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing, and once signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
