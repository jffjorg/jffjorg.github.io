  Case Number:  24STCP00940    Hearing Date:   September 30, 2024    Dept:  9 The Name Change Clerk’s notations are vague
and ambiguous. The criminal history assessment that the Name Change Clerk ran
on September 17, 2024, states in part that Petitioner is unable to be
identified and to see the attached live scan results. The attached live scan
results appear to suggest that Petitioner is not a registered sex offender, which
would contradict the Clerk’s office’s notation that petitioner is unable to be
identified. It is unclear whether this notation means that despite the attached
live scan results, more information is needed, or instead whether sufficient
information has been provided. 
 
On the Court's own motion, the Order
to Show Cause Re: Name Change scheduled for 09/30/2024 is continued to 10/21/2024
at 09:30 AM in Department 9 at Spring Street Courthouse. 
 
The Name Change Clerk is ordered to
run and complete a criminal history assessment prior to the continued hearing.  The Clerk’s Office must re-run the criminal
history assessment and provide clearer notation whether Petitioner has any
convictions, including for offenses that require sex offender registration.
