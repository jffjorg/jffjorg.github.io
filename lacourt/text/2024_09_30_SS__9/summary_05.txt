The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a name change petition. The petition was submitted by the Petitioner, who has proposed a new name. The judge is requiring the Petitioner to review and correct the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the Petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility of the new name, they do not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The judge has granted the petition, and a signed copy of the decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
