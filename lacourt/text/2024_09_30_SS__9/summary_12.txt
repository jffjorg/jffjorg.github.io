And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a petition to change name. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the petitioner is satisfied with the spelling and legibility, they do not need to appear at the hearing. However, if the new name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The petition is granted, and a copy of the signed decree will be available at the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Additionally, the judge notes that once the proposed decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
