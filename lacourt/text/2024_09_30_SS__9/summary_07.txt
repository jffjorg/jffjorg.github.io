And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in the case of Petitioner, granting the petition to change their name. The judge requires the Petitioner to review the proposed decree for spelling and legibility. If the name is correctly spelled and legible, no appearance is necessary. However, if the name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
