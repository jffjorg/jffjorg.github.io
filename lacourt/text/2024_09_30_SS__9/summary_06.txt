And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition and has decided to grant it. The petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the petitioner is satisfied with the decree, no appearance is necessary at the hearing on September 30, 2024. However, if the name is not clearly written and correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition. A copy of the signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing date.
