And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is continuing the petition for a name change due to the ambiguity of the Name Change Clerk's notation regarding Petitioner's criminal history. The Clerk's Office initially unable to identify Petitioner and had noted that they were unable to see the attached live scan results, which indicated that Petitioner is not a registered sex offender. The judge ordered the Clerk's Office to re-run the criminal history assessment and provide clearer notations, but the Clerk's Office failed to comply with this order. As a result, the petition is continued to October 21, 2024, and the Clerk's Office must re-run the assessment before the next hearing.
