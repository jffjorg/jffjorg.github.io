And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the Petitioner, granting their petition to change their name. Before the hearing on September 30, 2024, the Petitioner must review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the name is satisfactory, no appearance is necessary. However, if the name is not clearly written or correctly spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. After the hearing, a signed copy of the decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days later. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
