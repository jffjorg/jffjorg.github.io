And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is ruling on a petition to change a name. The judge is instructing the petitioner to review the proposed decree to ensure that the new name is correctly spelled and legible. If the name is not clear or correctly spelled, the petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. If the name is correct, no appearance is necessary. The judge is granting the petition and will make the signed decree available in the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing. Once the decree is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition.
