And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a name change case, ordering a continuation of the hearing from September 30, 2024 to October 21, 2024. The Judge is concerned about the unclear and ambiguous notation from the Name Change Clerk's office, which states that the Petitioner is unable to be identified, but the attached live scan results suggest otherwise. The Judge orders the Name Change Clerk to re-run the criminal history assessment and provide clearer notation about the Petitioner's criminal history, including any convictions that may require sex offender registration. The Clerk's office is also ordered to provide the Petitioner with notice of the continued hearing.
