In addition, the Criminal History
assessment reflects an active protective order restraining Petitioner. Petitioner
is ordered to file a declaration no later than November 4, 2024 explaining (1)
the circumstances of the issuance of the protective order against Petitioner
and (2) why the Court should not require Petitioner to alert the Court that
issued the protective order of Petitioner’s request for name change so that the

in person or remotely via LACourtConnect) at the continued OSC hearing to
answer any further questions the Court may have after reviewing Petitioner’s
declaration.
