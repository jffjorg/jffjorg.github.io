 Case Number:  24STCP01344    Hearing Date:   September 30, 2024    Dept:  9 As the Court previously noted on  September 23, 2024, the criminal history assessment that the Clerk’s Office ran  on September 5, 2024, states in part that the Clerk is unable to identify Petitioner  and to see the attached live scan results. The attached live scan results seem  to indicate that Petitioner is not a registered sex offender, but the Clerk’s  office’s notation indicates that petitioner is unable to be identified. This Name  Change Clerk’s notation is vague and ambiguous. It is unclear whether this  notation means that despite the attached live scan results that more  information is needed, or instead that sufficient information has been  provided.   The Court ordered the Name Change  Clerk to re-run the criminal history assessment and provide clearer notations  as to whether Petitioner has any convictions, including for offenses that  require sex offender registration.  The  Name Change Clerk has failed to do so before the continued hearing date of  September 30, 2024.   Accordingly, the instant petition is  continued to October 21, 2024 at 9:30 am.  Prior to  the continued (October 21, 2024) hearing, the Name Change Clerk must comply  with the Court’s order to re-run Petitioner’s criminal history assessment.   Court Clerk to give notice.
