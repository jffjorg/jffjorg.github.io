The Judge's tentative ruling grants the petition and sets out the next steps for the Petitioner. The Petitioner must review the new name on the proposed decree and ensure it is clearly written and correctly spelled. If the name is correct, no appearance is necessary at the hearing. However, if the name is not correctly written or spelled, the Petitioner must appear at the hearing to submit a corrected proposed decree. The signed decree will be available in Room 112 of the Clerk's Office seven days after the hearing, and once it is signed, it cannot be amended without a new petition to change name.
