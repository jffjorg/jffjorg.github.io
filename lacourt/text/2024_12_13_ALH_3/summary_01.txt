```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court is considering the Plaintiffs' motion for summary adjudication of Defendant's Seventh and Eighth Affirmative Defenses. The Defendant's dispute resolution process has not been certified by the California Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA), despite being required to do so under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and Business and Professions Code section 472. The Court finds that Defendant's dispute resolution process does not meet the requirements for certification and that Defendant did not maintain a qualified third-party dispute resolution process. Therefore, the Court grants the Plaintiffs' motion for summary adjudication and finds that Defendant's Seventh and Eighth Affirmative Defenses fail as a matter of law.
