And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling is on a motion to compel further discovery responses filed by Plaintiffs Andrew Stewart and Shyla Stewart against Defendants William Cleary and Cindy Cleary. The motion is denied due to numerous failures by Plaintiffs to comply with California Rules of Court and the Code of Civil Procedure. Specifically, Plaintiffs' moving papers did not comply with the rules, and they failed to give adequate notice of their motion and failed to meet and confer before filing their motion. The Court also notes that Plaintiffs' request for compensation is denied as they do not prevail on this motion. The Court will adopt the tentative ruling as the final order unless the parties indicate otherwise.
