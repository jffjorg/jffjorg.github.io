Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for issuance of letters rogatory filed by the defendants, Wilshire Quinn Income Fund REIT, LLC and Wilshire Quinn Income Fund, LLC. The defendants seek to depose April Ferguson, a Canadian resident, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to obtain evidence about the person responsible for the underlying forgeries of which the plaintiff complains. The plaintiff alleges that a grant deed was forged conveying the plaintiff's properties, which were then encumbered without the plaintiff's authorization. The defendants believe that April Ferguson provided fake, forged, and falsified documents during the loan application process, including the loan application, signed leases, and a fake tax return. The judge finds that issuance of letters rogatory is necessary to obtain evidence about the person responsible for the underlying forgeries and grants the motion in accordance with the laws of Canada.
