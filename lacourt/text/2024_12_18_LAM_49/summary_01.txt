Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to quash a subpoena issued to Pacifica Trucks, LLC, seeking employment records from a prior job. The plaintiff, Jennie Villa, alleges that she was discriminated against and terminated from her job at Lotte Global Logistics (North America), Inc. due to her ethnicity and/or gender. The defendant argues that the subpoena is necessary to defend against the plaintiff's claims. The judge ruled that the subpoena is relevant to the case and is not overbroad, and that the plaintiff has reduced her expectation of privacy by bringing the lawsuit. The judge also declined to award expenses to either party, as the motion was not made or opposed in bad faith.
