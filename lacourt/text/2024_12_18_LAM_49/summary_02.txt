And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant breached a written agreement by not paying for work done on the defendant's house, and sought $96,000 in damages. On January 29, 2024, the court sustained the defendant's demurrer to the complaint, giving the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint. However, the plaintiff did not file an amended complaint within the time allowed, and the defendant has now moved to dismiss the action. The judge has found that the plaintiff's failure to amend the complaint within the time allowed warrants dismissal of the action, and has ordered the action to be dismissed with prejudice. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the dismissal.
