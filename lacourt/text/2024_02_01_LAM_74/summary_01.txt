Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the motions, opposition, and reply in this case. The plaintiff, Ernest J. Franceschi Jr., filed a complaint against the defendant, Christopher Baldwin, and others. The defendant moved for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiff's civil extortion claim fails because the plaintiff never paid the money demanded. The court agrees with the defendant and grants the motion for summary judgment. The court finds that the plaintiff's civil extortion claim fails because the plaintiff never paid the money demanded, and the defendant's prima facie burden has been met. The court also finds that the plaintiff's alleged emotional distress and loss of income are not cognizable damages. The court orders that the defendant file and serve a proposed judgment of dismissal, and the defendant shall give notice.
