Background[1]  
Case
No. KC068691 (i.e., “Claremont I”)
Plaintiff Southern California School
of Theology dba Claremont School of Theology (“CST”) alleges as follows:
On June 5, 1957, Defendant
Claremont Graduate University fka Claremont College and Claremont University
Center (“CGU”) conveyed approximately 16.4 acres of land contiguous to The
Claremont Colleges (“Parcels 1 and 2”) to CST in exchange for $107,500.00 via a
grant deed (the “1957 Deed”). The 1957 Deed contained two restrictions: (1) a First
Option Clause (“FOC”) and (2) an educational use restriction, both of which
were enforced by a power of termination. On June 5, 1957, CGU and CST entered
into an “Agreement between Claremont College and Southern California School of
Theology” (“1957 Agreement”), containing the procedure for establishing a
purchase price in the event the FOC is triggered. Per Code of Civil Procedure §
885.030 of the Marketable Record Title Act (“MRTA”), the power of termination
in the 1957 Deed expired in 1987, as no Notice of Preservation was recorded on
Parcels 1 and 2; accordingly, the restrictions became unenforceable. 
 
In or around August
2015, CST told CGU and Defendant Claremont University Consortium (“Consortium”)
that it was considering selling a portion of Parcels 1 and 2. CGU and
Consortium, in response, asserted that they still had a right under the 1957
Deed and related 1957 Agreement to purchase Parcels 1 and 2 at a price
substantially below current market value based upon the pricing formula in the
1957 Agreement. Additionally, in 1972 CGU conveyed a 60-foot parcel of property
(“60 Foot Parcel”) to CST (“1972 Deed”) which afforded CST additional access to
the property covered by the 1957 Deed. The 1972 Deed contains an option by
which CGU and Consortium have a right of first refusal to purchase the 60 Foot
Parcel. When CST informed CGU and Consortium that it was considering a sale of
Parcels 1 and 2, it also informed CGU and Consortium that the sale would have
to include the 60 Foot Parcel. CGU and Consortium demand that the 60 Foot
Parcel be valued separately and sold to them even if a third party would
ultimately purchase Parcels 1 and 2. 
 
In 2001, Consortium and
CST entered into an “Agreement between Claremont University Consortium and
Southern California School of Theology” (“2001 Agreement”), stating therein
that Consortium and CST “are currently parties” to the 1957 Agreement and that
they desired to “amend and reaffirm” the 1957 Agreement. The 2001 Agreement was
made based on the mistaken assumption that the powers of termination had not expired
and that Consortium was a party to the 1957 Agreement. The 2001 Agreement also
lacked consideration.
On November 30, 2016, CST filed a First
Amended Complaint, asserting causes of action against CGU, Consortium and Does
1-50 for:
1.                 
Quiet Title 
2.

2.

Case
No. 19PSCV00419 (i.e., “Claremont II”)
Plaintiff The Claremont Colleges, Inc. dba The Claremont
Colleges Services fka Claremont University Consortium (“Consortium”) alleges
that CST, after the trial of Claremont I,
secretly entered into a sale agreement with Yalong Investment Group, LLC
(“Yalong”) which represents a violation of Consortium’s right to purchase the
property under the FOC if the judgment is reversed, or the First Right of
Refusal (“FROR”) if the judgment in Claremont I is affirmed. Consortium
alleges that the sales agreement also constitutes a violation of the
Educational Use Restriction.
On October 23, 2019, the “Order Denying Plaintiff The
Claremont Colleges, Inc.’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction” was filed. On
December 5, 2019, the court sustained CST’s demurrer to Consortium’s First

A Status Conference Re: Related Cases
is set for March 1, 2024.
Case No. 21PSCV00726 (“Claremont
IV”)
Plaintiff Western University of Health Sciences
(“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
On or about June 3, 2021, Plaintiff and
CST entered into a “Revocable License Agreement for Certain Premises that
Comprise a Portion of the Claremont School of Theology Campus” (“License”),
which was for access, use and occupation of a portion of the premises located
at 1325 North College Avenue, Claremont, California (the “Premises”). Per the
License, the Base License Fee for the initial term of the License (i.e., 11
months) was a total of $1 million, which consisted of $100,000.00 payable on or
before the Possession Date set forth therein, $600,000.00 payable on or before
August 1, 2021 and $300,000.00 payable on or before December 31, 2021.
Plaintiff made the $100,000.00 payment and was thereafter permitted to occupy
the Premises. Before the $600,000.00 payment came due, Claremont Colleges
informed CST that CST was not in rightful possession of the Premises and that
it would seek a preliminary injunction, including against Plaintiff, relating
to CST’s entitlement to license the Premises or otherwise allow Plaintiff to
occupy the Premises. CST and Claremont Colleges have made conflicting demands
upon Plaintiff for payment.
On September 1, 2021, Plaintiff filed a Complaint in

designated as the lead case.
A Status Conference Re: Related Cases is set for March 1,
2024.
1.         Motion
for Summary Adjudication
Legal Standard
The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary
adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’
pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in
fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) “Code of
Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the
evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’
and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no
triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
a judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119 [emphasis theirs].)
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf
v. D.B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) “A plaintiff or
cross-complainant has met his or her burden of showing that there is no defense
to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the cause of
action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) “Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has met
that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show that
a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action
or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).)
Discussion
Yalong moves the court for an order granting summary
judgment in its favor and against CST on its cross-complaint; alternatively,
Yalong seeks summary adjudication with respect to the following causes of
action within the cross-complaint and issue of duty as follows:
•           Yalong’s Cross-Complaint, Fifth
Cause of Action for Declaratory Relief: A judicial declaration that:
(1) the Lease is rescinded, and (2) Yalong is entitled to repayment of the $10
Million Deposit plus prejudgment interest less any valid offset that CST is
able to prove. Yalong’s Motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure section
437c(f)(1) on the basis that the undisputed material facts show that Yalong is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law because there was a mutual mistake of
fact at the time the parties executed the Lease and a material failure of
consideration. See Cal. Civ. Code § 1689. 
•           CST’s duty and obligation to
return the $10 Million Deposit plus prejudgment interest to Yalong:
Yalong’s Motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 437c(f)(1) on
the basis that the undisputed material facts show that Yalong is entitled to
these funds because there was a mutual mistake of fact at the time the parties
executed the Lease and a material failure of consideration. See Cal. Civ. Code
§ 1689. 
Procedural
Deficiencies
The court
determines that Yalong’s alternate request for summary adjudication is
deficient.
California Rules
of Court (“CRC”) Rule 3.1350, subdivision (b) provides that “[i]f summary
adjudication is sought . . .  the
specific cause of action, affirmative defense, claims for damages, or
issues of duty must be stated specifically in the notice of motion and
be repeated, verbatim, in the separate statement of undisputed material facts.”
(Emphasis added). Subdivision (d) provides that “[t]he separate Statement of
Undisputed Material Facts in support of a motion must separately
identify: (A) Each cause of action, claim for damages, issue of duty, or
affirmative defense that is the subject of the motion; and (B) Each
supporting material fact claimed to be without dispute with respect to
the cause of action, claim for damages, issue of duty, or
affirmative defense that is the subject of the motion.” (Emphasis added). Yalong purports
to seek summary adjudication of the fifth cause of action for declaratory
relief and of CST’s purported duty to return the deposit, with interest to
Yalong; however, its separate statement fails to address the fifth cause of
action and issue of duty separately.
The court will
treat the instant motion as one for summary judgment only.
Request
for Judicial Notice
The court
rules on Yalong’s Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”) as follows: Granted as to
Exhibits 1 and 12-27.
Evidentiary
Objections
The court
rules on Yalong’s evidentiary objections as follows:
·                    
As to the Declaration of Dr. Kah-Jin Jeffrey
Kuan: Overruled as to Nos. 1, 4, 5 (i.e., as to first sentence only), 6 and
8-10 and Sustained as to Nos. 2, 3, 5 (i.e., as to second sentence only) and 7.
·                    
As to the Declaration of Charles M. Clark:
Overruled as to Nos. 11 and 14 and Sustained as to Nos. 12, 13 and 15.
Merits
Yalong claims that it is entitled to rescission of the
February 5, 2019 ground lease (the “Lease”) between Yalong and CST on the basis
of (1) mutual mistake and/or (2) material failure of consideration.[2]
On October 15, 2021, Plaintiff The Claremont Colleges, Inc.
dba The Claremont Colleges Services fka Claremont University Consortium
(“Consortium”) filed a Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) in this action against CST,
Yalong, Education Tomorrow, HPU, Mpire, and Western University of Health
Sciences for Specific Performance of Right of First Offer, Quiet Title Based on
Right of First Offer, Breach and Enforcement of 1957 Deed, Breach and
Enforcement of 1957 Agreement, Breach and Enforcement of 2001 Agreement, Breach
of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, Intentional
Interference with Right of First Offer, Declaratory Relief and Restitution and
Unjust Enrichment. (RJN, Exh. 23).
On April 20, 2022, Yalong filed the instant cross-complaint,
asserting causes of action against CST for Rescission of the Lease, Restitution,
Breach of Contract, Money Had and Received and Declaratory Relief. (RJN, Exh.
26). Yalong alleges therein that Consortium deeded the property located at 1325
North College Avenue, Claremont, California 91711 (“subject property”) to CST
on December 18, 1957 (“1957 Deed”) (Cross-Complaint, ¶¶ 4 and 5), that the 1957
Deed contained two restrictions, an Educational Use Restriction and a First
Offer Clause (Id., ¶ 6); that CST filed Claremont I on August 31,
2016, disputing Consortium’s position that the subject property was encumbered
by the Educational Use Restriction and that the First Offer Clause constituted
a right of first refusal in the event CST desired to sell the land (Id.,
¶ 7); that the trial court in Claremont I issued a statement of decision
on December 18, 2018 (and subsequently entered judgment on January 23, 2019),
determining that the Educational Use Restriction had expired but was
enforceable based upon principles of equitable estoppel and/or as an equitable
servitude and that the Right of First Offer was enforceable as a First Right of
Refusal (Id., ¶ 8); that Yalong and CST entered into a written ground lease
agreement (“Lease”) for the subject property dated February 5, 2019 (Id.,
¶ 9); that the Claremont I judgment was subsequently reversed by the
Court of Appeal on January 22, 2021 (Id., p. 3, fn. 1); that Consortium
filed Claremont II (the instant action) on May 3, 2019 against CST and
Yalong claiming, inter alia, that CST breached the 1957 Deed and related
agreements by entering into the Lease and that Yalong intentionally interfered
with said agreements (Id., ¶ 19); that on June 4, 2021, the Court of
Appeal reversed the trial court’s orders sustaining CST’s demurrers to
Consortium’s FAC and denying Consortium’s motion for a preliminary injunction
in Claremont II, finding that the Lease triggered the First Offer Clause
and directing that Consortium be give leave to file an amended complaint as
well as a renewed motion for a preliminary injunction (Id., ¶ 21); that
the court herein granted Consortium motion for preliminary injunction,
prohibiting Yalong from “using, occupying, or possessing any part of the
Property” and “purporting to grant through sublease, assignment or otherwise,
any defendant or third party any right to use, occupy, or possess any part of
the Property pending the final resolution of this case” (Id., ¶ 24);
that Yalong and CST entered into the Lease based on the mutual mistake of fact
that CST had the ability to lease and deliver the subject property to Yalong (Id.);
that CST did not have the ability to lease or deliver possession of the subject
property to Yalong (Id.); that Yalong is also entitled to rescission of
the Lease on the basis that CST has failed to provide the required
consideration under the Lease (specifically, possession) (Id., ¶ 31) and
that Yalong is entitled to repayment of the money it paid to CST under the
Lease, including the $10 million deposit (Id., ¶ 32).
Code of Civil Procedure § 1689 first provides, in relevant
part, that “[a] party to a contract may rescind the contract . . . (1) If the
consent of the party rescinding, or of any party jointly contracting with him,
was given by mistake, or obtained through duress, menace, fraud, or undue
influence, exercised by or with the connivance of the party as to whom he
rescinds, or of any other party to the contract jointly interested with such
party. . .(4) If the consideration for the obligation of the rescinding party,
before it is rendered to him, fails in a material respect from any cause.”
“[R]escission, when available, is an equitable remedy. The
purpose of rescission is to restore both parties to their former position as
far as possible and to bring about substantial justice by adjusting the
equities between the parties even though the status quo cannot be exactly
reproduced.” (Eminence Healthcare, Inc. v. Centuri Health Ventures, LLC
(2022) 74 Cal.App.5th 869, 881; see also Civ. Code §§ 1691[3]
and 1692[4]).
The procedural history of this matter is undisputed by the
parties. With that said, Yalong’s own moving papers reflect that there is a
triable issue of material fact relative to offset. (See Motion for Summary
Judgment or, in the alternative, Summary Adjudication, at 2, fn. 2 [“[t]o the
extent CST contends, and is able to prove in its Opposition, that it is
entitled to a[n] offset of some kind, Yalong is willing to consider stipulating
to such amount to avoid a disputed issue of fact. . .”], 19:3-6 and 19:18-21.)
Kuan attests that Yalong, following commencement of the Initial Term of the
Lease on February 5, 2019, was immediately given full access to the CST
Property and given specific space on the campus to conduct the process of
becoming a bona fide educational institution of collegiate grade. (Kuan Decl.,
¶ 5, lines 15-17). The court granted Consortium’s renewed Motion for
Preliminary Injunction on January 7, 2022 (nearly three years later),
which precluded Yalong, inter alia, from “using, occupying, or possessing any
part of the Property pending the final resolution of this case.” (UMF No. 58;
RJN, Exh. 25).
As an aside, the court notes as to CST’s laches and estoppel
argument that “[s]ince the 1961 amendments of sections 1691 and 1693 of the
Civil Code, reasonable diligence or promptness on the part of the party seeking
rescission is no longer a prerequisite for the remedy. The new requirement is
essentially one of freedom from laches. Its application depends on whether, under the
particular facts, the delay has in any way prejudiced the defendant.” (Wilke
v. Coinway, Inc. (1967) 257 Cal.App.2d 126, 140).
Yalong’s motion is denied.
2.         Motion to
Modify Preliminary Injunction
Legal Standard
“In any action, the court may on notice modify or dissolve an
injunction or temporary restraining order upon a showing that there has been a
material change in the facts upon which the injunction or temporary restraining
order was granted, that the law upon which the injunction or temporary
restraining order was granted has changed, or that the ends of justice would be
served by the modification or dissolution of the injunction or temporary
restraining order.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 533).
Discussion
Yalong moves the court, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
§ 533, for an order modifying Subdivision (g) of the preliminary injunction
entered January 7, 2022 (“Preliminary Injunction”) to state (additions in bold;
deletions in strikethrough):
CST is required to sequester in a
separate account, held in constructive 
trust pending the final resolution
of this case, all funds it has received, or 
will receive, from Yalong, all
parties the other defendants, or any third 
party in connection with the
Property, including but not limited to funds 
received from The Claremont
Colleges, Inc. in connection with a sale 
of the property.”
The January 7, 2022 Preliminary Injunction was entered
following Consortium’s motion for preliminary injunction.
Yalong contends that a material change has occurred since
the Preliminary Injunction was entered and that the ends of justice would be
served by a modification of the Preliminary Injunction. At the time the
Preliminary Injunction was entered, the “principal claims” in Consortium’s TAC
were for enforcement of the right to reacquire the property located at 1325
North College Avenue, Claremont, California 91711 (“Property”); since then, CST
and Consortium commenced and concluded an arbitration regarding the repurchase
price of the Property, which the arbitrator concluded should be $7,706,553.00.
(Buchignani Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. 2). Subdivision (g) of the Preliminary Injunction,
however, does not address funds received by CST from Consortium. Yalong
represents that the purpose of the modification is to require CST to hold any
funds it receives from Consortium in connection with the sale of the Property,
inasmuch as a sale of the Property from CST to Consortium appears “imminent.”
This modification will act to preserve the status quo of any funds transferred
between the parties pending resolution of the action, inasmuch as Yalong has
claims against CST that exceed $10,000,000.00. (See Yang Decl.).
Yalong, however, has failed to provide the court with any
authority which would authorize it to move to amend an order relating to a
motion for preliminary injunction filed by Consortium rather than filing
its own motion for preliminary injunction for the requested relief.
The motion is denied.
