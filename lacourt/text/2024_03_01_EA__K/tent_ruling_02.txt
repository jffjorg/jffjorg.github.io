[2]              Yalong’s motion for summary
judgment is focused entirely on the rescission cause of action; it is Yalong’s
position that “[t]he court’s entry of judgment as requested will resolve
Yalong’s entire Cross-Complaint because the remaining [causes of action] will
be moot.” (Motion 2:17-20). 


[3]              Civil Code § 1691 states, in
relevant part, that “[s]ubject to Section 1693, to effect a rescission a party
to the contract must, promptly upon discovering the facts which entitle him to
rescind if he is free from duress, menace, undue influence or disability and is
aware of his right to rescind: (a) Give notice of rescission to the party as to
whom he rescinds; and (b) Restore to the other party everything of value which
he has received from him under the contract or offer to restore the same upon
condition that the other party so likewise, unless the latter is unable or
positively refuses to do so. . .” 


[4]              Civil Code § 1691 states, in
relevant part, that “[i]f in an action or proceeding a party seeks relief based
upon rescission, the court may require the party to whom such relief is granted
to make any compensation to the other which justice may require and may
otherwise in its judgment adjust the equities between the parties.”
