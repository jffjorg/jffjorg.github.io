Background   
Case
No. KC068691 (i.e., “Claremont I”)
Plaintiff Southern California School
of Theology dba Claremont School of Theology (“CST”) alleges as follows:
On June 5, 1957, Defendant
Claremont Graduate University fka Claremont College and Claremont University
Center (“CGU”) conveyed approximately 16.4 acres of land contiguous to The
Claremont Colleges (“Parcels 1 and 2”) to CST in exchange for $107,500.00 via a
grant deed (the “1957 Deed”). The 1957 Deed contained two restrictions: (1) a First
Option Clause (“FOC”) and (2) an educational use restriction, both of which
were enforced by a power of termination. On June 5, 1957, CGU and CST entered
into an “Agreement between Claremont College and Southern California School of
Theology” (“1957 Agreement”), containing the procedure for establishing a
purchase price in the event the FOC is triggered. Per Code of Civil Procedure §
885.030 of the Marketable Record Title Act (“MRTA”), the power of termination
in the 1957 Deed expired in 1987, as no Notice of Preservation was recorded on
Parcels 1 and 2; accordingly, the restrictions became unenforceable. 
 
In or around August
2015, CST told CGU and Defendant Claremont University Consortium (“Consortium”)
that it was considering selling a portion of Parcels 1 and 2. CGU and
Consortium, in response, asserted that they still had a right under the 1957
Deed and related 1957 Agreement to purchase Parcels 1 and 2 at a price
substantially below current market value based upon the pricing formula in the
1957 Agreement. Additionally, in 1972 CGU conveyed a 60-foot parcel of property
(“60 Foot Parcel”) to CST (“1972 Deed”) which afforded CST additional access to
the property covered by the 1957 Deed. The 1972 Deed contains an option by
which CGU and Consortium have a right of first refusal to purchase the 60 Foot
Parcel. When CST informed CGU and Consortium that it was considering a sale of
Parcels 1 and 2, it also informed CGU and Consortium that the sale would have
to include the 60 Foot Parcel. CGU and Consortium demand that the 60 Foot
Parcel be valued separately and sold to them even if a third party would
ultimately purchase Parcels 1 and 2. 
 
In 2001, Consortium and
CST entered into an “Agreement between Claremont University Consortium and
Southern California School of Theology” (“2001 Agreement”), stating therein
that Consortium and CST “are currently parties” to the 1957 Agreement and that
they desired to “amend and reaffirm” the 1957 Agreement. The 2001 Agreement was
made based on the mistaken assumption that the powers of termination had not expired
and that Consortium was a party to the 1957 Agreement. The 2001 Agreement also
lacked consideration.
On November 30, 2016, CST filed a First
Amended Complaint, asserting causes of action against CGU, Consortium and Does
1-50 for:
1.

2.

2.                 
Breach and Enforcement of the 1957 Agreement

Case
No. 19PSCV00419 (i.e., “Claremont II”)
Plaintiff The Claremont Colleges, Inc. dba The Claremont
Colleges Services fka Claremont University Consortium (“Consortium”) alleges
that CST, after the trial of Claremont I,
secretly entered into a sale agreement with Yalong Investment Group, LLC
(“Yalong”) which represents a violation of Consortium’s right to purchase the

Refusal (“FROR”) if the judgment in Claremont I is affirmed. Consortium
alleges that the sales agreement also constitutes a violation of the
Educational Use Restriction.

Case No. 21PSCV00726 (“Claremont
IV”)
Plaintiff Western University of Health Sciences
(“Plaintiff”) alleges as follows:
On or about June 3, 2021, Plaintiff and
CST entered into a “Revocable License Agreement for Certain Premises that
Comprise a Portion of the Claremont School of Theology Campus” (“License”),
which was for access, use and occupation of a portion of the premises located
at 1325 North College Avenue, Claremont, California (the “Premises”). Per the
License, the Base License Fee for the initial term of the License (i.e., 11
months) was a total of $1 million, which consisted of $100,000.00 payable on or
before the Possession Date set forth therein, $600,000.00 payable on or before
August 1, 2021 and $300,000.00 payable on or before December 31, 2021.
Plaintiff made the $100,000.00 payment and was thereafter permitted to occupy
the Premises. Before the $600,000.00 payment came due, Claremont Colleges
informed CST that CST was not in rightful possession of the Premises and that
it would seek a preliminary injunction, including against Plaintiff, relating
to CST’s entitlement to license the Premises or otherwise allow Plaintiff to
occupy the Premises. CST and Claremont Colleges have made conflicting demands
upon Plaintiff for payment.

pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1286.2, subdivision (a)(4).
Request for Judicial Notice
The court grants Claremont Colleges’ Request for Judicial
Notice in full.
Merits
Claremont Colleges has
attached a copy of the written agreement dated June 5, 1957 (the “1957
Agreement”), which contains an arbitration provision. (Petition, Attachment
4(b), 1957 Agreement, ¶ 2(f)[1].) A
dispute arose between the parties as to the price to be paid in connection with
the repurchase of real property pursuant to a Final Judgment Following Appeal
entered in Case No. KC068691 (i.e., “Claremont I”). Paragraph 2(c) of
the 1957 Agreement states the following regarding a repurchase:
            In the event of such acceptance, the price shall be
computed as follows:
whichever
of the following defined amounts be lower, either (1) the fair 
market
value of the land granted, and the improvements and fixtures thereon, 
as
of the date when the notice of offer is given, or (2) the sum of the 
following
amounts: the purchase price of the land granted in the sale from 
College
to School plus taxes and assessments paid by School thereon since 
the
date of conveyance by College to School plus the original cost of 
improvements
and fixtures thereon but less a reasonable allowance for 
depreciation
and obsolescence of such improvements and fixtures. 
 
(Petition, Attachment
4(b), 1957 Agreement, ¶ 2(c).)
This matter proceeded to
arbitration, which was held on October 23-27, 2023 via Zoom before Arbitrator the
Honorable Ann Kough (“Ret.”) (“Arbitrator”) of JAMS. Claremont Colleges has
attached a copy of the arbitration award (“Award”), which was made on December
14, 2023. (Petition, Attachment 8(c).) Arbitrator concluded that “the
appropriate repurchase price under [clause 2(c)(2) of the 1957 Agreement (“the
Formula”)] is capable of being calculated, that it is less than [CST’s]
unreliable fair market value calculation, and, therefore, the repurchase price
is $7,706,553.00.”
CST seeks to vacate the
Award. “[A]rbitration awards are generally subject to extremely narrow judicial
review[.] Courts will not review the merits of the controversy, the validity of
the arbitrator’s reasoning or the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the
arbitrator’s award.” (Hoso Foods, Inc. v. Columbus Club, Inc. (2010) 190
Cal.App.4th 881, 887). “A trial court may vacate an award interpreting a contract if
and only if it ‘rests on a “completely irrational” construction of the contract
[citations] or ... amounts to an “arbitrary remaking” of the contract[.]’” (Cal.
Dept. of Human Resources v. Service Employees Internat. Union, Local 1000
(2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1420, 1430, quoting Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. v.
Intel Corp. (1994) 9 Cal.4th 362, 376-377).
CST contends that
Arbitrator exceeded her power under Code of Civil Procedure § 1286.2(a)(4)
because she “changed the language of the Formula in the 1957 Agreement” in
making the Award. (Vacate Award, 12:20-21). More specifically, CST argues that
Arbitrator “confirmed that she wholly relied on the changed language of the
Formula in the 1957 Agreement” “[o]n page four of the Arbitration Award (second
paragraph from the bottom)” and that Arbitrator “admits that no individual
could provide testimony as to the meaning of the actual language in the 1957
Agreement. (Id., 12:7-9 and 12:14-16). CST, however, fails to cite or
discuss any part of that paragraph. On the contrary, in that very paragraph,
the Arbitrator stated that she “f[ound] that the terms of the Formula are not
ambiguous and [that] no interpretation is necessary. See State of California
v. Continental Ins. (2012) 55 Cal.4th 186.”
CST’s cross-petition to vacate the award is denied. Claremont
Colleges’ petition to confirm is granted.
