And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Yalong Investment Group, LLC v. The Claremont Colleges, Inc. and Consortium. The case concerns a motion for summary judgment filed by Yalong, which seeks to rescind a contract. The judge notes that Yalong's motion is focused entirely on the rescission cause of action and that the court's entry of judgment as requested would resolve Yalong's entire cross-complaint.

The judge also notes that Civil Code ยง 1691 requires a party seeking to rescind a contract to give notice of rescission to the other party and to restore everything of value received under the contract. The judge also cites Civil Code ยง 1693, which allows the court to adjust the equities between the parties in an action or proceeding seeking relief based on rescission.

The judge concludes that the hearing scheduled for March 1, 2024, will proceed as planned, and that the parties should be prepared to discuss the issues of rescission and arbitration.
