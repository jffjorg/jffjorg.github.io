And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's ex parte application to seal 83 potential trial exhibits. The court finds that before sealing any exhibits, a trial court must provide notice to the public of the contemplated closure, hold a hearing, and make specific findings that an overriding interest exists, the interest supports sealing the record, and that a substantial probability exists that the interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed. The court concludes that the defendant has not made an individual showing of these factors and therefore will not seal the exhibits. The judge cites California case law and rules of court in support of the ruling.
