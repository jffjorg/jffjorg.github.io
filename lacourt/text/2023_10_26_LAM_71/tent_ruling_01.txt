  Case Number:  19STCV30305    Hearing Date:   October 26, 2023    Dept:  71 Jennifer Hua v. Western
Asset Management, LLC
19STCV31305

Defendant’s
ex parte application to seal trial exhibits

 
The
Court denies the application.  
Courtroom
proceedings in ordinary civil cases are "presumptively open."  (NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc.
v. Superior Court (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1217.)  Before sealing trial exhibits, a trial court must provide notice to the public of the
contemplated closure. 
When a motion seeking closure is made in a written filing, adequate
notice must be provided by publicly docketing the motion reasonably in advance
of a determination thereon. The notice requirement should not impose an onerous
or undue burden on trial courts. (Id.)
In addition, before sealing any exhibits, a trial court
must hold a hearing and expressly find that 
1) There exists an
overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record;
2) The overriding
interest supports sealing the record;
3) A substantial
probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the
record is not sealed;
4) The proposed sealing
is narrowly tailored; and
5) No less restrictive
means exist to achieve the overriding interest.

(Cal Rules of Court, Rule 2.550.)

            Defendant has requested
the Court seal 83 potential trial exhibits without any individual showing of
the factors above.  The Court will not do
so.
