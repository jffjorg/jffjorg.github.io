SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises from Plaintiff Elya Braden’s
(Plaintiff) purchase of a 2020 Chevrolet Bolt (the Vehicle) on 11/7/20.  (FAC ¶6). 
Plaintiff alleges that the Vehicle was not safe or functional because
the batteries may ignite when they are either fully charged or fall below the
seventy-mile range.  (FAC ¶18).
 
On 11/17/23, Plaintiff filed this action against
Defendant General Motors LLC (General Motors) and Defendant Paradise Chevrolet
for: (1) Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty; (2) Violation
of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Implied Warranty; (3) Violation of Song-Beverly
Act – Civil Code 1793.2; (4) Fraud; (5) Violation of Business & Professions
Code 17200 and (6) Negligent Repair.  After
meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the issues General Motors had with
Plaintiff’s original complaint, on 12/18/23, General Motors filed and served a demurrer
to the 4th and 5th causes of action and motion to strike
the prayer for punitive damages.  On
3/1/24, before the hearing on the demurrer, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint which alleges the same six causes of action as the original complaint.  As such, the hearing on the demurrer was
placed off calendar.  (See 3/12/24
Notice of Withdrawal; 3/13/24 Minute Order). 

 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the
issues General Motors had with the 4th and 5th causes of
action in the First Amended Complaint, General Motors filed and served the
instant demurrer to the 4th and 5th causes of action and
motion to strike which seeks an order striking the prayer “For…exemplary or
punitive damages… .”  Plaintiff filed a late
combined opposition to  the demurrer and
motion to strike and General Motors has filed a reply to the opposition.  Despite the late filing and service, the
Court considered the opposition in ruling on the demurrer and motion to
strike.  See CRC 3.1300(d).  
 
ANALYSIS
 
General Motors’ Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) is
granted.  
 
General Motors demurs to the 4th and 5th
causes of action on the ground that they fail to set forth sufficient facts to
constitute a cause of action.  CCP
430.10(e).
 
4th Cause of Action – Fraud
 
Plaintiff’s fraud claim is based on alleged affirmative
misrepresentations in the marketing the Vehicle as having long range capability
and fraudulent concealment with regard to mileage range and battery
safety.  (See FAC ¶¶92-105).
 
The elements of a claim for fraud based on
misrepresentation are: (1) misrepresentation, (2) knowledge of falsity, (3)
intent to induce reliance on the misrepresentation, (4) justifiable reliance on
the misrepresentation and (5) resulting damages.  Cansino (2014) 224 CA4th 1462, 1469.  The elements of a claim for fraud based on
concealment are: (1) the defendant concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2)
the defendant had a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the
defendant intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the intent to
defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff was unaware of the fact and would not
have acted as they  did if they had known
of the concealed or suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or
suppression of the fact, the plaintiff sustained damage.  Jones (2011) 198 CA4th 1187, 1198  Whether based on affirmative
misrepresentations or concealment, fraud claims must be pled with specificity
meaning with facts showing how, when, where, to whom and by what means the
allege fraud occurred.  Lazar
(1996)  12 C4th 631, 645; Tarmann
(1991) 2 CA4th 153, 157; Blickman Turkus, LP (2008) 162 CA4th 858,
878.  
 
With regard to the allegations within the fraud cause of
action, Plaintiff fails to allege: (1) the identity of the General Motors
employee that made the representations to, or concealed the facts from,
Plaintiff; (2) the employee’s authority to speak and act on behalf of General Motors;
(3) General Motor’s knowledge about alleged defects in the Vehicle at the time
of Plaintiff’s purchase, (4) what specific General Motors representations were reviewed
and relied on in purchasing the Vehicle; (5) how long prior to purchasing the
Vehicle the representations were reviewed, if even reviewed pre-purchase, and
which representation therein was relied upon; and (6) whether those materials
were prepared by General Motors or someone else (such as an independent
dealership).  Plaintiff also failed to
plead specific facts showing that General Motors intended to defraud Plaintiff
by either making affirmative statements or failing to disclose material facts.  See Tenzer (1985) 39 C3d 18, 30
(“something more than non-performance is required to prove the defendant’s
intent not to perform his promise”).
 
Plaintiff has failed to plead sufficient facts regarding
her justifiable reliance on the purported misrepresentations regarding the
long-range use and charging capabilities of the vehicle.  It is not clear where, when or if Plaintiff
saw/heard such representations before purchasing the Vehicle and/or from
whom.  (See FAC ¶92
(representations “made on GM’s website, among other places,” “echoed by GM’s
dealership personnel…”, ¶95 “false and misleading representations…were part of
an extensive advertising campaign…”).
 
To the extent the fraud/misrepresentation claim is based
on Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mileage range estimates, such cannot
form the basis for a fraud claim.  See
Gray (9th Cir. 2014) 554 Fed.Appx. 608, 609; Paduano
(2009) 169 CA4th 1453, 1470; (RJN, Park Decl., Ex.A); (FAC ¶20).
 
Plaintiff has also failed to sufficiently plead General
Motors had knowledge of the purported defects before Plaintiff purchased the
Vehicle and/or that Plaintiff’s Vehicle actually suffered from any purported
defect.  Plaintiff alleges General Motors
had general knowledge regarding battery issues with earlier model Bolt
vehicles.  (See FAC ¶¶21-27).  Plaintiff never specifically alleges what
issues she had with the subject vehicle. 
(See FAC ¶15 and preceding paragraphs)  
 
The First Amended Complaint also mentions representations
made by General Motors’ Vice-President Steve Hill regarding providing Plaintiff
with a new battery for the Vehicle and then reneging on such promise.  (See FAC ¶¶50-57).  Such representation was made after
Plaintiff’s purchase; therefore, Plaintiff could not have relied on the
representation in making the purchase. 
Additionally, such allegations are not specifically included in the
fraud cause of action.  (FAC
¶¶92-105).  As such, it is not clear whether
Plaintiff intended to base the fraud claim on this representation and/or how
she was damaged by same (i.e., by not selling the Vehicle or requesting that
General Motors repurchase the Vehicle sooner which Plaintiff alleges was
General Motors’ earlier practice?)  (See
FAC ¶¶53-56).   
 
“There are ‘four circumstances in which nondisclosure or
concealment may constitute actionable fraud: (1) when the defendant is in a
fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive
knowledge of material facts not known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant
actively conceals a material fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the
defendant makes partial representations but also suppresses some material
facts.’”  LiMandri (1997) 52 CA4th
326, 336.  Here, no fiduciary
relationship existed between Plaintiff and General Motors.  The remaining three circumstances require a
transaction between the parties giving rise to a duty to disclose.  Id. at 336-337.  Such a transaction has been held to require
direct dealings between the plaintiff and defendant.  Bigler-Engler (2017) 7 CA5th 276, 312,
314-315.
 
Here, Plaintiff admits that he did not buy the Vehicle
from General Motors and concludes that the dealership from which he actually
purchased the Vehicle was the agent of General Motors.  (FAC ¶¶6-11). 
Even if the agency allegations are deemed sufficient to support the
finding of a transactional relationship between Plaintiff and General Motors, Plaintiff
has failed to plead facts to establish that the concealment claim is not barred
by the economic loss rule.       
 
“[T]he economic loss rule allows a plaintiff to recover
in strict products liability in tort when a product defect causes damage to
‘other property,’ that is, property other than the product itself.  The law of contractual warranty governs damage
to the product itself.”  Robinson
Helicopter Co., Inc. (2004) 34 C4th 979, 989 citing Jimenez (2002)
29 C4th 473, 482-483.  “[W]here a
purchaser’s expectations in a sale are frustrated because the product he bought
is not working properly, his remedy is said to be in contract alone, for he has
suffered only ‘economic’ losses.” Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc., supra
at 988.  Further, emotional injuries
incidental to purely economic damages based on fraudulent concealment are also
barred by the economic loss rule. See Butler-Rupp (2005) 134
CA4th 1220, 1229.  Here, it is not clear
what damage Plaintiff is alleging other than that she would not have purchased
the Vehicle and that she suffered anxiety and fear after the purchase.  (FAC ¶¶48, 104, 105).      
 
Plaintiff’s reliance on Dhital (2022) 84 CA5th 828
for the proposition that the fraud claim is not barred by the “economic loss
rule” is unpersuasive.  First, Dhital
is under review by the Supreme Court of California as to the economic loss
rule; therefore, it is not citable. 
Additionally, the Court of Appeal has recently held that unless there is
a specific assertion of agency in the complaint, there is no showing of agency
between Ford and the authorized dealerships. 
See Ochoa (2023) 89 CA5th 1324 (review granted 7/9/23).  Here, Plaintiff has failed to allege
sufficient facts to support the conclusory allegation that “[t]he dealership is
an agent of GENERAL MOTORS for purposes of the sale.”  (See FAC ¶6).    
 
5th Cause of Action - Violation of
Business & Professions Code 17200 
 
A claim for violation of the unfair competition law (UCL)
may be based on allegations of unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business
practices by the defendant.  See
Business & Professions Code 1700, 1705. 
To the extent Plaintiff’s claim is based on fraudulent conduct by
General Motors, it fails for the same reasons set forth above regarding the
fraud cause of action.
 
The unlawful prong of the UCL “borrows violations of
other laws and treats them as unlawful practices,” which the UCL then “makes
independently actionable.”  Cel–Tech
Communications, Inc. (1999) 20 C4th 163, 180.  Here, Plaintiff has failed to identify any
underlying law on which the claim is based. 
(FAC ¶¶133-143).
 
As to the unfair prong, Plaintiff has failed to
sufficiently allege an established public policy which General Motors’ conduct
has violated or that its conduct was immoral, unethical, oppressive or
unscrupulous and causes injury to consumers which outweighs its benefits which
are necessary to state a claim.  See
McKell (2006) 142 CA4th 1457, 1473.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is sustained for the reasons set forth
above.  Due to the liberal policy of
allowing leave to amend and because this is only the First Amended Complaint
and the first time Plaintiff’s pleading has been ruled on by the Court,
Plaintiff is given the opportunity to try to cure the defects in the 4th
and 5th causes of action.   
 
The motion to strike addresses the prayer for relief in
relation to the 4th cause of action. 
Due to the ruling on the demurrer, the motion to strike is placed off
calendar as moot.  
 
A Second Amended Complaint is due within 30 days.
