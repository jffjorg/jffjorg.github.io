Background On May 22, 2019, Vahe Menachkanian and Maryet  Manaserian (“Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint relating to a laparotomy sponge allegedly  left in Plaintiff Menachkanian after surgery on May 25, 2018, against Defendants  Simon M. Keushkerian, M.D., Faisal A. Khan, M.D., Glendale Adventist Medical  Center, and DOES 1 through 20 for two causes of action: (1) Professional Negligence,  and (2) Loss of Consortium.  On November 30, 2023, Peter A. Hoshanan,  along with Eric Bonholtzer by attached declaration (“Counsel”) filed a motion  to be relieved as counsel. No opposition has been filed.  Legal  Standard The court may order that an attorney be changed or  substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon  request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.  (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where  conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the  representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The  determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies  within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.  Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)      An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on  Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of  Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1362(e)).      Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client  and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,  rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving  counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has  been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).)    Discussion Counsel has  filed and served forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053 for both Plaintiff Vahe Menachkanian  and Maryet Manaserian on all parties, including both Plaintiffs. Counsel  declared there are irreconcilable differences between attorney and client.  (MC-052s, No. 2.) Eric Bonholtzer.   There is  currently no Trial date set in this matter.     The Court finds  Counsel has filed all the necessary forms and has shown good cause to be  relieved as counsel. Therefore, the motion to be relieved is GRANTED.   Conclusion The motion to be  relieved as counsel is GRANTED.  The order is  effective upon the filing of a proof of service showing service of the order on  the clients.
