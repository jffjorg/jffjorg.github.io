And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the Judge's thinking based on the information presented before the hearing. The case involves a slip and fall accident that occurred on April 25, 2020, at a Walmart location in West Covina, California. The plaintiff, Mercedes Marisol Trejo, filed a complaint against Walmart, Inc., Rafael Garcia, and several Does. Walmart filed an answer to the complaint, and later filed a cross-complaint against Schindler Elevator Corporation and several Roes. Schindler was later dismissed from the case, and Walmart amended its cross-complaint to name TK Elevator Corporation as a defendant.

The Court is considering two motions: a motion to continue the trial date, filed by TK Elevators, and a motion for leave to amend the cross-complaint, filed by Walmart. The Court grants TK Elevators' motion to continue the trial date, finding that it has established good cause for the continuance. The Court also grants Walmart's motion for leave to amend its cross-complaint, finding that the amendment is necessary and proper.

The Court orders counsel for Walmart to give notice of the Court's ruling on both motions. The Court also sets a new trial date of October 1, 2024, and resets the final status conference and all deadlines accordingly.
