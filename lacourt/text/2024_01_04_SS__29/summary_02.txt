And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to be relieved as counsel, filed by Peter A. Hoshanan and Eric Bonholtzer, who represent the Plaintiffs Vahe Menachkanian and Maryet Manaserian. The motion was filed on November 30, 2023, and no opposition was filed. The Plaintiffs initially filed a complaint on May 22, 2019, alleging professional negligence and loss of consortium against the Defendants Simon M. Keushkerian, M.D., Faisal A. Khan, M.D., Glendale Adventist Medical Center, and DOES 1 through 20. The Judge notes that the court may order the substitution of counsel at any time and that an attorney is permitted to withdraw where conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the representation. The Judge finds that Counsel has filed all necessary forms and has shown good cause to be relieved as counsel, citing irreconcilable differences between attorney and client. The motion is therefore granted, and the order is effective upon the filing of proof of service showing service of the order on the clients. The Court continues the OSC re Dismissal (Settlement) to March 14, 2024, at 8:30 AM.
