And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Evolution Energy Solutions, LLC's motion to compel the deposition of Pamela Maxine Simuel, the plaintiff. The ruling also denies Evolution's request for monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act.

The court found that the plaintiff failed to appear at a properly noticed deposition without serving a valid objection in advance. The plaintiff's counsel advised Evolution's counsel three days in advance that the plaintiff would not attend the deposition, but did not offer alternative dates for the deposition.

The court granted the plaintiff's request for accommodations for the deposition, including taking the deposition in the office of the plaintiff's counsel, limiting the length of each session to two hours, and scheduling multiple sessions if necessary.

The court denied Evolution's request for monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act, finding that the plaintiff and her counsel acted with substantial justification and that it would be unjust to impose sanctions upon them.
