 Case Number:  22STCV17999    Hearing Date:   January 4, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s Counsel.
Tentative
The motion is GRANTED.
Background
On January 27, 2022, Michele Glenn
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint relating to an automobile accident on July 20,
2020, involving Defendants C&D Rentals, Kevin Ciara and DOES 1 through 10 for
two causes of action: (1) motor vehicle negligence, and (2) general negligence.

On November 2, 2023, Sarah Lopez (“Counsel”) filed
a motion to be relieved as counsel. No opposition has been filed. On December
5, 2023, Counsel filed the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel with the continued hearing date.
 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
 
Discussion
Counsel has
filed and served forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053 on Plaintiff. Counsel
declared there has been a breakdown of the attorney client relationship.
(MC-052, No. 2.) 
Trial was
recently continued to September 30, 2024.  
The Court finds
Counsel has filed all the necessary forms and has shown good cause to be
relieved as counsel. Therefore, the motion to be relieved is GRANTED.
 
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is GRANTED. 
The order is
effective upon the filing with the Court of a proof of service of the order on
the client.
Moving counsel
to give notice.
