  Case Number:  19STCV11835    Hearing Date:   January 4, 2024    Dept:  29  
Motion to Compel Plaintiff Responses to Form
Interrogatories (Set Three) and Special Interrogatories (Set Two) filed by Defendant ABM Industry Groups, LLC.
Tentative
The motions to compel initial responses to
form interrogatories and special interrogatories are GRANTED.
The requests for sanctions are GRANTED in
part.
Background
This arises from
a fall that allegedly occurred at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on April 12,
2017.  Plaintiff Samuel Aurebach
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action on April 5, 2019, asserting a cause of action
under premise liability against Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and Does
1 through 50.  Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center filed its Answer to the Complaint on May 10, 2019.
 
Plaintiff
amended his complaint on June 23, 2021, to name Defendant ABM Building
Solutions LLC as Doe 1 and Defendant ABM Global Facility Service as Doe 2.  At the request of Plaintiff, those two
entities were dismissed on April 27, 2022. 

 
Also on April
27, 2022, Plaintiff amended his complaint to name Defendant ABM Industries
Groups, LLC as Doe 3.  On June 10, 2022,
Defendant ABM Industry Groups, LLC (“ABM”) filed its Answer to the Complaint.
 
On May
12, 2023, ABM served Plaintiff with a series of discovery requests, including Form
Interrogatories (Set Three) and Special Interrogatories (Set Two).  (Radochonski Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff did not respond to this
discovery.  (Id., ¶ 5.)
 
On
October 12, 2023, ABM filed the two discovery motions that are set for hearing
on January 4: motions to compel Plaintiff to respond to the form
interrogatories and special interrogatories. 
ABM requests sanctions in each motion.
 
Plaintiff
has not filed any opposition to either motion.
 
The Court
is aware that additional discovery motions are on calendar in this matter for
January 5 and 19, 2024.
 
Trial is
scheduled for July 23, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
A party
must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order
compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd.
(b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no
meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a
party moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery
Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines
“[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.020, subd. (a).)
“[P]roviding
untimely responses does not divest the trial court of its authority [to hear a
motion to compel responses].”  (Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 407.)  Even if the untimely response “does not
contain objections [and] substantially resolve[s] the issues raised by a motion
to compel responses … the trial court retains the authority to hear the
motion.”  (Id. at pp. 408-409.)  This rule gives “an important
incentive for parties to respond to discovery in a timely fashion.”  (Id.
at p. 408.)  If “the propounding party [does not] take the motion off
calendar or narrow its scope to the issue of sanctions,” the trial court may
“deny the motion to compel responses as essentially unnecessary, in whole or in
part, and just impose sanctions.”  (Id. at p. 409.) “The court may
award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion
to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was filed, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1348(a).)  
Discussion
On May
12, 2023, ABM served Plaintiff with Form Interrogatories (Set Three) and Special
Interrogatories (Set Two).  (Radochonski
Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. A.)  Plaintiff
did not respond.  (Id., ¶ 5.)
 
ABM need
not show anything more.  The Court GRANTS
ABM’s motions to compel.
 
The Court also GRANTS in part ABM’s request for
monetary sanctions.  Given the relatively
straightforward nature of a motion to compel initial responses, and the
economies of scale associated with filing multiple discovery motions, the Court
sets sanctions on each motion in the amount of $510, calculated based on 2
hours of attorney work, multiplied by counsel’s reasonable billing rate of $225.00
per hour, plus the $60.00 filing fee.  (See
id., ¶ 6.)
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS ABM’s motions to compel.
 
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff to provide code-compliant,
verified, written responses, without objection, to ABM’s Form Interrogatories (Set Three) and Special
Interrogatories (Set Two) within 21 days of notice of this ruling.
 
The Court GRANTS in part ABM’s request for sanctions.
 
The Court ORDERS
Plaintiff and counsel of record the Law Offices of Jacob Emrani, jointly and
severally, to pay monetary sanctions under the Civil Discovery Act to ABM in
the amount of $1,020 ($510 per motion, multiplied by two motions) within 21 days of notice of this ruling. 
The Court ORDERS
moving party to give notice.
