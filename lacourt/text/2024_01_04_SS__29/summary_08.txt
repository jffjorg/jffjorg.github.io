```

And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to transfer the case to San Diego County Superior Court. The judge finds that the incident occurred at a mall in San Diego County, and all or substantially all of the witnesses live and work in San Diego County. The judge also finds that the parties have spent most of the past year identifying the proper parties, adding them to the case, and dismissing the original defendants, and that the Court has not yet issued any substantive rulings. The judge notes that while a plaintiff's choice of where to file is entitled to deference, technology can be used to address the practical problems that arise when witnesses reside some distance from the courthouse. The judge concludes that the moving parties have shown that there should be a transfer of venue under Code of Civil Procedure section 397, subdivision (c), and grants the motion to transfer the case to San Diego County Superior Court.
