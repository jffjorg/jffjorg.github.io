English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling orders the Plaintiff, Antonia Mendez, to provide further information and continue the hearing on the motion for monetary and non-monetary sanctions. The Plaintiff failed to provide verified, code-compliant responses to the Defendant's special interrogatories, and the responses contained objections that were later withdrawn. The Judge is concerned about the Plaintiff's failure to properly verify the responses, which contained a drafting error, and is ordering the Plaintiff to serve a proper verification within 7 days. Additionally, the Judge is ordering the Plaintiff to either serve a further supplemental response with the requested contact information for her family members or file a declaration explaining the "reasonable and good faith effort" made to obtain the information responsive to the interrogatories. The hearing on the motion for sanctions is continued until after the Plaintiff has addressed these issues.
