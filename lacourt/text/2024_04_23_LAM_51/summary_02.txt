English-text summary:

The Judge issued a tentative ruling on April 23, 2024, granting the defendants' motion to quash subpoenas for medical records. The plaintiffs issued four deposition subpoenas for treatment records of the defendants, including medical records related to sexual dependency, sexual addiction, sexual recovery, sexual aggression, and sexual assault. The defendants argued that the subpoenas were overly broad and sought to protect their medical records. The Judge found that the plaintiffs failed to show good cause to compel production of the requested documents and that the psychotherapist-patient privilege applies to the records. The Judge granted the defendants' motion and ordered the defendants to give notice.
