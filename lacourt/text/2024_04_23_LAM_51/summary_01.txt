English-text summary:

The tentative ruling addresses the demurrer to the Fourth and Fifth Causes of Action (negligent and intentional misrepresentation) filed by the defendants. The court finds that the plaintiff's allegations are defective and do not sufficiently plead reliance and damages. The court sustains the demurrer with leave to amend, meaning the plaintiff has the opportunity to re-file the complaint with the necessary allegations. The motion to strike portions of the complaint pertaining to punitive damages is denied as moot since the demurrer is sustained.
