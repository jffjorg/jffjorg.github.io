STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
On August 28, 2023, Plaintiff Cubosfera, LLC (Plaintiff)
filed a Complaint against Defendants Edward M. Buttwinick, as trustee of the
Buttwinick Family Trust a/r, dated June 11, 2019 and as trustee of the
Buttwinick Family Trust, dated May 4, 1990; Linda S. Buttwinick, as trustee of
the Buttwinick Family Trust a/r, dated June 11, 2019 and as trustee of the
Buttwinick Family Trust, dated May 4, 1990; Jill Buttwinick Zweier, as trustee
of the Buttwinick Family Trust, dated May 4, 1990; and Karen Buttwinick, as
trustee of the Buttwinick Family Trust, dated May 4, 1990 (Defendants). The
Complaint alleges seven causes of action for: (1) Declaratory Relief; (2)
Breach of Contract; (3) Constructive Eviction; (4) Negligent Misrepresentation;
(5) Intentional Misrepresentation; (6) Declaratory Relief; and (7) Nuisance. 
 
According to the Complaint, Plaintiff leased property
located at 13031 Montana Avenue (the Property) from Defendants. Plaintiff
alleges Defendants have failed and refused to permit Plaintiff to proceed with
a variance application and has refused to allow Plaintiff to operate its
business at the Property or be present at the Property. Plaintiff alleges it
was constructively evicted from the Property. 
 
On January 8, 2024, the Court granted Defendants’ demurrer to
the fourth and fifth causes of action with leave to amend. 

On February 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint
(“FAC”).
 
On March 18, 2024, Defendants filed the instant Demurrer and
Motion to Strike
 
On April 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed oppositions. 
 
On April 16, 2024, Defendants filed replies. 
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Meet and Confer 
 
Prior to filing
a demurrer, the demurring party is required to satisfy their meet and confer
obligations pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. (CCP) §430.41 and demonstrate that
they so satisfied their meet and confer obligation by submitting a declaration
pursuant to CCP §430.41(a)(2) & (3).¿The meet and confer requirement also applies to motions to strike. (CCP § 435.5.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff object to the demurrer and motion to strike
due to lack of meet and confer. (See Opposition to Demurrer, 5:7-6:28.) Still, failure to meet and confer is not a
sufficient ground to overrule or sustain a demurrer. (CCP § 430.41(a)(4).)¿
 
Plaintiff
further object on the ground that the demurrer was filed late. Defendants contend that Plaintiff has
waived any objection based on timeliness by filing an opposition instead of a
motion to strike the demurrer or moving for default. (Reply, 5:26-6:8.)
 
Demurrer¿ 
¿ 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint
states a cause of action.¿(Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering
demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context.¿In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via
proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. …. The only
issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”¿(Hahn¿147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)¿ 
¿ 
Motion to Strike¿ 
¿ 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. (CCP § 436(a).) The court may also
strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with
the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Id., § 436(b).) The grounds for moving
to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.
(Id.¿§¿437.)¿“When the defect which
justifies striking a complaint is capable of cure, the court should allow leave
to amend.” (Vaccaro v. Kaiman¿(1998)
63 Cal.App.4th 761, 768.)¿  
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Fourth & Fifth Causes
of Action – Negligent Misrepresentation & Intentional Misrepresentation
 
Defendants contend that the FAC did not correct the defects
that existed in the original pleading. The misrepresentation causes of action
fail because Plaintiff cannot allege damages or justifiable reliance, because the
mistake in the contract as to the name of the parties was a harmless scrivener’s
error. Plaintiff argues that the identity of a party to a contract is a
material representation, and that it sufficiently pled damages because it would
not have incurred the rental costs and consultant fees but for Defendants’
misrepresentation of the identity of the true owners. Defendants Reply points
out logical fallacies in Plaintiff’s arguments and maintains that Plaintiffs
cannot allege with the requisite specificity the reliance and damages elements.
 
“The essential¿elements¿of a
count for¿intentional¿misrepresentation¿are (1) a¿misrepresentation, (2) knowledge
of falsity, (3)¿intent¿to induce reliance,¿(4) actual and justifiable reliance,
and (5) resulting damage. [Citation.] (Chapman
v. Skype, Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 217, 230-31.) “ ‘ “The elements of negligent misrepresentation are similar to intentional fraud except for the
requirement of scienter; in a claim for negligent misrepresentation, the plaintiff need not allege
that the defendant made an intentionally false statement, but simply one as to
which he or she lacked any reasonable ground for believing the statement to be
true.” [Citations.] [Citation.]’ ” (Bains v. Moores (2009) 172
Cal.App.4th 445, 454.) “Causes of action for intentional and negligent misrepresentation sound in fraud and, therefore,
each element must be pleaded with specificity. [Citations.]” (Daniels v. Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc.
(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1150, 1166, disapproved of on other grounds by Sheen v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2022)
12 Cal.5th 905.)  
 
A cause of action for fraud must
be alleged with specificity such that Plaintiff pleads facts that “show how,
when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12
Cal.4th 631, 645.) Similarly, “[t]he requirement of specificity in a fraud
action against a corporation requires the plaintiff to allege the names of the
persons who made the allegedly fraudulent representations, their authority to
speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or
written.” (Tarmann v. State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.) 
 
Upon reviewing the FAC, the court agrees that Plaintiff,
once again, has not sufficiently alleged causes of action for negligent or
intentional misrepresentation. In particular, Plaintiff has not sufficiently
alleged facts indicating reliance and damages. The only alleged
misrepresentation is that the 2019 Buttwinick Trust owned the Property at the
time of the lease. However, the contract identified the landlord as the 1990
Buttwinick Trust. The 1990 Trust has as Trustees defendants Edward and Linda
Buttwinick. The 2019 Trust includes their children, Jill and Karen Buttwinick
as additional trustees. Plaintiff alleges that it was damaged because it would
have never entered the Lease had it known the true identity of the landlord.
Plaintiff claims that the landlord it believed it was renting from would be
amenable to the use proposed use and that landlord would work collaboratively
with Plaintiff as the landlord had with the School of the Arts. Plaintiff
claims that the actual landlord was a different entity all together. But
throughout the FAC and Opposition, Plaintiff glosses over who it thought the landlord
was. Instead, Plaintiff uses vague phrases like “a landlord that was amenable.”
(FAC ¶¶ 43, 76, 88, Opposition pp. 8, line 18 and 14, line 5). The FAC has no
allegations as to how Edward and Linda Buttwinik as trustees of the 2019 trust
are fundamentally different from Edward and Linda Buttwinik as trustees of the
1990 trust. The FAC does not contain factual allegation as to why Plaintiff
would have been willing to work with Edward and Linda Buttwinick as trustees of
one Buttwinick trust but not as trustees of another Buttwinick Family Trust. The
Opposition does not cite to any portion of the FAC where Plaintiff states why
it would not have entered the Lease if the landlord was identified as the 1990
Trust and not the 2019 Trust. 
 
The FAC falls short of the pleading standard for causes of
action based in fraud. Plaintiffs have also failed to explain how the alleged
misrepresentation is material.
 
Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS Defendants’ demurrer to
the Fourth and Fifth Causes of Action without leave to amend.
 
Motion to Strike
 
Defendants move to strike the following portions of the
Complaint pertaining to punitive damages:
·       Paragraph
94, 18:25-19:3 – “Defendants’ conduct was intentional and malicious . . .
Defendants thus acted with the intention to deceive and defraud Plaintiff and
are guilty of fraud, oppression and malice. Plaintiff accordingly also seeks an
award of exemplary and punitive damages against Defendants in an amount to be
determined at trial.”
·       Prayer
for Relief, Paragraph 5, lines 9-10 – “As to all applicable causes of action,
for punitive and exemplary damages, in an amount according to proof.”
In light of the ruling on demurrer, the motion to
strike is MOOT. 
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.Demurrer to the Fourth and Fifth
Causes of Action is SUSTAINED with leave to amend;
2.Motion to Strike is DENIED as
moot.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
