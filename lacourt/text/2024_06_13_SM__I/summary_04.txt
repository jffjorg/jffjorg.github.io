English text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a dispute between a plaintiff and a defendant over a lease agreement. The plaintiff had leased a location in Westwood Village to open a restaurant, but the landlord failed to install a 3000 gallon grease interceptor as required by the lease. The parties went to arbitration, where the arbitrator awarded fees to the landlord. The plaintiff challenged the award, arguing that the arbitrator exceeded his authority and erred in calculating the fees. The judge has ruled that the arbitration award is confirmed, and the plaintiff's motion to vacate or correct the award is denied. The plaintiff has 20 days to submit a proposed judgment.
