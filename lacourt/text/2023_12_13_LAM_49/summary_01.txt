And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The plaintiff, Kyung Mi Ha, and the defendant, Jaekyong L. Han, are parties to a contract regarding a loan from Bank of the West to First A&A Capital, LLC. The contract requires the parties to advance sums to the company to pay off the loan. The defendant failed to make a payment to the plaintiff, and the property was sold. The plaintiff is seeking damages for the defendant's breach of contract.

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer is without merit and has ordered the defendant to file an answer to the first amended complaint within 21 days. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff's damages are not speculative and that the contract does not contain any provision providing for recovery of losses due to currency rate fluctuations in the currency markets.
