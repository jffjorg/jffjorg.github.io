 Case Number:  23VECV00647    Hearing Date:   October 15, 2024    Dept:  T 
Tarzana
v Work 23VECV00647
Motion
to stay proceedings:
Ronald
Reinsdorf moves to stay this case pending an appeal of his motion to
intervene.  This court denied his motion to intervene.  He has
another action which is currently pending in another lawsuit.  The lawsuit
in the other action and the proposed complaint in intervention in this action
are the same.  The Court (Judge Kenny) found that this case (23VECV00647)
and the other case (24VECV03344), are not related within the meaning of
California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a). 
There
is no automatic stay required in the appeal of a motion to intervene.  In
light of Judge Kenny's ruling that is case is unrelated to the (in essence)
proposed complaint in intervention, and the court's analysis denying the motion
to intervene, the court denies the motion to stay this action.
Discovery
motion:
Defendant
filed a motion seeking: (1) compelling Plaintiff to attend her deposition, on
grounds that Plaintiffs has failed to appear at the scheduled event, (2) for
monetary sanctions of $1060 against Plaintiff and her counsel, and (3) to
shorten time for motion to compel further responses after the deposition. 
There
is no pending motion to compel further responses, so the court is unaware of
what plaintiff is requesting.
As
it appears that the deposition has been completed and the only remaining issue
is sanctions.  The court declines to award monetary sanctions as it
appears the motion was unnecessary. 
It
is so ordered, Clerk to give notice.
