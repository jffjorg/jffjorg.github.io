And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for trial setting priority without prejudice. The plaintiff, who is 90 years old, submitted a declaration stating that he suffers from various medical conditions, has difficulty hearing, and experiences general body pain and stress from the case. However, the judge found that the declaration is insufficient to support the need for priority, as it lacks specific details about the plaintiff's medical conditions and how failure to grant priority would cause him prejudice. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's age alone is not sufficient to obtain trial setting priority, citing California Civil Jury Instructions (CACI) life expectancy tables. The motion was denied without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff may refile the motion with additional evidence of his health conditions.
