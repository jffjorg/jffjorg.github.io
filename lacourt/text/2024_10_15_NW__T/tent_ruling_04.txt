 Case Number:  24VECV02353    Hearing Date:   October 15, 2024    Dept:  T 24VECV02353 Broumandi v Lavian
The motion for trial setting priority is
denied without prejudice.
The Declaration of Mr. Madnick is
insufficient to support the need for priority.  Plaintiff’s age of 90,
alone, is not enough to obtain trial setting priority.  The motion is made
pursuant to CCP section 36(a) which requires that  (1)
the party has a substantial interest in the action as a whole, and
(2) the party’s health is such that preference is necessary “to
prevent prejudicing the party’s interest in the litigation.” (Emphasis added.)
To that end, there must be some
evidence of the plaintiff’s health.  In Mr. Madnick’s
declaration, the references to his client’s health are as follows: He suffers
from various medical conditions.  He has a difficult time hearing. 
Ha has general body pain in his knees and joints.  He has stress from the
case.  His health continues to decline. 
There is no description of
the various medical conditions. No mention is made of how failure to grant
priority causes him prejudice because of his hearing loss.  No mention is
made of how failure to grant priority causes him prejudice because of aches and
pains in his knees and joints. There is no mention of how his health
continues to decline. At a minimum, the declaration should disclose counsel’s
understanding of the plaintiff’s medical diagnosis and prognosis.  Again,
age alone is insufficient under the law. Under Life Expectancy Tables in CACI,
a man of plaintiff’s age has an estimated life expectancy of 4.5+ years. This
is not a personal injury case.  The Elder Abuse claim is for financial
abuse.
In the absence of any
additional evidence, on information and belief or otherwise, of the plaintiff’s
health conditions which would make preference necessary to prevent prejudice,
the court denies the motion without prejudice.
