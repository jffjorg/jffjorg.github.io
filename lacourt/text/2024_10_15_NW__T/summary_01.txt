And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion to consolidate the two actions and stay the consolidated action. The defendants, Fox Rothschild LLP and Conrad Wilton, requested that the two actions be consolidated and stayed due to the common questions of law or fact involved in both cases. However, the judge found that the defendants failed to show that the entirety of the related action is pending before the court, and therefore failed to meet their initial burden on the motion to consolidate. The judge also noted that the related action is currently on appeal from the denial of two Anti-SLAPP motions, and therefore the court does not have jurisdiction over a portion of the related action. As a result, the judge exercised its discretion to maintain the independence of the two actions, at least until the appeals are resolved and the court of appeal issues its remittitur.
