And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on several motions in the case 23VECV00647. Ronald Reinsdorf, the defendant, is moving to stay the proceedings pending his appeal of the denial of his motion to intervene. The court has denied his motion to intervene, finding that the two cases are not related. As a result, the court denies his motion to stay the proceedings.

The defendant has also filed a motion for discovery, seeking to compel the plaintiff's attendance at a deposition, monetary sanctions of $1060 against the plaintiff and her counsel, and to shorten the time for a motion to compel further responses. Since the deposition has been completed, the only remaining issue is the request for sanctions. The court declines to award monetary sanctions, finding that the motion was unnecessary.

The court orders that notice be given to all parties.
