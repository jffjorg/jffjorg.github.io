And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Said Hakim, moved the court to determine the privileged status of emails between his brother, Michael Hakim, and attorney Benjamin Brin. The emails were produced in February 2022 and were referred to in responses to interrogatories and included as evidence in a motion for summary judgment. Papillones, LLC, the plaintiff, sought to clawback the emails, claiming they were privileged. The court reviewed the emails and found them to be protected by the attorney-client privilege. The court denied Said Hakim's motion to challenge the privilege clawback and ruled that the emails are privileged and may not be used by any party without the consent of Michael Hakim. The motion for summary judgment is continued to a date to be determined at the hearing. The parties are permitted to provide revised memoranda of points and authorities and opposition thereto pursuant to statutory filing deadlines.
