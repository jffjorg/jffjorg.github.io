And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court grants Plaintiff Julia Feliciano's motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint, conditionally. Plaintiff must file the Second Amended Complaint within 10 days of the entry of this order. The Second Amended Complaint will add Los Angeles Surrogacy as a defendant to the action. The Court finds that allowing the amendment is proper, despite certain procedural errors in the motion, because the case is less than a year old and the addition of Los Angeles Surrogacy could have been done earlier. The Court assumes that the Second Amended Complaint will only differ by adding a new defendant.
