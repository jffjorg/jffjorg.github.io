And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Keyhan Ghotbi, the plaintiff, against Rouhani Construction, Inc., the defendant. The demurrer was filed in response to the defendant's First Amended Cross-Complaint. The judge sustained the demurrer with 30 days leave to amend as to the first and third causes of action, and sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the second cause of action.

The first cause of action is for breach of contract, and the judge found that the defendant did not sufficiently allege the terms of the agreement. The second cause of action is for unjust enrichment, and the judge found that this claim is not a cause of action in California. The third cause of action is for common counts, and the judge found that the defendant did not properly plead the terms of the agreement.

The judge noted that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint, and that a court may not consider matters outside the pleading that are not judicially noticeable. The judge also applied the sham pleading doctrine, which states that a court is not bound to accept as true allegations contrary to factual allegations in former pleadings in the same case.

The judge gave the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint, and the case will be heard on May 15, 2024.
