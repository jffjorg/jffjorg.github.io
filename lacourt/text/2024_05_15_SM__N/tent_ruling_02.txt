 Case Number:  22SMCV00457    Hearing Date:   May 15, 2024    Dept:  N TENTATIVE RULINGPlaintiff/Cross-Defendant Keyhan Ghotbi’s Demurrer to Cross-Complainant, Rouhani Constructin [sic], Inc’s [sic] First Amended Cross-Complaint (Erroneously Filed as Cross-Complaint on 10/20/2023) is SUSTAINED with thirty (30) days leave to amend as to the first and third causes of action and SUSTAINED without leave to amend as to the second cause of action.Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Keyhan Ghotbi to give notice. REASONINGPlaintiff/Cross-Defendant Keyhan Ghotbi (“Plaintiff”) demurs to each cause of action alleged in Cross-Complainant/Defendant Rouhani Construction, Inc. (“Defendant”)’s First Amended Cross-Complaint (“FACC”). Cross-Defendant Haleh Ghotbi has filed a joinder to Plaintiff’s demurrer. The Court notes that the pleading is said to be the initial Cross-Complaint, but because it differed from the pleading for which the Court granted leave to file, it was a First Amended Cross-Complaint, and the Court refers to it as such.“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.) A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (See Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their contents].) For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true (Aubry v. Tri-City Hosp. Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967), but the Court does not “assume the truth of contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law” (Moore v. Regents of University of California (1990) 51 Cal.3d 120, 125).Leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (See Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349 [court shall not “sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment”]; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2002) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1037 [“A demurrer should not be sustained without leave to amend if the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause of action under any theory or if there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured by amendment.”]; Vaccaro v. Kaiman (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 761, 768 [“When the defect which justifies striking a complaint is capable of cure, the court should allow leave to amend.”].) The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)Sham PleadingPlaintiff argues that the initial Cross-Complaint, deemed filed on November 19, 2023, alleged a written contract and oral agreement, while the FACC now alleges only a written contract, rendering the pleading a sham. Under the sham pleading doctrine, “a court is not bound to accept as true allegations contrary to factual allegations in former pleading in the same case.” (Vallejo Development Co. v. Beck Development Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 929, 946.) The Court is not inclined to find that the omission of an oral agreement constitutes a sham pleading. Defendant is entitled to narrow its allegations in an amended pleading. Should an oral agreement exist that affects the applicability of a written contract, this may be presented in the submission of evidence. Plaintiff’s demurrer on this basis is OVERRULED.First Cause of Action: Breach of ContractTo state a cause of action for breach of contract, Plaintiff must be able to establish “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.)If a breach of contract claim “is based on alleged breach of a written contract, the terms must be set out verbatim in the body of the complaint or a copy of the written agreement must be attached and incorporated by reference.” (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 307.) In some circumstances, a plaintiff may also “plead the legal effect of the contract rather than its precise language.” (Construction Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198-199.)Defendant alleges that it entered into a written agreement with Plaintiff for services, material, and delivery of material for construction of the property in January 29, 2021; Plaintiff agreed to pay Defendant for services and material provided and work performed; Plaintiff made partial payment, leaving a balance of $25,000; Defendant has performed all conditions and obligations under the contract; and Plaintiff has failed to compensate Defendant as required under the contract. (FACC ¶¶ 16-17.) This does not sufficiently allege the terms of the agreement; Defendant must provide either a copy of the written agreement or set out the terms verbatim, as several terms remain unclear, such as when and how Plaintiff was required to repay Defendant. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s demurrer to the first cause of action is SUSTAINED with thirty (30) days leave to amend.Second Cause of Action: Unjust Enrichment“The elements for a claim of unjust enrichment are receipt of a benefit and unjust retention of the benefit at the expense of another. The theory of unjust enrichment requires one who acquires a benefit which may not justly be retained, to return either the thing or its equivalent to the aggrieved party so as not to be unjustly enriched.” (Lyles v. Sangadeo-Patel (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 759, 769, quotation marks and citations omitted.)Notably, “[u]njust enrichment is not a cause of action”; it is simply “a restitution claim.” (Hill v. Roll International Corp. (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 1295, 1307; see also Melchior v. New Line Productions, Inc. (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 779, 793 [“there is no cause of action in California for unjust enrichment”].) Given that Defendant’s claim merely seeks repayment of funds owed under the alleged contract, there is no basis for a separate claim of unjust enrichment. Thus, Plaintiff’s demurrer to the second cause of action is SUSTAINED without leave to amend.Third Cause of Action: Common CountsThe required elements of a common count claim are “(1) the statement of indebtedness in a certain sum, (2) the consideration, i.e., goods sold, work done, etc., and (3) nonpayment. A cause of action for money had and received is stated if it is alleged the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff in a certain sum for money had and received by the defendant for the use of the plaintiff.” (Farmers Insurance Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445, 460, citation and quotation marks omitted.)Plaintiff demurs to the third cause of action on the ground that Defendant has alleged the existence of a written contract, thereby making his common counts claim improper because it is based on an express contract. Defendant may plead this claim in the alternative, but the basis for the claim remains unclear, as Defendant has not properly pled the terms of the agreement between the parties. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s demurrer to the third cause of action is SUSTAINED with thirty (30) days leave to amend.
