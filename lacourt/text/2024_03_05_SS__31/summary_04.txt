And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Marshalls' motion to enforce a court order and for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff Chad Tewksberry. The motion was filed on behalf of TJX Inc, TJX Companies, Inc, and Marshalls of CA, LLC, who are seeking to enforce a court order granting their motions to compel and imposing sanctions against Plaintiff's counsel. The sanctions were ordered to be paid within 20 days, but Marshalls claims that they have not been paid. The judge has ruled that sanctions orders are enforceable as money judgments and that the remedy to enforce payment of monetary sanctions is to obtain and levy a writ of execution on assets of the debtor. The judge has also rejected Marshalls' request for additional monetary sanctions. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the hearing date and time, counsel's contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.
