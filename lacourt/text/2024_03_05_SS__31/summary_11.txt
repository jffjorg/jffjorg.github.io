The County moved to strike the prayer after the Plaintiff failed to oppose the motion. The Judge found that the complaint does not allege any facts that the County engaged in malicious or oppressive conduct toward the Plaintiff, and therefore the motion is granted. The Judge also denied the Plaintiff's request to amend the complaint, as the Plaintiff failed to demonstrate how the complaint could be amended to support a claim for punitive damages. The motion is granted without leave to amend.
