And here is the English text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Edgar Esturban vs. Irlanda Sanchez, ET AL. (Case No. 22STCV08568). Plaintiff Edgar Esturban had propounded requests for admissions (RFAs) to ZLS Trans Inc. (ZLS) on March 31, 2023, but ZLS failed to serve responses. Plaintiff filed a motion to deem the RFAs admitted against ZLS, which ZLS opposes. The Court finds the motion moot since ZLS has served the outstanding RFAs prior to the hearing. The only remaining issue is sanctions, and the Court imposes monetary sanctions of $560 against ZLS and its counsel for failing to serve timely responses to RFAs.
