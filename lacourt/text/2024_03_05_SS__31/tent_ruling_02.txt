 Case Number:  20STCV23658    Hearing Date:   March 5, 2024    Dept:  31 DEPT:  31 HEARING DATE: 03/05/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER: 20STCV23658 GERTEL DAVIS, et al. vs ACSB, LLC PETITION TO APPROVE COMPROMISE OF PENDING ACTION OF A MINOR GERTEL DAVIS, Age 81 RECOMMENDATION: DENY  TENTATIVE¿ ¿ The Court excuses the personal appearance of Claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may appear by telephone or video conference call.¿  Plaintiff/Claimant Gertel Davis (“Claimant”) agreed to settle her claims against Defendant for the total amount of $125,000. If the settlement is approved, $41,250 will be used for attorneys’ fees, and $6,163.44 will be used for costs. The net balance of $77,586.56 will be apportioned as follows: (1) $57,586.56 to be deposited into a blocked account, and (2) $20,000 to be held on proposed conditions.   The Court reviews the settlement and finds it fair and reasonable.¿The Court also finds the attorney’s fees fair and reasonable, in that Counsel’s declaration properly supports the request of 33% of Claimant’s settlement.  Although Claimant’s counsel has cured the defects previously identified in the prior denial, the Court denies the petition filed on December 22, 2023 for the following reasons:¿¿  Now that Petitioner has indicated the disposition of the funds, Petitioner failed to provide the requisite Attachments for the choices marked. Petitioner must provide the name, branch, and address of the depository as Attachment 18b(2) for the $57,586.56, and must also provide the proposed conditions of the remaining $20,000 as Attachment 18b(8). Without these requisite attachments, it is unclear where the net proceeds are to be deposited, and under what conditions sought by the Petitioner.   Petitioner must file a new petition curing the above-noted defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date. ¿¿  Moving party is ordered to give notice.
