The judge has ordered the defendant and his counsel to pay the sanctions to the plaintiff within 20 days. The judge has also noted that the parties should meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement, and that if a party intends to submit to the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
