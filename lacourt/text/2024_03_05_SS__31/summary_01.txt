And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is in favor of the plaintiff, Suzette Gonzalez, and against defendants Gustavo Gomez Garcia and New Ride Taxi. The court grants a default judgment against the defendants in the amount of $275,000 for general damages and $623 for costs. The court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to $275,000 in general damages, which is capped at $500,000 as per California Code of Civil Procedure § 580(a) and Airs Aromatics, LLC v. CBL Data Recovery Technologies, Inc. (2018) 23 Cal.App.5th 1013, 1018. The court also awards the plaintiff costs in the amount of $623, but strikes a portion of the request for costs as ambiguous. The defendant's failure to respond to the lawsuit and the plaintiff's dismissal of unnamed Doe defendants have led to this default judgment.
