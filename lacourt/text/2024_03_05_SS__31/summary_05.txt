And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Michelle C. Kim, issued a tentative ruling on March 4, 2024, in the case of Esther Naghi-Eghbal vs. Century Hill Association. The case involves a motion to set aside a dismissal of the action, which was granted on October 18, 2022, due to the plaintiff's failure to serve discovery responses in compliance with the court's August 18, 2022 order.

The judge found that the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal was untimely, as it was filed one day late, and therefore denied the motion. The judge also found that the plaintiff had failed to provide sufficient information regarding the discovery responses that led to the terminating sanctions and whether the issue had been cured.

The judge noted that a motion under CCP § 473(b) for relief from a terminating discovery sanction must be made within a reasonable time, not exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken. In this case, the plaintiff's motion was filed six months and one day after the dismissal, which exceeded the six-month limit.

The judge also noted that a motion under CCP § 473(b) for relief from a terminating discovery sanction must be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed and must be made within a reasonable time, not exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken. In this case, the plaintiff's motion was not accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed, and the motion was not made within a reasonable time.

The judge ordered the parties to meet and confer after reading the tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, the party must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
