Plaintiff Aries Global Logistics, Inc. is ordered to pay defendant Valley of the Sun Cosmetics, LLC total sanctions of $2,840.BACKGROUNDOn 2/5/2021, plaintiff Aries Global Logistics, Inc. (“Plaintiff” or “AGL”) filed this action.On 5/6/2024, Plaintiff filed the operative Fourth Amended Complaint (“4AC”) against defendants Valley of the Sun Cosmetics, LLC (“VOTS”), Ajmal Shehzad, Sofia Shehzad, Danish Gajiani, Faizan Bakali, Clean Beauty Concepts, LLC, Mad Engine, LLC, and Does 1-50, inclusive, asserting causes of action for (1) breach of written contract, (2) declaratory relief, (3) injunctive relief, (4) breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (5) quantum meruit, (6) account stated, (7) fraud, (8) fraudulent conveyance, and (9) intentional interference with contractual relations.The 4AC alleges that this action arises from VOTS’s failure to pay Plaintiff for services Plaintiff performed (i.e., freight forwarding and storage of hand sanitizer bottles and caps during the COVID-19 pandemic) pursuant to the parties’ written contract.On February 20, 2024, VOTS filed the instant motions to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to its Form Interrogatories, Set One (“FROG”), Request for Production of Documents, Set One (“RPD”), Special Interrogatories, Set One (“SROG”), and Request for Admission, Set One (“RFA”).As of June 10, 2024, no opposition or reply has been filed.LEGAL STANDARDA. Demand for Production“On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following apply: ¶ (1) A statement of compliance withthe demand is incomplete. ¶ (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. ¶ (3) An objection in the response is without merit or too general.” Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a). “The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).B. Interrogatories“On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following apply: ¶ (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. ¶ (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate. ¶ (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.” Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).C. Request for Admission“A party to a civil action may propound a written request that another party ‘admit the genuineness of specified documents, or the truth of specified matters of fact, opinion relating to fact, or application of law to fact.’ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.010; [citation].)” City of Glendale v. Marcus Cable Associates, LLC (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 344, 351–352.“On receipt of a response to requests for admissions, the party requesting admissions may move for an order compelling a further response if that party deems that either or both of the following apply: ¶ (1) An answer to a particular request is evasive or incomplete. ¶ (2) An objection to a particular request is without merit or too general.” Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (a).DISCUSSIONA. TimelinessThe motions must be brought within 45 days of service of the verified response, supplemental verified response, or on a date to which the propounding and responding parties have agreed to in writing; otherwise, the propounding party waives the right to compel further responses. Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (c); 2031.310, subd. (c); 2033.290, subd. (c); but see Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 134-136 (suggesting that the 45-day deadline does not apply to objections-only responses). “[T]he time within which to make a motion to compel production of documents is mandatory and jurisdictional just as it is for motions to compel further answers to interrogatories.” Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410. The 45-day deadline “is ‘jurisdictional’ in the sense that it renders the court without authority to rule on motions to compel other than to deny them.” Ibid.The motions are timely since they were filed on February 20, 2024, within 45 days of January 2, 2024, when Plaintiff served the discovery responses at issue. FROG Motion, Agege Decl., ¶ 3; SROG Motion, Agege Decl., ¶ 3; RPD Motion, Agege Decl., ¶ 3; RFA Motion, Agege Decl., ¶ 3.B. Meet and ConferThe instant motions to compel further responses must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b)(1); 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).Here, VOTS has satisfied the meet and confer requirement for each motion. Defense counsel testifies that he sent a meet and confer letter to Plaintiff, but Plaintiff did not respond. FROG Motion, Agege Decl., ¶ 4; SROG Motion, Agege Decl., ¶ r; RPD Motion, Agege Decl., ¶ 4; RFA Motion, Agege Decl., ¶ 4.C. Separate StatementThe motions must be accompanied by a separate statement. Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a)(1), (2), (3), and (5). “A separate statement is a separate document filed and served with the discovery motion that provides all the information necessary to understand each discovery request and all the responses to it that are at issue. The separate statement must be full and complete so that no person is required to review any other document in order to determine the full request and the full response. Material must not be incorporated into the separate statement by reference.” Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(c).Here, VOTS has satisfied the separate statement requirement of each motion.D. The Discovery Requests at IssueAccording to the separate statements, VOTS moves to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to RPDs Nos. 1 through 25, RFAs Nos. 1 through 39, SROG Nos. 1 through 52 (Plaintiff points out that VOTS did not provide any response to SROG No. 40), and FROG Nos., 1.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 4.1, 4.2, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 9.1, 9.2, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 12.7, 13.1, 13.2, 14.1, 14.2, 17.1, 50.1, 50.2, 50.3, 50.4, 50.5, and 50.6.Plaintiff has not filed any opposition to the motions, disputing VOTS argument that it refused to meet and confer with VOTS or arguing that it later supplemented its responses. Nevertheless, “[t]he failure to file a written opposition [to a motion to compel discovery] … shall not be deemed an admission that the motion was proper or that sanctions should be awarded.” Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(b).The court has reviewed the separate statements and agrees with VOTS that Plaintiff does not show that it attempted to respond to the authorized discovery methods in good faith. Specifically, most of the objections to the discovery were meritless. For example, RFA No. 3 asked Plaintiff: “Admit that there is no storage contract between YOU and Propounding Party.” RFA Separate Statement, p. 4:6-7. Plaintiff objected to that RFA, arguing that it calls for information protected by the attorney-client privilege and work-product doctrine; it seeks information not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence (even though the RFA seeks relevant information based on the 4AC’s allegations); it is vague as to time (even though the RFA does not need to be narrowed to a specific time period); and it is burdensome/oppressive (even though Plaintiff alleges that this action arises from VOTS alleged breach of an alleged storage contract). Plaintiff also responded to the RFA and other discovery requests, saying that: “Responding Party has not completed his investigation of facts and documents, his discovery, or his preparation for trial.” However, as VOTS argues in its separate statements and pointed out in its meet and confer letter, by using pronouns such as “his” (or “her” in other discovery responses) instead of “it” to describe Plaintiff, an entity, the responsessuggest that Plaintiff simply cut and pasted the objections from another set of discovery responses.Accordingly, the request to compel Plaintiff’s further responses to the discovery requests at issue is GRANTED.E. Requests for SanctionsIn each of the four motions, VOTS seeks monetary sanctions. Specifically, VOTS seeks sanctions of $3,310 per motion for the RPD and FROG motions. That amount consists of 3 hours counsel spent on the moving papers, 2 hours counsel anticipated spending on the reply and appearing at the hearing, a total of 5 hours at counsel’s billing rate of $650 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee. FROG Motion, Agege Decl. ¶ 6; RPD Motion, Agege Decl., ¶ 6. For the RFA and SROG motions, VOTS seeks sanctions of $3,960 per motion. That amount consists of 4 hours counsel spent on the moving papers, 2 hours he anticipated to draft the reply and attend the hearing, a total of 6 hours multiplied by his billing rate of $650 per hour, and a $60 filing fee. RFA Motion, Agege Decl., ¶ 6; SROG Motion, Agege Decl., ¶ 6.The court finds it proper to impose sanctions given Plaintiff’s deficient responses. Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (d); 2031.310, subd. (h); 2033.290, subd. (d).However, the court finds the requested sanctions excessive since no reply (or opposition) papers were filed. The court also finds a billing rate of $650 per hour excessive for these routine motions.Therefore, the court imposes sanctions of $2,840 total (five hours of attorney time at $500/hr and four filing fees) against Plaintiff.CONCLUSIONThe request to compel plaintiff Aries Global Logistics, Inc.’s further responses to defendant Valley of the Sun Cosmetics, LLC’s Form Interrogatories (Set One), Request for Production of Documents (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Request for Admission (Set One) is GRANTED. The plaintiff is ordered to serve further responses to those discovery requests within 30 days of this ruling.The request for sanctions is granted. Plaintiff Aries Global Logistics, Inc. is ordered to pay defendant Valley of the Sun Cosmetics, LLC sanctions of $2,840.Moving party is ordered to give notice.
