And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 23STCV11541, which concerns a motion to compel Defendant Jorge Carlos Castro's deposition and seek monetary sanctions. The judge has denied the motion to compel, finding that Defendant has served timely objections and has now agreed to appear for an in-person deposition on August 13, 2024. The judge has also declined to award monetary sanctions to Defendant, as he has not shown a statutory basis for the sanctions under California Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450. The judge orders that Plaintiff shall provide notice of the ruling and file a proof of service of such.
