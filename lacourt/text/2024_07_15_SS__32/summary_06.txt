The Defendant is also seeking monetary sanctions against the Plaintiffs and their counsel.

The Court finds that the Plaintiffs failed to serve timely responses to the Defendant's discovery requests and that sanctions are warranted. However, the Court reduces the amount of sanctions requested by the Defendant from $1,250 to $1,120 for each motion.

The Court grants the Defendant's motions to compel responses and awards sanctions in the amount of $1,120 against Plaintiff Tiffany Cruz and her counsel, and $1,120 against Plaintiff Ryan Cruz and his counsel. The Defendant is ordered to provide notice of the Court's order and file a proof of service of such.
