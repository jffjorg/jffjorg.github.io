And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is for Case Number 22STCV40016, a lawsuit filed by Joseph Buddenberg against Enedino Espinoza and others. The lawsuit alleges that Espinoza, a security guard, physically attacked and assaulted Buddenberg on October 18, 2022, while Buddenberg was exiting a premises in Los Angeles.

The court has considered Espinoza's demurrer to the third cause of action, which alleges intentional infliction of emotional distress. The court finds that the pleadings are not so uncertain that Espinoza cannot reasonably respond, and overrules the demurrer.

The court has also considered Espinoza's motion to strike punitive damages, which alleges that the damages are not warranted. The court denies the motion, finding that the complaint states a prima facie claim for punitive damages.

The court orders that Espinoza provide notice of the ruling and file a proof of service of such. The court also grants leave to amend the complaint if necessary.
