  to Substitute 




MOVING PARTIES


Plaintiff
  Kane Anthony Leyva 




OPPOSING PARTY


Defendant
  Lyft, Inc. 



 
BACKGROUND
 
On December 20,
2021, Plaintiff Anthony Leyva (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Lyft, Inc., Umijon Doe, and Does 1 to 100 for assault, battery, and
negligence that occurred on January 2, 2020.¿¿ 
 
Plaintiff passed
away on February 24, 2021, prior to filing this action. (See Min. Order,
9/12/23.) 
 
On September 12,
2023, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion to substitute the Estate of Anthony
Leyva for Plaintiff and appoint Plaintiff’s minor son, Kane Anthony Leyva as
successor in interest under Code of Civil Procedure section 377.31. (Min. Order, 9/12/23.) 
 
On April 22, 2024, the Court denied
Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend the complaint. (Min. Order,
4/22/24.) 
 
“Plaintiff” Kane Anthony Leyva now moves to be substituted as
Plaintiff under Code of Civil Procedure section 377.31.[1] Defendant
Lyft, Inc. (“Defendant”) opposes. No reply has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
California Code of Civil Procedure
section 377.31 provides that the decedent’s personal representative or, if
none, the decedent’s successor in interest may continue a decedent’s pending
action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.30; see Adams v. Superior Court (2011)
196 Cal.App.4th 71, 78-79.) A successor in interest is the beneficiary of the
decedent’s estate or other successor in interest who succeeds to a cause of
action or to a particular item of the property that is the subject of the cause
of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 377.11.) Section 377.33 provides that the court
in which an action is continued may make any order concerning parties that is
appropriate to ensure proper administration of justice, including the
appointment of the decedent’s successor in interest as a special administrator
or guardian ad litem.  
 
Section 377.32 provides that a
person who seeks to commence such an action as the decedent’s successor in
interest must file an affidavit or declaration providing certain information,
including the decedent’s name, date and place of decedent’s death, and
statements regarding whether the estate has been administered and that the
affiant or declarant is the successor in interest on decedent’s claim. (Id.,
§ 377.32(a).) A certified copy of the decedent’s death certificate must also be
attached to the affidavit or declaration. (Id., § 377.32(c).)
 
DISCUSSION
 
As an initial matter, this motion is labeled a motion to substitute a
successor in interest and “Plaintiff requests pursuant to the provisions of
Code of Civil Procedure § 377.31 on the grounds that Plaintiff passed away on
February 24, 2021.” (Notice of Motion at p. 2.) However, as the Court
previously explained in its September 12, 2023 order, Plaintiff has not
provided any authority that the Court may substitute a successor in interest
pursuant to section 377.31 where the Plaintiff died before the complaint was
filed. Section 377.31 provides in part that “[o]n motion after the death of a
person who commenced an action or proceeding…” Here, the person who commenced
the action was already deceased.
 
The notice of motion also requests that the Court grant “leave to
amend the Complaint to convert the complaint to a survival action.” (Notice of
Motion at p. 1.) In the body of the motion, counsel argues “[t]his is not a
motion to amend the complaint, per se, as was brought before this Court
previously. This motion is brought under the proper C.C.P. sections that permit
a successor in interest to substitute himself for a decease [sic] plaintiff.”
(Motion at p. 4.) Counsel then argues that this is a “renewed motion” pursuant
to section 1008(b) presents some facts that were missing from the original
motion. (Id.)
 
Even if the Court were to consider this a motion to renew, Plaintiff
fails to show diligence with a satisfactory explanation for not presenting new
information earlier. Code of Civil Procedure section 1008 provides, in pertinent
part:¿
 
“(b) A party who originally made an application for an
order which was refused in whole or in part, or granted conditionally or on
terms, may make a subsequent application for the same order upon new or
different facts, circumstances, or law, in which case it shall be shown by
affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what order
or decisions were made, and what new or different facts circumstances, or law
are claimed to be shown. For a failure to comply with this subdivision, any order
made on a subsequent application may be revoked or set aside on an ex parte
motion.”
¿¿ 
However,
the burden under Section 1008 “is comparable to that of a party seeking a new
trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence: the information must be such
that the moving party could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered or
produced it at the trial.” (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005)
135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212-13; Even Zohar Construction & Remodeling,
Inc. v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 830, 833 [finding that
Section 1008 imposes the special requirement of having to not only show new or
different facts, circumstances, or law, but also to “show diligence with a
satisfactory explanation for not presenting the new or different information
earlier…”].)¿¿
 
Here,
Plaintiff’s counsel declares the following relevant facts:
 
“This matter was filed on December 5,
2021. Counsel for Plaintiff, given the ongoing pandemic, realized on or about
January 2, 2021 that communication with Mr. Leyva had been lost. Counsel made
attempts to locate Mr. Leyva. On or about April 8, 2022, counsel for Plaintiff
learned of Mr. Leyva’s death on February 24, 2021. (4) The request was not made
earlier because counsel had difficulty locating decedent’s next of kin.
Decedent was divorced. Mr. Leyva’s parents were located and they advised that
decedent had a son.” 
(Hakim Decl. ¶ 5.) 
 
            Here, the
request for renewed motion for leave to amend is denied because Plaintiff fails
to meet his burden that this evidence could not be provided with reasonable
diligence during the original motion. 
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court DENIES the motion to substitute.
 
The Court advances and vacates the Orders to Show Cause set for August
15, 2024, and sets an Order to Show Cause re Dismissal pursuant to CCP §
583.410 for September 9, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. Any responsive papers must be filed
at least 5 days in advance.
 
Moving Party shall give notice of the Court’s orders, and file a proof
of service of such.
