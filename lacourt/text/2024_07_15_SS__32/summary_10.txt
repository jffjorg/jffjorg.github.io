And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by the defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, to deem admitted requests for admission, compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and a request for production. The defendant served these requests on the plaintiff, Robert Frausto Acevedo, on September 11, 2023, but the plaintiff failed to respond. The court has denied the motion as procedurally defective because the plaintiff's counsel was relieved effective upon filing proof of service of the final order, but the proof of service was not filed. The court has also denied the motions to compel without prejudice. The defendant is required to provide notice of the court's order and file a proof of service of such.
