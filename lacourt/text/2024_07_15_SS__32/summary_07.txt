And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is denying the motion to appoint Dorothy Ugorji as the successor in interest to the deceased plaintiff, Chinenye Prince Ugorji. The motion was filed on behalf of the plaintiff's sister, Dorothy Ugorji, who seeks to continue the plaintiff's action against Defendants Housing Partnership Network, Inc. and 6218 Compton LLC. The Judge finds that the motion is not time-barred, as the plaintiff died after filing the action, but notes that the Plaintiff's death certificate has not been attached to the declarations in the motion, as required by law. The Judge also finds that Dorothy Ugorji has not sufficiently responded to Defendants' argument that she is not a surviving spouse or surviving child. As a result, the motion is denied without prejudice.
