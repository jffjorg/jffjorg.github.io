BACKGROUND
 
 Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority  (“Defendant”) now
moves for an order to deem admitted Requests for Admission, Set One and to
compel verified responses to Form Interrogatories,
Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Production,
Set One propounded on Plaintiff Robert Frausto Acevedo (“Plaintiff”). No
opposition has been filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Requests
for Admission
 
Where there has
been no timely response to a request for admission under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.¿ (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)¿ The party who failed to respond waives any
objections to the demand, unless the court grants that party relief from the
waiver, upon a showing that the party (1) has subsequently served a
substantially compliant response, and (2) that the party’s failure to respond
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.¿ (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subds. (a)(1)-(2).)¿ The court “shall” grant a motion to
deem admitted requests for admissions, “unless it finds that the party to whom
the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on
the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in
substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”¿ (Code of Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (c).)¿ 
 
Where a party
fails to provide a timely response to requests for admission, “[i]t is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
Interrogatories
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
responses. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.290 (b).) Failure to timely respond waives
all objections, including privilege and work product, unless “[t]he party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance” and “[t]he
party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290 (a)(1),
(a)(2).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no
responses have been served and no meet and confer is required when a party does
not respond to discovery requests. All that need be shown in the moving papers
is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party,
that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been
served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902,
905-906.)  
 
If a motion to
compel responses is filed, the Court shall impose a monetary sanction against
the losing party “unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290 (c).) Further, “[t]he
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1348(a). 
 
Requests for Production 
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure Section 2031.300, if a party
fails to serve a timely response to a demand for inspection, the party making
the demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Code Civ.
Pro § 2031.300 (b).) The party who fails to serve a timely response to a demand
for inspection waives any objection to the demand unless the court finds that
the party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance
or party’s failure was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300 (a)(1)- (2).)  
 
Courts shall impose a monetary sanction against any party
who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand
for inspection unless the party acted with substantial justification or other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.300 (c).) Further, “[t]he court may award sanctions under the Discovery
Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1348(a).) 
 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Here, Defendant asserts that it served Requests for
Admission, Set One, Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set
One, and Request for Production, Set One on
Plaintiff’s counsel, Albert Abkarian, on September 11, 2023. (Pluma Decl. ¶ 3,
Exh. A.) Defendant granted an extension until December 11, 2023. No responses
were served. 
 
On March 27, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s
(Albert Abkarian) motion to be relieved effective upon filing proof of service
of the final order.[1] (Min. Order, 3/27/24.) The order was signed on April 3,
2024. However, no proof of service of the Order appears in the Court’s docket. 
 
Defendant does not address this procedural history in the
motion but has served notice of the motions by mail on Plaintiff’s address
provided in the Order. 
 
Plaintiff has not responded and has not filed an opposition
to this motion. (Pluma Decl. ¶ 5.) However, because Plaintiff’s counsel has not
served the proof of service of the Order Relieving Counsel, the Court concludes
that Albert Abkarian is still the counsel of record for Plaintiff, and
therefore needed notice of the instant motions. 
 
Therefore, the motion to deem admitted and motions to
compel are denied as procedurally defective.   
 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to establish Request for
Admissions, Set One admitted is denied without prejudice. Defendant’s Motions
to Compel Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One,
and Request for Production, Set One are DENIED without
prejudice. 
  
Defendant shall
provide notice of the Court’s order and file a proof of service of such.
