BACKGROUND
 
On March 5, 2019, Plaintiffs Matthew Newells, Tevye Nguyen, Taviere
N., and Matthew N. filed a complaint in Los Angeles Superior Court against
Defendants County of Los Angeles, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department,
Unidentified Deputies, and Does 1 to 100 for negligence, wrongful death, and a
violation of Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment (42 U.S.C. § 1983).
 
On September 27, 2019, the case was removed to federal court. (Notice
of Removal to Federal Court, filed 10/1/19.)
 
While in federal court, Plaintiffs filed the operative second amended
complaint (“SAC”) alleging the same causes of action. (See Plaintiffs’ Appendix
of Federal Court Filings Prior to Remand, Volume 4, 1758–1778, filed 6/8/23.) Judge
Fernando L. Aenlle-Rocha granted summary judgment as to the third cause of
action for a violation of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. (See
Plaintiffs’ Appendix of Federal Court Filings Prior to Remand, Volume 6,
2747–2764, filed 6/8/23.) On July 20, 2022, the Federal Court declined to
exercise supplemental jurisdiction, and the case was remanded to the Los
Angeles Superior Court. (See Plaintiffs’ Appendix of Federal Court Filings
Prior to Remand, Volume 6, 2782–2785, filed 6/8/23.)
 
On April 4, 2024, the Court granted Defendants County of Los Angeles
(erroneously sued as Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department), and Deputies
Hanley and Warner’s (collectively, “Defendants”) motion for summary judgment. 
 
On April 29, 2024, the case was called for trial and there were no
appearances. The Court then entered the following order: “The Court orders
Doe(s), all, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and Unidentified Deputies
in Amended Complaint (1st) filed by Matthew Newells, et al. on 08/29/2019
dismissed without prejudice. This dismissal is pursuant to CCP 581 (b)(3).”
(Min. Order, 4/29/24.) 
 
Defendants now move under Code of Civil Procedure section
116.725(a)(2), to correct the error in the April 29, 2024 minute order.
Defendants argue the minute order is incorrect since the first amended
complaint is not the operative complaint in this case. No opposition has been
filed. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 116.725 states the following in
relevant part:
 
“(a)
A motion to correct a clerical error in a judgment or to set aside and vacate a
judgment on the ground of an incorrect or erroneous legal basis for the
decision may be made as follows:
 
(1) By the court on its own motion at any time.
(2) By a party within 30 days after the clerk mails notice of entry of
judgment to the        parties.” 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Based on the procedural history of this case, the Court concludes that
the second amended complaint, originally filed while this case was pending in
federal court is the operative pleading. Accordingly, the Court vacates the April
29, 2024 order and sets aside the dismissal as to Los Angeles County Sheriff’s
Department and Unidentified Deputies in the First Amended Complaint.
 
However, the Second Amended Complaint alleged Does 1 through 10. No
Does have been named or served. At the hearing on this motion, Plaintiffs shall
confirm that they are moving to dismiss Does.
