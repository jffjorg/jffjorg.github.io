MOTION
 
On December 23, 2022, Plaintiff Joseph Buddenberg (“Plaintiff”) filed
a complaint against Defendants Target Corporation, Allied Universal, John Doe,
and Does 1 to 50 for various causes of action including, assault, battery, and
intentional infliction of emotional distress. Plaintiff alleges that on October
18, 2022, he was exiting the premises at 735 S. Figueroa St. Los Angeles, when
John Doe, a security guard, physically attacked and assaulted him. (Complaint ¶
8.) 
 
On March 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed an amendment to the complaint,
substituting Enedino Espinoza as John Doe. 
 
Defendant Enedino Espinoza (“Defendant”) now demurs to the third cause
of action in the complaint for intentional infliction of emotional distress
arguing it is uncertain and fails to state a cause of action. Defendant also
separately moves to strike Plaintiff’s punitive damages claim in the first and
second causes of action. Plaintiff opposes and Defendant replies. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
A demurrer is a pleading used to
test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. 
It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the
opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or cross-complaint).  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 422.10, 589; see Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  It is not the function of the demurrer to
challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on
the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true.  (Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.)
 
The general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege
ultimate facts, not evidentiary facts. (Doe v. City of Los Angeles
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) “All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter
of pleading, even as against a special demurrer, is that his complaint set
forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable precision and with
sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source and
extent of his cause of action.” (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp. (1945) 26 Cal.2d 149,
156-157.) 
 
On demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to
“determine whether or not the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a
cause of action under any legal theory.” (Das v. Bank of America, N.A.
(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.) Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of
causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose of an
entire cause of action to be sustained.” (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.)
 
A
demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the pleading is so bad
that the responding party cannot reasonably respond, i.e., he or she cannot
reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what claims are
directed against him or her. (Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Where a demurrer is made upon the ground of uncertainty,
the demurrer must distinctly specify exactly how or why the pleading is
uncertain, and where such uncertainty appears by reference to page and line
numbers. (See Fenton v. Groveland Comm. Services Dist. (1982) 135
Cal.App.3d 797, 809.)
 
            Where a demurrer is sustained, leave
to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976)
18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a
pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).  
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the
responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).)
Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing
their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3).)
 
According to the Declaration of Loni
K. Harada-Orosz, Defendant’s counsel met by telephone with Plaintiff’s counsel
and sent a meet and confer letter in April 2024 regarding this demurrer.
(Harada-Orosz Decl. ¶ 5–6.) Therefore, the meet and confer requirement is met.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
As an initial matter, upon reviewing the complaint, the Court finds that
the pleadings are not so uncertain that Defendant cannot reasonably respond.
Therefore, the Court will address the argument that the intentional infliction
of emotional distress cause of action does not state sufficient facts. 
 
The elements for
a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) are
(1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of
causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional
distress; (2) the plaintiff’s suffering severe or extreme emotional distress;
and (3) an actual and proximate causal link between the tortious conduct and
the emotional distress.¿ (Hughes v. Pair (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1050.)¿¿ 
 
“The tort calls
for intentional, or at least reckless conduct—conduct intended to inflict
injury or engaged in with the realization that injury will result.” (Davidson v. City of Westminster (1982) 32 Cal.3d
197, 210.) “It is not enough that the conduct be intentional and
outrageous. It must be conduct directed at the plaintiff, or occur in the
presence of a plaintiff of whom the defendant is aware.” (Christensen v. Superior Court (1991) 54 Cal.3d 868, 903.)
“A defendant’s conduct is outrageous when it is so extreme as to exceed all
bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.” (Jackson v.
Mayweather (2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 234, 257 (internal citations and
quotations omitted).) “Mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty
oppressions, or other trivialities do not constitute extreme and outrageous
conduct.” (Okorie v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2017) 14
Cal.App.5th 574, 597 (internal citations and quotations omitted).) Rather, the
requirements for satisfying the element of extreme and outrageous conduct are
rigorous and difficult to satisfy. (Okorie, supra, 14 Cal.App.5th
at 597.) “On the spectrum of offensive conduct, outrageous conduct is that
which is the most extremely offensive.” (Id.) (quoting Yurick v.
Superior Court (1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 1116, 1129).) “Depending on the
idiosyncrasies of the plaintiff, offensive conduct which falls along the
remainder of the spectrum may be irritating, insulting or even distressing but
it is not actionable and must simply be endured without resort to legal
redress.” (Ibid.) “In order to avoid a demurrer, the plaintiff must
allege with ‘great[ ] specificity’ the acts which he or she believes are so extreme
as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.” (Vasquez
v. Franklin Management Real Estate Fund, Inc. (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 819,
832.) 
 
            Here, the complaint alleges the
following: 
 
“As
Plaintiff was exiting the subject premises and using his cellphone, he was
approached and questioned by Defendant JOHN DOE. Defendant JOHN DOE, suddenly
and without warning, physically attacked and assaulted Plaintiff with such
force that Plaintiff suffered injuries and damages. The force of Defendant JOHN
DOE'S assault to Plaintiff's body caused Plaintiff to suffer physical injuries
and damages.” (Complaint ¶¶ 8–9.) Plaintiff also describes the incident as the
following: “Defendant JOHN DOE aggressively approached the Plaintiff, leaning
forward and getting within inches of his person, and in a loud bellicose manner
threatened to touch and/or grab Plaintiff in a harmful manner such that it
reasonably appeared that Defendant JOHN DOE was about to carry out the threat.”
(Id. ¶ 15.) 
 
            The complaint further alleges:
 
“Defendant JOHN DOE acted with the intention of
causing or reckless disregard of the probability of causing emotional distress
when Defendant JOHN DOE, suddenly and without warning, physically attacked and
assaulted Plaintiff with such force that plaintiff suffered injuries and
damages. Defendant JOHN DOE'S conduct as set forth above was so outrageous as
to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated by a civilized community. As a
result of Defendant JOHN DOE's socially unacceptable conduct set forth above the
Plaintiff has suffered severe and extreme emotional distress including, but not
limited to, highly unpleasant mental suffering and anguish that entails such
intense, enduring and nontrivial emotional distress that no reasonable person
in a civilized society would be expected to endure.” 
(Complaint ¶¶ 27–29.) 
 
The
complaint alleges a physical attack of such force that it caused physical
injury. The complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of action for intentional
infliction of emotional distress. Accordingly, the Court overrules the
demurrer.
 
Motion
to Strike
 
California law authorizes a party’s motion to strike matter from an
opposing party’s pleading if it is irrelevant, false, or improper. (Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 435; 436(a).) Motions may also target pleadings or parts of pleadings
which are not filed or drawn in conformity with applicable laws, rules or
orders. (Code Civ. Proc. § 436(b).) A motion to strike is used to address
defects that appear on the face of a pleading or from judicially noticed matter
but that are not grounds for a demurrer. (Pierson v Sharp Memorial Hospital
(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 340, 342.)
 
Punitive damages may be imposed where it is proven by clear and
convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or
malice. (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a).) “Malice” is conduct intended by the
defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is
carried on with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of
others. (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(1).) “‘Punitive damages are proper only
when the tortious conduct rises to levels of extreme indifference to the
plaintiff’s rights, a level which decent citizens should not have to tolerate.’
[Citation.]” (Lackner v. North (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1188, 1210.)
 
“As amended to include [despicable], the [Civil Code section 3294]
plainly indicates that absent an intent to injure the plaintiff, ‘malice’
requires more than a ‘willful and conscious’ disregard of the plaintiffs’
interests. The additional component of ‘despicable conduct’ must be found.” (College
Hospital Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 725.) (emphasis
added.) The statute’s reference to despicable conduct represents a “new
substantive limitation on punitive damage awards.” (Ibid.) Despicable conduct
is “conduct which is so vile, base, contemptible, miserable, wretched or
loathsome that it would be looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent
people. Such conduct has been described as ‘having the character of outrage
frequently associated with crime.’” (Tomaselli v. Transamerica Ins. Co.
(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1269, 1287.) Further, “[t]here must be evidence that
defendant acted with knowledge of the probable dangerous consequences to
plaintiff’s interests and deliberately failed to avoid these consequences.” (Flyer’s
Body Shop Profit Sharing Plan v. Ticor Title Ins. Co. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d
1149, 1155.)
 
A motion to strike punitive damages is properly granted where a
plaintiff does not state a prima facie claim for punitive damages, including
allegations that defendant is guilty of oppression, fraud or malice. (Turman
v. Turning Point of Cent. California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.)
“Mere negligence, even gross negligence, is not sufficient to justify such an
award” for punitive damages. (Kendall Yacht Corp. v. United California Bank
(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 949, 958.) Moreover, conclusory allegations are not
sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages. (Brousseau v. Jarrett
(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 864, 872.) Lastly, “[t]he mere allegation an intentional tort was committed
is not sufficient to warrant an award of punitive damages.  Not only must
there be circumstances of oppression, fraud, or malice, but facts must be
alleged in the pleading to support such a claim.” (Grieves v. Superior Court
(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 166.) 
 
The
complaint alleges a physical attack of such force that it caused physical
injury. The complaint states a prima facie claim for punitive damages. The
motion to strike is denied.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court overrules Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s third
cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Court denies
Defendant’s motion to strike with leave to amend. 
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
