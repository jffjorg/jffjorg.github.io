Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The plaintiff, Studio Estates, LLC, moves to enter judgment against the defendants, Nine Eleven Movie, LLC, Martin Sprock, and Sprockefeller Pictures, LLC, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The parties agreed in writing to settle the case, and the settlement agreement provides for the payment of $360,000. The defendants argue that the plaintiff waived the right to the payment by continuing to discuss the investment option after the deadline. However, the court finds that the plaintiff's sole discretion to redirect the payment as an investment in the film Big Finish does not constitute a waiver of the right to the payment. The court grants the plaintiff's motion for entry of judgment in the amount of $360,000, plus prejudgment interest. The court will modify the proposed judgment to strike unnecessary provisions and enter judgment as modified."
