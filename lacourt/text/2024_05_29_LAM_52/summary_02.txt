And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling by the judge lifts the stay pending appeal in the case of Antonietta Violante v. Shippers Transport Express, Inc. and Kevin Baddeley. The stay was ordered pending appeal of the court's decision to grant plaintiff's motion to withdraw from arbitration. The court found that the amendment to Code of Civil Procedure section 1294(a) allows courts to lift the stay pending appeal and prevent corporations from using delay tactics. The court granted plaintiff's motion to withdraw from arbitration because defendant materially breached the arbitration agreement. The court finds good cause to lift the stay and allows the proceedings to continue.
