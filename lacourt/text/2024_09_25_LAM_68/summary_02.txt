And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to the request for production of documents. The plaintiff had requested that the defendant provide additional responses to certain document requests, citing that the defendant's previous responses were not code compliant. The defendant had filed an opposition to the motion, stating that it had already provided the requested documents and would continue to provide them. The judge found that the defendant had agreed to produce non-privileged documents, which rendered the dispute moot. The judge also noted that the plaintiff had not provided a valid request for sanctions and declined to impose sanctions. The trial date is currently set for July 28, 2025.
