Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories by Defendant O'Neil & Matusek. The motion seeks to compel Plaintiff Jerry Kohn to provide further responses to interrogatories regarding the case initiated by Plaintiff. The court finds that the motion presents a sufficient meet and confer effort and response, and that the objections lack merit. The court grants the motion and orders Plaintiff to serve amended, verified responses within 15 days.

The court also notes that Plaintiff's conduct in this case has been characterized as "obnoxious semantic gamesmanship, and layers of intransigent obstruction" and that Plaintiff has failed to provide substantive responses to the interrogatories. The court warns that further non-compliance may lead to a motion to impose sanctions, including monetary and terminating sanctions.

The judge also notes that the Plaintiff is self-represented and cannot recover sanctions, and therefore denies the request for sanctions. The case is set for further hearings on March 27, April 2, 3, and 7, 2025.
