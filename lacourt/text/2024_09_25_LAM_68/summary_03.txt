The court finds that the totality of the circumstances, including the vast majority of defendants, location of the property, identified third party witnesses, multiple actions, potential for claim splitting, and potential dismissal of the subject action on grounds of abatement, supports a finding for granting the motion to transfer the action to San Bernardino Superior Court.
```
Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion to transfer the action to the San Bernardino Superior Court. The motion was filed by specially appearing defendant Raymond Noda, who argued that the subject action involves a property located in Barstow, and the majority of the witnesses reside in San Bernardino County. The court found that the convenience of witnesses, including third-party disinterested witnesses, outweighs the inconvenience of Noda appearing in San Bernardino. The court also noted that the multiple actions pending between the same parties on the same cause of action raises concerns of forum shopping and claim splitting. The court concludes that the totality of the circumstances supports a finding for granting the motion to transfer the action to San Bernardino Superior Court.
