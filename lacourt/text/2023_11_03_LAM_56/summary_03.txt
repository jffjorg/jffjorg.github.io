And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants, Maguire Properties – 777 Tower, LLC, et al. The Judge has considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers and has granted the defendants' request for judicial notice of certain documents.

The Judge has ruled that the Complaint states facts sufficient to support a cause of action against the Brookfield Defendants, despite their arguments that the Complaint fails to state facts sufficient to support a cause of action against them. The Judge found that the alter ego allegations in the Complaint are sufficient to survive demurrer.

The Judge has also ruled that the Complaint states facts sufficient to support a cause of action for foreclosure of mechanic's lien, despite the defendants' arguments that the Complaint fails to state facts that Plaintiff served Defendants with the requisite preliminary lien notices.

The Judge has denied the motion to strike the Complaint, finding that the alter ego allegations are relevant and sufficient to support a cause of action.

The Judge has ordered that the demurrer be overruled and the motion to strike be denied. The parties are required to give notice of this ruling.
