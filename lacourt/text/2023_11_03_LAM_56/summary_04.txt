And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Hon. Holly J. Fujie in the case of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association v. Scott Schamber. The case involves a claim of exemption by Defendant Scott Schamber for his Chase bank savings account, which is subject to a judgment of $64,320.40. The Defendant claims that the funds in the account are exempt because they come from the sale of a homestead and funds received from a personal injury case for damages. However, the Plaintiff disputes the amount of homestead proceeds and when they were obtained, as well as the amount of damages awarded from the personal injury case. The Court finds that the Defendant has not provided sufficient evidence to support his claim of exemption and therefore denies the claim unless the Defendant provides competent evidence at the hearing establishing the exemption.
