            The Court has considered the moving
papers. 
 
BACKGROUND
             On November 26, 2018, Plaintiff Jie Liu
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Hongqiang Zhou (“Defendant”), alleging
causes of action for: (1) breach of contract; (2) unjust enrichment; (3) breach
of fiduciary duty; (4) fraud – deceit; (5) fraud – intentional
misrepresentation; (6) negligent misrepresentation. 
            On October 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to enforce civil subpoena against Defendant. On October 25,
2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Non-Opposition. 
 
MEET AND CONFER 
             Plaintiff has fulfilled the meet and confer
requirement for this motion. 
 
DISCUSSION
            A deposition subpoena may command
only the production of business records without attendance at a deposition from
a nonparty. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.020, subd. (b).) A deposition subpoena
that requires only the production of documents “shall designate the business
records to be produced either by specifically describing each individual item
or by reasonably particularizing each category of item…” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2020.410, subd. (a).) A deposition subpoena for the production of business
documents need not be accompanied by an affidavit of good cause and must be
directed at the custodian of records or other person qualified to certify those
documents. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.410, subd. (c).) The responding party must
comply with a deposition subpoena on a date that is no earlier than 20 days
after the issuance or 15 days after service of the subpoena, whichever is
later. (Id.)  
 
If
a deponent fails to produce the requested documents, the party seeking
discovery may move for an order compelling that answer or production. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (a).) This motion must be made no later than 60
days after the “completion of the deposition” and must be accompanied by a meet
and confer declaration under Section 2016,040. (Code Civ. Proc., subd. (b).)
“…[T]he 60 day period during which a motion to compel must be filed, begins to
run when the deponent serves objections on the party. At the time the
objections are served, the record of deposition is complete.” (Board of
Registered Nursing v. Superior Court (2021) 59 Cal.App.5th 1011,
1032.)   
 
Plaintiff
moves to enforce the civil subpoena against Defendant after Defendant failed to
produce documents in compliance with the subpoena due on September 15, 2023. 
 
On December 21, 2022, Plaintiff’s
counsel issued a Civil Subpoena (the “Subpoena”) for personal appearance and
production of documents to Defendant, requesting Defendant to appear and
produce documents on February 23, 2023, at this Court. (Tu Decl. ¶7.) On
January 6, 2023, Registered Process Server Jeremy Langdon personally served the
subpoena on Defendant. (Id. at ¶8.) On January 10, 2023, Plaintiff applied for a
writ of execution for Los Angeles County. (Id. at ¶ 9.) The Court
issued the writ of execution on January 12, 2023. (Id. at ¶10.) On February 23, 2023, the
Court issued an order continuing the Debtor Examination to April 27, 2023, and
instructed Defendant to bring the requested documents on the date of
examination. (Id. at ¶12.) 
 
On March 8, 2023, Plaintiff received a Claim of Exemption from the
Sheriff, which was filed by Xue Li Zeng, Defendant’s spouse. (Id. at
¶13.) On April 27, 2023, the Court further continued the Debtor Examination to
July 7, 2023, and set a deadline of May 31, 2023, for Defendant to provide the
documents without objections to Plaintiff in compliance with the Subpoena. (Id.
at ¶14.) On May 4, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s opposition to Zeng’s
Claim of Exemption. (Id. at ¶15.) The Court ordered the Debtor’s
Examination continued to August 24, 2023, and on August 24, 2023, the Court
ordered Defendant to produce documents in compliance with the Subpoena by
September 15, 2023. (Id. at ¶16, 18.)  As of this date, Plaintiff argues that
Defendant has not produced any documents, ESI, or items requested by the
Subpoena and did not provide any responses to the Subpoena. 
 
The Court finds that Defendant has
failed to comply with its discovery obligation. The production date for the
Subpoena at issue was September 15, 2023. (Tu Decl. ¶ 18.) Defendant produced no documents on the production date. Additionally,
Defendant has failed to file an opposition and explain to the Court why it
failed to provide the requested documents or a response on the production date.
As
such, the Court orders Defendant to comply with Plaintiff’s Subpoena.
 
Sanctions 
Pursuant to Section 2025.480, subdivision (j), “[t]he court
shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7…against any party, person,
or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel an answer or
production, unless it finds the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.” (Emphasis added.) Section 2025.480 applies to nonparties. (See
Board of Registered Nursing v. Superior Court of Orange County (2021) 59
Cal.App.5th 1011, 1031.)  
 
            Plaintiff
seeks monetary sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $3,661.65.
Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly billing rate is $450.00 per hour. (Tu Decl. ¶20.)
Plaintiff’s counsel claims to have spent (5) five hours preparing this motion
and anticipates spending (2) hours to review Defendant’s opposition and prepare
a reply to the opposition and (1) one hour to attend the hearing on this motion
and filing costs of $61.65. (Id. at ¶21-22.) However, no opposition
is filed so a reduction of sanctions for Plaintiff’s counsel is warranted. The
reward is reduced by 6 hours or $2,700.00. Thus, Plaintiff is entitled to
monetary sanctions in the reduced total amount of $2,761.65.
 
Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion to enforce civil subpoena.
 
            Monetary sanctions are awarded to
Plaintiff against Defendant in the reduced total amount of $2,761.65. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
            
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
