RESPONDING PARTY: None

No opposition has been filed. 
 


 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises from a transaction
pertaining to the real property located at 10062 Hillgrove Drive in Beverly
Hills, California (the “Subject Property”). On August 25, 2023, plaintiffs
Bruce and Jilla Abrams (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint (the
“Complaint”) against defendants Avant Luxury SFR Fund, LLC (“Avant”) and
Wellington Yang (collectively, “Defendants”) alleging causes of action for: (1)
breach of contract [count 1]; (2) breach of contract [count 2]; (3) negligence;
(4) breach of implied warranty; and (5) fraud. 
 
            On October 24, 2024, Mr. Abrams
filed the instant: (1) motion to compel further responses to form
interrogatories (FIs); (2) motion to compel further responses to special
interrogatories (SIs); (3) motion to compel further responses to request for
production (RFPs); and (4) motion to deem requests for admissions admitted
(RFAs) (collectively, the “Motions”). All four Motions include requests for
sanctions as well. The Motions are unopposed. 
 
DISCUSSION
            A motion to compel an initial
response can be made on the ground that a party did not serve a timely response
to interrogatories or a demand to produce. (Code Civil Procedure “CCP”) §§
2030.290, subd. (a) [interrogatories], 2031.300, subd. (a) [demand to produce];
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.)  The
discovering party can also make a motion to deem as admitted any unanswered
requests for admission or any requests answered in a late or unverified
response. (CCP § 2033.280, subd. (b); CCP, § 2033.240, subd. (a) [RFA responses
must be signed by responding party under oath]; Appleton v. Superior Court
(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636 [unsworn response to RFAs is treated like no
response].) These requests are not automatically deemed admitted; the
discovering party must make the motion. (CCP § 2033.280, subd. (b).)
To establish this ground, a movant must
show:
 
(1) Proper service (CCP §§ 2030.080, subd.
(a) [interrogatories], 2031.040 [demand to produce]); § 2033.070 [requests for
admission])
(2) Expiration of the deadline for the
initial response 30 days after service or on date agreed to by parties (CCP §§
2030.260, subds. (a), (b) [interrogatories], 2031.260, subds. (a), (b) [demand
to produce] 2033.250, subds. (a), (b) [requests for admission]); and
(3) No timely response. (CCP §§ 2030.290
[interrogatories], 2031.300 [demand to produce] § 2033.280, subd. (b) [requests
for admission])
 
A court must deny a motion to compel
initial discovery where the discovery sought is outside the scope of discovery.
(CBS, Inc. v. Superior Court (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, 19; CCP §
2017.010 [scope of discovery].)
 
            Mr. Abrams served Avant with the
FIs, SIs, RFPs and RFAs via e-mail on August 23, 2024. (All Mots., Vivoli Decl.
¶ 2, Ex. 1.) The deadline to respond was 30 days after service, plus two court
days for electronic service. (CCP § 1010.6 subd. (a)(3)(B)) Thus, responses
were due on September 24, 2024. As of the date of the hearing on these motions,
there is no evidence before the Court that Avant has responded to the discovery
requests. Thus, the Motions are GRANTED. 
 
Request for
Sanctions 
The Court must impose monetary sanctions
against anyone—party, nonparty, or attorney—who unsuccessfully makes or opposes
the motion, unless it finds that the person to be sanctioned acted with
substantial justification or other circumstances make the imposition of the
sanctions unjust. (CCP §§ 2030.290, subd. (c) [interrogatories], 2031.300,
subd. (c) [demand to produce]; Sinaiko, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at
404 [interrogatories and demand to produce].)
 
The Court must award sanctions when a
party’s response to request for admissions is untimely, and the discovering
party makes a motion to deem the requests admitted. (CCP, § 2033.280, subd.
(c); Appleton, supra, 206 Cal.App.3d at 635-636 [sanctions are
mandatory].)
 
The court may award sanctions under the
Discovery Act in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even
though no opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was
withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after
the motion was filed. (Rules of Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
 
Even after a party provides discovery
responses, a party can keep its motion on calendar and the court has authority
to grant sanctions, even if it denies the motion to compel responses “as
essentially unnecessary, in whole or in part.” (Sinaiko, supra, 148
Cal.App.4th at 409.)
 
Mr. Abrams requests sanctions for the
motion to compel responses to FIs against Avant and Avant’s counsel of record,
jointly and severally, in the total amount of $2,440.00 based upon counsel’s
rate of $595/hr. for: (1) 3.0 hours to draft the motion; (2) 1.0 hour to draft
a reply or notice of non-opposition; (3) 1.0 hour to attend the hearing on the
motion; and (4) $60 filing fee. (Mot. to Compel FIs, Vivoli Decl., ¶ 4.) 
 
Mr. Abrams requests sanctions for the
motion to compel responses to SIs against Avant and Avant’s counsel of record,
jointly and severally, in the total amount of $1,250.00 based upon counsel’s
rate of $595/hr. for: (1) 1.0 hour to draft the motion; (2) 1.0 hour to attend
the hearing on the motion; and (4) $60 filing fee. (Mot. to Compel SIs, Vivoli
Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
Mr. Abrams requests sanctions for the
motion to compel responses to RFPs against Avant and Avant’s counsel of record,
jointly and severally, in the total amount of $2,142.50 based upon counsel’s
rate of $595/hr. for: (1) 3.5 hours to draft the motion, draft a reply or
notice of non-opposition and attend the hearing on the motion; and (2) $60
filing fee. (Mot. to Compel RFPs, Vivoli Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
Mr. Abrams requests sanctions for the
motion to compel responses to RFAs against Avant and Avant’s counsel of record,
jointly and severally, in the total amount of $1,845.00 based upon counsel’s
rate of $595/hr. for: (1) 3.0 hours to draft the motion, draft a reply or
notice of non-opposition and attend the hearing on the motion; and (2) $60
filing fee. (Mot. to Compel RFAs, Vivoli Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
            The Court finds that 3.0 hours is a
reasonable amount of time to spend drafting the four Motions. A further
reduction is appropriate as no replies or notices of non-opposition were filed
and the time allocated for attending the hearings on the Motions is duplicative
and excessive, given that all the hearings are scheduled for the same date and
time and may be attended remotely. The Court notes as an aside that “notices of
non-opposition” are not helpful to the Court and should never be filed.  Accordingly, the Court will award sanctions
for: (1) 3.0 hours to draft the Motions; (2) .2 hours to attend the hearing on
the Motions; and (3) $240 in filing fees. Thus, the requests for sanctions are
GRANTED in the total amount of $1,964.00. 
 
The motion to compel responses to FIs, is
GRANTED. Avant is ordered to serve full, Code-compliant, verified responses,
without objections within 20 days.
The motion to compel responses to SIs, is
GRANTED. Avant is ordered to serve full, Code-compliant, verified responses,
without objections within 20 days.
 
The motion to compel responses to RFPs, is
GRANTED. Avant is ordered to serve full, Code-compliant, verified responses,
without objections within 20 days.
 
The
motion to deem RFAs admitted is GRANTED.  The admissions are deemed
ADMITTED as truth.
 
            Avant, and Avant’s counsel or
record, are ordered to remit sanctions in the total amount of $1,964.00 to Mr.
Abrams within 20 days of this order. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 


 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
