And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash deposition subpoenas filed by Defendant Kevin Young. The subpoenas were issued by Plaintiff Jane Doe to obtain business records from Gilead Services, Inc. and Amgen Inc. regarding Defendant's employment history and personnel records. Defendant argues that the subpoenas violate his right to privacy and are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Plaintiff argues that the information sought is relevant and reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

The judge denies the motion to quash in part, finding that the subpoenas are not overly broad and that discovery regarding similar complaints against Defendant in the context of prior employment is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The judge also limits the scope of allowable discovery to only include documents related to complaints of sexual harassment, harassment, discrimination, retaliation, sexual advances, or other inappropriate conduct made against Defendant.

The judge declines to award sanctions to either party, hoping that this ruling will be used by the parties to resolve similar discovery issues without resorting to the court.
