MOVING PARTY:  Defendant Emily Bannon (“Defendant”)
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff
Chris Nelson (“Plaintiff”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers.  
 
BACKGROUND
             Plaintiff filed this defamation and related
claims action on December 17, 2020. The operative first-amended complaint
(“FAC”) alleges causes of action for: (1) defamation per se; (2) defamation per
quod; (3) false light; (4) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (5)
intentional interference with prospective economic relations; (6) negligent
interference with prospective economic relations; and (7) injunctive relief. 
 
            On February 16, 2021, Defendant
filed a special motion to strike under Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section
425.16. The trial court denied the motion and Defendant filed an appeal. On August
29, 2024, the Court of Appeal issued a remittitur reversing the trial court’s
conclusion and remanding the matter to determine Plaintiff’s probability of
prevailing on the claim. 
 
            On October 8, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant renewed special motion to strike (the “Anti-SLAPP Motion” or the
“Motion”). On January 8, 2025, Plaintiff filed an opposition (the “Opposition”).
Plaintiff filed additional documents in support of his Opposition on January 9,
10, and 14, 2025. On January 15, 2025, Defendant filed a Reply.

JUDICIAL NOTICE 
            Pursuant
to Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (d), the Court may take judicial
notice of “[r]ecords of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record
of the United States or of any state of the United States”. 
 
The court,
however, may not take judicial notice of the truth of the contents of the
documents. (Herrera v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2011) 196
Cal.App.4th 1366, 1375.) Documents are only judicially noticeable to show their
existence and what orders were made such that the truth of the facts and
findings within the documents are not judicially noticeable. (Lockley v. Law
Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th
875, 885.)  
            
            Pursuant
to Plaintiff’s request, the Court takes judicial notice of Defendant's original
Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendant's Motion to Strike
under the Anti-SLAPP statute. 
 
            Pursuant
to Defendant’s request, the Court takes judicial notice of: (1) the complaint
in Nelson v. Bridgers, Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 21STCV35635,
filed 12/29/2021; (2) the decision of the Second District Court of Appeal,
Division One, in Nelson v. Bridgers, Case No. B325454, filed October 30, 2024       ; (3) the request
for judicial notice filed in support of the special motion to strike filed in
this case on 12/17/2020; and (4) the notice of ruling filed in this case on
1/31/22. 
 
DISCUSSION
            Anti-SLAPP analysis under CCP section
425.16 proceeds in two familiar steps. In the first step, the defendant or
moving party must make “a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action
is one ‘arising from’ protected activity.” (Barry v. State Bar of California
(2017) 2 Cal.5th 318, 321 [quotations omitted] (Barry).) In this
context, the term “protected activity” refers to speech or petitioning
activities. (Id.) A claim arises from protected activity when that
activity underlies or forms the basis for the claim; otherwise stated, “the
defendant’s act underlying the plaintiff’s cause of action [must] itself [be] …
an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.” (Park v.
Board of Trustees of California State University (2017) 2 Cal.5th 1057,
1063 [quotations omitted] (Park).) “[T]he focus is on determining what
‘the defendant’s activity [is] that gives rise to his or her asserted
liability—and whether that activity constitutes protected speech or
petitioning.’” (Id.) In teasing out whether protected conduct exists,
courts should consider the elements of the challenged claim and what actions by
the defendant supply those elements and consequently form the basis for
liability. (Id.) 
 
If the court finds the defendant or moving
party succeeds at the first step, then the burden shifts to the plaintiff to
“demonstrate[] a probability of prevailing on the claim.” (Id.
[quotations omitted].) At the second step, courts “evaluate the defendants’
evidence only to determine if it defeats that submitted by the plaintiff as a
matter of law. [I]n order to establish the requisite probability of prevailing,
the plaintiff need only have stated and substantiated a legally sufficient
claim. Put another way, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is
both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of
facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the
plaintiff is credited … That burden [is] not particularly high.” (Area 51
Productions, Inc. v. City of Alameda (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 581, 602 [quotations
and citations omitted] (Area 51 Productions, Inc.).) “Claims with the
requisite minimal merit may proceed.” (Navellier v. Sletten (2002) 29
Cal.4th 82, 94 (Navallier).) If the cause of action satisfies both
prongs of the anti-SLAPP statute, then it is subject to being struck. (Barry,
supra, 2 Cal.5th at p. 321.) 
 
As stated by our State’s highest Court:
“This is a ‘summary-judgment-like procedure at an early stage of the
litigation.’” (Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th
180, 192 (Varian).) 
First-Prong
Analysis
            The findings of the Court of Appeal as
stated in the remittitur issued on August 29, 2024 are the law of the case and
as such this Court adopts them. (8/29/2024 Remittitur.) In that decision, the
Court of Appeal held that Defendant’s “Instagram post qualifies as ‘protected
activity’ under the anti-SLAPP law.” (8/29/2024 Remittitur, p. 6.) The burden
thus shifts to Plaintiff to show a probability of prevailing on the merits. 
 
Second-Prong
Analysis  
            Once a defendant demonstrates that
protected conduct is at issue, the plaintiff must show that the complaint is
both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of
facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the
plaintiff is credited.¿ (Navellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at pp. 88-89.)
“The court does not weigh evidence or resolve conflicting factual claims. Its
inquiry is limited to whether the plaintiff has stated a legally sufficient
claim and made a prima facie factual showing sufficient to sustain a favorable
judgment.” (Baral v. Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 384.) Accordingly, as
explained in Baral, the second step of the analysis under section 425.16
requires a plaintiff to separately establish a probability of prevailing on
each distinct claim for relief: “[T]he plaintiff must make the requisite
showing as to each challenged claim that is based on allegations of protected
activity.” (Id. at p. 392.) 
 
            Defamation
The elements of any defamation claim are: (1)
intentional publication by defendant of a statement of fact (2) that is false,
(3) defamatory, (4) unprivileged and (5) has a natural tendency to injure or
that causes special damages. (Taus v. Loftus (2007) 40 Cal.4th 683, 720.)
When the defamed plaintiff is a public figure, to succeed against a special
motion to strike they must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the
challenged statement “was made with actual malice —that is, with knowledge that
it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.” (Jackson
v. Mayweather (2017) 10 Cal.App.5th 1240, 1259 [quotations omitted]; see
also Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 71,
84 (Christian).) 
 
            The Court of Appeal determined that
Plaintiff is a figure in the public eye. (8/29/2024 Remittitur, pp. 7-8.) Therefore,
in order to prevail on the Motion, he must show that Defendant acted with
actual malice. Defendant asserts that she did not act with malice in making
statements about Plaintiff's past acts of violence because these statements
were based on Plaintiff's own accounts of these incidents, which he shared with
her and others in her presence. (Mot. pp. 10:25-11:28; Bannon Depo. pp. 30-35,
43, 46, 56-58.) Defendant testified that “[Plaintiff] told me that he killed
the Latino man with a baseball bat.” (Bannon Depo. p. 43:4-8.) Additionally,
she verified with multiple individuals that Plaintiff had recounted the same
stories to them as he had told her. (Kunkle Decl. ¶ 3; Besel Decl. ¶ 3; Clancy
Decl. ¶ 7; Strugar Decl., Ex. D [Bridgers Depo.].) 
 
            Regarding the statements about Plaintiff
defrauding his neighbor, Defendant asserts that she spoke with the neighbor,
who verified the stories to her. (Mot., p. 12:4-20;
Bannon Depo. pp. 102-105; Supp. Bannon Decl., Ex. A.) Defendant testified
that the neighbor told her that “Mr. Nelson had forged his [the neighbor’s]
signature [and] defrauded him out of a ridiculous amount of money.” (Bannon
Depo. p. 103:24-25.) As to the statements about Plaintiff’s instrument
business, Defendant again asserts that Plaintiff was the one who told her that
he possessed stolen musical equipment and had manufactured fake vintage
guitars. (Mot. pp. 12:27-13:10; Bannon Depo., 52-55, 112-120.) Defendant also
presents testimony from other persons who state, “He told me to my face that he
stole $30,000 worth of gear”. (Strugar Decl., Ex. D [Bridgers Depo., p. 59:5-6.].)

 
            Lastly, Defendant asserts that
Plaintiff cannot show that she acted with malice when she posted “I am also one
of multiple women Chris has dated who has suspected that he was hacking them” because
she expressed her suspicion as an opinion, a cybersecurity expert verified that
her suspicion was credible before she made the statement on Instagram, and she stated
that she had no “irrefutable proof” and that Plaintiff denied that he had
hacked her. (Mot., pp. 13:17-14:21; Bannon Decl., Ex. A at p. 16; Sweet Decl.,
¶¶ 2-14.) 
 
            In the Opposition, Plaintiff argues
that there is circumstantial evidence that Plaintiff acted with malice because
Plaintiff and her other sources of information were unreliable and biased
against him and did not further investigate their claims. (Opp. pp. 9:23-10:2.)
Plaintiff relies on Reader’s Digest Assn. v. Superior Court (1984) 37
Cal.3d 244, for the proposition that “failure to investigate, anger and
hostility toward the plaintiff, reliance upon sources known to be unreliable,
or known to be biased against the plaintiff – such factors may, in an
appropriate case, indicate that the publisher himself had serious doubts
regarding the truth of his publication.” (Reader’s Digest Assn. v. Superior
Court (1984) 37 Cal.3d 244, 258 [citations omitted].) Such evidence,
however, “is relevant only to the extent that it reflects on the subjective
attitude of the publisher.” (Id.)
 
In opposing the Motion, Plaintiff relies
on his declaration and on Defendant’s testimony. He states that he has not
killed anyone or committed any of the other violent acts Defendant made
statements about. (Opp., pp. 10:4-16; Nelson Decl., ¶¶ 43-54.) Plaintiff
highlights Defendant’s deposition in which she stated, “A part of me wasn't
even certain that it was true because it seemed, I just found his lack of
remorse to be almost unbelievable to the point where I just had doubts about his
veracity.” (Bannon Decl. p. 48:19-25.) Plaintiff argues that he did not defraud
his neighbor and provides evidence that the two are still cordial. (Opp. p.,
11:19-20; Martel Decl. p. 1:27; Nelson Decl., ¶¶ 21-24) Plaintiff also asserts that
he has never manufactured or sold fake instruments or hacked any person.
(Nelson Decl., ¶¶ 25-33, 40-42.) Ultimately, viewing the evidence before the
Court as a whole, these contentions are insufficient to meet Plaintiff’s burden
to show actual malice by clear and convincing evidence. 
 
The requirement to prove actual malice by
clear and convincing evidence “presents a heavy burden, far in excess of the
preponderance sufficient for most civil litigation. The burden of proof by
clear and convincing evidence requires a finding of high probability. The
evidence must be so clear as to leave no substantial doubt. It must be
sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable
mind.” (Christian, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 84 [internal quotations
and citations omitted].) While Plaintiff maintains that the statements
Defendant made on Instagram are false, and that she was biased against him, he
fails to present clear and convincing evidence that Defendant believed the
statements were false. Thus, Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden to show a
probability of prevailing on the merits of his defamation causes of action. 
 
            Remaining Causes of Action
            Plaintiff’s remaining causes of
action for false light, intentional infliction of emotional distress,
interference with prospective economic relations and injunctive relief are
based upon the same facts and alleged defamatory statements. Thus, the Court’s
conclusion that Plaintiff has failed to show a probability of prevailing on his
defamation causes of action requires the remaining causes of action to be
stricken as well. 
 
            Defendant’s Special Motion to Strike
Under the Anti-SLAPP statute is GRANTED. The First-Amended Complaint is
STRICKEN. 
 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
