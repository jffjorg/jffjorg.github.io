the alternative, for summary adjudication of Plaintiffs Elias Gonzalez Lorenzo
aka Elias Gonzalez-Loreno’s (“Gonzalez Lorenzo”) and Ana Lazo’s (“Lazo”) (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) complaint on the following grounds: (1) Plaintiffs’ first cause
of action for violation of Song-Beverly Act – breach of express warranty is
without merit because Plaintiffs bought a used vehicle and Defendant did not
issue any express warranties at the time of sale [Issue 1]; (2)
Plaintiffs’ second cause of action for violation of Song-Beverly Act – breach
of implied warranty is without merit because Plaintiffs bought a used vehicle, Defendant
did not sell the Subject Vehicle and Defendant did not issue any express
warranties at the time of sale [Issue 2]; and (3) Plaintiffs’ third
cause of action for violation of Song-Beverly Act – Section 1793.2 is without

Evidentiary
Objections
Plaintiffs’

Procedural
Background
On January
4, 2019, Plaintiffs filed the operative complaint alleging three causes of
action: (1) violation of the Song Beverly Consumer Warranty Act
(“Song-Beverly”) – breach of express warranty, (2) violation of Song-Beverly – breach
of implied warranty, and (3) violation of Song-Beverly – §1793.2.  
On November
22, 2022, Defendant filed the instant motion. 
This Court previously ruled on the instant motion as unopposed on May
11, 2023.  However, this Court granted
Plaintiffs’ motion for relief under C.C.P. §473(b) for relief from this Court’s
May 11, 2023, ruling.  (10/30/23 Minute
Order.)  Plaintiffs filed their
opposition on November 28, 2023. 
Defendant filed its reply on December 7, 2023.
 
Summary
of Allegations
          On January 21, 2012, Plaintiffs purchased a 2011 Kia
Sorento (“Subject Vehicle”).  (Complaint
¶8.)  Plaintiffs allege the Subject
Vehicle was delivered to them with serious defects and nonconformities to
warranty and developed other serious defects and nonconformities to warranty
including, but not limited to, engine, SRS, transmission, brakes, and
electrical defects.  (Complaint ¶9.)  Plaintiffs allege express warranties
accompanied the sale of the Subject Vehicle by which Defendant undertook to
preserve or maintain the utility or performance of Plaintiffs’ vehicle or to
provide compensation if there was a failure in such utility or performance.  (Complaint ¶8.)  Plaintiffs allege they delivered the Subject
Vehicle to Defendant’s authorized sale representative(s), First Kia of Simi
Valley, on multiple occasions, and the Subject Vehicle was delivered for
repairs of the engine, SRS, transmission, brake and electrical, which amount to
nonconformities to the express warranties that accompanied the sale of the
Subject Vehicle.  (Complaint ¶47.)
 
Discussion            
Breach
of Express Warranty (1st COA) [Issue 1]
Civil Code §1793.2 requires a manufacturer to replace a defective “new
motor vehicle” or make restitution if, after a reasonable number of attempts,
the manufacturer (or its representative) is unable to repair the vehicle to
conform to the applicable express warranty.  (Civil Code §1793.2(d)(2).)
Defendant argues that pursuant to the recent holding in Rodriguez v.
FCA US, LLC, a used car cannot as a matter of law be considered a “new
motor vehicle” under Civil Code §1793.2 and, thus, Plaintiffs do not have a
cause of action for breach of express warranty under §1793.2 because they, like
the Plaintiffs in Rodriguez, bought a used vehicle with a balance
remaining on the new vehicle warranty. 
(Motion, pg. 2; Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th
209, 222-223, pending review (July 13, 2022).)  
In Rodriguez, the buyer of a used truck, which still had a
balance on the manufacturer’s limited powertrain warranty at the time the buyer
purchased it from a used car dealership, brought an action against the
manufacturer for breach of express warranty under Civil Code
§1793.2(d)(2).  The trial court granted
the manufacturer’s motion for summary judgment. 
The Court of Appeal upheld the trial court’s ruling and held that a used
truck with an unexpired express warranty was not a “new motor vehicle” subject to
the refund-or-replace provision of the Song-Beverly Act.  (Rodriguez, 77 Cal.App.5th at pg. 215.)
The Rodriguez Court explained that Civil Code §1793.2(d)(2)
applies to the sales of new vehicles only, which is defined in Civil
Code §1793.22(e)(2) as, “a new motor vehicle that is bought or used primarily
for personal, family, or household purposes . . . [and includes] a dealer-owned
vehicle and a ‘demonstrator’ or other motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer's
new car warranty.”  The Rodriguez
Court considered the language of the provision, its statutory context, and
legislative intent and history and concluded that the phrase “‘other motor
vehicle sold with a manufacturer’s new car warranty’ unambiguously refers to
cars that come with a new or full express warranty.”  (Id. at pg. 222.)  The Rodriguez Court found that the
plaintiff had no recourse under the Song Beverly Act because his used car
purchased from a third-party dealership without any evidence that any express
warranties had been issued to plaintiff at the time of sale, did not
meet the definition of “new motor vehicle.” 
(Id. at pg. 225.)
The California Supreme Court has granted review of Rodriguez, but
ordered under Rule 8.1115(e)(3) that “pending review, [Rodriguez] may be
cited, not only for its persuasive value, but also for the limited purpose of
establishing the existence of a conflict in authority that would in turn allow
trial courts to exercise discretion under Auto Equity Sales Inc. v. Superior
Court (1962) 57 Cal.2d 450 to choose between sides of any such conflict.”  (Rodriguez v. FCA US (Cal. 2022) 295
Cal.Rptr.3d 351, 351; CRC, Rule 8.1115(e)(3).)
Defendant submitted evidence that the Subject Vehicle was not a new
motor vehicle under Song-Beverly.  Specifically,
Defendant submitted
evidence that Glendale Kia is an independent third-party dealer not owned by
Defendant.  (Defendant’s Undisputed Separate Statement of Fact [“D-USSF”] 2.)  Defendant submitted evidence that it was the
original distributor of the Subject Vehicle when it was new and made express
warranties with respect to the Subject Vehicle when it was new but did not make
any express warranties with respect to the sale of the Subject Vehicle as a
used vehicle.  (Defendant’s Disputed Separate Statement of Fact [“D-DSSF”] 4; Decl. of Lewis ¶6.)  However, Defendant failed to produce
admissible evidence that that Subject Vehicle was not a demonstrator.  Defendant failed to meet its
burden to show that there is no triable issue of material fact as to the first
cause of action and does not shift the burden to Plaintiffs to demonstrate a
triable issue of material fact.  
Assuming, arguendo, Defendant met its burden, Plaintiff submitted
evidence demonstrating a triable issue of material fact as to whether Defendant’s
warranties are transferrable to subsequent owners.  (P-DSSF 4; Decl. of Mukai, Exh. 2; Exh. 3 at 45:1-4,
51:25-53:3, 54:5-54:8, 54:14-55:23, 57:3-24, 58:19-59:11, 60:1-61:18, 61:22-62:14,
63:2-64.1, 66:3-14, 66:21-67:2, 68:8-69:8, 74:22-75:4, 76:15-23; 82:16-22, 83:3-84:9,
85:20-22; Exh. 4 at 93:21-24.)
Accordingly, summary judgment is denied. 
In the alternative, summary adjudication is denied as to the 1st
cause of action [Issue 1] for breach of express warranty.
 
Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability (2nd COA) [Issue
2]
Civil Code §1795.5 only imposes implied warranty liability on “the
distributor or retail seller making express warranties with respect to used
consumer goods (and not the original manufacturer, distributor or retail seller
making express warranties with respect to such goods when new).”  (Civ. Code §1795.5(a).)  
“[O]nly distributors or sellers of used goods . . . have implied
warranty obligations in the sale of used goods.”  (Ruiz Nunez v. FCA US, LLC (2021) 61
Cal.App.5th 385, 399.)  In Kiluk v.
Mercedes-Benz USA LLC, the court found defendant Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC
issued a used vehicle warranty—a certified preowned warranty—in addition to its
already existing new vehicle warranty §1795.5, which applied to the defendant
manufacturer.  (Kiluk v. Mercedes-Benz
USA LLC (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 334, 338-340.)  The Kiluk Court stated the implied
warranty does not attach to every subsequent sale or lease of a vehicle simply
because the original new vehicle warranty is still in effect.  (Id. at pg. 340 n.4.)  Instead, it only applies to a manufacturer or
distributor who gives a used vehicle warranty with the sale or lease of a used
car.  
Defendant moves for summary adjudication of Plaintiffs’ 2nd cause of
action for breach of implied warranty on the grounds that Plaintiff bought a
used car; Defendant did not sell the car, and Defendant did not issue
any express warranty with respect to the used car.  (Motion at pgs. 2-4.)  As discussed above, Defendant failed to meet its
burden to demonstrate that the Subject Vehicle was not a “demonstrator,” and
that there is no triable issue of fact.  
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for summary adjudication as to
Plaintiff’s 2nd cause of action for breach of implied warranty is denied.
 
Violation of Song-Beverly §1793.2 (3rd
COA) [Issue 3]
Section 1793.2 provides, “[e]very manufacturer of consumer goods
sold in this state and for which the manufacturer has made an express warranty
shall . . . [m]aintain in this state sufficient service and repair facilities
reasonably close to all areas where its consumer goods are sold to carry out
the terms of those warranties or designate and authorize in this state as
service and repair facilities independent repair or service facilities
reasonably close to all areas where its consumer goods are sold to carry out
the terms of the warranties.”  (Civ. Code
§1793.2(a)(1)(A).)
Defendant moves for summary adjudication of Plaintiffs’ 3rd cause of
action for violation of §1793.2 on the grounds that the statute does not apply
to sales of used vehicles with some balance remaining on the New Vehicle
Limited Warranty.  (Motion, pg. 4; see
Rodriguez, 77 Cal.App.5th at pgs. 222-223.)  Defendant argues although its new vehicle
warranties may have still been in effect when Plaintiffs purchased the Subject
Vehicle, Defendant did not give Plaintiffs any additional used vehicle
warranties when they purchased the Subject Vehicle.  (Motion, pgs. 4-5.)  As discussed above, Defendant failed to meet
its burden to demonstrate that the Subject Vehicle was not a “demonstrator,”
and that there is no triable issue of fact. 

Accordingly, Defendants’ motion for summary adjudication as to
Plaintiff’s third cause of action for negligent repair is denied.
 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Defendants’
motion for summary judgment is denied. 
Defendants’ motion in the alternative for summary adjudication of the 1st,
2nd, and 3rd causes of action is denied.
Moving party to give notice.
