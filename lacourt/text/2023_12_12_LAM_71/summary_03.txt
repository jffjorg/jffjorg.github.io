The judge has reconsidered the previous ruling that granted FCA's motion to compel arbitration. The case involves a warranty contract between the plaintiff, Merary Gomez Carabajal, and FCA regarding a 2020 Jeep Cherokee. The plaintiff alleges breach of warranty and negligent repair. FCA moved to compel arbitration, arguing that the contract allows for arbitration. However, the court has found that FCA does not have the power to elect arbitration and that the plaintiff is not bound by the arbitration agreement. The court has denied FCA's motion to compel arbitration and vacated the previous ruling. The case will proceed to a hearing on December 12, 2023.
