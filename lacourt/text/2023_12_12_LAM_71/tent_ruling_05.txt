 Case No.: 
  22STCV32618
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 12, 2023



 
Defendant Barrett
Financial Group, LLC’s motion for a protective
order for the exchange of information regarding Barrett’s
confidential and proprietary information, and to preserve the private
information of mortgage loan borrowers and other third-party company employees
is denied as to the “Attorney’s Eyes Only” designation and is otherwise granted.
 
          Defendant Barrett Financial Group, LLC
(“Barrett”) (“Defendant”) moves for a
protective order for the exchange of information regarding Barrett’s
confidential and proprietary information, and to preserve the private
information of mortgage loan borrowers and other third-party company employees.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 1.)  
 
          Background
On October 5, 2022,
Plaintiff Andrew Taylor (“Taylor”) (“Plaintiff”) filed his initial
complaint.  On November 14, 2022, Plaintiff filed his first amended
complaint (“FAC”).  On May 15, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the operative second amended Complaint (“SAC”) against
Defendant alleging eight causes of action: (1) failure to pay wages on time and
at termination; (2) failure to pay overtime wages; (3) failure to provide
accurate wage statements; (4) failure to provide meal periods; (5) failure to
provide rest periods; (6) failure to reimburse; (7) unfair business practices;
and (8) penalties pursuant to PAGA (Labor Code §§2698, et seq.).  (See
FAC.)   
On October 31, 2023, Defendant
filed the instant motion.  On November 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed his
opposition.  On December 1, 2023, Defendant filed its reply.  
 
Meet and Confer
          Defendant’s counsel
declares he discussed with Plaintiff’s counsel via email on November 28, 2023,
regarding the issues in this motion. 
(Decl. of Wright ¶9, Exh. A.)  The
Court finds Defendant’s counsel’s declaration states facts showing a “reasonable and
good faith attempt” to resolve the matter outside of court.  (C.C.P. §§2016.040, 2033.080(a).) 
 
Legal Standard 
C.C.P. §2033.080(b)
provides that a party that has received discovery may file a motion for a
protective order, seeking a variety of types of orders “that justice requires
to protect any party from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or
undue burden and expense.”
The decision upon whether
to enter a protective order lies within the sound discretion of the court.  (Raymond Handling Concepts
Corp. v. Superior Court (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 584, 588, 591; Meritplan Insurance
Co. v. Superior Court (1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 237, 242.)  Moving
parties have the burden to show good cause for the protective order.  (Emerson
Electric Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 16 Cal.4th 1101,
1110.)   
 
          Discussion
Defendant’s motion for protective order is denied as
to the requirement that there is a second tier of the proposed protective order
designated “Highly Confidential – Attorney’s Eyes Only,” but is
otherwise granted.  On balance, Defendant
failed to meet its burden to demonstrate it needs protection from the
individual Plaintiff with regard to reviewing Defendant’s wage and hour data.  
Under Williams v. Superior Court and Hill v.
National Collegiate Athletic Association, Defendant has the burden of establishing:
(1) a legally protected privacy interest, (2) a reasonable expectation of
privacy under the circumstances, and (3) conduct by Plaintiff constituting a
serious invasion of that privacy interest. (See Hill v. National
Collegiate Athletic Association (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1,
39-40; Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 552.)  If Defendant can meet its burden, the court
must then weigh the alleged invasion of privacy against Plaintiff’s
countervailing interests.  (See Hill,
7 Cal.4th at pgs. 37-38 [“Privacy concerns are not absolute; they must be
balanced against other important interests . . . Invasion of a privacy interest
is not a violation of the state constitutional right to privacy if the invasion
is justified by a competing interest.”].)
Wage and hour data, and other employment records, are not
secrets as a matter of law.  Employers
are required to turn over employee wage and hour data to employees and/or the
Labor Commissioner without preconditions.  (See Lab. Code §§226(b), 247.5, 1174,
1198.5.)  California law also expressly
allows employees to discuss and share their wages and working conditions with
whoever they like.  (See Lab. Code
§§232, 232.5.)
In Williams, the California Supreme Court held
that a PAGA representative is entitled to the contact information for all aggrieved
employees in a PAGA action.  (Williams, 3 Cal.5th at pg.
549.)  The Williams Court
also affirmed its ruling in Hill regarding
the test for weighing a third-party’s privacy interests against a party’s right
to discovery.  (Williams,
3 Cal.5th at pgs. 552-553, 557.)
Here, Plaintiff acknowledges that the information sought
implicates third-party employees’ privacy interests, and the records Plaintiff
seeks fall within the category of “informational privacy,” which invokes a
lower standard of protection that “autonomy privacy.”  (See Hill, 7 Cal.4th at pg. 34.)  The seriousness of the alleged invasion of
privacy can be mitigated by protective measures, which in this case include a
Belair-West notice and protective order.  (See id., at pg. 38 [“[I]f intrusion
is limited and confidential information is carefully shielded from disclosure
except to those who have a legitimate need to know, privacy concerns are
assuaged.”].)
Plaintiff sufficiently demonstrated, on balance, a
countervailing interest in having access to the information sought.  In pursuing a PAGA claim, Plaintiff is acting
as the deputized agent of the State on behalf of and for the benefit of the
very employees whose records are sought. The issue in Williams involved
the disclosure of contact information, but the same rationale applies here:
that “fellow employees ‘might reasonably expect, and even hope, that their
[information] would be given to’ a plaintiff seeking to vindicate their
rights.”  (Williams, 3 Cal.5th at
pg. 554, citing Pioneer Electronics (USA), Inc. v. Superior Court (2007)
40 Cal.4th 360, 372.)  Considering the
lower standard of protection for the type of information sought, the protective
order that will protect the employees’ privacy interests, and the compelling
interest by the state, Plaintiff, and the employees themselves in allowing
Plaintiff to obtain these records, the standard set forth in Hill and Williams
strongly favors the release of those records subject to a standard protective
order.
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s motion for a protective order is denied as to
the requirement that there is a second tier of the proposed protective order
designated “Highly Confidential – Attorney’s Eyes Only,” and is otherwise
granted.
Moving Party to give notice.
