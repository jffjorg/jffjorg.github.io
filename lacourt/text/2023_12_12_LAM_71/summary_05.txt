Here is the English-text summary:

The Tentative Ruling denies Defendant Barrett Financial Group, LLC's motion for a protective order for the exchange of information regarding Barrett's confidential and proprietary information, and to preserve the private information of mortgage loan borrowers and other third-party company employees. The court grants the motion, but only to the extent that it denies the request for a "Highly Confidential – Attorney's Eyes Only" designation. The court finds that Defendant failed to meet its burden to demonstrate a need for protection from the individual Plaintiff, and that Plaintiff has a countervailing interest in having access to the information sought. The court also finds that the wage and hour data and other employment records are not secrets as a matter of law, and that Plaintiff's right to discovery outweighs Defendant's privacy concerns.
