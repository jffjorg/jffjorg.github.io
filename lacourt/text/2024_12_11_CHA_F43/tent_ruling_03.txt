SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
July 1, 2023, Plaintiffs Enrique Gomez and Marcy Linares (Plaintiffs) were
involved in a vehicle collision with Defendant Alejandra Gomez
(Defendant).  As a result of the
collision, Plaintiffs suffered damages and serious injuries.  Plaintiffs filed this action against
Defendant on June 17, 2024, alleging causes of action for (1) negligence and
(2) “negligence involvement”.  The
“negligence involvement” cause of action appears largely duplicative of the
first cause of action.  
 
On
July 29, 2024, Defendant propounded her Requests for Production, Set One on
Plaintiffs.  Responses were due August
30, 2024.  Defendant gave Plaintiffs two
deadline extensions, but Plaintiffs did not serve responses. 
 
On
October 31, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to compel responses to her Form
Interrogatories, Set One.  No opposition
has been filed.
 
Meet and Confer
A
motion to compel answers or produce documents must include a declaration
stating facts showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the
issues mentioned in the motion before filing. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.480, subd. (b), 2016.040.)  
 
Defendant’s
counsel of record, Michael J. Lowell, declares he attempted to meet and confer
with Plaintiff’s counsel before filing this motion.  (Declaration of Michael J. Lowell, ¶ 2, Exh.
A.)  After Plaintiffs missed the August
30 deadline, Mr. Lowell sent Plaintiffs’ counsel a meet and confer letter
informing Plaintiffs they waived all objections and extending Plaintiffs’
deadline to respond to October 1, 2024. 
(Lowell Dec., ¶ 3, Exh. B.)  After
Plaintiffs missed the October 1 deadline, Mr. Lowell sent Plaintiffs’ counsel a
second letter extending the time to respond to October 15, 2024.  (Lowel Dec., ¶ 4, Exh. C.)  As of October 31, 2024, Plaintiffs have not
served responses.  
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
A
demanding party may move to compel responses to requests for production where
the responding party fails to provide any responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.300, subd. (b),
2030.290, subd. (b).)  The demanding
party must show the requests were properly served, that the time to respond
expired, and no response has been served. 
(Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403-404.)  
 
The
responding party must respond separately to each demand by agreeing to comply,
stating an inability to comply, or objecting to all or part of the demand.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.210, subd. (a).)  The responding party must serve responses
within 30 days after the requests for production are served or according to an
agreed upon deadline extension.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a)(1)-(3).) 

 
Failing
to respond within statutory time limits waives objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(a).)  The court may relieve the
responding party of waiver if the responding party subsequently served
substantially compliant responses, and the party’s failure to serve timely
responses was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  (Ibid.; City of Fresno v. Superior
Court (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1459, 1467 [applying the same standards as
defaults under section 473, subdivision (b)].) 

 
Defendant
has shown that she properly served Plaintiffs on July 29, 2024.  Plaintiffs did not serve responses by the
original August 30 deadline or any of Defendant’s subsequent deadline
extensions.  As of October 31, 2024,
Plaintiffs have not served responses.  
 
Accordingly,
the Court orders Plaintiffs to serve code-compliant, objection-free responses to
Defendant’s Request for Production, Set One.
 
            Sanctions
The
Court may impose sanctions against any party who “unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel responses to [inspection demands] unless, it finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 
Defendant
requests $1,135.00 in monetary sanctions against Plaintiffs and their
counsel.  Defendant’s counsel, Michael J.
Lowell, charges an hourly rate of $250.00. 
(Lowell Dec., ¶ 7.)  Defendant’s
other counsel, Meredith J. Norris, Esq., charges an hourly rate of
$225.00.  (Lowell Dec., ¶ 6.)  The request includes the following: (1) Ms.
Norris spent 2 hours preparing this motion ($450.00); (2) Mr. Lowell
anticipates 2.5 hours preparing for and attending the motion hearing ($625.00);
and (3) a $60.00 filing fee.  (Lowell
Dec., ¶ 7.)  
 
The
Court finds the hourly rates are reasonable, but the time spent on this motion
is unreasonable.  This motion is
virtually identical to five separate discovery motions Defendant filed, and the
issues are not complex. 
 
Accordingly,
the Court grants Defendant’s request in the reduced amount of $535.00: (1) 1
hour preparing this motion; (2) 1 hour preparing for and attending the motion
hearing; and (3) a $60.00 filing fee.

within twenty (20) days of the date of this order.
