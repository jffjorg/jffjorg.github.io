[2]           Plaintiffs cite Knapp v. Palisades
Charter High School (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 708, 714 for the
proposition that a charter school’s relationship to the chartering district is
contractual.  At issue in Knapp
was whether charter schools were exempt from the claim presentation
requirements of the government tort claims acts.  Although the relationship is to some extent
contractual, it is also in large measure statutory.  (Wells v. One2One Learning Foundation
(2006) 39 Cal.4th 1164, 1186 [for some purposes charter schools are
deemed to be part of the public school system that falls under the jurisdiction
and exclusive control of public school officers;  charter schools must therefore comply with
the terms of their charter and other specified laws];  Wilson v. State Board of Education
(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1139-1140 [school districts have
continuing oversight and monitoring powers over charter schools and can revoke
a charter for material violations of the charter or any law].)
