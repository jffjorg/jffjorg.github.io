  Case Number:  21STCV17487    Hearing Date:   February 5, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE  NAME:  Linda  Marie Aversa, et al. v. Ford Motor Company, LTD, et al.  Defendant  Kaj Wendall Faaborg’s Motion for Sanctions Against Plaintiff Ricardo Olivas  TENTATIVE  RULING The Court GRANTS the motion for terminating sanctions. The Court DENIES  Faaborg’s request for monetary sanctions.               Faaborg is ordered to give notice of  the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.  BACKGROUND This is a wrongful death case arising out of an auto accident on January  9, 2020. On May 10, 2023, plaintiffs Linda Marie Aversa, individually and as  the successor-in-interest to the Estate of Jeremy Richard Olivas (Aversa) and  Ricardo Olivas (Olivas) filed this action (Case Number 21STCV17487) against  defendants Ford Motor Company, LTD, Will Tiesiera Ford, Inc., Kaj Wendall  Faaborg (Faaborg), and Does 1 through 50, alleging causes of action for strict  product liability, negligent product liability, and motor vehicle negligence.  On May 13, 2021, plaintiff Marshall Tanaka filed a complaint in  Case Number 21STCV18090 against defendants Ford Motor Company, LTD, Will  Tiesiera Ford, Inc., Kaj Wendall Faaborg, and Does 1 through 50, alleging  causes of action for strict product liability, negligent product liability, and  motor vehicle negligence.  On December 8, 2021, the Court consolidated Case Numbers  21STCV17487 and 21STCV18090, with Case Number 21STCV17487 designated as the  lead case.  On December 29, 2021, Aversa filed a request for dismissal of her claims  under Case Number 21STCV17487 without prejudice. The dismissal was entered on  January 11, 2022.  On January 5, 2022, Aversa filed a separate complaint under Case  Number 22STCV00500 against Ford Motor Company, LTD, Will Tiesiera Ford, Inc.,  Kaj Wendall Faaborg, and Does 1 through 50, alleging causes of action for  strict product liability, negligent product liability, motor vehicle  negligence, and successor-in-interest damages including decedent Jeremy Olivas’  non-economic damages and for exemplary damages.  On  August 2, 2022, Court consolidated Case Numbers 21STCV17487, 21STCV18090, and  22STCV00500, with Case Number 21STCV17487 designated as the lead case.  On December 28, 2023, Defendant Faaborg filed a motion for  sanctions against Plaintiff Ricardo Olivas. The motion is unopposed. On January  29, 2024, Faaborg filed a notice of non-opposition from Olivas.  LEGAL  STANDARD The court is  authorized, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, to impose the  following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the  discovery process: monetary sanctions, issue sanctions, evidence sanctions, terminating  sanctions, and contempt. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subds. (a)-(e).) A terminating  sanction may be imposed by an order dismissing the action of the party that  brought the action. (Id., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(3).)    “The  discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions,  starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of  termination. [Citation.]” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.¿(2009)  174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992; see J.W. v. Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of  New York, Inc. (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 1142, 1169.) If a lesser sanction  fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted. (Doppes, supra, 174  Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) “Discovery sanctions ‘should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not  exceed what is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but  denied discovery.’” (Id.) “But where a violation is willful, preceded by  a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not  produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in  imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Id., quoting Mileikowsky v. Tenet  Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262,  279–280); Creed-21 v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702, quoting  Doppes and Mileikowsky.)  The court  should consider the totality of the circumstances, including conduct of the  party to determine if the actions were willful, the determent to the propounding  party, and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain discovery. (Lang  v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) Terminating sanctions should  not be ordered lightly, but are justified where a violation is willful,  preceded by a history of abuse, and there is evidence that less severe  sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules. (Doppes,  supra, 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.)  Before any  sanctions may be imposed the court must make an express finding that there has  been a willful failure of the party to serve the required discovery responses.  (Fairfield v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d  113, 118.) The party who failed to comply with discovery obligations has the  burden of showing that the failure was not willful. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978)  84 Cal.App.3d 771, 788; Cornwall v. Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d  250, 252-253.)       Code of Civil  Procedure, section 2023.010, subdivisions (d) and (f) provide that a misuse of  the discovery process includes, but is not limited to, “[f]ailing to respond or  to submit to an authorized method of discovery” and “[m]aking  an evasive response to discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d),  (f).)  DISCUSSION Terminating Sanctions             “The power to impose discovery sanctions is a broad  discretion subject to reversal only for arbitrary, capricious, or whimsical  action. [Citations.] Only two factors are absolutely prerequisite to imposition  of the sanction: (1) there must be a failure to comply ... and (2) the failure  must be wilful [sic].... [Citation.]” (R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative  Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 496.)  Defendant Faaborg seeks terminating sanctions to have Plaintiff Olivas’  complaint dismissed due to Olivas’ repeated failures to comply with discovery. Faaborg  indicates having served written discovery requests on Olivas on May 9, 2022.  (Jackson Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. 1.) Olivas failed to provide responses. (See Id.,  ¶¶ 4-5.) Counsel for Faaborg called Olivas, confirmed his address, discussed his  overdue responses, and granted Olivas an additional ten days to provide  responses. (Id.) Olivas failed again to provide responses. (Id., ¶¶ 6-7.) Counsel for Faaborg sent Olivas a  letter on June 29, 2022 regarding the overdue responses, but still received no  response. (Id.)  Due to Olivas’ lack of responses,  Faaborg proceeded with motions to compel. (Jackson Decl., ¶ 7.) On April 20,  2023, the Court granted Faaborg’s motions to compel and ordered Olivas to  provide verified responses to Faaborg's written discovery requests within 30  days of the date of the ruling. (Minute Order (4/20/23).) On October 10, 2023,  counsel for Faaborg sent a letter to Olivas regarding the continuing lack of  responses and requested Olivas to provide responses within 30 days. (Jackson  Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. 3.) Olivas still has not provided any responses or responded to  counsel for Faaborg’s letter. (Jackson Decl., ¶ 9.)  The Court further notes that Olivas has exhibited a consistent  pattern of not participating in this action and complying with discovery  obligations. The Court’s April 20, 2023 order granted Defendants Ford Motor  Company and Will Tiesiera Ford, Inc.’s motion for terminating sanctions against  Olivas for the same patterns of behavior. (Minute Order (4/20/23).) Faaborg’s  motion is unfortunately further evidence of Olivas’ failure to participate in  this action and comply with discovery obligations. Olivas has also failed to file an opposition demonstrating that his noncompliance was not willful. Based on the foregoing, the Court finds Olivas failed and refused to  comply with the Court’s April 20, 2023 order and his ongoing discovery  obligations, and that his failure to comply was willful. (See Doppes, supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Given Olivas' prior failures to comply with discovery obligations and apparent disinterest in prosecuting this action, the Court further finds that imposing lesser  sanctions would not produce compliance. Therefore, the Court GRANTS Faaborg’s motion for  terminating sanctions.  Issue and Evidentiary Sanctions Given the Court’s decision to grant terminating sanctions,  Faaborg’s alternative request for issue and evidentiary sanctions is moot.[1]  Monetary Sanctions Given the Court’s decision to grant terminating sanctions, the  Court does not find imposition of further monetary sanctions necessary. While  the Court does not deny that  Olivas  misused the discovery process by failing to respond to discovery requests, the  Court exercises its discretion to not impose monetary sanctions. Therefore, the  Court DENIES Faaborg’s request for monetary sanctions. (See Code Civ. Proc., §  2023.030, subd. (a).)  CONCLUSION The Court GRANTS the motion for terminating sanctions. The Court DENIES  Faaborg’s request for monetary sanctions.               Faaborg is ordered to give notice of  the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
