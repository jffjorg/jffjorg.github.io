BACKGROUND On December  12, 2017, Plaintiffs Yan Li and Mesarica Management, LLC filed a complaint  against Defendants April Lin; Han International Group, Inc., dba Han Realty;  Shigang Li; Jui Yuan Cheng; and Moon Management Consulting, LLC.  On July 8,  2020, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against Defendants April  Lin; Han International Group, Inc., dba Han Realty; Shigang Li; Zhigang Yang; and  Moon Management Consulting, LLC.  Defendant April  Lin was dismissed from the FAC on September 19, 2023.  LEGAL STANDARD Code of Civil  Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party has  failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party seeking  judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment,  and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible  evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as  necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of  judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or  an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579,  supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary;  and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement  of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)  ANALYSIS Plaintiffs  seek default judgment against each of the Defaulted Defendants in the total  amount of $140,305.05, comprised solely of $139,811.75 in damages, $38.30 per  diem (10%) in interest, and $455.00 in costs.  Plaintiffs have not submitted any evidence substantiating Plaintiffs’ claimed  damages against Defendant Zhigang Yang. The FAC and the supporting default  judgment declarations are devoid of any allegations of wrongdoing directed at  Defendant Zhigang Yang. For these reasons, the request for entry of default  judgment against Defendant Zhigang Yang is denied with prejudice.  As to the  remaining Defaulted Defendants, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have submitted  sufficient evidence to support the requests for entry of default judgment.  However, Plaintiffs did not request prejudgment interest in the FAC and  therefore cannot recover prejudgment interest. Accordingly, the Court will  grant the requests for entry of default judgment in the reduced amount of  $140,266.75, consisting of $139,811.75 in damages and $455.00 in costs.  CONCLUSION For the  reasons set forth above, the request for entry of default judgment against  Defendant Zhigang Yang is DENIED with prejudice. The request for entry of default judgment  against Defendants Shigang Li, Moon  Management Consulting, LLC, and Han International Group Inc., dba Han Realty is  GRANTED, jointly and severally, in the reduced amount of  $140,266.75, consisting of $139,811.75 in damages and $455.00 in costs.Plaintiffs to submit one proposed Judgment (Form JUD-100) reflecting the reduced amount and only as to Defendants Shigang Li, Moon Management Consulting, LLC, and Han International Group Inc., dba Han Realty.
