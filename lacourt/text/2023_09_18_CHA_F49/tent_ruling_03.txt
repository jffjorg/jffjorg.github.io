SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
Evelyn Gallegos was a student at Germain Elementary School with the Los Angeles
Unified School District (LAUSD). Plaintiff alleges bullying by fellow students
and the failure of the school principal, defendant Luis Lopez, to address the
bullying, even after a transfer of the student to a new classroom. Plaintiff
alleges a particularly violent incident on March 5, 2020, which plaintiff
alleges the final act in the course of conduct leading to the subject action.
 
On
July 9, 2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress, Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress, Negligence, and
Negligent Supervision. On November 3, 2021, the action was transferred from
Department 31 to Department 49. 
 
New
counsel for Plaintiff substituted into the case on January 3, 2022. On May 18,
2022, the court sustained the demurrer of Los Angeles Unified School District
and Luis Lopez with leave to amend. On June 13, 2022, Plaintiff filed a first
amended complaint for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress, Negligence, and Negligent Supervision. On
September 1, 2022, the court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend. 
 
On
September 20, 2022, Plaintiff filed the second amended complaint for Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress, Negligence, and Negligent Supervision. On
March 2, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to
the first cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress, and
overruled as to the remainder of the operative complaint. The court also
granted the motion to strike the punitive damages claims with prejudice.
Defendants answered the remaining causes of action on March 21, 2023. 
 
On
May 4, 2023, the court granted the motion of counsel for Plaintiff to be
relieved as counsel of record. 
 
RULING: Granted.
Defendants
Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) move to deem admissions admitted against
plaintiff Evelyn Gallegos. 
 
LAUSD represents
service of Request for Admissions (set one) on May 26, 2023. [Declaration of Sabryna
Beckles, ¶ 6, Ex. A.] According to Plaintiff, at the time of the filing of the
motion, no responses were received. [Id., ¶ 7.] The subject discovery was
served via electronic service following an agreement to accept service to a
designated e-mail account. [Id., ¶ 5.] The court therefore finds service valid,
and assumes former counsel forwarded the file to the former clients. 
 
The
motion is unopposed. The court electronic filing system shows no reply filed at
the time of the tentative ruling publication cutoff. The unopposed motion is
granted. Request for Admissions (set one) is deemed admitted. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b).) Given the lack of any service of responses, sanctions
are mandatory without any discretion of the court to waive sanctions. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) Because Plaintiff is a minor and the
guardian parent possibly remains unhoused, the court imposes $25 in sanctions
against guardian ad litem Karen Gallegos only. Payable in 175 days.
 
Two motions to compel responses to form interrogatories and
request for production of documents set for September 25, and October 2, 2023,
respectively.
 
LAUSD to give notice.
