**Significant Statements**
```
The court takes judicial notice of the filed pleadings and declarations, but cannot take judicial notice of the truth of any matters asserted within the requested items.
The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties' pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.
The court declines to consider the subject argument from an evidentiary point of view to the extent the argument was derived from previously filed pleadings and the truth of the subject matter cannot be considered via judicial notice.
The plain language of Articles V and VIII, and Civil Code section 2782, subdivision (b) and Insurance Code section 11580.4, support the argument of City of Santa Clarita limiting the bar to indemnity claims arising from "active negligence."
The court therefore denies the motion for summary adjudication and finds triable issues of material of fact on the issue of duty regarding the duty of Tobo to indemnify claims arising from obligations in Articles V and VIII of the "Redevelopment Agency Agreement for Capital Improvement Project" agreement.
