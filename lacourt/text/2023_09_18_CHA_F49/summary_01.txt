```
**Significant Statements**
```
The court takes judicial notice of the filed pleadings and declarations, but cannot take judicial notice of the truth of any matters asserted within the requested items.
The purpose of a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties' pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.
The court declines to consider the subject argument from an evidentiary point of view to the extent the argument was derived from previously filed pleadings and the truth of the subject matter cannot be considered via judicial notice.
The plain language of Articles V and VIII, and Civil Code section 2782, subdivision (b) and Insurance Code section 11580.4, support the argument of City of Santa Clarita limiting the bar to indemnity claims arising from "active negligence."
The court therefore denies the motion for summary adjudication and finds triable issues of material of fact on the issue of duty regarding the duty of Tobo to indemnify claims arising from obligations in Articles V and VIII of the "Redevelopment Agency Agreement for Capital Improvement Project" agreement.

english_summary: |
  The Judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a motion for summary adjudication filed by Tobo Construction, Inc. against the City of Santa Clarita. The case revolves around a construction project near the "Historical Jailhouse" in Santa Clarita, where the City is being sued for damages allegedly caused by the construction. Tobo argues that they fulfilled their contractual obligations by naming the City as an additional insured on their insurance policy and should not be held liable for the City's own negligence.

  The City of Santa Clarita opposes the motion, arguing that Tobo's insurers denied coverage and that Tobo is still obligated to indemnify the City under the contract. The City further argues that the claim is based on Tobo's negligence, not the City's, and that the statutory limitations on indemnity for active negligence do not apply.

  The Judge denies Tobo's motion. The Judge finds that there are triable issues of fact regarding Tobo's duty to indemnify the City under the contract, particularly in light of the insurers' denial of coverage and the lack of evidence supporting a claim of active negligence by the City. The Judge will consider the existing contractual indemnity language. The Court will consider the duty of Tobo to arrange for the designation of the City of Santa Clarita as an additional insured, but said proof of insurance only establishes compliance with one provision of the agreement.

  The Judge also continues the hearing date for a separate motion for summary judgment filed by the City of Santa Clarita to October 12, 2023. The final status conference and jury trial dates remain as scheduled.

Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The judge *denied* Tobo Construction, Inc.'s motion for summary adjudication. Tobo argued it had fulfilled its contractual obligation by naming the City of Santa Clarita as an additional insured on its insurance policy, and that the City couldn't seek indemnity for its own negligence. The City argued that there were still disputes about whether Tobo's insurance actually covered the City's claims and whether Tobo had a broader duty to indemnify the City. The judge found that there were *triable issues of material fact* regarding Tobo's duty to indemnify the City, particularly concerning the interpretation of Articles V and VIII of their contract and the denial of coverage by Tobo's insurers. The judge also noted that Tobo hadn't sufficiently shown that the City's claim was based on "active negligence," which would limit the City's ability to seek indemnity. Therefore the judge found Tobo had not fullfilled its obligations. The motion for summary judgment was denied, and the case will proceed. The City of Santa Clarita's separate motion for Summary Judgement was postponed.
