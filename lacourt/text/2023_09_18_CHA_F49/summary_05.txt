**English Summary:**

This tentative ruling addresses a motion by Defendant Amy Renteria to vacate a default judgment for unlawful detainer entered against her.  

The Judge finds that Renteria did not receive adequate notice of case management conferences leading to the default, but she does not demonstrate sufficient grounds for relief under the specific legal provisions addressing lack of notice. However, the Judge considers Renteria's request for relief based on mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.

While Renteria claims confusion regarding the scheduling of appearances, the Judge finds this explanation lacking and insufficient to warrant relief.  The Judge also declines to grant equitable relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 1174 due to the absence of any hardship demonstrated by Renteria.

Therefore, the Judge vacates the default judgment and stays the writ of possession, contingent upon Renteria paying the outstanding rent of $25,190 within 5 days. The case will proceed to a trial to determine the ongoing validity of the lease and the parties' respective rights and obligations.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to vacate the default judgment for unlawful detainer. The defendant, Amy Renteria, claims that she did not receive actual notice of two case management conferences, which led to her non-appearance and the subsequent default judgment. The court finds that the defendant's declaration is vague and lacks support for her claims of lack of notice. However, the court considers the discretionary standard for relief and grants the motion.

The court orders a stay of execution on the writ of possession contingent on full payment of the outstanding rent, which is $25,190. The default judgment and writ of possession are vacated, and the answer is restored. The court will set a trial date following the lapse of the compliance period.

The court assumes the existence of a month-to-month rental agreement and orders the parties to be restored to this agreement pending full payment of all outstanding rent. The plaintiff may not rely on the existing judgment for seeking possession of the premises and will need to seek a new judgment.

The court sets an order to show cause re: payment of rent and a trial date.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to vacate the default judgment in a case involving an unlawful detainer complaint. The defendant, Amy Renteria, had filed a motion to vacate the default judgment on the grounds of lack of actual notice of the case management conferences, mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect. The plaintiff, Shannaz Nermiarnian, had opposed the motion, arguing that service was proper and that the defendant had presented no valid basis for a finding of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.

The judge found that the default judgment was entered as a result of the defendant's failure to appear at the case management conferences, rather than a lack of service of the summons and complaint. The judge also found that the defendant's declaration in support of the motion was vague and lacking in support.

However, the judge did find that the defendant had demonstrated a willingness to pay the outstanding rent, and that the plaintiff had refused to communicate with the defendant. The judge therefore ordered a stay of execution on the writ of possession, contingent on the defendant's payment of the outstanding rent in full. The default judgment and writ of possession were vacated, and the defendant's answer was restored. The judge also set an Order to Show Cause (OSC) regarding payment of rent and a trial date.

summary text:
The Judge grants the motion to vacate the default judgment for unlawful detainer made by Defendant Amy Renteria. The Judge finds that the Defendant did not receive actual notice of the two case management conferences, leading to the non-appearance, striking of the answer, and default judgment. The Judge also cites the mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect standard for relief. However, the Judge finds no defects in the proofs of service provided by Plaintiff’s counsel. The Judge instead considers relief under mistake, inadvertence, and/or excusable neglect. The Judge finds the declaration of the Defendant vague and lacking in support. Therefore, the Judge considers the discretionary standard for relief based on the declaration of Defendant. The Judge orders a stay of execution on the writ of possession contingent on full payment of the outstanding rent. The default judgment and writ of possession are vacated. Defendant is given 5 days from the date of this order to pay the outstanding rent in full. Plaintiff is also ordered to pay any rent accumulated from the date of the judgment to the next rent due payment period. The court only stays execution of the judgment and therefore effectively vacates the default judgment. The answer is restored, and the court will set a trial date following the lapse of the compliance period. Plaintiffs may not rely on this existing judgment for seeking possession of the premises. Plaintiff will need to seek a new judgment. The court will set an OSC re: Payment of Rent and a Trial Date. Defendant is responsible for presenting proof of payment to the court in case of any challenge by Plaintiff regarding non-payment.

```

**Summary of Tentative Ruling:**

The Judge is inclined to grant Defendant Amy Renteria's motion to vacate the default judgment in the unlawful detainer case. Although the Judge finds no basis for relief based on lack of service, the court is considering relief based on excusable neglect and equitable considerations. The Judge acknowledges the Defendant's confusion regarding the case management conference dates. The Judge orders a stay of execution on the writ of possession and vacates the default judgment, contingent on the Defendant paying the full outstanding rent ($25,190) within 5 days, plus additional rent accumulated since the judgment. The Plaintiff will also need to seek a new judgment to obtain possession. The court will set an Order to Show Cause (OSC) regarding payment of rent and a trial date. The parties are restored to a month-to-month rental agreement, pending full payment of all outstanding rent.

**Summary of the Tentative Ruling:**

The judge granted the Defendant, Amy Renteria's, motion to vacate the default judgment in the unlawful detainer case.  Although the judge found no merit in Renteria's claims of lack of notice or improper service, the judge exercised equitable discretion.  The judge ordered a stay of execution on the writ of possession, *conditional* on Renteria paying *all* outstanding rent (as specified in the judgment, $25,190, plus any rent accumulated since the judgment) within five days of the order.  If Renteria pays the rent, the default judgment is vacated, her answer is reinstated, and a trial date will be set. If she fails to pay, the default judgment can be re-entered.  The parties are restored to a month-to-month tenancy, contingent on the rent payment. The Plaintiff cannot rely on the *existing* judgment for possession and must seek a *new* judgment if Renteria fails to pay or otherwise breaches the agreement. An Order to Show Cause (OSC) hearing will be set to confirm payment and schedule a trial.
