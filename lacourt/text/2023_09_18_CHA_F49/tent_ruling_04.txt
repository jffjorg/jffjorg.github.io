RESPONDING PARTY: Unopposed/ Defendant Carlos Lara, Pro
Per
 
RELIEF REQUESTED
Motion to Compel the Deposition of Defendant Carlos Lara
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
On January 18, 2021, plaintiff Jose Diaz agreed to loan
defendant Carlos Lara $40,000. The parties executed a written agreement.
Plaintiff alleges Defendant defaulted on the terms, and the entire balance
remains outstanding. 
 
On September 12, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint for
Recission, Fraud – Intentional Misrepresentation of Fact, Negligent
Misrepresentation, Unfair Competition (Business and Profession Code section
17200), Conversion, Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, and
Breach of Contract. Defendant, in pro per, filed a general denial on November
14, 2021.
 
RULING: Granted.
Plaintiff Jose Diaz moves to compel the deposition of defendant
Carlos Lara. The motion is unopposed. The court electronic filing system shows
no reply at the time of the tentative ruling publication cutoff.
 
A party
may file a motion to compel deposition upon a non-appearance of the noticed
party. “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action …
without having served a valid objection … fails to appear for examination, or
to proceed with it … the party giving the notice may move for an order
compelling the deponent's attendance and testimony…” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§2025.450, subd. (a).) A party must object to a deposition no less than three
calendar days before deposition date. (Code Civ. Proc., §2025.410, subd. (b).)
 
After
serving the notice of deposition and lacking any objections, Plaintiff held the
deposition, but Defendant failed to appear. [Declaration of Aldo Flores.] The
motion lacks an actual copy of any certificate of non-appearance. (See Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b).) The court finds the unopposed motion
sufficiently complies with procedural requirements. The motion is granted.
 
Defendant
Carlos Lara is ordered to appear for a deposition within 30 days of this order.
The court orders to meet and confer on a new deposition within 10 days of this
order. If the parties are unable to agree, due to the lack of cooperation or
communication by the deponent, and/or the deponent fails to appear again after
the setting of the date, Plaintiff may unilaterally pick a date. Plaintiff may attempt
to conduct the deposition, and take a subsequent notice of non-appearance, if
applicable. Any subsequent non-appearance may constitute grounds for an
evidentiary, issue or even terminating sanction (striking of the answer) in
favor of moving defendant. (Code Civ. Proc., §2025.450, subd. (h).)
 
Sanctions
entered against Carlos Lara, in pro per, for $250. (Code Civ. Proc., §2025.450,
subd. (g).) Payable within 30 days.
 
Motion
to Compel Compliance with Deposition Subpoena and Case Management Conference
set for September 19, and December 6, 2023, respectively.
 
Moving party to give notice.
