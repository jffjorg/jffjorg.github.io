**English Summary:**

This tentative ruling pertains to a case filed by Evelyn Gallegos against the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and Principal Luis Lopez. Gallegos alleges bullying by fellow students and LAUSD's failure to address it, culminating in a violent incident in March 2020.

The court has previously sustained demurrers and overruled others related to Gallegos' claims.  

Currently, LAUSD has moved to deem admissions admitted because Gallegos failed to respond to their Request for Admissions served on May 26, 2023. Since there was no opposition to the motion and no response filed, the court grants the motion. 

As a result, the admissions in the Request for Admissions are deemed admitted.  Because Gallegos, a minor, did not respond, the court imposes $25 in sanctions against her guardian ad litem, Karen Gallegos.

summary_text: |
  The Judge granted the Defendant's (Los Angeles Unified School District) motion to deem their Request for Admissions as admitted against the Plaintiff (Evelyn Gallegos) because the Plaintiff, who is now self-represented, failed to respond to the discovery request.  The Judge found that the discovery was properly served.  Because the motion was unopposed and no responses were provided, the Judge also imposed mandatory sanctions of $25 against Karen Gallegos, Evelyn's guardian ad litem, payable in 175 days. The ruling effectively establishes certain facts as true for the case, based on the unanswered admissions. LAUSD is responsible for providing notice of the ruling. There are related motions scheduled in the near future.

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the Los Angeles Unified School District's (LAUSD) motion to deem certain admissions admitted against Plaintiff Evelyn Gallegos. The LAUSD had served Gallegos with a Request for Admissions on May 26, 2023, and since she did not respond, the motion to deem the admissions admitted was granted. Because Gallegos, who is a minor, did not respond to the request for admissions, the court is imposing a $25 sanction on her guardian ad litem, Karen Gallegos. The case is scheduled for trial in February 2024.
