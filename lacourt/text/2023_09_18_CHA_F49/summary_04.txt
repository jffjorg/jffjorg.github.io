And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of defendant Carlos Lara. The plaintiff loaned $40,000 to the defendant, who defaulted on the loan. The plaintiff filed a complaint alleging various causes of action, including breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, conversion, fraud, and unfair competition. The defendant failed to appear for the deposition, despite being served with a notice of deposition. The court finds that the plaintiff's motion is sufficient and grants the motion, ordering the defendant to appear for a deposition within 30 days. The court also orders the parties to meet and confer on a new deposition date and warns that any further failure to appear may result in sanctions, including striking of the defendant's answer.
