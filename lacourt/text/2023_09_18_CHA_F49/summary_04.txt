## English Text Summary

In this case, Jose Diaz is suing Carlos Lara for failing to repay a $40,000 loan. Diaz filed a lawsuit alleging breach of contract and other claims.  Diaz then moved to compel Lara's deposition, as Lara did not appear for a previously scheduled deposition.  The judge granted Diaz's motion and ordered Lara to appear for a deposition within 30 days. Lara was also ordered to meet and confer with Diaz to schedule the deposition.  If Lara fails to appear again, he may face further sanctions, including the possibility of having his answer to the lawsuit stricken. Finally, the judge imposed a $250 sanction on Lara for his failure to appear at the initial deposition.
