And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a demurrer filed by the City of Hawthorne, which challenges the sufficiency of the allegations in the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by the plaintiffs, CARLOS LEON, Eva Leon, and T.L. (minor by and through guardian ad litem Eva Leon).

The judge has sustained the demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiffs must re-file their complaint with additional allegations to address the deficiencies identified by the judge.

The judge has also granted the City's motion to strike certain paragraphs of the FAC, which alleged that the City had prior notice of similar incidents on El Segundo Blvd. and failed to take measures to alleviate the dangerous condition.

The judge's ruling is based on the lack of specificity and particularity in the plaintiffs' allegations, as well as the failure to establish a causal relationship between the physical condition of the public property and the third-party conduct alleged to have contributed to the incident. The judge has also ruled that the City is immune from liability for the failure to provide traffic or warning signals, signs, markings, or devices.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any opposition filed by the parties and the court's subsequent review of the matter.
