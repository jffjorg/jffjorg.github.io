And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to intervene filed by National Continental Insurance Company (National) on behalf of defendants Jose Fuentes Vega and Alcocer, Inc. National is the liability insurer for the defendants and has a real, immediate, and concrete interest in the litigation. The court granted the motion to intervene because National meets the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure §387(d), which allows a non-party to intervene in an action if they have an interest in the property or transaction that is the subject of the action and are so situated that the disposition of the action may impair or impede their ability to protect that interest. The court finds that National has met its burden under CCP §387(d) and that its interest is not adequately represented by its insured. The motion is granted, and National is ordered to file its complaint-in-intervention within five days.
