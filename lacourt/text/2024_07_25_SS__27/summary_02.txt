And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel initial responses and requests for sanctions. The defendant, Brizuela Trucking, served discovery requests on the plaintiffs, Mehdi Rassouli Pour Khameneh et al., on March 20, 2024, but the plaintiffs failed to provide verified responses. The defendant requested verifications on May 8, 2024, but the plaintiffs did not provide them despite multiple extensions. The court finds that the plaintiffs' responses were insufficient and that the defendant is entitled to sanctions. The court orders the plaintiffs to provide code-compliant verifications to the responses at issue within 30 days. The court also sanctions the plaintiffs in the amount of $1,700 for their failure to comply with the discovery requests.
