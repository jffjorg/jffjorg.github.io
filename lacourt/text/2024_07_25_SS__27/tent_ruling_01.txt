MOTION TO DISMISS 
Hearing Date: 7/25/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 18STCV00258 MERCED MALDONADO vs
BARRETT WISSMAN, et al.
Moving Party: Defendants Barrett Wissman and
Nina Wissman 
Responding Party: Plaintiff¿ 
Notice: Sufficient¿ 
Ruling: MOTION TO DISMISS IS DENIED
 
Background
On October 10, 2018,
Plaintiff filed the present case. Since then, Plaintiff has attempted to serve
Defendants numerous times, but each attempt was met with a motion to quash. On
August 29, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s Application for Publication.
Defendants filed two motions to quash Plaintiff’s service through publication,
but both were denied, and Defendants are now deemed to have been served.
Instead of filing a responsive pleading, Defendants now move the Court to
dismiss the case on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to bring the case to
trial within five years under CCP § 583.310 and failed to serve Defendants
within three years pursuant to CCP § 583.210.
Legal Standard
5-Year Requirement to
Bring a Case to Trial
A civil action shall be
dismissed by the Court on its own motion or Defendant’s motion, after notice to
the parties, if it is not brought to trial within five years after it is
commenced against Defendant. (CCP §§ 583.310, 583.360(a).) Dismissal of an action
pursuant to § 583.360 is mandatory in the sense that the Court is without
discretion to refuse dismissal unless Plaintiff can establish an extension,
excuse, or exception expressly provided by statute. (CCP § 583.360(b).)
An exception exists
under CCP § 583.340 where, in computing the time within which an action must be
brought to trial, there shall be excluded the time during which:
(a) The jurisdiction of
the court to try the action was suspended.
(b) Prosecution or
trial of the action was stayed or enjoined.
(c) Bringing the action
to trial, for any other reason, was impossible, impracticable, or futile.
"What is
impossible, impracticable, or futile must be determined in light of all the
circumstances in the individual case, including the acts and conduct of the
parties and the nature of the proceedings themselves. [Citation.] The critical
factor in applying these exceptions to a given factual situation is whether
Plaintiff exercised reasonable diligence in prosecuting his or her case."
(Lazelle v. Lovelady (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 34, 38.) Because the purpose
of the dismissal statute is to prevent avoidable delay, this exception makes
allowance for circumstances beyond Plaintiff’s control. (Jordan v. Superstar
Sandcars (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 1416.)
3-Year Requirement to
Serve Defendant
Under CCP § 583.210(a),
the summons and complaint shall be served upon Defendant within three years
after the action is commenced against Defendant.
Under CCP § 583.240, in
computing the time within which service must be made, there shall be excluded
the time during which any of the following conditions existed:
(a) Defendant was not
amenable to the process of the court.
(b) The prosecution of
the action or proceedings in the action was stayed and the stay affected
service.
(c) The validity of
service was the subject of litigation by the parties.
(d) Service, for any
other reason, was impossible, impracticable, or futile due to causes beyond
Plaintiff's control. Failure to discover relevant facts or evidence is not a
cause beyond Plaintiff's control for the purpose of this subdivision.
Discussion
Under both CCP §
583.210(a) and § 583.310, exceptions exist for situations where service or
bringing the case to trial is impossible, impracticable, or futile due to
causes beyond Plaintiff's control. The critical factor in applying these
exceptions is whether Plaintiff exercised reasonable diligence in prosecuting the
case. (Lazelle v. Lovelady (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 34, 38.) A
determination of Plaintiff’s reasonable diligence in prosecuting the case or
serving Defendants has already been made by the Court on numerous occasions. On
June 10, 2024, the Court stated, “Since filing the complaint in October 2018,
Plaintiff made the following attempts to serve Defendants through other means
before applying for service by publication:
1. December 15-18,
2018: Attempted service at 3503 Springbrook St, Dallas, TX 75205, based on
Defendants' address listed in the Lexis database. 
2. After unsuccessful
initial service, Plaintiff retained USA Express Legal & Investigative
Services to locate and serve the Defendants. 
3. April 9-10, 2019:
Attempted substituted service at 3333 Lee Parkway, Suite 600, Dallas, TX 75219.
The company report for W Holdings, L.C, where Defendant Barrett Wissman is an owner/officer,
shows 3333 Lee Parkway, Suite 600 as its office location from 20I 7-2022, yet
Defendant filed a conflicting declaration stating he never worked at that
location. 
4. February 10, 2020:
Service attempted at 1601 Elm Street, Suite 4000, Dallas, TX 7520 I at 4:37 PM.
5. March 19, 2020: New
address attempted at 4220 Herschel Avenue, Unit 612, Dallas, TX 75219 during
the Texas COYID-19 lockdown; no contact was made, leading to service by certificate
of mail with return receipt requested. 
6. August 4-7, 2020:
Multiple service attempts by Process Server Stephen C. Buskirk at 4220 Herschel
Avenue, Unit 612, Dallas, TX 75219.
7. The investigative
agency conducted a skip trace and database search that did not reveal any other
current addresses, no utilities were registered nationwide; no records found
with Voters Registry; no records of Real Properly Nationwide for Defendants. 
Plaintiff attempted for
three years to serve Defendants at five different locations, employing
professional investigative agencies and conducting exhaustive searches for Defendants'
addresses through several databases when Defendants were living in the United States
and prior to them allegedly moving to Europe. They even tracked them to and
tried to serve them in Italy, albeit unsuccessfully. (see April 15, 2022
minute order on Fourth Motion to Quash). The standard is reasonable diligence,
not an indefinite global pursuit of the Defendants. The Court finds, as did the
Court (through a different judicial officer) when it approved the application
for service by publication, that Plaintiff has exercised reasonable diligence
prior to attempting service by publication.” (6/10/24 Minute Order.)
After Plaintiff
acquired an order for service through publication, Defendants filed a motion to
quash on October 16, 2023. When that motion was denied, Defendants renewed their
motion to quash on January 10, 2024. The Court denied that motion on June 10,
2024. Now, Defendants seek to dismiss the action based on Plaintiff’s alleged
delay.  However, the sequence of events
before and after Plaintiff’s request for service through publication showed
that Plaintiff was diligent in prosecuting the case. Plaintiff made multiple
attempts to serve Defendants before applying for service through publication
and actively litigated the validity of Plaintiff’s service throughout the
lifespan of the case. Thus, the present motion is DENIED; the time Plaintiff
spent trying to effect service and the time the parties spent litigating
service are excluded in computing the time in which service must be made or an
action must be brought to trial.
Defendants are ordered
to file a responsive pleading within 30 days of today.
