Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further discovery responses in part and denies it in part. The judge orders the defendant to provide code-compliant responses to the requests that were granted in the analysis within 30 days. The plaintiff requested attorney fees in the amount of $2,310.00, but the judge reduced the sanction to $1500 for both motions. The judge finds that the defendant did not fully act with substantial justification and forced the plaintiff to file the motions. The judge also reduces the sanction to $1500 for both motions. The defendant and its counsel are ordered to pay, jointly and severally, sanctions of $1500 to the plaintiff within 30 days.
