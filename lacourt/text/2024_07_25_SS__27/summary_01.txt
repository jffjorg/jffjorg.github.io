And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rules that the defendants' motion to dismiss the case is denied. The plaintiff has exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to serve the defendants, making multiple attempts to serve them before applying for service by publication. The defendants argue that the plaintiff has failed to bring the case to trial within five years under CCP § 583.310 and failed to serve them within three years under CCP § 583.210(a). The judge finds that the plaintiff has met the exceptions under CCP § 583.340 and CCP § 583.240, where service or bringing the case to trial is impossible, impracticable, or futile due to causes beyond the plaintiff's control. The judge orders the defendants to file a responsive pleading within 30 days of today.
