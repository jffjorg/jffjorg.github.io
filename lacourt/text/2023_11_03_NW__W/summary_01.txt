And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on defendant Alejandro Hugo Navarro's motion to strike punitive damages from plaintiff Araz Arabian's complaint. The motion is granted, with leave to amend. The complaint fails to allege facts warranting the award of punitive damages, as it does not specify the level of defendant's intoxication or any "aggravating factors" that would show a conscious disregard for the safety of others. The complaint alleges that defendant was intoxicated at the time of the accident, admitted to drinking and driving, and was arrested for driving under the influence, but these allegations alone do not rise to the level described by Taylor and Dawes. The court finds that the complaint does not state a prima facie claim for punitive damages and grants the motion to strike, allowing the plaintiff to amend the complaint if they can plead additional facts that support a claim for punitive damages.
