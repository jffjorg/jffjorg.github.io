Code §§ 528.5, 529, and (4) declaratory relief.Arseneva now seeks $3,000 in attorneys’ fees as sanctions for being forced to file a motion to deem requests for admission admitted, which was denied on September 8, 2023, because responses were ultimately served by Zambrano Law Corporation.  Arseneva claims the Court’s ruling was “without prejudice” with respect to her request for sanctions, although the only proof of this is her own notice of ruling, which is not even on the docket.  There being no opposition, the Court awards reduced sanctions in the amount of $1,200.
