And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to stay the matter pending the outcome of the plaintiff's appeal. The plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) alleged various causes of action, including breach of contract, breach of third party contract, and fraud, among others. The court previously sustained a demurrer filed by the defendants without leave to amend, and the plaintiff has since appealed that ruling. The defendant Katie Little sought to stay the matter pending the outcome of the appeal, but failed to provide sufficient explanation for why this is necessary or how it relates to her as a defendant. As a result, the motion is denied.
