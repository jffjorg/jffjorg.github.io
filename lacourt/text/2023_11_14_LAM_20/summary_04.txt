And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Shenika Dailey v. Southern California Healthcare System, Inc. The Defendant has moved for summary judgment or summary adjudication, arguing that the Plaintiff cannot prove medical negligence and that nothing done by the Defendant or its employees caused or contributed to the Plaintiff's injuries. The Judge has applied the three-step analysis for reviewing a motion for summary judgment or adjudication, and has determined that the Defendant has made a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue. The Plaintiff has not filed a substantive opposition to the motion, and therefore the motion is granted. The Judge notes that the law favors liberally construing the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment, and resolves any doubts in favor of the Plaintiff.
