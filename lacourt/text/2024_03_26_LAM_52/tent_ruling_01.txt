  Case Number:  21STCV26273    Hearing Date:   March 26, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Glaser Weil’s
Motion to Compel Deposition of Defendant Shlomo Rechnitz and Request for
Sanctions
Plaintiff/cross-defendant
Glaser Weil Fink Howard Avchen & Shapiro LLP (Glaser Weil)
moves to compel the deposition of defendant/cross-complainant Shlomo Rechnitz.  One
may move to compel the deposition of a party who fails to appear and testify at
deposition “without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410.”  (CCP § 2025.450(a).)
            Rechnitz
concedes he failed to appear and testify at his deposition.  He argues doing so was justified because of
his medical condition.  Glaser Weil
challenges the credibility of Rechnitz’s statements regarding his
condition.  As a practical matter,
Rechnitz’s alleged condition may be a reasonable basis for not testifying, but it
is not a valid objection under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.410.  That section refers to objections to “a
deposition notice that does not comply with Article 2 (commencing with section
2025.210),” not for other reasons a party cannot testify at deposition.       
Rechnitz also argues his testimony is not critical
and Glaser Weil should depose other witnesses first.  Generally, a party to an action has the right to
decide when and in which order it conducts discovery.  “The plaintiff may serve a deposition notice
without leave of court on any date that is 20 days after the service of the
summons on, or appearance by, any defendant.” 
(CCP § 2025.210(b).)  A party who
seeks to delay his deposition “may promptly move for a protective order.”  (CCP § 2025.420(a).)  Rechnitz moved for a protective order on
March 14, the day after he filed his opposition to this motion.  Moving for a protective order over a month
after failing to appear and only after opposing a motion to compel deposition
is not prompt.  
Glaser Weil is entitled to an order compelling
Rechnitz’s deposition.             
Sanctions
Glaser Weil moves for $23,041.17 in sanctions
against Rechnitz.  “If a motion” to
compel deposition “is granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction … in
favor of the party who noticed the deposition and against the deponent or the
party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless the court finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (CCP § 2025.450(g)(1).)  
Glaser Weil’s request for monetary sanctions includes
$20,725 in attorney fees.  It cannot
recover those fees because it is a law firm representing itself.  “[L]aw firms and attorney litigants are
precluded from recovering attorney fees for self-representation.”  (Soni v. Wellmike Enterprise Co. Ltd.
(2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1477, 1488.) 
There is no exception for discovery sanctions.  (Kravitz v. Superior Court (2001) 91
Cal.App.4th 1015, 1020 [“a pro se lawyer cannot recover attorney’s fees as a
discovery sanction”]; see also Musaelian v. Adams (2009) 45 Cal.4th 512,
515 [under CCP § 128.7, courts cannot award “sanctions in the form of an award
of attorney fees to self-represented attorneys”].)  
Though another law firm, Nemecek & Cole, also
represents Glaser Weil in this action, its papers on this motion are signed
only by Joel N. Klevens and Alaina Bird of Glaser Weil.  Klevens’s declaration states the attorney
fees were for work by unidentified associates and himself.  (Klevens Decl., ¶¶ 15, 18, 21.)  Glaser Weil fails to show it incurred these
attorney fees for anything other than as a law firm representing itself.  
Even if Glaser Weil could recover attorney fees, the
court finds imposing sanctions for them would be unjust under the
circumstances.  Rechnitz presents
evidence he had valid reasons for not testifying at his deposition: a medical
condition causing “debilitating pain, which is currently
being treated with medication that affects [his] ability to process questions
and answer competently.”  (Rechnitz
Decl., ¶ 10.)  
Glaser
Weil is entitled to recover other reasonable expenses as a monetary
sanction.  Those other expenses total
$2,316.17: $1,120 for the court reporter, videographer, and transcript for the
deposition on January 30, 2024 (Klevens Decl., ¶ 15), another $1,120 for the
deposition on February 8, 2024 (id., ¶ 18), and $76.17 “for hearing
reservation and filing fees” (id., ¶ 21).  It is
just to impose $2,316.17 in sanctions against Rechnitz.  If not, Glaser Weil would bear those
expenses.  Rechnitz may have had a valid
reason for not attending the depositions, but he is responsible for the
depositions not going forward.  Glaser
Weil did nothing to prevent the depositions.
