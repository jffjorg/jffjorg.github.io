And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to set aside the judgment in this action. The plaintiff, Frederick Wayne Smith, had asserted that extrinsic fraud, collusion, and perjury prevented him from fully participating in the proceeding. However, the judge found that the plaintiff had not shown any extrinsic fraud, and that the alleged frauds occurred long before the plaintiff brought this action. Additionally, the judge found that the plaintiff had not demonstrated diligence in seeking to set aside the dismissal, as he filed the motion over five years after the dismissal was entered. The judge also found that recent events, including the plaintiff's discovery of new information about his property and his incarceration, were not relevant to vacating the judgment of dismissal. The motion is therefore denied.
