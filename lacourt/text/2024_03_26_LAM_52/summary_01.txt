Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The court is considering a motion to compel the deposition of defendant Shlomo Rechnitz and a request for sanctions. The plaintiff, Glaser Weil, argues that Rechnitz failed to appear and testify at his deposition, and that this failure justifies compelling his deposition. Rechnitz claims that his medical condition prevented him from attending the deposition, but Glaser Weil challenges the credibility of his statements. The court finds that Rechnitz's alleged medical condition may be a reasonable basis for not testifying, but it is not a valid objection under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.410.

The court grants Glaser Weil's motion to compel Rechnitz's deposition and orders Rechnitz to attend and testify at a deposition within 20 days. The court also awards Glaser Weil $2,316.17 in sanctions, which includes the cost of the court reporter, videographer, and transcript for the deposition on January 30, 2024, and another $1,120 for the deposition on February 8, 2024. The court finds that imposing sanctions for attorney fees would be unjust under the circumstances.
