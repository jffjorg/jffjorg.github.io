And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, County of Los Angeles, has moved for summary judgment or summary adjudication on both of plaintiff David Smith's causes of action. The court has reviewed the evidence and finds that triable issues of fact preclude summary adjudication of both causes of action.

On the first cause of action, failure to engage in an interactive process, the court finds that plaintiff's evidence shows that he complained to Captain Tauscher about the stress of the Watch Commander assignment and requested reassignment to a different Lieutenant assignment. While defendant argues that it had no duty to engage in the interactive process until late 2021, the court cannot make that finding as a matter of law. A reasonable trier of fact could conclude that defendant's counseling was insufficient to satisfy its duty to engage in the interactive process.

On the second cause of action, failure to provide reasonable accommodation, the court finds that plaintiff's evidence presents triable issues on whether defendant's accommodation was reasonable. While defendant argues that plaintiff sought to eliminate essential functions of his job, the court cannot make that finding as a matter of law. A reasonable trier of fact could conclude that serving as a full-time Watch Commander was not an essential function and that plaintiff was qualified to periodically cover that assignment.

Given the existence of triable issues of fact, the court denies defendant's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication.
