COURT’S [TENTATIVE] RULING RE: 
Confirm
  Arbitration Award



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: THE MOTION IS
DENIED. This Motion, which was filed on March 5, 2024 was filed and served only
five days after the date the Award was served on Plaintiff. Per California Code
of Civil Procedure section 1288.4, Defendant must wait at least ten days after
February 29, 2024 to file and serve such a motion.
 
 
I. BACKGROUND
On July 19, 2021,
plaintiff Azalea Zamora (“Plaintiff’) and defendant WHN, Inc., dba Porsche
Woodland Hills (the “Dealer”) entered into a sale agreement (the “Agreement”)
whereby Plaintiff purchased a used vehicle from the Dealer. (Motion p. 2.)
 
On March 8, 2022,
Plaintiff initiated this lawsuit by filing a complaint against the Dealer and
defendant Mercedes-Benz U.S.A., LLC (“Defendant”) alleging causes of action for
breaches of express and implied warranties under the Song-Beverley Consumer Warranty
Act and for negligence. 
 
On April 11, 2022,
Defendant moved to compel arbitration, which motion was granted on June 21,
2022.
 
On February 29,
2024, the arbitrator granted summary judgment to Defendant on all of
Plaintiff’s claims and rendered a final award (the “Award”) in favor of
Defendant and against Plaintiff. (Motion
Attachment 8(c).)
 
On March 5, 2024,
Defendant filed a petition to confirm arbitration award (the “Motion”).
Plaintiff does not oppose the Motion.
 
II. MOVING PARTY’S POSITION
 
Defendant requests that the court confirm the Award and enter judgment
according to it.  (Motion p. 3.)
Defendant attaches to the Motion a copy of the Agreement, which includes a
provision to arbitrate “any claim or dispute between the parties which arises
out of or relates to credit application, purchase or condition of vehicle, [the
Agreement] or resulting transaction or relationship.” (Motion Attachment 4(b).)
Plaintiff alleged “violations of the Beverly-Song Consumer Warranty Act and the
Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.” (Motion p. 2.) Defendant attaches to the Motion a
copy of Award, which requires neither party to pay the other anything. (Motion
Attachment 8(c).)
 
III. ANALYSIS
 
“Any party to an
arbitration in which an award has been made may petition the court to confirm,
correct or vacate the award.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) Such a petition must
set forth the substance, or attach copies of: the arbitration agreement, award,
and any written opinion. (Id. at § 1285.4.) It must be served between
ten days and four years from the date the award was served on the petitioner. (Id.
at §§ 1288 & 1288.4.) The other party may respond to the petition. (Id.
at § 1285.2.) 
 
“If a petition or
response under this chapter is duly served and filed, the court shall confirm
the award as made, whether rendered in this state or another state, unless in
accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as
corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc.
§ 1286.) The court may not vacate or correct an award unless a
petition or response requesting that the award be vacated or corrected has been
duly served and filed. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1286.4 & 1286.8.) “If an award
is confirmed, judgment shall be entered in conformity therewith.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 1287.4.) 
 
Here, the Motion
correctly attached copies of the Agreement with the arbitration provision and
the Award. However, the Award was made and served on Plaintiff on February 29,
2024. This Motion, which was filed on March 5, 2024 was
therefore filed and served only five days after the date the Award was served
on Plaintiff. Per California Code of Civil Procedure section 1288.4, Defendant
must wait at least ten days after February 29, 2024 to file and serve such a
motion.
 
Accordingly, this
court DENIES the Motion.
