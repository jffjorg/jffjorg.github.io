Significant Statements:
  - "The defendant may, but need not, present evidence that conclusively negates an element of the plaintiff's cause of action."
  - "The plaintiff's deposition testimony that the plaintiff has no knowledge of any exposure to the defendant's products may be sufficient to shift the burden to the plaintiff to demonstrate the existence of triable issues of fact."
  - "If plaintiffs respond to comprehensive interrogatories seeking all known facts with boilerplate answers that restate their allegations, or simply provide laundry lists of people and/or documents, the burden of production will almost certainly be shifted to them once defendants move for summary judgment and properly present plaintiff's factually devoid discovery responses."
```

And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs, Justin Baylis, Garret Baylis, and Jennifer Galloway, filed an action against Jafra Cosmetics International, Inc. alleging that Lorie Baylis developed mesothelioma due to exposure to asbestos in the defendant's products. However, the plaintiffs did not provide sufficient evidence to support their claims, and their discovery responses were inadequate. The defendant served interrogatories, and the plaintiffs responded with insufficient evidence, including deposition testimony that lacked specific details. The judge found that the defendant had met its burden to conclusively negate a necessary element of the plaintiff's case, and therefore, the motion for summary judgment is granted. The defendant is ordered to file a proposed judgment within five days, and the moving party is to give notice.
