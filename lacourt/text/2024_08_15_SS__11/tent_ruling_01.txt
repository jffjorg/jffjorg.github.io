TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant’s objection numbers 1 through 11 are sustained.
 
Plaintiff’s second motion for class certification is denied.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a putative class action. 
The fourth amended complaint (“4AC”) is the operative complaint.  Plaintiff alleges that she and the putative
class members underwent outpatient surgeries at WHSC and that WHSC and West
Hills Hospital (“WHH”) disclosed their Personal Medical Health Information
(“PMHI”) to nonparty insurers and billing agencies without permission.  Plaintiff claims the alleged conduct violated
Civil Code section 56, the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (“CMIA”),
Business and Professions Code section 17200, the Unfair Competition Law
(“UCL”), and Civil Code section 1750, the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (“CLRA”).
 
On January 11, 2024, the Court heard Plaintiff’s first motion for class
certification.  In reply to the motion,
Plaintiff proposed two new classes.  The
Court denied the motion without prejudice and granted Plaintiff leave to amend
to add the new classes to the complaint.
 
On January 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed the 4AC.
 
On March 12, 2024, the Court overruled the demurrer as to WHSC and
sustained it with leave to amend as to WHH. 
Plaintiff ended up not amending.
 
At issue now is Plaintiff’s second motion for class certification.
 
DISCUSSION
 
The plaintiff bears the burden of
demonstrating that class certification is proper.  (See City of San Jose v. Superior Court
(1974) 12 Cal.3d 447, 460; see also Caro v. Procter & Gamble Co.
(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 644, 654.)  He or
she “must demonstrate the existence of an
ascertainable and sufficiently numerous class, a well-defined community of
interest, and substantial benefits from certification that render proceeding as
a class superior to the alternatives.”  (Brinker
Restaurant Corp. v. Superior Court (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1004, 1021.)
 
Ascertainable
Class
 
A class is “ascertainable when it is defined ‘in terms of objective
characteristics and common transactional facts’ that make ‘the ultimate
identification of class members possible when that identification becomes
necessary.’”  (Noel v. Thrifty
Payless, Inc. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 955, 980.)
 
“The
class must be ‘numerous’ in size.  But
there is no fixed minimum or maximum number . . . The numerosity analysis is
limited to how many individuals fall within the class definition and
whether their joinder is impracticable, not how many ‘net’ class members there
might be after considering affirmative defenses.” (Edmon & Karnow, Cal.
Practice Guide: Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2023 Update)
¶ 14:21, emphasis in original.)
 
“A party seeking class
certification bears the burden of satisfying the requirements of Code of Civil
Procedure section 382, including numerosity, and the trial court is entitled to
consider ‘the totality of the evidence in making [the] determination’ of
whether a ‘plaintiff has presented substantial evidence of the class action
requisites.’” (Soderstedt v. CBIZ S. California, LLC (2011) 197
Cal.App.4th 133, 154.)
 
The proposed class definition is
“[a]ll natural persons who obtained an outpatient surg[ery] at WHSC [and]
signed the Informed Consent[,] and WHSC subsequently disclosed their PMHI to an
insurer.”  (Motion, p. 6.)
 
Plaintiff asserts that the
proposed definition satisfies the Noel standard and that the putative
members “can be [] identified from WHSCs business records[.]”  (Id. at p. 11.)
 
The Court disagrees.  The proposed definition is overbroad in that
it includes patients subject to CMIA exceptions.  (See Opposition, pp. 21-22.)  Moreover, Plaintiff lacks evidence.  She cites paragraph 9 of her declaration and
exhibit 2 of her attorney’s declaration. 
(See id. at pp. 11-12.)  Both
declarations were unsigned when she filed them with the moving papers, which
made them inadmissible.  On July 3, 2024,
she filed a notice of errata, stating that she would be concurrently filing
signed versions.  (See 7/3/24 Notice of
Errata, p. 1.)  It did not happen.  The signed versions appear on Case Anywhere,
but they are not posted on eCourt. 
Service via Case Anywhere is not a valid substitute for filing documents
in court, so Plaintiff fails to meet her burden.
 
As a matter of guidance,
paragraph 9 and exhibit 2 do not help. 
Paragraph 9 states: “All these consent forms were placed in my medical
record and became part of my permanent medical record.”  (Braun Decl., ¶ 9.)  Exhibit 2 is a deposition transcript.  Plaintiff cites pages 28 and 29.  (See Motion, p. 12.)  On those pages, WHSC’s person most
knowledgeable, Julie Hendricks, reads excerpts of documents in Plaintiff’s file
and says she is “[n]ot . . . aware of” “any financial disclosures missing from
[Plaintiff’s] record that are typically in another patient’s” file.  (Kalcheim Decl., Ex. 2, pp. 28-29.)  These statements do not show that WHSC’s
records can be used to identify the putative members.
 
Plaintiff’s reply brief cites
exhibit 2, pages 56 through 60.  (See
Reply, p. 6.)  On page 57, Hendricks
states that “the forms . . . in [Plaintiff’s] medical records” would also be in
the other patients’ files.  (Kalcheim
Decl., Ex. 2, p. 57.)  If the declaration
and exhibit 2 had been filed, the statement probably would suffice to show a
means of identification.
 
Yet Plaintiff also fails to show
numerosity.  She contends the class is
sufficiently numerous because WHSC performs 8,000 to 10,000 surgeries per
year.  (See Motion, p. 10.)  This evidence is off the mark.  The proposed class is not all people who had
surgeries.  (See Opposition, pp. 13-14.)
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied
because Plaintiff fails to demonstrate an ascertainable class.
 
Predominating Common
Questions
 
“[T]he proponent of certification
must show, inter alia, that questions
of law or fact common to the class predominate over the questions affecting the
individual members[.]” (Washington Mutual Bank, FA v. Superior Court
(2001) 24 Cal.4th 906, 913.) This means “each member must not be
required to individually litigate numerous and substantial questions to
determine his [or her] right to recover following the class judgment[.]”  (Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶
14:11.6.)  “[T]he issues which may be
jointly tried, when compared with those requiring separate adjudication, must
be sufficiently numerous and substantial to make the class action advantageous
to the judicial process and to the litigants.” (Ibid.)
 
The Court noted the following when it denied Plaintiff’s
first certification motion:
 
Plaintiff claims Defendants violated the
CMIA by disclosing PMHI to nonparty insurers and billing agencies without
permission.  The wrinkle is that
Plaintiff and the putative class members signed Informed Consent forms prior to
their surgeries.  [Citation.]  Defendants contend the Informed Consents
complied with the CMIA and had the effect of authorizing the alleged
disclosures.  [Citation.]  Plaintiff, of course, disagrees.  [Citation.]
 
An authorization must pass several
requirements to be compliant under the CMIA. 
[Citation.]  Compliance is a
merits issue.  Given that Defendants
concede that all putative class members signed WHSC’s standard Informed Consent
form [citation], the Court agrees with Plaintiff; whether the Informed Consents
complied is a common merits question. 
[Citation.]
 
The ultimate question, though, is
whether the compliance issue predominates over individual issues.  Arguably, the answer is no.  When the Court heard Plaintiff’s motion for
leave to amend in June 2023, the Court highlighted two exceptions to the CMIA’s
authorization mandate and found that Plaintiff’s allegations were good enough at
the pleading stage to get around the exceptions.  The certification stage is a different
story.  “The Court [probably] would need
to examine each [putative] class member’s medical and billing records to
ascertain[] (1) whether the medical information that WHSC provided to WHH was
necessary to treat or diagnose that patient’s medical condition” and “(2)
whether the patient’s payment prior to the procedure was a result of their insurance
coverage, meaning WHSC would still need to submit a claim to their insurer to
verify coverage after the procedure[.]” 
[Citation.]  Even assuming
Plaintiff is correct that the Informed Consents failed to meet the statutory
requirements, these issues would still have to be analyzed patient-by-patient
to determine whether the exceptions apply despite – and independent of – the
defective authorizations.  Individual
inquiries would be inevitable and arguably would predominate.
 
(1/12/24 Notice of Ruling on Plaintiff’s Motion for Class
Certification, Ex. A, p. 5, emphasis in original, footnotes omitted.)
 
Turning to the second certification motion, Plaintiff’s
showing fails.  The Court previously
highlighted two CMIA exceptions.  (See
1/12/24 Notice of Ruling on Plaintiff’s Motion for Class Certification, Ex. A,
pp. 5, 8-9 n.3.)   Defendant highlights a
third.  (See Opposition, p. 15 [citing
Civil Code section 56.10(c)(3)].)  To
show commonality, Plaintiff cites Hendricks’s declaration, paragraph 16, and
Hendricks’s deposition transcript, pages 36:25 through 37.1.  (See Reply, pp. 9-11)  Paragraph 16 states:
 
Like nearly all medical providers, WHSC
regularly and routinely discloses patient information to insurers for the
purpose of obtaining an authorization for the healthcare services that the
patients’ physicians deem medically necessary. 
Insurers typically require providers to submit requests for
authorization for non-emergency medical care and will often only agree to pay
for such care if the provider obtains an authorization and the insurer determines
that the planned care is medically necessary. 
Providers can seek requests for authorization both before and after a
procedure is provided.  WHSC submits
thousands of authorization requests per year.
 
(Hendricks Decl., ¶ 16.) 
Pages 36:25 through 37.1 state: “MR. KALCHEIM: Amanda, we haven’t seen,
I don’t believe we’ve seen any of this – any[.]”  (Kalcheim Decl., Ex. 2, pp. 36:25-37.1.)  Neither statement addresses the CMIA
exceptions nor shows that they can be analyzed on a classwide basis.  The rationale pertaining to the first
certification motion applies with equal force here.
 
What about an issue class? 
Whether the Informed Consents complied with the CMIA remains a common
merits question.  The Court has discretion
to certify an issue class to resolve the compliance issue.  (See, e.g., Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.765;
see also, e.g., Sarun v. Dignity Health (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th
1119, 1123).   Indeed, during the last
demurrer round, the Court found the Informed Consents ambiguous.  (See 3/12/24 Ruling Re: Demurrer, pp. 6-8,
9.)  An issue class could be utilized to
interpret the Informed Consents.
 
Defendant claims the Court “would
need to analyze and provisionally accept extrinsic evidence regarding each
individual class member’s interpretation of the Informed Consent[.]”  (Opposition, pp. 16-17, emphasis
deleted.)  
 
The Court tends to disagree.  The Informed Consents’ wording is uniform,
Defendant drafted them, and there is no evidence indicating that any patient
took part in the drafting process.  At
this point, it appears that the patients’ subjective beliefs about the meaning
of the words would have little to no bearing on the interpretation
question.    
 
Nevertheless, the Court believes
an issue class would be inefficient. 
Again, “[e]ven assuming Plaintiff is correct that the Informed Consents
failed to meet the statutory requirements,” liability would still depend on
“whether the exceptions apply despite – and independent of – the defective
authorizations.”  (1/12/24 Notice of Ruling on Plaintiff’s Motion for
Class Certification, Ex. A, p. 5.)  Mini-trials
would have to be held to assess the exceptions’ applicability.  (Ibid.)
 
The motion is denied because individual issues predominate.
 
Typical Class
Representative
 
“The ‘test
of typicality is whether other members have the same or similar injury, whether
the action is based on conduct which is not unique to the named plaintiffs, and
whether other class members have been injured by the same course of conduct.’”  (Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 14:29
[quoting Martinez v. Joe’s Crab Shack Holdings (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th
362, 375].)
 
“That
the purported class representative's claims must be ‘typical’ does not mean
they must be identical to the claims of other class members.  It is sufficient that the representative is
similarly situated so that he or she will have the motive to litigate on behalf
of all class members.”  (Id. at ¶
14:29.2.)  “Thus, it is not necessary
that the class representative have personally incurred all of the
damages suffered by each of the other class members.”  (Ibid., emphasis in original.)
 
However,
the class representative’s claim is atypical “if it is subject to ‘factually
intensive or legally complex unique defenses that pose any significant risk
of diverting [plaintiff’s] attention from class
issues.’”  (Id. at ¶ 14:35.10 [citing Fireside
Bank v. Superior Court (2007) 40 Cal.4th 1069] emphasis in
original.)
 
Defendant
contends Plaintiff is atypical because her insurer did not pay her medical
bills.  (See Opposition, pp. 6, 22-23
[claiming most patients’ insurers made payments to WHSC].)
 
Given
the preceding analysis, the Court declines to reach this prong.
 
Adequate
Representation
 
“The
class representative, through qualified counsel, must be capable of ‘vigorously
and tenaciously’ protecting the interests of the class members.”  (Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 14:36.)
 
“The
prospective class representative must file a declaration stating that he or she
desires to represent the class and understands the fiduciary obligations of
serving as class representative.  Counsel’s
declaration to that effect will not suffice.” 
(Ibid.)
 
This
prong is unopposed.  (See Opposition, pp.
5-23.)
 
Plaintiff’s
showing is inadequate.  To repeat,
Plaintiff and her counsel failed to file their declarations.  The record lacks evidence.
 
Manageable
and Superior
 
“The
proponent of class certification must demonstrate that the proposed class
action is manageable [citation].”  (Edmon
& Karnow, supra, at ¶ 14:11.10.)  “This
requires the trial court ‘to carefully weigh the respective benefits and
burdens of a class action, and to permit its maintenance only where
substantial benefits will be accrued by both litigants and the courts alike.’  [Citation.]” 
(Ibid., emphasis in original.)  
 
“In certifying a class action,
the court must also conclude that litigation of individual issues, including
those arising from affirmative defenses, can be managed fairly and
efficiently.”  (Duran v. U.S. Bank
Nat. Assn. (2014) 59 Cal. 4th 1, 28-29.) 
“Trial courts must pay careful attention to manageability when deciding
whether to certify a class action.  In
considering whether a class action is a superior device for resolving a
controversy, the manageability of individual issues is just as important as the
existence of common questions uniting the proposed class.”  (Id. at 29.)
 
“A class action is not ‘superior’ where there are numerous and substantial questions affecting each class
member's right to recover, following determination of liability to the class as
a whole.”  (Edmon & Karnow, supra, at
¶ 14:46, emphasis in original.)
 
The Court finds Plaintiff’s
burden unsatisfied.  Plaintiff’s briefs
fail to cite evidence (see Motion, pp. 19-20; see also Reply, pp. 5-12), she
and her counsel failed to file their declarations, and she failed to file a
trial plan.  Also, the class method is
inferior since individual issues predominate.

Tentative Ruling Re: Motion to Seal
 
Date:                           8/15/24

________________________________________________________________________
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
The hearing on WHSC’s motion to seal is continued.
 
BACKGROUND
 
In opposition to Plaintiff’s second motion for class certification, WHSC
filed an opposition brief and numerous exhibits.  
 
Here, WHSC moves to seal portions of the opposition brief and exhibits.
 
LAW
 
The court may order that a record be filed under seal only if
it expressly finds facts that establish: 
 
(1)  
There exists an
overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record;
 
(2)  
The overriding
interest supports sealing the record; 
 
(3)  
A substantial
probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the
record is not sealed; 
 
(4)  
The proposed sealing
is narrowly tailored; and 
 
(5)  
No less restrictive
means exist to achieve the overriding interest.
 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.550(d).) “These findings embody constitutional requirements for a request to seal court records, protecting
the First Amendment right of public access to civil trials.  (Edmon
& Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter
Group June 2023 Update) ¶ 9:418, emphasis in original.) 
 
The
parties’ agreement to seal documents is not enough to support a motion to
seal.  (Id. at ¶ 9:417.1 [“Parties
sometimes operate under an informal arrangement pursuant to which documents are
‘deemed filed under seal’ unless an objection is made.  Such an arrangement ‘is entirely inconsistent
with the mandatory requirements of rules 2.550 and 2.551 and the constitutional
values informing those requirements.’”].)
 
“Only
the specific words of documents that constitute the sensitive material should
be sealed; generally, it is not permissible to seal the entire document.”  (Id. at ¶ 9:418.5.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
The
Court finds that the hearing should be continued.  WHSC’s notice and moving brief fail to
identify the specific portions that WHSC seeks to seal.  Defense counsel states that, “[c]oncurrent
with” the motion to seal, WHSC filed redacted versions of the opposition brief
and exhibits.  (Fuller Decl., ¶ 4.)  Counsel contends the “redactions demonstrate
that the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored[.]”  (Ibid.) 
However, it is not the Court’s job to hunt through the opposition brief
and exhibits to find the redactions and to compare the redacted versions to the
unredacted versions to figure out what the redacted words are.  WHSC is required to give Plaintiff and the
Court clear notice of the lines, pages, and documents it wants to seal.  The hearing is continued to give WHSC an
opportunity to fix this defect.

TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s motion to seal is granted in part and denied in part.
 
BACKGROUND
 
In opposition to Plaintiff’s first motion for class certification, West
Hills Surgical Center and West Hills Hospital (collectively “Defendants”) filed
numerous exhibits.  
 
Plaintiff moved to seal pages 2 through 7 of Defendants’ opposition brief
and all exhibits in Defendants’ appendix of evidence.
 
On January 11, 2024, the Court found Plaintiff’s sealing requests
overbroad and continued the matter to give Plaintiff a chance to submit revised
requests.
 
On January 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed her revised requests.
 
The question here is whether the revised requests should be granted.
 
LAW
 
The court may order that a record be filed under seal only if
it expressly finds facts that establish: 
 
(1)  
There exists an
overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record;
 
(2)  
The overriding
interest supports sealing the record; 
 
(3)  
A substantial
probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the
record is not sealed; 
 
(4)  
The proposed sealing
is narrowly tailored; and 
 
(5)  
No less restrictive
means exist to achieve the overriding interest.
 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.550(d).) “These findings embody constitutional requirements for a request to seal court records,
protecting the First Amendment right of public access to civil trials.  (Edmon
& Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter

The
parties’ agreement to seal documents is not enough to support a motion to
seal.  (Id. at ¶ 9:417.1 [“Parties

‘deemed filed under seal’ unless an objection is made.  Such an arrangement ‘is entirely inconsistent

“Only
the specific words of documents that constitute the sensitive material should
be sealed; generally, it is not permissible to seal the entire document.”  (Id. at ¶ 9:418.5.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
In
her revised requests, Plaintiff asks the Court to seal pages ii:4-8,
1:3, 1:5, 1:8-11, 2:25-28, 3:2-3, 3:5, 3:9-28, 4:1-11, 4:18-19, 4:22, 4:26,
5:7-8, 5:13, 5:16, 6:5, 7:17, 8:5, 11:24, 12:8, 14:9-24, 18:22, and 19:13-22 of
Defendants’ opposition brief and exhibits 1 through 19 of Defendants’ appendix
of exhibits.  (See Notice, pp. 2-3; see
also Motion, p. 5.)
 
Defendants’
Opposition Brief
 
The
Court finds that the revised requests should be granted in part and denied in
part.  Some of the pages reveal protected
medical information, but others state vague, nonspecific descriptions of
Plaintiff’s treatment and convey unprotected information – e.g., information
related to billing, disclosures, and Informed Consent forms. The protected
medical information meets the requirements of rule 2.550(d) and should be
sealed. The vague descriptions and unprotected information do not satisfy rule
2.550(d) and should not be sealed. 
Accordingly, the motion is: 
 
*
granted as to pages ii:8 (redact the name of the medical procedure),
2:25-28, 3:9-15, 3:18-23, 9:28 (redact the name of the medical procedure), 4:2
(redact the name of the medical procedure), 4:5 (redact the name of the medical
procedure), 4:19 (redact the name of the medical procedure), and 5:7 (redact
the name of the medical procedure); and  
 
* denied as to the rest.
 
Defendants’
Appendix of Evidence
 
The
motion is granted in part and denied in part. 
Among other documents, the exhibits include lab reports, Plaintiff’s
Informed Consent form, billing records, and multiple deposition transcripts.  Some of the documents contain protected
medical information throughout. Those documents should be sealed under rule
2.550(d).  Portions of other documents
(at least) contain unprotected information. 
Since sealing entire documents is usually inappropriate (see Edmon &
Karnow, supra, at ¶ 9:418.5), those documents should not be sealed.  Accordingly, the Court: 
 
*
grants the motion as to exhibits 1, 2 (redact the name of the medical
procedure), 3, 4 (redact Plaintiff’s address, phone number, and insurance ID
number), 5, 6, 7, 8 (redact the name of the medical procedure and Plaintiff’s
address and phone number), 10 (redact the name of the medical procedure and
Plaintiff’s address), 11 (redact the name of the medical procedure and
Plaintiff’s address), 12 (redact Plaintiff’s address and subscriber ID number),
14 (redact Plaintiff’s address), and 15 (redact Plaintiff’s insurance ID
number); and 
 
*
denies the motion as to the rest.[1]
