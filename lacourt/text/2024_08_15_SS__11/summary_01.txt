Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's second motion for class certification. The plaintiff alleges that West Hills Surgical Center (WHSC) and West Hills Hospital (WHH) disclosed personal medical health information (PMHI) without permission. The defendant claims that the Informed Consents signed by the plaintiff and putative class members comply with the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA).

The judge found that the proposed class definition is overbroad and fails to demonstrate an ascertainable class. The judge also found that the common questions do not predominate over individual issues, and individual issues would need to be analyzed on a patient-by-patient basis.

The judge granted the defendant's motion to seal certain documents and exhibits, but denied the plaintiff's motion to seal other documents and exhibits. The judge found that some documents contain protected medical information and should be sealed, while others contain unprotected information and should not be sealed.

The judge also continued the hearing on the defendant's motion to seal certain documents and exhibits, pending the defendant's revised request.
