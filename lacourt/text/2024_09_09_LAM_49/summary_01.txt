And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to transfer the action to Tulare County, where the bus accident occurred. The judge found that the action was not properly filed in Los Angeles County, as the defendant Pinkney is not a California resident and the corporate defendants are headquartered in Texas. The judge also found that the plaintiff's argument that the action should remain in Los Angeles County due to the convenience of witnesses was not persuasive, as the only relevant witness is defendant Pinkney, who is no longer a resident of California. The judge ordered the plaintiff to bear the costs and fees of transferring the action, and ordered the moving party to give notice. The judge did not award attorney's fees to the defendant, as the plaintiff's opposition to the motion was not entirely unreasonable.
