And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is a summary of the court's thoughts on the case before the hearing. The case is Williams v Astroturf Corporation et al, with a case number of 23STCV0848. The plaintiff, Mark Williams, a self-represented individual, alleges that the Astroturf Defendants conspired with the LAUSD to sabotage many fields and cost taxpayers millions of dollars. The Astroturf Defendants argue that Williams lacks standing to bring claims and that the claims are time-barred.

The court has already sustained the demurrer filed by the LAUSD Defendants in its entirety without leave to amend. The Astroturf Defendants have filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which the court has granted without leave to amend on the first, second, and third causes of action.

The court finds that the first cause of action, False Claims Act, fails because the complaint does not allege when or what false representations were made by the Astroturf Defendants. The second cause of action, Breach of Warranty, fails because Williams lacks standing to bring claims on behalf of Concerned Citizens and the claim is time-barred. The third cause of action, Inducing Breach of Contract, fails because Williams is unable to maintain this cause of action.

The court's tentative ruling grants the motion for judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend, dismissing the three causes of action.
