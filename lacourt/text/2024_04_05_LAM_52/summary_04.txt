And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Aaron Friedman's motion to lift the automatic stay of this action pending appeal. The stay was automatically imposed when defendant GR0.com, LLC perfected its appeal in December 2023. However, a new law (Code of Civil Procedure section 1294(a)) took effect on January 1, 2024, which provides that the perfecting of an appeal shall not automatically stay any proceedings in the trial court during the pendency of the appeal. The court finds that this statute operates prospectively, as it establishes rules for the conduct of pending litigation without changing the legal consequences of past conduct. Lifting the stay does not change the legal consequences of defendant's past conduct, and it does not retrospectively deprive defendant of the benefits of the former law. The court also declines to exercise its discretion to maintain the stay, as it would undermine the purpose of the amendment to Code of Civil Procedure section 1294(a).
