Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Inland Empire Health Plan's (IEHP) demurrer and motion to strike portions of the second amended complaint filed by plaintiffs Markeisha Cassidy-Dawson and Melrose D.-F. IEHP demurred to the two causes of action alleged in the complaint, arguing that they do not permit recovery of monetary damages and that the plaintiffs did not allege sufficient facts for injunctive relief. However, the judge has found that the second amended complaint adequately cures the latter defect by alleging that the plaintiffs desire to move to the Inland Empire but cannot due to fear of future discrimination by IEHP. The judge has therefore overruled IEHP's demurrer.

Regarding the motion to strike, the judge has found that IEHP's memorandum of points and authorities is defective and fails to comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113(b). The motion is therefore denied. The judge has ordered IEHP to answer the second amended complaint within 20 days.
