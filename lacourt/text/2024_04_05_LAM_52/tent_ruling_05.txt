 Case Number:  23STCV19198    Hearing Date:   April 5, 2024    Dept:  52 Defendant LAD-N, LLC dba Nissan of
Downtown LA’s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint or, in the Alternative,
to Strike Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint
            Defendant LAD-N, LLC doing business as Nissan of
Downtown LA moves to dismiss this action by plaintiff Ana Quintana under Code
of Civil Procedure section 581. 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (f)(2) provides, “The court may dismiss the complaint as to
that defendant when: [¶] (2) … after a demurrer to the complaint is sustained
with leave to amend, the plaintiff fails to amend it within the time allowed by
the court and either party moves for dismissal.”
On October 26, 2023, the court sustained defendant’s
demurrer to plaintiff’s entire complaint and permitted plaintiff 30 days’ leave
to amend.  Plaintiff did not amend the
complaint within the 30 days allowed. 
Plaintiff did not file a first amended complaint.  On February 1, 2024, plaintiff filed (but did
not serve on defendant) an “amendment to complaint” on form LASC CIV 105.  This form is used to substitute the true name
of a defendant formerly designated as a fictitious “Doe” defendant or to
correct a defendant’s name.  Even if that
filing constituted a first amended complaint, plaintiff did not file it within
the time permitted to amend the complaint. 
The court will therefore dismiss plaintiff’s complaint under Code of
Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (f)(2).  
Disposition
            Defendant LAD-N, LLC dba Nissan of Downtown LA’s motion to dismiss plaintiff’s
complaint is granted.  This
action by plaintiff Ana Quintana is hereby dismissed without prejudice.
