  Case Number:  20STCV13190    Hearing Date:   April 5, 2024    Dept:  52 Reeder McCreary, LLP’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel
for Defendant Hooman Nissani
Duncan J. McCreary of
Reeder McCreary, LLP moves to be relieved as counsel for defendant Hooman
Nissani.  The motion meets all
requirements under California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.
The court notes that Reeder
McCreary, LLP’s papers state the firm also can no longer represent the other
six defendants in this action.  But the
firm filed no motion to be relieved as counsel for those defendants.  It filed only a single motion to be relieved
as counsel for Hooman Nissani.
Reeder McCreary, LLP’s motion
to be relieved as counsel for defendant Hooman Nissani is granted.  The court will sign the proposed order on Judicial
Council form MC-053.  The order will be effective upon filing proof
of service of the signed order on defendant Hooman Nissani.
