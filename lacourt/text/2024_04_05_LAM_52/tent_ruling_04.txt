 Case Number:  23STCV17249    Hearing Date:   April 5, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Aaron Friedman’s Motion to
Lift Stay Pending Appeal 
Plaintiff Aaron Friedman moves to lift the stay of
this action pending appeal.  On November
30, 2023, the court denied defendant GR0.com, LLC’s motion to compel
arbitration of this action.  Defendant
perfected its appeal in December 2023. 
Doing so automatically stayed the action.  On January 1, 2024, a new law took
effect.  Code of Civil Procedure section
1294(a) now provides, “Notwithstanding Section 916, the perfecting of such an
appeal shall not automatically stay any proceedings in the trial court during
the pendency of the appeal.”
Plaintiff shows good cause to lift the automatic
stay.  There is a “presumption that
statutes operate prospectively absent a clear indication the voters or the
Legislature intended otherwise.”  (Californians
for Disability Rights v. Mervyn’s, LLC (2006) 39 Cal.4th 223, 230 (CDR).)  But “a statute that establishes rules for the
conduct of pending litigation without changing the legal consequences of past
conduct is not made retroactive merely because it draws upon facts existing
prior to its enactment... .  [Instead,]
[t]he effect of such statutes is actually prospective in nature since they
relate to the procedure to be followed in the future.”  (Id. at p. 231, internal quotes
omitted.)  
The “legal consequences of past conduct” generally
refers to matters such as expanding “liability for past conduct by imposing
broader duties,” imposing liability for something previously protected at the
time by “an immunity statute,” or increasing criminal punishments or defining
new conduct as criminal.  (CDR, supra,
39 Cal.4th at p. 231.)  In this context,
past conduct typically means the underlying events giving rise to the
litigation—not what happened earlier in the litigation.    
Statutes regarding an automatic stay pending appeal are
rules for the conduct of pending litigation. 
Undoing the automatic stay does not change the legal consequences of defendant’s
past conduct.  The new statute leaves “entirely
unchanged the substantive rules governing” the right to arbitrate and the legal
rights giving rise to plaintiff’s action against defendant.  (CDR, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 232.)  Moreover, applying Code of Civil Procedure
section 1294(a) now does not retrospectively deprive defendant of the benefits
of the former law.  This case has been
stayed pending the appeal.  Lifting that
stay now, pursuant to plaintiff’s noticed motion, does not retrospectively undo
the prior stay.  Lifting the stay “affect[s]
only future conduct—the future conduct of” this action.  (Elsner v. Uveges (2004) 34 Cal.4th
915, 936.)    
Defendant’s opposition also argues the court should exercise
its discretion to maintain the stay.  The
court declines to do so.  The purpose of
the amendment to Code of Civil Procedure section 1294(a) was to “give[] courts
the discretion to prevent corporations from using a common delay tactic against
workers and consumers.”  (Assem. Com. on
Appr., Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 365 (2023-2024 Reg. Sess.) July 12, 2023, p. 1.)  The court denied defendant’s motion to compel
arbitration because defendant delayed paying arbitration fees under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1281.98.  Issuing
a discretionary stay to further delay this proceeding would undermine the
purpose of both section 1281.98 and Senate Bill 365.
Plaintiff Aaron Friedman’s motion to lift stay
pending appeal is granted.  The court
hereby lifts the stay of this action.
