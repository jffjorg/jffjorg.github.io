And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant LAD-N, LLC dba Nissan of Downtown LA's motion to dismiss Plaintiff Ana Quintana's complaint. This decision is based on the fact that the plaintiff failed to amend their complaint within the 30 days allowed after the court sustained the defendant's demurrer. Although the plaintiff filed an "amendment to complaint" on February 1, 2024, it was not served on the defendant and was filed outside the permitted time frame. As a result, the court will dismiss the complaint under Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision (f)(2). The dismissal is without prejudice, meaning the plaintiff can re-file the complaint if they choose to do so.
