 Case Number:  22STCV01510    Hearing Date:   April 5, 2024    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Robert La Masney’s Motion
for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint
            Plaintiff
Robert La Masney moves for leave to file a second amended complaint.  Courts have discretion to permit an amendment
to any pleading “in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1).) 
“This discretion should be exercised liberally in favor of amendments,
for judicial policy favors resolution of all disputed matters in the same
lawsuit.”  (Kittredge Sports Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1047.)  
Defendants Paul Sandweiss and
Christian Schrader do not oppose this motion. 
They request that the court continue the trial from July 10 to September
23.  They show good cause to do so.  
Plaintiff Robert La Masney’s motion
for leave to file a second amended complaint is granted.  Plaintiff is ordered to file the second
amended complaint forthwith. 
On its own motion, the court hereby continues
the final status conference from June 24, 2024, to September 9, 2024, at
9:00 a.m.  The court hereby continues the jury trial from July 10, 2024,
to September 25, 2024, at 10:00 a.m.  The court hereby continues all
pre-trial deadlines to follow the new trial date.
