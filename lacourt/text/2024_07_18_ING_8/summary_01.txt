Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving David Zeil, the plaintiff, and Southwest Airlines Co., the defendant. The plaintiff has filed motions to compel the defendant to answer Form Interrogatories, Set Two, without objection, to answer Inspection Demands without objection, and to deem Requests for Admission, Set Two, as admitted. The judge finds that the motions to compel responses to Form Interrogatories and Inspection Demands are moot because the defendant has already responded to the discovery requests without objections. However, the judge grants the motion for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,000 per motion, payable by defense counsel to plaintiff's counsel within 30 days. The judge also denies the request to continue the motion for summary judgment, but will inquire with defense counsel if the parties can agree to a continuance before a new motion, opposition, and reply are filed.
