And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to set aside a default entered against Hamzathul Roshana Rashad on March 22, 2022. Defendant Rashad's counsel claims that they agreed to accept service as long as opposing counsel, Cassandra, did not file a Request for Entry of Default without notice. However, Cassandra filed the default without notice, causing Defendant Rashad to mistakenly believe that no default had been entered for over a year. The Judge finds that the default was improperly entered and grants the motion to set aside the default under Code Civ. Proc. ยง 473(b). The Judge also orders counsel for Rashad to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to opposing counsel. The Judge encourages counsel to submit on the tentative ruling and to appear remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
