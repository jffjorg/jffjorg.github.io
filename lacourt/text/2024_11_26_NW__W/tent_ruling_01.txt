This is a premises liability action. On

(erroneously sued as Nordstrom Rack) for premises liability, negligence,
intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of

negligently placed a sharp and dangerous object in an area wherein Plaintiff, a
minor, was struck and injured by said object.

Documents in Response to Request for Production of Documents (Set No. One) is
GRANTED. 
II.

III.

DISCUSSION
 
Defendant Nordstrom, Inc. moves for an
order compelling Plaintiff to provide verified responses, without objections,
to Defendant’s Request for the Production of Documents (Set One), Special
Interrogatories (Set One), and Form Interrogatories (Set One). Defendant also
seeks the imposition of monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s
counsel, in the amount of $1,687.50 per motion. 
 
Where a party fails to serve timely responses to discovery requests,
the court may make an order compelling responses. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300,
2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) A party that fails to serve a timely response to the
discovery request waives any objection to the request, including one based on
privilege or the protection of attorney work product. (CCP §§2030.290(a),
2031.300(a), 2033.280(a); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra,
148 Cal.App.4th at 404.) Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.010,
the propounding party may also move for an order that the genuineness of any
documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. (CCP § 2033.280(b).)
 
On May 17, 2024, Defendant propounded discovery requests onto Plaintiff
including Defendant’s Requests for Production of Documents (Set One), Special
Interrogatories (Set One), and Form Interrogatories (Set One). (Wagener Decl.
¶1, Exh. A.) Plaintiff’s deadline to respond was June 18, 2024. (Wagener Decl.
¶2.) Plaintiff did not request an extension of time to respond. (Wagener Decl.
¶3.) On June 26, 2024, Defendant attempted to meet and confer regarding the
lack of discovery responses and offered a 3 week extension such that the
responses would be due by July 10, 2024. (Wagener Decl. ¶4, Exh. B.) Defendant
did not receive any response. (Wagener Decl. ¶4.) Defendant attempted a few
more times to meet and confer regarding the missing discovery. (Wagener Decl.
¶¶5-6, Exh. B.) As of the date of the motion, Plaintiff has not served any
responses to Defendant’s discovery requests. (Wagener Decl. ¶8.) 
 
No opposition has been filed. Accordingly, Defendant Nordstrom, Inc.’s
Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Responses and Production of Documents in Response
to Request for Production of Documents (Set No. One) is GRANTED; Defendant
Nordstrom, Inc.’s Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set
One) is GRANTED; Defendant Nordstrom, Inc.’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form
Interrogatories (Set One) is GRANTED.
 
Plaintiff to produce discovery responses, without objection, within 15
days. 
 
Sanctions
 
Defendant seeks $1,687.50 in attorney fees per motion, or $5,062.50. If
a propounding party moves for and obtains a court order compelling a response,
the court shall impose monetary sanctions against the party failing to timely
respond to interrogatories and demands for inspection unless that party acted
with substantial justification or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (CCP
§§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300(c), 2033.280(c); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 404.) 
 
 
The court GRANTS the request for attorney fees in the reduced amount of
$1,800.00, total, as reasonable fees for these simple unopposed motions. 
 
Plaintiff ordered to pay sanctions to Defendant and/or Defense counsel
within 30 days of this order.
