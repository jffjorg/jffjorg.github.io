And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion filed by the defendants, David S. Sibelman, Shahnaz Levyim, and Desiree Levyim, to enforce compliance with their request for production of documents. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs, Cornell Gillenwater and Bret Kadel, had not produced all the requested documents, but the plaintiffs claimed that they had produced all the responsive documents. The Judge finds that the motion is moot because the plaintiffs have already produced all the documents, and the defendants' claim that the production is incomplete is not supported by evidence. The Judge also denies the defendants' request for monetary sanctions because the motion was filed without substantial justification, as the defendants could have communicated with the plaintiffs to resolve the issue informally before filing the motion.
