[TENTATIVE] ORDER
  RE:  
 
PLAINTIFF WAVE
  INVESTMENT, LLC’S MOTION TO COMPEL DEFENDANT SECURCAPITAL CORP. TO ANSWER
  DEPOSITION QUESTIONS




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



 
Background 
Plaintiff Wave Investment, LLC (“Wave”) filed this action
on December 30, 2021 against Defendants SecurCapital Corp. (“SecurCapital”) and
Stephen J. Russell (“Russell”) (jointly, “Defendants”) 
Wave filed the operative Third Amended Complaint on
November 15, 2023 alleging causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2)
declaratory relief, (3) breach of partnership or joint venture agreement, (4)
breach of fiduciary duty, (5) conversion, (6) fraudulent concealment, (7)
fraudulent misrepresentation, (8) negligent misrepresentation, (9) unjust
enrichment, 
(10) accounting, and
(11) constructive trust. 
            On February 20, 2024, SecurCapital
filed a Cross-Complaint against Wave and Mark Boyce, alleging causes of action
for (1) fraudulent concealment, (2) fraudulent misrepresentation, (3)
fraudulent inducement, (4) breach of the covenant of good faith and fair
dealing, and (5) declaratory relief. 
            On August 8, 2023, Wave
served a Notice of Deposition of SecurCapital’s Person Most Knowledgeable
(“PMK”). (Salim Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. 2.) On August 24, 2023, Defendants served 
objections to the August 8, 2023 Notice of
Deposition of SecurCapital’s PMK. (Salim Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. 3.) Wave’s counsel
states that “[a]fter meeting and conferring, Defendants agreed to produce
Defendant Stephen J. Russell as SecurCapital’s PMK for a limited-in-time
deposition.” (Salim Decl., ¶ 5.)
            On
October 2, 2023, Wave served a Second Amended Notice of Deposition of
SecurCapital’s PMK. (Salim Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. 4.) Wave’s counsel states that “Russell
was deposed, in his capacity as SecurCapital’s PMK on October 9, 2023.” (Salim
Decl., ¶ 7.)
            On
November 9, 2023, Defendants served a document captioned “Errata Sheet –
Stephen Russel, Vol. II…” (Salim Decl., ¶ 9, Ex. 6.) Wave’s counsel states that
he sent a meet and confer letter to Defendants’ counsel on November 10, 2023,
“seeking to meet and confer regarding the need for additional PMK testimony
from SecurCapital, in light of Russell’s admitted lack of knowledge on certain topics
and the Notice of Errata.” (Salim Decl., ¶ 10.) Wave’s counsel states that
“Defendants’ counsel stated that they would consider a continued deposition if
it was tied to a broader re-opening of fact discovery and third deposition of
Wave’s principal, Mark Boyce.” (Salim Decl., ¶ 12.) 
Wave’s counsel further
states that “[o]n December 1, 2023, I sent Defendants’ counsel a response,
stating that they had not responded to three requests for their availability
for an IDC or to multiple request [sic] for an extension of our deadline to
move to compel, thus Wave had reserved an IDC on December 29, 2023, at 11:30
a.m., and would proceed to brief its motion.” (Salim Decl., ¶ 21.) On December
29, 2023, an Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”) was held. The Court’s
December 29, 2023 minute order provides, inter alia, that “[t]he Court
has reviewed the parties’ Informal Discovery Conference (‘IDC’) statements and
Joint Stipulation Extending Plaintiff’s Deadline to Respond to Defendant
SecurCapital Corp.’s Answer submitted on 12/20/2023. The Informal Discovery is
taken off-calendar.” 
Wave now moves to compel SecurCapital to answer deposition
questions. SecurCapital opposes. 
Discussion 
Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.480, subdivision (a), “[i]f a deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing under the
deponent’s control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition
subpoena, the party seeking discovery may move the court for an order
compelling that answer or production.” Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480, subdivision
(b), “[t]his motion shall be made no later than 60
days after the completion of the record of the deposition, and shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.”
            In the
notice of motion, Wave asserts that “Russell’s admitted lack of
knowledge and preparation, combined with the Notice of Errata, which confirms
his testimony was unreliable on the noticed topics, confirm that he was not a
proper PMK witness; and SecurCapital should be compelled to either produce a
proper PMK or produce Russell again, with evidence that he took efforts to
properly prepare himself.” (Notice of Mot. at pp. 2:26-3:1.) In addition, in
the Conclusion section of the motion, Wave states that it “requests that
SecurCapital be compelled to produce PMK deponent(s) regarding Topics # 25-28
in the PMK Notice.” (Mot. at p. 16:24-25.) 
            As an initial matter, in the
opposition, SecurCapital asserts that “Wave filed the
motion past the cutoff and failed to move to reopen discovery.” (Opp’n at p.
5:25.) SecurCapital states that trial in this matter was initially set
for November 1, 2023. (Lode Decl., ¶ 6.) On November
4, 2022, the Court issued a Case Management Conference Order in this action
providing, inter alia, that the case is set for trial on November 1,
2023.  
SecurCapital asserts that “pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.020(a), the
discovery motion cutoff date was October 17, 2023.” (Opp’n at p. 4:9-11.) Code of Civil Procedure section
2024.020, subdivision (a) provides that “[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this chapter, any party
shall be entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings on or
before the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery heard on or
before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the action.”
Fifteen days before November 1, 2023 is October 17, 2023. However, the instant
motion was filed on December 8, 2023 and set for hearing on August 9, 2024. 
SecurCapital asserts that Wave’s
counsel acknowledged the discovery cutoff. SecurCapital
points to a November 30, 2023 email from Wave’s counsel providing, inter
alia, that “[g]iven that we did not receive the Notice of Errata until
November 9, 2023, we will seek leave to have the motion heard, notwithstanding
the discovery motion cut-off based on the initial trial date.” (Salim Decl., ¶
13, Ex. 9, p. 130.) 
In addition, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.020, subdivision (b), “[e]xcept
as provided in Section 2024.050, a continuance or
postponement of the trial date does not operate to reopen discovery proceedings.”
On October 9, 2023, the Court issued a minute order in
this action providing, inter alia, that “[p]ursuant to the
request of moving party, the Jury Trial scheduled for 11/01/2023 is continued
to 12/06/23...” The Court’s October 9, 2023 minute
order further provides that “[p]ursuant to the request of moving party,
the Final Status Conference scheduled for 10/20/2023 is continued to 11/17/23...”
SecurCapital notes that the October 9, 2023 minute
order did not order discovery to remain open or extend the discovery or
discovery motion cutoff dates. (Lode Decl., ¶ 6.) 
            In addition, the Court’s November
17, 2023 minute order in this matter provides, inter alia, that “Defendant
makes an oral motion to continue trial. All Parties stipulate to the trial
continuance. The Court grants the oral motion to continue trial, however due to
the Court not being able to accommodate [sic] an earlier trial date the trial
is continued to December 11, 2024.” SecurCapital
notes that the November 17, 2023 minute order did not extend the
discovery or discovery motion cutoff dates. (Lode Decl., ¶ 7.) 
            SecurCapital
asserts that “Wave was required to file a motion for leave to have its Motion
heard after the discovery motion cutoff date…Wave failed to do so.” (Opp’n at
p. 6:1-3, emphasis omitted.) SecurCapital asserts
that “[a]s Wave has not moved to reopen discovery, the Court should deny
the Motion on this basis alone.” (Opp’n at p. 5:27-28.) SecurCapital cites to Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products,
Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1586-1587, where the Court of Appeal
noted as follows: 
 
“Subdivision
(a) of section 2024.020 specifies that “[e]xcept as
provided in this chapter, any party shall be entitled as a matter of right … to have motions
concerning discovery heard on or before the 15th day, before the date initially
set for the trial of the action.” (Italics added.) Thus, if a party
properly notices a discovery motion to be heard on or before the discovery motion
cutoff date, that party has a right to
have the motion heard. By negative implication, a party who notices a discovery
motion to be heard after the
discovery motion cutoff date does not have a right to have the motion heard.
But the fact that a party does not have a right to have a discovery motion heard
after the discovery motion cutoff date does not mean the court has no power to hear it, or that the court errs in
hearing it. Indeed, subdivision (a) of section 2024.050
specifically allows a discovery motion to be heard after the discovery motion
cutoff date by providing that “the court may grant leave … to have a motion
concerning discovery heard, closer to the initial trial date, or to reopen
discovery after a new trial date has been set.”…But that
statute also specifies that such leave may be granted “[o]n motion of any
party.” (§
2024.050, subd. (a).) Moreover, such
a motion must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration…and in
exercising its discretion to grant or deny the motion the court must consider
various factors, including (but not limited to) “[t]he necessity and the
reasons for the discovery” and “[t]he diligence or lack of diligence of the
party seeking … the hearing of a discovery motion, and the reasons that … the
discovery motion was not heard earlier.” (§ 2024.050,
subds. (a), (b)(1), (2).).” (Emphasis in original.) 
Here, it does not appear that Wave filed any motion for leave to
reopen discovery pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2024.050. 
In its reply, Wave asserts that “SecurCapital has already agreed to
permit the relief sought in the Motion. This highlights the frivolousness of
its arguments based on a discovery cut-off that does not apply to their
Cross-Complaint and a PMK notice that has been superseded.” (Reply at p.
3:23-25, emphasis omitted.) As an initial matter, in support of its assertion
that “SecurCapital has already agreed to permit the relief sought in the
Motion,” Wave appears to rely on the Declaration of Daniel S. Miller filed with
the reply. The
Court notes that “[t]he general rule of motion practice…is that new evidence is
not permitted with reply papers.” (Jay v. Mahaffey¿(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537¿.)¿SecurCapital
has not had the opportunity to address the evidence filed with Wave’s reply. 
Moreover, Wave does not appear to dispute that “the discovery motion
cutoff date was October 17, 2023.” (Opp’n at p. 4:10-11.) Wave does not appear
to cite any legal authority in support its assertion that this cut-off date
does not apply because SecurCapital filed a Cross-Complaint.
In addition, as noted by SecurCapital in the opposition, SecurCapital
did not move for leave to file a Cross-Complaint until December 19, 2023, after
Wave filed the instant motion on December 8, 2023. (Lode Decl., ¶ 8.) Thus, the
Court does not see how SecurCapital’s
subsequent filing of the Cross-Complaint is relevant to Wave’s instant motion. 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Wave’s motion is denied.  
SecurCapital is ordered to provide notice of
this Order.
