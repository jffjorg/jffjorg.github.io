And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the parties' statements and joint stipulations regarding the motion to compel SecurCapital to answer deposition questions. The court finds that the discovery motion cutoff date was October 17, 2023, and that Wave failed to file a motion for leave to reopen discovery. The court also notes that SecurCapital has already agreed to permit the relief sought in the motion.

Based on the foregoing, the court denies Wave's motion. SecurCapital is ordered to provide notice of this order.
