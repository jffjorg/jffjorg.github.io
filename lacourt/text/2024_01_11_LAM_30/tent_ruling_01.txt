Hernandez vs. Legacy
Management Services, Inc., et. al., Case No. 23STCV08155
 
Tentative Ruling
re:  Defendants’ Demurrer to Complaint;
Motion to Strike
 
Defendants Legacy Management
Services, Inc., PAMA Management, Inc., and Group VII Covina Properties, LP
(collectively, Defendants) demur to and move to strike the Complaint of  Plaintiff Oscar Hernandez (Plaintiff). The
demurrer is sustained with ten (10) days leave to amend. The motion to strike
is denied as moot.
 
In reviewing the legal sufficiency of a complaint against a demurrer, a
court will treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,
but not contentions, deductions, or conclusions of law. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 (Blank); C & H Foods Co.
v. Hartford Ins. Co. (1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 1055, 1062.) It is well settled
that a “demurrer lies only for defects appearing on the face of the
complaint[.]” (Stevens v. Superior Court
(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 594, 601.) “The rules by which the sufficiency of a
complaint is tested against a general demurrer are well settled. We not only
treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but also
give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its
parts in their context.” (Guclimane Co.
v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38 (internal quotes
omitted).) For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, the complaint must be
construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the facts pleaded. (Wilner v. Sunset Life Ins. Co. (2000) 78
Cal.App.4th 952, 958.)
When ruling on a demurrer, the Court may only consider the complaint’s
allegations or matters which may be judicially noticed. (Blank, supra, 39 Cal.3d at 318.) The Court may not consider any other
extrinsic evidence or judge the credibility of the allegations plead or the
difficulty a plaintiff may have in proving his allegations. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110
Cal.App.3d 868, 881.) A demurrer is properly sustained only when the complaint,
liberally construed, fails to state facts sufficient to constitute any cause of
action. (Kramer v. Intuit Inc. (2004)
121 Cal.App.4th 574, 578.)
 
Plaintiff alleges that demurring
Defendants and two other individual defendants, Daniel Gonzalez, and Daniel
Cervantez, leased to Plaintiff the residential property at 2456 North Magnolia
Ave., Rialto, CA (the Property). (Comp. ¶ 18.) Because the Property “had faulty
electricity and no air conditioning” and was hot during the summer, Plaintiff
purchased an outdoor cooker to cook outside. (Comp. ¶ 19.) Plaintiff placed the
outdoor cooker in the back side yard of the Property, next to the garage.
(Comp. ¶ 20.) Nearby, there was “a hole in the wall of the garage that appeared
to be meant for a dryer hose.” (Comp. ¶ 27.) This hole allegedly allowed gas
from a leaking gas tank used with the cooker to enter the garage. (Comp. ¶ 27.)
On August 18, 2021, Plaintiff was
using the outdoor cooker in the side yard. (Comp. ¶ 28.) Plaintiff entered the
garage to reach the house. As Plaintiff walked through the garage, the pilot
light on his water heater turned on and ignited the gas from the leaking tank
in the cooker. (Comp. ¶ 30.) This resulted in an explosion which caused extreme
physical injury to Plaintiff and property damage. (Comp. ¶ 31.)
 
Plaintiff has asserted two causes
of action against Defendants, for Negligence (Premises Liability) and Breach of
Implied Warranty of Habitability. Plaintiff’s negligence claim alleges,
“Plaintiff and Defendants were in privity of contract at the time of the
incident. Defendants were Plaintiff’s landlord, and Plaintiff was Defendants’
tenant,” and that Defendants breached their duty of care owed to Plaintiff as
landlords. (Comp. ¶¶ 39-43.) The claim for breach of implied warranty of
habitability likewise alleges that “Plaintiff and Defendants had a contract for
a lease agreement, where Plaintiff had the right to occupy the Premises.”
(Comp. ¶ 61.)
 
Defendants demur on the basis that
Plaintiff has not properly pled the agreement establishing the parties’ alleged
landlord-tenant relationship. The Court agrees. 
 
“An action
by a tenant alleging a breach of the warranty of habitability
is an action on the contract…”
(Fairchild v. Park (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 919, 924–25.) “A written
contract may be pleaded either by its terms—set out verbatim in the complaint
or a copy of the contract attached to the complaint and incorporated therein by
reference—or by its legal effect. In order to plead a contract by its legal
effect, plaintiff must ‘allege the substance of its relevant terms. This is
more difficult, for it requires a careful analysis of the instrument,
comprehensiveness in statement, and avoidance of legal conclusions.’” (McKell
v. Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1489.) In
determining whether a landlord-tenant relationship exists from the facts
alleged, “[t]he relationship created by the agreement
must be characterized by reference to the rights and obligations of the parties
and not by labels. (Greene v. Municipal Court (1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 446,
450.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff has failed to
sufficiently plead the lease agreement underlying his claims against
Defendants. Plaintiff has neither attached a copy of the contract to the
Complaint nor pled the contract by its legal effect. Given this, Plaintiff has
not pled the existence of a landlord-tenant relationship between him and
Defendants, and so both claims against Defendants fail.
 
            Defendants
also move to strike Plaintiff’s prayers for attorney’s fees and punitive
damages and related allegations. (Comp. ¶ 52; Prayer (1st) 5-6, (3rd) 5.)
Because the demurrer is sustained, the motion to strike is denied as moot.
