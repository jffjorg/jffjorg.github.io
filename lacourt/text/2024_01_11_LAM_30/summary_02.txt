And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Amber Castro's motion to tax costs claimed by Defendants Room Forty, Inc. and Hospitality Collaborative, LLC. The motion is granted in part. The Judge finds that the Memorandum of Costs was timely filed and that the costs claimed were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, except for courier or messenger fees, which are not specifically enumerated as allowable costs and were not reasonably necessary. The Judge taxes the costs in the amount of $267.69 and denies the motion otherwise.
