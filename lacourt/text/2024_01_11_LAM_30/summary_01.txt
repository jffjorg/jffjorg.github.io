Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has sustained the demurrer filed by the defendants, Legacy Management Services, Inc., et. al., and denied the motion to strike the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Oscar Hernandez. The plaintiff's complaint alleges that the defendants breached their duty of care and warranty of habitability by failing to ensure that the residential property at 2456 North Magnolia Ave., Rialto, CA, was safe and habitable. The plaintiff claims that the property had faulty electricity and no air conditioning, and that an explosion caused by a leaking gas tank used with an outdoor cooker resulted in physical injury and property damage.

The judge has determined that the plaintiff has failed to sufficiently plead the lease agreement underlying his claims against the defendants. The plaintiff has neither attached a copy of the contract to the complaint nor pled the contract by its legal effect. As a result, the plaintiff has not established a landlord-tenant relationship between him and the defendants, and both claims against the defendants fail.

The defendants also moved to strike the plaintiff's prayers for attorney's fees and punitive damages, but the motion is denied as moot since the demurrer is sustained.
