And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Plaintiff Timothy Watts to amend the complaint to include American Express Corporation as a defendant. The motion was filed because American Express Corporation directly contacted Plaintiff despite his revocation of consent for direct contact and provision of attorney contact information. The judge finds that Plaintiff has not sufficiently satisfied the requirements under California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, and therefore CONTINUES the hearing on the motion. The judge orders Plaintiff to file and serve supplemental papers providing specifications, by reference to pages and lines, of the allegations that would be deleted and added to the proposed First Amended Complaint at least 16 court days before the next scheduled hearing.
