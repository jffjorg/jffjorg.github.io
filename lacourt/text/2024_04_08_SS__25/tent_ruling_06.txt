BACKGROUND
On February
21, 2023, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company
(“Plaintiff”) filed a subrogation action against Defendants Maria Estela
Gonzalez aka Maria Robles (“Gonzalez”), and P.V. Holding Corp. (“P.V. Holding
Corp.”) (collectively “Defendants”).
On April 6,
2023, Defendant P.V. Holding Corp filed its answer to the complaint. 
On October
27, 2023, Defendant P.V. Holding Corp. filed a motion for the Court to deem its
Request for Admissions, Set One, as admitted as well as other discovery motions
to compel responses to its Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and
Request for Production. The Court granted P.V. Holding Corp.’s discovery
motions and issued sanctions in the amount of $1,080.00 against the Plaintiff.
On February
01, 2024, Defendant P.V. Holding Corp filed the instant Motion for Order for
Terminating Sanctions and Request for and Monetary Sanctions in the Total
Amount of $2,220.00. 
No
opposition has been filed.
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
Defendant P.V. Holding Corp. prays for the Court to issue
an order for monetary, terminating, and contempt sanctions against Plaintiff
under C.C.P. § 2023.030 (a), (d) (1), (3) & (4), and (e). P.V. Holding Corp. argues that the
motion is proper as Plaintiff violated the Court’s December 7, 2023, Order, by
not serving verified, objection free, responses to P.V. Holding Corp.’s Form
Interrogatories, Set One and Special Interrogatories, Set One as well as not complying
with the Court’s order to pay $1,080.00 in monetary sanctions. P.V. Holding
Corp. requests that monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,220.00 be entered
against Plaintiff and its counsel jointly and separately.

ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal Standard
Where a party willfully disobeys a discovery order, courts
have discretion to impose terminating, issue, evidence, or monetary
sanctions.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010(d), (g), 2023.030; R.S.
Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure § 2030.040 requires that “[a]
request for a sanction shall, in the notice of motion, identify every person,
party, and attorney against whom the sanction is sought, and specify the type
of sanction sought.”  Furthermore, the notice of motion shall be supported
by a memorandum of points and authorities and accompanied by a declaration
setting forth facts supporting the amount of any monetary sanction
sought.  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.040.) 
 
Monetary sanctions may be imposed “ordering that one engaging in the
misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both
pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct…unless [the Court] finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. §
2030.030(a).) 
 
Issue sanctions may be imposed “ordering that designated
facts shall be taken as established in the action in accordance with the claim
of the party adversely affected by the misuse of the discovery process. The
court may also impose an issue sanction by an order prohibiting any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from supporting or opposing
designated claims or defenses.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.030(b).) 
 
Evidence sanctions may be imposed “by an order prohibiting any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from introducing designated
matters in evidence.”  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.030(c).) 
 
In more extreme cases, the Court may also impose
terminating sanctions by “striking out the pleadings or parts of the
pleadings,” “staying further proceedings,” “dismissing the action, or any part
of the action,” or “rending a judgment by default” against the party misusing
the discovery process.  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.030(d).)  The
court should look to the totality of the circumstances in determining whether
terminating sanctions are appropriate.  (Lang v. Hochman (2000)
77¿Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)  Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified
where there is a willful discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and
evidence showing that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with
discovery rules.  (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196¿Cal.App.4th 1495,
1516.)  “[A] penalty as severe as dismissal or default is not authorized
where noncompliance with discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather
than willfulness or bad faith.”  (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d
701, 707.)  “Although in extreme cases a court has the authority to order
a terminating sanction as a first measure [citations], a terminating sanction
should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less severe
alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly shows
lesser sanctions would be ineffective.”  (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible and
Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604-605.) 
 
II.        Discussion 
 
Defendant P.V. Holding Corp. moves for terminating
sanctions, dismissing the action with prejudice or in the alternative for the
Court to enter judgment by default against Plaintiff and for monetary sanctions
in the amount of $2,220.00 for expenses incurred in bringing the instant
Motion. (Mot. p. 9.) P.V. Holding Corp. argues that sanctions are appropriate
because Plaintiff has failed to respond to serve verified, objection free,
responses to P.V.
Holding Corp.’s Form Interrogatories, Set One and Special Interrogatories, Set
One, even after the Court ordered Plaintiff to do so on December 7, 2023. (Id. p.
8.) Additionally, P.V.
Holding Corp asserts that Plaintiff has failed to pay $1,080.00 as ordered by
the Court. 
 
P.V. Holding Corp provides the Court with the declaration
of its Counsel who states that on December 7, 2023, the Court ordered Defendant
to provide Plaintiff with full, complete, and objection free
responses.
(Gene S. Stone Decl. ¶ 9.) Counsel avers that to date Plaintiff has not complied
with any aspect of the Court’s order and that there is no evidence to suggest
that Plaintiff will change its position. (Id. ¶ 10.) P.V. Holding Corp argues that Plaintiff’s
disobedience and disregard for the Court and the rules of civil procedure are
intentional and willful. (Id.) 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has not
complied with the Court’s order. In failing to provide responses to P.V. Holding Corp’s discovery request, Plaintiff has obstructed P.V.
Holding Corp.’s efforts to defend this
action resulting in a misuse of the discovery process.
 
P.V. Holding Corp seeks $2,220.00 in monetary sanctions for five (5) hours of
attorney time working on the motion, plus an anticipated one hour attending the
hearing, at a rate of $180.00 per hour, in addition to $60.00 in costs. (Stone Decl.
¶ 12.)  
 
The Court notes that since filing its
Complaint on February 21, 2023, Plaintiff has not responded to P.V. Holding Corp’s discovery
requests, motions to compel discovery, or the instant motion for terminating sanctions.
The Court further notes that default was entered against Defendant Gonzalez on
March 04, 2023. (See. 03/04/24 Request for Entry of Default.)  Plaintiff has not provided the Court with any
response showing that its actions were caused by inability to comply
rather than willfulness or bad faith.
Moreover, while terminating sanctions are a harsh penalty, the history of the
instant case demonstrates that Plaintiff is unwilling to comply with P.V. Holding Corp’s requests or
the Court’s orders and thus, lesser sanctions have not been effective in
producing compliance. However, the Court fails to see a valid justification to
dismiss the matter with prejudice as requested by P.V. Holding Corp. 
 
For these reasons, the Court finds an
order dismissing the action without prejudice to be appropriate. Plaintiff’s
Complaint filed on February 21, 2023, is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

 
However, the Court declines to award
further monetary sanctions as doing so would be futile in producing compliance. 
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
Defendant P.V. Holding Corp’s Motion for
Order for Terminating Sanctions is GRANTED. 
 
Plaintiff’s Complaint, filed on February 21,
2023, is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE as to Defendant P.V. Holding Corp.           
 
Defendant P.V. Holding Corp’s request for further
monetary sanctions is DENIED.  
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
