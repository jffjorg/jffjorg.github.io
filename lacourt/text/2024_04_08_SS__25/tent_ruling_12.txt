Chung (“Chung”) and RAR2-Villa Marina Center aka RAR2-Villa Marina  Center CA, LLC (“RAR2-Villa Marina Center”) (collectively “Defendants”).   Defendants  filed their Answer to Plaintiff’s Complaint on November 30, 2023.    On  February 27, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion to Compel RAR2 -Villa  Marina Center’s Answers to Interrogatories; Motion to Compel Bageldelicious LLC  Answers to Interrogatories and request for monetary sanctions.    No  opposition has been filed.     MOVING PARTY  POSITION               Plaintiff prays  for the Court to issue an order compelling Defendants Bageldelicious and RAR2-Villa  Marina Center to serve verified responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories  served on Defendants on December 12, 2023. Plaintiff makes this motion on the  grounds that Bageldelicious and RAR2-Villa Marina Center failed to serve timely  responses to Plaintiff’s Special interrogatories after Plaintiff propounded  them on the Defendants. Plaintiff additionally requests that the Court issue  sanctions in the amount of $500.00 against Defendants Bageldelicious,  RAR2-Villa Marina Center, and their attorney.    OPPOSITION                No opposition has been filed.    REPLY                No reply has been filed.   ANALYSIS   I.          Legal Standard   A party must  respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service.  (Code Civ.  Proc., §¿2030.260(a).)  If a party to whom interrogatories are directed  does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order  compelling response to the discovery.  (Code Civ. Proc.  §¿2030.290(b).)  Once compelled to respond, the party waives the right to  make any objections, including ones based on privilege or work-product  protection.  (Code Civ. Proc. §¿2030.290(a).)  There is no time limit  for a motion to compel responses to interrogatories other than the cut-off on  hearing discovery motions 15 days before trial.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§  2024.020(a), 2030.290.)  No “meet and confer”: efforts are required before  filing a motion to compel responses to the discovery.  (See Code  Civ. Proc. §¿2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific  Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)       II.        Discussion As  a preliminary matter the Court notes that Plaintiff provides the same  underlying facts for both motions. Thus, for the purposes of this order the  Court will address both motions together below.    Here,  Plaintiff provides the declaration of its counsel who states that on December  01, 2023, his office served Defendants Bageldelicious and RAR2-Villa Marina  Center with Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories, Set One. (Morse Mehrban Decl. ¶  3; Exh. A.) Counsel avers that no responses to the interrogatories have been  received. (Id.¶ 4.) Counsel additionally provides his correspondence sent  to Bageldelicious and RAR2-Villa Marina Center’s counsel requesting their respective  responses to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories. (Id. ¶ 5; Exh. B.)   Here,  the Court finds that more than 30 days have lapsed since Plaintiff served its  Special Interrogatories on Defendants on December 01, 2023.  Defendants’ timely responses were due by or  before January 02, 2024. Here, Plaintiff  provides evidence showing that Defendants have not provided any responses to Plaintiff’s  discovery requests. Since more than thirty (30) days has lapsed since  Plaintiff served its Special Interrogatories, Plaintiff is entitled to pursue  the instant motion.     Thus, the Court GRANTS  Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Answers to Interrogatories (Set One)  as to both Defendants.   D.  Sanctions   The Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290(c) provides  in relevant part that,     “The court shall impose a monetary sanction under [Section  2023.010] against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or  opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it finds that  the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that  other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”   (Code Civ.  Proc., § 2030.290(c).)                Moreover, Code of Civil  Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that  the court may impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of  the discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s  fees, incurred by anyone because of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery  process includes failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of  discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Furthermore, it is  “mandatory that the Court impose a monetary sanction…on the party or attorney,  or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission  necessitated this motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)    The Court finds Defendants’ failure  to respond to Plaintiff’s discovery request to be a misuse of the discovery  process. Plaintiff has successfully argued the motion and without evidence to  the contrary, the Court cannot find that either Bageldelicious or  RAR2-Villa Marina Center acted  with substantial justification in failing to respond to Plaintiff’s discovery  request. Thus, the Court must impose monetary sanctions on both Bageldelicious  and RAR2-Villa Marina Center  for their failure to respond to the discovery request that necessitated the  instant motion.    Plaintiff seeks $500.00 in attorney’s fees for  each motion to be issued as sanctions against Bageldelicious and  RAR2-Villa Marina Center and their counsel for one hour spent working on the  instant motion. The Court finds the request to be reasonable considering the  simplicity of the Motion and the lack of opposition and replies. Accordingly,  the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for sanctions in the amount of $500 each  against Defendants Bageldelicious and RAR2-Villa Marina Center.   III.       Conclusion                           Plaintiff Clifford  Johnson’s Motion to Compel RAR2 -Villa Marina Center’s Answers to  Interrogatories is GRANTED. Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Bageldelicious LLC’s  Answers to Interrogatories is also GRANTED.    Plaintiff’s  Request for Monetary Sanctions against Defendants Bageldelicious and  RAR2-Villa Marina Center is GRANTED in the amount of $500.00 each against  Defendants’ counsel ONLY.    DEFENDANT BAGELDELICIOUS LLC IS ORDERED TO RESPOND TO PLAINTIFF’S SPECIAL  INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE WITH  CODE COMPLIANT, OBJECTION-FREE VERIFIED RESPONSES WITHIN TWENTY (20) DAYS OF NOTICE  OF THIS COURT'S ORDER.    DEFENDANT RAR2 -VILLA MARINA CENTER CA SPE, INC.
