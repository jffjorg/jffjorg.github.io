And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel answers to interrogatories from defendants Bageldelicious, LLC, Stephanie N. Chung, and RAR2-Villa Marina Center CA, LLC. The plaintiff had served the interrogatories on December 01, 2023, and the defendants failed to respond. The judge finds that more than 30 days have lapsed since the interrogatories were served, and the defendants' failure to respond constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. The judge orders the defendants to respond to the interrogatories within 20 days and imposes monetary sanctions on the defendants and their counsel in the amount of $500.00 each.
