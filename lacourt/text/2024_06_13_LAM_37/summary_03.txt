Reply: 6 June 2024

Background:
On May 17, 2023, Plaintiff Cynthia McKinney filed a Complaint against Dave & Buster's Management Corporation, Inc. ("D&B" or "Defendant") and others.

Facts:
- Plaintiff was employed by D&B as a bartender from July 2021 to December 2022.
- Plaintiff alleged that she experienced sexual harassment by her supervisor/manager Justin Williams.
- Plaintiff complained to the manager above Williams, who told her not to say anything to anyone else.

Legal Standard:
- California law reflects a strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a relatively quick and inexpensive method for resolving disputes.

Discussion:
- The court found that an enforceable arbitration agreement exists between the parties.
- The court found that Plaintiff's claims are within the scope of the arbitration agreement.
- Defendant D&B argued that the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (EFAA) does not apply because Plaintiff's claims accrued before March 3, 2022.
- The court found that Plaintiff's sexual harassment claim did not accrue until after her termination on December 10, 2022.
- The court found that the EFAA applies to Plaintiff's dispute because it arose after March 3, 2022.

Dispute:
- The court found that a dispute arose when Plaintiff suffered an injury, and the Defendant expressed disagreement or took an adversarial posture.
- The court found that the EFAA bars the entire arbitration agreement, not just the claims related to sexual harassment.

Ruling:
- Defendant D&B's Motion to Compel Arbitration is denied.
- The court declines to issue a written statement of decision.
- Defendant to give notice.

The judge's tentative ruling is that the Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration is denied. The court found that the EFAA applies to the dispute because it arose after March 3, 2022. The court also found that the EFAA bars the entire arbitration agreement, not just the claims related to sexual harassment.
