Tompkins, et al.,TENTATIVE RULING:Plaintiffs Rita Cuadros, Nancy Cuadros, and Veronica O’Hacer’s Motion to Reclassify is DENIED.THIS CASE IS RECLASSIFIED AS AN UNLIMITED CIVIL CASE AND TRANSFERRED TO THE RECLASSIFICATION/TRANSFER DESK FOR COLLECTION OF FEES AND REASSIGNMENT TO AN UNLIMITED JURISDICTION COURT. PLAINTIFFS ARE TO PAY THE RECLASSIFICATION FEE WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF THIS ORDER.ANALYSIS:On December 19, 2023, Plaintiffs Rita Cuadros, Nancy Cuadros, and Veronica O’Hacer (“Plaintiffs”) filed the instant action for breach of contract, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief against Defendants Martha Tonkins (erroneously sued as Martha Tompkins), Kimberly Stoll (erroneously sued as Defendant Kimberly Cuadros) (“Defendant Stoll”), Miguel Cuadros (“Defendant Cuadros”), SCI California Funeral Services, Inc. dba Oakdale Memorial Park (erroneously sued as Oakdale Cemetery) (“Defendant SCI”) and Dignity Memorial (“Defendant Dignity”). Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint adding causes of action for fraud and negligent infliction of emotional distresson on April 25, 2024. Defendants Stoll, Cuadros, Tonkins and SCI filed responses to the action in June 2024.Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion to Reclassify this Action on October 3, 2024. The Motion initially came for hearing on December 5, 2024 and was continued to January 15, 2025 to allow Plaintiffs to demonstrate service of the moving papers and notice of the hearing date. (Minute Order, 12/05/24.) The Court also set an order to show cause why the action should not be reclassified for the new hearing date. (Ibid.) One day prior to the hearing, Plaintiffs filed a proof of service showing electronic service of the Motion only to Defendant SCI. No proofs of service of the Motion are in the Court’s record with respect to Defendants Stoll, Cuadros, and Tonkins. On January 8, 2025, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Tentative Ruling and Continuance of Motion to Reclassify, which is not accompanied by a proof of service and erroneously states that the Court’s tentative ruling was to grant the Motion to Reclassify. (Notice of Tentative Ruling, 01/08/25.)DiscussionThe Motion is not accompanied by a proof of service showing service of the moving papers or of the notice of the motion and hearing date on Defendants Stoll, Cuadros, and Tonkins. Failure to give notice of a motion is not only a violation of the statutory requirements but of due process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005; Jones v. Otero (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 754, 757.) Accordingly, the Motion to Reclassify this Action is denied.However, in light of the declaratory and injunctive relief sought in the Complaint and First Amended Complaint with respect to the parties’ rights and the placement of the headstone ordered for Plaintiffs’ mother, the Court finds this action should be reclassified to an unlimited jurisdiction court. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 85, 86.)ConclusionPlaintiffs Rita Cuadros, Nancy Cuadros, and Veronica O’Hacer’s Motion to Reclassify is DENIED.THIS CASE IS RECLASSIFIED AS AN UNLIMITED CIVIL CASE AND TRANSFERRED TO THE RECLASSIFICATION/TRANSFER DESK FOR COLLECTION OF FEES AND REASSIGNMENT TO AN UNLIMITED JURISDICTION COURT. PLAINTIFFS ARE TO PAY THE RECLASSIFICATION FEE WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS OF THIS ORDER.Court clerk to give notice.
