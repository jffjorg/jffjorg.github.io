 Case Number:  24STCP00963    Hearing Date:   January 15, 2025    Dept:  26 Carrillo v. Becerra, et al.,TENTATIVE RULING:Petitioner Fabian Carrillo’s Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award is DISMISSED.ANALYSIS:On March 17, 2024, Petitioner Fabian Carrillo (“Petitioner”) filed the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award (the “Petition”) against Laura Becerra (“Respondent”). The Petition initially came for hearing on July 31, 2024, at which time the Court ruled that it did not meet the necessary procedural or substantive statutory requirements. (Minute Order, 07/31/24.) These requirements were detailed in the Court’s order and the hearing was continued to give Petitioner an opportunity to correct the deficiencies. (Ibid.) On September 26, 2024, Petitioner filed a document entitled “Evidence.”At the second hearing on October 30, 2024, the Court noted that still no proof of service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing has been filed as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4. (Minute Order, 10/30/24, p. 1.) It also pointed out that the arbitration award resolves a dispute between Laura Becerra and “Fabian Carrillo Pools.” (Id. at p. 3) As it is unclear if “Fabian Carrillo Pools” is a dba of Petitioner, and it is unclear whether Petitioner is a named party to the arbitration, the Petition could not be granted solely on behalf of “Fabian Carrillo.” (Ibid.) Following oral argument by Petitioner, the Court continued the hearing again. (Ibid.)To date, no proof of service to the Petition, nor amended Petition, has been filed.Legal Standard“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award. The petition shall name as respondent all parties to the arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.) “If a petition or response under this chapter is duly served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered in this state or another state, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.)A response to a Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award that seeks to vacate or correct the award must be served and filed no later than 100 days after the date of the service of a signed copy of the award on the respondent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.2.)DiscussionCode of Civil Procedure, section 1290.4 requires that the Petition and Notice of Hearing be served on Respondents “in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for the service of such petition and notice” or “[i]f the arbitration agreement does not provide the manner in which such service shall be made . . . [s]ervice within this State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4, subds. (a), (b).)It remains that no proof of service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing has been filed as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4. The arbitration agreement is submitted with the “Evidence,” which demonstrates that it does not provide for the manner of service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing. The Petition must therefore be served in the manner provided for service of a summons. Without a proof of service, the Court cannot find that the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4 are satisfied.Service of the Arbitration Award and Timing of Service of Petition (CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4)Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6 requires that “[t]he neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by registered or certified mail or as provided in the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1283.6.) This requirement may be satisfied by service by the arbitrator, or upon proper service of the Award with the Petition. (See Murry v. Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 796, 799-800.) The arbitration award was served on the parties by certified mail on February 7, 2023, meeting the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6. (Evidence, p. 3.)Also, a party seeking a court judgment confirming an arbitration award must file and serve the petition no more than four years, but not less than 10 days, after the award is served. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.) As there is no proof of service of the Petition, Petitioner also has not demonstrated compliance with Code of Civil Procedure sections 1288 and 1288.4.Confirmation of the Arbitration AwardAn arbitration award is not directly enforceable until it is confirmed by a court and judgment is entered. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1287.6; Jones v. Kvistad (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 836, 840.) The court must confirm the award as made, unless it corrects or vacates the award, or dismisses the proceeding. (CCP § 1286; Valsan Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) Code of Civil Procedure, section 1285.4 states a petition under this chapter shall:a) Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement.b) Set forth the names of the arbitrators.c) Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.(Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.) Also, as previously noted, the Petition demonstrates that the arbitration award resolves a dispute between Laura Becerra and “Fabian Carrillo Pools.” (Id. at p. 3.) The Petition cannot be granted solely on behalf of “Fabian Carrillo.”ConclusionTherefore, Petitioner Fabian Carrillo’s Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award is DISMISSED.Court clerk to give notice.
