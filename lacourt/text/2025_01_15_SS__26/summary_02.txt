And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, USAA Casualty Insurance Company, filed a motion to compel responses to interrogatories and request for production of documents, as well as a request for order awarding monetary sanctions against defendants Woods, et al. and Jesus Mora. The motion is continued to February 4, 2025, at 10:00 am in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse. The plaintiff is required to make an additional motion reservation and pay the required filing fee by January 21, 2025. The judge ruled that the plaintiff's motion combines two separate motions and avoids payment of filing fees, which is unfair and manipulates the court reservation system. The judge also cited a California statute that statutorily required filing fees are jurisdictional and must be paid.
