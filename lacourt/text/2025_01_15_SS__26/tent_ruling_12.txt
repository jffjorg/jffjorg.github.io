Saban Clinic, et al.,TENTATIVE RULING:Defendant The Los Angeles Free Clinic dba Saban Community Clinic’s Demurrer to the Complaint is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.ANALYSIS:On September 18, 2024, Plaintiff Tara Eber (“Plaintiff”), in propria persona, filed the Complaint in this action against Defendant Los Angeles Free Clinic dba Saban Community Clinic (“Defendant”) (erroneously sued as Saban Clinic).On December 11, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Demurrer to the Complaint. No opposition has been filed to date.DiscussionThe Demurrer is accompanied by a meet and confer declaration as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41. (Demurrer, Lowell Decl., ¶2 and Exh. A.) Defendant demurs on the grounds that the Complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action. (Citing Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) The Complaint indicates that it raises a cause of action for premises liability but attaches no facts in support of such a claim, as required. (Compl., ¶10(e).) Some words are handwritten on the second page of the Complaint but none form a coherent sentence. (Id. at p. 2.) Nor has Plaintiff filed any opposition to the instant Demurrer demonstrating that facts can be alleged to articulate a cause of action against Defendant. Therefore, the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.ConclusionDefendant The Los Angeles Free Clinic dba Saban Community Clinic’s Demurrer to the Complaint is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.Moving party to give notice.
