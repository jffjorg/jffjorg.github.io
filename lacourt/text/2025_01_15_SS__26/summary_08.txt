And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling dismissing the Petition to Correct Arbitration Award filed by Westlake Direct, LLC (Petitioner) against Dirahn D. Williams (Respondent). The Petitioner had previously filed a Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award, which was denied without prejudice. The Petitioner then filed the instant Petition to Correct Arbitration Award, but failed to provide proof of service of the petition and notice of hearing as required by law. The judge found that the Petitioner's failure to comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1290.4, which governs service of petitions and notices of hearing, meant that the petition was invalid and must be dismissed. The court clerk is instructed to give notice of the dismissal.
