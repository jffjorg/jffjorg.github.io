And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to vacate the default judgment. The default judgment was entered on October 17, 2024, after the defendant failed to appear for trial. The defendant claims that they did not know the trial date was set for October 17, 2024, and that they did not receive any notice of the upcoming trial date. The judge has accepted the defendant's explanation and has vacated the default judgment. As a result, the trial date has been reset for April 16, 2025, at 8:30 am in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
