Durant (“Plaintiff”) served Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and Requests for Admission, Set One, on Defendant Jack Tatum (“Defendant”). (Motions, Trevillyan Decl., Exh. 1.) To date, Defendant has not served responses to the discovery. (Id. at ¶2.) Plaintiff filed the instant (1) Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted; and Request for Sanctions; (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; (3) Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; and (4) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, on November 26, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date.DiscussionMotions to Compel Initial Responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production, Sets OnePlaintiff moves to compel Defendant’s responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, consisting of 12 interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Set One, consisting of four interrogatories, and Requests for Production, Set One, consisting of 5 requests. The Motions are bought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300.Defendant’s responses to the discovery requests were not timely served within 30 days of service. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260, subd. (a); 2031.260, subd. (a); 2033.250, subd. (a).) The responses were not served as of the filing of these Motions on November 26, 2024. There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) Based on Defendant’s failure to timely respond to the propounded discovery, Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling service of verified responses to the discovery requests without objections.Defendant’s failure to timely respond to the interrogatories and requests for production constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 and have been properly noticed. However, the amount sought is excessive for straightforward and unopposed motions to compel initial discovery responses. Under a lodestar calculation, sanctions are granted against Defendant in the amount of $1,380.00 based on three hours of attorney time billed at $400.00 per hour, plus $180.00 in filing fees. (Motions, Trevillyan Decl., ¶6.)Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, AdmittedLikewise, there is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort before a motion to deem requests for admission can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the responding party fails to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) However, a motion to deem requests for admission admitted shall be denied if the Court “finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).) Accordingly, the Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted, is also granted. Sanctions must be awarded as mandated by Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c). An additional $460.00 in sanctions is awarded against Defendant.ConclusionPlaintiff Will T. Durant’s (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; (2) Motion to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; (3) Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; and are (4) Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, GRANTED.
