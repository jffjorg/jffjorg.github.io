 Case Number:  23STLC00815    Hearing Date:   January 15, 2025    Dept:  26 USAA Casualty Ins. Co. v. Woods, et al.,TENTATIVE RULING:Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff USAA Casualty Insurance Company’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents Sets One; and Request for Order Awarding Monetary Sanctions is CONTINUED TO FEBRUARY 4, 2025 AT 10:00 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY JANUARY 21, 2025, PLAINTIFF IS TO MAKE AN ADDITIONAL MOTION RESERVATION AND PAY THE REQUIRED FILING FEE.ANALYSIS:On December 13, 2024, Plaintiff USAA Casualty Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents Sets One; and Request for Order Awarding Monetary Sanctions. Specifically, Plaintiff requests an order compelling Defendant Jesus Mora (“Defendant Mora”) to provide initial responses to Form Interrogatories, Set No. One, and Request for Production of Documents, Set No. One. Plaintiff also requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,060.00. No opposition has been filed to date.DiscussionPlaintiff’s motion is two motions improperly combined into one: (1) a Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One; and (2) a Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production, Set One. Combining multiple motions under the guise of one motion with one hearing reservation manipulates the Court Reservation System and unfairly jumps ahead of other litigants. Moreover, combining motions to avoid payment of filing fees deprives the Court of filing fees it is otherwise entitled to collect. Statutorily required filing fees are jurisdictional and “it is mandatory for the court clerks to demand and receive statutorily required filing fees.” (See Duran v. St. Luke’s Hospital (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 457, 460.) Plaintiff’s motion, therefore, cannot be heard in full until an additional motion reservation is made and the corresponding filing fee is paid.ConclusionBased on the foregoing, Plaintiff USAA Casualty Insurance Company’s Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents Sets One; and Request for Order Awarding Monetary Sanctions is CONTINUED TO FEBRUARY 4, 2025 AT 10:00 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. BY JANUARY 21, 2025, PLAINTIFF IS TO MAKE AN ADDITIONAL MOTION RESERVATION AND PAY THE REQUIRED FILING FEE.Court clerk to give notice.
