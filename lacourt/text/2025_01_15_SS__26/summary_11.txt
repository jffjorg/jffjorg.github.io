And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to dismiss or stay the action. The defendant had argued that the forum selection clause in the Terms and Conditions of its website, which stated that disputes should be heard in the Superior Court of New York, New York County (Manhattan), should apply. However, the judge found that the defendant had not demonstrated that the plaintiffs agreed to these terms and conditions. The judge noted that the defendant's officer provided conflicting information about the terms and conditions, and that there was no evidence of any specific communications with the plaintiffs or their travel agent regarding the terms and conditions. As a result, the judge concluded that the defendant had not shown that the action should be dismissed or stayed pursuant to the forum selection clause. The defendant is ordered to file and serve its response pleading within 20 days of the order.
