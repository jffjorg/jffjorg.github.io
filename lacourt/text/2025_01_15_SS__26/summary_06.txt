And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to reclassify the case filed by Plaintiffs Rita Cuadros, Nancy Cuadros, and Veronica O'Hacer. The motion was filed on October 3, 2024, and the hearing was originally set for December 5, 2024, but was continued to January 15, 2025, to allow the Plaintiffs to demonstrate service of the moving papers and notice of the hearing date. However, the Plaintiffs failed to provide proof of service for Defendants Stoll, Cuadros, and Tompkins, which is a violation of statutory requirements and due process.

As a result, the Motion to Reclassify is denied. However, the Court finds that the case should be reclassified to an unlimited jurisdiction court due to the declaratory and injunctive relief sought in the Complaint and First Amended Complaint regarding the parties' rights and the placement of the headstone ordered for Plaintiffs' mother.

The case will be reclassified as an unlimited civil case and transferred to the Reclassification/Transfer Desk for collection of fees and reassignment to an unlimited jurisdiction court. The Plaintiffs are required to pay the reclassification fee within 10 days of this order.
