(“Defendant”). The action arises from Defendant’s alleged towing of a vehicle of which Plaintiff is the registered and legal owner, and refusal to return said vehicle until Plaintiff paid the storage fee. (Compl., ¶¶4-11.) Defendant filed a cross-complaint on April 23, 2024 alleging statutory violations and seeking declaratory relief regarding its statutory right to sell the subject motor vehicle to satisfy its lien for towing and storage fees. (See Cross-Compl., ¶¶18-24.) However, the Limited Jurisdiction Court lacks jurisdiction to issue the declaratory relief sought in the Cross-Complaint. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 85, 86.)Therefore, the Court sets an order to show cause regarding why this case should not be reclassified as an unlimited civil case and transferred to the Reclassification/Transfer Desk for collection of fees and reassignment of the case to an Independent Calendar Court.Court clerk to give notice.
