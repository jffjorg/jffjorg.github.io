 Case Number:  23STLC02642    Hearing Date:   January 15, 2025    Dept:  26 Dennis Block & Associates, APC v. Lee et al., TENTATIVE RULING:Defendant Charles Lee’s Motion to Vacate Default Judgment is GRANTED. THE ORDER ENTERED ON OCTOBER 17, 2024 IS VACATED. TRIAL IS RE-SET FOR APRIL 16, 2025 AT 8:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.ANALYSIS:On April 20, 2023, Plaintiff Dennis Block & Associates, APC (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendant Charles Lee (“Defendant”). Defendant filed an answer in propria persona on November 30, 2023. The case came for trial on October 17, 2024, at which time Defendant did not appear. (Minute Order, 10/17/24.) Plaintiff proved up its case and the Court found in its favor in the amount of $5,470.00, plus interest, and costs. (Ibid.) Plaintiff filed a proposed judgment, as ordered, on October 18, 2024.On November 19, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Vacate Default Judgment. No opposition has been filed to date.DiscussionThe Motion is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). An application for discretionary relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) must be made within a reasonable time, no more than six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought, and must be accompanied by an affidavit of fault attesting to the party’s excusable mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); English v. IKON Business Solutions (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 130, 143.) The motion must also be accompanied by a copy of the moving defendant’s proposed pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) This can be corrected if the defendant submits a proposed responsive pleading by the hearing date. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403.)The Motion was timely brought one month after the trial date and is accompanied by a declaration of fault from Defendant. Defendant declares that they did not know trial was set for October 17, 2024. (Motion, Lee Decl., ¶5.) Although the trial date was provided with the packet served with the Summons and Complaint, Defendant did not realize it was included in the thick pile of papers. (Ibid.) Also, at the time Defendant filed their answer, the clerk at the filing window said a notice of trial or notice of next procedure would be sent out. (Id. at ¶7.) No further notice was sent to Defendant alerting them of the upcoming trial date. (Ibid.) Accordingly, Defendant has demonstrated that their failure to appear for trial was the result of excusable mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect and relief from the judgment is warranted under the moving statute. The Court notes that although the motion is for relief from “default judgment,” there is no default in this case. This has no effect on the legal authority for relief.ConclusionDefendant Charles Lee’s Motion to Vacate Default Judgment is GRANTED. THE ORDER ENTERED ON OCTOBER 17, 2024 IS VACATED. TRIAL IS RE-SET FOR APRIL 16, 2025 AT 8:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE.Court clerk to give notice
