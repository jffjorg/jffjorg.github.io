And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the complaint is overruled. The defendant, Albertsons Companies, Inc. dba Pavilions, had argued that the action should be dismissed due to lack of jurisdiction and improper venue. The judge found that the defendant's demurrer was improperly combined with a motion to dismiss under Code of Civil Procedure section 392, and that the defendant had failed to provide admissible evidence that the subject property was located in Ventura County. The judge also found that the action was not subject to the venue provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 392, which concerns actions related to real property. As a result, the defendant is ordered to file and serve an answer to the complaint within 20 days of the ruling.
