Ming-Chao Huang, et
al. v. Michael Velcherean, Case No. 18STPB11082 (related to Case No.
19STCV01901)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
ON WHETHER TRIAL OF PROBATE CODE SEC. 259 CLAIM SHOULD BE SCHEDULED BEFORE OR
AFTER TRIAL OF CIVIL CASE   
Hearing Date: January
3, 2025, 8:30 a.m. 
 
BACKGROUND AND CONTENTIONS 
 
          At a
trial setting conference on November 27, 2024, the Court set a three-week jury
trial in the Civil Case to commence on September 15, 2025. At the same time,
the Court set the above-referenced hearing date for argument on whether the
claim in the Probate Case of the parents and sister of Decedent Amy Huang (“Amy”)
(Huang Family”) that Amy’s surviving spouse, Michael Velcherean (“MV”) be deemed
to have predeceased Amy under Probate Code (“PC”) sec. 259 should be before or
after trial of the Civil Case. 
 
          On
December 18, 2024, MV filed a brief why the PC sec. 259 issue should follow the
Civil trial. MV argues that hearing the PC issue (by the undersigned) before
the Civil trial would deprive MV of his right to a jury trial. More
specifically, MV takes issue with Huang Family’s acknowledgment that trial of
the PC 259 claim would have collateral estoppel effects on what would need to
be tried in the Civil Case. MV also takes note of comments of the bench
suggesting that the PC 259 claim proceed after the Civil trial. 
 
          On
December 23, 2024, Huang Family filed their Reply concerning the order of
trials. Huang Family argues that when these cases came to the undersigned for
trial they had argued that there should be one trial combining all issues but
that instead the Court adopted MV’s request that the Court try the will contest
before the civil case. Given that ruling, Huang Family argues that the Court
should now expeditiously complete the will contest trial by relying on the
evidence heard at that trial (and such other evidence as may be necessary) to
decide the PC 259 claim that the Court reserved for decision before conducting
the jury trial (and which may then have collateral estoppel effect in the Civil
case. (Roos v. Red (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 870, 879))[1] Huang
Family argues further that the various findings and rulings of the Court
adverse to MV warrant the Court now determining  the PC 259 claim against MV and thereby saving
all parties the time and costs involved in the Civil jury trial. (Estate of
Dito (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 791, 803) They argue also that MV
simply wants a  jury trial to have a
different trier of fact than the undersigned who has ruled already against him
on various issues. Relatedly, they argue that the right to jury trial does not
allow parties to relitigate issues already decided. (Roos, supra)  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
          “It is
well established that there is no right to jury trial in probate proceedings
unless provided for by statute….An exception to this rule permits a jury trial
when a probate statute provides for the formulation of issues of fact which,
under section 1230, give rise to a jury trial on those issues if otherwise
appropriate.” (Estate of Phelps (1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 332, 336-337
(citing 7 Witkin, Cal Procedure (3d ed), sec. 96 and Estate of Beach
(1975) 15 Cal.3d 623)) MV cites no statute requiring a jury trial for the PC
259 claim. However, MV may be entitled to a jury trial where the formulation of
factual issues to that end would otherwise be appropriate for a jury.[2] As
set forth in Phelps, supra:  
 
In Beach, the Supreme Court held there was no right to
a jury trial in an action claiming mismanagement of estate assets in the form
of objections to the executor’s first accounting. (§ 927.) The court in Beach rejected application of the line of cases
granting jury trials when the code permits the formulation of issues of fact. (Estate of Beach, supra, 15 Cal.3d at p. 642,
125 Cal.Rptr. 570, 542 P.2d 994.) The Beach court distinguished between those cases
presenting complex issues of accounting or involving the probate court’s
supervisorial powers over the executor’s management of the estate and cases
involving factual issues along the lines of those presented in a will contest;
e.g., questions of mental capacity or undue influence. The court held that a
jury trial was not available in the former class of cases but was available in
the latter. (Id. at p. 643, 125 Cal.Rptr. 570, 542 P.2d
994.)
 
223 Cal.App.3d at 338. Beach was
followed by Heiser v. Sup. Ct (1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 276 concerning a
petition under the predecessor version of PC se. 850. As summarized in Phelps,
supra: 
 
Although noting that section 851.5 did not
provide for jury trials, the court observed: “Section 1230 [cf. § 1280] has
been held to provide for the right of jury trial in ‘ “... those cases in which
the code has expressly authorized issues of fact to be framed.” ’… After
reviewing the Supreme Court’s decision in Estate of Beach, supra, 15 Cal.3d 623, 125 Cal.Rptr. 570, 542 P.2d 994, the Heiser court concluded that “in addition to a
statutory provision for the joining or framing of factual issues, such issues
must be appropriate for jury determination.” (Heiser v. Superior Court, supra, 88
Cal.App.3d at p. 279, 151 Cal.Rptr. 745.) The Heiser court went on to say that: “[J]ury trials are
not available in probate proceedings when such would risk undermining the
probate court’s supervisorial responsibilities or when the issue resembles an
accounting wherein it is impractical for a jury to wade through a mass of figures. Jury trials are appropriate, however,
when the issues involve such things as standard of conduct, mental capacity
[citations], or credibility of witnesses.”… Thus, we interpret Heiser as preserving the right to a jury trial under
section 9860 only to the extent that the right to jury
trial would exist if the action were being tried outside of probate. Similarly,
we conclude that section 1280 does not confer a greater right to jury trial
than would exist in a nonprobate matter. It does no more than recognize that
the right to jury, if it otherwise exists, is
not lost because the proceeding occurs in probate. In the case before us,
therefore, we must analyze the right to a jury trial by examining the
underlying nature of the action.
 
223 Cal.App.3d at 338-340.
 
         Whether
there was dependent adult abuse is an issue that absent a probate case would likely
be one for which MV would be entitled to a jury in a civil context. A cause of
action for damages (as opposed to disentitlement from an estate of amounts
derived from abuse) based on financial elder or dependent adult abuse under
Welfare & Institutions Code sec. 15657.5 is one for a jury. (See
e.g., Conservatorship of Gregory (2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 514,
CACI 3100, et al) Similarly, per Phelps, “standard of conduct [alleged abuse], mental
capacity [or at least undue influence], and credibility of witnesses” are
central to this claim. A claim under PC 259 is not the same as a will contest
that is routinely heard without a jury as part of the probate process (and
hence was one of the reasons why that contest was decided already in this case)
or otherwise involve the supervisory responsibilities of a probate court as in
an accounting. Regardless, whether MV is entitled to a jury trial of the PC 259
claim under Estate of Beach, the issue here is easier: only whether to
defer the PC 259 claim until after hearing the jury trial. In this regard,
Probate Code sec. 854 is relevant: 
 
          Probate
Code sec. 854 provides: “If a civil action is pending with respect to the
subject matter of a petition filed pursuant to this chapter this part and
jurisdiction has been obtained in the court where the civil action is pending
prior to the filing of the petition, upon request of any party to the civil
action, the court shall abate the petition until the conclusion of the civil
action. This section shall not apply if the court finds that the civil action
was filed for the purpose of delay.” 
 
          Huang Family
filed their complaint in the Civil case on January 22, 2019. MV filed a notice
of posting jury fees on May 3, 2019. MV filed his cross-complaint on February
1, 2021. The Civil Case has cross claims for damages against MV and Huang
Family for Amy’s wrongful death, as well as for dependent adult abuse against
MV. By contrast, in the Probate Case, Huang Family filed their petition under
PC sec. 850 (including for a determination contesting Amy’s Wills) until
November 16, 2020. Huang Family filed their Response and Objection (Will
Contest) to MV’s amended petition for probate of wills on January 18, 2024.[3]  
 
          Based on
these filing dates, jurisdiction had been obtained in the Civil Case prior to
what Huang Family contends is its operative petition in the Probate case.[4] MV
has in effect requested the Court “abate” the Probate case until a jury hears
the civil case – consistent with the position he took at the initial status
conference before the undersigned. The Court does not find that the civil case
was filed for the purpose of delay. Indeed, MV did not file the civil case –
Huang Family did so. MV has a Constitutional right to have a jury hear Huang Family’s
complaint for damages – even leaving aside his own cross-complaint filed after
Huang Family’s petition was filed. The Court also does not find that MV now seeking
a jury trial – consistent with his posting jury fees back in 2019 – was for the
purpose of delay. 
 
          As
discussed above, the subject matter of the civil case is substantially related
to the subject matter of the PC sec. 259 claim. Sec. 259 is determined based in
part on whether there was abuse of a dependent adult. The civil case also
concerns whether there was dependent adult abuse – even if it is in the context
of a claim for damages as opposed to determining what MV is entitled to from
Amy’s estate. Huang Family does not argue otherwise.  
 
          For these
reasons, abatement of the PC sec. 259 claim is applicable here and requires
that the PC sec. 259 claim be tried after trial of the civil case, consistent
also with Beach, supra. (See also Conservatorship of Pacheco
(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 171)
 
          That in
deciding the will contest the Court reserved the issue of PC sec. 259 (and
interpretation of the will) should not be construed, as Huang Family does, that
determining the applicability of sec. 259 is some proposed fourth phase of the
will contest trial. The Court has decided the will contest. Determination of
the applicability of sec. 259 is based on the Huang Family’s separate PC sec.
850 petition. See also Dito, supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at
803 (“a section 259 claim [to be free from abuse] is distinct from, and
unrelated to, a claim that an omitted spouse is entitled to a share of the
estate.”) The factual issues may overlap but they are separate petitions with
different considerations. 
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
          For these
reasons, including under the Constitution, the Court determines that the jury
trial of the Civil case must proceed before the PC 259 claim, efficiencies
notwithstanding. That said, the parties should be prepared to discuss at the
hearing whether the PC 259 claim can be decided at the end of the civil trial,
whether by the Court or the jury, based on the evidence submitted at that trial,
without delay. (See Corder v. Corder (2007) 41 Cal.4th
644 (concerning ability of court to allocate award for wrongful death without curtailing
parties’ right to jury trial))  
 
          The Court
also does not now decide what collateral estoppel effect, if any, prior rulings
or findings may have on the civil trial that may mitigate the Huang Family’s
concerns about the time and costs involved in the need to have multiple trials
in these related cases.
