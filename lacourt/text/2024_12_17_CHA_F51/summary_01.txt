```

Summary:

The tentative ruling is a response to a demurrer filed by Cross-Defendant, Linda Romney, against Cross-Complainant, sPower LLC. The demurrer challenges the sufficiency of the pleading and argues that the claims are time-barred by the statute of limitations. The court finds that the demurrer is overruled, and Cross-Defendant must file and serve her answer to Cross-Complainant's cross-complaint within 20 days.

The court focuses on Cross-Complainant's first, second, and fourth causes of action, which allege breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and unjust enrichment, respectively. The court finds that these claims are not time-barred and that Cross-Defendant's arguments against them are insufficient.

The court also addresses Cross-Defendant's argument that Cross-Complainant has unclean hands and is barred from relief due to intentional delay. The court finds that this argument is without merit and that the doctrine of laches is inapplicable to contract claims.

Overall, the tentative ruling is in favor of Cross-Complainant and requires Cross-Defendant to respond to the cross-complaint within a specified timeframe.
