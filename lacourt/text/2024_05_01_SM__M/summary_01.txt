And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Plaintiffs, Antonio Marasco, Theresa Marasco, Holly Burns, and Simon Valenzuela, have moved for an order to interplead certain settlement funds with the Court. They claim that Zhana Azizzadeh and Arpa Rostami from the Metis Law Group, and Attorney Whitney Ackerman, purport to have a lien on the settlement funds. The Plaintiffs seek a declaration as to the validity and enforceability of their former attorneys' liens and entitlement to the settlement proceeds from this action. However, the Plaintiffs have failed to establish that the Court has jurisdiction to adjudicate their former attorneys' contract or equitable claims in this matter.

The Judge rules that the motion is DENIED. The Court lacks jurisdiction to determine the validity of the former attorneys' liens and entitlement to the settlement proceeds. The Plaintiffs' former attorneys are not parties to this action and lack any right to intervene in this action.
