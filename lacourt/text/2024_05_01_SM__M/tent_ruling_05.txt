al., v. San Remo Ent LP, et al.
CASE NO.:                23SMCV05547
MOTION:                  Motion
to Compel Initial Discovery Responses
HEARING DATE:   5/1/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to
serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (CCP § 2030.290(b).) The
statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have
been served. All that need be shown in the moving papers is that a set of
interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to
respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. (Leach
v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
Analysis
 
            Plaintiff Sybil Juni moves to compel
Defendant Bruce King to provide responses to Plaintiff’s Special
Interrogatories, Set One, without objections, which were served on defendant on
January 1, 2024, and responses became due on February 2, 2024. Defendants
provide compelling evidence that Defendant King served responsive objections on
January 26, 2024. (Roth Decl., Ex. 1.) Since Plaintiff received a response,
Plaintiff should have filed a motion to compel a further response. Such motions
have additional procedural requirements which have not been met here, including
a separate statement.  Accordingly, the
motion is DENIED.
 
Monetary sanctions are mandatory,
unless the imposition of sanctions would be unjust or the party subject to the
sanctions acted with substantial justification. (CCP § 2030.290(c).) Plaintiff
fails to justify why she filed the instant motion, despite receiving responses
from King. As such, sanctions are mandatory.           
 
Defendant claims $5,000.00 in
sanctions for attorneys’ fees, plus $1,000.00 in sanctions for counsels’
misrepresentations on the record of this motion. As to discretionary sanctions,
the Court declines to issue discretionary sanctions against counsel. 
 
As to mandatory sanctions, the
Court finds the attorneys’ fees request to be unreasonable. Counsel claims 10
hours of attorney-time at $500/hr. for opposing this motion. An opposition to
this simple and baseless motion to compel initial responses did not warrant 10
hours of time. Based on the record of the motion, the Court finds that a
reasonable fee in this instance would be $2,500.00. Accordingly, Defendant’s
request for sanctions is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $2,500.00 against Plaintiff’s
counsel of record, Michael R. Dufour, only. Sanctions to be paid to defense
counsel within 30 days.
