```

And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The defendant, Kian Beroukhim, moves to set aside the default entered against him. He argues that the default was taken as a result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The court finds that the procedural record shows good cause for relief, as the defendant has been actively participating in the action for over two years and timely moved for relief once he realized his default was taken. However, the defendant failed to provide any evidence supporting his claim of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, and he did not submit a proposed responsive pleading as required by law. Therefore, the motion is denied.
