to Vacate Default/Default Judgment
HEARING DATE:   5/1/24
 
Legal
Standard
 
Relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b)
is either discretionary or mandatory. Where a party cannot obtain an attorney
affidavit of fault, the party may seek discretionary relief under section
473(b) due to “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (CCP §
473(b).) A motion for discretionary relief must be made “within a reasonable
time but in no instance exceeding six months after the judgment, dismissal,
order, or proceeding was taken.” (Id.) If discretionary relief is granted, the
court may in its discretion order the moving party to pay the costs, including
attorney fees, incurred in obtaining the default. (Rogalski v. Nabers
Cadillac (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 816, 823; Vanderkous v. Conley (2010)
188 Cal.App.4th 111, 118-119.) If the motion for discretionary relief is
granted, the court may order the offending attorney to pay monetary sanctions
up to $1,000 to opposing parties, or up to $1,000 to the State Bar Client
Security Fund, or “[g]rant other relief as is appropriate.” (CCP §
473(c)(1)(A), (B), (C).)
 
Analysis
            
            Defendant
Kian Beroukhim moves to set aside the default entered against him. (CCP §
473(b). Defendant argues that his default was taken as a result of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect. On November 1, 2022, Defendant filed a demurrer to the first amended
complaint (FAC) via counsel. Prior to the hearing on the demurrer, counsel withdrew,
and Defendant substituted in pro per. At the hearing on demurrer on September
27, 2023, the Court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend. Plaintiff
timely filed and served the operative second amended complaint (SAC) on October
12, 2023. Defendant failed to file a responsive pleading. Plaintiff requested a
default against Defendant on November 20, 2023. The clerk entered the default. Defendant
asserts that, at the time the Court sustained the demurrer, Defendant was not
represented and did not understand that he needed to answer the amended
complaint.
 
The procedural record alone shows
good cause for relief. Defendant has been actively participating in this action
for over two years. Defendant timely moved for relief once he realized his
default was taken.  Thus, discretionary
relief might be appropriate. That said, Defendant has not met the procedural
requirements for relief. Defendant has not provided any declaration supporting
his mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The Court cannot grant the motion
without such evidence. Further, a motion for relief under section 473(b) “shall
be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted . . ..” (CCP § 473(b); but see Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403
[finding substantial compliance where counsel offered proposed answer at
motion hearing rather than serving it with moving papers].)  Defendant failed to submit a proposed responsive
pleading.  Therefore, the motion is
DENIED.
