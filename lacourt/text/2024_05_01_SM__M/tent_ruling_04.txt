Legal
Standard
 
            A
demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.
(Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the
allegations liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co.
(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (CCP §§
430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only allege ultimate
facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis for the claim
against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie
(1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the
construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore Land Co. v. Petersen
(1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations omitted.)
 
            A
special demurrer for uncertainty is disfavored and will only be sustained where
the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot
reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or
claims are directed against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s
of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if
the pleading is somewhat vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern
discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)

 
            “Liberality in permitting amendment
is the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to
show in what manner plaintiff can amend the complaint,
and how that amendment will change the legal effect of the
pleading. (Id.)
 
Analysis
 
Defendant the City of Inglewood demurs to Plaintiff’s complaint. Defendant
argues that the complaint is uncertain, fails to allege a statutory basis upon
which Defendant City of Inglewood can be found liable, and fails to comply with
the Government Tort Claims Act. In response, Plaintiff filed a paper labelled as
an amended complaint. Upon inspection, the filing is not an amended complaint,
but a substantive opposition to the demurrer. The Court will therefore treat it
as such.
 
Government tort claims apply to both tort and contract claims against
state and local public agencies. (Gov. Code §§ 905, 905.2, 945.4; see also Baines
Pickwick Ltd. v. City of Los Angeles (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 298, 303 – 304.)
Such claims must be pled with particularity, so that they state every fact
essential to the existence of statutory liability, they identify the statute
claimed to establish the liability, and they plead facts sufficient to show
that the cause of action lies outside any applicable statutory immunity. (Susman
v. City of Los Angeles (1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 803, 809.) 
 
Any claim against a government entity must be grounded in statute. (Gov.
Code § 815; E.L. White, Inc. v. City of Huntington Beach (1978) 21
Cal.3d 497, 512, fn. 9.) “[D]irect tort
liability of public entities must be based on a specific statute declaring them
to be liable, or at least creating some specific duty of care, and not on the
general tort provisions of Civil Code section 1714. Otherwise, the general rule
of immunity for public entities would be largely eroded by the routine
application of general tort principles.” (Eastburn v. Regional Fire
Protection Authority (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1175, 1183.) Because the duty of a governmental agency can
only be created by statute, the statute must be identified. (Searcy v. Hemet
Unified School Dist. (1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 792, 802.)
 
            Here, the complaint does not
identify any statutory basis for the stated claims. In opposition, Plaintiff
only reiterates the allegations of the complaint. Plaintiff does not identify
any statute or enactment that provides liability. Moreover, the Court agrees
that the complaint is uncertain. The complaint alleges a sole cause of action
for breach of contract, yet does not allege the existence of any contract.
Instead, the complaint only alleges that the police department would not
enforce a custody order against the father, Michael Howard. (See Compl., pp.
3-5.) The complaint is completely uncertain as to what counts or claims are
directed against Defendant based on the pled inactions.
 
The Court, however, believes that the claim presentation requirement is sufficiently
pled. Where compliance with the Tort Claims Act is required, the pleaded claims
must allege compliance or circumstances excusing compliance. (Snipes v. City
of Bakersfield (1983) 145 Cal. App. 3d 861, 865.) The claim presentation
requirement may be generally alleged.  (Esparza
v. Kaweah Delta District Hospital (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 547, 554; see Perez
v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1237.) The Esparza
Court held that plaintiff’s allegation that she “ ‘complied with applicable
claims statutes’ is reasonably interpreted as meaning the claim was timely” and
that “the ultimate fact of compliance with the claims presentation requirement
in the Government Claims Act can be pled using a general allegation.” (Id.
at 554-555, fn. 4.) Simply checking the box on the form complaint is sufficient
for pleading purposes. (See Compl., ¶ 5a.) Moreover, the evidentiary
declaration filed by the City cannot be considered on demurrer. (Thompson
Decl.)
 
Accordingly, the demurrer is SUSTAINED with 10 days leave to amend.
