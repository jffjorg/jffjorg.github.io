And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Regency Holt, LLC's motion to strike the cross-complaint filed by Cross-Complainants Avroham Fox, Dahlia Fox, and Yosef Fox. Regency Holt, LLC argued that the cross-complaint arises from protected activity, specifically Regency Holt, LLC's commencement of an unlawful detainer action against Cross-Complainants. However, the court found that the gravamen of the cross-complaint seeks liability based on statutory violations, not protected activity. The court held that Regency Holt, LLC failed to meet its burden to identify specific allegations of protected activity and claims arising from it. As a result, the court denied the motion to strike the cross-complaint in its entirety.
