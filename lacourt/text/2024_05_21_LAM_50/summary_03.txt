And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Teresa A. Beaudet, discloses her own potential bias in this case, as she and her husband purchased a pickup truck 24 years ago that had electrical problems. The manufacturer and dealer eventually agreed to refund the purchase price. The judge does not believe this experience will cause her to be biased, but if parties disagree, they must file and serve a statement of disqualification within 14 calendar days. The hearing on the status conference will be continued to July 30, 2024, unless both parties waive the right to file the statement.
