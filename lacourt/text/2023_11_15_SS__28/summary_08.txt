And here is the English-text summary:

The judge issues a tentative ruling denying the motion to consolidate two cases, 22STCV11346 and 23CHCV01767, filed by plaintiff Michael Patrick O'Connell. The cases are related and assigned to Department 28, but the motion to consolidate was filed in only one of the cases, 23CHCV01767, and does not comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a). The judge finds that the motion lacks a notice of motion to consolidate filed in case number 22STCV11346 and that the supporting papers were not filed in the lowest numbered case. Therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice, and the moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling and to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
