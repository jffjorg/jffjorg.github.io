Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies Topa Insurance Company's motion to quash a deposition subpoena served by Plaintiff Jose Munoz. Topa Insurance Company objected to the subpoena on various grounds, including that the information sought is privileged or protected by attorney-client privilege, and that the discovery requests are overly broad and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The Judge found that Topa Insurance Company's arguments lacked merit and that the discovery requests are relevant and reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The Judge also denied Plaintiff's request for sanctions.
