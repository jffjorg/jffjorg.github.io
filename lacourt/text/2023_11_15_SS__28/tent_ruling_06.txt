LEGAL STANDARD 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2032.610 provides: 
“(a) If a party submits to, or produces another for, a
physical or mental examination in compliance with a demand under Article 2
(commencing with Section 2032.210), an order of court under Article 3
(commencing with Section 2032.310), or an agreement under Section 2016.030,
that party has the option of making a written demand that the party at whose
instance the examination was made deliver both of the following to the
demanding party: 
“(1) A copy of a detailed written report setting out
the history, examinations, findings, including the results of all tests made,
diagnoses, prognoses, and conclusions of the examiner. 
“(2) A copy of reports of all earlier examinations of
the same condition of the examinee made by that or any other examiner. 
“(b) If the option under subdivision (a) is exercised,
a copy of the requested reports shall be delivered within 30 days after service
of the demand, or within 15 days of trial, whichever is earlier. 
“(c) In the circumstances described in subdivision
(a), the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010) is waived, both for the examiner’s writings and reports and to the
taking of the examiner’s testimony.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2032.610.) 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2032.620 provides: 
“(a) If the party at whose instance an examination was
made fails to make a timely delivery of the reports demanded under Section
2032.610, the demanding party may move for an order compelling their delivery.
This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040. 
“(b) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel delivery of
medical reports under this section, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
“(c) If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
delivery of demanded medical reports, the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In
lieu of or in addition to those sanctions, the court may impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). The court shall
exclude at trial the testimony of any examiner whose report has not been
provided by a party.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.620.) 
DISCUSSION 
On
June 27, 2023, Defendants’ expert neurologist Edwin Amos, M.D., examined Choi
at a scheduled medical examination requested by Defendants.  Choi’s counsel made
a written demand for a report or reports, record reviews and any writing
generated by Dr. Amos under Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.610.  Choi’s counsel
requested that Dr. Amos provide a detailed report setting out “the history,
examinations, findings, including the results of all tests made, diagnoses,
prognoses, and conclusions of the examiner.” 
(Soofer Dec. ¶¶ 3-5.) 
On
July 26, 2023, Defendants’ counsel served Dr. Amos’s report on Choi’s
counsel.  Choi’s counsel informed
Defendants’ counsel that the report was not code compliant and requested a
proper report. (Soofer Dec. ¶¶ 5-11.)   Choi now asks the Court to compel Dr. Amos to
submit a code-compliant report, arguing Dr. Amos has not provided “diagnoses,
prognoses, and conclusions of the examiner.” 
(Reply p. 2.) 
In
their opposition, Defendants argue that Dr. Amos’s report complies with the requirements
of Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.610 but his examinations, conclusions,
diagnoses, and prognoses are limited by the information that he had at the time. 
The
Court has reviewed Dr. Amos’s report and finds that it complies with the requirements
of Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.610. 
The Court denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Christina Choi’s motion to compel Dr. Amos to produce a
code-compliant defense medical examination report. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
