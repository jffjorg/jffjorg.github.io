COUNSEL’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff’s counsel, Michael M. Marzban, Cohen &
  Marzban, Law Corporation, requests to be relieved as counsel. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
  Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed
  to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
  form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without compromising
  the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under
  Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent
  under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in
  Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3)
  service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order
  on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the
  proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion
  to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw.  The motion should be granted if there is no
  prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.
  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) 
DISCUSSION 
Counsel has submitted completed MC-051, MC-052 and
  MC-053 forms. Counsel has provided a declaration stating: “Considerable
  differences of opinion regarding the handling of the instant action and other
  factors have arisen between Plaintiff and Cohen & Marzban, Law
  Corporation, so that counsel believes that Cohen & Marzban Law
  Corporation, can no longer continue to represent the Plaintiff in this
  action. The differences are such that Cohen & Marzban, Law Corporation,
  is unable to effectively represent the Plaintiff. In order not to waive the
  attorney client privilege counsel is unable to divulge the extent of the
  differences that have arisen.” 
Counsel states he served Plaintiff at her last known
  address via mail, confirmed via telephone. Counsel submitted proof of service
  on all parties, including Plaintiff. The Court grants the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Michael M. Marzban,
  Cohen & Marzban, Law Corporation. Counsel will be relieved upon filing proof of
  service on the client of the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved
  as Counsel--Civil (Judicial Council form MC-053). 
Counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Counsel is ordered to file the proof of service of
  this ruling with the Court within five days.
