And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment against defendant Shawn Williams. The plaintiff, Allstate Property and Casualty Insurance Company, sought a default judgment against Williams for motor vehicle negligence and damages of $114,272.20. However, the court found that the plaintiff's declaration submitted in support of the request for default judgment lacked sufficient information to support the request. Specifically, the declaration did not provide a police report, did not explain the items paid for, the need for the payments, the reasonableness of the payments, or the connection between the payments and Williams's tortious conduct. The court ruled that the relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint, and that the court must hear the evidence offered by the plaintiff and render judgment in the plaintiff's favor for that relief, not exceeding the amount stated in the complaint, as appears by the evidence to be just.
