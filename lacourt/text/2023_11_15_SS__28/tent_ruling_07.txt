 Case Number:  22STCV27877    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2023    Dept:  28 


Having
  considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
  August 26, 2022, Plaintiff Anthony Holt (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
  against Defendants Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority
  (“LACMTA”), City of Long Beach (“City”), County of Los Angeles (“County”), California
  Department of Transportation, and Does 1-50 for dangerous condition of public
  property under Government Code section 815.2 and Vehicle Code section 17001. 
On
  October 20, 2022, the City filed an answer. On October 28, 2022, the County
  filed an answer.  On October 31, 2022, Defendant
  The People of the State of California, acting by and through the Department
  of Transportation, erroneously sued as California Department of
  Transportation (“State”), filed an answer. On November 21, 2022, LACMTA filed
  an answer. 
On
  April 13, 2023, the Court dismissed the County without prejudice at
  Plaintiff’s request. On May 11, 2023, the Court dismissed the State without
  prejudice at Plaintiff’s request. 
On
  October 18, 2023, Plaintiff's counsel, Steven Ross, Downtown LA Law Group, LLP,
  filed a motion to be relieved as counsel to be heard on November 15, 2023. 
Trial
  is currently scheduled for February 23, 2024. 
COUNSEL’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff’s
  counsel, Steven Ross, Downtown LA Law Group, LLP, requests to be relieved as
  counsel. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
California
  Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1)
  notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice
  of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a
  declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality
  of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil
  Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of
  Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's
  Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice
  of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order on the client and all
  other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order
  relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be
  Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
The
  court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw.  The motion should be granted if there is no
  prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.
  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) 
DISCUSSION 
Counsel
  has submitted completed MC-051, MC-052 and MC-053 forms. Counsel has provided
  a declaration stating: “The
  attorney-client relationship (ie: communication) has broken down and
  differences have arisen such that the firm of Downtown LA Law Group, LLP, can
  no longer continue representation. Request has been made upon Plaintiff to
  cooperate with the prosecution of his case but Plaintiff has not done so.” 
Counsel
  states that he served Plaintiff at his last known address by mail. Counsel
  was unable to confirm the address but made efforts to confirm by calling
  Plaintiff and conducting a locate search. 
However,
  counsel did not serve all parties that have appeared in this case. Counsel’s
  proof of service lists Plaintiff and LACMTA but does not include the City, which has appeared in
  the case and has not been dismissed.  Counsel
  must serve the City with notice under California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d). 
The
  Court continues the hearing on the motion to allow counsel to serve all
  parties that have appeared. 
CONCLUSION 
The
  Court CONTNUES the motion of Steven Ross, Downtown LA Law Group, LLP, counsel
  for Plaintiff Anthony Holt, to be relieved as counsel to November 30, 2023, at 1:30 p.m. in Department 28
  of the Spring Street Courthouse. 
Counsel
  is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Counsel
  is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
  five days.
