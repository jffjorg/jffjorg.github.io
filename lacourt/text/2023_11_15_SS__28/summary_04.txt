And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the case and has made a ruling. Plaintiff Valerie Roberts filed an action against defendants Kimberlee "Kim" White, Dan Brown, and Synergy Interactive LLC (Synergy) for negligence, strict liability, gross negligence and/or recklessness and premises liability. Synergy filed a motion to strike the complaint, which was granted. The plaintiff then filed an amended complaint. The court denied Synergy's motion to strike the amended complaint.

The case has proceeded with multiple amended complaints, answers, and cross-complaints. The court has granted summary judgment for Synergy and Brown on the plaintiff's complaint.

The plaintiff's counsel, Michael M. Marzban, has filed a motion to be relieved as counsel. The judge has granted the motion, citing the court's discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw as counsel. The judge has ordered the counsel to give notice of the ruling and to file proof of service of the ruling with the court within five days.
