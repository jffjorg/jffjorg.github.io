 Case Number:  21STCV26659    Hearing Date:   November 15, 2023    Dept:  28 


            Having considered the moving and opposing papers,
  the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
 On July 20, 2021, Plaintiff
  Maricel Pitcher (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Joseph
  Fahr, D.D.S., doing business as Beautiful Smith Dental Center, and Does 1-10
  for dental malpractice. 
 On September 7, 2021,
  Defendant, Joseph Peyman Fahr, D.D.S. (erroneously named and sued as Joseph
  Fahr, DDS, doing business as Beautiful Smile Dental Center) (“Defendant”)
  filed an answer. 
 On April 28, 2022, the
  Court granted Defendant’s motions to compel further discovery responses. The
  Court ordered Plaintiff to serve further discovery responses and pay
  Defendant $2,600 in sanctions by May 26, 2022. 
 On July 6, 2022, the Court
  found that Plaintiff had not fully complied with the Court’s April 28, 2022,
  order. The Court ordered Plaintiff to provide verified responses to Special
  Interrogatory Nos. 12 and 14 and code-compliant responses to Requests for Production
  Nos. 1, 3, 4, and 11 (indicating that Plaintiff has made a diligent search
  and a reasonable inquiry to locate the items requested (Code Civ. Proc., §
  2031.230)) by July 21, 2022. In addition, the Court ordered Plaintiff and her
  counsel to pay Defendant $2,510 in sanctions by August 6, 2022.  The Court denied Defendant’s request for
  terminating sanctions. 
 On September 29, 2023, the
  Court found that Plaintiff had not complied with the Court’s April 28, 2022
  order to pay Defendant $2,600.00 in sanctions by May 26, 2022 and had not
  shown good cause or substantial justification for the failure to pay these
  amounts.  The Court granted Defendant’s
  request to impose additional sanctions to penalize Plaintiff for disobeying
  the Court’s April 28, 2022 order and ordered Plaintiff to pay the Court $500
  in sanctions by October 30, 2023. 
 On August 29, 2023, Defendant
  filed motions (1) to compel further responses to request for production of
  documents, set five and (2) to compel further responses to special
  interrogatories, set five.  The motions
  were set to be heard on November 15, 2023. 
  On November 7, 2023, Defendant filed notices of non-opposition stating
  that Plaintiff had failed to file oppositions by the filing deadline.  On November 9, 2023,
  Plaintiff filed oppositions to the motions. 
 On November 6, 2023,
  counsel for the parties participated in an Informal Discovery Conference with
  the Court. 
 Trial is currently
  scheduled for March 28, 2024. 
PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS 
 A.      Informal Discovery Conference 
 The Eighth Amended Standing
  Order for Procedures in the Personal Injury Hub Courts Effective October 10,
  2022 (Filed September 20, 2022), ¶ 9E, provides: “PI Hub Courts will not hear
  Motions to Compel Further Discovery Responses to Discovery until the parties
  have engaged in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC).  PI Hub Courts may deny or continue a Motion
  to Compel Further Responses to Discovery if parties fail to schedule and
  complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on a Motion to Compel Further
  Responses to Discovery.” 
 The parties participated in
  an IDC on November 6, 2023. 
 B.       Timeliness of motions 
 A notice of motion to
  compel further responses must be given within 45 days of the service of the
  responses, or any supplemental responses, or on or before any specific later
  date to which the parties have agreed in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
  2030.300, subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (c).) Failure to file a motion within
  this time period constitutes a waiver of any right to compel further responses
  to requests for production of documents and interrogatories. 
 Defendants filed the
  motions on August 29, 2023.  Plaintiff does not dispute the timeliness of the motions. 
 C.   Meet and confer 
 “A motion to compel must be
  accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Code of Civil Procedure
  section 2016.040.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
  §§ 2030.300, subd. (b)(1); 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)  “A meet and confer declaration must state
  facts showing a reasonable and good-faith attempt at an informal resolution
  of each issue presented by the motion.” 
  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.)  
 Defendant has satisfied his
  meet and confer obligation. 
 D.      Separate statement 
 With exceptions that do not
  apply here, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345, requires that any motion
  involving the content of discovery contain a separate statement with the text
  of each request, the response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons
  for why an order compelling further responses is warranted.  
 Defendant filed separate statements
  for both motions. 
APPLICABLE LAW 
 A.      Inspection demand 
 “(a)
  On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
  sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further
  response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following
  apply: 
 “(1)
  A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete. 
 “(2)
  A representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or
  evasive. 
 “(3)
  An objection in the response is without merit or too general. 
 “(b)
  A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with each of the following: 
 “(1)
  The motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
  discovery sought by the demand. 
 “(2)
  The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under
  Section 2016.040. 
 “(3)
  In lieu of a separate statement required under the California Rules of Court,
  the court may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the
  discovery request and each response in dispute. 
 “(c)
  Unless notice of this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the
  verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any
  specific later date to which the demanding party and the responding party
  have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any right to compel a
  further response to the demand. 
 *
  * *
 “(h)
  Except as provided in subdivision (j), the court shall impose a monetary
  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any
  party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
  compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to
  the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
  make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
  subds. (a), (b), (c), (h).) 
 Code of Civil Procedure
  section 2031.230 provides: 
 “A
  representation of inability to comply with the particular demand for
  inspection, copying, testing, or sampling shall affirm that a diligent search
  and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with that
  demand. This statement shall also specify whether the inability to comply is
  because the particular item or category has never existed, has been
  destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no
  longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding party. The
  statement shall set forth the name and address of any natural person or
  organization known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or
  control of that item or category of item.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.230.) 
 B.       Interrogatories 
 Code of Civil Procedure
  section 2030.300, subdivision (a) provides:         
 “On
  receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for
  an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that
  any of the following apply: 
 “(1)
  An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. 
 “(2)
  An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
  unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate. 
 “(3)
  An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
  2030.300, subd. (a).) 
 Code of Civil Procedure
  section 2030.220, subdivision (c), provides: 
 “If
  the responding party does not have personal knowledge sufficient to respond
  fully to an interrogatory, that party shall so state, but shall make a
  reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information by inquiry to
  other natural persons or organizations, except where the information is
  equally available to the propounding party.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.220,
  subd. (c).) 
 C.    Discovery sanctions 
 “The court may impose a
  monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery
  process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable
  expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that
  conduct. The court may also impose this sanction on one unsuccessfully
  asserting that another has engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or
  on any attorney who advised that assertion, or on both. If a monetary
  sanction is authorized by any provision of this title, the court shall impose
  that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
  substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
  the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ.
  Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
 “Misuses of the discovery
  process include . . .   * * * “(d) Failing to respond or
  to submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
  2023.010.) 
I.        Defendant’s
  motion to compel further responses to demand for production of documents, set
  five 
Propounded: April 30, 2023
Responses:   July 17, 2023 
 In a declaration supporting
  Plaintiff’s opposition, Plaintiff’s counsel asserts that on September 28,
  2023, he provided further responses to the request for production of
  documents.  Plaintiff’s counsel has attached
  to his declaration, as Exhibit A, an undated document titled “Responses to
  Request for Production and Inspection of Documents” which appears to contain the deficient responses served on July 17, 2023.  The proof of service attached to the
  document is titled “Amended Response to Production of Documents” and is dated
  September 28, 2023.  The Court is not
  persuaded that Plaintiff supplemented her discovery responses on September
  28, 2023 as Plaintiff’s counsel contends.
