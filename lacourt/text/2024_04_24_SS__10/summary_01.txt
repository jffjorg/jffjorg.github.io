And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the defense motion to compel the plaintiff to sign a settlement agreement. The plaintiff signed the resolution protocol, but failed to sign the settlement agreement. The defendant seeks to compel the plaintiff to sign the agreement. The Court finds that the plaintiff's claims have been resolved, and the settlement agreement is binding and enforceable. The Court will enter a judgment in the plaintiff's favor for $590,000, and will not order the plaintiff to sign the settlement agreement. Instead, the Court may appoint an elisor to execute the settlement agreement on the plaintiff's behalf if the plaintiff fails to sign it.
