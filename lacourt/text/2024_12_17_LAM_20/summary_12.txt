Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Plaintiff, Kayvan Setareh, seeks to enforce his settlement with the Defendants, South Bay Contractors, Inc. and Mike Amidnamin. The parties entered into an initial settlement agreement stating that the Defendants owed $3.3 million and an amended settlement agreement requiring the Defendants to pay $2,722,337.90 to the Plaintiff by May 15, 2023. The amended agreement acknowledges a prior payment of $792,297.20 but states that amount will not be credited towards the amended principal. The Plaintiff contends that the Defendants failed to tender any further settlement funds. The Court finds that the parties entered into a valid and binding settlement and grants the Motion to Enforce Settlement. The Court rejects the Defendants' claims of mistake of fact and undue influence and finds that the Plaintiff's testimony is credible.
