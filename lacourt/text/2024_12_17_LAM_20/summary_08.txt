And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is in response to a breach of warranty of habitability case involving Plaintiffs Luis and Maria Caceres and Defendant Joe Nishanian. The Plaintiffs had sought default judgment against the Defendant, but the Court denied their application due to several errors. Specifically, the Complaint failed to specify the amount of damages, which is problematic under Code Civ. Proc. ยง 580. The Plaintiffs were ordered to either accept the jurisdictional minimum of $25,001 or amend the Complaint to specify damages. The Plaintiffs failed to remedy these errors and the Court will enter a default judgment in the amount of $25,000. The Doe Defendants are hereby dismissed.
