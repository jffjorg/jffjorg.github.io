Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer filed by Ford Motor Company to the 1st-5th causes of action is placed off calendar. This means that the demurrer will not be heard and will not be considered by the court. The reason for this is that the plaintiff, Maximilian I Webb, filed a First Amended Complaint nine days before the hearing, which renders the demurrer moot. The court relies on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 472(a) and 1005(b) to support this ruling.
