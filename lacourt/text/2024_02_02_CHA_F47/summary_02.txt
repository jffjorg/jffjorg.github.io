Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion for summary judgment and an interlocutory judgment for partition of a parcel of real property. The parties, Janet Louise Wilkes and Gary William Wilkes, are co-tenants of the property and have failed to agree on how to partition it. The judge grants the motion, finding that the parties each own an undivided one-half interest in the property and that the property cannot be evenly physically divided. The judge orders the property to be sold and the proceeds to be distributed according to the parties' ownership interests. The judge also appoints a referee to sell the property and will enter an interlocutory judgment after considering each party's position regarding the referee.
