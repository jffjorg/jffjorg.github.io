SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Janet Louise Wilkes,
Trustee of the Janet Louise Wilkes Living Trust (Plaintiff) and Defendant Gary
William Wilkes’ (Defendant) ownership of real property commonly known as
17622-17624 Los Alimos Street, Los Angeles, California (APN 2712-028-008) (the
Property) as co-tenants.  In 2022, the
parties began discussions to end their joint ownership of the property.  When they could not agree as to the purchase
price, on 7/12/22, Plaintiff filed this action for partition of the
property.  
 
On 11/9/23, Plaintiff filed and served the instant motion
seeking an order for summary judgment and an interlocutory judgment for
partition pursuant to CCP 437c(a) and CCP 872.720, in favor of Plaintiff, on
the grounds that Plaintiff and Defendant each own an undivided one-half
interest in the parcel of real property commonly known as 17622-17624 Los
Alimos Street, Los Angeles, California (APN 2712-028-008) (the Property), and
Plaintiff seeks to have the Property divided by partition.  Plaintiff seeks to have the Property sold and
to have the proceeds distributed pursuant to Plaintiff’s and Defendant’s
ownership interests in the Property, after payment of fees and costs.  
 
Plaintiff further seeks appointment of a referee to sell
the Property in accordance with CCP 873.010, et seq.  Plaintiff reserves and retains the right to
apportionment of costs, including attorneys’ fees incurred by her for the
common benefit, pursuant to CCP 874.010, 874.020, and 874.040.
 
On 1/5/24, this Court granted Defendant’s ex parte
application for an order continuing the hearing on this motion from
1/29/24.  (See 1/5/24 Minute
Order).  The Court ordered the hearing on
this motion continued to 2/2/24; however, the briefing schedule was ordered to
remain as to the original 1/29/24 hearing date. 
Id.
 
On 1/15/24, Defendant served his opposition to the motion
which was filed on 1/16/24 due to the 1/15/24 court holiday.  Plaintiff claims that the opposition was not
timely filed and, therefore, should not be considered by the Court.  Even if the opposition was filed late, it was
timely served 14 days before the original hearing date.  As such, Plaintiff suffered no prejudice as a
result of the opposition being filed on 1/16/24.  Therefore, the Court considered the
opposition in ruling on the merits of the motion.  See CRC 3.1300(d).  On 1/24/24, Plaintiff filed and served a
reply to the opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
The Court notes that Defendant has failed to
consecutively number his evidentiary objections as required.  See CRC 3.1354(b).  Regardless, Defendant’s objections to the
declaration of Brienna Cowen were considered and are sustained.
 
Plaintiff’s objections to the declaration of Gary William
Wilkes (numbers 1-14) are sustained.  
 
A party may move for summary judgment on the ground that
there is no defense to the action.  CCP
437c(a)(1).  A plaintiff meets his or her
burden of showing there is no defense to a cause of action if he or she has
proved each element of the cause of action entitling him or her to judgment on
that cause of action; once the plaintiff has met that burden, the burden shifts
to the defendant to show a triable issue of one or more material facts exists
as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.  CCP 437c(p)(1); Paramount Petroleum Corp.
(2014) 227 CA4th 226, 240-241.  A motion
for summary judgment must be granted if all the papers submitted show that
there is no triable issue as to any material fact and the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
CCP 437c(c).  
 
A co-owner of real property, such as Plaintiff, may bring
an action for partition.  LEG
Investments (2010) 183 CA4th 484, 493 citing CCP 872.210; Cummings
(2017) 13 CA5th 589, 596.  Additionally,
a co-owner has an absolute right to partition unless barred by a valid
waiver.  LEG Investments, supra
at 439 citing CP 872.710(b).  A court may
resolve a cause of action for partition on a motion for summary judgment and
enter an interlocutory judgment accordingly. See Williams (1967)
255 CA2d 648, 651.
 
There is no dispute that Plaintiff and Defendant each own
an undivided one-half interest in the
Property as tenants-in-common.  (Separate Statement (SS) 1-3).  Based on the configuration of the Property,
two duplexes plus one four car garage, there is also no dispute that the
Property cannot be evenly physically divided. 
(SS 4).  As such, partition in
kind cannot be equitably accomplished.  There
is no agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant relating to partition of the
Property.  (SS 5).  Nor is there any other agreement in place
with regard to partition of the Property. 
(SS 6).  As such, partition by
sale is warranted.  See CCP
872.820(b).
 
In opposition to the motion, Defendant does not dispute
any of the material facts set forth in the motion.  Rather, Defendant includes sixteen additional
facts which are not material to the issues in this case.  Further, Defendant does not argue that a
triable issue of material fact exists which warrants denial of the motion.  Instead, Defendant argues Plaintiff is not
entitled to the relief requested because she has failed to specify the scope of
the requested appointment of a referee to sell the Property and the motion is
premature because ordering a sale at this time could have a negative impact on
Defendant’s long-term financial planning and negative tax consequences for
Defendant.  The latter two issues are
irrelevant to Plaintiff’s right to partition of the Property.  
 
Defendant’s argument that the request for partition is
premature and/or insufficiently supported is also without merit.  
 
CCP 873.010 provides that with regard to ordering the
sale of property by partition, the Court shall appoint the referee and may determine
whether a referee’s bond is necessary, etc. 
CCP 873.610(b) provides that “[t]he court may refer the manner, terms,
and conditions of sale to the referee for recommendation but shall not approve
the referee's report except following a hearing upon noticed motion.”         
 
An interlocutory judgment for partition must include only
two elements: (1) a determination of the parties’ interests in the property and
an order granting the partition and (2) the manner of partition (i.e., a
physical division or sale of the property). 
Summers (2018) 24 CA5th 138, 143. 
As noted above, here, there is no dispute regarding Plaintiff’s and
Defendant’s interests in the property – Plaintiff and Defendant each own an
undivided 50% interest in the Property. 
(SS 1-2).  Further, the parties
agree that the Property cannot be equally divided.  (SS 4). 

 
As such, the Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to an
order granting the relief requested.   Thereafter, Plaintiff must submit a proposed
interlocutory judgment which the Court will enter after considering each
party’s position as to the specifics regarding the referee and making/ordering
any revisions the Court deems necessary. 
See CCP 872.820(b).  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted.
