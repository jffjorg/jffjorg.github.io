And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is in regards to a special motion to strike filed by Cross-Defendants L.A. Tire Tech, Inc. and Gerard Neglio against Cross-Complainant SiteOne Landscape Supply, LLC. The motion seeks to strike the 1st and 2nd causes of action in the cross-complaint. The Court finds that the motion is moot due to the filing of the First Amended Cross-Complaint by SiteOne in response to the Court's order sustaining L.A. Tire Tech's demurrer to the original cross-complaint with leave to amend. The Court notes that L.A. Tire Tech did not request that the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike be postponed in favor of ruling on the special motion to strike, and therefore the Court finds that the motion is moot.
