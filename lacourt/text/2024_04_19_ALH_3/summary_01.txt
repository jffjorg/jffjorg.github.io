And here is the English summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion for an order deeming their Requests for Admissions, Set One, admitted. The defendants filed the motion on December 22, 2023, after plaintiff failed to timely respond to the requests for admission. The judge granted the motion, deeming the matters within the requests for admission admitted and conclusively established against the plaintiff. The plaintiff had promised to serve proposed responses to the requests for admission in the future, but this was insufficient to oppose the motion. The judge noted that the plaintiff's failure to provide a timely response necessitated this motion and that the court will not impose sanctions, as requested by the defendants.
