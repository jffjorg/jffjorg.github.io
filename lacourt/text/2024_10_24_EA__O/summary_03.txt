  - Defendant: Selene Finance LP and U.S. Bank Trust National Association
  - Court: Judge
Significant Statements:
  - "Plaintiff's contention that an SPOC would have allowed for the submission of the proper papers is contradicted by both the FAC and the opposition which state that ALL documents were sent to Defendant."
  - "The purpose of a SPOC is to explore other options to avoid foreclosure, one of those processes is a loan modification, and that application, Plaintiff submitted."
  - "Even if there were statutory violations, they appear immaterial as Plaintiff's (contradictory) complaint state[s] that he submitted a loan modification application after the NOD was recorded (thus he was aware of possible alternatives to foreclosure), that he was informed of missing documents because his representative was in contact/had communications with a Selene representative, and that the Notice of Trustee's Sale that was recorded setting the sale of the Property for August 31, 2023 (RJN Ex. 7) was continued to January 9, 2023 (sic) (Complaint ¶15). Based thereon, [] the complaint does not plead facts to support material violations."

And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by the defendants, Selene Finance LP and U.S. Bank Trust National Association, to the plaintiff's first amended complaint. The plaintiff, Cesar Javier, alleges that the defendants violated various requirements set forth in the Homeowner Bill of Rights statutes by recording a notice of default without first contacting him to discuss his financial situation and/or explore other options aside from foreclosure. The court finds that the plaintiff's complaint fails to plead material violations of the statutes and that the alleged failure to issue a Single Point of Contact (SPOC) and/or notify the plaintiff of foreclosure alternatives is not sufficient to support a claim of wrongful foreclosure. The court grants leave to amend the complaint, but only if the plaintiff can provide a compelling argument supported by factual allegations that the alleged violations were material.
