And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant to respond to Form Interrogatories, Set One. The motion was filed untimely, and the plaintiff failed to include a separate statement with the motion. The judge also declines to impose sanctions on the plaintiff's counsel, finding that they showed good faith by offering multiple extensions to the defendant's counsel. The defendant had sought sanctions in the amount of $4,536.00, but the judge finds that this would be unjust under the circumstances. The case will proceed with the defendant's demurrers to the plaintiff's complaint pending.
