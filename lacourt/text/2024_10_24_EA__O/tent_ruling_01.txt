PLAINTIFF JUAN ALVARRAN’S MOTION TO COMPEL DEFENDANT CITY
OF MONTCLAIR’S RESPONSES TO FORM INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE; REQUEST FOR
SANCTIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,975 AGAINST DEFENDANT’S COUNSEL, BORDIN SEMMER,
LLP PURSUANT TO CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTIONS 2030.300(A) & 2030.300(E)
is DENIED; sanctions are not imposed upon Plaintiffs’ Counsel. 
 
Background
 
This is a negligence case. Plaintiffs JUAN ALVARRAN, an
individual; AMANDA DOW, an individual; and LILAH ALVARRAN, a minor through her
Guardian Ad Litem JUAN ALVARRAN allege the following against Defendants CITY OF
MONTCLAIR, a public entity and ANTHONY ALMEDA: On 1/14/2023, Defendant Almeda
was being pursued by Police Officer Sean Mackey #401 of the Montclair Police
Department when Defendant Almeda collided with Plaintiff’s vehicle and caused a
chain-reaction of collisions with other motor vehicles.
 
On March 13, 2023, Plaintiffs filed suit for: 1.    
NEGLIGENCE (Cal. Gov. Code §§ 815.2(a), 820(a)) 2.    
VICARIOUS LIABILITY OF A PUBLIC ENTITY (Vicarious
Liability of Public Entity (Gov. Code §§ 815.2 and 820; and Veh. Code § 17001)
 
On October 6, 2023, the City of Montclair filed its answer. 
 
On January 22, 2024, the City of Montclair filed a
cross-complaint against the City of Pomona for: 
 
1.    
Implied Indemnity
2.    
Contribution And Indemnity
3.    
Declaratory Relief
 
On February 8, 2024, Plaintiff named the City of Pomona as
Doe 1 and Sean Mackey as Doe 2.
 
On February 21, 2024, City of Pomona filed its answer to the
Cross-Complaint. 
 
On April 11, 2024, the City of Pomona filed a demurrer,
which it withdrew on 4/19/24.
 
On April 19, 2024, the City of Pomona a demurrer, which on
5/20/24 the court sustained with leave to amend mainly because the complaint
did not state what the City of Pomona has allegedly done, notably when the City
of Montclair was engaged in the pursuit. 
 
On May 21, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
a FAC.
 
On July 24, 2024, Plaintiffs filed
a SAC reasserting the same COAs against the same Defendants. 
 
On August 23, 2024, the City of
Montclair (occasionally referred to as, “Montclair”) filed a demurrer to the
SAC.
 
On August 27, 2024, the City of
Pomona (occasionally referred to as, “Pomona”) filed a demurrer to the SAC.
 
On September 11, 2024, the court held an IDC regarding
Plaintiff’s motion to compel discovery. That same day, the instant
motion was filed. 
 
On September 25, 2024, the court heard oral argument on the
demurrers, which it sustained with leave to amend. (Defense Counsel for Pomona
submitted on the tentative; Defense Counsel for Montclair argued that Vehicle
Code sections 20155 and 20156 do not affect Office Mackey’s immunity under
Vehicle Code section 17004.) 
 
On October 11, 2024, Montclair and Mackey filed their
opposition to the discovery motion.
 
To
date, as of Wednesday, 10/23, no Reply has been received (due 5 court days
before hearing, Thurs., 10/17. 
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiffs seek an order be issued compelling Defendant to
respond to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories (FROGs) Set One (1), without
objections. In opposition, Montclair and Mackey advance the following
arguments:
 
-       
Plaintiffs’ motions are untimely
-       
Plaintiffs failed to include the requisite Separate
Statement with any of the motions.
-       
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Deem Admitted is inappropriate
since the City responded to Plaintiffs’ RFAs; Plaintiffs’ request to deem the
RFAs admitted is premature and defective at this juncture. 
 
1.    
Timeliness 
 
Generally, a party has forty-five
(45) days to file a motion to compel further responses, unless the propounding
and responding party have agreed to an extension in writing. (See Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (c) [“Unless notice of
this motion is given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or
any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the
propounding party waives any right to compel a further response to the
interrogatories.”].) The
45-day time limit is mandatory and “jurisdictional” (court has no authority to
grant a late motion). (Sexton v. Sup.Ct. (Mullikin Med. Ctr.) (1997) 58 CA4th 1403, 1410, 68 CR2d 708,
712.) 
 
Plaintiffs explain that the subject discovery was propounded
on Defendants on 2/18/24;
Plaintiffs’ Counsel provided numerous extensions, with a final one on
6/12/24. On June 21, 2024, having received only boilerplate objections to
Plaintiff’s discovery requests, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet and confer
letter to Defendant’s counsel requesting that verified responses be provided no
later than July 8, 2024. (Motion pp. 2-3.) On July 8, 2024, the City requested
a 2-week extension to July 22 to respond to “meet and confer in this matter.”
(Spearman Decl., at ¶ 4, Ex. 2.) 
 
Here, a review of the email correspondence indicates that
Plaintiffs’ Counsel provided an extension to July 29. (Spearman Decl., p. 145
of 195 of PDF [“We need your discovery ASAP. Please submit it. We can grant you
1 extra week from the date that it is currently due.”]; see also p. 145
[Defense Counsel’s paralegal Erin Woodard’s email response sent about 10
minutes later to Plaintiffs’ Counsel Ghaffari’s email [“Thank you. New due date
is July 29th.”].) And then, on 7/22, Defendants sought another 2-week extension
until August 5 to respond to meet and confer efforts. (p. 147 of 195 of PDF.) And
then, on 7/29, Woodard set an email seeking another extension until
August 12. (p. 149 of 195 of PDF.) 
 
Defendant contends that Plaintiffs deadline to file any
motions to compel further responses to Set One of discovery remained on July
31, 2024 because the foregoing emails pertained to Set Two only not Set One (see Opp.
pp. 6-7.) 
 
Here,
the court is not entirely persuaded that the emails unequivocally demonstrate
that FROGs Set Two was the discovery subject to the August 12 deadline. 
 
For one, Montclair’s own opposition appears to conflate
what discovery vehicle is at issue. The opposition is entitled “Omnibus
Opposition To Plaintiffs’ Untimely Motions To Compel Further Responses To Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories And Requests For Production Of
Documents, Set One, And Motion To Deem Admitted Requests For Admission, Set
One, And Request For Sanctions In The Amount Of $4,536.00.” However, the motion
only seeks further responses as to the FROGs, Set One, as is evidenced by the
proposed order. (Though the court notes Footnote 1 of the opposition indicates
that Plaintiffs served four motions upon Defendants; thus, it is unclear
whether this motion was served upon Defendants, or four motions
were served upon Defendants.)[1]
That said, at issue is FROGs, Set One. 
 
Second, a review of the emails attached to Defense
Counsel Spearman’s declaration do not provide that the emails’ subject line is
entitled “FROGs Set Two” or that the emails only discuss FROGs Set Two.

 
To resolve the ambiguity, the court ultimately relies upon
the canon that it is to read every statute with reference to the entire scheme
of law “so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.” (Golf
& Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127,
136 (Golf).) Here, construing the 45-day requirement so that is
consistent with the statutes favoring discoverability (Greyhound Corp. v.
Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 355, 380), the court does not find that
the motion is untimely. 
 
2.    
Separate Statement 
 
Notwithstanding,
the motion fails for the failure to attach a separate statement, per the
California Rules of Court Rule 3.1345. While the court would ordinarily
overlook this defect if a motion provides the exact interrogatories at issue
and why further responses are required, here, the motion does not provide an
analysis. (Opp. p. 11.) For an idea of what is at issue, the court looked at the
meet and confer letter attached to Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration. The
declaration indicates that FROGs 1.1, 3.1 to 3.3, 4.1 and 4.2, 7.1 to 7.3, 12.1
to 12.7, 13.1 and 13.2, 14.1, 15.1, 16.1 to 17.1, and 20.1 to 20.11 are at
issue. (Ghaffari Decl., p. 75 of 86 of PDF. The FROGs seek seemingly basic
information (e.g., Defendant’s insurance coverages (4.1 and 4.2); property
damage, or repairs (7.1 to 7.3); Plaintiff requests information regarding when,
where, and how the incident occurred. But absent a separate statement,
Defendants’ objections are unknown. Therefore, as Plaintiffs did not meet
certain procedural requirements for motions to compel further discovery, the
motion is denied. 
 
3.    
Sanctions
 
Sanctions should not be imposed when “the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300,
subd. (d), emphasis added.)
 
Defendants seek sanctions focusing on the lack of substantial
justification in Plaintiffs filing their motion: “Plaintiffs and/or their
counsel stuck their heads in the sand and ignored the wealth of authority and
extensive analysis provided by the City in support of its position and filed
the subject motions anyway.” (Opp. p. 14:17-19.) Defendants seek $4,536.00 in
sanctions against Plaintiffs and/or Counsel [calculated as follows: 18.9 hours at
$240/hour].[2]
 
Here, though the court notes that the motion does not provide
a SS nor provides an analysis as to why further responses should be compelled
nor do Plaintiffs file a Reply to clarify any of the issues (including concerns
with timeliness), the
court declines to impose because it would be unjust under the circumstances.
Namely, Plaintiffs offered Defendants multiple extensions, which is a showing
of good faith. 
 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is denied, and sanctions
are not imposed upon Plaintiffs’ Counsel.
