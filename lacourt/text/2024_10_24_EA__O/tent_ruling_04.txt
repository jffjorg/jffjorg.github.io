[1] As with before, Plaintiff does not oppose Defendant’s
request for judicial notice (RJN) of various deeds and notices. Thus, the RJN
is granted. 


[2]  And Plaintiff
has not offered authority that all options to avoid foreclosure must be
offered. And even if Plaintiff qualified for the Mortgage Relief Program (FAC
¶21), Plaintiff has not addressed how the failure to offer that as an option is
material. The same issues goes to whether Defendants were required to allow
Plaintiff a status of review of the application or whether Defendants were
required to offer a reason as to denial of the loan.
