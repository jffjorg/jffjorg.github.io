And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Rosario Marcela Rivera Santos v. General Motors LLC, et al. The plaintiff, Ms. Santos, filed a complaint against General Motors alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The plaintiff propounded discovery requests, including Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Admission, but the defendant, General Motors, responded with deficient and boilerplate responses.

The plaintiff sent a meet-and-confer letter to the defendant, but the defendant did not provide further responses. The plaintiff filed motions to compel further responses, and the defendant filed opposition briefs. The court expressed concern that neither party met and conferred in good faith, as the plaintiff's meet-and-confer letter was sent with a one-day deadline for response, and the defendant did not provide further responses despite the plaintiff's repeated efforts.

Instead of ruling on the motions, the court has continued the hearing to a date in November 2024. The parties are ordered to meet and confer about the discovery requests in dispute, and to provide a status report with details of their meet-and-confer efforts, including a description of the remaining interrogatories and requests at issue.
