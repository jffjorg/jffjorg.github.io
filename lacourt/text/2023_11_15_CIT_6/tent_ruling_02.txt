   [1] Kaiser also  separately filed a motion permitting Kaiser to file its opposition under seal,  which is set for hearing on December 11, 2023. Kaiser lodged an unredacted copy  of its motion with the Court, which the Court relies upon in making its  decision herein, and thereby rendering moot the hearing on December 11, 2023.   [2] The Court  notes that the Covid-19 pandemic was clearly an event beyond the control of all  parties involved and was a significant cause of part of the delays here.  Nevertheless, this case had already been pending for two and half years before  the pandemic happened, plus the impact of the pandemic has substantially abated  over the past couple years, such that it does not fully explain all the delays  in the resolution of this action.
