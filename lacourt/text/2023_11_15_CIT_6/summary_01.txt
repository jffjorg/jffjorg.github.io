And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center's motion for prejudgment interest against Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. et al. The court finds that the hospital is entitled to prejudgment interest, with an applicable interest rate of 10% and a date of accrual of December 28, 2022. The dispute arises from the hospital's claims for payment for medical services provided to Kaiser, with the hospital seeking prejudgment interest on the outstanding balance. The court considers various factors, including the length of time the hospital has been waiting for payment, the uncertainty of the damages, and the fact that Kaiser has had the ability to invest or use the money during this time period. The court also rejects Kaiser's arguments that the hospital is not entitled to prejudgment interest and that the interest rate should be 15% as per Health and Safety Code section 1371.35.
