And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses Kaiser's motion to file its opposition under seal, which has been rendered moot by the filing of an unredacted copy of the motion with the court. The judge notes that the Covid-19 pandemic was an unexpected event that caused some delays in the case, but that it does not fully explain all the delays. The case had already been pending for over two years before the pandemic, and the pandemic's impact has since abated. The judge's ruling is intended to guide the court's decision at a future hearing, but the hearing itself has been rendered unnecessary.
