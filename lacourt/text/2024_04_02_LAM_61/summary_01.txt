Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production and interrogatories from the defendants, Extensions Plus, Inc. and Helene Stahl. The defendants have failed to fully comply with the discovery requests, and the court has ordered them to provide additional responses. The court has also awarded sanctions against the defendants in the amount of $6,300.

The court has granted the motion as to requests for production and special interrogatories, but denied it as to form interrogatory No. 15.1. The court has found that the defendants' responses were incomplete, inadequate, or evasive, and that they failed to identify which documents correspond to which request number.

The court has also awarded sanctions against the defendants in the amount of $4,500 and $1,800, respectively, for their failure to comply with discovery requests. The court has denied the defendants' motion to incorporate previously filed papers and has ordered them to provide a further response to the plaintiff's special interrogatories.
