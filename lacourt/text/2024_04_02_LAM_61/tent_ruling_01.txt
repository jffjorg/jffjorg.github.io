I.     
MOTIONS
TO COMPEL FURTHER
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by propounding to any other party to
the action written interrogatories to be answered under oath.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.010(a).) If a
propounding party is not satisfied with the response served by a responding
party, the former may move the court to compel further interrogatory
responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)  The propounding party must demonstrate that
the responses were incomplete, inadequate or evasive, or that the responding
party asserted objections that are either without merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300(a)(1)–(3); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 403.)
“A propounding party may demand a responding
party to produce documents that are in their possession, custody or control.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.010.) A party may likewise conduct discovery by
propounding interrogatories to another party to be answered under oath. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2030.010, subd. (a).) The responding party must respond to the
production demand either by complying, by representing that the party lacks the
ability to comply, or by objecting to the demand. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.210.) The responding party must respond to the interrogatories by
answering or objecting. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.210, subd. (a).) If the
responding party fails to serve timely responses, the propounding party may
move for an order compelling responses to the production demand and
interrogatories. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)
 
Plaintiff Raj Hair International Pvt., Ltd.
(Plaintiff) moves to compel further responses to Requests for Production No.
1–23 from Defendant Helene Stahl (Stahl) and Request No. 1–54 and a large
number of Interrogatories from Defendant Extensions Plus, Inc. (EP).
 
1.     Requests for Production
 
The Requests were served on November 14,
2022, and over the following months were responded to and supplemented, with
the last iteration of responses — the second supplemental responses — sent on
December 1, 2023. (Gonzales Decl. ¶¶ 2–10.) These requests sought documents and
communications between Defendants EP and Stahl related to Plaintiff, shipments
and payments from and to Plaintiff, the sources of funds (e.g. loans from
specified financial institutions) by which Defendants would pay Plaintiff,
Stahl’s ownership interest in EP, and documents related to EP’s relationships
with particular individuals. (Separate Statement.) Defendants initially
responded variously to each request, either stating that EP “has produced a CD
with all documents and communications,” that no responsive documents existed,
or only with objections.[1]
(Separate Statement.) The second supplemental responses, however, consist of
the same response:
 
Helene Stahl will continue to comply with
this demand. All responsive documents in its possession, custody or control
have been produced in a prior CD. Additionally, this response was supplemented
with more documents that have been sent over in a large box.
 
(Separate Statement.) The responses from EP
were essentially similar, with the addition of a reference to prior litigation
between the parties. (Separate Statement.).
 
Plaintiff contends that Defendants’
production is missing large portions of the documents called for, and that Defendants
failed to Bate-number their production. (Stahl Motion at pp. 16–18; EP Motion
at pp. 16–18.)
 
Defendants in opposition argue that the motion’s
notice incorrectly lists the grounds for the motion in the second, rather than
the first paragraph, as required by CRC Rule 3.1110, and further seeks to
incorporate all previously filed papers without specific reference to the date
or title. Stahl also argues that the motion contains no index of exhibits.
(Opposition at pp. 5–6.) Defendants have identified no conceivable prejudice
resulting from these procedural defects, however, and they furnish no basis to
deny the motions.
 
Defendants also contend that they have
substantially complied with the requests by offering statements of compliance,
inability to comply, and objections. (Opposition at pp. 4–6.) They also argue
that because the motion contains no argument concerning their objections, the
court should not rule upon them. (Opposition at pp. 6–7.) 
 
Plaintiff presents no evidence as to whether
any documents have been withheld from it in Defendants’ production. Although the
motions state that various categories of documents have not been produced,
Plaintiff presents no evidence or affidavit concerning the state of the
production upon which the court could determine the veracity of the argument. 
 
However, Defendants’ oppositions strongly
suggest that a further response is required. Although Defendants’ latest
responses consist of identical assurances that all responsive documents have already
been produced in a “prior CD” and “large box,” Defendants in opposition to the
present motion appear to place great stock in the service of prior objections
and statements of inability to comply, to the point where it is unclear whether
Defendants continue to rely upon these earlier responses as implied limitations
upon later statements of compliance.
 
The remedy for this lack of clarity is found
in Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.280, subd. (a), which states: “Any documents
or category of documents produced in response to a demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling shall be identified with the specific request
number to which the documents respond.” Plaintiff contends that the documents
were produced “shoebox” fashion and without Bates numbers, leaving the task of
identifying which documents correspond to which request to Plaintiff. (Motion
at pp. 10–11.) Defendants in opposition do not dispute this characterization,
but argue, mistakenly, that no authority requires further clarity. (Opposition
at p. 7.) Per Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.280, however, Defendants were
required to identify which documents correspond to which request number. Such a
requirement is all the more important when both Defendants have offered a
“joint” production referring to the same batches of documents, even though
served with different requests.  Defendants
must therefore provide a further response in compliance with Code of Civil
Procedure § 2031.280.
 
Nor may Defendants rely on objections to
limit their responses to these requests. Defendants’ initial responses were
served late, and as such the objections were waived. (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.300, subd. (a).) Defendants acknowledge the effect of tardy responses in
opposition. (Opposition at pp. 6–7.) Nor have Defendants identified any
documents being withheld pursuant to objections as required for any such withholding
under Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.240.
 
The motion is therefore GRANTED as to
Requests No. 1–23 and 1–54.
 
2.     Special Interrogatories
 
Plaintiff seeks further responses from EP to
Special Interrogatories,  2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50,
52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90,
92, 94, 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120, 122, 124,
126, 128, 130, 132, 134, 136, 138, 140, 142, 144, 146, 148, 150, 152, 154,
156,  158, 160, 162, 164, 166, 168, and
189. 
 
Plaintiff argues that Special Interrogatories
No. 2 and 6 asked EP whether it contended it performed its obligations under a
May 2018 agreement and to state all facts upon which it based such contention.
EP responded that it denied the May 2018 agreement constituted an agreement,
but in any event that it “was obligated not to pay [under any agreement]
because Plaintiffs sent hair that was never asked for, sent hair that was
defective and was told repeatedly by Plaintiff that Defendant did not have to
pay.” (Separate Statement at pp. 3–7.) Plaintiff argues that this response is
framed entirely in general terms and does not provide the facts sought. (Ibid.)
EP in opposition does not contend that its factual responses are sufficient,
but rather that no factual response was required because it denies the
existence of an agreement. (Separate Statement at p. 4.) But this argument is
unpersuasive, as EP may not contend in the alternative that it complied with
the agreement, and fail to offer all facts called for supporting this
alternative basis. A further response is therefore required. 
 
Plaintiff argues that Special Interrogatory
No. 189 requires a further response. This interrogatory  seeks the “dollar amount of your working
capital” for EP for each month or quarter from January 2017 to the present.
(Separate Statement at p. 81.) EP responded with objections based on the amount
of interrogatories and also trade secret protections. (Separate Statement at
pp. 81–82.) EP in opposition does not support the trade secret objection, and
has not moved for a protective order as to the amount of special
interrogatories. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 2030.040.) Moreover, EP’s
objections have been waived by untimely service of responses. Interrogatory No.
189 therefore requires a further response.
 
Further responses are also required for the
remaining interrogatories. Asked for facts supporting its contention that it
complied with various given invoices, EP responded only with the terse
statement that “Payment was sent to Plaintiff,” or “The hair that was sent was
defective,” without further elaboration. Moreover, when asked to identify
documents supporting any of the given contentions, EP only stated that it “has
already provided emails, text messages and hundreds of other documents in its
response to request for production to support its contention.” (See Separate
Statement.) This response framed in the most general terms is not useful for
identifying which document in EP’s production supports which contention. 
Thus the motion is GRANTED as to all special
interrogatories.
 
3.     Form Interrogatory No. 15.1
 
Interrogatory No. 15.1 asks EP to state all
facts and evidence supporting its denials and affirmative defenses. EP has
provided factual narratives supporting its defenses, but Plaintiff seeks
elaboration on particular factual averments made in these narratives:
 
·     EP claims that Plaintiff “at one point”
acknowledged that EP had been overpaying for defective hair and that EP “would
be credited the monies they overpaid,” but Plaintiff argues that EP does not
state when this acknowledgement happened, the amount of overpayment, or which
of Plaintiff’s representatives made this representation (Motion at p. 14);
·     EP claims that Plaintiff “told Defendants to
not worry about paying and that they would continue to send hair even though
Defendants did not place any orders,” and Plaintiff argues that the response
does not include when the representation was made or who made it (Motion at pp.
14–15);
·     EP asserts affirmative defenses based on a
prior litigation between the parties, but while they have identified the case
name and their prior attorney, they state that they do not know the case number
and will provide it when it is found. (Separate Statement.) Plaintiff argues
that EP has not yet provided the case number and should be compelled to do so. (Motion
at p. 15.)
 
No further response is necessary as to Form
Interrogatory No. 15.1 This is a multi-part interrogatory seeking all facts,
documents, and witnesses supporting each of EP’s affirmative defense, of which
EP has asserted 45 in its answer. That portion of Plaintiff’s separate
statement devoted to EP’s initial and supplemental responses to Form
Interrogatory No. 15.1 extends to 90 pages. EP’s responses provide substantial
factual narratives supporting their affirmative defenses. If these responses leave
lingering questions concerning the time and manner of particular
representations common to multiple affirmative defenses, the matter may be more
economically addressed by further interrogatories directed to those particular
remaining questions. Rather than require another lengthy iteration of responses
to this particular interrogatory, the parties’ resources would be better
directed toward interrogatories seeking the precise factual matter that
Plaintiff seeks — e.g. who made a particular representation, and at what time
did this representation occur. 
 
The motion is therefore GRANTED as to
Plaintiff’s special interrogatories, and DENIED as to Form Interrogatory No.
15.1.
 
II.   SANCTIONS
Statute provides that the court shall impose sanctions upon
a party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response
to interrogatories, requests for production of documents, or requests for
admission, absent substantial justification otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.300, subd. (d); 2031.310, subd. (h); 2033.290, subd. (d).)
Plaintiff seeks $20,090 in
sanctions in connection with its motion against EP, representing 44.6 hours of
attorney work at $450 per hour. (Gonzales Decl. ¶ 13.) Plaintiff also
seeks $5,400.00 in connection with the motion against Stahl, representing 12
hours of attorney work at the same rate. (Gonzales Decl. ¶ 13.)
Sanctions are awarded against
EP in the mount of $4,500 and Stahl in the amount of $1,800.
