And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a petition filed by J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC (Petitioner) seeking approval of the transfer of structured settlement payment rights from Darryl Savala (Payee) to the Petitioner. The Payee has dependents, a 17-year-old minor child and an 8-year-old minor child, and is experiencing financial hardship. The Petitioner has provided notice to interested parties and filed proof of service.

The court has reviewed the petition and finds that it is in the Payee's best interest to transfer the structured settlement payment rights to the Petitioner. The Payee has been advised in writing by the Petitioner to seek independent professional advice regarding the transfer and has either received that advice or knowingly waived, in writing, the opportunity to receive this advice.

The court also finds that the Petitioner complied with the notice requirements in Insurance Code § 10139.5(f)(2) and that the disclosure complies with Insurance Code § 10136. The transfer agreement complies with Insurance Code § 10138.

Based on these findings, the court grants the Petitioner's petition approving the transfer of structured settlement payment rights. The court retains jurisdiction to interpret and monitor the implementation and closing of the transaction as justice requires. The Petitioner is ordered to provide notice of this order and file proof of service.
