FOR ADMISSION – SET TWO AGAINST DEFENDANT CRISTINA MERCADO BE DEEMED ADMITTED and
MONETARY SANCTIONSI.          INTRODUCTION
On July 14, 2021, Plaintiff MIP,
LLC (“Plaintiff” or “MIP”) filed an action against Defendants Monitor Polishing
& Plating, Inc. (“MPP”), Miguel Mercado (“Miguel”), Cristina Mercado
(“Cristina”), and Does 1 to 20 for (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of
guaranty, (3) open book account, (4) account stated, (5) trespass, and (6)
nuisance. Plaintiff alleges that around September 2005, it entered into a
written commercial lease agreement with Defendant MPP for property located at
8050 San Fernando Road, Sun Valley, CA 91352, with Defendants Miguel and
Cristina Mercado as guarantors. Plaintiff alleges that MPP defaulted on rental
payments due on June 08, 2020, and utilized hazardous substances on the
premises in violation of the Lease; and that both Miguel and Cristina have also
refused to pay the sum owed.
On November 18, 2024, Plaintiff
filed the instant motion to deem Requests for Admissions (RFAs) - Set Two
admitted against Defendant Cristina. No opposition to the motion has been
filed.    
            II.        REQUESTS
FOR ADMISSIONS 
“Any party may obtain discovery . . . by a written request that any other
party to the action admit the genuineness of specified documents, or the truth
of specified matters of fact, opinion relating to fact, or application of law
to fact. A request for admission may relate to a matter that is in controversy
between the parties.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.010.)¿ “Within 30 days after
service of requests for admission, the party to whom the requests are directed
shall serve the original of the response to them on the requesting party, and a
copy of the response on all other parties who have appeared . . ..”¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250(a).)  
If a party to whom request for admissions are served fails to provide a
timely response, the party to whom the request was directed waives any
objections, including based on privilege or the work product doctrine. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(a).) The requesting party can move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
request be deemed admitted, as well as for monetary sanctions. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280(b).) The court shall issue this order unless the party to
whom the request was made serves a response in substantial compliance prior to
the hearing on the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).) 
Here, Plaintiff served RFAs Set Two on Defendant Cristina Mercado on
October 14, 2024, making Defendant’s responses due by November 15, 2024.
(Meyers Decl., ¶ 2, Exh. A.) Defendant failed to provide timely responses,
which necessitated Plaintiff filing this motion. As of the hearing date,
Cristina has not served any responses to the RFAs, nor has Cristina opposed
this motion. Accordingly, under CCP section 2033.280(c), the Court must deem
the RFAs admitted.
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request to deem RFAs Set Two admitted.
Sanctions
Sanctions are mandatory against the party, the attorney, or both whose
failure to serve a timely response to the request necessitated the motion to
deem request for admissions as admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c); see
also Cal. Rules of Court R. 3.1348(a) [the court can award sanctions under
the Discovery Act in favor of a party seeking to compel discovery even though
no opposition was filed, the opposition was withdrawn, or the requested
discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed].) 
Here, Cristina’s failure to timely serve responses to RFAs by the
November 15, 2024, deadline necessitated this motion. Plaintiff’s counsel
declares that they expended one hour preparing the motion and incurred a filing
fee of $60.00, for a total requested sanction of $450.00. (Meyers Decl., ¶¶
4-5.)
Counsel’s hourly rate is $450, which the Court finds reasonable. However,
the Court reduces the time spent on a motion of this nature to 0.5 hours at the
$450 hourly rate, plus the $60 filing fee. Given that the motion is unopposed,
the Court adjusts the sanctions accordingly.
The Court imposes monetary sanctions in the amount of $285.00 against
Defendant Cristina Mercado, payable to Plaintiff’s counsel within 30 days of
this order.
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for sanctions in part
awarding $285.00.
IV.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER
            The Court
GRANTS Plaintiff’s request to deem the RFAs Set Two admitted, and awards
Plaintiff $285.00 in monetary sanctions to be paid within 20 days of this
order.
            Plaintiff
is to give notice.Dated: December 27, 2024 JARED D. MOSES JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT
