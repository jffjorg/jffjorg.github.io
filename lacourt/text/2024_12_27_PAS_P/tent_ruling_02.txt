 Case Number:  24AHCV00073    Hearing Date:   December 27, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER SUSTAINING DEFENDANT ROSEMEAD DEMURRER
TO THE COMPLAINT WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND and ORDER RENDERING DEFENDANT STIMPERT
& FORD LLP ANTI-SLAPP MOTION AS MOOTI.          INTRODUCTION
On January 16, 2024, Plaintiff Jose
Edwardo Ornelas Gonzalez (“Plaintiff”) filed an action against Defendants
Rosemead Boulevard Properties, LLC (“Rosemead” or “Defendant”) and Stimpert
& Ford, LLP (“Stimpert”), alleging damages for violation of the California
Identity Theft Act (Civ. Code, § 1798.92 et seq.).
On May 2, 2024, Defendant Stimpert
filed a special motion to strike pursuant to California’s anti-SLAPP statute
(Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16). On May 14, 2024, Defendant Rosemead filed a
demurrer, arguing that Plaintiff’s claims are barred under Code of Civil
Procedure section 426.30, the compulsory cross-complaint rule. On August 2,
2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the demurrer, and on December 19, 2024,
Defendant Rosemead filed a reply.
The Court now considers both
Defendant Rosemead’s demurrer and Defendant Stimpert’s anti-SLAPP motion.
Meet and Confer
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41, subdivision (a), the demurring party is required to meet and
confer with the party who filed the pleading at least five days before the
responsive pleading is due. This must occur in person, telephone or by video
conference with the aim of resolving any objections raised in the demurrer.
Additionally, the demurring party must file and serve a declaration detailing
the meet and confer efforts. It should be noted, however, that the failure to
meet and confer is not itself grounds for sustaining or overruling a demurrer
or granting or denying a motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, subd.
(a)(4), 435.5, subd. (a)(4).)
Here, on April 23, 2024,
Defendant’s counsel met and conferred with Plaintiff’s counsel regarding the
demurrer. Despite their efforts, the parties were unable to resolve the issues.
(Traver Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.) Accordingly, the Court finds that the meet-and-confer
requirement has been satisfied.
Judicial Notice
Defendant requests judicial notice
of the following documents filed with the Los Angeles Superior Court in Rosemead
Boulevard Properties, LLC v. Jose Edwardo Ornelas Gonzales (Case No.
23STCV01945):

Exhibit
     A: The Complaint filed on January 30, 2023.
Exhibit
     B: The Answer filed on March 10, 2023.
Exhibit
     C: The Request for Dismissal filed on November 13, 2023.
Exhibit
     D: The Register of Actions.

Judicial notice of court records is
proper under Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (d). As such, the Court
GRANTS Defendant’s request for judicial notice for Exhibits A, B, C and D. 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of a complaint. Donabedian v.
Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994. A plaintiff’s allegations
must be accepted as true for purposes of demurrer, no matter how “improbable”
they are. (Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 (Del E. Webb).) Allegations need not be
accepted as true if they are contradicted by judicially noticeable facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224
Cal.App.4th 1462, 1474.) 
Pleadings are to be broadly
construed (Code Civ. Proc., § 452) and demurrers are to be overruled where the
facts are sufficient to state any cause of action. (Quelimane Co. v. Stewart
Title Guaranty Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38.)
When a defendant has failed to
allege a related cause of action in a cross-complaint in a prior action, the
bar of the compulsory cross-complaint rule can be raised by demurrer in the
subsequent action. See, e.g., AL Holding Co. v. O'Brien & Hicks,
Inc. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 1310 (Pursuant to CCP § 426.30, defendant had
demurred on the ground that the cause of action was barred because the
plaintiff never raised it in a compulsory cross-complaint in a prior action
instituted by defendant.). 
III.      ANALYSIS
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s
claims are barred under Code of Civil Procedure section 426.30 because
Plaintiff failed to file a compulsory cross-complaint in the underlying action,
Rosemead Boulevard Properties, LLC v. Jose Eduardo Ornelas Gonzales
(Case No. 23STCV01945). Specifically, Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s
identity theft claims are inextricably linked to the original collection
lawsuit, which sought to recover unpaid rent arising from the same lease
transaction that Plaintiff now disputes. Defendant further asserts that under
the compulsory cross-complaint rule, Plaintiff was required to assert any
related claims in the prior action to avoid piecemeal litigation. (Demurrer,
pp. 4–6.)
Defendant also argues that
Plaintiff cannot maintain an action under Civil Code section 1798.93 because
Defendant is not a “claimant” as defined by section 1798.92, subdivision (a).
Defendant asserts that it dismissed the underlying collection lawsuit without
prejudice on November 13, 2023, before Plaintiff filed the instant action.
Accordingly, Defendant argues that it no longer has a present claim for money
or property and thus does not qualify as a "claimant." (Demurrer, pp.
6-7)
In opposition, Plaintiff contends
that his claims are not barred by the compulsory cross-complaint rule because
the California Identity Theft Act ("CITA") requires written notice of
identity theft under Civil Code section 1798.93, subdivision (c), and allows
the claimant 30 days to investigate before a victim of identity theft can file
an action. Plaintiff argues that his statutory notice, served on May 17, 2023,
was sent after he filed his Answer in the prior action and that his claims did
not accrue until Defendant failed to conduct the required investigation.
Plaintiff further asserts that section 1798.93, subdivision (a), uses the
permissive term “may” when referring to filing a cross-complaint, which
Plaintiff interprets as optional rather than mandatory. (Opposition, pp. 4–7.)
Plaintiff also disputes Defendant’s
contention that it is not a “claimant” under CITA. Plaintiff argues that
Defendant’s dismissal of the underlying lawsuit without prejudice does not
extinguish its status as a claimant, as Defendant retains the right to refile
the dismissed lawsuit (Opposition, p.7)
In reply, Defendant contends that
Plaintiff misinterprets the timing requirements under CITA. Defendant asserts
that the 30-day waiting period in Civil Code section 1798.93, subdivisions
(c)(5) and (6), applies only to claims for damages and not to cross-complaints
asserting identity theft. Defendant further argues that Plaintiff’s statutory
notice timing does not relieve Plaintiff of the obligation to file a
cross-complaint for claims arising from the same transaction or occurrence as
the original collection lawsuit. Defendant cites Flickinger v. Swedlow
Engineering Co. (1955) 45 Cal.2d 388, 393, to emphasize the prohibition
against piecemeal litigation. (Reply, pp. 3–5.)
The central issue in this demurrer
is whether Plaintiff’s claims under Civil Code section 1798.93 are barred by
Code of Civil Procedure section 426.30, which mandates that a party assert any
related cause of action in a cross-complaint in the original action or be
precluded from bringing it in a subsequent lawsuit.
Under CCP section 426.30, a
“related cause of action” is defined in CCP section 426.10, subdivision (c), as
one that arises from the same transaction, occurrence, or series of
transactions or occurrences as the plaintiff’s claims. Courts interpret “transaction”
broadly to encourage the resolution of all interrelated claims in a single
action to avoid piecemeal litigation and conflicting judgments. (Ranchers
Bank v. Pressman (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 612, 620; Manning v. Wymer
(1969) 273 Cal.App.2d 519, 525.)
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s
identity theft claims arise directly from the lease transaction and allegations
of unpaid rent at the heart of Defendant’s prior collection lawsuit. Defendant
further asserts that Plaintiff’s failure to file a cross-complaint in the
original action precludes him from asserting these claims now, citing the
compulsory cross-complaint rule under CCP section 426.30. Defendant also
contends that Plaintiff’s argument about the permissive language in Civil Code
section 1798.93 is misplaced, as the timing of Plaintiff’s statutory notice
does not exempt him from the requirement to assert related claims in the
original action.
Plaintiff, who represented himself
pro per in the prior action, argues that Civil Code section 1798.93 permits,
but does not require, filing a cross-complaint. Plaintiff asserts that his
claims under the California Identity Theft Act accrued only after Defendant
failed to investigate his statutory notice, which was sent after he filed his
Answer. 
The Court acknowledges the
challenges faced by litigants representing themselves. However, the rules
governing compulsory cross-complaints apply equally to all parties, including
those acting in pro per. The purpose of CCP section 426.30 is to ensure
that all claims arising from the same transaction are resolved within a single
action, thereby promoting judicial efficiency, and avoiding duplicative
lawsuits.
In this case, Plaintiff’s identity
theft claims under Civil Code section 1798.93 are logically interrelated with
Defendant’s prior collection lawsuit. The facts giving rise to Plaintiff’s
claims were known at the time of the original action, even if Plaintiff was
unaware of his obligation to file a cross-complaint. Accordingly, the Court
finds that Plaintiff was required to assert these claims as a cross-complaint
in the prior action. Filing them in a separate action is procedurally improper.
Based on the foregoing, the Court
SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer without leave to amend.
Motion to Strike – Anti-SLAPP
California’s anti-SLAPP statute
states: “A cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person
in furtherance of the person's right of petition or free speech under the
United States Constitution or the California Constitution in connection with a
public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike, unless the court
determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that
the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd.
(b)(1), italics added.) The purpose of the statute is to “protect defendants
from meritless lawsuits that might chill the exercise of their rights to speak
and petition on matters of public concern.” (Wilson v. Cable News Network,
Inc. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 871, 883–884.)
This special motion to strike is
made on the pleadings and affidavits. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd.
(b)(2).) If the moving party prevails, he or she is entitled to recover
attorney’s fees and costs. (Id., § 425.16, subd. (c)(1).) But if the plaintiff
prevails on the motion, the court shall award the plaintiff’s reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs (subject to certain exceptions not relevant here). (Ibid.)
In light of the Court’s ruling
sustaining Defendant Rosemead’s demurrer without leave to amend, the anti-SLAPP
motion filed by Defendant Stimpert & Ford, LLP is rendered MOOT.
IV.       ORDER
The Court SUSTAINS the demurrer as
to the Complaint in its entirety, without leave to amend.
Defendant Stimpert & Ford, LLP's anti-SLAPP motion is rendered MOOT.
Defendant Rosemead is to file a
proposed judgment consistent with this ruling within 30 days.  
Defendant Rosemead to give notice.
