And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jianing Liu v. Luke Judge et al. The case involves an unlawful detainer action, and the plaintiff has filed a motion to compel response to form interrogatories and produce documents. The plaintiff propounded requests for admissions, requests for form interrogatories, and requests for production of documents on July 12, 2024, and responses were due July 22, 2024. However, the defendant failed to provide responses, and an extension was granted until July 23, 2024. Despite this, the defendant still failed to provide responses, and the plaintiff sent a "meet-and-confer" letter to the defendant on August 1, 2024. As of the filing of the motion on August 19, 2024, the plaintiff had still not received responses.

The judge grants the motion because the defendant failed to provide timely responses to the form interrogatories and the request for documents. The judge also awards sanctions against the defendant, ordering the defendant to pay $1,870 to the plaintiff's counsel within 30 days. The judge awards attorney's fees for 5 hours of work and reduces the reasonable time to one hour to attend the hearing on the motions.
