And here is the English text to summarize the Judge's tentative ruling:

"This tentative ruling denies the motions filed by Defense Counsel, Arash Sadat and Camron Dowlatshahi, to be relieved as counsel for Defendants Kreation Juicery, Inc. and Marjan Sarshar. The Court finds that the motions are deficient because Defense Counsel did not provide sufficient cause for withdrawal and did not demonstrate a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The Court also notes that the requisite forms were not served on all parties, including Defendants American Commercial Equities Three, LLC and Kreation Weho, LLC. The motions are denied without prejudice, and the parties are ordered to give notice."
