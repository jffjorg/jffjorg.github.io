And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's motion to quash service of the summons and complaint is GRANTED. The defendant, Lily Valentine, argues that the service was improper because it was made at a commercial mail receiving agency (CMRA) without determining whether it was the only address reasonably known for her. The plaintiff, John Juranek, argues that the service was proper. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not met the burden of proof to show that the service was proper. Specifically, the judge notes that the plaintiff did not attempt to determine whether the CMRA address was the only address reasonably known for the defendant, and that the plaintiff's counsel's declaration only attests to looking for the defendant's information on the Secretary of State's website, but does not mention any attempts to find the defendant's address. The judge also notes that the plaintiff did not offer any evidence of "reasonable diligence" in attempting to serve the defendant personally. Therefore, the judge grants the defendant's motion to quash service of the summons and complaint.
