  Case Number:  22STCP03828    Hearing Date:   June 26, 2024    Dept:  82 Donray Jones, Jr.
v. Steve Gordon
Case No.
22STCP03828
[Tentative] Order Denying
Motion for Attorneys’ Fees
 
            Petitioner
Donray Jones, Jr. (“Petitioner”) filed a petition for writ of mandate against
Steve Gordon, Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles (the “DMV”), in his
official capacity (“Respondent”). 
Petitioner alleged that the hearing to suspend his driver’s license did
not comply with California DUI Lawyers Assn. v. Department of Motor Vehicles
(2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 517 (hereinafter, “CDLA”).  The court (Beckloff, J.) granted the petition
on July 31, 2023, and remanded the matter to the DMV.  On March 12, 2024, Petitioner filed a motion
for attorneys’ fees under Government Code section 800.  Respondent opposes the motion on several
grounds, including the timeliness of the motion.  
 
            The court
denies the motion as untimely.  Under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1702, a motion for attorneys’ fees must be
filed under the time period afforded by rules 8.104 and 8.108.  Under rule 8.104, the motion must be filed on
or before the earliest of: (A) 60 days after the clerk serves the “Notice of
Entry” of judgment; (B) 60 days after the appealing party serves the “Notice of
Entry” of judgment; or (C) 180 days after entry of judgment.  This motion was filed 225 days after Judge
Beckloff signed the “order granting petition for writ of mandate.”  
 
            Petitioner’s
counsel argues that no judgment was entered and therefore the deadline has not
yet started running.  As an initial
matter, Petitioner’s counsel is responsible for the lack of a formal
judgment.  On July 31, 2024, in a
separate minute order, Judge Beckloff ordered Petitioner’s counsel as follows:
 
Counsel for Petitioner is to
prepare a proposed judgment, serve on the opposing parties for approval as to
form, wait ten days after service for any objections, meet and confer if there
are objections, and then lodge (do not file) the proposed judgment directly in
Department 86 and file (do not lodge) a declaration stating the existence or
non-existence of any unresolved objections (LASC Local Rule 3.231(n).)  
 
(See Court’s Minute Order, dated July 31, 2023.)  Petitioner’s counsel failed to do so.  Petitioner’s counsel cannot now take
advantage of his own dilatory conduct by arguing that the deadline to file a
motion for attorneys’ fees never started running.  “No one can take advantage of his own
wrong.”  (Civ. Code § 3517.)    
 
            Regardless,
Judge Beckloff’s signed order of July 31, 2023, operated as a “final appealable
order” for purposes of rule 8.104.  This order
completely adjudicated the underlying petition; the order was signed by Judge
Beckloff; the order was file-stamped by the clerk’s office’ and the order was accompanied
by a certificate of mailing to the parties. 
This was sufficient in the absence of “a further signed order to
finalize the adjudication.”  (Russell
v. Foglio (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 653, 660.) 
Therefore, the deadline under rule 8.104 started running on July 31,
2023, which means that Petitioner’s motion for attorneys’ fees is untimely.
 
            Based upon
the foregoing, the court order as follows:
 
            1.         Plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’ fees
is denied.
 
            2.         Plaintiff’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of service with the court.
