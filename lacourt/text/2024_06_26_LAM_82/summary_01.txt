And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Petitioner's motion for attorneys' fees as untimely. Petitioner filed the motion on March 12, 2024, 225 days after Judge Beckloff signed the order granting the petition for writ of mandate. The court found that the deadline to file the motion for attorneys' fees was triggered by the order granting the petition, which was a "final appealable order" under California Rules of Court, rule 8.104. Petitioner's counsel failed to provide a proposed judgment for approval as required by the court's minute order, and therefore, the deadline to file the motion for attorneys' fees started running on July 31, 2023. The court also noted that "no one can take advantage of his own wrong" and that Petitioner's counsel cannot argue that the deadline never started running due to their own dilatory conduct.
