Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by defendants Armin Monfared, Innovative Realty, Inc., and Stephen Couig to the plaintiff's complaint is overruled. The plaintiff, Robert Drummond, brought the action alleging claims of specific performance, breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud-deception, and unfair business practices under Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq.

The defendants argued that the complaint failed to identify the specific statutory scheme from which the UCL claim arises, making the claim defective and meriting a court order sustaining a demurrer. However, the judge found that this argument is legally unsustainable in light of subsequent Supreme Court decisions that disapproved the "statutory scheme" reasoning.

The judge held that claims for unfair business practices do not need to be pleaded specifically and that the plaintiff's complaint sufficiently alleged a cause of action under the UCL. The judge therefore overruled the demurrer and allowed the action to proceed.
