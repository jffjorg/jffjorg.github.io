Defendants Armin

  Complaint.



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Robert Drummond, as
trustee of the Drummond Family Trust of 1991 sues Defendants Armin Monfared, Innovate
Realty, Inc. (sued as Innovative Realty, Inc.; hereafter, Innovative), Bye Bye
House, Inc. (Bye Bye), Stephen Couig, Paul Hanson, Michael Marshall and Does 1
to 50 pursuant to an October 10, 2023 Complaint alleging claims of (1) Specific
Performance, (2) Breach of Contract, (3) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good
Faith and Fair Dealing, (4) Fraud - Deception, (5) Business and Professions
Code sec. 17200, et seq., and (6) Negligence.
The claims arise from the following
allegations. On September 29, 2023, Defendant Paul Hanson and Plaintiff Robert
Drummond entered a written contract for the purchase/sale of real property commonly
known as 11911 Wagner Street, Los Angeles, California 90230 (the Property). Escrow
was opened, Hanson, the buyer, was to deliver the earnest money deposit to
Escrow by October 6, 2023, and to wire funds to close escrow by October 9,
2023. These funds were not received by the specified dates. Thus, on October 9,
2023, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed a notice of breach letter to Defendant Hanson
and others. None of the recipients responded to the notice of breach letter by
the time this action was initiated on October 10, 2023. Neither has Paul Hanson
delivered funds to escrow nor closed the escrow. Instead, Defendants
misrepresented to Plaintiff Drummond that Defendants would purchase the
Property at the escrow price when Defendants knew that they would not purchase
the property at the escrow price if they were not able to sell the Property
during escrow. When Defendants discovered they would not be able to sell the
Property at an adequate profit, Defendants submitted a cancellation of escrow.
B. Motion Before the Court
On November 16, 2023, Defendants
Monfared, Innovate, and Couig filed a demurrer challenging the Complaint’s
fifth cause of action for unfair business practices. The demurrer was set for
hearing on March 18, 2024, and served on Plaintiff Drummond’s counsel via email
and certified mail on November 16, 2023. The email and mailing addresses that
appear for Plaintiff’s counsel in the demurrer’s proof of service are identical
to the email and mailing addresses that appear for Plaintiff’s counsel in the
caption page of Plaintiff Drummond’s Complaint.
Plaintiff Drummond failed to oppose
Defendants Monfared, Innovate, and Couig’s demurrer, which these Defendants
noticed to the Court by filing a notice of non-opposition on March 8, 2024.
Defendants Monfared, Innovate, and
Couig’s demurrer is now before the Court.
 
II. Demurrer
A. Legal Standard
1. Sufficiency
A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) This
device can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) To sufficiently
allege a cause of action, a complaint must allege all the ultimate facts—that
is, the facts needed to establish each element of the cause of action pleaded.
(Committee on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983)
35 Cal.3d 197, 212, superseded by statute as stated in Branick v. Downey
Savings & Loan Assn. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 235, 242.) Thus, “[t]o survive a
[general] demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) In testing the sufficiency of the
cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly
pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962,
966-67.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally
and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other grounds, Jones v.
Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) The face
of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the complaint. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) If facts appearing in the exhibits
contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits take precedence. (Holland
v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded
by statute on other grounds as stated in White v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178
Cal.App.4th 506, 521.)
B. Discussion
1. Demurrer,
Complaint, Fifth Cause of Action, Business and Professions Code sec. 17200, et
seq.: OVERRULED.
a. Local
Standard
Business and Professions Code
section 17200 et seq. (the UCL) prohibits “unfair competition,” which is
defined as, “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and
unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising and any act prohibited by”
the False Advertising Act. (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200.)
Despite use of the term “competition,”
the Unfair Competition Law is not confined to anticompetitive business
practices; it is also directed toward the public’s right to protection from
fraud, deceit, and unlawful conduct. (Hewlett v. Squaw Valley Ski Corp.
(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 499, 519, superseded by statute on other grounds as
stated in United Farm Workers of America v. Dutra Farms (2000) 83
Cal.App.4th 1146, 1163-1164.)
An “unlawful” business act is an
act that violates some other law or regulation. (Klein v. Chevron U.S.A.,
Inc. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1342, 1383.) Thus, the “unlawful” prong of the
UCL borrows violations of other laws and makes those unlawful practices
actionable under the UCL. (Ibid.) Virtually any law or
regulation—federal or state, statutory or common law—can serve as the predicate
for an “unlawful” business act claim under the UCL. (Ibid.) An “unlawful”
business act can include inserting a provision in a contract that a party is
prohibited from enforcing. (See People v. McKale (1979) 25 Cal.3d 626,
635 [acknowledging potential claim for “unlawful” business practice where
mobile home park required tenants to sign rules that the park was prohibited by
law from enforcing].)
As for the “unfair” prong of the
UCL, there is a split of authority as to the test for determining whether a
business act is “unfair.” (See Jolley v. Chase Home Finance, LLC (2013)
213 Cal.App.4th 872, 907 [describing split of authority], disagreed with on
other grounds in Lueras v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP (2013) 221
Cal.App.4th 49, 67.) Some cases hold that a practice is “unfair” if it “offends
established public policy, that is immoral, unethical, oppressive,
unscrupulous, or substantially injurious to consumers, or that has an impact on
the victim that outweighs defendant’s reasons, justifications, and motives for
the practice.” (Ibid.) Other cases require the public policy that is the
predicate to the claim to be tethered to specific constitutional, statutory, or
regulatory provisions. (Ibid.)
The “fraudulent” prong of the UCL
prohibits conduct that is likely to deceive members of the public. (Prata v.
Superior Court (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1144.) Thus, the UCL prohibits,
not only advertising that is false, but also advertising that, while true, is
actually misleading or has a capacity, likelihood, or tendency to deceive or
confuse the public. (Chapman v. Skype Inc. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 217,
226.) The test is objective and based on a reasonable consumer who is neither
the most vigilant nor suspicious of advertising claims nor the most unwary and
unsophisticated, but instead is the ordinary consumer within the target
population. (Ibid.)
b. Analysis
In their demurrer, Defendants
Monfared, Innovate, and Couig argue in relevant part: “Here, Plaintiff fails to
identify the particular ‘statutory scheme’ that Demurring Parties allegedly
violated. The Complaint states only in general conclusory language that ‘Plaintiff
brings this action under Business and Professions Code sect 17200, et seq. and
section 17500 as individuals who have suffered injury in fact and have lost
money as a result of Defendants’ acts and omissions.’ [Complaint, ¶ 55.] This
is simply insufficient.” (Demurrer, p. 4.)
No opposition appears in the
record.
After review, the Court finds in
favor of Plaintiff Drummond.
The argument raised by the demurrer
is that the Complaint, like the one in Khoury v. Maly’s of Cal. (1993)
14 Cal.App.4th 612, 619 (Khoury) fails to identify the specific
statutory scheme from which the UCL claim arises, making the claim defective,
and meriting a court order sustaining a demurrer.
However, in Quelimane Co.
v. Stewart Title Guar. Co. (1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 46 (Quelimane) the
California Supreme Court impliedly rejected the “statutory scheme” reasoning of
the Khoury court by holding that claims for unfair business practices
need not be pleaded specifically. (Quelimane, supra, 19 Cal.4th
at p. 46.) Then, in Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular
Telephone Co. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 182-183 the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff
need not show that there is a specific statute prohibiting the conduct,
concluding “the Legislature’s mere failure to prohibit an activity does not
prevent a court from finding it unfair.” (Id. at p. 184.)
As a result, the sole argument
advanced by Defendants Monfared, Innovate, and Couig is legally unsustainable
in light of the two subsequent Supreme Court decisions that disapprove the
reasoning in Khoury. 
III. Conclusion
Defendants Armin Monfared, Innovate Realty, Inc., and Stephen Couig’s
Demurrer to the Complaint is OVERRULED.
