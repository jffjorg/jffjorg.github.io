And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to continue the trial date filed by Plaintiff Jose Gallardo. The trial date is now set for June 4, 2024, at 8:30 AM in Department 26 of the Spring Street Courthouse. The motion was granted because a new defendant, San Gabriel Transit, Inc., was added to the action on October 3, 2023, and additional discovery is required. The defendants have stipulated to the trial continuance, and there is no prejudice to the other parties. The judge finds that the factors of Rule 3.1332 weigh in favor of the requested continuance of the trial date.
