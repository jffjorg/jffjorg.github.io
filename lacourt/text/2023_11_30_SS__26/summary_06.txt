And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by defendants Treehouse Botanicals Corporation, Ariel Mehrban, and Jillian Goldsmith. The demurrer was filed in response to the complaint filed by plaintiff Urban Therapies Distribution, LLC, which alleges breach of contract and open book account.

The court has sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action for breach of contract, finding that the complaint does not adequately allege the existence of a writing signed by each defendant, as required by Commercial Code section 2201, subdivision (1). The court has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint.

The court has overruled the demurrer to the second cause of action for open book account, finding that the invoices submitted by the plaintiff are sufficient to support this claim.

The court has also ruled that the defendants' argument regarding improper service is without merit, and that the defendants must separately reserve and pay the requisite fees for each of the motions to quash service.

The court's tentative ruling is subject to change following the hearing on November 30, 2023.
