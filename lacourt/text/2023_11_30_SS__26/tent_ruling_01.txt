ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Shan Mao (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action against Defendant Hassan Mohamed Adan (“Defendant”) on
April 1, 2022. Defendant filed an answer on June 17, 2022. 
 
Defendant filed
the instant Motion for Summary Judgment on September 11, 2023. No opposition
has been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
The Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) motor vehicle
negligence; and (2) general negligence. The action arises out of a motor
vehicle accident that occurred on April 4, 2019. (Compl., ¶MV-1.) Defendant
allegedly “negligently operated his vehicle so as to crash into plaintiffs
storefront, causing major and catastrophic damage to the business premises. As
a result of the damage, plaintiff was
required to close her business during the course of repairs,
causing loss of income, profit, business, goodwill, & customers, in an
amount not less than $25,000.00.” (Id. at ¶GN-1.)
 
Defendant moves for summary judgment on the grounds that the
action is barred by the statute of limitations set forth at Code of Civil
Procedure section 335.1 and asserted in the answer filed on June 17, 2022. Defendant
moves for summary judgment on the Complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 437c. A defendant seeking summary judgment must show either (1) that one or more elements
of the cause of action cannot be established; or (2) that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) Plaintiff is under no evidentiary
burden to produce rebuttal evidence until Defendant meets its initial moving
burden. (Binder v. Aetna Life Insurance Company (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th
832, 839-840.) 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 335.1 provides a two-year
statute of limitations for “an action for assault, battery, or injury to, or
for the death of an individual caused by the wrongful act or neglect of
another.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 335.1.) Defendant argues that this statute of
limitations applies to “non-property damage related economic loss” due to
negligence and that Plaintiff is not claiming any property damage. In support
of this, Defendant points to Plaintiff’s own characterization of the damages,
namely that “no property damage is claimed.” (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact
Nos. 5; Exh. 3 at Nos. 107.1, 108.1; Exh. 4, pp. 24:10- 12 and 44:7-13.) This
action, however, was filed more than two years after the April 6, 2019
accident. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 8; Exh. 1.) This evidence
carries Plaintiff’s initial burden of proof to show that the damages sought
fall within the two-year statute of limitations and are time-barred. This
shifts the burden of proof to Plaintiff to demonstrate the existence of a
triable issue of material fact as to the statute of limitations. However, as
Plaintiff has not filed an opposition, no such triable issue of material fact
exists.  
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Hassan Mohamed Adan’s Motion for Summary Judgment is
GRANTED. 
 
DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AND SERVE A PROPOSED JUDGMENT WITHIN 20
DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
