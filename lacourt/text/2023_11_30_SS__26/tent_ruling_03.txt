ANALYSIS: 
 
On June 7, 2022, Plaintiffs Eva Mentado (“Plaintiff
Mentado”) and Jose Gallardo (“Plaintiff Gallardo”)
filed this motor vehicle action against Defendants City of Los Angeles,
Access Services (“Defendant Access”), and Ahmedor Ali (“Defendant Ali”).
Defendants Access and Ali filed an answer and a cross-complaint on October 14,
2022. 
 
On
August 31, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff Gallardo’s Motion to Compel
Deposition and ordered Defendant Ali to appear for deposition. (Minute Order
08/31/23.) On October 3, 2023, Plaintiffs added San Gabriel Transit, Inc. as a
defendant in this action, as Defendant Ali’s employer. 
 
Plaintiff Gallardo filed the instant Motion to Continue
Trial Date on October 18, 2023. The Motion initially was set for hearing on
November 9, 2023 but was continued to November 28, 2023, and than again to
November 30, 2023, with notice waived. (Minute Orders, 11/09/23 and 11/28/23.)
No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion

 
“Although continuances of trials are disfavored, each
request for a continuance must be considered on its own merits. The Court may
grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subd. (c).) The Court may look
to the following factors in determining whether a trial continuance is
warranted: (1) proximity of the trial date; (2) whether there was any previous
continuance of trial due to any party; (3) the length of the continuance
requested; (4) the availability of alternative means to address the problem
that gave rise to the motion; (5) the prejudice that parties or witnesses will
suffer as a result of the continuance; and (6) whether trial counsel is engaged
in another trial.  (See generally, Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subd. (d)(1)-(11).) Additional factors for the
Court to consider include a party’s excused inability to obtain essential
testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts;
whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance; and any other fact or
circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or application. (Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332, subds. (c), (d).)
 
Plaintiff
Gallardo argues that good cause exists for a
continuance of the trial date, which is currently set for December 5, 2023,
because a new defendant—San Gabriel Transit, Inc.—was added to the action on
October 3, 2023 and additional discovery is required. (Motion, Takenouchi
Decl., ¶3.) Defendants have stipulated to the trial continuance. (Id. at
Exh. A.) These circumstances are reasonable grounds to continue the trial date.
Also, there have been no prior trial continuances and there is no prejudice to
the other parties. Indeed, they have stipulated to the continuance. Based on
the foregoing, the Court finds that the factors of Rule 3.1332 weigh in favor
of the requested continuance of the trial date. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Jose Gallardo’s Motion to Continue Trial is
GRANTED. TRIAL DATE IS CONTINUED TO JUNE 4, 2024 AT 8:30 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN
THE SPRING STREET COURTHOUSE. ALL DISCOVERY AND MOTION DATES TO FOLLOW THE NEW
TRIAL DATE.
