And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Bernice Williams' motion to dismiss the case. The motion was filed on May 18, 2023, and was initially set for hearing on August 31, 2023. However, the motion was continued to allow the defendant to provide a supporting memorandum of points and authorities and demonstrate service of the papers on the plaintiff. To date, no additional papers have been filed, and no opposition has been filed. The judge has denied the motion because it was not accompanied by a proof of service demonstrating service of the motion papers and notice of hearing on the plaintiff, and because it was not accompanied by a memorandum of points and authorities as required by the rules of court.
