Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for reconsideration filed by Judgment Debtor Al Perets. The motion was filed in response to the court's order to appear at a judgment debtor examination, which was set for September 6, 2023. Judgment Debtor did not appear at the examination and a bench warrant was issued. The judge found that the motion did not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, which requires a party to show new or different facts or circumstances in support of the motion. The judge also found that Judgment Debtor failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for failing to provide evidence earlier. The judge noted that the declarations filed by Judgment Debtor were not new or different information and that Judgment Debtor had been aware of the examination since August 2, 2023. The judge further noted that Judgment Debtor had not provided any authority to support his contention that the filing of a separate action to challenge the underlying judgment would waive his appearance at the judgment debtor examination or recall the warrant in this action.
