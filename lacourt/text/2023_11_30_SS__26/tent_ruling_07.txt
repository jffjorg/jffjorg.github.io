3 C’s Group Financial, Inc. v. Perets, et al.MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION(CCP § 1008)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Judgment Debtor
Al Peret’s Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
This action was originally filed
on July 11, 1996 by Judgment Creditor 3 C’s Group Financial, Inc. (“Judgment
Creditor”) and against Judgment Debtor Al Perets (“Judgment Debtor”) and
others. Judgment was entered in Judgment Creditor’s favor and against Judgment
Debtor on February 26, 1998. The judgment was renewed on February 1, 2008 and
August 30, 2017. 
 
On February 22, 2023, Judgment
Creditor filed an Application and Order for Appearance and Examination, which
was set for May 9, 2023. (Application and Order, filed 02/22/23.) Judgment
Debtor did not appear on May 9, 2023 but was represented by counsel and the
Court granted Judgment Creditor’s request to issue and hold a bench warrant.
(Minute Order, 05/09/23.) The hearing was continued to August 2, 2023 and
Judgment Debtor was ordered to appear on that date. (Ibid.) 
 
Judgment Debtor filed a
declaration in response to the Order to Appear on July 31, 2023. At the hearing
on August 2, 2023, the Court acknowledged reading the declaration and ordered
the bench warrant held until September 6, 2023. (Minute Order, 08/02/23.) On
September 6, 2023, Judgment Debtor filed declarations but did not appear.
(Minute Order, 09/06/23.) At Judgment Creditor’s request, the bench warrant was
issued and bail was set at $5,000.00. (Ibid.)  
 
Judgment Debtor filed the instant
Motion for Reconsideration of the September 6, 2023 order on September 20,
2023. Judgment Creditor filed an opposition on November 14, 2023 and Judgment
Debtor replied on November 22, 2023.  
 
Discussion
 
The Motion
for Reconsideration is sought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1008,
subdivision (a), which states in relevant part:
 
When an application for an order has been made to a judge, or
to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days
after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based
upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the
same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify,
amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.
 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).) The Court lacks the jurisdiction to reconsider a
prior ruling, on motion of a party, where the motion does not comply with the
requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008,
subd. (e); Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1106.) The
purpose of this jurisdictional bar is to protect the Court from repetitive
motions. (Ibid.) Also, the statute requires the moving party “to show a satisfactory
explanation for failing to provide the evidence earlier, which can only be
described as a strict requirement of diligence” the purpose of which is to
incentivize parties “to efficiently marshall their evidence.” (Baldwin v.
Home Sav. of America (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1192, 1199 [citing Garcia v.
Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 674, 689-690].) 
 
Judgment Debtor has not shown that new or different facts
support the instant Motion. First, the Motion relies on the declarations filed
on September 6, 2023, of which the Court was informed by Judgment Debtor’s
counsel at the hearing. (Minute Order, 09/06/23.) The declarations reiterate
the contents of Judgment Debtor’s August 31, 2023 declaration regarding his
poor health and therefore, provide no new or different information. (See Perets
Decl., filed 08/31/23.) Even if the declarations constitute new and different
information, Judgment Debtor fails to explain why they were not filed prior to
the morning of September 6, 2023. (Motion, Perets Decl., ¶2.) In fact, the
declaration of Karman Kalpari, MD, is dated August 23, 2023. (Kalpari Decl.,
filed 09/06/23, p. 3.) Judgment Debtor has been aware of the September 6, 2023 examination
since August 2, 2023. Yet no explanation is provided for Judgment Debtor’s lack
of diligence in presenting these declarations in either the Motion nor Reply. 
 
Finally, to the extent Judgment Debtor contends that the
filing of a separate action to challenge the underlying judgment is grounds to
waive his appearance at the judgment debtor examination or recall the warrant
in this action, no authority is provided. (Motion, p. 4:8-14; Perets Decl.,
¶4.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the
foregoing, Judgment Debtor Al Peret’s Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED. 
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
