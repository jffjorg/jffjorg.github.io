And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Plaintiff's motion for a charging order to satisfy a judgment debt of $72,296.78 owed by Defendant Ralph Brescia. The Plaintiff, Montgomery Management Company, seeks to charge a membership interest in MR2 Enterprises, LLC to satisfy the judgment. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has demonstrated that the Defendant owes the outstanding balance of the judgment, and that the Defendant has an ownership interest in the LLC. However, the Judge denies the motion as requested due to the Plaintiff's failure to provide proof of interest accrual and calculation, and the Plaintiff's assertion of a 10% interest rate without legal justification. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to provide notice of the ruling and file a proof of service.
