MOTION
 
Plaintiff and Judgment Creditor Montgomery Management Company
(“Plaintiff”) seeks a charging order as to Defendant and Judgment Debtor Ralph
Brescia’s (“Defendant”) membership interest in MR2 Enterprises, LLC to satisfy
the unpaid balance on the judgment entered against Defendant on May 15,
2023.  Plaintiff’s motion is
unopposed.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
            Code of Civil Procedure section
708.310 provides:  “If a money judgment
is rendered against a partner or member but not against the partnership or
limited liability company, the judgment debtor’s interest in the partnership or
limited liability company may be applied toward the satisfaction of the
judgment by an order charging the judgment debtor’s interest pursuant to
Section 15907.03, 16504, or 17705.03 of the Corporations Code.”
 
            Corporations Code section 17705.03,
subdivision (a) provides:  “On
application by a judgment creditor of a member or transferee, a court may enter
a charging order against the transferable interest of the judgment debtor for
the unsatisfied amount of the judgment. A charging order constitutes a lien on
a judgment debtor’s transferable interest and requires the limited liability
company to pay over to the person to which the charging order was issued any
distribution that would otherwise be paid to the judgment debtor.”
 
            Here, judgment was entered against
Defendant and for Plaintiff in the amount of $72,296.78 on May 15, 2023.  (See Judgment.)  Plaintiff has provided evidence that Defendant
is listed as having an ownership interest as a manager or member of MR2
Enterprises LLC on the annual California Secretary of State filing for MR2
Enterprises LLC.  (Stewart Decl. ¶¶ 6-7
and Ex. C.)  The statement of information
lists Defendant’s name and address of record with the Court.  (Ibid.)  
 
            Plaintiff also indicates that on
October 13, 2023, the Sheriff’s Department collected $2,455 from Defendant to
be applied to the outstanding judgment balance. 
(Stewart Decl. ¶ 3.)
 
            Therefore, in general, Plaintiff has
demonstrated that Defendant owes a balance of the judgment, and Defendant has
an ownership interest in MR2 Enterprises LLC, to which Plaintiff may attach to
recover the balance of the judgment.
 
            However, Plaintiff asserts without
any proof that the judgment was entered for $144,616.78, when the judgment
shows $72,296.78.  (Stewart Decl. ¶ 2.)  Plaintiff also asserts that interest accrues
at a rate of 10%, without any legal or evidentiary justification for that
assertion, and that $14,461.68 in interest had accrued on the debt as of
February 5, 2024. (Stewart Decl. ¶ 4.)
 
            While the Court agrees generally
that pre-judgment and post-judgment interest can be awarded, Plaintiff has not
pointed to any order granting such interest. 
Nor has Plaintiff demonstrated that the appropriate interest rate is
10%, or apparently accounted for interest collected on the $2,455 collected by
the Sheriff in October versus the remainder of the outstanding judgment
balance.  Further, Plaintiff appears to
be charging interest upon interest, as opposed to interest on the outstanding principal.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
For the reasons stated, the Court cannot grant Plaintiff’s motion as
requested.  The Court therefore denies
Plaintiff’s motion without prejudice.  
 
Plaintiff shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service regarding the same.
