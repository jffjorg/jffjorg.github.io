And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Petitioner, Fady Ashraf Youssef, filed a petition for relief from Government Code section 945.4, which requires claims against public entities to be filed within a certain timeframe. The Petitioner sustained injuries while exiting a parking structure owned by the City of Los Angeles, but did not realize the severity of his injuries until a medical diagnosis in November 2023. He also was unaware of the City's ownership of the parking structure until January 2024. The Petitioner filed a late claim with the City on February 2, 2024, and the City denied it on April 19, 2024. The Petitioner then filed this petition on May 8, 2024.

The City argues that the Petitioner failed to exercise diligence in filing the claim, but the Court finds that the Petitioner's evidence explains why he did not file the claim sooner. The Court grants the petition for relief, finding that the Petitioner has satisfied the requirements for filing this application and that the City has not established that it would be prejudiced if the Court relieves the Petitioner from the requirements of section 945.4.
