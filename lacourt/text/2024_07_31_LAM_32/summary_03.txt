English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering the plaintiff's motion for trial preference due to his age and health conditions. The plaintiff, Lincoln Alline, is 91 years old and suffers from multiple debilitating conditions, including Parkinson's disease. The judge notes that the issue is not whether the plaintiff might die before trial or become so disabled that he might as well be absent when trial is called, but rather whether the plaintiff's health is such that a trial preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing his interest in the litigation. The judge concludes that the plaintiff has made a sufficient showing to support his motion, and therefore grants the motion. The judge sets the matter for trial not more than 120 days from the date of the order.
