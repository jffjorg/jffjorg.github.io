And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant UHC of California's motions to compel further responses from Plaintiff Heather Toomes. The judge grants the motions in part, ordering Plaintiff to provide further responses to certain discovery requests. The judge finds that Plaintiff has failed to provide sufficient information in response to some requests, including requests for information on the amount and calculation of claimed damages and for identification of documents supporting Plaintiff's allegations. The judge also orders Plaintiff to provide a complete response to Defendant's requests for production of documents. The judge denies Defendant's motion to compel further responses regarding a request for all documents relied on in preparing the complaint, finding that the request is overbroad and violative of attorney-client privilege and work product. The judge sets a deadline of 15 days for Plaintiff to provide further responses.
