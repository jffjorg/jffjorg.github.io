     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
petition for relief from government code
  section 945.4 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On May 8, 2024, Petitioner Fady
Ashraf Youssef filed the instant petition for relief from Government Code
section 945.4. Petitioner seeks to sue the City of Los Angeles for injuries he
sustained while exiting a parking structure owned by the City. The City filed
its opposition on July 24, 2024.  
LEGAL STANDARD
Under the Tort Claims Act, certain claims
must be presented to a public entity before a plaintiff may file a civil action
for damages. (Gov. Code, § 945.4.) A plaintiff must present his claim no later
than six months after the cause of action accrues. (Id., § 911.2(a).) If
a claim is rejected as untimely, a plaintiff may file with the government
entity an application for leave to file a late claim. (Id., § 911.4.) If
this application is rejected, a plaintiff has six months to petition the court
for relief from the requirements of Section 945.4. (Id., § 946.6.) 
A petition under Section 946.6 must show
each of the following: (1) that application was made to the board under Section
911.4 and was denied or deemed denied; (2) the reason for failure to present
the claim within the time limit specified in Section 911.2; and (3) the
information required by Section 910. (Gov. Code, § 946.6(b).) The court shall
grant the requested relief if it finds that “[t]he failure to present the claim
was through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect unless the
public entity establishes that it would be prejudiced in the defense of the
claim if the court relieves the petitioner from the requirements of Section
945.4.” (Id., § 946.6(c)(1).)  
DISCUSSION
            Petitioner filed a late claim with
the City on February 2, 2024. (Rudorfer Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. 1.) Petitioner served
his application for leave to file a late claim on March 5, 2024. (Id., ¶
7, Ex. 2.) The City denied the claim on April 19, 2024. (Id., ¶ 8, Ex.
3.) Petitioner filed this petition on May 8, 2024. Petitioner did not file the
claim on time because he did not realize his injuries until a medical diagnosis
in November 2023. (Id., ¶ 2.) Furthermore, Petitioner mistakenly
believed that the parking structure was privately owned and therefore was not
aware that the City was the proper defendant. (Id., ¶ 3.) 
            The City argues that Petitioner
failed to exercise diligence in filing the claim because Petitioner should have
been aware of the location, cause, and injury from the day of the incident.
(See Munoz v. State of California (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1767, 1783.) However,
Petitioner’s evidence explains why he did not file the claim sooner.
Specifically, Petitioner did not realize the severity of his injuries until a
November 2023 diagnosis, and Petitioner was unaware of the City’s ownership of
the parking structure until he retained counsel in January 2024. (Rudorfer
Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.) 
            The City presents no evidence to
rebut Petitioner’s showing, nor any explanation as to why the facts do not
reflect mistake or excusable neglect. The City’s skepticism as to the proffered
reason does not provide justification to deny the petition. The Court finds
that Petitioner has satisfied the requirements for filing this application.
(See Gov. Code, § 946.6(b).) Relief is mandatory unless the City establishes
that it would be prejudiced. (Id., § 946.6(c)(1).) The City makes no
such showing.
CONCLUSION
            The petition for relief is GRANTED.
