     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to compel compliance
  (CRS# 1759) 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On April 28, 2023, Plaintiffs Lexi
Burrows and Brooklynn Lundberg filed this employment action against Defendants
Touchstone Golf, LLC, Ashley Walston, Peter Wagner, and the City of Burbank.
Plaintiffs assert claims stemming from harassment, discrimination and
retaliation, wrongful termination, and wage violations. Plaintiffs allege that
they experienced and spoke out against sexual harassment and discrimination,
and reported illegal or unsafe working conditions, only to suffer retaliation
for doing so.  
            On November 22, 2023, the Court
granted Plaintiffs’ motions to compel Touchstone Golf to produce further
responses to requests for production, interrogatories, and requests for
admission within 15 days. The Court found Touchstone’s objections based on
arbitration, vagueness, privilege, and privacy to be without merit. The Court
ordered Touchstone to provide a privilege log if Touchstone withheld any
documents based on privilege. 
Touchstone did not provide further
responses within 15 days of November 22, 2023, and in its late supplemental
responses, reasserted the objections previously found meritless. This prompted
Plaintiffs to file a motion for sanctions for noncompliance. On March 8, 2024,
the Court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for sanctions upon finding that Touchstone
provided responses after a minor, inadvertent delay. However, the Court also
found that Touchstone had not completed producing supplemental responses and
ordered Touchstone to complete its production in accordance with the prior
order within 10 days, and also to produce documents in accordance with its own
statements of compliance. The Court also reminded Touchstone of the
previously-overruled objections and the requirement to provide a privilege log
for documents withheld on privilege grounds.  
On July 2, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the
instant motion to compel Touchstone’s compliance with the Court’s November 22,
2023 and March 8, 2024 orders on the grounds that Touchstone still refuses to
produce compliant responses. Touchstone filed its opposition on July 18, 2024. Plaintiffs
filed their reply on July 24, 2024.  
DISCUSSION 
            Touchstone argues that: (i) it
complied with the November 22, 2023 order by producing supplemental responses;
(ii) the March 8, 2024 order concerned Defendant City of Burbank (COB) and is
therefore irrelevant, and Plaintiff improperly filed this single motion
concerning two different prior orders; and (iii) Plaintiff should have filed a
motion to compel further within the statutory deadline if she wanted even
further responses, because items such as “ESI” and “me too evidence” were not
addressed in the November 22, 2023 order.  
While there was a separate order on March
8, 2024 concerning COB’s responses, the March 8 order at issue here is the
motion for sanctions against Touchstone. In that order, the Court found that
Touchstone had not fully complied with the November 22, 2023 order because it
had not finished supplementing its responses and reasserted overruled
objections. (March 8, 2024 Order re Mtn. for Sanctions 3:1-7.) The Court
therefore ordered Touchstone to “provide supplemental responses in accordance
with the Court’s November 22, 2023 order within 10 days.” (Id. at
3:12-14.) The order further stated, “Defendant must also produce documents to
the extent that it responded to the RFPs with statements of compliance.” (Id.
at 3:9-10.)  
The November 22, 2023 and March 8, 2024
orders concern the same issue, i.e., Touchstone’s further responses to
requests for production, interrogatories, and requests for admission. The
November 22, 2023 ruling ordered further responses, while the March 8, 2024
ruling ordered compliance with the November 22, 2023 ruling. Thus, Plaintiff
did not improperly file one motion to address both orders. The ultimate issue
here is whether Touchstone complied with the March 8, 2024 order by producing
supplemental responses within 10 days that comply with the November 22, 2023
order.  
Touchstone did not produce supplemental
responses within 10 days of the March 8, 2024 order. (Schein Decl. ¶ 65.)
Touchstone’s opposition contains no argument or evidence that it produced
anything after March 8, 2024 despite being ordered to, except for one set of
Special Interrogatories that was inadvertently omitted from a prior production.
(Id., ¶ 66; Tong Decl. ¶ 5.) Furthermore, Touchstone does not dispute
that its responses maintain overruled objections. Thus, Touchstone still has
not fully complied with the November 22, 2023 and March 8, 2024 orders. This
does not implicate the 45-day deadline for compelling further responses because
the Court has already ordered further responses, and the issue is whether
Touchstone has complied with those orders.
Touchstone must also produce documents in
accordance with its statements of compliance. As to ESI, the instructions on
the RFPs state that “[e]lectronically stored information shall be produced in
native format or, should the parties agree, in some other mutually agreeable
format.” (See, e.g., Schein Decl., Ex. 2.) To the extent Touchstone
responded to the RFPs with statements of compliance, it did so without
objecting to this instruction. Thus, Touchstone agreed to produce ESI in native
format, as the parties did not agree to another format. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiffs’ motion to compel
compliance is GRANTED. Touchstone shall produce supplemental responses and
responsive documents within 15 days of this order. The production shall comply
with the Court’s November 22, 2023 order. ESI shall be produced in native
format.
