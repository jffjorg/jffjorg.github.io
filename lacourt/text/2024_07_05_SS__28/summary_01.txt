The judge has considered the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Khashayar Eshraghi, Esq. on behalf of Plaintiff Bridgette Stoval. The motion has been completed, filed, and served in accordance with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. Although the proofs of service only show service on the Plaintiff, Metro's counsel appeared at the hearing and confirmed receipt of the moving papers. The Court grants the motion and orders counsel to be relieved as counsel upon filing proof of service on the Plaintiff of the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel--Civil (Judicial Council form MC-053). Counsel is also ordered to give notice of this ruling and file the proof of service with the Court within five days.
