And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motions, opposition, and reply papers in this case and has ruled that the defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment and default is denied. The judge found that the plaintiff properly served the statement of damages on the defendant through substituted service, which is allowed under California law. The judge also found that the defendant failed to provide any facts supporting a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5. Therefore, the judge denied the defendant's motion and upheld the default judgment entered against the defendant.
