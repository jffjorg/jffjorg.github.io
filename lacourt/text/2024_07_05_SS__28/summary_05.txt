And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving motor vehicle tort and general negligence. The Plaintiffs, Velveth Milena Ibarra Orozco and Oscar Canales Jule, have filed a motion to compel the Defendant, Samuel Vallez, to appear for a deposition and for sanctions. The Defendant did not appear for his noticed deposition and has served objections to some of the deposition notices. However, the Plaintiffs have not provided the required declaration to accompany their motion, as mandated by Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450. Additionally, the Defendant is currently incarcerated, and the Court will not compel his deposition without additional information about the Plaintiffs' compliance with any requirements or procedures for conducting a deposition in a Los Angeles County jail facility. Therefore, the Court denies the Plaintiffs' motion and request for sanctions.
