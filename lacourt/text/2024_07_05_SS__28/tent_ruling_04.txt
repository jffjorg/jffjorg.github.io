 Case Number:  21STCV40047    Hearing Date:   July 5, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On November  1, 2021, Plaintiffs Pablo Quezada Santoyo, Maria Torres Lopez, Ashley  Lopez, a minor, and Erik Quezada, a minor, by and through their guardian ad  litem Maria Torres Lopez, filed  this action against Defendants Yihe Qi  and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence.  On February 18, 2022, the Court appointed Maria Torres  Lopez to serve as Plaintiff Ashley Lopez’s guardian ad litem.   On  February 22, 2022, the Court appointed Maria Torres Lopez to serve as Plaintiff  Erik Quezada’s guardian ad litem.  On December  21, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement.  On June 4, 2024, Petitioner Maria Torres Lopez (“Petitioner”)  filed a petition for expedited approval of the compromise of minor Plaintiff Eric Quezada’s  action.  On  June 13, 2024, Petitioner filed a petition for expedited approval of the  compromise of minor Plaintiff Ashley Torres’s action.  PETITIONER’S REQUESTS  Petitioner  asks the Court for expedited approval of the compromises of the actions of minor  Plaintiffs Eric Quezada and Ashley Torres.  DISCUSSION  A.   Petition for expedited approval of the compromise of Plaintiff Eric  Quezada’s action  The  Court finds that the petition for expedited approval of the compromise of minor Plaintiff Eric  Quezada’s claims is complete and contains all necessary information.  The Court  grants the petition and orders that the net settlement  amount of $615.34 be paid or delivered to Maria Torres Lopez at 5678 Shull  Street, Space 36, Bell, California 90201 on the terms and under the conditions  specified in Probate Code sections 3401-3402, without bond.  B.   Petition for expedited approval of the compromise of Plaintiff Ashley  Torres’s action  Section  13a(1) of the petition for expedited approval of the compromise of minor Plaintiff Ashley Torres's action states that total medical expenses were $7,197.00.  Section 13a(3) of the petition states that  this amount was reduced by $3,782.66 as the result of negotiated, contractual,  and statutory reductions.  This should  mean that $3,414.34 (the difference between the total medical expenses and the  amount of reductions) will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement  proceeds.  However, Section 13a(4) of the  petition states that only $3,250.00 of the medical expenses will be paid or  reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.   As a result, $164.34 of the medical expenses are unaccounted for.  The Court cannot grant a petition to approve  a minor’s compromise unless it shows that all medical expenses that have not  been waived or reduced will be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  The  Court denies the petition for expedited approval of the compromise of minor Plaintiff Ashley Torres’s claims  without prejudice.  CONCLUSION  The  Court GRANTS the petition for expedited approval of the compromise of minor  Plaintiff Eric Quezada’s action filed by Petitioner Maria Torres Lopez on June 4,  2024. The Court orders the net settlement amount of $615.34 to be paid or delivered to Maria  Torres Lopez at 5678 Shull Street, Space 36, Bell, California 90201 on the  terms and under the conditions specified in Probate Code sections 3401-3402,  without bond.  The  Court DENIES without prejudice the petition for expedited approval of the compromise  of minor Plaintiff Ashley Torres’s action filed by Petitioner Maria Torres  Lopez on June 13, 2024.  Petitioner  is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Petitioner  is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within  five days.
