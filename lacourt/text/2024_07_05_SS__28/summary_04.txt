And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has considered the petitioning papers and rules as follows. The case concerns motor vehicle tort and general negligence between Plaintiffs Pablo Quezada Santoyo, Maria Torres Lopez, Ashley Lopez, and Erik Quezada, who are represented by their guardian ad litem Maria Torres Lopez, against Defendants Yihe Qi and Does 1-50.

The Court grants the petition for expedited approval of the compromise of minor Plaintiff Eric Quezada's action, ordering that the net settlement amount of $615.34 be paid or delivered to Maria Torres Lopez.

However, the Court denies the petition for expedited approval of the compromise of minor Plaintiff Ashley Torres's action without prejudice, as the petition does not account for all medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced. The Court orders Petitioner Maria Torres Lopez to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service with the Court within five days.
