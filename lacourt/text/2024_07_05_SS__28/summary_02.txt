And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has considered the petitioning papers and rules as follows. The action was filed on April 6, 2021, by Plaintiffs Jazeer Keyes, Tanya Davis, Jae'yon Wagner, and Tamila Wagner against Defendant Lenita Sinna Dee Lewis and Does 1-100 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. The Court appointed Tamila Wagner as Jae'yon Wagner's guardian ad litem on April 27, 2021. On June 12, 2024, Tanya Davis and Tamila Wagner filed petitions to approve the compromise of Keyes's and Jae'yon Wagner's actions, respectively.

The Court denies both petitions. The Court finds that Tanya Davis does not have the authority to compromise Keyes's claims and that she has failed to provide required documents. The Court also finds that Tamila Wagner has failed to provide required attachments and that the statement about a guardianship of the estate appears to be incorrect.

The Court orders petitioners to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
