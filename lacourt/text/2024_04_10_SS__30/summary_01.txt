  - "The essence of a Bane Act claim is that the defendant, by the specified improper means (i.e., “threats, intimidation or coercion”), tried to or did prevent the plaintiff from doing something he or she had the right to do under the law or to force the plaintiff to do something that he or she was not required to do under the law."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling concerns a demurrer filed by the defendant, Belcalis Marlenis Almanzar, against the plaintiff, Emani Ellis. The demurrer argues that the plaintiff's fifth cause of action, which alleges a violation of the Bane Act, fails to state a cause of action. The judge agrees with the defendant's argument, finding that the plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action under the Bane Act. The judge also finds that the defendant's demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff cannot amend the complaint to cure the defects identified in the demurrer.
