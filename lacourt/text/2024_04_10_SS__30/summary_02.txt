```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied as moot. The plaintiff filed an amended complaint on December 7, 2023, which supersedes the original complaint. As a result, the defendant's motion, which was based on the original complaint, is no longer relevant. The judge cites the case of State Compensation Ins. Fund v. Superior Court (2010) 184 Cal. App. 4th 1124, 1130-1131, which holds that an amended complaint moots a motion directed to a prior complaint. Therefore, the defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied as moot.
