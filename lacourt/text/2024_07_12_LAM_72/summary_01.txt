And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling that California is the proper forum for this action. The case involves a real estate transaction in which the plaintiff, Morgan Bottehsazan, and defendants, Ramin Zakarya, Elizabeth Zakarya, Fred Yazdanpanah, and Empire State Commercial Properties Corp., negotiated and entered into an oral agreement regarding the commission to be received from the sale of the property. The property is located in New York, and the parties have connections to both California and New York.

The defendants argued that California is not the proper forum because the controversy did not arise in California and none of the defendants reside in California. However, the judge found that California is a proper forum for this action, citing the doctrine of forum non conveniens, which allows the court to decline to exercise jurisdiction over a transitory cause of action when it believes that the action may be more appropriately and justly tried elsewhere.

The judge rejected the defendants' argument, finding that the doctrine of forum non conveniens has extremely limited application where the plaintiff is a California resident, as is the case here. The judge also found that the parties have sufficient connections to California, including the negotiation of the purchase agreement in California and the plaintiff's residence in California.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further briefing and argument from the parties.
