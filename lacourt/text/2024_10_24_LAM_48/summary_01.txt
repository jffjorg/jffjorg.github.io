**Significant Statements:**
	* The Court cannot find that less severe sanctions would be ineffective and that terminating sanctions are warranted.
	* The Court will not impose the requested broad order that Plaintiff cannot introduce any evidence at trial.
	* Plaintiff's failure to comply with a single order to produce discovery does not demonstrate a history of abuse that justifies "the ultimate sanction."
	* The Court determines that sanctions are appropriate against counsel, not the client, because no oppositions were filed and no explanation was provided for the failure to respond to discovery.
