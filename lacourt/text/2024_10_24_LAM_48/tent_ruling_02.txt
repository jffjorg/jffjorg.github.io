[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING IN PART PLAINTIFF’S
  MOTION FOR ATTORNEY FEES AND EXPENSES 
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 24, 2024



 
Plaintiff
Melissa Bontempt and Defendants FCA US LLC and H.W. Hunter Inc. CDJR have reached
a settlement in this Song-Beverly action. 
On June 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for attorney fees, along with a
memorandum of costs.
As
the prevailing party, Plaintiff is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees
and expenses.  (Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d).)  California courts apply the “lodestar” approach
to determine what fees are reasonable.  (See,
e.g., Holguin v. DISH Network LLC (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1332.)  This inquiry “begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e.,
the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.”  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095.)  From there, the “lodestar figure
may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the case, in
order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.”  (Ibid.)  Relevant factors include “(1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them,
(3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment
by the attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1132.)  The party seeking fees has the burden
of documenting the appropriate hours expended and hourly rates.  (City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 751, 784.)
Plaintiff
requests a total of $28,217.61, consisting of $26,319.00 in attorney fees and $1,898.61
in costs and expenses.
Plaintiff
provides a copy of counsel’s billing records. 
(Saeedian Decl., Ex. A.)  Plaintiff’s
counsel charges various hourly rates: $695 for Michael Saeedian (24.2 hours); $525
for Christopher Urner (5.8 hours); and $250 (15.6 hours) or $350 (7.3 hours) for
Jorge L. Acosta.
The
Court finds that rates greater than $495 are unreasonably high for such a straightforward
lemon law action.  Accordingly, the Court
recalculates the fees using a maximum rate of $495, resulting in the following deductions:
$4,840.00 for Michael Saeedian (minus $200/hour for 24.2 hours) and $174.00 for
Christopher Urner (minus $30/hour for 5.8 hours).  This results in a total deduction of $5,014.00,
and a revised total of $21,305.00 in attorney fees.
Defendants
did not file any oppositions.  Accordingly,
the Court will not award fees for the time anticipatorily billed for reviewing an
opposition and drafting a reply (3 hours by Michael Saeedian).  The Court deducts $1,485.00 ($495/hour for 3 hours).
The
unopposed motion for attorney fees and expenses is GRANTED IN PART.  The Court awards Plaintiff $19,820.00 in attorney
fees ($21,305.00 minus $1,485.00) and $1,898.61 in costs and expenses.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
