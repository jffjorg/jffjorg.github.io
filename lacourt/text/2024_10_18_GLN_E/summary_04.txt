And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to strike the first cause of action, which is the negligence claim, because the defendants have made a prima facie showing that the allegations in the complaint arise from protected activity. The court finds that the defendants' alleged statements to the police are subject to the anti-SLAPP statute, and that the plaintiff has not established a probability of prevailing on his claims.

The tentative ruling denies the defendants' motion to strike the second cause of action, which is the conversion claim, because the court finds that the allegations in the complaint do not arise from an act performed in furtherance of the defendants' right of petition or free speech.

The court also grants the defendants' request to strike certain allegations and causes of action, including portions of Paragraph 11, and denies other requests. Finally, the court awards the defendants $20,552.29 in attorneys' fees and costs, as requested.
