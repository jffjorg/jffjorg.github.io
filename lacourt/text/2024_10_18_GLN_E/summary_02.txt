```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the Plaintiff's application for a writ of possession and finds that the Plaintiff has failed to comply with several requirements. The Court cannot determine if the moving papers were timely served, and a proof of service was not filed for the moving papers. Additionally, the Court cannot determine what address Plaintiff served Defendant at, and it is unclear what the proper service address is for Defendant.

The Court finds that the Plaintiff has not established probable validity of its claim, and the Plaintiff has not filed an undertaking as required. The Court will hear argument as to the undertaking requirements and will consider continuing the hearing and future dates to allow for the Plaintiff to remedy some of the issues raised in this tentative.

The Court notes that the Plaintiff's application for a writ of possession is similar to another writ of possession filed earlier, and the Court incorporates all of the above from that writ of possession into this tentative ruling.
