And here is the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that Airbnb's demurrer is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. The Judge finds that the statute of limitations has expired on all four causes of action against Airbnb, and that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to show that Airbnb had a duty to protect the Plaintiffs from third-party criminal conduct. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiffs have failed to explain how they can amend the complaint to properly allege a duty of care by Airbnb.

The Judge notes that the complaint fails to provide specific allegations relating to crimes that had occurred on the property in the past, and that the Plaintiffs have failed to show how the services provided by Airbnb were of the kind that Airbnb should have recognized as necessary for the protection of third persons.

The Judge also finds that the Plaintiffs have failed to plead or explain what negligent act Airbnb took that increased the risk of harm beyond what existed without the undertaking, or how the undertaking was relied upon.

As a result, the Judge is denying the Plaintiffs' request for leave to amend and sustaining Airbnb's demurrer without leave to amend.
