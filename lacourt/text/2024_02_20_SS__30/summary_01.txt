```

Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Defendant's motion for summary judgment or adjudication as to the causes of action for negligence and premises liability. The Judge finds that there are triable issues of fact as to whether the Defendant owed a duty to the Plaintiff, whether the Defendant could have prevented the physical altercation, and whether the Defendant was negligent in hiring or supervising the sales manager, Vandermeer. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to show that the Defendant's failure to exercise reasonable care to prevent the harm was a substantial factor in causing the harm. The Judge overrules the Defendant's evidentiary objections and orders the Plaintiff to give notice and the moving party to give notice.
