And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication as to all of the defendant's affirmative defenses. The plaintiff argued that the defendant had no facts to support its affirmative defenses, relying on the defendant's response to form interrogatories. However, the judge found that the plaintiff did not meet its burden to show that the defendant cannot reasonably obtain the necessary evidence. Additionally, the plaintiff did not offer any evidence to support its motion for the vast majority of the affirmative defenses. The judge also denied the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication on the issue of comparative negligence as to Doris Staub-Gasser, as she had already dismissed her case against the defendant.
