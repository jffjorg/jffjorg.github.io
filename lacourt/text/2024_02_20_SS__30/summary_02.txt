And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by the Judge states that the default judgment is off-calendar due to the Plaintiff's dismissals of certain defendants. The Plaintiff has dismissed Doe 1-100 and RLCS, Inc. on January 3 and 16, 2024, respectively. The Court has reviewed the request for default judgment and has identified several defects that must be corrected before it can be granted. These defects include the failure to dismiss other defendants (Lisa and Kyle), excessive general damages, failure to list costs, lack of proof of damages, and insufficiently authenticated evidence. The Court is not inclined to award general damages in an amount that is more than three times special damages. The Plaintiff must seek to set aside the dismissals before the Court can rule on a default judgment.
