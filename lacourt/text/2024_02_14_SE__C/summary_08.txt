And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., had argued that the plaintiff's claims arise from the Retail Installment Sales Contract (RISC) and that equitable estoppel applies to compel arbitration. The judge disagreed, holding that the plaintiff's claims arise from the defendant's statutory obligation and not from the sale contract. The judge found that the RISC did not include any warranty or assurance regarding the quality of the vehicle, and that the plaintiff's claims do not arise directly out of the RISC. Therefore, the defendant may not compel arbitration because the plaintiff's claims are not intimately founded in or intertwined with the RISC.
