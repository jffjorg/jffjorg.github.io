#Add-On
 
Plaintiff’s Demurrer to Defendant City of
Hawthorne’s Answer is OVERRULED.
Opposing to give NOTICE.
 
Plaintiff Michael Shipp (Plaintiff) demurs to
Defendant City of Hawthorne’s Answer to his Complaint. 
Background
This
discrimination action was filed on July 14, 2023. Plaintiff alleges that
Defendant City of Hawthorne (Defendant) lacked probable cause to arrest
Plaintiff for a violation of the Vehicle Code §10851(A). The Complaint asserts
the following causes of action: 
(1)
Violation of Civil Rights for Unlawful Seizure and Arrest; 
(2)
Violation of Civil Rights: Entity Liability; 
(3)
False Arrest/False Imprisonment in Violation of Penal Code §236;
(4)
Negligence; and 
(5)
Government Code Violation.
On
August 23, 2023 Defendant filed the subject Answer (“Answer”) to Plaintiff’s
Complaint. In its Answer, Defendant asserts a general denial, and ten
affirmative defenses. Plaintiff now demurs to Defendant’s First through Thirty-Fifth
Affirmative Defenses, arguing that Defendant’s affirmative defenses are no more
than legal theories or conclusions of law.
Legal
Standard
A
demurrer to an answer is properly sustained where “[t]he answer does not state
facts sufficient to constitute a defense.” (CCP §430.20(a).) However, it is
well-settled that an answer alleging affirmative defenses need only plead
ultimate facts (e.g. Welch v. Derian (1964) 224 Cal.App.2d 750, 754) and
there is a fine line between ultimate facts and mere conclusions of law. (See,
e.g., Bank of Italy v. Wetzel (1927) 82 Cal.App.240, 243.) Moreover, the
sufficiency of an answer is considered in the context of the allegations of the
complaint. (South Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725,
733.)
Discussion

Here, the court determines that the Defendant’s
affirmative defenses are sufficient when considered in the context of the
allegations in the Complaint. Moreover, there is no prejudice to these
affirmative defenses since any residual uncertainty in the pleading can be
resolved through discovery. Plaintiff may seek further factual information
related to each affirmative defense through discovery. The demurrer is
OVERRULED as to the First through Thirty-Fifth affirmative defenses. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
Demurrer is OVERRULED as to all affirmative defenses.
