CASE NO.:  22NWCV00965
HEARING:   2/14/24 @ 9:30 AM
#3
 
Plaintiff’s Motions to Compel and Requests
for Sanctions are DENIED as moot.
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Plaintiff Nicolas Romo Becerra (Plaintiff) moves
to compel further responses to his Special Interrogatories and Requests for
Production and moves to compel compliance with Defendant FCA US LLC’s
(Defendant) statement of compliance in response to his Requests for Production.
On December 28, 2023, this Court ordered that
the parties meet and confer further and submit a joint statement regarding the
remaining issues. No joint statement was received. Thus, the Court shall assume
there are no outstanding issues.
Sanctions 
The court shall impose a monetary sanction
against the party who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel
further responses to interrogatories or demand for production of documents
unless the party subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or the sanction would otherwise be unjust. (Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300,
subd. (d), 2031.310, subd. (h), 2033.290, subd. (d).) 
The Court finds that Defendant acted with
substantial justification because discovery issues could have been resolved
through further meet and confer efforts.
