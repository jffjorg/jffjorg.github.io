The motion is related to the plaintiff's lemon law action. The original hearing date for the motion was April 23, 2024, but the judge has advanced it to March 26, 2024 due to the potential for irreparable harm if the motion is not heard before the discovery cut-off date. The judge finds that the plaintiff would be harmed if the defendant is not required to provide further responses before the discovery cut-off date.
