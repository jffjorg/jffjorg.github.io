And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendant's demurrer is untimely. The defendant demurred to the plaintiff's complaint on the grounds of res judicata and collateral estoppel, alleging that the plaintiff's claims are barred by a previous lawsuit. However, the defendant filed the demurrer three months after the plaintiff's answer, which is outside the 30-day timeframe allowed by California Civil Procedure Code (CCP) § 430.40(a). The judge notes that while there was a stay in the case for the plaintiff's bankruptcy proceedings, this does not excuse the defendant's delay in filing the demurrer. The judge therefore overrules the demurrer as untimely.
