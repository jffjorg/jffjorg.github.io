```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the California Constitution because the Legislature's retroactive elimination of the government claim requirement for child sexual abuse cases is unconstitutional. The judge found that the Legislature's determination that deterring future sexual abuse against minor students is a worthy public purpose is properly a matter for the Legislature to decide, and this Court shall not disturb such legislative discretion so long as the Legislature appears to have had a reasonable basis for its conclusions. The judge also found that AB 218's legislative history demonstrates that the Legislature enacted the bill to expand access to justice for the victims of childhood sexual assault as a means of preventing similar abuses by future perpetrators. Therefore, the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied.
