```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Cerritos has moved for a protective order to prevent the plaintiffs from deposing three city council members who may have information about notice of uplifts on the sidewalk where the plaintiff fell. The judge has granted the motion, finding that the plaintiffs have failed to exhaust less intrusive discovery methods and failed to establish that the council members have personal knowledge of the case. The judge cites the "Apex Doctrine" and the case of Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1282, which held that it is an abuse of discretion to allow a party to depose a corporate officer at the apex of the corporate hierarchy without a reasonable indication of the officer's personal knowledge of the case and without exhaustion of less intrusive discovery methods. The judge orders that the plaintiffs are prohibited from deposing the council members, Bruce Barrows, Naresh Solanki, and Choung Vo.
