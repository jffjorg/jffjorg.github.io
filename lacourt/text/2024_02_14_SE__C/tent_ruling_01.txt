Defendant’s Demurrer is OVERRULED as
untimely..
Moving Party to give NOTICE.
 
Defendant Martha Moreno (Defendant) demurs to
Plaintiff Erik Moreno’s (Plaintiff) Complaint on the grounds of res judicata
and collateral estoppel.
Background
Plaintiff
originally filed a complaint in this Court on July 12, 2016 against Defendant
for Quiet Title to real properties commonly known as 10231 Trabuco Street,
Bellflower, California 90706 and 11829 Arkansas Street (collectively the
Properties). Plaintiff dismissed his complaint against Defendant on August 11,
2021. On January 29, 2019, Defendant filed a cross-complaint against Plaintiff
for:
1.   
Breach
of Fiduciary Duty
2.   
Conversion
3.   
Waste
4.   
Unjust
Enrichment
5.   
Constructive
Trust
6.   
Intentional
Misrepresentation
7.   
Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress
8.   
Declaratory
Relief
Defendant
claimed that Plaintiff acquired title to the Properties due to a breach of
fiduciary duty, conversion, and fraud. Default was entered against Plaintiff on
May 10, 2019 as to the cross-complaint and judgment was entered on May 10,
2022. Plaintiff has appealed the default. 
Plaintiff
then filed this Complaint on May 20, 2022 against Defendant which contains
numerous identical allegations. Defendant answered on June 20, 2022 and then
filed a demurrer on September 26, 2022. The case was stayed for Plaintiff’s
bankruptcy proceedings on October 28, 2022, before the demurrer could be heard.
Defendant refiled her demurrer on December 22, 2023 after the stay had been
lifted.
Legal
Standard
The
party against whom a complaint has been filed may object to the pleading, by
demurrer, on several grounds, including the ground that the pleading does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. (CCP § 430.10(e).) A
party may demur to an entire complaint, or to any causes of action stated
therein. (CCP § 430.50(a).) “‘[A] demurrer based on an affirmative defense will
be sustained only where the face of the complaint discloses that the action is
necessarily barred by the defense.’” (McKenney v. Purepac Pharmaceutical Co.
(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 72, 78-79.)
Discussion

Defendant’s Demurrer is untimely. “A person against whom a
complaint or cross-complaint has been filed may, within 30 days after service
of the complaint or cross-complaint, demur to the complaint or cross-complaint.”
(CCP § 430.40(a).) In McAllister
v. County of Monterey
(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 253, 280, the Court ruled that CCP § 430.40 granted
courts discretion to allow demurrers to be filed outside of the statutory 30
day time period. In McAllister a trial court sustained part of a
demurrer which was filed outside of the 30 day time period due to a stay in the
case. (Id. at 281.) While there was a stay in this case for Plaintiff’s
bankruptcy proceedings, the original demurrer was filed three months after her
answer. Thus, the original demurrer was untimely and the Court, under its
discretion, finds no excusing circumstances like those in McAllister.
Therefore, the Demurrer is overruled as untimely. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant’s
Demurrer is OVERRULED as untimely.
