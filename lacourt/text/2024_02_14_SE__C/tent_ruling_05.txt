 Case Number:  22NWCV01287    Hearing Date:   February 14, 2024    Dept:  C Yolisma Martinez vs American Honda Motor Co., Inc.,
Case No. 22NWCV01287
 
This is a lemon law action. 
 
A party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual
showing "irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis
for granting relief ex parte." (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1202(c).)
 
Trial in this matter is scheduled for May 30, 2024, with the
last date to hear discovery motions set for May 15, 2024. Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel is not set to be heard until April 23, 2024, which would leave little
time for Defendant to provide further responses prior to the discovery cut-off
for the current trial date in the event Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel is
granted. The Court finds that Plaintiff would be irreparably harmed by not
allowing the motion to be heard prior to the discovery cut-off dates. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff Yolisma Martinez’s Ex Parte
Application to ADVANCE the hearing date for her Motion to Compel Further
Responses to Special Interrogatories and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED. The
Hearing for the Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories
and Request for Sanctions is ADVANCED from Tuesday, April 23, 2024 and
CONTINUED to Tuesday, March 26, 2024 in Department SE-C at 9:30 a.m.
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
