And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendant's ex parte application to advance the hearing date for his demurrer. The demurrer was originally scheduled for August 28, 2024, but the judge finds that the defendant would be irreparably harmed if the demurrer is not heard prior to trial, which is currently set for May 2, 2024. Therefore, the hearing for the demurrer is advanced from August 28, 2024 to March 21, 2024. The defendant is required to give notice of the new hearing date.
