 Case Number:  22NWCV00977    Hearing Date:   February 14, 2024    Dept:  C Joseph Construction vs Andy Tran, Case No. 22NWCV00977
 
This is a breach of contract action, resulting from work
allegedly done on a property of the Defendant.  Defendant Andy Tran files
this ex parte application for an order shortening time to hear Defendant’s
Demurrer to Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint.
 
A party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual
showing "irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis
for granting relief ex parte." (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1202(c).)
 
Currently, the Demurrer is scheduled for August 28, 2024,
and trial is currently set for May 2, 2024. The Court finds that Defendant
would be irreparably harmed by not allowing the demurrer to be heard prior to
trial. 
 
Accordingly, Defendant Andy Tran’s Ex Parte Application to
ADVANCE the hearing date for Demurrer is GRANTED. The Hearing for Demurrer is
ADVANCED from Thursday August 22, 2024 and CONTINUED to Thursday March 21, 2024
in Department SE-C at 10:30 a.m.
 
Defendant to give notice.
