And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a discrimination action filed by Michael Shipp against the City of Hawthorne. Shipp alleges that the city lacked probable cause to arrest him and is seeking damages. The city filed an answer with 10 affirmative defenses, which Shipp demurred to, arguing that they are mere legal theories or conclusions of law. The judge has overruled Shipp's demurrer, finding that the city's affirmative defenses are sufficient when considered in the context of the allegations in the complaint. The judge notes that there is no prejudice to these defenses and that any residual uncertainty can be resolved through discovery. Therefore, the demurrer is overruled as to all affirmative defenses.
