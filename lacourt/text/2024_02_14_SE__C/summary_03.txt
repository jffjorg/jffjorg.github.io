And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and requests for production, as well as the request for sanctions. The court finds that the defendant acted with substantial justification in not complying with the plaintiff's discovery requests, as the issues could have been resolved through further meet and confer efforts. As a result, the court denies the plaintiff's motions as moot and orders the defendant to provide notice. Additionally, the court imposes a monetary sanction against the defendant, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300, 2031.310, and 2033.290. The hearing is scheduled for February 14, 2024, at 9:30 AM.
