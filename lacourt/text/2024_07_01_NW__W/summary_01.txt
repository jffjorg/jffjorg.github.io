And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories from the defendant, FCA US LLC, in part. The motion seeks further discovery responses to interrogatories 45-48, which seek repair rates and information related to the top five symptoms and components replaced in 2020 RAM 1500 vehicles. The plaintiffs argue that this information is relevant to proving their claims under the Song-Beverly Act and would help show whether a widespread defect or nonconformity exists in these vehicles.

The judge found that the defendant's initial responses were not code-compliant and that the plaintiffs made a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the issue through meet and confer discussions. The judge also ordered the defendant to verify its supplemental responses and to produce any additional documents that have been discovered.

The judge denied the plaintiffs' request for sanctions, finding that the requests were extremely overbroad at their inception and only became answerable through the meet and confer process. The judge also noted that the plaintiffs agreed to the narrowed response provided by the defendant, which would not have been ordered if the plaintiffs had not agreed to it.
