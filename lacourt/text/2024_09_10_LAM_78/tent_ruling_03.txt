[TENTATIVE] RULING
  RE: 
 
DEFENDANT BMW FINANCIAL SERVICES NA, LLC’S DEMURRER TO THE
  COMPLAINT AND, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, MOTION TO COMPEL ARBITRATION AND STAY
  ACTION
 



 
Defendant
BMW Financial Services NA, LLC’s demurrer is CONTINUED to November 19, 2024. Both
parties filed untimely papers, so the Court will need additional time to
consider the arguments. In addition, the Court puts BMW on notice that at the
continued hearing, the Court will only consider the demurrer. If BMW wishes to compel
arbitration, BMW must file and serve a separate motion, and reserve a separate
hearing date. To the extent the issues are related, the Court will consider hearing
the motions together once a separate motion is filed and hearing date reserved.
No further briefing will be permitted for the Demurrer.
