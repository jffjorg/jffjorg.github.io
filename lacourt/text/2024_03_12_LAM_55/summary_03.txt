And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to set aside the entry of default. The defendant brought the motion, arguing that the default was entered due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. However, the judge found that the defendant knew of the default but did not take any action to remedy the situation, despite having retained new counsel well within the six-month deadline to seek relief. The judge concluded that the defendant's motion was untimely, lacked diligence, and demonstrated inexcusable neglect. As a result, the motion was denied.
