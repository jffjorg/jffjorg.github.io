And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Volkswagen Group Of America, Inc. to compel the deposition of Eyal Claud Cohen, the plaintiff in a Lemon Law Complaint. The judge finds that the defendant adequately showed that the plaintiff did not attend the deposition and that the defendant inquired about the nonattendance. Therefore, the judge grants the motion to compel the deposition. However, the judge is disappointed in the way counsel dealt with the scheduling of the deposition, citing a lack of effort to find a mutually agreeable date. The judge orders the parties to meet and confer prior to the hearing to schedule a deposition date within one month of the hearing. The judge also denies both parties' requests for sanctions, citing a lack of effort to resolve the scheduling issue.
