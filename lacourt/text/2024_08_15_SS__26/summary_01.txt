And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the Motion for Reconsideration filed by respondents Lisa Holder, Esq. and Law Offices of Lisa Holder is denied. The motion was brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, which allows a party to seek reconsideration of a prior ruling based on new or different facts, circumstances, or law. However, the judge finds that the respondents did not act with diligence in bringing the motion, as they did not appear at the hearing on June 24, 2024, and did not challenge the arbitration award in a timely manner. The judge also finds that the respondents' misunderstanding regarding the time for filing a response to the petition should have been raised at the time of the hearing. As a result, the judge denies the motion for reconsideration.
