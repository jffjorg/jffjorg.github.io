Automobile Insurance Company’s Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement is GRANTED.

ANALYSIS:
 
On October 8,
2008, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”)
filed this subrogation action against Defendant Brandy Kabonic (“Defendant”).
Defendant filed an answer on January 22, 2009. On June 16, 2009, Plaintiff filed a copy of the parties’
settlement agreement with a request for dismissal and retention of jurisdiction
under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The Court dismissed the action
pursuant to the stipulation on the same date. (Order for Dismissal, 06/16/09.) 
 
On July 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant
Motion to Vacate Dismissal, Enforce Settlement, and Enter Judgment. To date, no
opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
 
The instant motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure, section
664.6, which states in relevant part:
 
If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd.
(a).) Prior to January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the
litigants themselves, not their attorneys. 
(Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.) The current
statute provides that “parties” includes “an attorney who represents the party”
and an insurer’s agent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b).) The settlement
must include the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement,
and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v.
Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) The settlement agreement complies
with the statutory requirements set forth above because it was signed by both
parties and their attorneys. (Motion, Reese Decl., Exh. A, p. 5.)
 
Furthermore,
the request for retention of jurisdiction must be made in writing, by the
parties, before the action is dismissed for the Court’s retention of
jurisdiction to conform to the statutory language. (Wackeen v. Malis
(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 433 [“If, after a suit has been dismissed, a party
brings a section 664.6 motion for a judgment on a settlement agreement but
cannot present to the court a request for retention of jurisdiction that meets
all of these requirements, then enforcement of the agreement must be left to a
separate lawsuit.”].) The parties’ request for retention of jurisdiction
complies with these requirements because it was made in writing to the Court
before the action was dismissed. (Motion, Reese Decl., Exh. A, ¶G.) 
 
The settlement provides that
Defendant would pay Plaintiff $22,905.12 through an initial payment from
Defendant’s insurer of $5,000.00, followed by Defendant’s monthly payments
starting on June 20, 2009. (Id. at Exh. A, ¶A.) The settlement agreement
also provides that in the event of Defendant’s default, Plaintiff may seek
judgment in the settlement amount, less any monies paid. (Ibid.) Payments
of $5,200.00 were made towards the settlement, after which Defendant defaulted.
(Id. at ¶¶4-5 and Exh. C.) Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff is entitled
to entry of judgment against Defendant in the amount of $17,705.12 principal ($22,905.12-
$5,200.00). (Id. at ¶8.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company’s Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement is GRANTED.
JUDGMENT TO BE ENTERED IN PLAINTIFF’S FAVOR AND AGAINST DEFENDANT BRANDY
KABONIC IN THE AMOUNT OF $17,705.12 PRINCIPAL.
