ANALYSIS:
 
On April 22, 2024, Plaintiff Malaga
Properties, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for breach of contract and related claims against
Defendants Ava Inc. dba Reliable Roofing And Retro-Fit (“Defendant Ava,
Inc.”), Vahe Kalashyan, and Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance. The First Amended
Complaint was filed on April 30, 2024. 
 
Defendant Ava, Inc. filed the instant Motion to Compel
Arbitration and Stay Action Pending Arbitration on June 12, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
The Motion is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281, et seq., which provides in relevant part: 
 
On petition of a party to an
arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to
arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such
controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate
the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy
exists, unless it determines that:
 
(a) The right to compel arbitration has
been waived by the petitioner; or 
(b) Grounds exist for the revocation of
the agreement.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2, subds. (a)-(b).) Defendant Ava,
Inc. has not demonstrated the existence of an arbitration agreement between the
parties. The Motion attaches a copy of a construction agreement and arbitration
provision between Defendant Ava, Inc. and Brian Cochran. (Motion, Kalashyan
Decl., Exhs. A-B.) Plaintiff is not a named party to the construction agreement
and arbitration provision. 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Defendant Ava. Inc. dba
Reliable Roofing and Retro-Fit’s Motion to Compel Arbitration is DENIED. 
 
DEFENDANT AVA, INC. DBA RELIABLE
ROOFING AND RETRO-FIT IS TO FILE AND SERVE A RESPONSE TO THE FIRST AMENDED
COMPLAINT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
