  Case Number:  23STCP04310    Hearing Date:   August 15, 2024    Dept:  26  Garza, et al. v. Holder, et al.MOTION
FOR RECONSIDERATION(CCP § 1008, et seq.)
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Respondents Lisa
Holder, Esq. and Law Offices of Lisa Holder’s Motion for Reconsideration is
DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
On November 27, 2023, Petitioners Daniel Garza and Angela
Dejesus (“Petitioners”) filed the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award
against Respondents Lisa Holder, Esq. and Law Offices of Lisa Holder
(“Respondents”). Following the initial hearing on April 22, 2024, the Court
continued the matter to allow for service of the papers on Respondent Law
Offices of Lisa Holder. (Minute Order, 04/22/24.) At the next hearing on June
24, 2024, the Court found service on Respondents had been completed and granted
the Petition in favor of Petitioners. (Minute Order, 06/24/24.)
 
Respondents filed the instant Motion for Reconsideration on July
3, 2024. Petitioners filed a response on July 26, 2024. 
 
Discussion
 
The Motion
is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a),
which states in relevant part:
 
When an application for an order has been made to a judge, or
to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted
conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days
after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based
upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the
same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify,
amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd.
(a).) The Court lacks the jurisdiction to reconsider a prior ruling, on motion
of a party, where the motion does not comply with the requirements of Code of
Civil Procedure section 1008. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (e); Le
Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1106.) Additionally, there is a
diligence requirement: “Courts have construed section 1008 to require a party
filing an application for reconsideration or a renewed application to show
diligence with a satisfactory explanation for not having presented the new or
different information earlier.” (Even Zohar Construction & Remodeling,
Inc. v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 830, 839.)
 
The Motion was timely filed and
served on July 3, 2024, nine days after service of the ruling on the Petition. Respondents
bring the Motion for Reconsideration on the grounds that they were
unaware the Court would consider the merits of the Petition at the hearing on
June 24, 2024 and were under the mistaken impression that the Court would only
consider the question of service. (Motion, Holder Decl., ¶¶22-26.) First, the
Motion does not demonstrate that Respondents acted with diligence. Respondents
did not appear at the hearing on June 24, 2024, the tentative ruling for which
the Court had posted online the afternoon earlier. Respondents, therefore, had
notice of the adverse ruling prior to the hearing yet either failed to either
check the tentative rulings or appear at the hearing at all. (Minute Order,
06/24/24.) Respondents’ misunderstanding regarding the time for filing a
response to the Petition should have been raised at that time. 
 
Second, even if
the Court were to find that Respondents acted with diligence and were to
consider their response to the Petition, the Court would come to the same
conclusion. The time for Respondents to challenge the arbitration award, whether by
response to the Petition or through their own petition to vacate the
arbitration award, has long since passed. Code of Civil Procedure section
1288.2 states in relevant part: “A response requesting that an award be vacated
or that an award be corrected shall be served and filed not later than
100 days after the date of service of a signed copy of the award….”
[emphasis added].) The award was served on July 14, 2022. (Pet., Attachment
6(c), p. 30.) The deadline for Respondents to challenge the award expired on
October 22, 2022. 
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore,
Respondents Lisa Holder, Esq. and Law Offices of Lisa Holder’s Motion for
Reconsideration is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
