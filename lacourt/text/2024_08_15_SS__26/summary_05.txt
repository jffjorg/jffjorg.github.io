And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Ava Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings. The motion was brought under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1281, et seq., which allows a party to a written arbitration agreement to seek arbitration and stay court proceedings. However, the judge found that Defendant Ava Inc. failed to demonstrate the existence of an arbitration agreement between the parties. Specifically, the agreement attached to the motion was between Defendant Ava Inc. and Brian Cochran, but Plaintiff Malaga Properties, LLC was not a party to the agreement. As a result, the judge denied the motion and ordered Defendant Ava Inc. to file and serve a response to the First Amended Complaint within 20 days.
