And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Veros Credit, LLC's Motion for Summary Judgment. The lawsuit was filed by Plaintiff Tashika L. Durisseau for breach of a vehicle lease agreement. The Defendant moved for summary judgment, arguing that there are no disputed facts showing liability for breach of the vehicle lease agreement. The Judge finds that the Defendant has carried its initial burden of proof and that the Plaintiff has failed to present evidence of a triable issue of material fact. The Judge concludes that the Defendant did not breach its obligations under the lease agreement and that the Plaintiff was not damaged as a result. The Defendant is ordered to file and serve a proposed judgment within 20 days of this order.
