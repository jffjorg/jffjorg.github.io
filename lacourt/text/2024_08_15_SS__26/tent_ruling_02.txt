Discussion
 
Allegations in the Complaint
 
The Complaint alleges a
single cause of action for breach of contract with respect to a motor vehicle
lease agreement. (Compl., ¶1.) The total purchase price was $36,900.00. (Ibid.)
Plaintiff paid off the full amount of $36,900.00 on February 24, 2023. (Id.
at ¶¶3, 9.) Defendant decided to commit fraud by adding $9,000.00 to the
contract price in order to resell the vehicle to gain a greater profit. (Ibid.)
Defendant did not provide Plaintiff with a copy of the lease agreement or the
proposed release agreement but promised that after she signed, Defendant would
correct the spelling of Plaintiff’s name and mail out the pink slip. (Id. at ¶11.) After Plaintiff read the contract and saw that it was a
trick to get her to pay an additional $9,000.00, she refused to sign the
illegal agreement and went home. (Ibid.) Based on these facts, Plaintiff
prays for general damages in an amount according to proof at trial, for
economic losses, and other damages. (Id. at p. 9.) 
 
Motion for Summary Judgment
 
A defendant seeking summary
judgment must show either (1)
that one or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established; or (2) that there is a complete
defense to that cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2).)
Plaintiff is under no evidentiary burden to produce rebuttal evidence until
Defendant meets its initial moving burden. (Binder v. Aetna Life Insurance
Company (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 839-840.) 
 
An action for breach of
contract must demonstrate the following elements: (1) the existence of the
contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the
defendant’s breach; and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff. (D’Arrigo
Bros. of California v. United Farmworkers of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th
790, 800.) Defendant moves for summary judgment on the grounds that there are
no disputed facts as to its lack of liability for breach of the vehicle lease
agreement.
 
In support of its Motion for Summary Judgment for the breach
of contract action, Plaintiff presents the following undisputed facts.
Plaintiff and Quantum Auto Sales, Inc. entered into a Retail Install Sales
Contract on February 28, 2017, for the purchase of a used 2013 Ford Explorer
(“the subject vehicle”). (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 1; Medrano
Decl., Exh. 1; Naples Decl., Exhs. A and F.) Plaintiff purchased the subject
vehicle on credit. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 2; Medrano Decl., ¶2.)
Plaintiff promised to repay the amount financed ($24,419.34), plus a finance
charge based on 22.99 annual interest, in the amount of $655.33 per month for
66 months. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 3; Medrano Decl., Exh. 1;
Naples Decl., Exhs. A and F.) The total amount owed by Plaintiff on the RISC
was $43,251.78. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 4; Medrano Decl., Exh. 1;
Naples Decl., Exhs. A and F.) Calculation of the payments and total amount due is
set forth in sections 1a and 1b of the RISC. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact
Nos. 5-6; Medrano Decl., ¶¶8-9 and Exh. 1 at §§ 1a-1b.) Defendant is the holder
of the RISC. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 9; Medrano Decl., Exh. 1;
Naples Decl., Exhs. A and F.) Plaintiff’s payment during the term of the RISC
was sporadic and inconsistent; Plaintiff also agreed to four separate extension
modifications, and two due date changes after asking Defendant for financial
hardship assistance. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 10-11; Medrano Decl.,
¶¶12-13 and Exhs. 3-9; Naples Decl., Exhs. A and F.) Ultimately, Plaintiff was
unable to perform her obligations under the RISC and has paid Defendant
$40,938.82. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact Nos. 12-13; Medrano Decl.,
¶¶12-14 and Exh. 3.) Due to Plaintiff’s default, the subject vehicle was
repossessed on August 1, 2023. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 15;
Medrano Decl., ¶¶11-16.) Plaintiff filed this action for breach of contract on
April 4, 2023. (Motion, Separate Statement, Fact No. 16; Naples Decl., ¶2.) The
Court granted Defendant’s discovery motions on February 8, 2024, and as a
result, Plaintiff has admitted all requests for admissions. (Motion, Separate
Statement, Fact Nos. 19-20; Naples Decl., ¶¶7-8 and Exh. F.) 
 
This evidence carries Defendant’s initial burden of proof in
that it demonstrates though undisputed facts that Defendant did not breach its
obligations under the RISC and Plaintiff was not damaged as a result of any
breach of the RISC by Defendant. The burden now shifts to Plaintiff to present
evidence that demonstrates the existence of a triable issue of material fact.
Plaintiff’s opposition, however, is not a model of clarity and attaches no
evidence. It appears to argue that Defendant’s evidence is objectionable
because defense counsel lacks standing to make arguments in support of the
Motion. Plaintiff is mistaken with respect to the nature of defense counsel’s
arguments, which are not made on their own behalf, but on behalf of their
client, Defendant. This is entirely proper.
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, Defendant Veros
Credit, LLC’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED. DEFENDANT IS TO FILE AND
SERVE A PROPOSED JUDGMENT WITHIN 10 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
