Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the demurrer filed by the Defendant, Lancer Insurance Company, to the Complaint filed by the Plaintiff, Movses Kostanyan. The Defendant demurred to the Complaint on the grounds that the Court has no jurisdiction over the subject of the cause of action, there is another action pending between the same parties, and the pleading is uncertain.

The Court finds that the Defendant's demurrer to the breach of contract cause of action is sustained with leave to amend granted. The Plaintiff's Complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for breach of contract.

The Court also finds that the Defendant's demurrer to the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing cause of action is sustained with leave to amend granted. The Plaintiff's Complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

The Court denies the Defendant's request for judicial notice of certain documents related to the Underinsured Motorist Claim (UIM claim).

The Court grants the Plaintiff leave to amend the Complaint to cure the defects found in this ruling.
