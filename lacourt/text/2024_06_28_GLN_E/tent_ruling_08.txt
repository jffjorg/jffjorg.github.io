RELIEF REQUESTED
“Defendant, STARBUCKS CORPORATION (“Starbucks Corporation”) will and hereby
does demur to the Complaint filed by Plaintiff, JOYCE WAHBA (“Plaintiff”)
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 430.10, et seq., as follows:
1.     
Plaintiff’s Fifth Cause of Action for Breach of Implied Warranty
of Fitness for a Particular Use
This
Demurrer shall be based upon this Notice, the attached Demurrer, the attached
Memorandum of Points and Authorities, Declaration of Mark I. Melo, Esq., and
Exhibits filed concurrently herewith, all files and documents filed in this
action with this Court, and upon such further oral and/or documentary evidence
and argument as may be properly presented to the Court at the time of the
Hearing on this matter.”
(Mot.
p. 1-2.)
PROCEDURAL
Meet
and Confer
A party filing a
demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who
filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining
whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)  “The parties shall meet and confer at least
five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. If the parties are
not able to meet and confer at least five days prior to the date the responsive
pleading is due, the demurring party shall be granted an automatic 30-day
extension of time within which to file a responsive pleading, by filing and
serving, on or before the date on which a demurrer would be due, a declaration
stating under penalty of perjury that a good faith attempt to meet and confer
was made and explaining the reasons why the parties could not meet and
confer.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41,
subd. (a)(2).) Failure to sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to
overrule or sustain a demurrer. (Id., § 430.41(a)(4).)
Here,
Defendant’s counsel alleges that a meet and confer occurred, but the parties were
unable to resolve the dispute. (Melo Decl. ¶ 3.)
LEGAL STANDARDS FOR DEMURRERS
Demurrer
– Sufficiency
A demurrer for
sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn v. Mirda, (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747.)  When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context.  (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of
Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)  The court “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law ….”  (Berkley
v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) 
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of
the pleading or via proper judicial notice. 
(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.)  A demurrer tests the pleadings
alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it lies only
where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially
noticed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30,
430.70.)  The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147
Cal.App.4th at 747.)  
The
general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts, not
evidentiary facts.  (Doe v. City of
Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) “All that is required of a
plaintiff, as a matter of pleading … is that his complaint set forth the
essential facts of the case with reasonable precision and with sufficient
particularity to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source and extent of
his cause of action.” (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp. (1945) 26
Cal.2d 149, 156-157.)  
On
demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to “determine whether or not
the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any
legal theory.” (Das v. Bank of America, N.A. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727,
734.)  Demurrers do not lie as to only
parts of causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose
of an entire cause of action to be sustained.” 
(Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97,
119.)  “Generally
it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if
there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.”  (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)

Demurrer – Uncertainty
A special demurrer for uncertainty, CCP section 430.10(f), is disfavored
and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot
reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what issues must be
admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against
him/her.  (Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)  Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat vague,
“ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff, Joyce Wahba, filed
the instant Complaint on 3/18/2024. The Complaint alleges five causes of
action: (1) Negligence, (2) Strict Products Liability, (3) Negligence – Product
Liability, (4) Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability, and (5) Breach of
Implied Warranty of Fitness for a Particular Use.
The
instant action arises from allegations wherein Plaintiff and her fiancé ordered
beverages from Starbucks. (See Compl. ¶ 8.) Plaintiff alleges that she was the
passenger of the vehicle and her fiancé was the driver. (Id.) Plaintiff
alleges that when she went to take a sip from the black coffee, the unsecured
lid popped off and the scalding hot coffee spilled all over her abdomen,
genital region, and thighs, causing her severe burns and permanent injuries. (Id.)
Movant
only demurs to the fifth cause of action for breach of implied warranty of
fitness for a particular use.
Fifth Cause of Action – Breach of Implied
Warranty of Fitness for a Particular Use
Here,
Defendant first cites to CACI No. 1232 to show what the elements are for the
instant cause of action. Those elements according to CACI 1232 are:
1. That Plaintiff bought the product from
Starbucks Corporation;
2. That, at the time of purchase, Starbucks
Corporation, knew or had reason to know that Plaintiff intended to use the
product for a particular purpose;
3. That, at the time of purchase, Starbucks
Corporation knew or had reason to know that Plaintiff was relying on its skill
and judgment to select or furnish a product that was suitable for the particular
purpose
4. That Plaintiff justifiably relied on Starbucks
Corporation’s skill and judgment;
5. That the product was not suitable for
the particular purpose;
6. That Plaintiff took reasonable steps to
notify Starbucks Corporation within a reasonable time that the product was not suitable;
7. That Plaintiff was harmed; and
8. That the failure of the product to be
suitable was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s harm.
(See CACI 1232.)
Defendant does not point to a particular number/element
with respect to 1-8 in the CACI instructions to argue that one of the
numbers/elements were not alleged.
Instead, Defendant makes the following arguments.
The first argument that Defendant makes is that Plaintiff
never alleges that she was burned from actually consuming or drinking the
subject coffee itself. As to this argument, the Court does not find it
availing. Defendant provides no legal authority for this argument and that the
Plaintiff has to allege that.
The second argument Defendant makes is that Plaintiff
never alleged that the subject coffee itself was unfit for consumption. This
argument is also unavailing. Plaintiff alleged, “The coffee delivered to JOYCE
by Defendants STARBUCKS and DOES 51-100 was not fit for the particular purpose,
which was consumption.” (Compl. ¶ 50.)
The third argument that Defendant makes is that the
“particular purpose” alleged by Plaintiff constitutes only an “ordinary” or
“general” purpose of the subject product, thereby rendering this cause of
action redundant of the fourth cause of action.
Defendant’s argument is somewhat difficult to decipher
here.
Defendant cites to Footnote 2 in American Suzuki
Motor Corp. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1291 which states:
The complaint here also alleged a breach
of the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose under section
2315, and a Song–Beverly Act claim.
Under section 2315, an implied
warranty of fitness for a particular purpose exists where the seller at the
time of contracting has reason to know (a) any particular purpose for which
goods are required, and (b) that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or
judgment to select or to furnish suitable goods for such purpose. “A
‘particular purpose’ differs from the ordinary purpose for which the goods are
used in that it envisages a specific use by the buyer which is peculiar to the
nature of his business whereas the ordinary purposes for which goods are used are
those envisaged in the concept of merchantability and go to uses which are
customarily made of the goods in question.” (See code com., 23A West's
Ann.Cal.U.Com.Code (1964 ed.) p. 289.) Because real parties have failed to
identify any legally cognizable “particular purpose” for which they supposedly
obtained their vehicles (other than the general purpose of providing
transportation), no implied warranty of fitness claim against Suzuki has
been stated.
The Song–Beverly Act incorporates the
provisions of sections 2314 and 2315. It “supplements, rather
than supersedes, the provisions of the California Uniform Commercial Code” by
broadening a consumer's remedies to include costs, attorney's fees, and civil
penalties. (Krieger v. Nick Alexander Imports, Inc. (1991)
234 Cal.App.3d 205, 213, 285 Cal.Rptr. 717.)
(American Suzuki Motor
Corp. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1291, 1295, fn. 2.)
Defendant also cites to a
non-binding federal case [Hilsley v. General Mills, Inc. (S.D. Cal.
2019) 376 F.Supp.3d 1043, 1050] wherein the U.S. District Court ruled
that Plaintiff did not allege a breach of the implied warranty of fitness for a
particular purpose.
In explaining its ruling,
the court in Hilsley stated:
An implied warranty of fitness for a particular
purpose exists “[w]here the seller at the time of contracting has reason to
know any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the buyer
is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable
goods ....” Cal. Com. Code § 2315.
A ‘particular purpose’ differs from the
ordinary purpose for which the goods are used in that it envisages a specific
use by the buyer which is peculiar to the nature of his business whereas the
ordinary purposes for which goods are used are those envisaged in the concept
of merchantability and go to uses which are customarily made of the goods in
question.
Am. Suzuki Motor Corp. v. Super. Ct. (Carney), 37 Cal. App.
4th 1291, 1295 n.2, 44 Cal.Rptr.2d 526 (1995).
Plaintiff alleges she purchased the fruit
flavored snacks “multiple times ... for personal and household consumption” in
reliance on the representation that they did not contain artificial flavors.
(Compl. ¶¶ 44, 99-103, 179-184.) The alleged “particular purpose” is “as a naturally-flavored
food product.” (Id. ¶ 179.) This stated purpose is not “peculiar
to” Plaintiff's use as distinguished from the “ordinary use” of food
products. See Am. Suzuki Motor, 37 Cal.
App. 4th at 1295 n.2, 44 Cal.Rptr.2d 526.
(Hilsley v. General
Mills, Inc. (S.D. Cal. 2019) 376 F.Supp.3d 1043, 1050.)
It appears to be that
Defendant’s argument is that the alleged “particular purpose” of consumption
cannot qualify as a particular purpose for this cause of action. As to this,
the Court will hear argument. 
What the law actually
requires at the pleading stage for what can qualify as a “particular purpose”
is difficult to determine for several reasons. 
First, when footnote 2 in
American Suzuki defined “particular purpose,” the court in that matter did
not appear to cite binding authority for its definition. It cited  “See code com., 23A West's Ann.Cal.U.Com.Code
(1964 ed.) p. 289” after giving the definition of “particular purpose.”
Second, footnote 2 in American
Suzuki cited Krieger; Krieger did not address the definition
of “particular purpose.”
Third, the federal case
is not binding authority.
Fourth, Plaintiff’s
Opposition does not assist the Court with respect to analyzing American
Suzuki. Plaintiff argues as follows:
The issue framed by the court in American
Suzuki was whether the plaintiffs in a class action could state a cause of
action for breach of implied warranty where “they have suffered no personal
injury or property damage from a vehicle they claim is defectively designed,
and it is impliedly conceded that their vehicles have—since the date of
purchase—remained fit for their ordinary purpose [.]” (American Suzuki
at 1293.)
(Pl. Oppo. p. 3-4.)
Plaintiff ignores that
Footnote 2 in American Suzuki seemed to be at least partially on point. 
Fifth, the Reply cites
another case, Mills v. Forestex Co. (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 625, that the
following footnote:
“Under section 2315 [of the
California Uniform Commercial Code], an implied warranty of fitness for a
particular purpose exists where the seller at the time of contracting has
reason to know (a) any particular purpose for which goods are required, and (b)
that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select or to
furnish suitable goods for such purpose. ‘A “particular purpose” differs from
the ordinary purpose for which the goods are used in that it envisages a
specific use by the buyer which is peculiar to the nature of his business
whereas the ordinary purposes for which goods are used are those envisaged in
the concept of merchantability and go to uses which are customarily made of the
goods in question.’ [Citation.]” (American Suzuki Motor Corp. v.
Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1291, 1295, fn. 2, 44
Cal.Rptr.2d 526.)
(Mills v. Forestex Co.
(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 625, 635, fn. 4.)
Therefore, while to this Court it does not appear that
coffee consumption would fall under the definition of “particular purpose”
under American Suzuki, the problem is that American Suzuki did
not cite to any authority other than “See code com., 23A West's
Ann.Cal.U.Com.Code (1964 ed.) p. 289.)” for its authority defining the term
“particular purpose.”
Lastly, Defendant’s argument that the fifth cause of
action (breach of warranty of fitness for particular purpose) and the fourth
cause of action (breach of implied warranty of merchantability) being
duplicative seems to miss the mark. It appears from case law that the implied
warranty of merchantability is set forth in Cal. Commercial Code § 2314 and
that the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose is set forth in
Cal. Commercial Code § 2315. (See American Suzuki Motor Corp. v. Superior
Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1291, 1295) Therefore, not only do there appear
to be different statutory sections for each cause of action, but case law seems
to indicate that the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose has
its own elements required to allege a cause of action. (See Keith v.
Buchanan (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 13, 25 citing Metowski v. Traid Corp.
(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 332, 341.) 
TENTATIVE RULING FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
The
Court will hear argument based on the previously explained reasoning.
To be fully transparent, the fifth cause of action
here does seem like somewhat of a head-scratcher, in that the issue here is
whether a cup of coffee was too hot and/or improperly sealed.  The customer was going to drink coffee,
presumably, and not do anything particularly peculiar with it—again, unless the
Court is missing some wrinkle here.
Unless there are circumstances or allegations that the
Court is missing, it simply seems to be the case that this is a situation that
does not support a claim for Breach of Implied Warranty of Fitness for a
Particular Use alleged in the fifth cause of action.
That said, the Court will hear argument.
