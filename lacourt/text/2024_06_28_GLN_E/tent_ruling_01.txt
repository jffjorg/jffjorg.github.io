BACKGROUND
The
instant motion pertains to the Plaintiff’s request for attorneys’ fees based on
being the prevailing party in a Song-Beverly action after settling the dispute
with Defendant.
 
DISCUSSION
Civil Code 1794(d)
Under
Civil Code § 1794, subdivision (d) the prevailing party in an action that
arises out of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act is entitled to fees that
were reasonably incurred:  “If the buyer prevails under this section, the
buyer shall be allowed by the Court to recover as part of the judgment a sum
equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney's fees
based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably
incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of
such action.” (Civ. Code, § 1794(d).)  
Here,
there was no dispute as to Plaintiff being the prevailing party due to the
settlement of the case.
Timeliness
of Motion
The
Opposition argues that Plaintiff presented the instant fee motion 205 days
after the settlement of the case. Opposition argues that this motion is
untimely under CRC, Rule 3.1702.
“A notice of motion to claim attorney's fees for
services up to and including the rendition of judgment in the trial
court-including attorney's fees on an appeal before the rendition of judgment
in the trial court-must be served and filed within the time for filing a notice
of appeal under rules 8.104 and 8.108 in an unlimited civil case[.]” (CRC, Rule
3.1702(b)(1).)
Further, “Unless a
statute or rules 8.108, 8.702, or 8.712 provides otherwise, a notice of appeal
must be filed on or before the earliest of: (A)  60 days after the
superior court clerk serves on the party filing the notice of appeal a document
entitled "Notice of Entry" of judgment or a filed-endorsed copy of
the judgment, showing the date either was served; (B) 60 days after the party
filing the notice of appeal serves or is served by a party with a document
entitled "Notice of Entry" of judgment or a filed-endorsed copy of
the judgment, accompanied by proof of service; or (C)  180 days after
entry of judgment.” (CRC, rule 8.104(a)(1).)
Defendant asserts that
there is a “catch-22” here because for matters where the dismissal of the
complaint with prejudice would only be filed after an award of attorney fees,
there can be no untimely fee motion because the fee motion itself is a
condition precedent to the trigger point of any deadline.
Defendant argues that the
drafters of rule 3.1702 could not have intended that one class of matters would
have a time limit to file fee motions simply due to their status of possessing
a “final judgment,” while other classes of matters could linger on a docket in
perpetuity.
Defendant thus argues
that when the parties settled the case at mediation on October 17, 2023, this
settlement thus acted as a “judgment” under 3.1702, and the time limits to file
this motion started to run on October 17, 2023.
Defendant argues the
filing of this motion on 5/9/2024, which is allegedly 205 days after the
mediation, is nowhere close to meeting the 180-day deadline.
The Reply points out that
the plain language of Rule 3.1702(b)(1) and 8.104(a) explicitly refers to
“judgment,” and that no judgment was ever entered here for any deadline to take
effect.
The Court will hear
argument. 
The Court is inclined to
reject Defendant’s argument. As the Reply pointed out, all the cases cited by
Opposition to support its argument are either inapposite or not on-point. 
Further, the supplemental
declaration in Reply points to Exhibit 7 which is the settlement agreement. Plaintiff
points to the language on page 3 in Exhibit 7  of the Supplemental Jiang Declaration that
states, “Once the issue of outstanding attorneys’ fees and costs is resolved by
way of settlement or court order, plaintiffs shall file a Request for Dismissal
with prejudice of the entire lawsuit as against all defendant forthwith.” Plaintiff
argues that denying this motion as untimely would be reneging from the
obligations of the settlement agreement.
Since Defendant did not
provide legal authority that is directly on-point to support the assertion that
this motion should be denied on grounds of untimeliness, the Court is inclined to
find this motion timely.
General Legal Standard - Lodestar and
Multiplier 
The determination of reasonable amount of attorney fees is
within the sound discretion of trial courts. (PLCM Group v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095; Akins v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000)
79 Cal. App. 4th 1127, 1134.) “The determination of what constitutes a
reasonable fee generally ‘begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate….’” “[T]he
lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the community; it
may be adjusted by the court based on factors including, as relevant herein,
(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill
displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award….” (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) 
 
In setting the
hourly rate for an attorney fees award, courts are entitled to consider the
rate of “‘fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community
for similar work.’” (Bihun v. AT&T Information Systems, Inc. (1993)
13 Cal. App. 4th 976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other
grounds by Lakin v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 644,
664.) The burden is on the party seeking attorney fees to prove reasonableness
of the fees. (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino
(2010) 188 Cal. App. 4th 603, 615.) 
 
The Court has
broad discretion in determining the amount of a reasonable attorney's fee award
which will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a
prejudicial error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial
evidence.” (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal. App. 4th
1379, 1393-94.) The Court need not explain its calculation of the amount of
attorney’s fees awarded in detail; identifying the factors considered in
arriving at the amount will suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Industries Inc.
(2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-75.)
 
ANALYSIS
Reasonableness of Hourly Rate and Time Expended
Plaintiff requests $38,621.50 in attorney’s fees plus an additional $5,000
for Plaintiff’s counsel to review Defendant’s Opposition, draft the Reply
brief, and attend the hearing on this Motion.
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel states its hourly rates as follows:
 
The hourly
rates for the attorneys who worked on this case is Nancy Zhang ($500-
$510/hour) and Corinna Jiang ($415-430/hour). These rates are appropriate given
the attorneys’ relative experience and qualifications. (See Jiang Decl., ¶¶
32-35.) The rates are similar to the rates of Los Angeles County awarded to
attorneys in other Song-Beverly cases. (Id., ¶¶ 27-30, Exhs. 1- 4.)
 
(Pl. Mot. p.8.)
 
Plaintiff also argues that its
request for 97.85 hours spent is reasonable. 
 
To support Plaintiff’s
reasonableness of its request, Plaintiff submitted the Jiang Declaration.
 
Defendant argues that 97.85 hours
of work is excessive and unsubstantiated and that 83.25 hours should be
subtracted. Defendant also argues that Plaintiff should recover no more than
$11,002.50 in fees. Defendant attacks several of Plaintiff’s time entries on
pages 7-10 of the Opposition. Defendant also argues that the rate of
Plaintiff’s counsel is not reasonable. 
 
The Court will hear argument.
 
Multiplier
The
lodestar amount “may be adjusted by the court based on factors including (1)
the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed
in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation
precluded other employment by the attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of
the fee award.”¿ (Bernardi¿v. County of Monterey¿(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th
1379, 1399 [citing Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132].)¿ The
purpose of any lodestar and the increase thereto “is intended to approximate
market-level compensation for such services” and is entirely discretionary.¿
(Id.)¿ “The purpose of a fee enhancement is not to reward attorneys for
litigating certain kinds of cases, but to fix a reasonable fee in a particular
action.”¿ (Weeks v. Baker & McKenzie¿(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1171-72.)
 
“The trial court is neither foreclosed from, nor
required to, award a multiplier.” (Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of North America, LLC
(2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240, 247 citing Montgomery v. Bio-Med Specialties,
Inc. (1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 1292, 1297.)
Here, Plaintiff does not request a multiplier.
The Court will not apply a multiplier.
Costs
Plaintiff
also filed and served a memorandum of costs on Defendant on 5/9/2024, which is
the same date that Plaintiff filed its motion for attorneys’ fees.
The Court notes that Plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’
fees does not request costs. 
While the Court has some notice concerns about
granting costs because the motion for attorneys’ fees didn’t reference costs, the
Opposition does not address this issue. In fact, the Opposition argues that the
$2,321.72 that the memorandum of costs seeks should be reduced by $1,471.24.
Opposition argues that :
• GM should not be required to reimburse
Counsel for $623.67 for costs associated with Plaintiff’s motions to compel.
(See Memorandum of Costs; Worksheet, p. 1 and Attachments 14 & 16). These
were optional costs that Counsel elected, where the motions practice was
entirely one-sided. These unnecessary costs should be stricken in their
entirety. 
• GM should not be forced to reimburse
Counsel $150.00 for “Jury Fees” (jury deposit). (See Memorandum of Costs,
Worksheet, p. 1.) This case never went to trial and GM should therefore not be
billed for the $150 jury deposit. The Court should strike this cost.
• GM should not be required to pay $697.57
in “TBD” costs related to Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney Fees. (Id.,
Worksheet, p. 1 and Attachments 14 and 16.) The Court should strike these
costs. Costs are only allowed if actually incurred; Counsel has not spent
anything for future services. Moreover, $697.57 appears to be an estimate, not
an actual charge incurred.
(Def. Oppo. p. 12-13.)
Plaintiff’s Reply cites
to CRC, Rule 3.1700.
“Any notice of motion to
strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the
cost memorandum. If the cost memorandum was served by mail, the period is
extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1013. If the cost memorandum
was served electronically, the period is extended as provided in Code of Civil
Procedure section 1010.6(a)(4).” (CRC, Rule 3.1700(b)(1).)
Plaintiff points out how Defendant
did not file a motion to tax costs. Plaintiff argues that any argument
submitted about costs should be disregarded because a motion to tax costs was
not filed.
The Court agrees that
there was no motion to tax costs submitted. Further, the Court notes that even
if it construes Defendant’s Opposition to the motion for attorneys’ fees as a
motion to tax costs, the Opposition was not served and filed within 15 days
after service of the cost memorandum. The Opposition was filed/served on
6/14/2024, and the memorandum of costs was filed/served on 5/9/2024.
The Court will hear
argument.
TENTATIVE RULING
The
Court is inclined to grant the motion, but will hear from the parties regarding
the appropriate amount to be awarded in fees and costs.
