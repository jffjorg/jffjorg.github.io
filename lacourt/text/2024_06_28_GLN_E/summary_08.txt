```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by the defendant, Starbucks Corporation, to the fifth cause of action in the plaintiff's complaint. The fifth cause of action alleges that Starbucks breached the implied warranty of fitness for a particular use by selling coffee that was too hot and improperly sealed. The judge notes that the issue is whether the plaintiff's alleged use of the coffee - i.e., drinking it - constitutes a "particular purpose" for the implied warranty of fitness for a particular use. The judge is skeptical of the plaintiff's claim, citing a lack of clarity in the definition of "particular purpose" and a lack of authority to support the claim. The judge will hear argument on the issue before making a final decision.
