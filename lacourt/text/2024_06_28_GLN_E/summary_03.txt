Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is tentatively planning to deny the motion to set aside the dismissal of the Complaint filed by MONEYTUN, LLC. The motion is based on the argument that the dismissal was caused by the mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect of Plaintiff's counsel. However, the judge has identified several service issues with the motion, including the lack of proof of service and the failure to file the proof of service with the motion. The judge is also concerned that the motion is not in proper form, as it does not specify which pleading or document should be filed with the motion. The judge is giving Plaintiff the opportunity to cure these service issues and to address the issues with the motion before making a final ruling.
