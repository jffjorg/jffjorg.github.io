And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants plaintiff Dalia Formica's motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The proposed amendment adds a cause of action for Elder Abuse/Neglect against all defendants. The judge finds that plaintiff has shown good cause for the amendment and that the new cause of action arises out of the events alleged in the original complaint. The judge notes that the trial is currently set for February 2025 and that defendants will have sufficient time to conduct discovery and pursue any dispositive motions in regard to the new cause of action. The judge also finds that plaintiff's expert consultation and discovery have provided sufficient basis for the new cause of action. The judge orders plaintiff to file the First Amended Complaint within 10 days of the Court's order.
