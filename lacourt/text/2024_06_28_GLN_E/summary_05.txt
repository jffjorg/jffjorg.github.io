**Significant Statements**

* "The Court fails to understand why Defendant is arguing that the third cause of action is a contract dispute."
* "Plaintiffs did not allege how, if at all, Defendant failed to properly store the vehicle, or prepare the vehicle, or repair the vehicle."
* "The Court notes that although both Deyo and Sexton dealt with older versions of the instant statute and the statutes in Deyo and Sexton were repealed, it appears that those cases stand for the proposition that motions to compel further responses must be timely filed."
* "The Court does not find this argument availing."
* "The Court fails to see how Defendant not making its 45-day timeliness argument at the case management conference is legally relevant."
