And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff RODNEY HENDERSON's unopposed motion for trial preference without prejudice. The Plaintiff, who is 78 years old and suffers from various health issues, filed the motion under CCP §36(a), which allows for trial preference for parties over 70 years old who have a substantial interest in the action and whose health is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing their interest in the litigation. However, the judge found that the Plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to support the need for a preference, as the Plaintiff's declaration did not indicate that his health is at risk of worsening before the case comes to trial.
