And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court is addressing a motion to compel the deposition of Elliot Zemel, a witness for the defendant, and to produce certain documents. The plaintiff, Dianah Middleton, filed a complaint against the defendant, South Pasadena Care Center, LLC, alleging elder abuse and negligence. The defendant failed to appear for a deposition and has filed boilerplate objections to the requests for production of documents. The court finds that the defendant's objections are legally inadequate and that the defendant must produce the requested documents. The court also grants the plaintiff's request for sanctions, ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiff $1,710 in attorney fees.
