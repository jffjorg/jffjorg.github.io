Middleton v. South Pasadena Care Center, LLC, et al.
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Deposition of Defendant South Pasadena Care Center LLC’s Person Most Qualified
and Request for Monetary Sanctions
 
BACKGROUND 
            On
November 29, 2023, Plaintiff Dianah Middleton, by and through her guardian ad
litem Leslie Middleton (Plaintiff), filed a complaint against Defendant South
Pasadena Care Center, LLC (Defendant) and Yehuda Schmukler.
            The
complaint alleges the following causes of action: elder abuse and negligence.
            On
February 27, 2024, Plaintiff served Defendant with a notice of deposition of
Defendant’s person most knowledgeable (PMK). The deposition was set for March
12, 2024.
            Defendant’s
PMK did not appear for the deposition. 
            On
March 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel the deposition of
Defendant’s PMK and production of documents.
LEGAL STANDARD
            “The
service of a deposition notice . . . is effective to require any deponent who
is a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee
of a party to attend and to testify, as well as produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and
copying.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280, subd. (a).) “If, after service of a
deposition notice, a party to the action . . . without having served a valid
objection . . . fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, the
party giving notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance
and testimony, and the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (a).) 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff seeks to compel the
deposition of Defendant’s PMK and production of documents. In opposition,
Defendant argues Plaintiff failed to sufficiently meet and confer. However,
Plaintiff has inquired about Defendant’s PMK’s failure to appear for the
deposition. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(2).) The court further
notes that Defendant has offered dates of availability for the deposition.
Moreover, Defendant has not objected to the topics of inquiry. Accordingly, the
court will address whether Defendant’s objections to the requests for
production of documents are valid.[1]
            Request
No. 1
            This request seeks any documents in
the custody, control, or possession of Defendant pertaining to Plaintiff.
Defendant has agreed to produce responsive documents.
            Request

            This request seeks the facility and
staffing information during Plaintiff’s residency. Defendant has agreed to

journal submissions by Defendant to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services prepared by the facility during Plaintiff’s residency at the facility.

responsive documents.
            Request

non-privileged, responsive documents.
            Request
No. 6
            Defendant has agreed to produce
non-privileged documents that are responsive to this request.
            Request
No. 7 
            This request seeks all facility RUGS
and HIPPS codes for each resident of the facility during the time of
Plaintiff’s residency. Defendant objects that this request targets confidential
medical information of third-parties. (Bugarin v. Chartone, Inc. (2006)
135 Cal.App.4th 1558, 1561-1562.) However, this request specifies that the
third-parties’ names and identifying information should be redacted. Thus,
Defendant shall produce responsive documents.
            Request
No. 8 
            This request seeks all documents
reflecting documentation of the number of admitted residents in the facility
that suffered from pressure sores, falls, infections, excessive weight loss,
and incontinence. Defendant objects that Evidence Code section 1157 protects
these records. Evidence Code section 1157 gives a blanket exclusion from
discovery to records of committees of hospital medical staffs concerned with
evaluation and improvement of the quality of care in the hospital. (Roseville
Community Hospital v. Superior Court (1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 809, 813.)
Defendant prepares the data at issue for quality assurance meetings. Moreover,
the data permits Defendant’s medical staff to determine whether patients’ needs
are met at the facility. Thus, Defendant need not produce documents responsive
to this request.
            Request
No. 9
            This request seeks the facility’s
unusual occurrence logs or 24-hour communication log-books as they pertain to
facility operations during Plaintiff’s residency. Defendant objects that this
request targets confidential medical information of third-parties. (Bugarin
v. Chartone, Inc. (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1558, 1561-1562.) However, this
request specifies that the third-parties’ names and identifying information
should be redacted. In addition, Defendant objects that Evidence Code section
1157 protects these records. Evidence Code section 1157 gives a blanket
exclusion from discovery to records of committees of hospital medical staffs
concerned with evaluation and improvement of the quality of care in the
hospital. (Roseville Community Hospital v. Superior Court (1977) 70
Cal.App.3d 809, 813.) But Defendant does not clarify whether these documents were
prepared for quality assurance discussions. Nor does Defendant demonstrate that
a medical staff committee used the information for the evaluation and
improvement of quality of care. Thus, Defendant shall produce responsive
documents. 
            Request

who provided services to facility residents during Plaintiff’s residency.

third-parties’ names and identifying information should be redacted. Defendant
shall produce responsive documents.

which Defendant relied to ensure personnel were fit to perform their job duties

this request targets confidential medical information of third-parties. (Bugarin
v. Chartone, Inc. (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1558, 1561-1562.) However, this
request specifies that the third-parties’ names and identifying information
should be redacted. In addition, Defendant objects that Evidence Code section
1157 protects these records. Evidence Code section 1157 gives a blanket
exclusion from discovery to records of committees of hospital medical staffs
concerned with evaluation and improvement of the quality of care in the
hospital. (Roseville Community Hospital v. Superior Court (1977) 70
Cal.App.3d 809, 813.) But Defendant does not clarify whether these documents

that a medical staff committee used the information for the evaluation and

            This
request seeks all documents pertaining to statements or complaints about

medical information of third-parties. (Bugarin v. Chartone, Inc. (2006)
135 Cal.App.4th 1558, 1561-1562.) However, this request specifies that the
third-parties’ names and identifying information should be redacted. In
addition, Defendant objects that Evidence Code section 1157 protects these
records. Evidence Code section 1157 gives a blanket exclusion from discovery to
records of committees of hospital medical staffs concerned with evaluation and

Hospital v. Superior Court (1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 809, 813.) But Defendant
does not clarify whether these documents were prepared for quality assurance
discussions. Nor does Defendant demonstrate that a medical staff committee used
the information for the evaluation and improvement of quality of care. Thus,
Defendant shall produce responsive documents. 
            Request
No. 20
            This request seeks all documents
consisting of exit interview for employees from January 1, 2022 to October 5,
2023. Defendant objects that this request targets confidential information of
third-parties. However, this request specifies that the third-parties’ names
and identifying information should be redacted. In addition, Defendant objects
that Evidence Code section 1157 protects these records. Evidence Code section

documents responsive to this request.
            Request
No. 22

documents responsive to this request.
            Request
No. 23
            This request seeks documents
referencing facility staffing levels, census levels, budget, and compliance
with applicable laws or regulations during Plaintiff’s residency. Defendant
objects that Civil Code section 3295 protects information about Defendant’s
operating budget. As Defendant notes, though, its financial status is
discoverable where the information goes to the heart of the cause of action. (GT,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 748, 754.) In the complaint,
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant’s misconduct resulted from its financial
policies, practices, and limitations. (Complaint, ¶ 7.) Thus, Defendant shall
produce responsive documents.
            Request
No. 24
            Defendant has agreed to produce
documents responsive to this request.
            Request
No. 25
            Defendant has agreed to produce

            Request

            Defendant has agreed to produce
documents responsive to this request.
            Sanctions
            Plaintiff seeks sanctions under Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (g).) Because some of
Defendant’s objections to the requests for production had merit, the court
finds that sanctions are not warranted.
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion is moot as to Defendant’s
person most knowledgeable appearance at deposition, the topics of inquiry, and
Request for Production Nos. 1-6, 10-12, 14, 16-18, 21, 22, 24-26. The court
grants Plaintiff’s motion as to Request for Production Nos. 7, 9, 13, 15, 19,
20, 23. The court denies Plaintiff’s motion as to Request for Production No. 8.
            Plaintiff
shall give notice.
