 Case No.:  19STCV23908 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  April 9, 2024



 
Plaintiff Hole in One Productions
(Yellow Birds), LLC’s motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement against
Defendants is denied without prejudice.  
 
          Plaintiff Hole in
One Productions (Yellow Birds), LLC (“HIOP”) (“Plaintiff”) moves for an order
enforcing the settlement agreement against Defendants.  (Notice of Motion, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §664.6.)
 
          Background
          On July 10, 2019,
Plaintiff filed its complaint against Defendants Mark Canton (“Canton”),
Courtney Solomon (“Solomon”), YB Productions LLC (“YB”), Cinelou Films, LLC
(“Cinelou”), and Mad Riot Entertainment, LLC (“Mad Riot”)[1]
(collectively, “Defendants”).  On
February 13, 2020, Plaintiff filed the operative first amended complaint
(“FAC”) against Defendant alleging six causes of action: (1) breach of
agreement; (2) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (3) negligent
misrepresentation; (4) fraud-intentional misrepresentation; (5) violation of
Corporations Code §§25400, 25401; and (6) violation of Corporations Code
§§25504, et seq.
On or about April 29, 2021, Defendants filed Notice of Settlement
of an unconditional settlement.  (4/29/21
Notice of Settlement.)  On or about May
13, 2021, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement of a conditional
settlement.  (5/13/21 Notice of
Settlement.)  On November 16, 2021,
Plaintiff’s counsel filed a declaration attaching a fully executed Settlement
Agreement between the parties, which was executed on November 12, 2021.  (Decl. of Rosenthal ¶3, Exh. A.)  On November 19, 2021, this Court, pursuant to
an oral request made by Plaintiff, ordered this matter dismissed without
prejudice, retaining jurisdiction pursuant to C.C.P. §664.6.  (11/19/21 Minute Order.)
Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Defendants were
to “offer two acting roles (each a “Role” and collectively “Roles”) which
meet the requirements of subsection c.v.” to Renee Willett, Plaintiff’s
designee, which required that the Roles have a proper noun name (i.e. “Jill” or
“Samantha”, not “waitress” or “receptionist”) and each Role had to have at
least ten (10) lines of dialogue with Willet’s Role being readily identifiable.  (Decl. of Willett ¶¶2-4,
Exh. A at §§2.c.ii, 2.c.v.)
Plaintiff filed the instant motion on March 15, 2024.  Defendants Solomon and Cinelou filed an
opposition on March 26, 2024.  Defendant
Canton filed his joinder to the opposition on March 26, 2024.  Plaintiff filed its reply on April 2, 2024.
Defendants Solomon and Cinelou oppose consideration of the motion
as untimely under C.C.P. §1005(b) on the grounds that the instant motion was
served on them on March 15, 2024, by mail and email, which required an
additional two days added to the requisite service and filing of the moving
papers period of 16 court days.  (C.C.P.
§1005(b).)  For appropriate service by
email, Plaintiff’s moving papers should have been filed by March 13, 2024.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion was untimely
served and is therefore denied.
 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing,
Plaintiff’s motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement is denied without
prejudice.  
Moving Party to give notice.
