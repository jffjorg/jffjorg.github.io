- "Because there is but one complaint in a civil action [citation], the filing of an amended complaint moots a motion directed to a prior complaint." (State Compensation Ins. Fund v. Superior Court (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1124, 1131)

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has considered the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication filed by the defendant, Starbucks Corporation, and has denied the motion as moot. The plaintiff, Michael Garcia, filed an amended complaint after the defendant filed its motion, which rendered the motion moot. The judge notes that an amended complaint supersedes all prior complaints, and therefore, the original complaint ceases to have any effect. The judge also notes that the amended complaint furnishes the sole basis for the cause of action, and the court may rule in favor of the defendant if it is shown that there are no triable material issues of fact that would permit recovery on that theory. In this case, the amended complaint has rendered the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication moot, and the court denies the motion.
