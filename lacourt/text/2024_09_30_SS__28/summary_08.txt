And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the documents submitted by the plaintiff, Mercury Insurance Company, in support of its request for a default judgment against defendants Susanna Babayan and Alisa Msryan. The plaintiff is seeking $50,309.75, consisting of $49,767.50 as demanded in the complaint and $542.25 in costs. However, the judge has denied the application because the plaintiff has not completed the required form, the CIV-100, which includes a declaration of mailing. The judge has also noted that the plaintiff's request for damages exceeds the amount demanded in the complaint, and has cited California law requiring adequate notice to defendants in cases involving default judgments. The judge has denied the application without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff can re-file its request if it completes the required form and provides adequate notice to the defendants.
