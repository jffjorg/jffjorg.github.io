LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Interrogatories 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides:         
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) 
          B.  Requests for
admission 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides: 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The requesting party may move
for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Motion to compel responses to special interrogatories 
On February 23, 2024, Plaintiff served special
interrogatories, set one, on Trustee.  Trustee did not serve timely responses and had
not served responses by the time Plaintiff filed the motion to compel.  
In opposition to Plaintiff’s motion to compel, Trustee
asserts that she did not timely serve responses to the special interrogatories
due to an inadvertent clerical mistake by the office of Trustee’s prior counsel.
 Trustee’s current counsel substituted
into the case on September 16, 2024 and intends to serve Trustee’s responses before
October 1, 2024.  Trustee asks that the
Court impose sanctions, if any, on Trustee’s prior counsel, the Law Offices of
Scott C. Stratman. 
Trustee has not shown that she has served responses to
Plaintiff’s special interrogatories.  The
Court grants the motion and orders Trustee to serve verified code-compliant responses
to the special interrogatories, set one, without objections by October 31,
2024. 
Plaintiff requests $2,810.00 in sanctions based on 10
hours of attorney time at $250.00 per hour and one $60.00 filing fee.  Counsel spent four hours to prepare the
motion and 1.5 hours on meet and confer efforts.  Counsel anticipated spending one hour to
review the opposition, 1.5 hours to prepare a reply, and two hours to attend
the hearing. 
The Court grants $810.00 in sanctions based on three hours
of attorney time and one filing fee.
B.   Motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests
for admission 
On
February 23, 2024, Plaintiff served requests for admission, set one, on
Trustee.  Trustee did not serve timely
responses and had not served responses by the time Plaintiff filed the motion
to deem matters admitted. 
On
September 30, 2024, Trustee’s counsel filed a declaration stating that, on
September 27, 2024, counsel’s office served Trustee’s verified responses to Plaintiff’s
requests for admission on all parties. 
The responses and verification are attached to the declaration. 
The
Court denies the motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280,
subdivision (c). 
Plaintiff
requests $2,810.00 in sanctions based on 10 hours of attorney time at $250.00
per hour and one $60.00 filing fee. 
Counsel spent four hours to prepare the motion and 1.5 hours on meet and
confer efforts.  Counsel anticipated
spending one hour to review the opposition, 1.5 hours to prepare a reply, and
two hours to attend the hearing. 
The
Court grants $810.00 in sanctions based on three hours of attorney time and one
filing fee.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280, subd. (c).) 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff Myung Shin’s motion to compel Defendant Elizabeth Yang, as
Trustee of the Elizabeth Yang Trust, to serve responses to Plaintiff’s special
interrogatories, set one.  The Court
orders Defendant Elizabeth Yang, as
Trustee of the Elizabeth Yang Trust, to serve verified code compliant responses
to the special interrogatories without objections by October 31, 2024. 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff Myung Shin’s motion to deem admitted matters specified
in requests for admission, set one, served on Defendant Elizabeth Yang as
Trustee of the Elizabeth Yang Trust. 
The
Court GRANTS in part Plaintiff Myung Shin’s requests for sanctions and orders
Defendant Elizabeth Yang, as Trustee of the Elizabeth Yang Trust, and her
former counsel Law Offices of Scott C. Stratman, jointly and severally, to pay
Plaintiff Myung Shin $1,620.00 ($810.00 for each motion) by October 31, 2024.  In all other respects, the Court DENIES Plaintiff's sanctions requests.
