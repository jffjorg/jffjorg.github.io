And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the plaintiff, Makenna S. Pound, will be granted relief from the waiver of trial by jury. The plaintiff had inadvertently failed to post jury fees prior to the initial case management conference, but has since paid the fees. The judge found that granting relief from the waiver will not prejudice the other parties and exercised discretion to grant the motion. The ruling is based on the California Constitution and the Code of Civil Procedure, which provide that the right to a trial by jury should be preserved and that a jury may only be waived in certain circumstances. The judge noted that the public policy favoring trial by jury and the lack of prejudice to the other parties support granting the motion.
