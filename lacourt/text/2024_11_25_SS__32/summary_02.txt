And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has considered the motion and the opposition papers, despite being filed three days late due to a Court holiday. The original hearing date was scheduled for March 6, 2025, but was re-scheduled to November 25, 2024. The Plaintiff filed their opposition on November 12, 2024, and the Defendants argued that it should be stricken because it was not timely filed. However, the Judge has exercised their discretion to consider the opposition papers. The Judge has also declined to address the Defendants' argument that res ipsa loquitur does not apply in this case.
