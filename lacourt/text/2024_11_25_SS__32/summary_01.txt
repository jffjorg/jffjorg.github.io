```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the defendants' motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication. The defendants argue that they did not have actual or constructive knowledge of the defect in the staircase and that they exercised reasonable care in the maintenance of the property. The plaintiff argues that the defendants failed to properly maintain the property and that the staircase collapse was a result of their negligence.

The Court finds that there is a triable issue of fact regarding whether a reasonable inspection could have revealed the defect and whether the January 18, 2018 inspection covered the subject staircase. The Court also finds that there is a triable issue of fact regarding whether Wrenn Chais' June 30, 2019 inspection was reasonable.

As a result, the Court denies the defendants' motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication. The defendants are ordered to provide notice of this ruling and file a proof of service of such.
