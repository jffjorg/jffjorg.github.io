[1] The
hearing for this motion was originally scheduled for March 6, 2025. On March 7,
2024, Defendants filed and served notice that the hearing date was re-scheduled
to the instant date: November 25, 2024. 


[2]
Plaintiff’s opposition was filed on November 12, 2024. In reply, Defendants
argue it should be stricken since it was not timely filed. (Reply, 3-4.) The
opposition must be filed and served at least fourteen days before the hearing.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (b)(2).) Fourteen days before the present
hearing was November 11, 2024, which was a Court holiday. Nevertheless, the
Court exercises its discretion to consider the opposition papers. (See Bozzi
v. Nordstrom, Inc. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 755, 765 [“A trial court has
broad discretion under rule 3.1300(d) of the Rules of Court to refuse to
consider papers served and filed beyond the deadline without a prior court
order finding good cause for late submission.”].)


[3] Although
Mora involved a commercial landowner, the same reasoning appears to apply
to residential landowners. (See, e.g., Mora, supra, 210 Cal.App.3d at
780 [discussing heightened responsibilities of residential landlords compared
with commercial landlords].)


[4] Given
this conclusion, the Court declines to address Defendants argument that res
ipsa loquitur does not apply. (Motion, 16.)
