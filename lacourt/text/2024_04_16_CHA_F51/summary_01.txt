And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to demurrers filed by the Defendants against the Plaintiff's first amended complaint. The Plaintiff alleged that Dr. Robinson performed a colectomy procedure on him without his informed consent, and that he also performed a follow-up surgery on him without his informed consent. The Judge found that the Plaintiff's causes of action for Medical Negligence, Lack of Informed Consent, and Medical Battery are flawed and sustained the demurrers. The Judge granted the Defendants 30 days leave to amend their demurrers. The Judge noted that the Plaintiff failed to oppose the demurrers and did not provide sufficient facts to support their causes of action.
