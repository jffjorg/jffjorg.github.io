Here is the English summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has granted the motion of State Farm General Insurance Company, the Plaintiff-in-Intervention, to file a complaint-in-intervention in this home improvement defect case involving Plaintiffs' swimming pool. State Farm seeks to intervene to protect its right of subrogation against the responsible party, having paid benefits to the Plaintiffs. The Court finds that State Farm's motion is timely, despite the Defendant's argument that it is late and will be prejudiced. The Court also finds that the intervention is mandatory, as State Farm has a right of subrogation and an interest in the property or transaction. The motion is granted, and State Farm shall separately file the complaint-in-intervention and serve notice of the court's decision to parties who have appeared.
