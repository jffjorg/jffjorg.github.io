And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motions to compel responses to form interrogatories and requests for production of documents from the plaintiffs. The defendant, MED (DE), LLC, owns and operates an apartment complex where the plaintiffs, Guadalupe Javier Lepe and Jaclyn Christine Cruz, are tenants. The plaintiffs have allegedly experienced problems with the building, rendering it uninhabitable and breaching the implied warranty of quiet enjoyment and habitability. The defendant served the plaintiffs with discovery requests on June 15, 2023, and an extension was granted to September 14, 2023, but the plaintiffs have not responded. The defendant's motions are GRANTED, and the plaintiffs are ordered to serve responses without objections within 30 days. Monitory sanctions are denied.
