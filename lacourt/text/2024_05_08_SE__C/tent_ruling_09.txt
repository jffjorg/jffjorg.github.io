TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Defendant
Sunrun Inc.’s motion to compel arbitration is GRANTED.
 
Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
The
motion is unopposed as of May 3, 2024. 
 
 
This is a fraud and breach of contract action
regarding the sale and installation of solar panels at a residence. Defendant Sunrun,
Inc. moves to compel arbitration based on the power purchase agreement
Plaintiff Beatriz Camarillo purportedly signed.  
 
Discussion
 
Parties may be compelled to arbitrate a dispute upon the court finding
the following: (1) there was a valid agreement to arbitrate between the
parties; and (2) said agreement covers the controversy or controversies in the
parties’ dispute.¿(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2; Omar v. Ralphs Grocery Co.
(2004)¿118 Cal.App.4th 955, 961.)
 
A party petitioning to compel arbitration has the burden of establishing
the existence of a valid agreement to arbitrate and the party opposing the
petition has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, any
fact necessary to its defense. (Banner Entertainment, Inc. v. Super. Ct.¿(1998)
62 Cal.App.4th 348, 356-57.) 
 
The initial burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement
is on Defendant, and Defendant can do this by attaching a copy of the
arbitration agreement purporting to bear the respondent’s signature. (See Bannister
v. Marinidence Opco, LLC (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th
541, 541-543.) Alternatively, the moving party can set forth the agreement’s
provisions in the motion. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1330; see also Condee
v. Longwood Management Corp. (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 215, 219.) 
 
Here, Defendant attached the arbitration agreement purporting to bear
Plaintiff’s signature. (Decl. Molton, ¶ 6, Ex. 1.)  The Court finds that Defendant met its burden.

 
¿“If the moving party meets its initial prima facie burden and the
opposing party disputes the agreement, then in the second step, the opposing
party bears the burden of producing evidence to challenge the authenticity of
the agreement.” (Gamboa v. Northeast Community Clinic¿(2021) 72 Cal.App.5th
158, 165.)
 
The motion is unopposed. Thus, the Court grants the motion to compel
arbitration.  
 
If a court has ordered arbitration of a
controversy which is pending before a court, upon motion of a party to such
action or proceeding, the court shall stay the action or proceeding until an
arbitration occurs in accordance with the order to arbitrate or until such
earlier time as the court specifies. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.4.)
 
The action is stayed pending the arbitration.
