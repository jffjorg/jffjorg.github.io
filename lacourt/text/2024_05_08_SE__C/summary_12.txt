And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Quinones et al. v. Palema Trucking Inc et al. The ruling addresses two motions: Brian Jacobson's motion to be relieved as counsel for Alma Veronica Quinones and the motion to be relieved as counsel for Martha Gonzalez Rodriguez. The judge grants the motion to be relieved as counsel for Martha Gonzalez Rodriguez, but continues Brian Jacobson's motion to be relieved as counsel for Alma Veronica Quinones until May 22, 2024. The judge's ruling is based on the Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 3-700(C), which allows for an attorney to withdraw if there is a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship or other good cause. In this case, the attorney-client relationship has broken down, and the judge requires Brian Jacobson to amend his declaration to state how he confirmed Alma Veronica Quinones' last known address.
