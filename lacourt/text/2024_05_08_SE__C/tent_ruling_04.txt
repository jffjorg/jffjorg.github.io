in the building. Plaintiffs allege they have experienced various problems with

Legal Standard
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (b) allows the propounding
party to file a motion to compel responses to interrogatories if a response has
not been received.  If responses are
untimely, the responding party waives objections. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
subd. (a).)  
 
Similarly, Code of
Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (b) allows the propounding party
to file a motion to compel responses to document demands if a response has not
been received.  If responses are untimely, the responding party waives
objections. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
 
Discussion
 
Defendant served Plaintiffs with form
interrogatories and requests for production of documents on June 15, 2023, by
electronic mail. (Decl. Lezon, ¶¶ 2, 3, Ex. A.) Responses were due on
or before July 20, 2023. (Id., ¶4.)
Defendant granted an extension to September 14, 2023. (Id., ¶ 5.) Despite
this extension, Defendant has not received responses. (Id., ¶ 6.)   
 
Accordingly, the motions are GRANTED.  Plaintiffs are ordered to serve responses
without objections within 30 days.  
 
Sanctions:  Discovery sanctions may not be imposed
under Section 2023.030, even together with Section 2023.010, absent another
provision of the Discovery Act that authorizes the imposition of sanctions. (City
of L. A. v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466,
500.) Sanctions with respect to interrogatories and requests for production of
documents are only authorized against a party who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel responses. (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2030.290, subd. (c);
Code of Civ. Proc. § 2031.300, subd. (c).) Here, sanctions are denied because
the motions are unopposed.
