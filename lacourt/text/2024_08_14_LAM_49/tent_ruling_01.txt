Judicial NoticePursuant to the moving party’s request, the court takes judicial notice of its April 19, 2024 Minute Order granting the special motion to strike. (Exh. 1.)II. Legal StandardA prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike “shall” be entitled to recover its attorney’s fees and costs.  (CCP 425.16(c)(1).) A party may file a noticed motion for attorney's fees after receiving a successful ruling on the anti-SLAPP motion. (Martin v. Inland Empire Utilities Agency (2011) 198 Cal. App. 4th 611, 631.)The determination of reasonable amount of attorney fees is within the sound discretion of trial courts.  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095; Akins v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000) 79 Cal. App. 4th 1127, 1134.)  “The determination of what constitutes a reasonable fee generally ‘begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate….’”  “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”  (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)  In setting the hourly rate for an attorney fees award, courts are entitled to consider the rate of “‘fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community for similar work.’”  (Bihun v. AT&T Information Systems, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal. App. 4th 976, 997 overruled on other grounds by Lakin v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 644, 664.)  The burden is on the party seeking attorney fees to prove reasonableness of the fees.  (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal. App. 4th 603, 615.) The Court has broad discretion in determining the amount of a reasonable attorney's fee award which will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal. App. 4th 1379, 1393-94.  The Court need not explain its calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded in detail; identifying the factors considered in arriving at the amount will suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Industries Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-75.) III. AnalysisOn April 19, 2024, this court granted Cross-Defendant Wang’s special motion to strike the Cross-Complaint in its entirety. As such, there is no dispute he is entitled to recover attorney’s fees in connection with the successful special motion to strike. In total, Wang seeks $19,932.50 in fees.A. Reasonable Hourly RateThe vast majority of the work in this case was done by Attorney Aaron A. Kupchella. (Kupchella Decl. ¶¶ 2, 3, 4.) Attorney Kupchella has over eleven years of experience as a practicing attorney in Southern California. (Id. ¶ 7.) He billed at a rate of $475 per hour. (Id.) He attests that this hourly rate “is reasonable and on par with the prevailing rates in the community for similar work by attorneys with similar experience and qualifications.” (Id. ¶ 8.) Attorney Kupchella was assisted by Laura Thomas, an experienced paralegal who spent 1.1 hours proofreading the motion and reply. (Id. 4.) Ms. Thomas billed at a rate of $200 per hour.Here, the court concludes the quoted hourly rates of $475 and $200 are reasonable based on the prevailing rates in the Los Angeles area, the complexity of the case, the quality of services provided, and the respective experiences.  B. Hours Reasonably IncurredThe fee award “should ordinarily include compensation for all the hours reasonably spent, including those relating solely to the fee.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal. 4th 1122, 1133 [emphasis in the original].) Attorney Kupchella attests to billing 38.1 hours in connection with the successful anti-SLAPP motion. (Kupchella Decl. ¶ 2.) In addition, counsel attests to have spent 3.4 hours in connection with the instant motion for attorney’s fees. (Id. ¶ 5.) Paralegal Thomas spent 1.1 hours proofreading the anti-SLAPP motion and reply brief. (Id. ¶ 4.) By failing to oppose the motion, Cross-Complainant has not demonstrated that the requested award is unreasonable. "[I]t is the burden of the challenging party to point to the specific items challenged [within the moving party’s verified billing invoice], with a sufficient argument and citations to evidence.”  (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488.)  Here, considering the totality of the circumstances—including the complexity of the motion, the quality of the work, and the motion’s success—the court finds the time quoted was reasonable and recoverable.   Accordingly, utilizing a lodestar approach, and in view of the totality of the circumstances, this court finds and awards the full requested amount of $19,932.50 in attorney’s fees.IT IS SO ORDERED.Dated:   August 14, 2024 ___________________________________ Randolph M.
