And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Sagebrook Home, LLC's motion to compel arbitration of the employment dispute with Plaintiff Margarita Valle. The judge found that Defendant has not established the existence of an agreement to arbitrate by a preponderance of the evidence. The judge noted that while California has a strong public policy in favor of arbitration, parties can only be compelled to arbitrate when they have agreed to do so. The judge concluded that Plaintiff's continued employment, without more, is insufficient evidence of an implied-in-fact agreement to arbitrate. The judge also noted that there is no evidence that arbitration was a condition of employment or that continued employment would constitute acceptance of the agreement. Therefore, the judge denied Defendant's motion to compel arbitration.
