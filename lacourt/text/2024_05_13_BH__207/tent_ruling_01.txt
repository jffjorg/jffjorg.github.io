Defendant Millennium Medical Associates, Inc.



 
BACKGROUND
 
On or about November 4, 2020, Plaintiff Pericles Chamis (“Plaintiff”)
underwent an upper endoscopy procedure, during which “Plaintiff began vomiting
and convulsing on the operating table.” 
(Fifth Amended Complaint [“5AC”] ¶¶ 20, 26.)  A subsequent MRI revealed that Plaintiff
suffered a stroke, causing central visual impairment, dysphagia, and cognitive
and behavioral issues.  (5AC ¶ 32.)  
 
On October 12, 2021, Plaintiff brought suit against the surgeon,
Defendant Dale Prokupek, M.D. and Defendant Dale Prokupek, M.D., Inc.
(“Prokupek”); anesthesiologist Defendant Michelle Dinh, M.D. (“Dinh”); and Defendant
Soma Surgery Center, Inc. (“Soma”), where the endoscopy was performed, alleging
three causes of action: (1) professional negligence – medical malpractice; (2)
breach of fiduciary duty; and (3) intentional misrepresentation.
 
Dr. Prokupek’s nurse practitioner, Defendant Jeanne Hershey-Weber
(“Hershey-Weber”); the nurse who assisted during the procedure, Defendant
Melanie Kerr (“Kerr”); Dr. Prokupek’s employee Defendant Andrew Gelis
(“Gelis”); and Dr. Prokupek’s other company, Defendant Millennium Medical
Associates, Inc. (“Millennium”) were added via Doe amendment on November 18,
2022, in place of Does 1-4, respectively.  Defendant Sean Ravaei (“Ravaei”), owner and
operator of Soma, was added to the complaint via Doe amendment on December 1,
2022, in place of Doe 5.
 
On February 27, 2024, the Court granted Millennium’s motion for
summary judgment.  Judgment was entered in
Millennium’s favor on March 14, 2024.
 
Plaintiff now moves for reconsideration of the Court’s February 27,
2024 order granting summary judgment in favor of Millennium.  Millennium opposes and Plaintiff replies.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1008, subdivision (a), “[w]hen an application for an order has been
made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or
granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within
10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order
and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make an
application to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the
matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order.  The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd. (a).)  Where
the statutory requirements are met, reconsideration should be granted; upon
reconsideration, however, the court may simply reaffirm its original
order.  (Corns v. Miller (1986)
181 Cal.App.3d 195, 202.)  
 
The moving party on a motion for
reconsideration “must provide not only new evidence but also a satisfactory
explanation for the failure to produce that evidence at an earlier time[.]” (Mink
v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342, internal quotations
& citations omitted; see New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005)
135 Cal.App.4th 206, 221 [on a motion for reconsideration, a party must present
new or different facts, circumstances, or law, which the moving party “could
not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered or produced” in connection with
the original hearing].)
 
JURISDICTION
 
As Millennium points out, “after entry of judgment, a trial court has
no further power to rule on a motion for reconsideration.”  (Ramon v. Aerospace Corp. (1996) 50
Cal.App.4th 1233, 1236.)  “Once judgment
has been entered […] the court may not reconsider it and loses its unrestricted
power to change the judgment. It may correct judicial error only through
certain limited procedures such as motions for new trial and motions to vacate
the judgment.”  (Ibid.)
 
This is true even where, as here, the motion for reconsideration was
filed before judgment, but judgment was entered prior to the scheduled
hearing.  (See Safeco Insurance
Company of Illinois v. Architectural Facades Unlimited, Inc. (2005) 134
Cal.App.4th 1477.)
 
In Reply, Plaintiff argues that the Court has jurisdiction because
Plaintiff filed the motion within 10 days after service of written notice of
the entry of the Court’s summary judgment order, as required by Code of Civil
Procedure section 1008.  Plaintiff
further argues that if the Court were divested of jurisdiction to hear
Plaintiff’s motion, “Section 1008 would be rendered meaningless.”  (Reply at p. 2.)
 
Although Plaintiff complied with the jurisdictional requirements of Section
1008, the law is clear that entry of the judgment divests the Court of
jurisdiction to hear Plaintiff’s pending motion for reconsideration.  
 
Moreover, Section 1008 is not rendered meaningless by virtue of this
rule.  Motions for reconsideration are
still a valid way of challenging orders prior to entry of judgment.  Once judgment has been entered, however, the
parties are limited to pursuing post-judgment remedies.[1]
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
            Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion for
reconsideration is denied because the Court no longer has jurisdiction to rule
on it.  
 
            The Clerk of the Court shall provide
notice of the Court’s ruling.
