And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Michael E. Whitaker regarding a motion for reconsideration of a summary judgment in favor of Millennium Medical Associates, Inc. The plaintiff, Pericles Chamis, underwent an upper endoscopy procedure on November 4, 2020, which resulted in a stroke and resulting injuries. The plaintiff alleges medical malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty. The court previously granted summary judgment in favor of Millennium, which the plaintiff is now seeking to reconsider. The court denies the motion for reconsideration, citing the fact that once judgment has been entered, the court has no further power to rule on the motion. The court further explains that the plaintiff failed to provide new or different facts, circumstances, or law to support their motion. The court's decision is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, which governs motions for reconsideration.
