BACKGROUND
 
On May 14, 2018, Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant James Lee doing
business as JCL Contractors (“Plaintiff” or “Lee”) brought suit against
Defendants and Cross-Complainants Emaar LA Properties, LLC (“Emaar”) and EJL
Homes Realty & Construction, Inc. (“EJL”) (together, “Cross-Complainants”),
stemming from a construction dispute.   
 
On September 4, 2018, Cross-Complainants filed a cross-complaint
against Plaintiff.  From May 14, 2018
when the original complaint was filed until April or May 2022, the parties did
not conduct any discovery.  (Ralls Decl.
¶ 10; Lee Decl. ¶ 9.)  During that time,
the parties attended four mediations on December 4, 2018; October 29, 2020;
August 19, 2021; and November 11, 2021. 
(Lee Decl. ¶ 6.)  
 
On May 4, 2023, the parties filed a stipulation to extend the 5-year
deadline to May 14, 2024.  The parties
settled Plaintiff’s claims and the original complaint was dismissed on August
9, 2023.  Pursuant to the parties’
stipulation, the First Amended Cross-Complaint was filed on August 8, 2023, naming
Lee and JCL Contractors, Inc. (“JCL”). 
Lee was dismissed from the cross-complaint on August 17, 2023.  Default was entered against JCL on September
26, 2023.
 
From September 26, 2023, when default was entered against JCL until early
February 2024, Cross-Complainants were in discussions and document exchanges with
AIG, JCL’s insurance provider, in expectation that AIG would defend JCL and/or intervene
in the lawsuit.  (Pursiano Decl. ¶¶ 8-13.)  On February 2, 2024, AIG advised it would not
defend JCL or intervene. 
Cross-Complainants asked AIG to reconsider, and on February 9, 2024, AIG
reiterated its position that it would not defend JCL or provide indemnity
coverage to JCL.  (Pursiano Decl. ¶ 13.)
 
Cross-complainants now move to extend the 5-year deadline.  The motion unopposed.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310, “[a]n action shall be brought to trial within
five years after the action is commenced against the defendant.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 583.310.)  In computing the
five-year deadline, the following time periods are excluded: (a) the
jurisdiction of the court to try the action was suspended; (b) prosecution or
trial of the action was stayed or enjoined; and (c) bringing the action to
trial, for any other reason, was impossible, impracticable, or futile.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 583.340.)
 
“An action shall be dismissed by the court on its own motion or on
motion of the defendant, after notice to the parties, if the action is not
brought to trial within the time prescribed in this article.  The requirements of this article are
mandatory and are not subject to extension, excuse, or exception except as
expressly provided by statute.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 583.360.)  Dismissal is
warranted where the plaintiff has failed to prosecute the action with
“reasonable diligence.”  (Dunsmuir
Masonic Temple v. Superior Court (1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 17, 22-23.)  However, Civil Code of Procedure section
583.330 provides:
 
The parties may extend the time within which an
action must be brought to trial pursuant to this article by the following
means: 
 
(a) By written stipulation.  The stipulation need not be filed but, if it
is not filed, the stipulation shall be brought to the attention of the court if
relevant to a motion for dismissal.  
 
(b) By oral agreement made in open court, if
entered in the minutes of the court or a transcript is made.
 
            Moreover, “If the time within which
an action must be brought to trial pursuant to this article is tolled or
otherwise extended pursuant to statute with the result that at the end of the
period of tolling or extension less than six months remains within which the action
must be brought to trial, the action shall not be dismissed pursuant to this
article if the action is brought to trial within six months after the end of
the period of tolling or extension.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 583.350.)
 
ANALYSIS
 
Cross-Complainants argue that bringing the action to trial was
impossible to bring the action to trial after default was entered against JCL
on September 26, 2023.  In support,
Cross-Complainants cite to Maguire v. Collier (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 309,
which noted that the period between entry of default and default judgment must
be excluded from the five-year rule calculation, and the Court has no
discretion.  (Id. at p. 313.)  That rule was criticized and held to be
dictum by Hughes v. Kimble (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th, which held “[t]he
critical factor in determining whether the exception applies in a given factual
situation is whether the plaintiff has exercised reasonable diligence in
prosecuting his or her case.”  (Id.
at p. 67.)
 
In Howard v. Thrifty Drug & Discount Stores (1995) 10
Cal.4th 424, the Supreme Court held that the five-year statute was tolled
during the period in which the defendant attempted to vacate the default, until
default was successfully vacated.  (Id.
at p. 438.)
 
Here, default was entered against JCL on September 26, 2023 and
Cross-Complainants requested default judgment on March 29, 2024.  However, default judgment cannot be entered on
the existing Cross-Complaint, because it does not allege the specific amount of
damages sought.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §
580, subd. (a) [“The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer,
cannot exceed that demanded in the complaint”]; Levine v. Smith (2006)
145 Cal.App.4th 1131, 1136-1137 [“when recovering damages in a default judgment,
the plaintiff is limited to the damages specified in the complaint”].)  Thus, Cross-Complainants have filed the
concurrent motion for leave to amend the cross-complaint and this motion to
extend the five-year deadline.
 
Because default was entered against JCL before the five-year deadline expired
and because it is impossible to bring the action to trial while the only
remaining cross-defendant is in default, the Court agrees that the five-year
deadline was tolled as of September 26, 2023. 

 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants Cross-Complainants’ motion and deems the
five-year deadline tolled as of September 26, 2023, when default was entered
against JCL.  
 
Cross-Complainants shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file
the notice with a proof of service forthwith.

BACKGROUND
 
On May 14, 2018, Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant James Lee doing
business as JCL Contractors (“Plaintiff” or “Lee”) brought suit against
Defendants and Cross-Complainants Emaar LA Properties, LLC (“Emaar”) and EJL
Homes Realty & Construction, Inc. (“EJL”) (together, “Cross-Complainants”),
stemming from a construction dispute.  On
September 4, 2018, Cross-Complainants filed a cross-complaint against
Plaintiff.  
 
On May 4, 2023, the parties filed a stipulation to extend the 5-year
deadline to May 14, 2024.  The parties
settled Plaintiff’s claims and the original complaint was dismissed on August
9, 2023.  Pursuant to the parties’
stipulation, the First Amended Cross-Complaint (“FACC”) was filed on August 8,
2023, naming Lee and JCL Contractors, Inc. (“JCL”).  Lee was dismissed from the cross-complaint on
August 17, 2023.  Default was entered
against JCL on September 26, 2023.
 
From September 26, 2023, when default was entered against JCL until
early February 2024, Cross-Complainants were in discussions and document
exchanges with AIG, JCL’s insurance provider, in hopes that AIG would defend
JCL and/or intervene in the lawsuit.  On
February 2, 2024, AIG advised it would not defend JCL or intervene.  (Ralls Decl. ¶ 12.) 
 
            On
March 29, 2024, Cross-Complainants moved for default judgment against JCL,
which the Court is unable to grant because the specific dollar amounts are not
alleged in the FACC.  
 
Cross-complainants now move for leave to amend the cross-complaint to
specify the amount of damages sought and to clarify that Cross-Defendant Lee
has since been dismissed from the cross-action. 
The motion is unopposed.  
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Amendments
to Pleadings: General Provisions
 
            Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (a)(1), “The court may, in furtherance of justice, and
on any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading or
proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a
mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect; and may,
upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or demurrer. The court may
likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon any
terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other
particulars; and may upon like terms allow an answer to be made after the time
limited by this code.”
 
            To wit, without notice to the other
party the Court has wide discretion to allow either party (i) to add or strike
the name of a party or (ii) to correct a mistake in the name of a party or a
mistake in any other respect “in furtherance of justice” and “on any terms as
may be proper.” (See Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1); see also Marriage
of Liss (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1429.) Alternatively, after notice to
the other party, the Court has wide discretion to allow either party to amend
pleadings “upon any terms as may be just.” (See Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (a)(1). Similarly, Code of Civil Procedure section 576 states “Any judge,
at any time before or after commencement of trial, in the furtherance of
justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow the amendment of any
pleading or pretrial conference order.”
 
            Judicial policy favors resolution of
all disputed matters between the parties and, therefore, leave to amend is
liberally granted. (Berman vs. Bromberg (1986) 56 Cal.App.4th 936, 945; Hirsa
v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 488-489 [this has been an
established policy in California since 1901] (citing Frost v. Whitter
(1901) 132 Cal. 421, 424; Thomas v. Bruza (1957) 151 Cal.App.2d 150,
155).) The Court of Appeal in Morgan v. Superior Court held “If the
motion to amend is timely made and the granting of the motion will not
prejudice the opposing party, it is error to refuse permission to amend and
where the refusal also results in a party being deprived of the right to assert
a meritorious cause of action or a meritorious defense, it is not only error
but an abuse of discretion.” (Morgan v. Superior Court (1959) 172
Cal.App.2d 527, 530, citations omitted.) Moreover, “it is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where the opposing party was
not misled or prejudiced by the amendment.” (Kittredge Sports Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048 [opposing party did not
establish harm by the delay in moving to amend the complaint].)
 
            “The court may grant leave to amend
the pleadings at any stage of the action.” (Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023) ¶ 6:636 (hereafter
Weil & Brown).) Denial of a motion to amend is rarely justified if the
motion is timely made and granting the motion will not prejudice the opposing
party. (Id. at ¶ 6:639, citations omitted.) However, if the party
seeking the amendment has been dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced the
opposing party, the judge has discretion to deny leave to amend. (Id. at
¶ 6:655, citations omitted. Absent prejudice, any claimed delay alone is not
grounds for denial. “If the delay in seeking the amendment has not misled or
prejudiced the other side, the liberal policy of allowing amendments prevails.
Indeed, it is an abuse of discretion to deny leave in such a case even if
sought as late as the time of trial. (Id. at ¶ 6:653 (citing Higgins
v. Del Faro (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 558, 564-565).) “Prejudice exists where
the amendment would result in a delay of trial, along with loss of critical
evidence, added costs of preparation, increased burden of discovery, etc. . . .
But the fact that the amendment involves a change in legal theory which would
make admissible evidence damaging to the opposing party is not the kind of
prejudice the court will consider.” (Weil & Brown, supra, at
¶ 6:656, citations omitted.)
 
            “Even if some prejudice is shown,
the judge may still permit the amendment but impose conditions, as the Court is
authorized to grant leave ‘on such terms as may be proper.’” (Weil &
Brown, supra, at ¶ 6:663, citation omitted.) For example, the court
may cause the party seeking the amendment to pay the costs and fees incurred in
preparing for trial. (Id. at ¶ 6:664 (citing Fuller v. Vista Del
Arroyo Hotel, 42 Cal.App.2d 400, 404).)
 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1324: Procedural Requirements
 
            Pursuant to California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1324(a), a motion to amend a pleading before trial must:
 
“(1) Include a copy of the proposed amendment or
amended pleadings, which must be serially numbered to differentiate it from
previous pleadings or amendments;
(2) state what allegations in the previous
pleading are proposed to be deleted, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and
line number, the deleted allegations are located; and
(3) State what allegations are proposed to be
added to the previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line
number, the additional allegations are located.”
 
            In addition, under Rule 3.1324(b), a
motion to amend a pleading before trial must be accompanied by a separate
declaration that specifies the following:
 
“(1) the effect of the amendment;
(2) why the amendment is necessary and proper;
(3) when the facts giving rise to the amended
allegations were discovered; and
(4) the reasons why the request for amendment was
not made earlier.”
 
DISCUSSION
 
            In
support of the motion, Plaintiff has provided the Declaration of Cynthia D.
Ralls, attached to which is a clean copy of the proposed Second Amended Cross-Complaint,
as well as a red-lined version showing the changes and a separate list of all
changes.  The Ralls Declaration further
indicates that Cross-Complainants discovered JCL was a necessary party through
discovery responses, and the parties stipulated to amend the original
Cross-Complaint to add JCL on or about July 28, 2023.  (Ralls Decl. ¶¶ 9-10.)  The First Amended Cross-Complaint (“FACC”)
was filed on August 8, 2023 and served on August 14.  (Ralls Decl. ¶¶ 10-11.)  Default was entered against JCL on September
26, 2023.  (Ralls Decl. ¶ 11.)  After it became clear on February 2, 2024 that
JCL’s insurer, AIG would not be defending JCL or intervening in the action,
Cross-Complainants filed a request for default judgment against JCL on March
29, 2024.  (Ralls Decl. ¶¶ 12-13.)  The Court could not enter default judgment
against JCL because the specific amounts requested were not alleged in the
FACC.  (Ralls Decl. ¶ 13; see also Code
Civ. Proc., § 580, subd. (a) [“The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is
no answer, cannot exceed that demanded in the complaint”]; Levine v.
Smith (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 1131,
1136-1137 [“when recovering damages in a default judgment, the plaintiff is
limited to the damages specified in the complaint”].)  
 
            Therefore, the Motion satisfies the
procedural requirements.  Substantively,
the Court agrees that the Motion is necessary and proper so to apprise JCL of
the damages being sought against it, as due process requires before default
judgment can be entered.
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
            Finding the motion both procedurally
and substantively proper, the Court grants Cross-Complainants’ motion for leave
to amend the Cross-Complaint. 
Cross-Complainants shall file and serve the proposed Second Amended
Cross-Complaint on or before June 10, 2024.
 
            Further, the Court continues the
Order to Show Cause re: Entry of Default Judgment from May 15, 2024 to August
28, 2024 at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207. 
Cross-Complainants shall file the request for entry of default and
default judgment regarding the amended cross-complaint on or before July 31,
2024.  If default judgment is entered before
August 28, 2024, no appearance will be necessary at the Order to Show Cause
hearing.
 
Cross-Complainants shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file
the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
