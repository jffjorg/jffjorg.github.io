And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case between Silva Sadhegian, the plaintiff, and Glendale Adventist Medical Center dba Adventist Health Glendale and Adventist Health Foundation, the defendants. The defendants have filed a demurrer and motion to strike the complaint, arguing that it is barred by the statute of limitations and that the plaintiff lacks standing to pursue the claims. The judge has considered the demurrer and motion to strike, despite being filed several months late, and has sustained the demurrer with leave to amend. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to amend the complaint to clearly allege the basis for any standing to pursue a claim on behalf of the decedent, Esraeil Ghadimi, and to allege the inclusion of all necessary parties to the wrongful death claim. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff to identify a "first" and "second" cause of action, rather than two "first" causes of action. The parties are ordered to meet and confer in compliance with CCP sections 430.41 and 435.5 before filing any further demurrer or motion to strike.
