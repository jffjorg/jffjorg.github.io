And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer to the first cause of action for negligence and second cause of action for NIED brought by the defendant California Interscholastic Federation (CIF). The court has determined that the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) fails to sufficiently allege a legal or factual basis for the imposition or assumption of a negligence duty on CIF or conduct on the part of CIF which resulted in the plaintiff's alleged damages.

The court has also determined that the plaintiff has failed to correct the deficiencies despite being permitted leave to amend to do so. The court has previously permitted the plaintiff to amend the FAC to address the issues raised by the demurrer, but the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate how the complaint might be amended to cure it of its defects.

Accordingly, the court has sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action for negligence and second cause of action for NIED without leave to amend. The court has also determined that the plaintiff will be unable to correct the flaws in its claims against CIF on further amendment, and therefore the demurrer by this defendant is now sustained without further leave to amend.
