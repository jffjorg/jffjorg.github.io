The City of Glendale seeks to file the cross-complaint for implied indemnity, express indemnity, contribution, comparative fault, and declaratory relief. The judge has determined that it is in the interest of justice to grant the motion, as it would allow all issues and claims arising out of the incident to be determined in one action. The judge notes that the City of Glendale has not established or explained any good faith in filing the cross-complaint, but has not found any prejudice or inexcusable delay. The judge has ordered the City of Glendale to file its signed cross-complaint by the close of business on the same date.
