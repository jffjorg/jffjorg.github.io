And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for order changing the name of the plaintiff/judgment creditor from Pacific Western Bank to Banc of California. The motion was brought by Banc of California, formerly known as Pacific Western Bank, without opposition. The Judge found that the moving party lacks legal authority to seek this relief, as it is not a named party to the action. Additionally, the Judge found that the documentation submitted by the moving party, including a declaration of counsel and a certificate of merger, fails to constitute an acknowledgment of assignment or a court order evidencing assignment of judgment by operation of law. As a result, the motion is denied without prejudice.
