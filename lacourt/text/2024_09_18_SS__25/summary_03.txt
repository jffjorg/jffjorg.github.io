And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the motion for terminating sanctions filed by the defendants, Terry Bowen and Cassandra Davis, against plaintiff Patty Smith. The plaintiff failed to respond to discovery, failed to pay monetary sanctions, and disobeyed court orders to do so. The Judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery orders was willful and that lesser sanctions would not curb the abuse. The Judge dismisses the plaintiff's complaint without prejudice and advances the trial date to October 7, 2024. The Judge also declines to impose monetary sanctions.
