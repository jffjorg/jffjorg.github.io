ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
            “The primary function of a pleading
is to give the other party notice so that it may prepare its case [citation],
and a defect in a pleading that otherwise properly notifies a party cannot be
said to affect substantial rights.” (Harris
v. City of Santa Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th 203, 240.) “A demurrer tests
the legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff v. Bank of America, N.A. (2017)
9 Cal.App.5th 719, 725.) The Court looks to whether “the complaint alleges facts
sufficient to state a cause of action or discloses a complete defense.” (Ibid.) The Court does not “read passages
from a complaint in isolation; in reviewing a ruling on a demurrer, we read the
complaint ‘as a whole and its parts in their context.’ [Citation.]” (West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013)
214 Cal.App.4th 780, 804.) The Court “assume[s] the truth of the properly
pleaded factual allegations, facts that reasonably can be inferred from those
expressly pleaded and matters of which judicial notice has been taken.” (Harris, supra, 56 Cal.4th p. 240.) “The
court does not, however, assume the truth of contentions, deductions or
conclusions of law. [Citation.]” (Durell
v.Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)
 
            A general demurrer may be brought
under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (e) if insufficient
facts are stated to support the cause of action asserted or under section
430.10, subdivision (a), where the court has no jurisdiction of the subject of
the cause of action alleged in the pleading. All other grounds listed in
Section 430.10, including uncertainty under subdivision (f), are special
demurrers. Special demurrers are not allowed in limited jurisdiction courts.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 92, subd. (c).)
 
            Leave to amend must be allowed where
there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335,
348.)  The burden is on the complainant
to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.) 
 
            Finally, Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the
responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).)
Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing
their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3).)
 
II.        Judicial Notice 
 
            Defendant’s request for judicial
notice is granted as to Exhibit A (Plaintiff’s Complaint) and denied as to
Exhibit 2 (Declaration of City Clerk). Defendant cites to no authority that a
declaration from a Deputy City Clerk constitute “official acts” of the City of
Los Angeles. Official acts typically include “administrative and executive
acts, such as proceedings and reports of the House Committee on Un-American
Activities, records of the State Board of Education, and records of [the]
county planning commission.” (Evid. Code, § 452, see comments.) This section of
the Evidence Code was designed to allow the court to take judicial notice of
acts done by the various government branches or of the official records created
in the process of forming laws. (See McGlothlen v. Department of Motor
Vehicles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 1005, 1015.) Paperwork alone does not rise to
the level of being an “official act” simply because it was created by a
governmental body. The documents offered by Defendant are not within the traditional
understanding of “official acts” as recognized under the Evidence Code. 
 
III.       Discussion
 
            Defendant has satisfied the meet and confer requirement.
(Mavian Decl., ¶¶4-5.)
 
            Defendant demurs to the Complaint on
the basis that Plaintiff did not satisfy the claims presentation requirement. 
 
            “[N]o suit
for money or damages may be brought against a public entity on a cause of
action for which a claim is required to be presented . . . until a written
claim therefor has been presented to the public entity and has been acted upon
by the board, or has been deemed to have been rejected by the board . . . .”
(Gov. Code, § 945.4.) A failure to timely present a claim for money or damages
to a public entity bars a plaintiff from filing a lawsuit against that entity.
(See City of Stockton v. Superior Court (2007) 42 Cal.4th 730, 738.) Failure
to allege facts in the complaint demonstrating compliance with the
pre-litigation governmental claims presentation requirements subjects the
complaint to a general demurrer. (State of Calif. v. Sup.Ct. (Bodde)
(2004) 32 Cal.4th 1234, 1239; see also V.C. v. Los Angeles Unified School
Dist.¿(2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 499, 509 [affirming trial court decision to
sustain demurrer without leave to amend on the ground that V.C.'s failure to
timely comply with the requirements of the Tort Claims Act barred her action].)
 
            Here, there
are no allegations that Plaintiff complied with the claim presentation
requirement. Therefore, the demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
IV.       Conclusion 
            
            Defendant’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint is
SUSTAINED with twenty (20) days leave to amend. 
            
Moving Party is ordered to give notice.
