And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the City of Los Angeles (Defendant) against the Complaint filed by German Otamendi (Plaintiff). The Defendant demurred to the entire Complaint on the basis that the Plaintiff failed to comply with the claim presentation requirement of the Government Claims Act. The Judge found that the Plaintiff did not allege facts in the Complaint demonstrating compliance with the pre-litigation governmental claims presentation requirements, and therefore sustained the demurrer with leave to amend. The Plaintiff has 20 days to amend the Complaint. The Judge also granted the Defendant's request for judicial notice as to Exhibit A (Plaintiff's Complaint) and denied the request as to Exhibit 2 (Declaration of City Clerk).
