BACKGROUND
 
On April 11, 2022, Plaintiff Patty
Smith (“Plaintiff”) filed this personal injury against Defendants Terry Bowen
and Cassandra Davis (“Defendants”) for motor vehicle negligence.
 
On July 29, 2024, Defendants filed the instant motion for
terminating sanctions. Plaintiff’s counsel filed an opposition on August 26,
2024. Defendants filed a reply on September 11, 2024.
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Defendants
move for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff on the basis that Plaintiff
failed to comply with the Court’s April 29, 2024 and June 20, 2024 discovery
orders.
 
OPPOSITION
 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel has lost contact with Plaintiff and no sanctions are warranted against
counsel’s office.
 
REPLY
 
            Terminating
sanctions are warranted based on the “opposition.”
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard
            Where a party fails to obey an order
compelling answers to discovery, “the court may make those orders that are
just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.300; 2023.010, subd. (c); R.S.
Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 486, 495.)
The court may impose a terminating sanction against anyone engaging in conduct
that is a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(d).) Misuse of the discovery process includes failure to respond to an
authorized method of discovery or disobeying a court order to provide
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d), (g).) A terminating
sanction may be imposed by an order dismissing part or all of the action. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d)(3).)
 
            The court should consider the
totality of the circumstances, including conduct of the party to determine if
the actions were willful, the determent to the propounding party, and the
number of formal and informal attempts to obtain discovery. (Lang v. Hochman
(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) If a lesser sanction fails to curb abuse, a
greater sanction is warranted. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196
Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.) However, “the unsuccessful imposition of a lesser
sanction is not an absolute prerequisite to the utilization of the ultimate
sanction.” (Deyo v. Killbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 787.)
Terminating sanctions should not be ordered lightly, but are justified where a
violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and there is evidence
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules. (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.)
 
            Before any sanctions may be imposed
the court must make an express finding that there has been a willful failure of
the party to serve the required answers. (Fairfield v. Superior Court for
Los Angeles County (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.) Lack of diligence may
be deemed willful where the party understood its obligation, had the ability to
comply, and failed to comply. (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d
at p. 787; Fred Howland Co. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County
(1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 605, 610-611.) The party who failed to comply with
discovery obligations has the burden of showing that the failure was not
willful. (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 788; Cornwall v.
Santa Monica Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250; Evid. Code, §§ 500, 605.)
 
II.        Discussion
 
            Plaintiff’s opposition only consists of a declaration
from Plaintiff’s counsel stating they have lost contact with Plaintiff and no
sanctions are warranted against counsel’s office. It is undisputed that
Plaintiff failed to respond to discovery, failed to pay monetary sanctions, and
disobeyed Court orders to do so. Notices of the rulings were provided to Plaintiff
on April 30 and June 20, 2024. (Gardner Decl., Exhs. A-B.) Therefore, the Court
concludes Plaintiff knew of the discovery obligations, knew of the Court order
compelling compliance, and failed to show noncompliance was not willful. Given
the foregoing, the Court finds lesser sanctions would not curb the abuse.
 
            Accordingly, the motion for terminating
sanctions is GRANTED. As the Court is granting terminating sanctions it
declines to also impose monetary sanctions. 
 
III.       Conclusion 
            
            Defendants’ Motion for Terminating Sanctions is GRANTED.  Request for Monetary Sanctions is DENIED.  Plaintiff’s Complaint is Dismissed without
prejudice.  
 
The
10/07/2024 Trial is advanced to this date and hereby taken off calendar.
            
Moving Party is ordered to give notice of ruling.
