Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a Judge regarding a motion for summary judgment filed by Defendant Michelle Y. McNee, M.D. (DOE 1) in a wrongful death claim brought by Plaintiffs Gayne Ambartsumyan, et al. against several defendants, including Torrance Memorial Medical Center and Regents of the University of California. The Judge finds that Defendant McNee has carried her initial burden of showing that her care did not fall below the standard of care, and that Plaintiffs have failed to produce substantial responsive evidence to establish a triable issue of fact. Therefore, the Judge grants Defendant McNee's motion for summary judgment. The ruling is subject to change based on oral argument and the parties' agreement regarding the waiver of costs and potential claims for malicious prosecution incurred by Defendant McNee.
