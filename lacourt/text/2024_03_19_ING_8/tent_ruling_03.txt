I. BACKGROUND¿ 
¿ 
A. Factual¿ 
 
      On April 11, 2023, Plaintiff, Vinetta
Waller-Ngangu, filed a Complaint against Defendant, Kohl’s Inc., and DOES 1
through 75. The Complaint alleges causes of action for: (1) Premises Liability;
and (2) General Negligence. 
 
On
July 25, 2023, Defendant Kohl’s propounded its first set of discovery
Plaintiff’s prior counsel, including: Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Production of Documents, Set One.
Kohl’s notes that Plaintiff’s former counsel sought numerous extensions of time
to serve Plaintiff’s responses. The last extension was requested on October 2,
2023, where Plaintiff’s counsel sought a three-week extension to October 24,
2023. Instead, Kohls notes that it granted a two-week extension, making
discovery due on October 17, 2023. Nonetheless, Defendant Kohl’s notes that
Plaintiff’s prior counsel did not serve the responses by October 17, 2023 or any
time thereafter. 
 
      On October 17, 2023, Defendant Kohl’s
notes that Plaintiff’s prior counsel contacted Kohl’s to ask for another
extension to November 7, 2023 and stated they were “still having issues getting
a hold of Plaintiff, Ms. Waller-Ngangu.” Kohl’s notes that its counsel
responded on October 25, 2023 noting that responses were already past due and
that Kohl’s expected Plaintiff to provide responses, without objection, by
November 7, 2023. 
 
On
November 30, 2023, Plaintiff’s former counsel filed a motion to be relieved as
counsel, which was subsequently granted by this Court on January 2, 2024. The
order became final on January 8, 2024. 
 
On
February 22, 2024, this Court previously GRANTED Kohls’ Motion to Deem RFAs as
admitted as well as the award for monetary sanctions. 
            
 
B. Procedural  
 
            On February 21, 2024, Defendant
Kohl’s filed its motions to compel initial responses to Form Interrogatories,
Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of Documents Set One. To
date, no opposition has been filed. Plaintiff appears to be self-represented since
the Court granted the motion of prior counsel to be relieved from the representation.  
 
¿II.
ANALYSIS 
 
A. Legal Standard 
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting
party may move for an order compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The party also waives the right to make any
objections, including one based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) There is no time limit for a motion to
compel responses to interrogatories other than the cut-off on hearing discovery
motions 15 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a); Code
Civ. Proc., 2030.290.) No meet and confer efforts are required before filing a
motion to compel responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 41.) 
 
Further,
where there has been no timely response to a Code
of Civil Procedure § 2031.010 demand, the demanding party must seek an order
compelling a response. (CCP § 2031.300.) Failure to timely respond waives all
objections, including privilege and work product. Thus, unless the party to
whom the demand was directed obtains relief from waiver, he or she cannot raise
objections to the documents demanded. There is no deadline for a motion to
compel responses. Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving party need not
attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing the motion. Where the
motion seeks only a response to the inspection demand, no showing of "good
cause" is required. 
 
            B.
Discussion  
 
Defendant
Kohl’s notes that on July 25, 2023, it served its Set One of its discovery on
Plaintiff, when Plaintiff was then represented by counsel. However, despite
Kohl’s granting of multiple extensions, and waiting months for Plaintiff to
respond to said discovery, Plaintiff has failed to serve verified responses, or
any responses at all, to Kohl’s propounded discovery. The motion of former counsel
to be relieved as plaintiff’s attorney was not filed or granted until after the
deadline for written responses were past due. 
Because of this, the Court’s tentative ruling is to GRANT Defendant’s
motions. 
 
            C. Sanctions 
 
            Code of Civil
Procedure § 2023.030(a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may impose
a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process
to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone
because of that conduct.  Misuse of discovery includes “failing to respond
or submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  (Code Civ. Proc.
§¿2023.010(d)). 
 
            Along with Kohls’ Motion to Compel Form Interrogatories,
Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for Production of
Documents Set One, as admitted, Kohl’s also included a Request for Monetary
Sanctions in the amount of $935 per motion. This amount is based on counsel for
Kohls, Ara M. Baghdassarian’s hourly rate of $350, spending two and a half
hours preparing Kohl’s moving papers per motion, and $60 of costs per motion. Here,
the Court finds the hourly rate and time spent on the moving papers are both
reasonable. However, these motions are each relatively duplicative, at least in
the majority of the factual background, legal analysis, and sanctions sections.
Thus, taken together, the Court does not believe 2.5 hours per motion was
required. This Court nonetheless GRANTS Kohls’ requests for monetary sanctions
as against Plaintiff in the adjusted amount of $1,680 total, i.e., filing fees
plus $500 per motion.     
¿ 
IV. CONCLUSION  
¿¿ 
For the foregoing reasons,
Defendant’s Motions to Compel Responses from Plaintiff are GRANTED and are
ordered to be served, verified, code-compliant, and without objection on or
before April 19, 2024, and to produce responsive document identified or
required to be identified by that same date. Requests for Monetary Sanctions
are GRANTED in the amount of $1,680 as against Plaintiff to be paid to
Defendant on or before April 19, 2024.  
¿¿ 
Moving party is ordered to
give notice and to file proof of service of the notice of ruling.
