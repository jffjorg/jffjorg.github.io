And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the defendants' motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Interstate Cleaning Corporation (ICC) is granted. The defendants had filed the motion on January 10, 2024, and the plaintiff did not oppose it. The defendants seek to file a cross-complaint against ICC for alleged causes of action including equitable indemnity, contribution, apportionment, declaratory relief, express indemnity, and breach of contract. The Court finds that the proposed cross-complaint arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the cause of action filed against the defendants, and that granting the motion would be in the interest of justice. The Court also notes that permitting the cross-complaint to go forward in a single suit would enable all parties to have notice of proceedings and discovery in both the main action and the cross-action.
