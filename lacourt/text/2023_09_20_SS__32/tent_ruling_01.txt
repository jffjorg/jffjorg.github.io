BACKGROUND
 
            On July 19, 2019, Plaintiff
Joseph William Davison (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Luis
Manuel Zarate (“Zarate”), Universal Waste Systems, Inc., and Does 1 to 50,
inclusive, asserting two causes of action for (1) general negligence and (2)
motor vehicle. The Complaint alleges that on or about October 6, 2017, “Defendant
owned and/or operated his/her vehicle negligently and carelessly, proximately
causing property damage and personal injury to Plaintiff.” (Complaint, p. 4
(Attachment to Complaint).)
 
            On May 11, 2020, the Court ordered
this case (19STCV25342) and 19STCV34112 related within the meaning of
California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a). 
 
            On June 25, 2020, the Court ordered
the related cases consolidated, assigned them to Department 32 for all
purposes, and designated this case (19STCV25342) as the lead case. 
 
Defendants Universal Waste Systems, Inc. and Juan Manuel Zarate
(Defendants) now move to compel a mental examination of Plaintiff with Dean
Delis, PhD. on September 22, 2023 from 9:00 am to 5:30 pm, with a one-hour
lunch break.  Defendants also request
monetary sanctions. No opposition has been filed. 
 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“In any case in which a plaintiff is seeking recovery for
personal injuries, any defendant may demand one physical examination of the
plaintiff, if both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The
examination does not include any diagnostic test or procedure that is painful,
protracted, or intrusive. (2) The examination is conducted at a location within
75 miles of the residence of the examinee.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2032.220, subd.
(a).)¿ 
¿ 
“ “If any party desires to obtain discovery by a physical examination
other than that described in Article 2 (commencing with¿Section 2032.210), or
by a mental examination, the party shall obtain leave of court.” (Code Civ.
Proc., section 2032.310, subd. (a).) 
 
“A motion for an examination under subdivision (a) shall specify the
time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination, as well
as the identity and the specialty, if any, of the person or persons who will
perform the examination.” (Code Civ. Proc., section 2032.310, subd. (b).) 
 
“(a) The court shall grant a motion for a physical or mental
examination under Section 2032.310 only for good cause shown. . . . (d) An
order granting a physical or mental examination shall specify the person or
persons who may perform the examination, as well as the time, place, manner,
diagnostic tests and procedures, conditions, scope, and nature of the
examination.” (Id., § 2032.320, subds. (a), (d).) 
 
The examination will be limited
to whatever condition is “in controversy” in the action.  (Code Civ. Proc.
§2032.020(a).)  This means the examination must be directly related to the
specific injury or condition that is the subject of the litigation.  (Roberts
v. Superior Court (1973) 9 Cal.3d 330, 337.)  Often, a party's
pleadings put his or her mental or physical condition in controversy ... as
when a plaintiff claims continuing mental or physical injury resulting from
defendant's acts: “A party who chooses to allege that he has mental and
emotional difficulties can hardly deny his mental state is in
controversy.”  (See Vinson v. Superior Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833,
837, wherein the plaintiff claimed ongoing emotional distress from sexual
harassment by former employer.)  Discovery responses can also frame the
issues regarding the injuries and damages alleged. 
 
MEET AND CONFER
 
Defendants offer evidence that
Plaintiff’s counsel was initially agreeable to a mental examination, but then
stopped responding. (Price Decl. ¶ 5-9, Exh. B.) Therefore, Defendants have
satisfied the meet and confer requirement by making a reasonable and good faith
attempt. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendants argue that Plaintiff has put his mental condition at issue
by undergoing a brain scan and neuropsychological testing for a brain injury he
claims will result in a work demotion or early retirement. Defendants state
they served Plaintiff with a notice to appear for an examination with Dr. Delis
scheduled February 11, 2023, and that Plaintiff failed to appear. Defendants
served Plaintiff with a second amended notice for another examination on May 6,
2023. Plaintiff failed to appear again. On July 24, 2023, Defendants state they
served Plaintiff with a third amended notice of neurological examination for
September 22, 2023. Defendants filed a supplemental brief on August 2, 2023 that
included the Third Amended Notice of the Neuropsychological Exam for September
22, 2023. (Supp. Brief, Carrillo Decl., Exh. F.) The Notice includes the date,
time, and location of the exam, plus a list of the tests that may be performed.

 
The alleged car accident took place on October 6, 2017. In support of
the neuropsychological exam, Defendants offer that Plaintiff claims to have
suffered a traumatic brain injury, but that medical records show he only was
examined for an alleged traumatic brain injury one time on September 16, 2019
with Bruce Lasker, M.D. (Motion, Price Decl. ¶ 6, Exh. A; p. 110-14.)  Defendants state that in Plaintiff’s October
4, 2021 deposition, he testified that only Dr. Lasker had performed any
cognitive testing on him. (Motion, Exh. A; p. 110-14.) Additionally, on October
28, 2022, Defendants assert that they learned Plaintiff was undergoing
neuropsychological testing related to his alleged traumatic brain injury. (Motion,
Price Decl. ¶ 4.) On January 11, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel told Defendants’
counsel in a telephone call that Plaintiff was claiming a loss of future
earnings related to the brain injury. (Motion, Price Decl. ¶ 6.) Therefore, the
Court finds that Defendants have demonstrated good cause in ordering
Plaintiff’s mental examination.
 
Defendants request the following in sanctions against Plaintiff and
his attorney of record: $2,340.00 in attorney fees and $3,400.00 for the
February 11, 2023 examination cancellation fee. Regarding the cancellation fee,
in a personal injury case, a defendant is only entitled to one physical
examination by right. All mental examinations must be sought by leave of court,
if the parties do not agree. The emails Defendants attach show that Plaintiff never
fully committed to the February 2023 exam. (Price Decl., Exh. B.) However, they
do show that Plaintiff’s counsel stated he would review the notice, but never
followed through with Defendants’ counsel. (Price Decl. ¶ 5-9, Exh. B.) Therefore, the Court
finds that sanctions are warranted under Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.010 (i) against Plaintiff’s counsel for failing to confer in a reasonable
and good faith manner. Defendants’ counsel declares they worked thirteen hours
at an hourly rate of $180.00 to create $2,340.00 in fees for this motion.
(Carrillo Decl. ¶ 2.) The Court finds the amount to be excessive and awards
sanctions in the amount of $900 (5 hours of attorney time at $180.)
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 
Therefore, Defendants’ motion to compel Plaintiff’s mental examination
is GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to appear for examination with Dr. Dean Delis
on September 22, 2023.
 
Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, jointly and severally, are ordered
to pay $900 in sanctions to counsel for Defendants within 30 days.
 
Defendants to provide notice of the Court’s order and file a proof of
service of such.
