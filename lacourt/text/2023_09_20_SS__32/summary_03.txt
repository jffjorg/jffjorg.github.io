```
And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying Plaintiff Yi-Chuan Chang's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The motion seeks to remove Plaintiffs against whom this action has been summarily adjudicated, insert the name of the proper Plaintiff, correct the name of Defendant J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. to J.B. Hunt Transport, Inc., add a survival cause of action, and strike allegations that are irrelevant and/or that have been summarily adjudicated. The judge finds that the motion does not comply with California Rule of Court, rule 3.1324, and that the Plaintiff has not met the requirements of the rule. The judge also notes that the proposed amended complaint adds a punitive damages claim that was not mentioned in the motion, and permitting such an amendment will result in further delay and additional cost for the Defendants.

English text:
The tentative ruling for case number 20STCV46227, scheduled for hearing on September 20, 2023 in Dept 32, denies Plaintiff Yi-Chuan Chang's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The motion was made by Plaintiff as successor-in-interest to the estate of Te-Hsi Chang against Defendants Marco Antonio Luevano and J.B. Hunt Transport, Inc. The motion was opposed by Defendants.

In December 2020, Plaintiffs Te-Hsi Chang, Yi-Chuan Chang, and Chia-Yen Chang filed a negligence, negligent hiring/supervision, and wrongful death action based on an incident in which Defendantsâ€™ vehicle struck Decedent Chen Hsueh Chang at an intersection, resulting in Decedentâ€™s death. In May 2023, the Court granted in part Defendantsâ€™ motion for summary adjudication of certain causes of action, and the only cause of action that survived was the wrongful death cause of action brought by Yi-Chuan Chang, as successor in interest to Plaintiff Te-Hsi Chang.

Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint was made for several reasons, including removing Plaintiffs against whom the action has been summarily adjudicated, inserting the name of the proper Plaintiff, correcting the name of Defendant J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. to J.B. Hunt Transport, Inc., adding a survival cause of action, and striking allegations that are irrelevant and/or have been summarily adjudicated. Defendants oppose the motion on the grounds that Plaintiffâ€™s motion does not comply with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324, the statute of limitations on the survival action has run, Defendants will be prejudiced by a delay, and the amended complaint adds a punitive damages claim that was not mentioned in Plaintiffâ€™s motion.

The Court finds that Plaintiff has not met the requirements of California Rule of Court, rule 3.1324 (b) by not specifying why the amendment is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered, and the reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier. Additionally, Plaintiff has not followed California Rule of Court, rule 3.1324 (a) by not stating in the motion what allegations are proposed to be added to the previous pleading by page, paragraph, and line number. The late addition of a punitive damages claim will result in a delay of trial and additional discovery, and Plaintiff has not provided a declaration setting forth the information required by the California Rules of Court. Therefore, the Court denies Plaintiffâ€™s motion for leave to file a first amended complaint.
