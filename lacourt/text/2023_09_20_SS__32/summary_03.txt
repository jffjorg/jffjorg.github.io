"The Court concluded that Te-Hsi Chang had standing to file the wrongful death cause of action against Defendants for Decedent's death, and his wrongful death claim survived his own subsequent death via his successor in interest, Plaintiff Yi-Chuan Chang."
"The Court finds that Plaintiff has not met the requirements of California Rule of Court, rule 3.1324 (b)."
"The Court denies Plaintiffâ€™s motion for leave to file a first amended complaint."
```
And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying Plaintiff Yi-Chuan Chang's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint. The motion seeks to remove Plaintiffs against whom this action has been summarily adjudicated, insert the name of the proper Plaintiff, correct the name of Defendant J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. to J.B. Hunt Transport, Inc., add a survival cause of action, and strike allegations that are irrelevant and/or that have been summarily adjudicated. The judge finds that the motion does not comply with California Rule of Court, rule 3.1324, and that the Plaintiff has not met the requirements of the rule. The judge also notes that the proposed amended complaint adds a punitive damages claim that was not mentioned in the motion, and permitting such an amendment will result in further delay and additional cost for the Defendants.
