And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting summary judgment in favor of Target Corporation. The plaintiff, Gladys Sepedjian, filed a complaint against Target Corporation, Mario Rodriguez, and Does 1-100 for injuries allegedly caused by a ball in the aisle of Target's premises. Target moved for summary judgment, arguing that no triable issue of material fact exists and that there is no evidence that Target had actual or constructive notice of the alleged dangerous condition.

The judge found that Target has met its burden to show that there are no triable issues of fact. The evidence shows that the ball was on the floor for no more than 15 minutes, and that Target employee Alex Martinez conducted an inspection of the area 15 minutes before the fall and did not see any balls or hazards. The judge also noted that the plaintiff has no evidence to support her allegations that Target had constructive notice or actual notice.

The judge concluded that the burden now shifts to the plaintiff to produce evidence to establish a triable issue of material fact. Since the plaintiff has not produced any evidence, the judge granted summary judgment in favor of Target.
