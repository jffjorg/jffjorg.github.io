And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting summary judgment in favor of Target Corporation. The plaintiff, Gladys Sepedjian, filed a complaint against Target Corporation, Mario Rodriguez, and Does 1-100 for injuries allegedly caused by a ball in the aisle of Target's premises. Target moved for summary judgment, arguing that no triable issue of material fact exists and that there is no evidence that Target had actual or constructive notice of the alleged dangerous condition.

The judge found that Target has met its burden to show that there are no triable issues of fact. The evidence shows that the ball was on the floor for no more than 15 minutes, and that Target employee Alex Martinez conducted an inspection of the area 15 minutes before the fall and did not see any balls or hazards. The judge also noted that the plaintiff has no evidence to support her allegations that Target had constructive notice or actual notice.

The judge concluded that the burden now shifts to the plaintiff to produce evidence to establish a triable issue of material fact. Since the plaintiff has not produced any evidence, the judge granted summary judgment in favor of Target.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the evidence presented by Target Corporation and finds that there are no triable issues of fact. The court concludes that Target has met its burden to show that there was no triable issue of material fact, and that it is entitled to summary judgment.

The facts of the case are as follows: the plaintiff, Gladys Sepedjian, slipped on a ball and fell in the R17 area of the Subject Store on December 14, 2021. A Target employee, Alex Martinez, inspected the area 15 minutes before the fall and did not see any balls or hazards. The plaintiff has no evidence to support her allegations that Target had actual or constructive notice of the ball.

The court has considered the relevant California case law and finds that the time period of 15 minutes between the inspection and the fall is not sufficient to establish constructive notice. The court also finds that Target has provided sufficient evidence to show that its employee was trained to look for potential safety hazards and that the employee inspected the area 15 minutes before the fall.

Based on the foregoing, the court grants summary judgment in favor of Target Corporation. The court orders that Target provide notice of this ruling and file a proof of service of such.
