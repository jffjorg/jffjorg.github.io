And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is for a case number 21STCV14547, in which the plaintiff, Safeco Insurance Company of Illinois, is seeking to reopen the case. The case was originally filed on April 16, 2021, alleging that the defendants, All American Creations, LLC, and D. Vida Construction & Painting, Inc., were negligent in causing damage to the property of the plaintiff's insured, Robina Peanh. The case was previously dismissed on December 30, 2022, without prejudice, due to the plaintiff's failure to serve the defendants.

The plaintiff argues that the case should be reopened because they filed a declaration on December 1, 2022, requesting that the OSC hearing be vacated to allow for further attempts to serve the defendants, and that they did not receive notice of the court's disposition of said request. The plaintiff also asserts that they are unable to serve the defendants and are in a position to file an application for order to serve via publication.

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to reopen the case, citing a lack of legal authority and no attorney declaration regarding mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. However, the court notes that a delay of less than two years in service of the summons and complaint is not a ground for dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.410.

The court has set aside the December 30, 2022 dismissal and reinstated proceedings. The matter will be set for an Order to Show Cause Re: dismissal/monetary sanctions for failure to serve/ alternatively Trial Setting Conference for October 26, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. The plaintiff shall give notice of the court's order and file a proof of service of such.
