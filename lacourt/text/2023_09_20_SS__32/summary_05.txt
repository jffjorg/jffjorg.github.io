And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is for a case number 21STCV14547, in which the plaintiff, Safeco Insurance Company of Illinois, is seeking to reopen the case. The case was originally filed on April 16, 2021, alleging that the defendants, All American Creations, LLC, and D. Vida Construction & Painting, Inc., were negligent in causing damage to the property of the plaintiff's insured, Robina Peanh. The case was previously dismissed on December 30, 2022, without prejudice, due to the plaintiff's failure to serve the defendants.

The plaintiff argues that the case should be reopened because they filed a declaration on December 1, 2022, requesting that the OSC hearing be vacated to allow for further attempts to serve the defendants, and that they did not receive notice of the court's disposition of said request. The plaintiff also asserts that they are unable to serve the defendants and are in a position to file an application for order to serve via publication.

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to reopen the case, citing a lack of legal authority and no attorney declaration regarding mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. However, the court notes that a delay of less than two years in service of the summons and complaint is not a ground for dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.410.

The court has set aside the December 30, 2022 dismissal and reinstated proceedings. The matter will be set for an Order to Show Cause Re: dismissal/monetary sanctions for failure to serve/ alternatively Trial Setting Conference for October 26, 2023 at 8:30 a.m. The plaintiff shall give notice of the court's order and file a proof of service of such.

## English Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Safeco Insurance Company of Illinois v. All American Creations, LLC et al. The judge notes that the case was previously dismissed without prejudice because the Plaintiff was unable to serve the Defendants. The Plaintiff then filed a motion to reopen the case, but the judge denied this motion because it lacked legal basis and did not show excusable neglect.

The matter will be scheduled for either an Order to Show Cause hearing regarding dismissal or monetary sanctions for failure to serve, or a Trial Setting Conference.

### English Text Summary
The tentative ruling for case number 21STCV14547, set for hearing on September 20, 2023, in Department 32, involves a motion to reopen the case filed by Plaintiff Safeco Insurance Company of Illinois. The Plaintiff had filed a complaint on April 16, 2021, alleging negligence by Defendants All American Creations, LLC, and D. Vida Construction & Painting, Inc., causing damage to the property of Plaintiff's insured, Robina Peanh. However, the complaint was dismissed without prejudice on December 30, 2022, due to lack of appearance by counsel for Plaintiff and no proof of service.

The Plaintiff filed a motion to reopen the case on June 22, 2023, citing no legal authority and arguing that they did not receive notice of the Court's disposition of their request to vacate the OSC hearing. The Court notes that the motion does not provide any attorney declaration regarding mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b).

Despite denying the motion to reopen the case, the Court sets aside the December 30, 2022 dismissal and reinstates proceedings, as the complaint had been filed less than two years prior, which is not a ground for dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure section 583.410.

  - "A delay of less than two years in service of the summons and complaint is not a ground for dismissal under [Code of Civil Procedure section 583.410]."

**Judge's Tentative Ruling Summary**

The judge has issued a tentative ruling for the hearing on September 20, 2023, in the case 21STCV14547. The plaintiff, Safeco Insurance Company of Illinois, filed a "Motion to Reopen the Case" after their complaint was dismissed without prejudice. However, the motion lacked legal authority or attorney declaration regarding mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Therefore, the motion was denied.

The judge noted that the complaint was filed less than two years prior to dismissal, and a delay of less than two years in service of the summons and complaint is not a ground for dismissal. The Court set aside the December 30, 2022 dismissal and reinstated proceedings, scheduling an Order to Show Cause Re: dismissal/monetary sanctions for failure to serve/alternatively Trial Setting Conference for October 26, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. Plaintiff is required to give notice of the Court's order and file a proof of service.
