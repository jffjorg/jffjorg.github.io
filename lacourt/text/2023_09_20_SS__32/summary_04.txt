```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the Plaintiff's motion and the Defendant's Reply. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff failed to properly plead negligence and negligent supervision claims, and that the Plaintiff's failure to seek leave to cure the defect is unreasonable. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff was notified of the potential survival action by the Defendant's counsel, but did not take any action until the filing of the instant motion. The Judge is concerned that the Plaintiff's failure to properly plead the claims may result in a new motion for summary adjudication, which would delay the trial. The Judge is seeking to clarify the Plaintiff's intentions regarding the survival action and to ensure that the Defendant has an opportunity to address any potential claims.

## English Summary

The judge is considering a motion filed by the Plaintiff. The judge believes the motion may be defective because Plaintiff did not follow the California Rules of Court.  

The judge also notes that Plaintiff was notified back in March 2022 that their pleading might not be correct regarding a specific legal claim (Survival Cause of Action). Plaintiff did not take action until recently, leading to delays in the case.

The judge is concerned that Plaintiff's delay may have unfairly prejudiced the Defendants. The judge will likely rule on the motion at the upcoming hearing.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is critical of the plaintiff's response to the motion, which fails to adequately address the issues raised and ignores the plaintiff's responsibility to abide by the Rules of Court. The plaintiff was previously notified of the need to plead a survival cause of action, but failed to take action until filing the instant motion. This has resulted in a delay in the litigation and may require a new motion for summary adjudication. The judge notes that the plaintiff's failure to seek leave to cure the defect is inexplicable, given that counsel was notified of the issue.
