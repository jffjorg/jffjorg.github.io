And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the Plaintiff's motion and the Defendant's Reply. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff failed to properly plead negligence and negligent supervision claims, and that the Plaintiff's failure to seek leave to cure the defect is unreasonable. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff was notified of the potential survival action by the Defendant's counsel, but did not take any action until the filing of the instant motion. The Judge is concerned that the Plaintiff's failure to properly plead the claims may result in a new motion for summary adjudication, which would delay the trial. The Judge is seeking to clarify the Plaintiff's intentions regarding the survival action and to ensure that the Defendant has an opportunity to address any potential claims.
