Reply further argues that “[t]o the extent any issue not adequately addressed
in the Motion that is required by the Rules of Court, it can and will be addressed
at the hearing on the instant Motion.” (Reply at pg. 2.) This response ignores
Plaintiff’s responsibility to abide by the Rules of Court as well as the
opposing party’s right to notice of the arguments that will be raised. Moreover,
the Reply inexplicably fails to seek leave the cure the defect, even after
counsel was notified by the opposition of the failure to abide by the
California Rules of Court.


[2] Plaintiff
was expressly notified on March 3, 2022 by counsel for Defendants that: “It
seems possible, if not probable, that Plaintiffs meant not to plead negligence
and negligent supervision claims for the conduct of defendants that affected
each individual Plaintiff, but rather to make those claims on behalf of the
Decedent. If that is true, Plaintiffs meant to make a Survival Cause of Action
on behalf of the Decedent’s Estate pursuant to California Code of Civil
Procedure § 377.20 et seq. However, Plaintiffs, as a technical legal matter,
did not and have not done so to date.” (Smith Decl., Exh. B.) Yet no action was
taken by Plaintiff until June 15, 2023, when the instant motion was filed. In
the interim, Defendants litigated a motion for summary judgment/ summary
adjudication, without the opportunity to address any purported survival action,
because Plaintiff still had not given any indication that such a claim would be
pursued. Plaintiff provides no explanation. Defendant argues that a new motion
for summary adjudication will need to be pursued, which will result in a delay
of the trial.
