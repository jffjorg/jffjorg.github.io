1.      Shil K. Park’s Demurrer to First Amended
Cross-Complaint  
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Shil K. Park’s Demurrer to First
Amended Cross-Complaint is overruled, in part, and sustained with 20 days leave
to amend, in part.
 
Background
 
Plaintiff filed the Complaint on December 21, 2022. Plaintiff
alleges the following facts. Defendant breached the commercial lease agreement
by failing to pay the full rent. Plaintiff alleged a cause of action for Breach
of Contract. 
 
Defendant filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint.
Cross-Complainant alleges that Cross-Defendant breached the lease by refusing
to make the repairs required by the lease and by interfering with
Cross-Complainant’s use of the premises. Cross-Defendant also harassed and
retaliated against Cross-Complainant. Cross-Complainant alleges the following
causes of action: 1. Breach of Contract; 2. Rescission; 3. Breach of the
Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment; 4. Partial Eviction; 5. Violation of Sec. 8.45.050
of the L.A. County Anti-Harassment and Retaliation Ordinance; 6. Violation of §
1170-20 of the City of Lawndale Ordinance.  
 
Meet and
Confer
 
Cross-Defendant set forth a meet and confer
declaration in sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41.  (Decl., Lane Nussbaum.)
 
Demurrer
 
A demurrer tests the
sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law and raises only questions of law.
(Schmidt v. Foundation Health (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In testing the sufficiency of the complaint,
the court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual
allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly
pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.)  The Court may not
consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.App.4th
634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint, the
plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to establish
every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw
v. California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.)  Where the complaint fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.
 (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County
of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
 
Sufficient facts are
the essential facts of the case "with reasonable precision and with
particularity sufficiently specific to acquaint the defendant with the nature,
source, and extent of his cause of action.”  (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193
Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.) "Whether
the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling
upon the demurrer."  (Stevens v.
Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.)  Under Code Civil Procedure § 430.10(f), a
demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is “uncertain.” Uncertainty exists where a complaint’s factual
allegations are so confusing, they do not sufficiently apprise a defendant of
the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams
v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
 
Cross-Defendant demurs
to the First Amended Cross-Complaint and each of the first through sixth causes
of action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 430.10(e)(f), on the
ground that the causes of action fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action and the causes of action are uncertain. 
 
First Cause of
Action for Breach of Contract
 
Cross-Defendant’s
demurrer to the first cause of action is overruled. Cross-Complainant states
facts sufficient to state a cause of action. 
“The elements of a cause of
action for breach of contract are: (1) the contract, (2) plaintiff's
performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the
resulting damages to plaintiff.” Coles v.
Glaser (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 384, 391(internal quotations omitted). “[T]he
complaint must indicate on its face whether the contract is written, oral, or
implied by conduct. [...] If the action is based on an alleged breach of a
written contract, the terms must be set out verbatim in the body of the
complaint or a copy of the written instrument must be attached and incorporated
by reference.” Otworth v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co. (1985) 166
Cal.App.3d 452, 458–59.
Cross-Complainant has
stated sufficient facts to meet the elements of the cause of action and has
attached a copy of the written agreement. Cross-Complainant alleges that the
parties entered into a lease agreement. Cross-Complainant alleges that it
performed the agreement or was excused from performing. Cross-Complainant
alleges a breach of the agreement by Cross-Defendant failing to make repairs
and by interfering with access to the property. Cross-Complainant alleges
resulting damages.  (FACC, ¶¶ 5-22.) 
 
Cross-Defendant
argues that certain warranties may not apply in this action, specifically those
set forth in paragraph 2 of the lease. However, the applicability and viability
of certain warranties and terms of the agreement are dependent upon factual
issues that cannot be adjudicated with a demurrer.  Cross-Complainant appears to set forth
allegations against Cross-Defendant that may not be encompassed within the
specific warranty provision of paragraph 2.  Cross-Defendant also argues that certain
required notices were not provided by Cross-Complainant.  However, again, a determination as to these
arguments would require the consideration of factual issues that are not
appropriate with a demurrer.
 
The demurrer to the
first cause of action is overruled.
 
Second Cause of
Action for Rescission
 
Cross-Defendant’s demurrer
to the second cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
Cross-Complainant fails to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action. 
 
Civ. Code, § 1689 states:
“(a) A contract may be rescinded if all the parties
thereto consent.
(b) A party to a
contract may rescind the contract in the following cases:
(1) If the consent of
the party rescinding, or of any party jointly contracting with him, was given
by mistake, or obtained through duress, menace, fraud, or undue influence,
exercised by or with the connivance of the party as to whom he rescinds, or of any
other party to the contract jointly interested with such party.
(2) If the
consideration for the obligation of the rescinding party fails, in whole or in
part, through the fault of the party as to whom he rescinds.
(3) If the
consideration for the obligation of the rescinding party becomes entirely void
from any cause.
(4) If the
consideration for the obligation of the rescinding party, before it is rendered
to him, fails in a material respect from any cause.
(5) If the contract
is unlawful for causes which do not appear in its terms or conditions, and the
parties are not equally at fault.
(6) If the public
interest will be prejudiced by permitting the contract to stand.
(7) Under the
circumstances provided for in Sections 39, 1533, 1566, 1785,1 1789,2
1930 and 2314 of this code, Section 2470 of the Corporations Code,3
Sections 331, 338, 359, 447, 1904 and 2030 of the Insurance Code or any other
statute providing for rescission.”
 
“A party who sues for
breach of contract thereby affirms the contract's existence, and the damages
awarded “compensate[ ] the party not in default for the loss of his
‘expectational interest’—the benefit of his bargain which full performance
would have brought.” (Runyan, supra, 2 Cal.3d at p. 316, fn. 15, 85
Cal.Rptr. 138, 466 P.2d 682.) In contrast, rescission is a remedy that disaffirms
the contract. (Akin, at p. 296, 44 Cal.Rptr.3d 284; see also Lobdell
v. Miller, supra, 114 Cal.App.2d at p. 343, 250 P.2d 357 [“The remedy of
rescission necessarily involves a repudiation of the contract”].) Rescission
extinguishes the contract (Civ.Code, § 1688), terminates further liability, and
restores the parties to their former positions by requiring them to return whatever
consideration they have received. (Nmsbpcsldhb v. County of Fresno
(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 954, 959–960, 61 Cal.Rptr.3d 425.) Thus, the “[r]elief
given in rescission cases—restitution and in some cases consequential
damages—puts the rescinding party in the status quo ante, returning him
to his economic position before he entered the contract.” Sharabianlou v.
Karp (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 1133, 1144–1145.
 
Here,
Cross-Complainant has failed to allege facts to establish a ground for
rescission as stated in Civ. Code § 1689. In addition, Cross-Complainant has
failed to allege facts to establish a valid remedy pursuant to rescission. The
alleged damages appear to repeat the same damages set forth in the Breach of
Contract cause of action. 
 
The demurrer to the
second cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Third Cause of
Action for Breach of the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment
Cross-Defendant’s demurrer to
the third cause of action is overruled. Cross-Complainant states facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action and the cause of action is not
uncertain.
“[E]very lease contains
an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, whereby the landlord impliedly
covenants that the tenant shall have quiet enjoyment and possession of the
premises. The covenant of quiet enjoyment insulates the tenant against any act
or omission on the part of the landlord, or anyone claiming under him, which
interferes with a tenants right to use and enjoy the premises for the purposes
contemplated by the tenancy. [...] To be actionable, the landlords act or
omission must substantially interfere with a tenants (sic) right to use and
enjoy the premises for the purposes contemplated by the tenancy.” Andrews v.
Mobile Aire Estates (2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 578, 588–89 (internal citations
and quotations omitted; emphasis in original).
Cross-Complainant alleged
sufficient facts to meet each of the elements of the cause of action.  (FACC, ¶¶ 31-39.)  Essentially, the alleged facts of the breach
noted above are restated to support grounds for the alleged disturbance with
quiet enjoyment.
The demurrer to the third cause
of action is overruled.
Fourth Cause of Action for
Partial Eviction
Cross-Defendant’s demurrer to
the fourth cause of action for “Partial Eviction” is sustained with 20 days
leave to amend. Cross-Complainant fails to state facts sufficient to state a
cause of action and the cause of action is uncertain.
“An eviction is actual when a
landlord takes direct action to physically expel the tenant from the premises.
An eviction is constructive if the landlord engages in acts that render the
premises unfit for occupancy for the purpose for which it was leased, or
deprive the tenant of the beneficial enjoyment of the premises.” Cunningham
v. Universal Underwriters (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1152.
“[A]ny disturbance of the
tenant's possession by the lessor or at his procurement ... which has the
effect of depriving the tenant of the beneficial enjoyment of the premises,
amounts to a constructive eviction, provided the tenant vacates the premises within
a reasonable time. [Citations.]” (Id. at pp. 612–613, 272 P.2d 938; see Kulawitz
v. Pacific Woodenware & Paper Co. (1945) 25 Cal.2d 664, 670, 155 P.2d
24 [“Any interference by the landlord by which the tenant is deprived of the
beneficial enjoyment of the premises amounts to a constructive eviction if the
tenant so elects and surrenders possession, and the tenant will not be liable
for rentals for the portion of the term following his eviction.
[Citations.]”].) The Supreme Court stated in Standard Live Stock Co. v.
Pentz (1928) 204 Cal. 618, 625, 269 P. 645, that “the covenant of quiet
possession in a lease is not breached until there has been an actual or
constructive eviction.” Nevertheless, some authorities recognize that a tenant
may sue for breach of the covenant while remaining in possession.” Nativi v.
Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 261, 292.
The legal principle of
constructive eviction or partial constructive eviction is sound. However,
Cross-Complainant has failed to demonstrate any legal authority to establish
that this principle provides a separate remedy at law than that which would be
provided with a cause of action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment,
or, that the fourth cause of action is a separate and distinct cause of action
from the third cause of action.
Therefore, the demurrer to the
fourth cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
Fifth Cause of Action for
Violation of Sec. 8.45.050 of the L.A. County Anti-Harassment and Retaliation
Ordinance
Cross-Defendant’s demurrer to
the fifth cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. In the
opposition to the demurrer, Cross-Complainant appears to acknowledge the need
to allege additional facts that would support Cross-Complainant’s contention
that this ordinance applies retroactively, and, thus, that it would be
applicable to the allegations in this cause of action.
Thus, the demurrer to the fifth
cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
Violation of § 1170-20 of
the City of Lawndale Ordinance
Cross-Defendant’s demurrer to
the sixth cause of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
Cross-Complainant fails to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action.
Cross-Complainant has failed to
set forth facts to establish that City of Lawndale Ordinance Section 1170-20
provides for a legal right of action and/or remedies or penalties. Subsection e
of the ordinance states: “The violation of this Ordinance shall be punishable
as a misdemeanor as set forth in Section 1.08.020 of the Lawndale Municipal
Code. In addition, this Ordinance grants a defense in the event that an
unlawful detainer action is commenced in violation of this Ordinance.” The
Court is not aware of any other remedies or penalties set forth in this
ordinance.
The demurrer to the sixth cause
of action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
The Court further notes that if
any future demurrers are filed the parties are to request judicial notice of
any relevant ordinances and attach a full copy of any relevant ordinances to
the demurrer and/or opposition.
Cross-Defendant is ordered to
give notice of this ruling.
