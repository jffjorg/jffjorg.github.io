And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that Irma Hernandez Mata, et al.'s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions is partly moot, partly denied, and partly granted. The motion is moot as to some of the requests because Defendant has already served further responses. As to Requests 17 and 18, the motion is either granted or moot, depending on whether the documents have already been produced. The Judge orders Defendant to serve further responses to these requests within 10 days if they have not already been served. The motion is denied as to Requests 37 to 41, which are deemed overly broad. The Judge denies Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions.
