CASE:                         Lenny K. Dykstra v. Galanter Associates,
et al.
 
CASE NO.:                 23STCV03186            
 
MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff Lenny K. Dykstra.
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): Defendant Douglas
F. Galanter, individually and d/b/a Galanter Associates
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a legal malpractice action that was filed on February 14, 2023.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to provide adequate and competent legal
services, failed to communicate with Plaintiff during the course of
representation, and misappropriated funds which were to be held in an Interest on
Lawyer’s Trust Account for the benefit of Plaintiff. 
 
Plaintiff moves for summary
judgment. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff purports to move for
summary judgment on his claims against Defendant. 
 
Defendant objects to the
Declaration of Lenny Dykstra filed in support of this motion. For the reasons
discussed below, however, that declaration is not material to the Court’s
ruling, and the Court therefore declines to rule on Defendant’s objections.
(See Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(q).) 
 
There are numerous procedural
defects in the moving papers filed by Plaintiff.  He did not file or serve a Notice of Motion,
as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1010 and Rule of Court
3.1350(c), setting forth the time, date and place of hearing, the order or
judgment sought, the grounds for the motion, or the materials relied upon.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1010; Cal. Rule of Court 3.1350(c).) Plaintiff also did not
identify the causes of action or defenses to which the motion is directed. (Sequoia
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (Norden) (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1472, 1478.) 
 
Further, Plaintiff did not provide
a Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts, as required by Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c subdivision (b)(1), the contents of which are described,
in detail, in Rule of Court 3.1350(d). (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(b)(1); Cal. Rule
of Court 3.1350(d).) The failure to comply with this requirement is independent
grounds for denial of the motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(b)(1).) 
 
Because of these serious procedural
defects and failure to properly give notice or identify the basis for the
motion, Plaintiff is not entitled to summary judgment. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion for
Summary Judgment is DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
