And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Lenny K. Dykstra, filed a legal malpractice action against the defendant, Douglas F. Galanter, alleging that the defendant failed to provide adequate and competent legal services, failed to communicate with the plaintiff, and misappropriated funds. The plaintiff moved for summary judgment, but the judge found that the moving papers had numerous procedural defects, including the failure to file or serve a notice of motion, identify the causes of action or defenses, and provide a separate statement of undisputed material facts. The judge also found that the plaintiff's declaration was not material to the court's ruling. As a result, the judge denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.
