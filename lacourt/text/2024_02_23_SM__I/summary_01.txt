And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting a plaintiff's unopposed motion for terminating sanctions against a defendant. The defendant has refused to appear for his deposition despite a previous court order to do so. The court finds that the defendant has stopped participating in the case and has ignored his discovery obligations. The court notes that it would have considered a lesser sanction if the defendant had opposed the motion, but the lack of opposition suggests that the defendant is intentionally ignoring the court's orders. The court grants the motion, strikes the defendant's answer, and directs the plaintiff not to seek a default for 15 days. The court allows the defendant to reinstate his answer if he moves to do so. The court also specifies that the jurisdictional maximum judgment is $25,001, and that the plaintiff must file and serve a statement of damages before seeking a default judgment exceeding that amount.
