And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to compel arbitration, finding that the arbitration agreement is binding and that the plaintiff's standing must be arbitrated. The Judge concludes that the plaintiff's allegation of a PAGA claim does not prevent the arbitration of the individual claim, citing case law and the Federal Arbitration Act. The Judge also finds that the defendant has not waived arbitration and that the arbitration agreement is not unconscionable. The Judge stays the court proceedings pending the outcome of the arbitration, ordering a status conference in approximately 270 days to ensure the arbitration is proceeding.
