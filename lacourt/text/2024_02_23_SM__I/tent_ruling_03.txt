 Case Number:  23SMCV04614    Hearing Date:   February 23, 2024    Dept:  I The demurrer is STRICKEN. 
First, defendant cannot demur to the action because defendant is in
default.  Until and unless the default is
lifted, this motion cannot be filed. 
Second, a demurrer must be noticed for hearing not more than 35 days
after filing.  The court is aware that
sometimes its calendar does not permit a filing that soon (although usually the
court can hear the demurrer within that time frame), but here the motion was
filed on October 26, 2023—a staggering 123 days before the reserved hearing
date.  That is not due to the court’s
calendar.  The demurrer is therefore
improper for over-long notice.
