         vs.

 Case No.:  BC682984 
 
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  July 12, 2024



 
Plaintiff Massachusetts Educational
Financing Authority’s unopposed motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement
is granted.
Plaintiff is to submit a judgment to
this Court within 10 days of this ruling.
 
          Plaintiff
Massachusetts Education Financing Authority (“MEFA”) (“Plaintiff”) moves unopposed
for an order to enter judgment because Defendant Alexander L Ross (“Ross”)
(“Defendant”) defaulted on the terms and conditions of the parties’ settlement
stipulation.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 1;
C.C.P. §664.6.)
 
          Background
          On November 09,
2017, Plaintiff filed a Complaint in this Court for damages in the amount of $25,149.19
to recover the unpaid balance on a credit card account.  (Decl. of Rohan ¶2.)  
On March 22, 2022, Plaintiff and Defendant executed a settlement
agreement (“Settlement Agreement”), with the Court retaining jurisdiction to
enforce the terms of the agreement.  (Decl. of Rohan ¶3, Exh. A.)  Pursuant to ¶10 of the agreement, if
Defendant defaulted under the Settlement Agreement, then Plaintiff could obtain
a judgment for the outstanding balance, pre-judgment interest and costs through
declaration and order.  (See Decl.
of Rohan ¶¶3-4, Exh. A at ¶10.)
On February 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion.  As of the date of this hearing no opposition
has been filed by Defendant.
 
          Motion to Enforce Settlement
          Legal Standard
C.C.P. §664.6 provides, as
follows: “If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by
the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for
settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter
judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties,
the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement
until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.”  (C.C.P. §664.6(a).)
Disputes regarding the terms
of the settlement (or other disputed facts) may be adjudicated on a C.C.P.
§664.6 motion on the basis of declarations or other evidence.  (Malouf Brothers v. Dixon (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d
280, 284; Machado v. Myers (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 779, 795-796 [stating court
may resolve reasonable disputes over terms of settlement agreement but may not
modify terms from what was agreed to by parties].) 
 
          Discussion
Plaintiff submitted evidence that
Plaintiff and Defendant executed a Settlement Agreement that is signed by the
parties and contains a provision authorizing this Court to retain jurisdiction
under C.C.P. §664.6.  (Decl. of Rohan ¶2,
Exh. A.)  Accordingly, Plaintiff submitted
evidence of the existence of a valid settlement agreement and is therefore entitled
to an order enforcing the settlement. 
Plaintiff’s counsel declares
Defendant last made a payment on September 9, 2014.  (Decl. of Rohan ¶4.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares that on March
16, 2023, he last sent a cure letter to Defendant, stating that Defendant had
ten days to cure the defect.  (Decl.
of Rohan ¶6.)  Plaintiff’s
counsel declares Defendant did not cure the defect and Defendant has not made
any other payments pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement.  (Decl. of Rohan ¶¶6-7.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares the principal outstanding
balance on Defendant’s account is $10,552.09. 
(Decl. of Rohan ¶8.)  Plaintiff
requests a judgment against Defendant in the amount of $11,073.93, reflecting a
principal balance of $25,149.19, less $14,075.26 in credits for payments made,
and $0.00 in costs.
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s
motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement and enter judgment against
Defendant in the amount of $11,073.93, reflecting a principal balance of
$25,149.19, less $14,075.26 in credits for payments made, and $0.00 in costs is
granted.

 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s unopposed
motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement and enter judgment against Defendant
in the amount of $11,073.93, reflecting a principal balance of $25,149.19, less
$14,075.26 in credits for payments made, and $0.00 in costs is granted.
Plaintiff is to submit a
judgment to the Court within 10 days of this ruling.
Moving Party to give notice.
