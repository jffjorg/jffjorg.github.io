And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to bifurcate trial filed by Plaintiffs Craig Nelson and Stacy Nelson. The motion seeks to separate the trial of the Plaintiffs' claims for damages against Defendant Mike Brown from the trial of the Defendant's Cross-Claim for indemnity. The judge finds that the ends of justice necessitate hearing the issue of Mike Brown's express indemnity cause of action before the trial on Plaintiffs' claims. The judge believes that a bench trial determining the express indemnity issue would require few witnesses and would take up very little time, promoting judicial economy. Therefore, the judge grants the motion to bifurcate trial.
