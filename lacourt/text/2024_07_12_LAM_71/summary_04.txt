Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority (MEFA) has moved unopposed for an order to enter judgment against Alexander L. Ross (Ross) due to his default on the terms of their settlement agreement. The agreement was executed on March 22, 2022, and provided for the court to retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the agreement. Ross has failed to make any payments under the agreement since his last payment on September 9, 2014. The court finds that MEFA is entitled to an order enforcing the settlement agreement and entering judgment against Ross in the amount of $11,073.93, reflecting a principal balance of $25,149.19, less $14,075.26 in credits for payments made. MEFA is to submit a judgment to the court within 10 days of this ruling.
