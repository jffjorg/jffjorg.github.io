          Petitioner
Blue Bear Waste Services, LLC (“Blue Bear”) (“Petitioner”) petitions this Court
to confirm the contractual arbitration award issued in its favor and against
Respondent Bond Enterprises, Inc., dba Bond Consulting Services (“Bond”)
(“Respondent”).  (See Petition,
pg. 1.)
          Petitioner
demurs to Respondent’s Answer to Petitioner’s Petition on the basis
Respondent’s Answer is untimely and fails to state any viable defenses which
Respondent is permitted to raise by the California Arbitration Act.  (Notice Demurrer, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §§430.20,
431.30, 1280-1288.8.) 
 
Background
This dispute arises from Respondent’s agreement
to develop software for Petitioner in exchange for payment, subject to certain
terms and conditions of the agreement.  (See
Petition ¶5.)  Respondent did
not develop the software it agreed to develop, did not notify Petitioner of
problems that arise as required by the agreement, and did not provide a source
code to the Petitioner as agreed. (See Petition ¶5.)  Petitioner and Respondent agreed to binding
arbitration on January 31, 2022 (“Agreement”). 
(Petition ¶¶4(a), (c); Exh. A at ¶32.)
The Arbitration hearing occurred from
January 9 to 12, 2024, before Arbitrator Janice L. Sperow, AAA, in a remote
hearing from Fresno, California. 
(Petition ¶¶6-7.)  Arbitrator Sperow
issued the Final Arbitration Award on March 25, 2024.  (Petition ¶8; Attachment 8c.) 
Petitioner filed the instant petition to
confirm the arbitration award on April 8, 2024. 
Respondent filed an opposition on July 5, 2024.
Petitioner filed the instant demurrer on May
21, 2024.  Respondent filed its
opposition on July 1, 2024.  Petitioner
filed its reply on July 5, 2024.
 
A.   Motion to Confirm Arbitration Award
Arbitration Award
          The party
seeking judicial enforcement of a private arbitration award has the burden of proving
the award as well as the existence of a valid arbitration agreement.  (Toal v. Tardif (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th
1208, 1223 [holding burden not met by submitting copy of contract with
arbitration provision signed by party’s attorney rather than by party
personally].)
The specific grounds upon which an arbitrator’s award may
be vacated are set forth in C.C.P. §1286.2.  Except for such grounds, arbitration awards
are immune from judicial review.  (See
Moncharsh v. Heily & Blase (1992) 3 Cal.4th 1, 10-11 [limiting grounds for
judicial review effectuates the parties’ agreement that the award be final and
also reflects that arbitrators need not follow the law and may base their
decisions on “broad principles of justice and equity . . . paths neither marked
nor traceable by judicial review”].)  Generally,
errors of law committed by the arbitrator are not grounds for challenging the
arbitration award.  (Id. at pg.
11.)  The sufficiency of evidence to
support the award is immaterial and courts cannot review the same.  (See Morris v. Zuckerman (1968) 69
Cal.2d. 686, 691.)  Courts cannot pass
upon the validity of the arbitrator’s reasoning and cannot substitute its
judgment for that of the arbitrator.  (See
Moncharsh, 3 Cal.4th at pg. 11.)
          Petitioner
has met its burden to prove the arbitration award and the existence of a valid
arbitration agreement.  (Petition ¶¶4(a), (c); Attachments 4(b) at
¶7; Petition ¶8(c), Attachment 8c.)  
          The
final arbitration award awards the following:
1.     For
claimant on the First Cause of Action for Breach of Contract in the amount of $188,682.75;
1.     For
claimant on the First Cause of Action for Breach of Contract based on Breach of
the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing in the amount already stated;
2.     For
claimant on the Second Cause of Action for Negligence in the amount of $688,480.24 based upon respondent’s professional
negligence and in the amount already stated;
3.     The
Arbitrator dismisses with prejudice claimant’s Second Cause of Action for Negligence
as a matter of law under the Economic Loss Rule to the extent claimant based it
upon economic losses stemming from respondent’s failure to satisfy its
contractual duties;
4.     For
claimant on the Third Cause of Action for Negligent Misrepresentation in the
amounts already stated;
5.     For
respondent on the Third Cause of Action for Negligent Misrepresentation to the
extent claimant based its claim upon respondent’s predictions, statements, and
opinions regarding future events;
6.     The
Arbitrator dismisses with prejudice claimant’s Third Cause of Action for
Negligent Misrepresentation as a matter of law under the Economic Loss Rule to
the extent claimant based its claim upon economic losses caused by respondent’s
misrepresentations stemming from its contractual duties;
7.     For
claimant on the Fourth Cause of Action for Fraudulent Misrepresentation in the amount
of $116,256.49 and the amounts already stated based upon
respondent’s misrepresentations stemming from independent duties;
8.     For
respondent on the Fourth Cause of Action for Fraudulent Misrepresentation to
the extent claimant based its claim upon respondent’s predictions, statement,
and opinions regarding future events;
9.     The
Arbitrator dismisses with prejudice claimant’s Fourth Cause of Action for
Fraudulent Misrepresentation as a matter of law under the Economic Loss Rule to
the extent claimant based its claim upon economic losses caused by respondent’s
misrepresentations stemming from its contractual duties;
10. For
respondent on claimant’s Fifth Cause of Action for Fraudulent Nondisclosure;
11. For
respondent on claimant’s Sixth Cause of Action for Fraudulent Concealment;
12. For
claimant on the Seventh Cause of Action for Conversion in the amounts already stated;
13. For
respondent on the Eighth Cause of Action for Civil Theft;
14. For
claimant on Ninth Cause of Action for Misappropriation of Trade Secrets in the amounts
already stated;
15. For
claimant on its request for attorney fees in the amount of $242,046.00
16. For
claimant on its request for sanctions in an amount subsumed by claimant’s
attorney fees;
17. For
claimant on its request for costs in the amount of $108,783.27;
18. For
claimant on its request for pre-judgment interest on its First Cause of Action
in an amount already subsumed by claimant’s breach of contract damages
19. For
respondent on claimant’s request for pre-judgment interest on claimant’s
remaining claims;
20. For
respondent on claimant’s request for punitive damages;
21. For
respondent on the request for civil penalties and treble damages;
22. For
claimant on its request for post-award interest at 8% per annum as to the
entire amount of the Final Award from the date of the Final Award; and
23. For
claimant on claimant’s request for injunctive relief as modified and set forth
above.
 
Claimant is the
prevailing party in this matter. The administrative fees and expenses of the American
Arbitration Association totaling $16,475.00 shall be borne $16,475.00 by Bond Enterprises,
Inc. dba Bond Consulting Service, and the compensation and expenses of the Arbitrator
totaling $103,125.00 shall be borne $103,125.00 by Bond Enterprises, Inc. dba
Bond Consulting Service. Therefore, Bond Enterprises, Inc. dba Bond Consulting
Service must pay Blue Bear Waste Service, LLC, an amount of $67,887.50.
 
This Final Award amends
and supersedes the Second Interim Award dated March 2, 2024, and the initial
Interim Award dated January 24, 2024, in their entirety.
 
This Final Award is in
full settlement of all claims submitted in this arbitration. All claims not expressly
granted herein are hereby denied. This final award resolves all issues between
all parties and represents the final adjudication of all claims and defenses
between the parties.
 
(Petition, Attachment 8(c) at pgs. 102-103.)
          The
Court determines the Petition is proper. 
Accordingly, the Court confirms the award and enters judgment according
to it.  Petitioner is
awarded the award against Respondent in the amount of $993,419.48, post-judgment
interest at 8% per annum from March 25, 2024 ($23,733.20), attorneys’ fees in
the amount of $242,046.00, costs in the amount of $108,783.27, and administrative fees in the amount of $67,887.50, for the total amount of $1,435,869.45 less
any amounts of the award Respondent has already paid to Petitioner prior to
this ruling.

 
Conclusion
Petitioner’s
petition to confirm the Arbitration Award is granted.  Petitioner is awarded the award against Respondent in the principal
amount of $993,419.48, post-judgment interest at 8% per annum from March 25,
2024 ($23,733.20), attorneys’ fees in the amount of $242,046.00, costs in the
amount of $108,783.27, and administrative fees in the amount of $67,887.50, for
the total amount of $1,435,869.45, less any amounts of the award Respondent has
already paid to Petitioner prior to this ruling.

Moving Party to give
notice.

 
B.   
Demurrer to
Respondent’s Answer
          Meet and Confer
Before filing a
demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer
in person, by telephone, or by video conference with the party who filed
the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether
an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in
the demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a),
emphasis added.)  A declaration must be
filed with a demurrer regarding the results of the meet and confer process.  (C.C.P. §430.41(a)(3).)
Petitioner’s
counsel declares he attempted to meet and confer telephonically with Defendant’s
counsel on May 20, 2024, and there was no answer, so he left a voicemail
indicating Petitioner’s intent to file the instant demurrer.  (Decl. of Cooledge
¶2.)  Petitioner’s counsel
declares he has not heard back from Respondent’s counsel.  (Decl. of Cooledge ¶2.)  Petitioner’s counsel’s declaration is
sufficient under C.C.P. §430.41(a). 
Accordingly, the Court will consider the instant demurrer.
 
Summary of
Demurrer
Petitioner demurs
to Respondent’s Answer to the Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award on the
basis the Answer is untimely and fails to state any viable defenses that
Respondent can raise under the California Arbitration Act.  (Notice of Demurrer, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§430.20,
431.30, 1280-1288.8.)
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Insurance Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider
declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted
for the truth of their contents].)  
A demurrer to an answer may be brought on any of the following grounds:
(a) the answer does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a defense; (b) the answer is uncertain, meaning ambiguous and
unintelligible; or (c) where the answer pleads a contract, it cannot be
ascertained from the answer whether the contract is written or oral.  (C.C.P. §430.20.)
          
          Failure to State a Claim
          Entire Answer
Petitioner demurs
to Respondent’s Answer on the basis the Answer does not allege any facts in
support of most of its purported defenses, and only alleges that Petitioner
received a partial payment.
A petition to
confirm an arbitration award can only be challenged by a petition to vacate or
correct an arbitration award.  (C.C.P.
§1285.2.)  C.C.P. §1286.2 sets forth the
grounds on which an arbitration award may be challenged.  
Here, Respondent’s
Answer is an inappropriate procedural mechanism to challenge Petitioner’s
petition.  Further, Respondent’s Answer
does not challenge Petitioner’s petition on the grounds that the arbitration
award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means or
corruption in any of the arbitrators; that the arbitrator exceeded her powers; or
that the arbitrator failed to timely disclose grounds for disqualification.  (C.C.P. §1286.2.)
Accordingly,
Respondent’s Answer fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a defense and
is sustained without leave to amend.
 
Conclusion
Petitioner’s
demurrer to Respondent’s Answer is sustained without leave to amend.
Moving Party to
give notice.
