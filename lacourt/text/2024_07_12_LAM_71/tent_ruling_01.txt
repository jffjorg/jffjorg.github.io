CRAIG NELSON, et al.,

SCOTT NORTHERN, et al.
  


 Case No.: 
  21STCV08461
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  July 12, 2024



 
Plaintiffs Craig Nelson’s and
Stacy Nelson’s motion to bifurcate trial is granted.
 
Plaintiffs
Craig Nelson (“Craig”) and Stacy Nelson (“Stacy”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)
move for this Court to bifurcated Plaintiffs’ claims for damages against
Defendant Mike Brown Grandstands, Inc. (“Mike Brown”) from Defendants’ Cross
Claim for Indemnity.  (Notice of Motion,
pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §§128(3), 598, 1048(b).)
 
Background
Plaintiffs
filed their Complaint for Personal Injuries against Defendants Mike Brown and
their employee Scott Northern (“Northern”) on March 2, 2020.  On October 21, 2021, Defendant Mike Brown
filed a Motion for Leave to File Cross-Complaint for express contractual
identity against Hollywood Christmas Parade Television, LLC (“Hollywood”),
which this Court granted.  Mike Brown’s
Cross-Complaint alleges five causes of action: (1) express contractual
indemnity; (2) total implied indemnity; (3) comparative equitable indemnity;
(4) equitable contribution; and (5) declaratory relief.
On
August 24, 2023, this Court granted Hollywood’s Motion for Summary Judgment of Plaintiffs’
Complaint finding that the Privette presumption applied, and therefore no
defendant may attempt to attribute fault to Hollywood during trial.  (See C.C.P. §437c(l).)
Plaintiffs filed the instant
motion on March 22, 2024.  Mike Brown
filed its opposition on April 22, 2024. 
Hollywood filed its opposition on April 22, 2024.  Plaintiffs filed their reply on April 26,
2024.
 
Motion to Bifurcate Trial
C.C.P. §598 provides, in part,
 
The court may, when the convenience of witnesses, the ends of justice, or
the economy and efficiency of handling the litigation would be promoted
thereby, on motion of a party, after notice and hearing, make an order, no
later than the close of pretrial conference in cases in which such pretrial
conference is to be held, or, in other cases, no later than 30 days before the
trial date, that the trial of any issue or any part thereof shall precede the
trial of any other issue or any part thereof in the case, except for special
defenses which may be tried first pursuant to Sections 597 and 597.5.  
 
(C.C.P. §598.) 
Additionally, Evidence Code §320 provides that
“[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law, the court in its discretion shall
regulate the order of proof.” “Under these provisions, trial courts have broad
discretion to determine the order of proof in the interests of judicial
economy.”  (Grappo v. Coventry
Financial Corp. (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 496, 504.)  Further, “[t]he statutory provisions for
severance and separate trials (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 598, 1048) are not limited
to the separate trial of a ‘cause of action’ but also authorize a separate
trial of any ‘issue.’”  (American
Motorists Insurance Co. v. Superior Court (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 864, 872.) 
Here, the ends of justice necessitate this Court
hearing the issue of Mike Brown’s express indemnity cause of action before the
trial on Plaintiffs’ claims. The Court’s decision on the express indemnity
provision should dispose of the need for Hollywood to appear or partake in the
trial on Plaintiffs’ claims. A bench trial determining the express indemnity
issue would require few witnesses and would likely take up very little time,
which would further judicial economy.
Therefore, Plaintiff’s motion to bifurcate trial is
granted.
 
          Conclusion
          Plaintiffs’
motion to bifurcate trial is granted.
Moving
Party to give notice.
