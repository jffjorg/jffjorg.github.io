And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Tony Robert Tawil v. Galpin Motors, Inc. The judge has overruled the defendant's demurrer to the first cause of action (COA) for fraud and deceit, finding that the allegations in the First Amended Complaint (FAC) are sufficient to plead the element of justifiable reliance. The judge also denied the defendant's motion to strike the request for punitive damages, finding that the FAC sufficiently alleged specific facts to support the fraud COA.

The judge's ruling is based on the facts presented in the FAC, which alleges that the defendant misrepresented the price of a vehicle and that the plaintiff reasonably relied on those misrepresentations. The judge found that the allegations in the FAC are sufficient to plead the element of justifiable reliance, and that the request for punitive damages is sufficient to plead facts to support malice, oppression, or fraud.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further briefing and oral argument, but it suggests that the plaintiff's claims for fraud and deceit may be viable.
