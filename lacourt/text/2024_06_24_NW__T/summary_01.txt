And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 21VECV01391, in which Defendant Gregory Geiser has demurred to Plaintiff Gregory Rovenger's complaint. The judge has sustained the demurrer with 20 days' leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiff must re-file the complaint and address the defects identified by the judge. The judge has also disregarded a declaration submitted by Coyner, as it was not relevant to the demurrer. The judge has determined that the plaintiff's Doe Amendment adding the defendant was proper, and therefore the claims relate back to the filing of the complaint. The judge has found that the defendant's statute of limitations argument is unpersuasive, and that the plaintiff's pleading defects can be cured with additional facts. The judge has granted leave to amend, but only to cure the identified pleading defects and not to add new causes of action.
