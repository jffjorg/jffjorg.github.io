And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's ex parte application for five different relief requests. These requests include allowing depositions to move forward, permitting third-party and witness subpoenas during a stay, advancing the plaintiff's motion for in camera review to July 26, 2024, permitting the plaintiff to re-file its motion for sanctions, and ordering Lasalle to correct the record. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to make an affirmative factual showing in a declaration containing competent testimony based on personal knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte. As a result, the judge determined that no exigent circumstances have been shown, and if the relief sought would affect an opposing party's rights, a noticed motion will be required.
