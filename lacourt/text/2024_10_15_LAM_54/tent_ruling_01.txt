Motion to Dismiss
Moving Party: Defendant/Cross-Complainant Brenda
Dietlein aka Brenda-Lee Malley
Responding Party: Plaintiff Robert Farias
 
T/R:     DEFENDANT’S
MOTION TO DISMISS IS DENIED.
DEFENDANT TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
 
The Court considers the moving papers,
opposition, and reply. 
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Brenda Dietlein
aka Brenda-Lee Malley moves to dismiss this action on the grounds that
Plaintiff failed to properly serve Defendant, that the action should be removed
to federal court under diversity jurisdiction, and that the operative pleading
fails to state a claim. 
On November 2, 2022, Defendant filed an
answer to Plaintiff’s first amended complaint and filed a cross-complaint
against Plaintiff. These actions preclude Defendant from challenging service;
Plaintiff has submitted to the Court’s jurisdiction. Defendant may not
challenge the sufficiency of the pleadings via demurrer as Defendant has
already answered the FAC. This Court may not decide whether a federal court
would have jurisdiction.
The motion to dismiss is DENIED.
