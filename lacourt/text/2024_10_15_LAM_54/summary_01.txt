And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling states that the defendant's motion to dismiss the lawsuit is denied. The defendant, Brenda Dietlein, aka Brenda-Lee Malley, argued that the plaintiff failed to properly serve her, that the action should be removed to federal court under diversity jurisdiction, and that the operative pleading fails to state a claim. However, the court has already considered the defendant's answer and cross-complaint, which precludes her from challenging service and the sufficiency of the pleadings. Additionally, the court may not decide whether a federal court would have jurisdiction. The court's decision denies the motion to dismiss.
