Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
Motion to File First Amended
Cross-Complaint
Moving Party: Defendant/Cross-Complainant The Kristine Taylor Philanthropies
Responding Party: None
 
T/R:      DEFENDANT/CROSS-COMPLAINANT’S MOTIONS
FOR LEAVE TO FILE A FIRST AMENDED CROSS-COMPLAINT IS GRANTED.
 
DEFENDANT TO NOTICE. 
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received.
 
The Court may allow, in furtherance of
justice, and “upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or
proceeding in other particulars….”  (CCP
§ 473(a)(1).)  A motion to amend a
pleading before trial must be accompanied by a separate declaration that
specifies (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary
and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were
discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for amendment was not made
earlier.  (CRC Rule 3.1324(b).)
It is not an abuse of discretion of the court
to grant the motion unless there is a “showing that actual unfairness or
obvious prejudice has resulted from the allowance of such an amendment”.  (Posz v. Burchell (1962) 209
Cal.App.2d 324, 334.)  “Counsel on the
firing line in an actual trial must be prepared for surprises, including
requests for amendments of pleading.”  (Ibid.)  Absent a showing of prejudice, delay alone is
insufficient grounds for denial.  (See
Higgins v. Del Faro (1981) 123 Cal. App. 3d 558, 564–65.)
Cross-Complainant The Kristine Taylor Philanthropies moves for leave to file a first
amended cross-complaint. Cross-Complainant asserts that additional facts have
been learned in discovery and pleaded in Plaintiff’s amended complaint. The Court finds that the amendment is
in the interest of justice.
 
Cross-Complainant’s motion for leave to
amend is GRANTED.
