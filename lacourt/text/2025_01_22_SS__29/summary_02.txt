And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively denied four discovery motions filed by the defendant, which were set to be heard on January 22, 2025. The motions seek to compel the plaintiff, Bryan Miranda, to respond to form interrogatories, supplemental interrogatories, supplemental requests for production, and requests for admission. The defendant also seeks sanctions in each motion. The judge finds that the motions are untimely because they were filed after the expiration of the 15-day deadline for discovery motions before trial, which is set for January 27, 2025. The judge notes that the plaintiff has not filed any opposition to the motions, and that the defendant has not demonstrated that the plaintiff's failure to respond to the discovery requests has caused any harm or delay. The judge concludes that the motions are denied as untimely.
