Here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motions to compel the depositions of Sonia Hernandez and Adrian Rios without prejudice. The motions were filed on December 10, 2024, and sought to compel the defendant to produce its employees for deposition and to produce documents. The defendant filed late oppositions on January 14, 2025, which the judge declines to consider due to a lack of adequate justification or explanation for the late filings. The judge finds that the plaintiff appears to be entitled to take these depositions under the Civil Discovery Act, but to obtain a court order compelling the depositions, the requirements of the statute must be followed. The evidence shows that the plaintiff agreed to continue the depositions, and the court cannot grant a motion to compel a deposition that the moving party agreed to continue and then did not renotice. Therefore, the motions are denied without prejudice.
