Background
On May 17, 2022, Ilsa Miranda, Bryan Miranda,
and Erick Ojeda (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against Vardui
Melkonian (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 10 for motor vehicle negligence
arising out of an automobile accident occurring on December 19, 2019.
Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint on
July 17, 2023.
On October 4, 2023, Defendant filed an
answer.
In December 2023 and February 2024,
Plaintiffs amended their complaint to name Wanda Ivascyn as Doe 1 and John
Ivascyn as Doe 2.
On March 22, 2024, Wanda and John Ivascyn
filed an answer and cross-complaint against Defendant. The cross-complaint was
dismissed on May 1, 2024.
On October 22 and November 22, 2024, the
Court granted the motion of Plaintiffs’ former counsel to be relieved.
Before the Court and set for hearing on January
22, 2025, are four discovery motions filed by Defendant on December 16, 2024:
(1) Motion to Compel Plaintiff Bryan Miranda to Respond to Form Interrogatories
(Set Two); (2) Motion to Compel Plaintiff Bryan Miranda to Respond to
Supplemental Interrogatories (Set One); (3) Motion to Compel Plaintiff Bryan
Miranda to Respond to Supplemental Requests for Production (Set One); and
(4) Motion for Order Deeming Plaintiff Bryan Miranda to Have Admitted the Truth
of the Matters Specified in Requests for Admission
(Set One).  Defendant also seeks sanctions in each motion.
No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
 
A party must
respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are directed does not provide a
timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling
response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is
no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer
efforts are required. (See Id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must
respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after service.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for
production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).) 
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct.
(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for
admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
Code of Civil Procedure section
2024.020 provides that all discovery motions must be heard no later than 15
days before trial.
 
Trial is set for January 27, 2025.
 
Accordingly, the motions are denied
as untimely.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES each of these four
discovery motions as untimely.
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
