And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion by the defendants to conduct additional physical examinations of the plaintiff, including neurological and otolaryngological exams. The judge notes that the moving party's declaration summarily states the facts without showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of the issues presented by the motion, as required by California law. Additionally, the plaintiff's opposition was filed late, and the defendants' reply was also late. The judge decides to continue the hearing to February 3, 2025, when another discovery motion in the case will also be heard, and to consider the late-filed opposition. The judge also grants the defendants' leave to file a supplemental reply no less than five court days before the hearing.
