And here is a summary in English text of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Defendant, Unruly Agency, LLC, sought ex parte relief to file a late opposition and continue the hearing to allow time for a reply. However, the Court denied this request. The Court notes that even if it considered the Opposition filed as an attachment to the ex parte request, the Opposition does nothing more than mischaracterize the Court of Appeal decision. The Court of Appeal opinion is clear on its disposition, reversing the trial court's order regarding the Defendant's fifth crossclaim. The Defendant's arguments that the Court of Appeal decision was wrong have no bearing on the issue of fees.
