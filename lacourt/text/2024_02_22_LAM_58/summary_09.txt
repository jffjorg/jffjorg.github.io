Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The motion for summary adjudication brought by Cross-Complainant Howard S. Fredman is denied. The motion sought to adjudicate the first cause of action for breach of contract in the Cross-Complaint, alleging that Kettler failed to pay FLP for services rendered. The judge found that there is a triable issue of material fact in dispute regarding the mediation requirement, which defeats the motion for summary adjudication.

The judge also found that Cross-Defendant Kettler's evidence fails to raise a triable issue of material facts demonstrating legal malpractice. The evidence presented by Kettler is speculative and relies on conjecture, rather than admissible evidence, to support his claims.

The motion for a continuance of the hearing is denied as moot.

In summary, the judge's tentative ruling denies the motion for summary adjudication brought by Cross-Complainant Fredman, finding that there is a triable issue of material fact in dispute regarding the mediation requirement, and also finds that Cross-Defendant Kettler's evidence fails to raise a triable issue of material facts demonstrating legal malpractice.
