[1]           Defendant sought ex parte relief to file
a late opposition and continue the hearing to allow time for a reply. The Court
denied this ex parte request. 


[2]           Even if the Court considered the
Opposition filed as an attachment to the ex parte, the Opposition does nothing
more than mischaracterize the Court of Appeal decision. The disposition in the Court
of Appeal opinion is clear: “We reverse the trial court’s April 19, 2022 order
insofar as the trial court denied appellant Sarah Stage’s special motion to
strike respondent Unruly Agency, LLC’s (Unruly’s) fifth crossclaim. We affirm
the trial court’s order to the extent the court denied Stage’s motion to strike
Unruly’s first and second crossclaims. The matter is remanded to the trial
court with instructions to (1) enter a new order granting Stage’s motion to
strike Unruly’s fifth cross-claim, and (2) conduct further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.”  Furthermore, Defendant
Unruly’s arguments that the Court of Appeal’s decision was wrong have no
bearing on the issue of fees.
