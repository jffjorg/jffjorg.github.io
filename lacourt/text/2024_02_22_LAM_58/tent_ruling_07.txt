 
             On May 25, 2022, Plaintiff Leticia Blanco (Plaintiff)
filed the instant action against Defendants DLF Logistics LLC (DLF), Joeana
Lugo, And Devan Carez (collectively, Defendants), asserting claims for sexual
harassment, discrimination based on sex, disability discrimination,
retaliation, wrongful termination, and related claims.
 
            On January
13, 2023, Defendant DLF filed a motion to compel this matter to arbitration and
stay all proceedings. On April 17, 2023, the Court granted Defendant DLF’s
Motion to Compel Arbitration and ordered this matter to arbitration (except
Plaintiff’s sexual harassment claim); the Court stayed the matter pending
arbitration.
 
            Plaintiff
now moves the Court, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1281.98, for an Order vacating its April 17, 2023 Order
compelling the instant case to arbitration as a result of Defendants’ failure
to pay the arbitrator's fees within 30-days of the December 4, 2023 due date.
Plaintiff also requests sanctions pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
1281.98.
 
            On January
22, 2024, the Court advanced this motion to address the issue of vacating the
order to compel arbitration and granted this relief. Only the issue of
sanctions remains.
 
            No
opposition was filed. 
 
Subdivision
(b) of section 1281.98 allows the employee or consumer to “unilaterally elect”
any of several options if “the drafting party materially breaches the
arbitration agreement and is in default” under subdivision (a). The employee or
consumer may “[w]ithdraw the claim from arbitration and proceed in a court of
appropriate jurisdiction” (§ 1281.98, subd. (b)(1)), “[c]ontinue the
arbitration proceeding, if the arbitration provider agrees to continue
administering the proceeding, notwithstanding the drafting party's failure to
pay fees or costs” (§ 1281.98, subd. (b)(2)), “[p]etition the court for an
order compelling the drafting party to pay all arbitration fees that the
drafting party is obligated to pay under the arbitration agreement or the rules
of the arbitration provider” (§ 1281.98, subd. (b)(3)), or “[p]ay the drafting
party's fees and proceed with the arbitration proceeding” (§ 1281.98, subd.
(b)(4)).
 
Subdivision
(c) of section 1281.98 provides that if the employee or consumer withdraws the
claim from arbitration and proceeds in court, he or she “may bring a motion, or
a separate action, to recover all attorney's fees and all costs associated with
the abandoned arbitration proceeding” (§ 1281.98, subd. (c)(1)), and the “court
shall impose sanctions on the drafting party” in accordance with section
1281.99 (§ 1281.98, subd. (c)(2)).
 
Here, Plaintiff requests that
sanctions be awarded against Defendant DLF in the amount of $5,910 for
attorney’s fees and costs that Plaintiff has incurred as a result of Defendant
DLF’s material breach of the arbitration agreement. The amount requested is
based on both a reasonable hourly rate and reasonable number of hours incurred,
plus necessary costs.. (Ayala Decl., ¶¶ 19-20.)
 
            The motion
requesting sanctions is granted in the amount of $5,910.  DLF is ordered to pay that sum to Plaintiff’s
counsel on or before March 22, 2024.
