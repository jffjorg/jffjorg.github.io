for Attorney Fees 
Moving Party:             Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant

Tentative Ruling:      The
Motion for Attorney Fees and Costs are granted in a reduced amount. 

             
            On February 23, 2022, Plaintiff
Sarah Stage filed her complaint against Defendants Unruly and its founders,
Tara Niknejad and Nicky Gathrite, alleging that Defendants induced Plaintiff to
enter into an agreement based on representations made by Defendants in their
Services Agreement, including that Defendants would act to protect Plaintiff’s
interests. She alleged that Defendants sent explicit messages and disseminated
photos to online users of OnlyFans without Plaintiff’s consent. The Complaint
contains causes of action for breach of contract, breach of the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, intentional misrepresentation,
negligent misrepresentation, misappropriation of name and likeness, intentional
infliction of emotional distress, negligent interference with prospective
economic advantage, unfair competition, and declaratory relief.
 
On
February 25, 2022, Unruly filed a Cross-Complaint against Stage for breach of
contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,
intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and intentional
interference with economic relations.
 
On
March 23, 2022, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Stage filed
a special motion to strike (anti-SLAPP) as to Unruly’s to Cross-Complaint. On
April 19, 2022, the Court denied Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Stage’s anti-SLAPP
motion. 
 
Following
an appeal of this decision, on October 23, 2023, the Court of Appeal reversed
the trial court’s order on the anti-SLAPP as to Unruly’s fifth cause of action
for intentional interference with contractual relations.
 
Plaintiff
now seeks attorney fees in the amount of $99,875. No opposition was filed.[1]
 
The
motion for attorney fees is granted in the reduced amount of $59,900. 
 
Legal Standard 
 
         Code
of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c) provides, in pertinent part:
“in any action subject to subdivision (b), a prevailing defendant on a special
motion to strike shall be entitled to recover that defendant's attorney's fees
and costs.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (c)(1).) “Thus, under ... section
425.16, subdivision (c), any SLAPP defendant who brings a successful motion to
strike is entitled to mandatory attorney fees.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001)
24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131.)
 
         Further,
“any award of attorney’s fees under section 425.16, subdivision (c), shall also
include the fees incurred in prosecuting [an] appeal.” (Liu v. Moore
(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 745, 755.)
 
Motion for Attorney Fees
 
Stage
seeks attorney fees in the amount of $99,875, which includes a multiplier of
1.25. 
 
Entitlement to Attorney Fees:
 
            In
moving for attorney fees and costs, Cross-Defendant Stage argues that she is
entitled to fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16,
subdivision (c). 
 
In the absence of an opposition, there is no
dispute that Cross-Defendant Stage is entitled to fees as the prevailing party
on her anti-SLAPP motion.[2]

 
Amount of Attorney Fees:
 
Cross-Defendant
Stage first argues that her counsels’ hourly rates are reasonable. 
 
In assessing the reasonableness of
hourly billing rates,¿“the court may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity
with the legal market, as well as the experience, skill, and reputation of the
attorney requesting fees [citation], the difficulty or complexity of the
litigation to which that skill was applied [citations], and affidavits from
other attorneys regarding prevailing fees in the community and rate
determinations in other cases.”¿(569 East County Boulevard LLC v.
Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc.¿(2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 437; see¿Mountjoy
v. Bank of America, N.A.¿(2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266, 272 [“ ‘ “a reasonable
hourly rate is the product of a multiplicity of factors…[including] the level
of skill necessary, time limitations, the amount to be obtained in the
litigation, the attorney’s reputation, and the undesirability of the case” ’
”].)¿
            Here, Attorney
Dowlatshahi billed at an hourly rate of $575 in 2022 and 2023. (Dowlatshahi
Decl., ¶ 10.) In 2022 and 2023, Attorney Sadat billed at an hourly rate of
$625. (Sadat Decl., ¶ 6.) In 2022 and 2023, Paralegal Anleu billed at an hourly
rate of $250. (Dowlatshahi Decl., ¶ 11.) In 2024, Attorney Sadat’s rate
increased to $650 per hour and Attorney Dowlatshahi’s rate increased to $600
per hour. (Dowlatshahi Decl., ¶ 10; Sadat Decl., ¶ 6.)
A review of the declarations in support of the motion for
attorney’s fees – which contains the descriptions of each attorneys’ education
and experience – supports finding Stage’s attorneys’ hourly rates ranging from
$250 to $650 were reasonable; the rates are supported by substantial evidence
under the present circumstances. (Dowlatshahi Decl.,
¶¶ 9-11; Sadat Decl., ¶¶ 4-6.) Based on the Court's familiarity with the
current local market, and Stage’s evidence of the experience and skills of the
various attorneys – Stage’s requested rates per hour are reasonable.
 
The Court will next consider the number of hours
incurred. 
 
In
support of the motion for fees, Stage’s attorneys represent that the firm worked
approximately 141.50 hours litigating the anti-SLAPP, which includes time
incurred on the appeal and for the related fee motion. (Dowlatshahi Decl., ¶¶
2, 11-12; Sadat Decl., ¶¶ 2, 7.) Specifically, Cross-Defendant Stage’s counsel
represents that Attorney Dowlatshahi incurred 78 hours, Attorney Sadat incurred
38 hours, and Paralegal Anleu incurred 12.0 hours. 
 
The
hours incurred are excessive and unreasonable. 
 
In
drafting and defending the special motion to strike, counsel incurred 58.5
hours. In preparing and prosecuting the appeal, counsel incurred 69.5 hours. Finally,
counsel contends that they incurred 13.5 hours the attorney fee motion,
including estimated time for the reply and hearing. 
 
In the absence of billing records, the
Court has only the number of hours incurred generally for these tasks related to
this motion to consider. (Mot., 5:12-6:11.) The hours incurred on these tasks
are excessive on their face.  The Court
notes that on appeal, Stage prevailed on only one cause of action, and the
statutory basis on which the appellate court reversed – Code of Civil Procedure
section 425.16, subdivision (e)(2) – had not been raised here. It is
appropriate therefore to reduce the fee request for time spent on matters that were
unsuccessful. (ComputerXpress, Inc. v. Jackson (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 993, 1020 [“Defendants consequently are entitled
to recover attorney fees and costs incurred in moving to strike the claims on
which they prevailed, but not fees and costs incurred in moving to strike the
remaining claims”].)


Applying
a blended rate of $500, the court will reduce the number of hours incurred on
the anti-SLAPP motion by 15 hours for a reduction of $7,500. The Court will
reduce the number of hours incurred on the appeal by 20 hours for a reduction
of $10,000. Finally, the hours on the attorney fee motion must be reduced as
excessive but must also be reduced in light of the fact that there was no
opposition or reply; the Court will reduce these hours by 5 hours for a
reduction of $2,500. 
 
Thus,
the Court will reduce the
lodestar fees requested by Stage ($79,900) in the total amount of $20,000, for
a total of $59,900.
 
Multiplier adjustment
 
            Finally, Stage seeks a
1.5 lodestar multiplier based on the risk of taking on the case on contingency,
the complexity of the issues involved, and for forgoing employment from other business.  
 
            Relevant factors to
determine whether an enhancement is appropriate include (1) the novelty and
difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1132.)  
 
            Although this matter
was apparently taken on contingency, none of the other factors support the
application of a multiplier. The anti-SLAPP issue was not novel.  Stage achieved only partial success and
displayed no extraordinary skill. Stage did not raise section 425.16, subdivision
(e)(2) in the trial court and on appeal abandoned its motion regarding the
first and second cross-claims. Its filings in this court ignored relevant
Supreme Court authority. The evidence only shows that counsel was forced to reduce
the amount of time dedicated to other matters because of this litigation but
does not specifically indicate that any employment was turned down. (Dowlatshahi
Decl., ¶ 10; Sadat Decl., ¶ 6.) Further,
the¿contingent risks, skill, and difficulty¿Stage’s attorneys¿assert are
absorbed by¿their¿already high (albeit reasonable) hourly rates. (See¿Robertson
v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California. Inc.¿(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th
785, 822.) 
 
            Accordingly, Stage’s
request for a lodestar multiplier is denied.
 
Conclusion
 
            Plaintiff Stage’s motion for
attorney fees and costs is granted in the amount of $59,900.  Defendant Unruly shall pay to Plaintiff’s
counsel this amount on or before March 22, 2024.
