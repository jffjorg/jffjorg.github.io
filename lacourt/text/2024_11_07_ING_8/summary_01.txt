Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel General Motors (GM) to comply with a discovery order issued on June 25, 2024. The order required GM to produce technical documents related to symptoms described in the plaintiff's defect definition. The plaintiff argues that GM has failed to produce all required documents and seeks an order compelling GM to produce the documents and imposing sanctions on GM.

The judge notes that the parties have met and conferred regarding this discovery, but the judge is unable to determine from the moving papers or opposition papers what exactly remains at issue in this motion. The judge is concerned that GM has not provided sufficient detail about the documents it has produced and requests that counsel be prepared to discuss what has and has not been produced at oral argument.

The judge is inclined to continue the motion pending the outcome of oral argument and may need to order the person who verified the responses to attend a future hearing to walk the judge through what was produced and what else remains and has not been produced as to each category of the RFPs in dispute.
