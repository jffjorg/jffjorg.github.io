Nazar v. Shawn Yadidi, et al.
Case
No. 21STCV46583
Ex
Parte Application
 
            Plaintiffs
Mandana Nazar and Fole, Inc. dba as “Suncare Medical Supplies” (“Suncare”)
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action against Defendants Shawn Yadidi,
Promed Medical Supplies (“Promed”), and Navid Zad (collectively, “Defendants”)
asserting 22 causes of action for employment-based claims, discrimination and
sexual harassment, defamation and trade libel, intentional infliction of
emotional distress, interference with existing and prospective contractual
relationships, and unfair competition.  Shawn
Yadidi and Promed filed a first amended cross-complaint against Plaintiffs
asserting causes of action for civil conspiracy for fraud, misappropriation of
trade secrets, and unfair business practices. 
The complaint was filed on December 21, 2021, and the first amended
cross-complaint was filed on September 28, 2022.
 
            This
case has been rife with gamesmanship and a lack of civility and professionalism
which has necessitated unnecessary litigation. 
Counsel for Defendants has twice refused to extend common courtesies in
extending filing deadlines, necessitating ex parte applications, both of which
were granted.  (See Court’s Minute
Orders, dated January 4, 2023 and February 23, 2023.)  In one order, the Court noted that “[t]he
Court should not have to resolve disputes of this nature” and ordered the
parties to review the Los Angeles County Superior Court’s Guidelines for
Civility in Litigation.  (See Court’s
Minute Order, dated February 23, 2023.)  In
another order, the Court found that one attorney for Defendants sent
“correspondence that was argumentative and disrespectful, which is
counterproductive to resolving discovery disputes.”  (See Court’s Minute Order, dated July 5,
2023.)  Moreover, there have been
unsubstantiated allegations.  One
attorney for Defendants told a witness’s attorney that Plaintiff “has been
trying to hire people to purchase guns and harm our client” and suggested that
Plaintiff’s counsel should “place her client on notice to cease and desist her
actions to hire hitmen and attempt to harm civilians.”  (See Court’s Minute Order, dated September 6,
2023, at p. 2.)  Plaintiff’s counsel
accused the friend of a witness of threatening harm to Plaintiff.  (Ibid.) 
Based upon the foregoing, the Court ordered a stay as a “cooling off”
period.  “The Court is concerned by the
parties’ conduct, and this case has taken on a level of acrimony that is
counterproductive to the litigation and resolution.”  (Id., p. 1.) 
The Court ordered all depositions to be conducted remotely for the
safety of the parties unless the parties stipulate otherwise.  (Id., p. 3.) 
 
 
            The
Court also has concerns that Plaintiff was engaged in gamesmanship in not
sitting for her deposition before the Court’s order of September 6, 2023.  Defendants served a notice of deposition on
October 27, 2022, and noticed the deposition for November 22, 2022.  At the hearing on February 14, 2023,
Plaintiff’s counsel “conceded that her client must appear for a deposition and
suggested that the Court order the deposition and set a 45-day deadline.”  (See Court’s Minute Order, dated February 14,
2023.)  The Court did so.  Yet, Plaintiff’s deposition still has not
occurred.  Plaintiff has cited ongoing
health issues and frequent international travel, but the record does not
support a delay of this length.  The
Court also notes that Defendants’ unclean hands in the conduct of this
litigation may have contributed to this delay as well.      
 
            On
September 6, 2023, the Court ordered that Plaintiff’s deposition would occur
between December 6, 2023, and January 5, 2024. 
The Court ordered: “If Plaintiff will be unable to comply with this
order, the Court orders Plaintiff’s counsel to file declarations and supporting
medical documentation on or before November 6, 2023, explaining why she cannot
sit for her deposition.”  (See Court’s
Minute Order, dated September 6, 2023, p. 3.) 
No such documentation was filed. 
The Court ordered that the depositions of Defendants Shawn Yadidi, Navid
Zad, and Promed Medical Supplies shall occur after Plaintiff’s deposition.  (Id., pp. 2-3.)  The Court set a deposition scheduling
conference on December 6, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. 
The hearing was continued due to a death in the judge’s family.  (See Court’s Minute Order, dated November 29,
2023.)
 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel attempted to schedule the deposition. 
(See Declaration of Heather L. McCloskey, Exh. A.)        On
December 5, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendants’ counsel to inquire
whether he was available to conduct Plaintiff’s deposition on December 18, 19,
or 20, 2023.  Receiving no reply,
Plaintiff’s counsel emailed again on December 8, 2023, to inquire whether those
dates would work.  Defendants’ counsel
asked for dates in “mid to late January,” even though those dates were after
the deadline set by the Court (January 5, 2024).  On December 10, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel
responded that her client was available between December 11 and 21, 2023.  Again, Defendants’ counsel did not respond.  On December 15, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel
again emailed to inquire when he would like to take Plaintiff’s
deposition.  Again, Defendants’ counsel
asked for dates in “mid to late January,” even though those dates were after
the deadline set by the Court (January 5, 2024).  On December 20, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel
emailed and offered January 4 or January 5, 2024.  Defendants’ counsel did not respond.  Then, on January 1, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel
emailed to inform him of a conflict on the morning of January 5, 2024, but
offered to begin at 1:00 p.m. and then seek an extension of the deadline to
finish the deposition.  Again,
Defendants’ counsel asked for dates in “mid to late January” even though those
dates were after the deadline set by the Court (January 5, 2024).  
 
            Based
upon the correspondence, it is clear that Defendants’ counsel is responsible
for the failure to take Plaintiff’s deposition. 
The Court ordered the deposition to occur between December 6, 2023, and
January 5, 2024.  Plaintiff’s counsel
offered him numerous dates between December 11, 2023, and January 5, 2024.  Plaintiff’s counsel was proactive in emailing
Defendants’ counsel, and he twice failed to respond: (1) Defendants’ counsel
failed to respond to the email of December 8, 2023, necessitating a follow-up
email on December 10, 2023; and (2) Defendants’ counsel failed to respond to
the email of December 20, 2023, until January 1, 2024.  
 
            The
Court is baffled by Defendants’ counsel’s approach to this issue.  Defendants’ counsel—who purportedly wants to
take Plaintiff’s deposition—made no apparent effort to schedule the
deposition.  Instead, Plaintiff’s counsel
took the initiative.  The Court set a
deadline for Plaintiff’s deposition, which was January 5, 2024.  Yet, Defendants’ counsel repeatedly asked for
dates after the Court-ordered deadline and never sought to extend this deadline.  Even in his opposition, he does not
acknowledge or address this deadline.  The
Court gave some consideration to finding that Defendants have waived the right
to take Plaintiff’s deposition, but declines to do so.  Plaintiff is not seeking that remedy and
still is willing to sit for her deposition. 
Also, the Court’s unexpected absence on December 6, 2023, prevented the
Court from setting the deposition date, which would have circumvented this
dispute.  Therefore, the Court will give
Defendants’ counsel the benefit of these issues.  
 
Based upon the
foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
1.         Plaintiff’s ex parte application is
granted.  
 
2.         The Court orders the deposition of
Plaintiff to occur remotely on Friday, March 29, 2024, starting at 9:00 a.m.  The parties may not change the
date/time/location of this deposition unless they file a stipulation and
proposed order.  The Court provides
notice: If Plaintiff’s deposition does not go forward based upon the conduct of
Defendants or their counsel, the Court will find that they have waived the
right to take Plaintiff’s deposition.    
 
3.         The Court advances and continues the
hearing on Defendants’ motion for terminating sanctions from February 14, 2024,
to May 2, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  
 
4.         The Court orders the parties to file a
joint statement on or before April 2, 2024, informing the Court: (a) Whether
the deposition was completed and the motion for terminating sanctions is
off-calendar; or (b) Whether the deposition was not completed and the Court
must decide the motion for terminating sanctions.
 
5.         If the Court must decide the motion for
terminating sanctions, Defendants may file a supplement to the motion to
reference any additional grounds for terminating sanctions that occurred after
the motion was first filed (e.g., any failure to comply with this order,
etc.)  Plaintiff may file a supplemental
opposition, and Defendants may file a supplemental reply brief.  All supplemental briefing shall be due based
upon statutory deadlines for the hearing date of May 2, 2024.  
 
6.         The Court orders the depositions of
Shawn Yadidi, Navid Zad, and Promed Medical Supplies to be conducted on April 8,
9, and 10, 2024.  The depositions shall
be conducted in the following order:
 
            a.         Shawn
Yadidi on April __, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. 
 
            b.         Navid
Zad on April __, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. 
 
            c.         Promed
Medical Supplies on April __, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.
 
These depositions shall be
conducted remotely.  The parties may not
change the date/time/location of the depositions unless they file a stipulation
and proposed order.  The Court provides
notice: If these depositions do not go forward based upon the conduct of
Plaintiff or her counsel, the Court will find that they have waived the right
to take Defendants’ depositions.
 
            7.         Given the conduct of the parties, the
Court issues an Order to Show Cause why it should not appoint a discovery
referee to preside over the depositions under Code of Civil Procedure section
639.  The OSC hearing shall be held on
February 14, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  The
parties may file a response to this OSC at least nine (9) court days in advance
of the hearing. 
 
            8.         Plaintiff’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
