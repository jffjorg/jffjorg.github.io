And here is a summary in English text of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has granted Defendant's motion to set aside the default judgment and default judgment entered against it. The Court found that the default judgment was void because the Secretary of State did not serve the documents on Defendant until October 24, 2022, after the default judgment had already been issued. The Court also ruled that Defendant was properly served through the Secretary of State. The Court orders Defendant to file an answer or responsive pleading on or before February 22, 2024, and sets a case management conference for March 13, 2024. The Court denies Plaintiff's motion for a turnover order.
