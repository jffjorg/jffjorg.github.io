Solutions, LLC v. BDB Properties, Inc.
Case No.
19STCV28189
Motion to Set
Aside Default
Motion for a Turnover
Order
 
Plaintiff SoCal
Lien Solutions, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed this breach of contract action against
BDB Properties (“Defendant”), based upon having been assigned the claim, per
Civil Code section 954.  The Court
incorporates its minute orders of March 23, 2021, and September 29, 2023, by
reference and includes the relevant details in this order.  
 
Plaintiff filed
this action on August 8, 2019.  The
summons and original complaint were served on  “Vanik Vergovian of Shalili &
Shalili—Agent for Service” at “1200 S. Hope Street, Ste. 1000, Los Angeles, CA
90015.”  Plaintiff obtained a default
judgment, following which Defendant filed an ex parte application to set aside
that default judgment.  The Court gave
Defendant the benefit of the doubt and granted the ex parte application on
March 23, 2021.   
 
Following that
hearing, on March 29, 2021, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint.  Plaintiff filed a proof of service on August
23, 2021, which states that “BDB Properties, Inc.” was served personally on
April 21, 2021, at 3:14 p.m. by serving “Daniel Khalili-agent of Service” at
the following address: “925 N Croft Ave Los Angeles CA 90069.”  Plaintiff filed a request for entry of
default, which the Clerk’s Office rejected because: (1) The proof of service stated
that the first amended complaint was served, but not the summons; (2) The
request for entry of default stated that the plaintiff’s name was “SoCal Lien
Solutions, LLC” but the first amended complaint listed the plaintiff as “SoCal
Lien Solutions;” and (3) The request for entry of default stated that the
defendant’s name was “BDB Properties,” but the first amended complaint listed
the defendant’s name as “BDB Properties, Inc.” 
  
 
Plaintiff
corrected these issues and made two attempts to serve Defendant at its
address-of-record.  Plaintiff filed an
application to serve through the Secretary of State which has a declaration
stating that the process server attempted service on December 1, 2021, but could
not locate Defendant at its address-of-record. 
Plaintiff filed a second application to serve through the Secretary of
State which has a declaration stating that the process server attempted service
at Defendant’s address-of-record on March 11, 2022.  The declaration states: “I walked every floor
and found no body or entity with that name.” 
The declaration also states that he made efforts to locate Defendant at
the property through the property manager, to no avail.  The Court granted the application, following
which Plaintiff served the summons and operative complaint through the
Secretary of State.
 
Since that time,
Plaintiff’s counsel mailed requests for entry of default to Defendant’s address
of record: “1200 S Hope St Los Angeles CA 90015.”  These requests for entry of default were
mailed on August 2, 2022; August 4, 2022; August 18, 2022; and August 23, 2022.  The Court entered a default judgment in the
amount of $44,153.36 on September 2, 2022. 

 
Now, Defendant
(again) seeks to set aside default judgment, per Code of Civil Procedure section
473.  As an initial matter, Defendant’s
counsel argues that Plaintiff should have served Defendant through
counsel.  In fact, at the hearing on
March 23, 2021, the Court asked Defendant’s counsel whether he would accept
service, and he indicated that he had no authority to do so.  Defendant’s counsel also argues that Plaintiff
was not eligible to serve Defendant through the Secretary of State.  Per California Corporations Code section
1702, a plaintiff may serve a corporate defendant through the Secretary of
State if, among other things, the agent for service cannot be found.  Plaintiff appears to have satisfied this
requirement, as two different process servers went to Defendant’s purported
address and could not locate Defendant’s office at that address.    
 
            In
support of Defendant’s ex parte application, Daniel Khalili submitted a
declaration stating that he is the sole owner of BDB Properties.  Mr. Khalili states that he is the agent for
service of process and that his address is: “1200 S. Hope Street, Los Angeles,
CA 90012.”  He claims never to have been
served with the summons or complaint, either personally or through his
address.  He also states: “I carefully
receive and review all mail addressed to BDB Properties at 1200 S. Hope Street
in Los Angeles, CA 90012, however I never received the Summons, the Complaint
or any other papers filed in this action.”
 
            The
Court is skeptical of Mr. Khalili’s representations.  Plaintiff’s counsel declared under penalty of
perjury that he mailed four different requests for entry of default to
Defendant’s address-of-record.  The
summons and original complaint were purportedly served at Defendant’s
address-of-record by Mr. Pradip Kissoondyal, a registered process server.  Two different process servers—Mr. Babak
Ghorbanian and Mr. Brian Weller, a registered process server—attempted to serve
the summons and the first amended complaint to Defendant at its
address-of-record and could not locate Defendant at its purported business
address.  A fourth process server—Mr.
Eric Gamble, a registered process server—personally served “Daniel
Khalili.”  It strains credulity for Mr.
Khalili to maintain that his business address is correct and that he was never
served with any pleading concerning this case.
 
            Nevertheless,
the Court must grant the motion.  The
Court entered the default judgment on September 2, 2022, based upon Plaintiff’s
purported service of Defendant through the Secretary of State.  The proof of service was filed on August 17,
2022, and states that the documents were served on the Secretary of State on
June 20, 2022.  Inexplicably, the
Secretary of State did not actually serve the documents on Defendant until
October 24, 2022, after the default judgment had already been issued.  (See Notice of Lodging, filed on December 28,
2023.)  Therefore, the default judgment
is void.    
 
            Based
upon the foregoing, the Court orders as follows:
 
            1.         The Court grants Defendant’s motion to
set aside default and default judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section
473(d).
 
            2.         The Court finds that Defendant was
served through the Secretary of State on October 24, 2022.  The Court’s clerk shall update the docket
accordingly.    
 
            3.         The Court orders Defendant to file an
answer or responsive pleading on or before February 22, 2024.
 
            4.         The Court shall hold a case management
conference on March 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
 
            5.         The Court denies Plaintiff’s motion for
a turnover order.
 
            6.         Plaintiff’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of such with the Court.
