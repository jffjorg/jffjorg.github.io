DEFENDANT NOGA ASSIL IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES WITHOUT OBJECTION TO THE REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.Plaintiff Nekuryan Property Investment, LLC’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and for Sanctions is DENIED.ANALYSIS:Plaintiff Nekuryan Property Investment, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action for recovery of COVID-19 rental debt against Defendant Noga Assil (erroneously sued as Assil Noga) (“Defendant”) on May 30, 2024. Defendant filed an answer on August 19, 2024.On November 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant (1) Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production and for Sanctions; and (2) Motion to Deem Requests For Admission Admitted and for Sanctions. No oppositions have been filed to date.DiscussionMotion to Compel Responses to Request for Production and for SanctionsDefendant’s Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production and for Sanctions is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 2031.260 and 2031.300. The Requests for Production, Set One, consisting of 35 requests, was served on Plaintiff on September 30, 2024. (Motion, Spinrad Decl., ¶3 and Exh. A.) Responses were due by October 30, 2024. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a).) As of the filing of this Motion, however, Plaintiff has received no responses nor objections. (Motion, Spinrad Decl., ¶4.) Based on Defendant’s failure to serve initial responses, Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling Defendant to serve verified responses to the requests for production without objections. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b) [“The party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the demand.”].)Plaintiff also moves for an award of sanctions, which it contends are mandatory, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300, subdivision (c). This statute, however, provides “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c) [emphasis added].) Defendant has neither made nor opposed the instant Motion. Therefore, sanctions cannot be awarded against Defendant pursuant to this statute.The Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production and for Sanctions is granted as to the responses and denied as to the sanctions.Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and for SanctionsDefendant’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and for Sanctions is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 2033.250 and 2033.280. However, the Motion does not demonstrate service of Requests for Admission on Plaintiff. The exhibit attached the supporting declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel that purports to be the Requests for Admission served on Defendant is actually the Requests for Production. (Motion, Spinard Decl., Exh. A.) Plaintiff has not demonstrated service of the Requests for Admission on Defendant.Additionally, the Court notes that Plaintiff has propounded the maximum number of written discovery requests permitted in the limited jurisdiction court through its Requests for Production. Code of Civil Procedure section 94, limits the total number of interrogatories, demands to produce documents, and requests for admission to 35. (Code Civ. Proc., § 94, subd. (a).) Based on both these grounds, the Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and for Sanctions is denied.ConclusionPlaintiff Nekuryan Property Investment, LLC’s Motion Compelling Responses to Requests for Production and for Sanctions is GRANTED AS TO THE RESPONSES AND DENIED AS TO THE SANCTIONS. DEFENDANT NOGA ASSIL IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES WITHOUT OBJECTION TO THE REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.Plaintiff Nekuryan Property Investment, LLC’s Motion to Deem Requests for Admission Admitted and for Sanctions is DENIED.Moving party to give notice.
