And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has ruled on two motions filed by the plaintiff, Nekuryan Property Investment, LLC. The first motion is to compel the defendant, Noga Assil, to respond to requests for production of documents and to award sanctions against the defendant for failing to respond. The judge has granted this motion as to the request for responses, but denied the request for sanctions.

The second motion is to deem requests for admission admitted and to award sanctions against the defendant for failing to respond. The judge has denied this motion because the plaintiff did not demonstrate that the requests for admission were served on the defendant, and because the plaintiff has propounded the maximum number of written discovery requests permitted in the limited jurisdiction court.

In summary, the defendant is required to serve verified responses to the requests for production within 20 days of the order, but will not be required to pay sanctions. The motion to deem requests for admission admitted is denied.
