Holder et al.,TENTATIVE RULING:Petitioners Daniel Garza and Angela Dejesus’ Motion for Attorney Fees is DENIED.ANALYSIS:On November 27, 2023, Petitioners Daniel Garza and Angela Dejesus (“Petitioners”) filed the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award against Respondents Lisa Holder, Esq. and Law Offices of Lisa Holder (“Respondents”). Following the initial hearing on April 22, 2024, the Court continued the matter to allow for service of the papers on Respondent Law Offices of Lisa Holder. (Minute Order, 04/22/24.) At the next hearing on June 24, 2024, the Court found service on Respondents had been completed and granted the Petition in favor of Petitioners. (Minute Order, 06/24/24.)Respondents filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the order granting the Petition, which the Court denied on August 15, 2024. (Minute Order, 08/15/24.) Judgment was entered in Petitioners favor on October 4, 2024.Petitioners filed the instant Motion for Attorney Fees on October 28, 2024. No opposition was filed by the required deadline. DiscussionThe Motion for Attorney Fees is not brought pursuant to any legal authority, as required by the Code of Civil Procedure and California Rules of Court. (Motion, p. 1.) “Notices must be in writing, and the notice of a motion, other than for a new trial, must state when, and the grounds upon which it will be made, and the papers, if any, upon which it is to be based.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.) “The memorandum must contain a statement of facts, a concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases, and textbooks cited in support of the position advanced.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(b).) Indeed, Petitioners’ failure to provide a memorandum as required by the Rule is an “admission that the [request] is without merit and cause for its denial.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1113(a), (b); In re Marriage of Falcone & Fyke (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 964, 976.)Without any noticed basis for the Motion or supporting memorandum of points and authorities, the Court cannot grant the relief requested.ConclusionPetitioners Daniel Garza and Angela Dejesus’ Motion for Attorney Fees is DENIED.Court clerk to give notice.
