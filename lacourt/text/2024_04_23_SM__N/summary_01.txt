And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Michael H. Weiss's motion to redact portions of the Notice of Petition and Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award and Enter Judgment in Conformance with the Award. The judge finds that the public right of access to the record exists to allow the public to understand the court's decision-making process. Since the parties stipulated to rescind and vacate the arbitration award, which renders the award moot and irrelevant, the continued presence of the award in the record is now misleading. The judge finds that sealing the documents at issue is proper, as it is narrowly tailored and does not infringe on the public's right to access court records.
