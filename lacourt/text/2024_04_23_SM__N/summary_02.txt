And here is the summary in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion to compel the plaintiff's attendance at deposition without prejudice. The defendants, Wood of Chiu Living Trust, Roman Chiu, and Abby Wood, had moved the court for an order to compel the deposition of the plaintiff, Marcelino Arcos, on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to appear for deposition. The defendants represented that they had served a notice of deposition on the plaintiff on January 4, 2024, but the deposition did not go forward as noticed on January 22, 2024, because the plaintiff failed to appear. The court found that the defendants were entitled to take the plaintiff's deposition, but the defendants failed to provide a meet-and-confer declaration, which is required by statute. The court denied the defendants' motion without prejudice, meaning that the defendants may re-file the motion with the required declaration.
