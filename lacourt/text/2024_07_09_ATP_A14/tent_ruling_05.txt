 Case Number:  24AVCV00237    Hearing Date:   July 9, 2024    Dept:  A14 Background
 
This is a quiet title action. Plaintiff Clearview Real Estate Holdings,
LLC (“Plaintiff”) alleges presents that the real property at issue is commonly
known as 1741 Viridian Ave., Lancaster, CA 93534 and provides the legal
description in Exhibit A of the Complaint (the “Subject Property). Plaintiff further
presents that it is the current and true legal and equitable titleholder to the
Subject Property by way of a perfected and duly recorded trustee’s deed upon
sale; Defendant Amir Aki Shaheed-Edwards (“Shaheed-Edwards”) is the former
borrower under that certain deed of trust dated September 16, 2019, and
recorded in the Official Records of Los Angeles County as Document Number
20190977291 and has no valid right, title, lien, or interest in the Subject
Property; and that Defendant Society Ventures LLC (“Society Ventures”) claims
to have a lien interest in the Subject Property through the fraudulent use of a
UCC Financing Statement recorded against the Subject Property which was
recorded as Document Number 20230558836 on or about August 22, 2023, but has no
valid right to title, lien or interest in the Subject Property as UCC Financing
Statement cannot create a security interest in real property. Plaintiff seeks
to quiet title and cancel clouds on title on the Subject Property.
 
On February 27, 2024, Plaintiff filed its Complaint alleging three causes
of action for: (1) Quiet Title, (2) Cancellation of Instrument, and (3) Slander
of Title. 
 
 
On February 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed an Amendment to Complaint, amending
the fictitious name of Doe 1 to Diane Merritt and a Notice of Lis Pendens. 
 
On March 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed an Amendment to Complaint, amending
the fictitious name of Doe 2 to Amir Aki Shaheed-Edwards dba Bait Califa Trust.
 
On April 02, 2024, Society Ventures filed a Request to Waive Court Fees,
subsequently denied. 
 
On April 05, 2024, Society Ventures filed a Motion to Quash Service. The
Motion to Quash Service was voided on May 07, 2024 as Society Ventures, a
corporation, was trying to proceed in pro per with an individual non-attorney
representing it. (See CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004)
120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146 [“A corporation has the capacity to bring a lawsuit
because it has all the powers of a natural person in carrying out its business.
However, under a long-standing common law rule of procedure, a corporation,
unlike a natural person, cannot represent itself before courts of record in
propria persona, nor can it represent itself through a corporate officer,
director or other employee who is not an attorney. It must be represented by
licensed counsel in proceedings before courts of record.”].)
 
On April 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed an Ex Parte Application for Temporary
Restraining Order Prohibiting Defendants from Encumbering/Transferring Real
Property, subsequently granted on April 19, 2024.
 
On April 19, 2024, Plaintiff requested default as to Society Ventures,
LLC. The Court set an Order to Show Cause (“OSC”) regarding entry of default on
Society Ventures for April 30, 2024. 
 
On April 26, 2024, the Court held a hearing on an OSC titled, “OSC RE: Why
A Preliminary Injunction Should Not Issue Cancelling the March 4, 2024
Trustee's Deed Upon Sale In Favor of Defendant Society Ventures, LLC, Recorded
Against the Subject Property, Recorded In the Los Angeles County Recorder's
Office.” There were no appearances. At this hearing, the Court advanced and
vacated the OSC regarding entry of default on Society Ventures and continued it
to June 24, 2024 at 08:30 AM in Department A14 at Michael Antonovich Antelope
Valley Courthouse. The Court gave notice of the change. 
 
On May 06, 2024, Shaheed-Edwards filed his Answer. 
 
On June 24, 2024, the OSC regarding entry of default on Society Ventures
was held. 
 
On June 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed its Opposition.
 
On July 02, 2024, Society Ventures
filed its Reply. “. .
.[A]ll reply papers [shall be filed with the court and a copy served on each
party] at least five court days before the hearing.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
1005(b).) “Section 1013, which extends the time within which a right may be
exercised or an act may be done, does not apply to a notice of motion, papers
opposing a motion, or reply papers governed by this section.” (Ibid.)
The hearing is set for July 09, 2024. July 04, 2024 is a national holiday resulting
in court closure. As such, five court days before the hearing is July 01, 2024.
A Reply should have been filed by July 01, 2024 to be timely. The Reply is untimely.
“No paper may be rejected for filing on the ground that it was untimely
submitted for filing. If the court, in its discretion, refuses to consider a
late filed paper, the minutes or order must so indicate.” (Cal. Rules of Court,
Rule 3.1300(d).) The Court, in its discretion, does not consider the late filed
Reply.

Legal Standard
 
Standard to Quash Service – Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. § 418.10 provides: 
 
A
defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any
further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a
notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes: 
 
(1) To quash service
of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or
her. 
(2) To stay or
dismiss the action on the ground of inconvenient forum. 
(3) To dismiss the
action pursuant to the applicable provisions of Chapter 1.5 (commencing with
Section 583.110) of Title 8. 
 
“When a defendant challenges the court's personal jurisdiction on the
ground of improper service of process ‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove
the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an
effective service.’ ” (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th
403,413; see also Sheard v. Superior Court (1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 207, 211
[“. . .where a defendant properly moves to quash service of summons the burden
is on the plaintiff to prove facts requisite to the effective service.”].) 
 
Chapter 1.5 provides the Court with the discretionary ability to dismiss
for delay in prosecution pursuant to this article on its own motion or on
motion of the defendant if to do so appears to the court appropriate under the
circumstances of the case. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 583.410.)

Discussion
 
Application – The Court notes that there is a
Proof of Service that is signed by a registered process server. (See Proof of
Substituted Service). This creates a presumption of service. (See Cal. Evid.
Code § 647.)
 
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 415.20, which discusses substituted service
provides: 
 
(a) In lieu of
personal delivery of a copy of the summons and complaint to the person to be
served as specified in Section 416.10, 416.20, 416.30, 416.40, or 416.50, a
summons may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint during
usual office hours in his or her office or, if no physical address is known, at
his or her usual mailing address, other than a United States Postal Service
post office box, with the person who is apparently in charge thereof, and by
thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and complaint by first-class mail,
postage prepaid to the person to be served at the place where a copy of the
summons and complaint were left. When service is effected by leaving a copy of
the summons and complaint at a mailing address, it shall be left with a person
at least 18 years of age, who shall be informed of the contents thereof.
Service of a summons in this manner is deemed complete on the 10th day after
the mailing. 
 
(b) If a copy of the
summons and complaint cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered
to the person to be served, as specified in Section 416.60, 416.70, 416.80, or
416.90, a summons may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint
at the person’s dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business,
or usual mailing address other than a United States Postal Service post office
box, in the presence of a competent member of the household or a person
apparently in charge of his or her office, place of business, or usual mailing
address other than a United States Postal Service post office box, at least 18
years of age, who shall be informed of the contents thereof, and by thereafter
mailing a copy of the summons and of the complaint by first-class mail, postage
prepaid to the person to be served at the place where a copy of the summons and
complaint were left. Service of a summons in this manner is deemed complete on
the 10th day after the mailing. 
 
(c) Notwithstanding
subdivision (b), if the only address reasonably known for the person to be
served is a private mailbox obtained through a commercial mail receiving
agency, service of process may be effected on the first delivery attempt by
leaving a copy of the summons and complaint with the commercial mail receiving
agency in the manner described in subdivision (d) of Section 17538.5 of the
Business and Professions Code. 
 
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 415.40, discussing out of state service
provides: 
 
A summons may be
served on a person outside this state in any manner provided by this article or
by sending a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the person to be
served by first-class mail, postage prepaid, requiring a return receipt.
Service of a summons by this form of mail is deemed complete on the 10th day
after such mailing. 
 
The Court emphasizes that Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 415.40 allows service on
a person outside of this state (1) in any manner provided by this article or
(2) by sending a copy of the summons and of the complaint to the person to be
served by first-class mail, postage prepaid, requiring a return receipt.
Accordingly, the Court must take into consideration all allowed methods under
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 415.10-416.3, which discuss manner of service of
summons.  
 
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 415.30 allows service by mail in a similar fashion
to the second alternative allowed in Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 415.40: 
 
A summons may be
served by mail as provided in this section. A copy of the summons and of the
complaint shall be mailed (by first-class mail or airmail, postage prepaid) to
the person to be served, together with two copies of the notice and
acknowledgment provided for in subdivision (b) and a return envelope, postage
prepaid, addressed to the sender. 
 
(Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 415.30(a).) 
 
Though there are differences between the two Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§
415.30 and 415.40, the Court finds case law on Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 415.30
helpful for the issue of whether PO box service is allowed by code: 
 
The Judicial Council
comment following Code of Civil Procedure section 415.50 states service by mail
is not required "where a defendant's whereabouts and his dwelling house or
usual place of abode, etc. cannot be ascertained with reasonable diligence."
(Judicial Council of Cal. com., Deering's Ann. Code Civ. Proc. (1991 ed.) §
415.50, p. 676.) However, we do not read this comment to exclude service by
mail in the instant case. Although respondent could not ascertain appellant's
"dwelling house or usual place of abode," we believe the post office
box falls into the "etc." category. (See Donel Inc. v. Badalian
(1978) 87 Cal. App. 3d 327 [150 Cal. Rptr. 855] [where mailing of summons is
reasonably feasible, any method of service less likely to provide actual notice
is insufficient]; Mullane v. Central Hanover Tr. Co. (1950)  339
U.S. 306, 315-318 [94 L. Ed. 865, 873-876, 70 S. Ct. 652] [for the same
proposition]; see also U.S. v. $84,740.00 U.S. Currency (9th Cir. 1990)
900 F.2d 1402 [in addition to service by publication, the government served
defendants with a forfeiture complaint by sending two certified letters to
defendants' post office box].) 
 
Our finding a post
office box is a sufficient address for compliance with Code of Civil Procedure
section 415.30 also is supported by case law interpreting the statutory
predecessor to Code of Civil Procedure section 415.50. Former Code of Civil
Procedure section 413 required "a copy of the summons and complaint to be
forthwith deposited in the post office, directed to the person to be served, at
his place of residence. . . ." (Italics added.) At least two courts
defined the term "residence" not as the defendant's abode, but rather
as "the address at which letters would be most likely to reach the
defendant." ( Sousa v. Freitas (1970) 10 Cal. App. 3d 660, 663 [89
Cal. Rptr. 485]; cf. San Diego Sav. Bank v. Goodsell (1902) 137 Cal.
420, 427 [70 P. 299].) 
 
This interpretation
of "residence" is relevant to our holding a post office box is a
sufficient address for service under Code of Civil Procedure 415.30 because it
demonstrates how statutory language and judicial comments should be read to
achieve the statute's fundamental objective of serving notice on the defendant.
Whenever possible, a statute should be interpreted as broadly as necessary to
effectuate the statute's purpose. (See generally, S.E.C. v. Rana Research,
Inc. (9th Cir. 1993) 8 F.3d 1358, 1362 [interpreting language in Securities
and Exchange Commision rule 10b-5 as broadly and as flexibly as necessary to
accomplish the statute's purpose]; cf. Western Oil & Gas Assn. v.
Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control Dist. (1989) 49 Cal. 3d 408, 425
[261 Cal. Rptr. 384, 777 P.2d 157] [where a statute has two possible
interpretations, courts should apply the more reasonable of the two].) 
 
(Transamerica Title Ins. Co. v. Hendrix (1995) 34 Cal. App. 4th
740, 745-46.) 
 
Thus, it appears
when taking case law, statute, and the context of the mailed service into
consideration, that Plaintiff has not effected service in a way that is
authorized by California law. That is, Plaintiff has sent a copy of the summons
and of the complaint to Diane Merrit at an address that is not associated with
Society Ventures. The address associated with Society Ventures is 3500 Lennox
Rd., Atlanta, GA 30326. (See Stewart Decl. 3, Exh. B.)
 
The Court notes that
the declaration provided by Jessie Stewart (“Stewart”), the manager of Society
Ventures, states that Diane Merritt’s only authority was to conduct the trustee
sales related to the Subject Property and Diane Merrit has no connection with
the 8549 Wilshire Blvd. address other than its association with the one time public/private
lien sale pursuant to UCC. (See Stewart Decl. ¿¿ 5-7.) Service on a corporation
must be to (1) the person designated as agent for service of process as
provided by any provision in Section 202, 1502, 2105, or 2107 of the
Corporations Code (or Sections 3301 to 3303, inclusive, or Sections 6500 to
6504, inclusive, of the Corporations Code, as in effect on December 31, 1976,
with respect to corporations to which they remain applicable); (2) the
president, chief executive officer, or other head of the corporation, a vice
president, a secretary or assistant secretary, a treasurer or assistant
treasurer, a controller or chief financial officer, a general manager, or a
person authorized by the corporation to receive service of process.; (3)
if the corporation
is a bank, to a cashier or assistant cashier or to a person specified in
subdivision (a) or (b); and (4) if authorized by any provision in Section 1701,
1702, 2110, or 2111 of the Corporations Code (or Sections 3301 to 3303,
inclusive, or Sections 6500 to 6504, inclusive, of the Corporations Code, as in
effect on December 31, 1976, with respect to corporations to which they remain
applicable), as provided by that provision. (See Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
416.10.) The registered agent for Society Ventures is Stewart. (See Stewart
Decl. 3, Exh. B.)
Plaintiff’s
Opposition, including the requests for judicial notice, does not address
Society Venture’s Georgia address or its agent for service of process on file
with Georgia’s Secretary of State. As such, Plaintiff’s Opposition does not
affect the Court’s analysis. 
As presented, the
Summons and Complaint have been (1) served on an individual that is not
authorized to accept service on behalf of Society Ventures in violation of Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 416.10; (2) served at an in-state address by mail only in
violation of Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 415.40. Service; and served at an address
that is not associated with Society Ventures.
  
Accordingly, the Motion is GRANTED.  
 
----- 
 
Conclusion
 
Specially
appearing defendant Society Ventures, LLC’s Motion to Quash Service of Summons
and Complaint is GRANTED.
