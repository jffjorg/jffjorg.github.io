And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Antelope Valley Union High School District's (AVUHSD) motion for judgment on the pleadings. AVUHSD argued that AB 218, a California law that allows victims of childhood sexual abuse to file claims, is unconstitutional and that the plaintiff's claim is barred by the statute of limitations. The judge found that AVUHSD's arguments were without merit and that the law is constitutional. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's claim is timely and that AVUHSD is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The case will proceed to the next stage.
