 Case Number:  23AVCV00526    Hearing Date:   July 9, 2024    Dept:  A14 Background
 
This is a quiet action. Plaintiff
Charles D. Shea (“Plaintiff”) presents that the real property at issue is
commonly known as 43827 Chaparral Drive, Lancaster, CA 93536 (the “Subject
Property”). Plaintiff alleges that Defendants Lito Vales (“Lito”)[1]
and Vicki Vales (“Vicki” and collectively “the Vales”) took title to the
Subject Property from Lancaster Palms, LLC by as joint tenants by way of a
Grant Deed recorded on August 18, 2006, as Document No. 06-1842986, that the
Vales refinanced the Subject Property numerous times, and the Vales deeded
their interest in the Subject Property to Plaintiff as his sole and separate
property, by way of a Grant Deed which recorded in on April 16, 2018 as
Document No. 20180363739. Plaintiff presents that his spouse, Kim Marie
Rosas-Shea, deeded her interest in the Property to Plaintiff by way of an
Interspousal Transfer Grant Deed (“IGD”) which recorded in on April 16, 2018 as
Document No. 20180363738. Plaintiff further alleges that he obtained a loan in
the amount of $244,000.00 from CrossCountry Mortgage, Inc. with MERS as nominee
for Lender and Lender’s successors and assigns, secured by 43827 Chaparral
Drive, Lancaster CA 93536 by way of a deed of trust recorded on April 16, 2018
as Document No. 20180363740. Plaintiff contends that the Vales did not disclose
that there was any other prior deed of trust encumbering the Subject Property,
but Defendant Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC (“SLS”) and its
predecessors-in-interest contend that here is a prior deed of trust securing a
loan to the Vales in the amount of $58,000.00 from lender Countrywide Bank,
N.A. with MERS as nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors and assigns, which
was recorded on October 23, 2006, as Document No. 06-2340701 with the correct
common description of the Subject Property, but incorrect Assessor Parcel
Number (“APN”). Hereinafter, this deed of trust will be addressed as the 2006
DOT. Plaintiff believes that the deed of trust at issue is related to the
Vales’ other property, commonly known as 3523 W Avenue K4, Lancaster, CA 93536.
From this deed of trust, Plaintiff alleges that (1) an Assignment of Deed of
Trust (as to the 2006 DOT) was recorded on July 18, 2019 as Document No.
20190699535 containing the common property address with the incorrect APN; (2) a
second Assignment of Deed of Trust was recorded on August 11, 2022 as Document
No. 20220810290 containing the common property address with the incorrect APN;
(3) on or about January 25, 2023, a Notice of Default pertaining to the Prior
DOT was recorded as Document No. 20230050193, containing the correct common
address and APN; and (4) on April 28, 2023, a Notice of Trustee Sale pertaining
to the Prior DOT was recorded as Document No. 20230276620, containing the
correct common address and APN, subsequently occurred, affecting the Subject
Property. Plaintiff contends that he is a bone fide purchaser. Plaintiff seeks
to quiet title, cancel the 2006 DOT, and declaratory relief. 
 
On May 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed

Legal Standard
 
Standard for Summary Judgment – The function of a motion for summary
judgment or adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing
party cannot show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an
order of summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co.¿(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Cal. Code Civ. Proc.¿§437c(c)
“requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to¿any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.”¿ (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)¿“The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary
judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits
or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact
within the issues delimited by the pleadings.”¿ (Juge¿v. County of Sacramento¿(1993)
12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67 (“Juge”), citing¿FPI Development, Inc. v.
Nakashima¿(1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 367, 381-382.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
As to each claim as framed by the complaint,
the party moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof
by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to establish a defense.
(Cal.¿Code Civ.¿Proc.¿§437c(p)(2);¿Scalf¿v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc.¿(2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support
of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the
evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006)
39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
Once the defendant has met that burden, the
burden shifts to the opposing party to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. To
establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must
produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v.¿Paetkau¿(1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)¿¿¿

Discussion
 
Application – At the
crux of Plaintiff’s arguments related to the First Cause of Action (Quiet
Title) and Second Cause of Action (Cancellation of Instrument) is Plaintiff’s
assertion that he is a bona fide purchaser. 
 
“A buyer is a bona fide purchaser
if it bought property in good faith, for value, and had no knowledge or notice
of the asserted rights of another.” (612 South LLC v. Laconic Limited
Partnership (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1278; Melendrez v. D & I
Investment, Inc. (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1238, 1251.) “The first element
does not require that the buyer's consideration be the fair market value of the
property (or anything approaching it). (Citation.) Instead, the buyer need only
part with something of value in exchange for the property. (Citation.)” (Melendrez
v. D & I Investment, Inc., supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 1251.) “The
determination whether a party is a good faith purchaser or encumbrancer for
value ordinarily is a question of fact; on appeal, that determination will not
be reversed unless it is unsupported by substantial evidence.” (Triple A
Management Co., Inc. v. Frisone (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 520, 536.)
 
“The general rule places the
burden of proof upon a person claiming bona fide purchaser status to present
evidence that he or she acquired interest in the property without notice of the
prior interest. [Citations.]” (First Fidelity Thrift & Loan Assn. v.
Alliance Bank (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1433, 1442.) 
 
Here, there is no presentation of
what Plaintiff parted with for the Subject Property. Rather, Plaintiff has not
only alleged that he was deeded the Subject Property in the Complaint (see
Complaint ¶ 11)[2],
but also evidenced that it was deeded to him through his attached declaration
(see Compendium of Evidence, Tab 11, Decl. of Plaintiff ¶ 3[“Defendants Lito
Vales and Vicki Vales (collectively, “the Vales”) transferred the real property
commonly known as 43827 Chaparral Drive, Lancaster CA 93536 (the “Chaparral
Property”) to me by way of a Grant Deed which recorded on April 16, 2018
bearing Document No. 20180363739. I am the current owner of the Chaparral
Property. A true and correct copy of the Grant Deed is incorporated herein by
reference and attached to Compendium of Evidence as Tab 2”].) While Plaintiff
presents that he paid value for the Subject Property, Plaintiff relies only on:
(1) the Grant Deed, and (2) a subsequent loan in the amount of $244,000.00 from
CrossCountry Mortgage, Inc. secured by a Deed of Trust. (See Motion for Summary
Judgment 6:22-26; Compendium of Evidence, Tab 11, Decl. of Plaintiff ¶ 5.) While
Plaintiff states that he pai value for the Subject Property in his declaration
(see Compendium of Evidence, Tab 11, Decl. of Plaintiff ¶ 5), what has been
presented to the Court is that (1) the Subject Property was deeded to Plaintiff
by the Vales (id. at ¶ 3, and Tab 2); (2) Plaintiff’s spouse deeded any
interest in the Subject Property to him through an Interspousal Transfer Grant
Deed (id. at ¶ 4, and Tab 3); and (3) a subsequent loan in the amount of
$244,000.00 was obtained from CrossCountry Mortgage, Inc. and secured by the
Subject Property (id. at ¶ 5, and Tab 4). There has been neither a presentation
of evidence that value was exchanged for the Subject Property between the
Plaintiff and the previous owners, the Vales nor a foundation laid for a grant
deed to qualify as a purchase or exchange of value. 
 
Thus, Plaintiff has not met his
burden to show that he is a bona fide purchaser and so his arguments for the
First Cause of Action (Quiet Title) and Second Cause of Action (Cancellation of
Instrument) fail. 
 
Plaintiff’s argument for the
Third Cause of Action (Declaratory Relief) is that it is undisputed that the
2006 DOT was not recorded in the Subject Property’s chain of title giving
Plaintiff constructive notice; and (2) Plaintiff purchased the Subject Property
without any notice of the existence of the Prior DOT or Defendants’ claimed
interest in the Prior DOT. 
 
As discussed, ante, there
is an issue as to whether Plaintiff purchased the Subject Property. The Third
Cause of Action (Declaratory Relieve) is derivative of Plaintiff’s other
claims. As Plaintiff has not met his burden for both the First Cause of Action
(Quiet Title) and Second Cause of Action (Cancellation of Instrument), the
derivative Third Cause of Action (Declaratory Relief) fails.
 
Accordingly, the Motion for
Summary Judgment is DENIED.
 
The Motion for Summary
Adjudication is DENIED.
