  Case Number:  21AVCV00911    Hearing Date:   July 9, 2024    Dept:  A14 Background
 
This is a case for damages for
breach of express and implied warranty. Plaintiffs Jack Violante and Agnes
Violante (“Plaintiffs”) allege that on May 24, 2016, they purchased Defendant
Jayco, Inc. (“Defendant”) new motor home described as a 2017 Jayco Allante 31V,
bearing vehicle identification number 1F65F5DY3G0A113S0 (“the Vehicle”) for
approximately $185,617.00. Plaintiffs further allege that at the time of the
purchase, the motor home was covered by both Jayco’s express limited warranty
covering two years or 24,000 miles whichever occurred first and an implied
warranty of merchantability that the motor home was fit for its ordinary
intended purposes. Plaintiffs present that within the warranty periods,
Plaintiffs had on at least four occasions taken the motor home in for repairs. Plaintiffs
contend neither Jayco nor its authorized service and repair facilities were
able to repair the above-described defects, malfunctions and/or nonconformities
so as to make the motor home conform to the limited warranty despite being
given a reasonable number of repair opportunities.
 
On January 21, 2022, Defendant
filed their Motion to Stay the Action Pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §

On February 22,
2022, the hearing on the Motion to Stay the Action for Inconvenient Forum was
held. The Court took the matter under submission and denied the Motion to Stay
the Action for Inconvenient Forum without prejudice and held that, if
submitted, the Court will grant a Motion to Stay the Action Pursuant to Cal.

Analysis
 
Standard for Forum Non Conveniens/Forum Selection
Clauses – “Forum non conveniens is an equitable
doctrine, codified in Code of Civil Procedure section 410.30, under which a
trial court has discretion to stay or dismiss a transitory cause of action that
it believes may be more appropriately and justly tried elsewhere. [citation]
The inquiry is whether ‘in the interest of substantial justice an action should
be heard in a forum outside this state.’ (Code Civ. Proc., § 410.30, subd.
(a).” (Animal Film, LLC v. D.E.J. Productions, Inc.
(2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 466, 471 (“Animal Film”).)
 
Cal. Code
Civ. Proc. § 410.30 provides that “[w]hen a court upon motion of a party or its
own motion finds that in the interest of substantial justice an action should
be heard in a forum outside this state, the court shall stay or dismiss the
action in whole or in part on any conditions that may be just.” (Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. § 410.30(a).) This action may be served by a defendant on or before the
last day of his time to plead or within any further time that the court may for
good cause allow. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. 
§ 418.10(a)(2).) However, the provisions of Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
418.10 do not apply to a motion to stay an action by a defendant who has made a
general appearance. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 410.30(b).) Rather, as Section
410.30 does not state a limit, a reasonableness standard is necessarily
inferred. (Trident Labs, Inc. v. Merrill Lynch Commercial Finance Corp.
(2011) 200 Cal. App.4th 147, 155.)
 
Ordinarily,
a court must (1) determine whether the alternate forum is a “suitable” place
for trial; if it is, the court must next (2) consider the private interests of
the litigants and the interests in the public in retaining the action for trial
in California. (Stangik v. Shiley (1991) 54 Cal.3d 744, 751.) Such
private interests include those that make trial and enforceability of the
ensuring judgment expeditious and relatively inexpensive, such as the ease of
access to sources of proof; the cost of obtaining attendance of witnesses and
the availability of a compulsory process for attendance of unwilling witnesses.
(Id.) As to the public interest, relevant factors include avoidance of
overburdening local courts with congested calendars; protecting the interests
of potential jurors so they are not called upon to decide cases in which the
local community has little concern; and weighing the interests of California
and the alternate jurisdiction in the litigation. (Id.)
 
“In a
contract dispute in which the parties' agreement contains a forum selection
clause, a threshold issue in a forum non conveniens motion is whether the forum
selection clause is mandatory or permissive. A mandatory clause ordinarily is
‘given effect without any analysis of convenience; the only question is whether
enforcement of the clause would be unreasonable.’ But, if ‘the clause merely
provides for submission to jurisdiction and does not expressly mandate
litigation exclusively in a particular forum, then the traditional forum non
conveniens analysis applies.’” (Animal Film, supra, at 471.)
 
The
burden is typically on the party seeking to avoid enforcement of a forum
selection clause to show that its enforcement would be unreasonable. (Drulias
v. 1st Century Bancshares, Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 696, 703.) However,
the burden is reversed when the claims at issue are based on unwaivable rights
created by California statutes; in those circumstances, the party seeking to
enforce the forum selection clause bears the burden to
show that litigating the claims in the contractually designated forum will not
diminish in any way substantive rights afforded under California law. (Id.;
see also Verdugo v. Alliantgroup L.P. (2015) 237
Cal.App.4th 141, 147-48 (“Verdugo”).)

Discussion
 
Application – Plaintiffs
present that the settlement agreement provided that (1) at Plaintiffs’ election
the amount of fees and costs may be determined by noticed motion under Cal.
Civ. Code § 1794(d), (2) Plaintiffs will be considered the prevailing party;
and, (3) the court will retain jurisdiction to enforce its fee order under Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6. (Decl. James S. Kostas (“Kostas”) ¶ 10.) Defendant
does not dispute this presentation. 
 
Plaintiffs argue that, as this
case is a Song-Beverly case, the lodestar method should be utilized. Plaintiffs
next present that Kostas’ hourly rate of $575.00 per hour (see Decl. Kostas ¶ 18) is reasonable; the claimed 155.5 hours is
reasonable (see Decl. Kostas ¶¶ 20, 30); that the lodestar amount should be
adjusted upwards by a 0.5 multiplier due to the contingent nature of the
representation and the delay in receiving payment; that Plaintiffs are entitled
to attorney’s fees in the amount of $140,342.00; and that Plaintiffs are
entitled to their costs in the amount of $2,366.00.
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiffs’
counsel has not produced detailed billing records which prevents Defendant’s
counsel, James P. Schratz (“Schratz”), and the Court from analyzing billing;
the attorney fee provision in the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act on which
Plaintiffs base their claim for fees (Civil Code § 1794(d) is different from
virtually all other statutory fee-shifting provisions in that the Song-Beverly
Act explicitly ties any award of fees to “actual time expended” and case law
that has awarded fees under the Song-Beverly Act based upon general billing
categories could not be found; and Plaintiffs seek billing of paralegal work
without identifying the paralegal, showing that the paralegal fulfills the
requirements of a paralegal as set forth in Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §
6450(c)-(d), and the tasks described as having being performed by the paralegal
are clerical in nature and not compensable. Defendant further presents that the
appeal in this case was not necessary and Plaintiffs’ opening brief appeared to
be duplicative of the oppositions filed with this Court. Defendant contends
that the 0.50 multiplier is unjustified based on the issues and the fact that
Plaintiff filed only four substantive pleadings. Defendant presents that
reasonably incurred attorney fees amount only to $41,860.00.
 
Plaintiffs argue that Kostas used
the billing method allowed by Syers Properties III, Inc. v. Rankin
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691 (“Syers”) which does not constitute block
billing and does not prevent a determination of whether the time claimed for
each category is reasonable or necessary and that Defendant concedes that block
billing is not prohibited in California. Plaintiffs present that the Syers
court approved the method of billing being used and the method is useful in
cases such as these, that the lodestar method is used in Song-Beverly cases,
and that Song-Beverly’s actual time expended standard does not exclude the
documentation method in Syers. Plaintiffs next argue that the timing of
the settlement (i.e., during the appeals process) is irrelevant as Defendant
had control over when the case settled and the statement that Plaintiffs’
appellate opening brief is duplicative is without support. Plaintiffs finally
argue that a multiplier is appropriate due to the contingent nature of
representation and delay in receiving payment, and a memorandum of costs is a
technical argument that should not bar recovery of costs as the costs are being
claimed as part of a settlement which includes recovery of reasonable costs and
no specific method for claiming costs is called for, that there has not been an
entry of judgment or dismissal, and that Plaintiffs’ filings are verified by
Kostas. 
 
The
Court notes that no Memorandum of Costs has been filed. Rather, Kostas has
filed this Motion for Attorney Fees with a declaration summarizing his billing.

The
Court notes that the only filings at this Court in this case have been: (1) the
Complaint, (2) an ex parte application directing the Court to direct the filing
date to the date the Complaint was initially presented for electronic filing,
(3) a 170.6 motion which Plaintiffs sought to withdraw, (4) an Answer, (5) a
motion to stay due to the forum, (6) a second motion to stay due to the forum,
and (7) this motion. Plaintiffs’ appealed the Court’s order on the second
motion to stay, subsequently dismissing the appeal. The appeal states clearly
“[E]ach party shall bear its own costs on appeal.” (See June 01, 2023
Remittitur.) 
 
The
Court does not find this case novel. 
 
Based
on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Motion for Attorney Fees in the amount
of $41,860.00.

Conclusion
 
Plaintiffs Jack Violante and Agnes Violante’s Motion
for Award of Attorney Fees and Costs is GRANTED in the amount of $41,860.00.
