Legal Standard
 
Standard for Judgment on the Pleadings – A defendant may move for judgment on the
pleadings only when: a motion for judgment on the pleadings may only be made on
one of the following grounds: (1) the court has no jurisdiction of the subject
of the cause of action alleged in the complaint; or (2) the complaint does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 438(c)(1).)¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A motion for judgment on the pleadings
challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading’s allegations, not their
veracity. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968,
994.) Thus, a motion for judgment on the pleadings is the functional equivalent
of a general demurrer. (Lance Camper Mfg. Corp. v. Republic Indemnity Co. of
Am. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194, 198; see also Cloud
v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 995, 999 [“A motion for judgment on the pleadings performs the same
function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the
face of the pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed.
Presentation of extrinsic evidence is therefore not proper on a motion for
judgment on the pleadings.”].)¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
The standard for ruling on a
motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable
to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of the pleadings, together with
matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. (Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322 [citing Schabarum v. California Legislature
(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216].)¿Any defects must either appear on the face of the pleading, or else be
taken by judicial notice. (Id. at 321-22.) The parties’ ability to prove
their respective claims is of no concern. (Cloud, supra, 67
Cal.App.4th 995 at 999.) Though the Court must accept the allegations of the
complaint and answer as true (Gerawan Farming, Inc. v. Lyons (2000) 24
Cal.4th 468, 515), it will not do so for “conclusions of law or fact, opinions,
speculation, or allegations contrary to law or [judicially noticed] facts. . .”
(Stevenson Real Estate Servs., Inc. v. CB Richard Ellis Real Estate Servs.,
Inc. (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1219–20.)¿¿

Discussion
 
Application – AVUHSD
brings this MJOP under the basis that AB 218 is unconstitutional. Specifically,
AVUHSD argues that (1) AB 218 amended the statute of limitations for claims of
childhood sexual abuse codified at Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1 by (1)
eliminating the language in Section 905(m) declaring the exemption only applied
to claims arising from conduct occurring after January 1, 2009 and (2) added
subdivision (p) to Section 905, stating that the changes made to the statute
“are retroactive….”, thereby violating the California Constitution. AVUHSD
believes that the California Constitution has been violated based on the
holdings in Conlin v. Bd. of Supervisors (1893) 99 Cal. 17 (“Conlin”),
Bourn v. Hart (1892) 93 Cal. 321, and Powell v. Phelan (1903) 138
Cal. 271. These cases are presented by AVUHSD as precedent regarding the
constitutional prohibition on gifts of public funds. AVUSD further cites Jordan
v. Dep’t of Motor Vehicles (2002) 100 Cal. App. 4th 43 and presents that
its holding defines gifts in the constitutional contest as including all appropriations
of public money for which there is no authority or enforceable claim. AVUHSD
then discusses written claims and its applicability on a public agency. 
 
Plaintiff highlights that this
legislation was already addressed by California Appellate Courts in Coats v.
New Haven Unified School District (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 415 (“Coats”)
and held to be constitutional and that she has pled the requirements set out in
Shirk v. Vista Unified School District (2007) 42 Cal.4th 201. Plaintiff
highlights that the legislation does not deal with public funds and serves a
public purpose of assisting victims of childhood sexual abuse and punishing the
abusers. Plaintiff argues that AVUHSD does not cite any cases which hold that
reviving a lapsed claim or removing the claims presentation requirements
creates or imposes liability on a public entity and AVUHSD is, in essence,
asking the Court to usurp the Legislature. 
 
AVUHSD’s Reply reiterates the
claims presentation requirement, highlighting that prior to the passage of AB
218 Plaintiff did not have an enforceable claim. AVUHSD further argues that (1)
Coats does not address the underlying constitutional issue, (2) courts
are prohibited from carrying out legislative intent where the constitution
forbids such action, and (3) imposition of AB 218 serves no public purpose as a
matter of law. 
 
As an initial matter, Plaintiff
concedes in the Complaint that she is 35 years old. (Complaint ¶ 14.) Under
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. 340.1, Plaintiff’s claim is timely as “[i]n an action for
recovery of damages suffered as a result of childhood sexual assault, the time
for commencement of the action shall be within 22 years of the date the
plaintiff attains the age of majority or within five years of the date the
plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered that psychological
injury or illness occurring after the age of majority was caused by the sexual
assault, whichever period expires later” for actions against any person for
committing an act of sexual assault; actions for liability against any person
or entity who owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, if a wrongful or negligent
act by that person or entity was a legal cause of the childhood sexual assault
that resulted in the injury to the plaintiff; and actions for liability against
any person or entity if an intentional act by that person or entity was a legal
cause of the childhood sexual assault that resulted in the injury to the
plaintiff.. (See Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 340.1(a).)
 
Ordinarily, a governmental claim must be
presented to the local public entity within six months after accrual of the
cause of action (Cal. Gov. Code § 911.2(a)), and that accrual date is not
postponed or tolled during the claimant's minority. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §
352(a)). Thus, e.g., an 11-year-old child injured on a school playground due to
the negligent supervision of a school employee must present her governmental
claim within six months of the accident notwithstanding her status as a minor.
However, Cal. Gov. Code § 905 designates 13 classes of claims against local
public entities that are not subject to the claims procedures of the Government
Claims Act, Gov Code §§ 810-996.6. Among these exceptions are “[c]laims made
pursuant to Section 340.1of the Code of Civil Procedure for the recovery of
damages suffered as a result of childhood sexual assault.” (Cal. Gov. Code §
905(m).) Significantly, the present and applicable iteration of Gov. Code §
905(m) makes Cal. Gov. Code § 905(m) retroactive. (See Cal. Gov. Code §
905(p).) Plaintiff did not present a governmental claim under prior to filing
suit, nor was she required to do so. 
 
Recognizing that Plaintiff’s
Complaint is timely for purposes of the statute of limitations unless Cal. Code
Civ. Proc. § 340.1 and Cal. Gov. Code § 905(m) are found to be unenforceable
against it, AVUHSD claims that those provisions, as applied to it here, are
unconstitutional. There are, however, a plethora of California cases holding
that a legislature may constitutionally adopt a new statute of limitations that
effectively revives a civil claim previously barred by the former statute of
limitations. (See, e.g., Coats, supra, 46 Cal.App.5th 415, 425
[“Legislation reviving the statute of limitations on civil law claims does not
violate constitutional principles.”]; Deutsch v. Mosonic Homes of
California, Inc. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 748, 760-762 [statute reviving
certain claims of childhood sexual abuse otherwise barred by statutes of
limitations is not unconstitutional on its face under the due process clause]; 20th
Century Insurance Company v. Superior Court (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1247
[application of Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 340.9 (special earthquake statute) to
revive plaintiff's action did not impermissibly impair defendant's right of
contract or deny it substantive due process by the destruction of vested
contract rights]; Hellinger v. Farmers Group, Inc. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th
1049, 1061 [revival aspect of Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 340.9 is not
unconstitutional; “It has been established law for over a century that a
legislature may revive a civil claim that is barred by the statute of
limitations. The reason is that, in a civil case, there is no constitutional
right of repose.”]; Roman Catholic Bishop of Oakland v. Superior Court
(2020) 128 Cal.App.4th 1155 [statute reviving statute of limitations did not
violate ex post facto principles by reviving punitive damages claim].) The
former January 1, 2009 limitation was selected by the Legislature, itself, in
its 2009 version of Gov. Code § 905(m). (See 2009 version of Cal. Gov. Code §
905(m).)  
 
Notably, AVUHSD cites no case that has held
that the Legislature's enactment of the present version of Government Code §
905(m), eliminating the claim presentation requirement for all claims for
childhood sexual assaults, including those occurring prior to pre-January 1,
2009, is unconstitutional, and this Court is unwilling to make new law in this
area. Should AVUHSD wish to change the law in this area, it needs to address
that concern to the Legislature. 
 
Accordingly, the MJOP is DENIED.
