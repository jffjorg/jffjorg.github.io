And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 23STCV16675. The plaintiff alleges that defendants David Talasazan and Maya Talasazan entered into a three-year commercial lease in July 2022. The plaintiff further alleges that the defendants stopped paying rent, illegally stored marijuana on the premises, and damaged the premises. The court found that the plaintiff's first two causes of action (breach of contract and common counts) sufficiently allege causes of action. However, the court sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action (fraud) due to a lack of specificity. The defendants have 15 days to amend their cause of action, and must provide notice to the plaintiff.
