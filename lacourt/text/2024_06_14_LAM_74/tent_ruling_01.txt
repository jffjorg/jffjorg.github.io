  Case Number:  23STCV16675    Hearing Date:   June 14, 2024    Dept:  74 Defendants David Talasazan and Maya  Talasazan’s Demurrer to Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint  Plaintiff alleges defendants David Talasazan and Maya  Talasazan, among others, entered into a three-year commercial lease in July  2022. Plaintiff further alleges defendants stopped paying rent, illegally stored  marijuana on the premises, and damaged the premises. Plaintiff’s form first  amended complaint filed on August 31 sufficiently alleges against the Talasazan  defendants causes of action for breach of contract and common counts. But  plaintiff’s third cause of action for fraud lacks the required specificity of  who, what, where, when, how for a fraud cause of action. The court overrules  the demurrer to the first two causes of action and sustains the demurrer to the  third cause of action with 15 days’ leave to amend. Defendants shall give  notice.
