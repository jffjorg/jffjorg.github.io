BACKGROUND
On May 28, 2021, plaintiff
Thelidria Calhoun, in and through her successor-in-interest Dimitria Calhoun,
filed a complaint against Torrance Memorial Medical Center, Transitional Care
Unit, Kindred Hospital Southbay, and Memorial Hospital of Gardena for (1) elder
abuse, (2) negligence, (3) gross negligence, (4) corporate negligence, (5)
willful misconduct, (6) violation of Patient’s Bill of Rights, and (7) wrongful
death.
On November 14, 2022, at the FSC,
the court noted that there was no proof that defendants had been served.  The minute order reflects that there being no
appearances by or for either side, nor communication with the court as to why
there are no appearances by counsel or parties, the court ordered that the FSC
be taken off calendar/vacated.  The court
stated further that if there is no appearance at the trial scheduled for November
28, 2022, the court may dismiss the case pursuant to CCP §581(b)(3).
On November 28, 2022, on the trial
date, there were no appearances, and the court ordered the case dismissed
without prejudice.
On May 17, 2023, the case was
transferred from the PI Hub to Dept. M.
On June 30, 2023, the court granted
plaintiff’s motion to vacate and set aside the dismissal.
On September 25, 2023, plaintiff
filed a FAC for (1) elder abuse, (2) negligence, (3) willful misconduct, (4)
violation of Patient’s Bill of Rights, and (5) wrongful death.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
Demurrer
When considering demurrers, courts
read the allegations liberally and in context. 
Taylor v. City of Los Angeles
Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th 1216, 1228.  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters. 
Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the
pleading or are judicially noticed.”  SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.  “The only issue
involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”  Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.
Strike
“The court may, upon a motion . .
., or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper:  (a) Strike any irrelevant, false, or improper
matter inserted in any pleading.  (b)
Strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity
with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.”  CCP §436(b).
            CCP §431.10 states:  “(a) A material allegation in a pleading is
one essential to the claim or defense and which could not be stricken from the
pleading without leaving it insufficient as to that claim or defense.  
(b) An immaterial allegation in a
pleading is any of the following:  (1) An
allegation that is not essential to the statement of a claim or defense.  (2) An allegation that is neither pertinent
to nor supported by an otherwise sufficient claim or defense.  (3) A demand for judgment requesting relief
not supported by the allegations of the complaint or cross-complaint.  
(c) An ‘immaterial allegation’
means ‘irrelevant matter’ as that term is used in Section 436.”
The grounds for moving to strike
must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.  CCP §437.
DISCUSSION
Demurrer
Defendant Torrance Memorial Medical
Center demurs to the First, Third, and Fourth Causes of Action on the grounds that
they fail to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action and
plaintiff lacks standing.
The FAC alleges that Thelidria
Calhoun was born in 1935.  FAC, ¶17.  On December 5, 2017, Thelidria was admitted
to Torrance Memorial Medical Center due to shortness of breath and
pneumonia.  On December 8, 2017, she was
moved to ICU.  Id., ¶22.  Her condition continued to deteriorate during
her stay at Torrance Memorial to March 2018, when she was transferred to
Transitional Care Unit (“TCU”).  She was
released from TCU on October 23, 2018, even though she was not stable.  She was extremely weak and when she was taken
to her bedroom the attendants did something that hurt her neck.  She continued to decline and was readmitted
to Torrance Memorial in December 2018.  Id., ¶23. 

The FAC further alleges that on
January 27, 2019, Thelidria was transferred to Kindred for rehabilitation of
her hip and to help wean her off her ventilator.  During a cardiology consultation on February
25, 2019, it was noted that she had “a recent cervical neck fracture, multiple
orthopedic fractures, malnutrition, interstitial lung disease, acute on chronic
respiratory failure status post tracheostomy with trach collar, decubitus wound
with wound Vac.”  She required frequent
repositioning every two hours for pressure relief on the decubitus wounds she
suffered.  Id., ¶28.  On March 5, 2019, she was taken to Memorial
Hospital of Gardena after 911 was called. 
Id., ¶29.  On April 1, 2019,
Thelidria’s daughter Dimitria Calhoun demanded a meeting with the CEO of
defendant Kindred and that Thelidria be transferred to Kindred Orange, but they
refused to do so.  She informed the CEO
and other department heads that Thelidria was not being turned, that she had
severe bed sores, that she looked swollen, and that her GI tube was leaking,
but the treatment stayed the same.  By
April 30, 2019, she had developed an infection and was taken to ICU.  Id., ¶31. 
By May 12, 2019, Kindred’s nursing staff indicated that Thelidria’s
pressure ulcer had yellow slough and drainage, indicating infection.  Id., ¶32. 
On May 15, 2019, Kindred completed a wound care consult that indicated
that the two scattered Stage 4 pressure ulcers progressed to being
unstageable.  Id., ¶33.  She died on June 1, 2019 from septic shock
secondary to the large, infected, necrotic sacral decubitus ulcer.  Id., ¶45.
            Standing
Defendant argues that plaintiff
does not have standing as to the first four causes of action because she has
not filed a declaration under CCP §377.32. 
The court notes that plaintiff filed a declaration pursuant to CCP
§377.32 on March 26, 2024.
 
            First
Cause of Action for Elder Abuse
In order to state a cause of action
under the Elder Abuse Act, “a plaintiff must allege conduct essentially
equivalent to conduct that would support recovery of punitive damages.” Covenant
Care, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal. 4th 771, 789.   There must be a showing of recklessness,
fraud, malice, or oppression.  Id.
at 783.
“[T]he facts constituting the
neglect and establishing the causal link between the neglect and the injury
‘must be pleaded with particularity,’ in accordance with the pleading rules
governing statutory claims.”  Carter
v. Prime Healthcare Paradise Valley (2011) 198 Cal. App. 4th 396, 407
(citing Covenant Care). 
“Allegations of misconduct directed against one defendant . . . do not
state a cause of action against another defendant against whom the allegations
of misconduct are not directed.”  Id.
at 410 (citation omitted).  “[W]hen a
plaintiff asserts a claim against a health care provider on a legal theory
other than professional negligence, courts must determine whether the claim is
nonetheless based on the health care provider’s professional negligence.”  Larson v. UHS of Rancho Springs, Inc.
(2014) 230 Cal. App. 4th 336, 347 (citation omitted).  Citing to the content of the definition of
“neglect” in Welf. and Inst. Code §15610.57(b), the Supreme Court stated,
“[w]hat they each seem to contemplate is the existence of a robust caretaking
or custodial relationship—that is, a relationship where a certain party has
assumed a significant measure of responsibility for attending to one or more of
an elder’s basic needs that an able-bodied and fully competent adult would
ordinarily be capable of managing without assistance.”  Winn v. Pioneer Medical Group, Inc.
(2016) 63 Cal. 4th 148, 58.  “What seems
beyond doubt is that the Legislature enacted a scheme distinguishing between –
and decidedly not lumping together – claims of professional negligence and
neglect.”  Id. at 159.
The FAC alleges that upon admission
to Torrance Memorial on December 8, 2017, Thelidria’s skin was clear of any
breakdown and she did not have any preexisting pressure ulcers.  FAC, ¶26. 
A Braden Skin Risk assessment should have been done as the score would
have alerted the nursing staff, indicating that she was at risk of developing
pressure ulcers.  Between December 8 and
January 18, 2018, she was in ICU and on a ventilator.  She developed an infection in her GI
track.  She was unable to eat and on
December 30, 2017, she developed an abscess on her right side.  She was not being turned every two hours and
this caused bed sores.  By January 30,
2018, she had to have a feeding tube put in because she had not been eating.  On February 2, 2018, physical therapy was
started and she could stand with assistance.  In March 2018 she was moved to TCU.  Id., ¶27.
The FAC further alleges that in
December 2018, Thelidria was taken to Torrance Memorial where she underwent
surgery to repair her hip.  Her nurses
repeatedly failed to properly clean Thelidria. 
Her daughter regularly visited and found her mother lying in feces.  On January 27, 2019, Thelidria was
transferred to Kindred Hospital Southbay. 
Id., ¶28. 
Defendant argues that plaintiff has
not alleged egregious acts of misconduct or facts amounting to authorization or
ratification.
In opposition, plaintiff argues
that the allegations are sufficient.
The court finds that the
allegations are insufficient to meet the elements.  Plaintiff alleges two admissions at Torrance
Memorial.  The allegations do not show oppression,
fraud, or malice or a conscious disregard of the high probability of such
injury (unstageable bedsore) as to either of the admissions.  Further, the allegations are insufficient as
to ratification as they are conclusory.
The demurrer is SUSTAINED WITH
LEAVE TO AMEND.
            Third
Cause of Action for Willful Misconduct
Defendant argues that there does
not exist a cause of action for willful misconduct and no facts are alleged to
support the cause of action.
In her opposition, plaintiff
concedes the Third Cause of Action should be dismissed.
The court finds that a cause of
action for “willful misconduct” does not exist. 
See Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal. App. 4th 518, 526
(“The parties have argued extensively about whether a tort called ‘willful
misconduct’ is recognized in California. 
It is not a separate tort, but simply ‘an aggravated form of negligence,
differing in quality rather than degree from ordinary lack of care.’”)
(citation and internal quotations omitted).
The demurrer is SUSTAINED WITHOUT
LEAVE TO AMEND.
            Fourth
Cause of Action for violation of Patient’s Bill of Rights
Defendant argues that the statute
does not apply to it because it is not a skilled nursing facility; rather it is
a general “acute care facility.” 
Defendant points out that Health and Safety Code §1430(b) and CCR §72527
only apply to skilled nursing facilities or intermediate care facilities.
In her opposition, plaintiff states
that she will not object to a ruling by the court sustaining the demurrer
without leave to amend.
The court finds that Patient’s Bill
of Rights does not apply to defendant, which plaintiff concedes.
The demurrer is SUSTAINED WITHOUT
LEAVE TO AMEND as to the Fourth Cause of Action.
 
            Motion to Strike
            Defendant requests that the court
strike the claim for punitive, exemplary, and treble damages from the FAC at
paras. 78 (under First Cause of Action) and 95 (under Third Cause of Action)
and prayer at 2, 4 (under the First Cause of Action), and 8 (under Third Cause
of Action for willful misconduct).
            In light of the ruling on the
demurrer, the motion to strike is GRANTED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND as to para. 78
and prayer at 2 and 4.  The motion to
strike is GRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND as to para. 95 and prayer at 8. 
ORDER
The demurrer to the First Cause of
Action in the FAC is SUSTAINED WITH 20 DAYS LEAVE TO AMEND.  The demurrer to the Third and Fourth Causes
of Action are SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
The motion to strike is GRANTED
WITH 20 DAYS LEAVE TO AMEND as to para. 78 and prayer at 2 and 4.  The motion to strike is GRANTED WITHOUT LEAVE
TO AMEND as to para. 95 and prayer at 8.
Moving defendant is ordered to give
notice of ruling.

Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.
DISCUSSION
Defendant Kindred demurs to the Second
Cause of Action for Negligence and the Fourth Cause of Action for Violation of
Patient’s Bill of Rights on the ground that they fail to state sufficient facts
to constitute a cause of action.
The FAC alleges that Thelidria
Calhoun was born in 1935.  FAC, ¶17.  On December 5, 2017, Thelidria was admitted
to Torrance Memorial Medical Center due to shortness of breath and
pneumonia.  On December 8, 2017, she was
moved to ICU.  Id., ¶22.  Her condition continued to deteriorate during
her stay at Torrance Memorial to March 2018, when she was transferred to
Transitional Care Unit (“TCU”).  She was
released from TCU on October 23, 2018, even though she was not stable.  She was extremely weak and when she was taken
to her bedroom the attendants did something that hurt her neck.  She continued to decline and was readmitted
to Torrance Memorial in December 2018.  Id., ¶23.
As to Kindred, the FAC alleges that
on January 27, 2019, Thelidria was transferred to Kindred for rehabilitation of
her hip and to help wean her off her ventilator.  During a cardiology consultation on February
25, 2019, it was noted that she had “a recent cervical neck fracture, multiple
orthopedic fractures, malnutrition, interstitial lung disease, acute on chronic
respiratory failure status post tracheostomy with trach collar, decubitus wound
with wound Vac.”  She required frequent
repositioning every two hours for pressure relief on the decubitus wounds she
suffered.  Id., ¶28.  On March 5, 2019, she was taken to Memorial
Hospital of Gardena after 911 was called. 
Id., ¶29.
On April 1, 2019, Thelidria’s
daughter Dimitria Calhoun demanded a meeting with the CEO of defendant Kindred
and that Thelidria be transferred to Kindred Orange, but they refused to do
so.  She informed the CEO and other
department heads that Thelidria was not being turned, that she had severe bed
sores, that she looked swollen, and that her GI tube was leaking, but the
treatment stayed the same.  By April 30, 2019,
she had developed an infection and was taken to ICU.  Id., ¶31. 
By May 12, 2019, Kindred’s nursing staff indicated that Thelidria’s
pressure ulcer had yellow slough and drainage, indicating infection.  Id., ¶32. 
On May 15, 2019, Kindred completed a wound care consult that indicated
that the two scattered Stage 4 pressure ulcers progressed to being
unstageable.  Id., ¶33.  She died on June 1, 2019 from septic shock
secondary to the large, infected, necrotic sacral decubitus ulcer.  Id., ¶23, 45.
 
            Second
Cause of Action for Negligence
Defendant argues that the cause of
action is barred by the one year statute of limitations under CCP §340.5 (“In
an action for injury or death against a health care provider based upon such
person’s alleged professional negligence . . . .”).  Defendant asserts that it is a healthcare
provider, and that the allegations against it relate to professional
negligence.  Defendant contends that the
complaint was not filed until May 28, 2021, almost two years after decedent
died on June 1, 2019.
A review of the factual allegations
is that Kindred was operating as a skilled nursing facility.  (FAC ¶ 15.) 
On January 27, 2019 Mrs. Calhoun was transferred to Kindred for
rehabilitation of her hip and to help wean her off her ventilator.  (FAC ¶ 28.) 
Plaintiff complains that Kindred failed to properly reposition Mrs.
Calhoun frequently enough .  (FAC ¶ 28,
29, 42.)  In short, the conduct that is
alleged to have been provided by Kindred was that of medical care.
In opposition, plaintiff argues
that the cause of action is not barred by the applicable statute of
limitations, which is two-years under CCP §335.1.  Plaintiff contends that this cause of action
is for general negligence, not medical malpractice.
“The FAC is pled with sufficient
facts to constitute a cause of action for general negligence. Defendant
Kindred’s demurrer mistakenly asserts that Plaintiffs’ negligence claim (the
second cause of action), is for medical malpractice.  This is incorrect.  Plaintiffs’ negligence claim is for general
negligence, an additional theory of liability.” 
(Opposition pg. 3:2-5.)
Other than making this naked assertion,
Plaintiff directs to the Court to nothing that appears to be “general
negligence” rather than the provision of medical care.
The court finds that the cause of
action alleges medical care as the factual basis for the claim of negligence
and therefore it is governed by the statute of limitations governing medical
malpractice, not general negligence.  The
claim is time barred on its face.
The demurrer is SUSTAINED WITH 20
DAYS LEAVE TO AMEND the Second Cause of Action.
            Fourth
Cause of Action For Violation of Patient’s Bill of Rights
Defendant argues that the statute
does not apply to it because it is not a skilled nursing facility; rather it is
a general “acute care facility.” 
Defendant points out that Health and Safety Code §1430(b) and CCR §72527
only apply to skilled nursing facilities or intermediate care facilities.
“Plaintiffs hereby concede that the
Fourth Cause of Action does not apply to Defendant Kindred, and they will not
object to a ruling by the Court sustaining the Demurrer to the Fourth Cause of
Action without leave to amend.” 
(Opposition pg. 2:3-6.)
The court finds that Patient’s Bill
of Rights does not apply to defendant.
The demurrer is SUSTAINED WITHOUT
LEAVE TO AMEND as to the Fourth Cause of Action.
 
ORDER
The demurrer to the Second Cause of
Action in the FAC is SUSTAINED WITH 20 DAYS LEAVE TO AMENED.  The demurrer to the Fourth Cause of Action is
SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
Moving defendant is ordered to give
notice of ruling.
