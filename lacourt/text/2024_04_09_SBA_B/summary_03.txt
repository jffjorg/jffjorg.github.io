The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel responses to the plaintiff's request for production of documents. The plaintiff failed to timely respond to the discovery requests, which waived all objections, including privilege and work product. The court orders the plaintiff to serve a verified response without objections to the defendant's request for production of documents and to produce all responsive documents within 15 days. Additionally, the court imposes a monetary sanction of $1,190 on the plaintiff for the misuse of the discovery process.
