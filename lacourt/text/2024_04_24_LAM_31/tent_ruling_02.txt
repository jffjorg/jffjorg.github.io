MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
MOVING PARTY:               Marvin
B. Adviento, MBA Legal, P.C.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
On January 23, 2024, Marvin B. Adviento, counsel for Plaintiff,
Elena Svistina, filed this Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.  
 
The motion was calendared for hearing on February 21,
2024.  Because the motion was not
supported by proof of service or a completed proposed order (Form MC-053), the
court continued the motion to March 27, 2024. 

 
On March 4, 2024, Counsel filed an amended Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel.  At the hearing on
March 27, 2024, the court continued the motion a second time because the
amended Motion did not address any of the issues raised in the court’s previous
order.  The motion was continued to April
24, 2024. Counsel was directed to file a proof of service showing this motion
was served on all parties in this action and to submit a proposed order (Form
MC-053) which addressed Items 3, 5, 7, and 9. 

 
On April 18, 2024, Counsel filed a declaration.  The amended Motion and proposed order is attached
to the declaration.  In the declaration,
Counsel explains the following:
 
“As for the Motion itself with the new date of April 24,
2024, my first attempt to file it was rejected on April 8, 2024 because the
original reservation number on the Motion was for the initial hearing date of
February 21, 2024.”  (Adviento Decl., ¶ 5.)  “This was surprising because after the
February 21, 2024 hearing was continued, I re-filed the Motion with the
continued March 27, 2024 hearing date with the same reservation number, and it
was accepted.”  (Id. at ¶ 6.)  “Thereupon, on April 18, 2024, I re-filed the
Motion with the April 24, 2024 hearing date without the reservation number.”  (Id. at ¶ 7.)  
 
The Motion is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to
the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without
compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the
Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration
on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order
relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
III.       DISCUSSION 
 
Marvin B. Adviento seeks to be relieved as counsel of record
for Plaintiff for the following reasons: “There is an irreparable breakdown in
the attorney-client relationship.”  (Form
MC-052.)   
 
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s
request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 406.)  
 
Upon review, the court finds the amended motion now complies
with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. 
Counsel has cured the defects noted in the court’s previous orders.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION         
            Accordingly,
the unopposed Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED and effective
upon the filing of the proof of service of this signed order on Plaintiff.
            Counsel to
give notice.  
Dated:   April 24, 2024
