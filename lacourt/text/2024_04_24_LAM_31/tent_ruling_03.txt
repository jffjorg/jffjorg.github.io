MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL



 
MOVING PARTY:               R.
David DiJulio, DiJulio Law Group
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION
 
On February 28, 2024, R. David DiJulio, counsel for Plaintiff,
Karen Garush Berkibekyan, filed this Motion to be Relieved as Counsel.  
 
The Motion is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to be directed to
the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without
compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1) (made on the
Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil
form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration
on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order
relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
 
The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw,
and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no prejudice to the
client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.  (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
III.       DISCUSSION 
 
R. David DiJulio seeks to be relieved as counsel of record
for Plaintiff for the following reasons: “Client has failed to communicate with
me and has failed to meet his obligations to my firm.”  (Form MC-052.) 
 
 
Absent a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s
request for withdrawal should be granted.  (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398, 406.)  
 
Upon review, the court finds that the Motion does not comply
with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. 
Counsel has not submitted a completed proposed order.  Counsel must address Items 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION         
            Accordingly,
the Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel is CONTINUED to May 17, 2024 at
8:30 a.m. to allow Counsel to file a proposed order consistent with this
order.  Counsel is to file the amended
proposed order no later than 5 court days before the hearing.
            The Status
Conference re: Representation of Plaintiff and Trial Setting Conference are
CONTINUED to May 17, 2024.
            Counsel to
give notice.  
Dated:   April 24, 2024
