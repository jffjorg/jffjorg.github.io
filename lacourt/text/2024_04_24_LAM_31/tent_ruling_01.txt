CASE:                                State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Company v.
Ahmad Martin, et al.
 
CASE NO.:                 20STCV44367
 





















 
MOTION
TO VACATE THE DISMISSAL AND MOTION TO ENFORCE A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND ENTER
JUDGMENT



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
            On November 19, 2020, Plaintiff, State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company, filed a Complaint against Defendants, Ahmad
Martin (“Martin”) and John Ruffin (“Ruffin”) for subrogation recovery in the
sum of $26,155.80.
 
            On April 5,
2021, Ruffin was dismissed from this action.
 
            On June 14,
2023, Plaintiff filed the parties’ Stipulation for Settlement and Entry of
Judgment (“Stipulation”).  On the same
day, the court dismissed the case without prejudice and retained jurisdiction
to enforce the terms of the settlement and enter judgment in the event of
default. 
 
            On February
13, 2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion to Vacate the Dismissal and Motion to
Enforce a Settlement Agreement and Enter Judgment against Martin.  Plaintiff sought entry of judgment in the
amount of $16,220.01, consisting of $26,155.80 in damages, $2,720,43 in
prejudgment interest, $1,174.67 in attorney fees, $593.22 in costs, and less
$14,424.02 paid by Martin’s insurance carrier.
 
            The motion
was heard on April 10, 2024.  The court issued
an order finding that Plaintiff substantiated the damages sought, properly
calculated the interest, and supported the costs requested with a memorandum of
costs.  However, the court found that the
Stipulation required each party to bear their own attorney fees.  The court was therefore inclined to enter
judgment in the sum of $15,045.34, which was the judgment requested less
attorney fees of $1,174.67.  The court
continued the motion to allow Plaintiff to file an amended proposed judgment.
 
            On April
10, 2024, Plaintiff filed an amended proposed order and an amended proposed
judgment requesting a total judgment of $15,045.34 against Martin. 
 
The court finds that the amended proposed judgment is
consistent with the court’s previous order. 
Accordingly, the unopposed Motion to Vacate the Dismissal and Motion to
Enforce a Settlement Agreement and Enter Judgment is GRANTED.  Judgment is entered in favor of Plaintiff State
Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company and against Defendant Ahmad Martin in
the total sum of $15,045.34.
