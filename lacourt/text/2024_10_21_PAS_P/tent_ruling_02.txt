 Case Number:  23AHCV00295    Hearing Date:   October 21, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER CONTINUING THE DEFAULT PROVE-UP HEARINGI.        INTRODUCTION
          This is an action arising from the non-payment of a money judgment
in the Superior Court of the County of San Francisco, Case No. CGC-03-416572.
On February 9, 2023, Plaintiff Suae-Chen Chang (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint
against Defendants Richard Kok Wai Chang aka Richard C. Chang (“Chang”), Ping
Li (“Li”), and Does 1 through 10, inclusive (collectively, “Defendants”)
alleging causes of action for: (1) declaratory relief; and (2) foreclosure of
lien.  
          Defendant Li was served with the summons and complaint on
March 26, 2023 by substituted service. 
          Defendant Chang was served with the summons and complaint
on March 27, 2023 by personal service.  
          On November 9, 2023, respective defaults were entered
against Defendants Li and Chang. 
          On March 27, 2024, this action was reassigned from the
Honorable Margaret L. Oldendorf to the Honorable Jared D. Moses sitting in
Department P at Pasadena Courthouse effective April 2, 2024. 
          On April 3, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s ex parte
application to continue prove up hearing. (04/03/24 Minute Order.) The
Court continued the hearing from April 15, 2024, to June 24, 2024. (04/03/24
Minute Order.) Plaintiff was “directed to bring a proposed Judgement and all
supporting documents to the next hearing.” (04/03/24 Minute Order.) 
          On June 10, 2024, the Court, on its own motion, continued
the default prove up hearing from June 24, 2024 to July 23, 2024.   
          On July 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed a prove-up hearing brief.

          On July 23, 2024, the Court continued the default prove up
hearing to October 21, 2024 due to a county wide network outage. (07/23/24
Minute Order.)  
 
II.      LEGAL
STANDARD       
A party seeking default
judgment must comply with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800. In
support of a default judgment application, a party must file the following: (1)
a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a declaration of nonmilitary
status for each defendant against whom judgment is sought; (6) a proposed form
of judgment; (7) dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought;
(8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorney fees if allowed by
statute or by agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1800(a)(1)-(9).)  
 
III.     ANALYSIS
          Plaintiff has not filed a default
judgment application. Plaintiff has not filed: (1) a signed memorandum of costs
and disbursements; (2) a declaration of non-military status; (3) a request for
court judgment form on CIV-100; (4) a proposed form of judgment; (5) a
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; (6) interest computations; (7) properly authenticated exhibits; or (8)
a summary of the case. Plaintiff has also not dismissed any of the Doe
defendants. The Court cannot grant default judgment until Plaintiff files a
sufficient default judgment application. Plaintiff has not satisfied the
requirements of Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800. A default prove-up brief is
not a default judgment application. 
 
IV.     
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 Based on the foregoing, the Court CONTINUES
the default-prove up hearing to Friday, December 13, 2024, at 8:30 AM in this
department. Plaintiff is to file a complete default judgment application at
least five court days prior to the continued hearing date.  
          
          Plaintiff Suae-Chen Chang to give notice of this order.
