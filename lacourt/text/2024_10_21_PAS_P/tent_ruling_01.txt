ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT MARIA RAQUENEL PORTILLO JIMENEZ’S MOTION FOR
RECONSIDERATIONI.        INTRODUCTION
          This is a personal injury
action arising from the alleged childhood sexual abuse, sexual battery,
assault, and molestation that Plaintiffs Jane Doe K.C. 1 and Jane Doe A.H. 2 (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) suffered at the hands of Defendants Gloria De Los Angeles Trevino
Ruiz aka Gloria Trevi (“Trevi”), an individual; Sergio Gustavo Andrade Sanchez
aka Sergio Andrade (“Andrade”), an individual; Maria Raquenel Portillo Jimenez
aka Mary Boquitas and Mary Raquenel (“Boquitas”), an individual; and DOES 4
through 50 (collectively, “Defendants”). Plaintiffs filed the operative First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants on March 16, 2023, alleging causes
of action for (1) Sexual Battery – Civil Code § 1708.5 (Plf. Jane Doe K.C. 1);
(2) Sexual Assault (Plf. Jane Doe K.C. 1); (3) Violation of Penal Code §
647.6(a)(1) – Annoying and Molesting a Minor (Plf. Jane Doe K.C. 1); (4) Sexual
Battery – Civil Code § 1708.5 (Plf. Jane Doe A.H. 2); (5) Sexual Assault (Plf.
Jane Doe A.H. 2); and (6) Violation of Penal Code § 647.6(a)(1) – Annoying and
Molesting a Minor (Plf. Jane Doe A.H. 2). 
          
          Plaintiffs allege at the age of
fifteen (15) and thirteen (13), Jane Doe K.C. 1 and Jane Doe A.H. 2,
respectively were groomed, manipulated, exploited, and coerced to engage in
sexual contact with Defendants Trevi and Andrade, who are a well-known Mexican
pop star and a famous music producer, while touring in California. (FAC ¶2.)
Plaintiff Jane Doe K.C. 1 worked as a background dancer for Defendant Trevi
beginning in or about November 1991. (Id. at ¶28.) From 1992 until 2000,
Defendants Trevi and Andrade coerced Plaintiff Jane Dor K.C.1 to have sexual
intercourse with Defendant Andrade and other sexual acts with other girls. (Id.
at ¶¶40-53.) In or 1989, Defendant Andrade began sexually assaulting Plaintiff
Jane Doe A.H. 2. (Id. at ¶¶126-130.)
 
          On September 1, 2023, Defendant
Jimenez filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint (“FACC”) against Defendant
Andrade, Plaintiffs, ROE J.P. 1, ROE J.P. 2, ROE S.P. 3, ROE J.C.4, ROE S 5,
and ROES 6 through 50, inclusive, alleging causes of action for (1) Indemnity;
(2) Contribution; (3) Defamation – Libel and Libel Per Se; (4) False
Light; and (5) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress. The FACC alleges
the allegations made in the FAC about her are false and libelous. (FACC
¶¶98-99.)
 
          On November 16, 2023,
Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants Jane Doe K.C. 1 and A.H. 2 filed a Special Motion
to Strike (Anti-SLAPP) as to the FACC. The motion was fully briefed and came
for hearing on December 22, 2023. The Court granted the motion and dismissed
with prejudice as to Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants.
 
          On December 27, 2023, Defendant Trevi
filed an Answer to the FAC and Cross-Complaint against Defendant Andrade,
Plaintiffs, Jane ROE J.P. 1, Conexiones Americanas, S.A. de C.V., and DOES 1
through 100, inclusive, alleging causes of action for: (1) Sexual Assault; (2)
Aiding and Abetting Sexual Assault; (3) Sexual Battery; (4) Aiding and Abetting
Sexual Battery; (5) Battery; (6) Aiding and Abetting Battery; (7) Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress; (8) Negligent Infliction of Emotional
Distress; and (9) Indemnity. 
 
          On January 12, 2024, the Court found
that the Case No. 23GDCV02700 is related to this case and designated this case
as the lead. 
 
          On January 30, 2024,
Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants filed a Demurrer to the Cross-Complaint. The matter
was fully briefed and came for hearing on May 1, 2024. The Court overruled the
demurrer. On May 13, 2024, Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants filed an Answer to the
Cross-Complaint. 
 
          On April 15, 2024,
Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants filed a Motion for Attorney Fees pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure Section 425.16(c). The matter was fully briefed and came for
hearing on July 11, 2024. The Court granted the motion and ordered Defendant Jimenez
to pay $37,408.37 in attorney fees to Plaintiffs/Cross-defendant within 30 days
of the order. 
 
          On July 23, 2024, Defendant Jimenez
filed the instant Motion for Reconsideration. On October 8, 2024,
Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants filed an Opposition. On October 10, 2024, Defendant
Jimenez filed a Reply. 
          
II.      LEGAL
STANDARD
          Code of Civil Procedure Section 1008, subdivision (a)
provides in pertinent part, “[w]hen an application for an order has been made
to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or
granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within
10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order
and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application
to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and
modify, amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application
shall state by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what
judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts,
circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008, subd.
(a).) 
 
As
it relates to new or different facts, circumstances, or law under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a), “the moving party must provide a
satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce that evidence at an earlier
time.” (Shiffer v. CBS Corp. (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 246, 255.)
Furthermore, “facts of which the party seeking reconsideration was aware at the
time of the original ruling are not “new or different.” (In re Marriage of
Herr (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1468.) 
 
III.     ANALYSIS
          Defendant Jimenez moves for this Court to reconsider and
revoke its July 11, 2024, in which Plaintiffs’ Motion for Attorney’s Fees and
Costs Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 425.16, subdivision (c) was
granted in the amount of $37,408.37.
The motion is made on the grounds that Plaintiffs’ failed to serve and file
their fees/costs motion within the 60 days after Notice of Entry of the Order
granting the anti-SLAPP motion per California Rules of Court, rule 3.1702,
subdivision (b). Defendant Jimenez contends she did not discover this rule
until after July 11, 2024. 
          
          In opposition, Plaintiffs argue
Defendant Jimenez improperly asserts an alternative legal argument without
establishing either new or different law or meeting the diligence requirement
applicable to motions for reconsideration under Section 1008, subdivision (a).
Moreover, Plaintiffs contend this present motion is untimely because it was
filed eleven days after service of the notice of entry of the July 11, 2024
order. Plaintiffs also contend their fees/costs motion was not untimely under
rule 3.1702 because the first and second causes of action of the Cross-Complaint
are still pending against the other Cross-Defendants. 
 
As a preliminary matter, the Court notes that the
instant motion is untimely. A motion for reconsideration of the July 11, 2024
order was supposed to be filed by July 22, 2024 because the tenth day fell on
July 21, 2024, which is a Sunday. Even if the motion was timely, it would still
fail for the substantive reasons set forth below. 
 
In Baldwin v. Home Sav. of America (1997) 59
Cal.App.4th 1192, the court held “the diligence requirement applicable to
motions to reconsider on the basis of different facts is also applicable to
motions to reconsider on the basis of different law.” (Baldwin v. Home Sav.
of America (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1192, 1200.) Here, Defendant Jimenez does
not provide a satisfactory explanation as to why the argument regarding the
timeliness of Plaintiffs’ fees/costs motion under rule 3.1702, subdivision (b)
was not presented earlier such as in her original opposition. Defendant Jimenez
merely asserts the timing requirements of rule 3.1702 were not apparent at the
time of the original hearing. 
 
Next, Plaintiffs’ fees/costs motion was timely
pursuant to rule 3.1702, which states, “A notice of motion to claim attorney’s
fees for services up to and including the rendition of judgment in the trial
court--including attorney’s fees on an appeal before the rendition of judgment
in the trial court--must be served and filed within the time for filing a
notice of appeal under rules 8.104 and 8.108 in an unlimited civil case or
under rules 8.822 and 8.823 in a limited civil case.” (CRC, Rule 3.1702, subd. (b).)
Furthermore, California Rules of Court, rule 8.104, subdivision (a)(1) states:
“Unless a statute or rules 8.108, 8.702, or 8.712 provide otherwise, a notice
of appeal must be filed on or before the earliest of: (A) 60 days after the
superior court clerk serves on the party filing the notice of appeal a document
entitled “Notice of Entry” of judgment or a filed-endorsed copy of the
judgment, showing the date either was served; (B) 60 days after the party
filing the notice of appeal serves or is served by a party with a document
entitled “Notice of Entry” of judgment or a filed-endorsed copy of the
judgment, accompanied by proof of service; or (C) 180 days after entry of
judgment.” (CRC, Rule 8.104, subd. (a)(1).)
 
Neither party disputes that Plaintiffs’ fees/costs
motion concerned fees incurred in connection to their special motion to strike
(anti-SLAPP motion). The July 11, 2024 order granted Plaintiff’s fees/costs
motion. “A motion for attorney fees incurred in connection with a prejudgment
appealable order, such as an order granting or denying a special motion to
strike, is a “claim for services” rendered before “the rendition of judgment.”
It is not a claim “for services up to and including the rendition of judgment,”
and therefore does not fit within the plain language of rule 3.1702.” (Carpenter
v. Jack in the Box Corp. (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 454, 464.) 
 
As such, “the
time limits imposed by rules 3.1702 and 8.104 for filing a motion for attorney
fees under section 425.16, subdivision (c) do not commence to run until entry
of judgment at the conclusion of the litigation. This interpretation of rule
3.1702 is consistent not only with the rule's history and underlying policy,
but also with existing law and practice.” (Id. at 468.) The Cross-Complaint which was the subject of the
special motion to strike is still pending as to the first and second causes of
action, thus there has been no rendition of judgment or conclusion of
litigation. Defendant Jimenez does not cite to any published case law or
statutory authority indicating otherwise.
