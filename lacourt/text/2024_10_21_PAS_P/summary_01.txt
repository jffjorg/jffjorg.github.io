And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Maria Raquenel Portillo Jimenez's motion for reconsideration of the court's previous order granting Plaintiffs Jane Doe K.C. 1 and Jane Doe A.H. 2 attorney fees. The defendant argued that the plaintiffs' fees/costs motion was untimely because it was filed more than 60 days after the notice of entry of the anti-SLAPP motion, which was granted on December 22, 2023. The court found that the defendant did not provide a satisfactory explanation for why this argument was not presented earlier and that the plaintiffs' fees/costs motion was timely because it was filed before the rendition of judgment. The court also held that the time limits for filing a motion for attorney fees under Code of Civil Procedure Section 425.16 do not commence to run until entry of judgment at the conclusion of the litigation, which has not yet occurred.
