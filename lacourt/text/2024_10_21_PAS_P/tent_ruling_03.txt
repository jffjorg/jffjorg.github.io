 Case Number:  23AHCV02226    Hearing Date:   October 21, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER GRANTING IN PART PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL DEPOSITION ATTENDANCE OF A
PERSON MOST QUALIFIED AND CUSTODIAN OF RECORDS OF DEFENDANT AMERICAN HONDA
MOTOR CO., INC., AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONSI.        INTRODUCTION
          On October 9, 2018, Plaintiff Jose Garcia Ruiz
(“Plaintiff”) purchased a new 2019 Honda Pilot (the “Vehicle”), which was
subject to a warranty by Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. (“Defendant”).

On September
26, 2023, Plaintiff initiated this lawsuit by filing a complaint alleging
causes of action for: (1) violation of Song-Beverly Act—breach of express
warranty; and (2) fraudulent concealment.
On
October 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”)
alleging causes of action for: (1) violation of Song-Beverly Act—breach of express
warranty; and (2) fraudulent inducement—concealment. Plaintiff alleges that the
Vehicle suffered from a transmission defect, which caused the Vehicle to
“judder” and caused the Subject Vehicle to display issues with acceleration. (FAC,
¶ 13.)  
          On March 27, 2024, this action was reassigned from the
Honorable Margaret L. Oldendorf to the Honorable Jared D. Moses sitting in
Department P at Pasadena Courthouse effective April 2, 2024.   
          On July 10, 2024, after hearing oral argument, the Court
overruled Defendant’s demurrer to the FAC and denied Defendant’s motion to
strike. (07/10/24 Minute Order.) 
          Also, on July 10, 2024, Defendant filed its answer to the
complaint. 
          On September 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel
Defendant to produce a Person(s) Most Qualified (PMQ) and Custodian of Records
for deposition and for the production of documents at deposition. Plaintiff
also seeks monetary sanctions against Defendant and its counsel of record in
the sum of $3,120.00. 
          On October 7, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition to the
motion, to which Plaintiff replied on October 14, 2024. 
 
II.      LEGAL
STANDARD       
In California, discovery
statutes “must be construed liberally in favor of disclosure unless the request
is clearly improper.” (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531,
541.) “Under the discovery statutes, information is discoverable if it is
unprivileged and is either relevant to the subject matter of the action or
reasonably calculated to reveal admissible evidence.” (John B. v. Superior
Court (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1177, 1186.) “Discovery may relate to the claim or
defense of the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action.” (Ibid.)
“When discovery requests are grossly overbroad on their face, and hence do not
appear reasonably related to a legitimate discovery need, a reasonable
inference can be drawn of an intent to harass and improperly burden.” (Obregon
v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.) 
“The service of a
deposition notice under Section 2025.240 is effective to require any deponent
who is a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party to attend and to testify, as well as produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and
copying.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.280, subd. (a).)  
“If, after service of a
deposition notice, a party to the action . . . without having served a valid
objection . . . fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to
produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move
for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (a).)   
A motion made pursuant to
Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450 must “set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2025.450, subd. (b)(1).) A court may limit the frequency or extent of
discovery of electronically stored information if “[t]he likely burden or
expense of the proposed discovery outweighs the likely benefit, taking into
account the amount in controversy, the resources of the parties, the importance
of the issues in the litigation, and the importance of the requested discovery
in resolving the issues.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (f)(4).) “In law
and motion practice, factual evidence is supplied to the court by way of
declarations.” (Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53
Cal.App.4th 216, 224.) 
 
III.     ANALYSIS
          
A.   Defects in
the Notice of Motion 

Defendant contends that
the notice of motion does not indicate that Plaintiff seeks 
the production of documents at deposition.
Plaintiff argues that the notice of motion is not deficient. 
          “A
notice of motion must state in the opening paragraph the nature of the order
being sought and the grounds for issuance of the order.” (Cal. R. Ct., rule
3.1110(a).) “[D]ue process requires a party to be fully advised of the issues
to be addressed and be given adequate notice of what facts it must rebut in
order to prevail.” (Fenn v. Sherriff (2003)
109 Cal.App.4th 1466, 1481.) 
          Plaintiff’s
counsel, Timothy Lupinek (“Lupinek”), states that on May 2, 2024, Plaintiff
served Defendant with an Amended Notice of Deposition of Defendant’s PMQ and
Custodian of Records (the “Deposition Notice”). (Lupinek Decl., ¶ 3; Ex. A.)
The Deposition Notice identified 53 matters for examination and 53 requests for
document production.[1]
(Lupinek Decl., ¶ 3; Ex. A.) Defendant objected to the Deposition Notice and
indicated that it would not produce a witness on the July 8, 2024, noticed
deposition date. (Lupinek Decl., ¶ 5; Ex. C.) Defendant did not appear at the
July 8, 2024, deposition. (Lupinek Decl., ¶ 8.) 
          Plaintiff
is seeking to compel the testimony of Defendant’s PMQ and Custodian of Records,
as well as the production of documents at deposition. (See Memo. of Ps and As
at p. 8:12-14; see also Separate Statement at pp. 64-135.) However, the notice
of motion only indicates that Plaintiff is seeking to compel Defendant to
produce a PMQ and Custodian of Records at deposition. (Not. of Mot. at p.
1:5-7.) The notice of motion does not set forth that Plaintiff is seeking to
also compel the production of documents at deposition. (Not. of Mot. at p. 1.)
The Court finds that the notice of motion is deficient as it concerns
Plaintiff’s request to compel the production of documents at deposition.
Plaintiff should have specifically indicated that it sought to compel
production of documents at deposition in the notice of motion. 
          Even
if Plaintiff had requested to compel the production of documents in a
procedurally compliant manner, such request would have been denied as the
declaration of Mr. Lupinek is void of any facts showing good cause to compel
the production of documents at deposition. 
          The
Court therefore DENIES Plaintiff’s request to compel the production of
documents at deposition pursuant to the Deposition Notice.
 
B.          Plaintiff Has Shown that Defendant Did Not Appear
for Examination 
In its second and final
argument in opposition to the motion, Defendant contends 
that Plaintiff’s motion is improperly brought under
CCP § 2025.450 because Defendant did not fail to appear for examination. (Opp’n
at p. 3:4-20.) 
          The
Court rejects Defendant’s argument and finds that the motion is properly brought
under CCP § 2025.450. Mr. Lupinek has provided a declaration attesting that
Defendant did not appear at the July 8, 2024, deposition. Further, CCP §
2025.450 does not require a declaration from Plaintiff’s counsel as to the
taking of a non-appearance as Defendant contends in the opposition brief.
(Opp’n at p. 3:10-14.) Plaintiff’s counsel inquired about Defendant’s non-appearance
at the deposition. (Lupinek Decl., ¶ 8; Ex. B.) Plaintiff has therefore met the
requirements of CCP § 2025.450(b)(2) and the meet and confer requirement has
been satisfied. 
          The
Court will now address whether Defendant’s PMQ and Custodian of Records should
be deposed on the matters for examination set forth in the Deposition Notice. 
 
C.         The Matters for Examination in the Deposition
Notice are Relevant  

Plaintiff seeks to
examine Defendant’s PMQ and Custodian of Records on 53
categories. Categories No. 1-27 seek information
related to the torque converter lock-up clutch defect in the Vehicle. (Lupinek
Decl., Ex. A at pp. 5:4-7:21.) Categories No. 28 and 29 seek information as to
Defendant’s efforts to preserve discoverable information and efforts to search
for documents and information responsive to Plaintiff’s discovery requests in
this matter. (Lupinek Decl., Ex. A at p. 7:22-28.) Categories No. 30-38 seek
information pertaining to the Vehicle such as warranty claims, repairs, and
requests for repurchase. (Lupinek Decl., Ex. A at p. 8:1-14.) Category No. 39
seeks all documents produced by Defendant thus far in this litigation. (Lupinek
Decl., Ex. A at p. 8:15.) Categories No. 40-50 seek information as to
Defendant’s policies and procedures concerning matters such as repair attempts,
vehicle replacement eligibility, and training for evaluating a vehicle
repurchase. (Lupinek Decl., Ex. A at p. 8:16-9:12.) Categories No. 51, 52, and
53 seek information about databases for vehicle warranty data, methodology for
categorizing and tracking such data, and the searchability of such databases.
(Lupinek Decl., Ex. A at p. 9:13-17.) 
          The
Court finds that the matters for examination seek relevant information as such
information might assist Plaintiff in evaluating his case, preparing for trial,
or facilitating settlement. (Gonzalez v. Superior Court (1995)
33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546 (“information is relevant if it might reasonably
assist a party in evaluating the
case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement . . . .”).) The matters on which
the PMQ and Custodian of Records are to be deposed go to Plaintiff’s claims in
this action. Although it objected to the Deposition Notice, Defendant has not
justified any of its objections. (Fairmont Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.) 
          The
Court therefore finds that Defendant should be compelled to produce a PMQ and
Custodian of Records to testify at deposition on the matters for examination, nos.
1-53, listed in the Deposition Notice. 
 
D.         Monetary Sanctions 

“If a motion under
subdivision (a) is granted, the court shall impose a monetary
sanction . . . in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
          Mr.
Lupinek declares that he spent a total of seven (7) hours in connection with
the instant motion at the rate of $450.00 per hour. (Lupinek Decl., ¶ 10.) A
$60.00 filing fee was incurred for the motion. (Lupinek Decl., ¶ 10.) Plaintiff
therefore requests monetary sanctions of $3,120.00 against Defendant and its
counsel of record, Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough LLP. (Lupinek Decl.,
¶ 10.) 
          The
Court finds that monetary sanctions are appropriate. Defendant did not produce
its PMQ and Custodian of Records for deposition. The Court GRANTS IN PART
Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions and AWARDS Plaintiff reasonable
monetary sanctions in the amount of $960.00 (representing two (2) hours of work
on the motion at the rate of $450 per hour plus the $60 filing fee). The Court
reduces the hours given the straightforward nature of the motion and the lack
of complexity. Monetary sanctions are to be paid by Defendant to Plaintiff as
CCP § 2025.450(g)(1) does not authorize the imposition of monetary sanctions
against Defendant’s counsel. 
 
IV.     
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s Motion to
Compel Deposition Attendance of a Person Most Qualified and Custodian of
Records of Defendant, and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. 
The
Court DENIES Plaintiff’s request to compel the production of documents at
deposition. 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request to compel Defendant’s PMQ and Custodian of
Records to be deposed on matters for examination, nos. 1-53, set forth in the Deposition
Notice. The Court ORDERS that the deposition of Defendant’s PMQ and Custodian
of Records occur within 45 days of the date of notice of this order. 
Plaintiff’s
request for monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART. Defendant is ORDERED to pay
monetary sanctions to Plaintiff in the amount of $960.00 within 30 days of the
date of notice of this order. 
          Plaintiff Jose Garcia Ruiz to give notice of this order.
