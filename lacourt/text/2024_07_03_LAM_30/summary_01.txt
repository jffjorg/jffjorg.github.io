And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has reviewed the Defendant's demurrer to the second, third, and fifth causes of action in the First Amended Complaint (FAC) and the motion to strike the claim for punitive damages. The Court has determined that the FAC sufficiently pleads facts to state causes of action for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Court has also overruled the demurrer as to these causes of action because the FAC alleges that the Defendant acted with intent to harm or offend the Plaintiff. The Court has denied the motion to strike punitive damages because the FAC alleges that the Defendant's conduct was despicable and carried on with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights or safety of others. The Defendant is ordered to answer within 10 days of the date of this ruling.
