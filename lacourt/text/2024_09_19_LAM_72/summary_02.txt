And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion to seal certain portions of the Complaint filed by ATOS IT Outsourcing Services, LLC (Plaintiff) against Disney Worldwide Services, Inc. (Defendant). The Complaint contains confidential information about the Framework Agreement between the parties, which is protected by a confidentiality provision. The court finds that this provision gives rise to an overriding interest that supports sealing the record. The court also finds that failure to seal the confidential portions of the Complaint would create a substantial probability that Plaintiff's interest will be prejudiced. The court has ordered that the redacted Complaint be sealed, and the unredacted Complaint will be filed under seal.
