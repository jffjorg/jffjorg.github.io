**Significant Statements**
```
"The Court disagrees with this argument. Mashhood still has Stage 4 cancer, which still creates a substantial doubt about his survival for six months going forward. The fact that he has not yet passed away does not diminish this risk."
"The Court will discuss these scheduling issues with the parties at the hearing. The Court encourages the parties to speak with one another about the trial date prior to the hearing."
"The day 120 days from September 19, the hearing date for this motion, is Friday, January 17, 2025. That is the latest date that trial could be set if trial preference is granted – the Court would not have discretion to set a later date."
