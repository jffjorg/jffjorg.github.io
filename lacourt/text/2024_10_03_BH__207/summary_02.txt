```
Case Number: 21SMCV01618
Hearing Date: October 3, 2024
Dept: 207
Motions:
  - Motion to Quash Service of Summons
Moving Parties:
  - Defendant Gary Ge
Opposing Party:
  - Plaintiff PacTec Holdings, LLC
Background:
  * The case arises from a business dispute between Plaintiff and Individual Defendants James Zhu and Gary Ge
  * Plaintiff alleges that Ge and Zhu, while employed by Plaintiff, competed with Plaintiff and stole business opportunities from Plaintiff, in violation of their employment agreements and fiduciary and ethical obligations to Plaintiff

Key Facts:
  * Ge is a citizen of the People's Republic of China who at all relevant times has resided and worked within the PRC
  * Ge never worked for a company that was incorporated in the United States, including in California
  * Ge has never owned any assets or property located in California nor has he ever worked for PacTec Holdings, LLC or OemTec, LLC
  * Ge's employment contract with PacTec Shanghai contains a provision requiring disputes regarding his performance of the contract be resolved through mediation, arbitration, and litigation in Shanghai

Legal Standards:
  * For service on persons within California, generally, service of the summons and complaint must be done by personal service
  * If a copy of the summons and complaint cannot with reasonable diligence be personally delivered to the person to be served, it may be served by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the person's dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address with a competent member of the household or person apparently in charge of the office, place of business, or usual mailing address
  * A summons may be served on a business organization, form unknown, by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint during usual office hours with the person who is apparently in charge of the office of that business organization, and by thereafter mailing a copy of the summons and complaint by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the person to be served at the place where a copy of the summons and complaint was left
  * Personal jurisdiction may be either general or specific

Analysis:
  * The Court finds that Ge's employment contract with PacTec Shanghai requires disputes regarding his performance of the contract be resolved through mediation, arbitration, and litigation in Shanghai
  * Plaintiff must address and overcome the issues previously identified by the Court, including Ge's employment contract and the fact that Ge has never worked for a company that was incorporated in the United States, including in California
  * The Court finds that Plaintiff has provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Ge had sufficient minimum contacts with California to establish personal jurisdiction over Ge
  * The Court grants Plaintiff's motion to quash service of the summons on the grounds that the service by publication was deficient, but denies Ge's motion to quash service of the summons on the grounds that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over Ge
