And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Michael E. Whitaker, has denied the plaintiff's motion for monetary sanctions and to compel the depositions of Matthew Negrin and Amy Gershoony. The motion was filed by the plaintiff, 5916 S Village Dr LLC, against the defendants, Negrin LLP and Matthew Negrin, claiming that they failed to submit to an authorized method of discovery and to appear for deposition. The judge found that the plaintiff had not established that the defendants failed to appear for deposition or failed to submit to discovery, as there were ongoing discussions about scheduling the depositions and the defendants had agreed to the deposition dates suggested by the plaintiff. As a result, the judge did not find it necessary to impose sanctions or compel the depositions. The plaintiff is ordered to provide notice of the court's order and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
