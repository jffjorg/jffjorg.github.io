And here is a brief summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied a motion by Plaintiff Ardeshir Haerizadeh to amend the complaint to modify the breach of employment contract claim to become a general breach of contract claim and to reassert damages for the loss of the stock pool under the Stock Purchase Agreement and other agreements. The Court found that the proposed amendments would greatly prejudice the Landec Defendants, who have litigated this matter for over four and a half years, and that the Plaintiff's failure to timely allege a cause of action for breach of the Stock Purchase Agreement does not warrant granting the requested amendment. The Court also noted that the Plaintiff's motion was not made in good faith, as it was only made after the Court denied jury instructions relating to the held back stock, and that the proposed amendments would greatly expand the scope of the Plaintiff's breach of contract claims.
