MOTION
 
On April 3, 2024, Plaintiff SMCA Main Street Plaza LLC (“Plaintiff”)
filed the unlawful detainer complaint against Defendant BSM 2nd Street LLC
(“Defendant”).  The proof of service
indicates Defendant was served with a copy of the original summons and
complaint via substitute service on April 10, 2024.  
 
On June 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended
Complaint (“FAC”).  Defendant now demurs to
the FAC for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action.  Plaintiff opposes the demurrer.
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.     DEMURRER
 
“It is black letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of
the allegations in a complaint.”  (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015)
235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  In testing the sufficiency of a cause of
action, a court accepts “[a]s true all material facts properly pled and matters
which may be judicially noticed but disregard contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.  [A court
also gives] the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole
and its parts in their context.”  (290
Division (EAT), LLC v. City & County of San Francisco (2022) 86
Cal.App.5th 439, 450 [cleaned up]; Hacker v. Homeward Residential, Inc.
(2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 270, 280 [“in considering the merits of a demurrer,
however, “the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however
improbable they may be”].)
 
Further, in ruling on a demurrer, a court must “liberally construe”
the allegations of the complaint “with a view to substantial justice between
the parties.”  (See Code Civ. Proc., §
452.)  “This rule of liberal construction
means that the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not
the defendant.”  (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.)   
 
In summary, “[d]etermining whether the complaint is sufficient as
against the demurrer on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action, the rule is that if on consideration of all the
facts stated it appears the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of
the court against the defendants the complaint will be held good although the
facts may not be clearly stated, or may be intermingled with a statement of
other facts irrelevant to the cause of action shown, or although the plaintiff
may demand relief to which he is not entitled under the facts alleged.”  (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193
Cal.App.2d 636, 639.)
 
A.   
FAILURE TO STATE A CAUSE OF ACTION
 
“The basic elements of unlawful detainer for nonpayment of rent ...
are (1) the tenant is in possession of the premises; (2) that possession is
without permission; (3) the tenant is in default for nonpayment of rent; (4)
the tenant has been properly served with a written three-day notice; and (5)
the default continues after the three-day notice period has elapsed.”  (KB Salt Lake III, LLC v. Fitness
Internat., LLC (2023) 95 Cal.App.5th 1032, 1045.)  Thus, service of a three-day notice to quit
is an element of an unlawful detainer claim.
 
Defendant contends Plaintiff’s five-day Notice, attached to the FAC as
Exhibit 2, is overstated and therefore invalid, because the “rent” of
$22,654.71 “representing the rent due for the period Mar. 1, 2024 through Mar.
31, 2024” also includes a statement indicating, “**The total amount includes
the following items other than the base rent: $2059.54 in late fees” and is
therefore overstated on its face and deficient as a matter of law.  The Court notes that the monthly base rent is
alleged to be $20,595.37, and as such the $22k figure does appear to include
roughly $2k in late fees.
 
In support of its position, Defendant cites to Del Monte Properties
& Investments, Inc. v. Dolan (2018) 26 Cal.App.5th Supp. 20, 24-25
(hereafter Del Monte) and WDT-Winchester v. Nilsson (1994) 27
Cal.App.4th 516, 529-30 (hereafter WDT-Winchester) and Levitz
Furniture Co. v. Wingtip Communications, Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1035,
1038 (hereafter Levitz).
 
Del Monte and WDT-Winchester both involved post-judgment
appeals, not challenges to the pleadings. 
In Del Monte, the appellate court held that the notice was
defective because the plaintiff had not proven the requested late fee
satisfied the reasonable endeavor test required of liquidated damages in
unlawful detainer cases.  Similarly, in WDT-Winchester,
the appellate court held that the plaintiff failed to prove that the
requested property taxes were required under the lease.
 
Defendant cites Levitz for the general proposition that “A
notice that seeks rent in excess of the amount due is invalid and will not
support an unlawful detainer action.”  (Levitz,
supra, 86 Cal.App.4th at p. 1038.) 
However, in Levitz, the appellate court reversed the trial
court’s dismissal at the pleadings stage.
 
Thus, Defendant has not established that the inclusion of late fees in
the amount demanded in the notice is prohibited by law.  Rather, this represents a factual issue to be
resolved at later stages of the litigation.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
For the reasons stated, the Court overrules Defendant’s Demurrer.  Defendant shall file and serve an answer to
the FAC on or before October 10, 2024.   
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file the
notice with a proof of service forthwith.
