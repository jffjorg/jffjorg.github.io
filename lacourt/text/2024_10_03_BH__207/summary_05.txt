  - "If on consideration of all the facts stated it appears the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of the court against the defendants the complaint will be held good although the facts may not be clearly stated, or may be intermingled with a statement of other facts irrelevant to the cause of action shown, or although the plaintiff may demand relief to which he is not entitled under the facts alleged."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Michael E. Whitaker issued a tentative ruling on October 3, 2024, in the case of SMCA Main Street Plaza LLC v. BSM 2nd Street LLC. The case involves an unlawful detainer claim filed by SMCA against BSM for nonpayment of rent. BSM filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that the notice demanding rent is overstated due to the inclusion of late fees. The judge found that the notice is not invalid as a matter of law and that it is a factual issue to be resolved at a later stage of the litigation. The judge overruled the demurrer and ordered BSM to file and serve an answer to the First Amended Complaint by October 10, 2024.
