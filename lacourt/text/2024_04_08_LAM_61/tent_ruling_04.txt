Defendant to give notice.
 
I.                  
DEMURRER
A demurrer should be sustained only where the defects appear
on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Code Civ. Pro., §§
430.30, et seq.) In particular, as is
relevant here, a court should sustain a demurrer if a complaint does not allege
facts that are legally sufficient to constitute a cause of action. (See
id. § 430.10, subd. (e).) As the Supreme Court held in Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311:
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but
not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. . . . Further, we
give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its
parts in their context.” (Id. at
p. 318; see also Hahn. v. Mirda
(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747 [“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not
the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.
[Citation.]”) 
 
“In determining whether the complaint is sufficient as
against the demurrer … if on consideration of all the facts stated it appears
the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of the court against the
defendants the complaint will be held good although the facts may not be
clearly stated.”  (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 639.)
 
“A demurrer
for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some
respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery
procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612,
616.) Such demurrers “are disfavored,
and are granted only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant
cannot reasonably respond.” (Mahan v.
Charles W. Chan Insurance Agency, Inc. (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 841, 848.)
 
A demurrer should not be sustained without leave to amend if
the complaint, liberally construed, can state a cause of action under any
theory or if there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured by
amendment. (Schifando v. City of Los Angeles, supra, 31 Cal.4th at p.
1081.) The demurrer also may be sustained without leave to amend where the
nature of the defects and previous unsuccessful attempts to plead render it
probable plaintiff cannot state a cause of action. (Krawitz v. Rusch
(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 957, 967.)
 
Defendants State Farm General Insurance Company (State Farm)
and Tina Magee (Magee) demurrer to the third cause of action for negligent
misrepresentation against Magee. They argue that no claim for negligent
misrepresentation can be pleaded against Magee for misconduct committed in the
scope of her agency relationship with State Farm. (Demurrer at pp. 3–6.)
Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs have not sufficiently pleaded the
elements of negligent misrepresentation, including justifiable reliance.
(Demurrer at pp. 7–9.) 
 
Defendants’ argument as to Magee’s
potential liability for torts committed in the scope of employment is
unpersuasive and contradicted by authority. Specifically, the court in Bock
v. Hansen (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 215, held that “a cause of
action for negligent misrepresentation can lie against an insurance adjuster.”
Defendants attempt to distinguish this holding by noting that the
misrepresentations at issue in Bock ultimately resulted in physical
injury. (Demurrer at p. 5.)[1]
But the Bock  court recognized
that liability for negligent misrepresentation could also arise “where
information is conveyed in a commercial setting for a business purpose,” which
was the context in which the adjuster made the communication. (Id. at p.
229.) Defendants cite an unpublished federal case embracing their
interpretation of Bock (Feizbakhsh v. Travelers Commercial Insurance
Company (C.D. Cal., Sept. 9, 2016, No. LACV1602165JAKEX) 2016 WL 8732296,
at *6), the reasoning of which has since faced criticism from other federal
decisions. (See Njoku v. GEICO General Insurance Company (N.D.
Cal., May 6, 2020, No. 19-CV-07757-JST) 2020 WL 4915433, at *3.) There is no
reason to doubt that the Bock court held other than what it expressly
indicated. Adjuster liability for negligent misrepresentation is consistent
with the ordinary rule that an insurer’s agents have “a duty to abstain from
injuring the plaintiff through express misrepresentation, independent of the
insurer's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.” (Doctors' Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 49 Cal.3d 39, 48.)
However, Defendants are correct
that no claim for negligent misrepresentation is stated here. “The
elements of negligent misrepresentation are (1) a misrepresentation of a past
or existing material fact, (2) made without reasonable ground for believing it
to be true, (3) made with the intent to induce another's reliance on the fact
misrepresented, (4) justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation, and (5)
resulting damage.” (Bock, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p.
231.) Here, although Plaintiffs plead in conclusory terms that they “reasonably
relied” on Magee’s denial of their claim, this allegation is not only
unsupported by the particularity of pleading required for negligent
misrepresentation (See National Union Fire Ins.
Co. of Pittsburgh, PA v. Cambridge Integrated Services Group, Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 35, 50 [“[T]he causal elements, particularly the allegations
of reliance, must
be specifically pleaded.”]),
but is also affirmatively rebutted by the allegations that Plaintiffs do
include. Indeed, immediately after Plaintiffs allege that Magee misrepresented
the nature of their damages, there is an allegation —  not that they acted in reliance on the claim
— but that they directly contested Magee’s denial, demanded that the claim be
reopened, demanded a copy of the report upon which Magee purported to rely, and
filed a complaint with the Department of Insurance.(Complaint ¶¶ 14–18.)
 
The demurrer is therefore SUSTAINED with leave to amend to
the third cause of action.
