And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the exhibits submitted by both parties. The judge notes that the plaintiff, Lucas Murrey, exchanged text messages with the defendant, Vanessa Valdes, on the Hinge dating app, which led to Valdes making comments about him on Facebook. The judge acknowledges that Valdes did not make the comment calling Murrey "truly dangerous," but notes that her narrative of her own experience would provide context showing that the statement was non-actionable opinion. The judge also notes that Murrey's behavior, as evidenced by the text messages, may be considered harassing and threatening. The judge is considering subpoenaing Valdes's report and possibly suing her for defamation. The judge's ruling is tentative and may be subject to change based on further evidence and arguments presented at the court hearing.
