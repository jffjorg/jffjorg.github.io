And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer to the third cause of action for negligent misrepresentation against Tina Magee is sustained, with 30 days leave to amend. The demurrer was filed by State Farm General Insurance Company and Magee, who argued that no claim for negligent misrepresentation can be pleaded against Magee for misconduct committed in the scope of her agency relationship with State Farm. The judge found that while an insurance adjuster can be held liable for negligent misrepresentation, the plaintiff's complaint does not adequately plead the elements of negligent misrepresentation, including justifiable reliance. The judge noted that the plaintiff's allegations of reliance are conclusory and not supported by specific pleading, and are also rebutted by the plaintiff's own allegations that they directly contested the adjuster's denials. The judge therefore sustained the demurrer with leave to amend, allowing the plaintiff to replead the cause of action.
