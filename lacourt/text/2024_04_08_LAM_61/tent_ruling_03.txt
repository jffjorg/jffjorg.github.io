Plaintiff provides text messages exchanged between himself and Valdes on the
Hinge dating app, which formed the basis for Valdes’s later comments about him
on Facebook. (Murrey Decl. Exhs. 1–3.) Valdes attaches additional messages to
her motion, the authenticity of which Plaintiff does not challenge. These
messages are as follows:
 
PLAINTIFF (P) [commenting on a photo in which Valdes is
standing with a man]: Let’s hang [phone number]
 
VALDES (V): Bold move :)
 
P: I’m amused by how you’ll mess it up
P: Wait you already did
P: Why is there a guy in your pic genius?
 
V: I’m amused by how you think you know me well enough to talk
to me like one of your buddies.
V: Read my caption, genius.
 
P: Nobody reads captions moron
P: But it’s fun watching you burn lol
P: Listen I wish you well in your search good luck
P: Can you ever forgive me for not reading your online dating
explanations of guys in your pic dear?
P: I know my credentials are hardly worthy of you much less my
looks but can you please have your pet get it’s hair all over my nice clothes?
 
V: Listen, Lucas Murrey. You’re fucking with the wrong woman.
I’m reporting your ass. Stay away from women and get help.
 
P: Good Vanessa Loser I’m subpoenaing your idiot “report” and
possibly suing you for defamation
P: Does it upset you that I’ve broken no laws just like it’s
legal for you to a moron? [sic]
P: By the way, real decent women love me lol
P: Sorry it’s not your night
P: And yes I will read anything you or anyone else dumb enough
to frivolously “report” me say(s)
P: Try it
P: Like I said, amusing
P: “Stay away from women”? I’m sorry your so jealous when
rejected
P: And the screenshots/data of you are enough to identify you
via said subpoena
 


[2] Although
Valdes did not make the comment in which Plaintiff is called “truly dangerous,”
her narrative of her own experience would provide ample context to show this
statement as being non-actionable opinion. (Murrey Exh. 8.)
