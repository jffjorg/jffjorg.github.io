And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendants' motion for summary judgment. The Defendants, Fortifi Financial, Inc. and California Municipal Finance Authority, are administrators and/or authorized contractors of the Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) Program. The Plaintiff, Angel Cordova, alleges that the Defendants engaged in fraud by soliciting him to build an Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) on his property, and that they made false representations and forged his signatures on documents to create PACE assessments on his property without his knowledge.

The Judge has concluded that the Defendants have met their burden to demonstrate that the Plaintiff cannot establish his fraud-based claims. Specifically, the Judge has found that the Defendants did not make any false representations to the Plaintiff, and that they relied on the Plaintiff's false representations that the funds would be used to construct PACE-eligible improvements, rather than an ADU.

The Judge has also granted the Defendants' motions for summary adjudication of the Plaintiff's causes of action for negligence, cancellation of assessment agreement and lien, and violations of the California Home Solicitations Act. The Judge has found that the Plaintiff has failed to establish a triable issue of material fact in support of these claims.

Finally, the Judge has granted the Defendants' motion for summary adjudication of the Plaintiff's request for declaratory relief, finding that the Plaintiff is not entitled to a declaration in his favor. The Judge has ordered the Defendants to file a proposed judgment consistent with this ruling, and has given notice.
