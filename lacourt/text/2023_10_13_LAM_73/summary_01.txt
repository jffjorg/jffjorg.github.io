Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on OppFi's two motions to seal certain court records. The Judge notes that the California Supreme Court held in NBC Subsidiary v. Superior Court that the First Amendment provides a right of access to ordinary civil trial and proceedings, and that the Judicial Council promulgated rules to implement this principle. The Judge also notes that a court may order a record to be filed under seal only if it finds facts that establish an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record.

The Judge finds that OppFi has carried its burden regarding certain documents, including Exhibit A to Wu declaration and Exhibit C, but does not carry its burden regarding other documents. The Judge also finds that OppFi has carried its burden regarding certain documents submitted in its opposition, including McKay declaration paragraphs 13.b and 13.d and Exhibit A to McKay declaration. The Judge notes that OppFi is a publicly traded entity and that FinWise is a highly regulated bank.

The Judge orders the parties' memoranda and any other ancillary documents to follow the court's ruling on sealing. The Judge also points out that the court's ruling on sealing is based on a balancing inquiry, dependent on the facts and circumstances of the particular case.
