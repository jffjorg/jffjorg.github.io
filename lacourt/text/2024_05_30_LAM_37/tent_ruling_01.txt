Background
 
On April
24, 2023, Joseph Nguyen, D.C. Chiropractic, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed a
Complaint against Southwest Legal Group (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 100,
alleging a single cause of action for conversion. 
 
On October
11, 2023, Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging a single
cause of action for conversion. Defendant demurred to the FAC and moved to
strike Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages. Plaintiff opposed the Motion. The
court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend and granted Defendant’s motion
to strike with leave to amend. 
 
On March
23, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”)
alleging the same single cause of action for conversion. Defendant now demurs
to the SAC and moves to strike Plaintiff’s request for Attorney’s fees and
Punitive Damages.  Plaintiff opposes the
motion.  The matter is now before the
court. 
Discussion
 
I.         Legal
Standard
 
A.        Demurrer 
 
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿“To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only
allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that
might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.”¿(C.A.
v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53
Cal.4th 861, 872.)¿For the
purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of
action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded.¿
(Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)¿A
demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or
law.”¿(Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿ 
 
B.        Motion
to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP § 436(a)-(b); Stafford
v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not
essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be
stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave to
Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer is
reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally granted
to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Demurrer[1]
 
A.        Conversion
 
To plead a cause of action for conversion, one
must allege (1) the plaintiff’s ownership or right to possession of personal
property; (2) defendant’s disposition of the property inconsistent with
plaintiff’s rights; and (3) resulting damages. (Fremont Indemnity Co. v.
Fremont General Corp.(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.) “Money may be
the subject of conversion if the claim involves a specific, identifiable sum .
. . .” (WelcoElectronics, Inc. v. Mora (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 202,
209.) 
 
The SAC alleges that Plaintiff entered into
agreements with Defendants’ clients to provide medical services to Defendants’
clients. (SAC ¶ 5.) Each client gave Plaintiff a lien against any proceeds
received by Defendants on the clients’ behalf and Defendants had notice of the
liens and agreed to hold and maintain Plaintiff’s money in trust until the
liens were discharged. Plaintiff billed a total of $190,115 for services
rendered. (SAC ¶¶ 6, 7.) Defendants used the bills provided by Plaintiff to
settle personal injury cases. (SAC ¶ 7.) 
 
Defendant demurs to the conversion claim on the
basis that Plaintiff failed to include any information as to the dates stated
and the amount of each lien agreement in controversy. Defendant further asserts
that the SAC is fatally vague and uncertain on those grounds. (CCP § 430.10(f))
The court disagrees with the proposition that Plaintiff must provide
information as to dates, what each lien relates to, and the amount of each lien
in dispute to survive the demurrer because such specificity is not required so long
as Plaintiff pleads the essential facts of a conversion claim. (See Gressley
v. Williams (1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644 [Sufficient
facts are the essential facts of the case "with reasonable precision and
with particularity sufficiently specific to acquaint the defendant with the
nature, source, and extent of his cause of action”].)  Here,
Plaintiff stated the necessary facts to show there is a specific identifiable
sum of money is in dispute. 
 
The demurrer to the conversion cause of action
is overruled. 
 
III.      Motion
to Strike
 
Defendant moves to strike Paragraph 17 from the
SAC which alleges: 
 
As a direct result of Defendants’
malicious and willful conduct, Plaintiff was
damaged. As a direct and proximate result
of the conduct of Defendants, Plaintiff has been damaged in the amount of
$190,115, together with incidental and consequential damages. Plaintiff is
informed and believes and on the basis of said information and belief alleges
that Defendants’ conduct was taken with the intent to permanently injure
Plaintiff, or with a willful and conscious disregard of Plaintiff’s rights and
property. Additionally, Plaintiff has incurred attorneys fees and other costs
in connection with this matter. Additionally, Plaintiff has suffered incidental
and consequential damages.
 
The general rule is that attorney’s fees are
not a proper item of recovery from the adverse party, either as costs, damages
or otherwise, unless there is express statutory authority or contractual
liability therefor. (Russell v. United Pacific Ins. Co. (1963) 214
Cal.App.2d 78, 29.) Here, the SAC fails to identify a contractual or statutory
basis for attorney’s fees. Civ. Code § 3336, which sets out the measure of
damages in conversion actions, does not provide for attorney’s fees for the
converting of property. It has long been held that attorney’s fees are not a
type of damage provided for by section 3336. (Id. at p.91).  Furthermore, Civ. Code § 3294, the statute for
punitive damages, also does not provide for attorney’s fees.
 
Plaintiff’s opposition asserts that “a means
for recovery of attorney’s fees may arise during the case” such that “it is
improper to strike the prayer for attorney’s fees” but fails to state the legal
basis that would support Plaintiff’s recovery of attorney’s fees. (Opp. at p.
4:6-8.) Thus, the Court grants Defendant’s motion to
strike without leave to amend as to the claim for attorney’s fees.
 
Defendant also moves to strike Paragraph 18
from the SAC which alleges: 
 
Plaintiff is informed and believes and on
the basis of said information and
belief alleges that Defendants' conduct
was taken with the intent to injure
Plaintiff, or with a willful and
conscious disregard of Plaintiff's rights and
property. Plaintiff is informed and
believes and on the basis of said information
and belief alleges that such fraudulent
conduct constitutes clear and convincing
evidence of despicable, outrageous,
oppressive, and malicious conduct
pursuant to California Civil Code § 3294.
As such, Plaintiff is entitled to
punitive damages and exemplary damages
against Defendants herein for the
sake of example and to punish Defendants
for their unlawful conduct.
 
(SAC ¶ 18.)
 
To state a
claim for punitive damages under Civ. Code § 3294, a plaintiff must allege
specific facts showing that the defendant has been guilty of malice, oppression
or fraud. (Smith v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal. App. 4th 1033, 1042.)¿
The basis for punitive damages must be pled with specificity; conclusory
allegations devoid of any factual assertions are insufficient. (Id.)¿¿
“Malice” is defined in Civ. Code § 3294 (c)(1) as “conduct which is intended by
the defendant to cause injury” or “despicable conduct which is carried on by
the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of
others.” “Oppression” is defined as “despicable conduct subjecting a person to
cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.”
(Civ. Code § 3294(c)(2).) The term “despicable” has been defined in the case
law as actions that are “base,” “vile,” or “contemptible.” (Shade Foods,
Inc. v. Innovative Products Sales & Marketing, Inc. (2000) 78
Cal.App.4th 847, 891.) Fraud means “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit,
or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on
the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal
rights or otherwise causing injury.” (Civ. Code § 3294(c)(3).)¿
 
The court
finds Plaintiff fails to plead facts sufficient to show that Plaintiff is
entitled to punitive damages. Plaintiff must allege facts to show that Anthony R.
Lopez was Defendant’s managing agent who acted or ratified conduct that was
done with malice, oppression, or fraud in interfering with Plaintiff’s liens. When the defendant is a¿corporation, “the
oppression, fraud, or malice must be perpetrated, authorized, or knowingly
ratified by an officer, director, or managing agent of the¿corporation.” (Wilson
v. Southern California Edison Company (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 123, 164; see
Civ. Code, § 3294(b).) Plaintiff
must also allege what the specific “interfering” conduct was and state facts
that the conduct was intentional or done with conscious disregard for the
Plaintiff’s rights. 
 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion to strike punitive damages is granted with leave to amend. 
 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant’s
demurrer is overruled. Defendant’s motion to strike is granted without leave to

amend as
to the claim for attorney’s fees and with 10 days leave to amend as to the
claim for 
punitive
damages. OSC re: Amended Complaint is scheduled for June 13, 2024, at 8:30
a.m.
