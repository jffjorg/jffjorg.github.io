```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

"The Court has considered Sami Ammari's motion to vacate the default judgment entered in favor of Razan Ammari. Sami's motion is based on Code of Civil Procedure Section 473(b), which allows for relief from a default judgment due to excusable mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. However, the Court finds that Sami's excuse for failing to respond to the First Amended Complaint is not credible. Specifically, Steven Tamer, Sami's counsel, claims that he failed to respond to the FAC because he believed he was relieved as Sami's counsel on October 17, 2022. However, the Court finds that this excuse is not supported by evidence and that Tamer was not officially relieved as counsel until a hearing on November 30, 2020, nearly two years later. Furthermore, Tamer's declaration does not provide sufficient evidence of an excusable mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect that would justify relief from the default judgment. Therefore, the Court denies Sami's motion to vacate the default judgment and the default judgment against Sami stands."
