And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to vacate and set aside the judgment entered on January 2, 2024. This is the fourth time the defendant has attempted to challenge the judgment, and the previous three attempts were unsuccessful. The defendant claims that court employees engaged in extrinsic fraud and improper conduct, but provides no evidence to support these claims. The judge finds that the defendant has not shown that the judgment is void or that there has been any clerical mistake, and therefore denies the motion.
