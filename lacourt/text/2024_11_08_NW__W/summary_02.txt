And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, demurrer to the complaint, and motion to strike punitive damages. The court denies the motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, finding that the untimely filing of the complaint was done with good cause and did not prejudice the defendants.

The court sustains the demurrer to the tenth and eleventh causes of action, finding that the allegations are insufficient to state a claim. The court overrules the demurrer to the thirteenth cause of action, finding that the statute of limitations has run.

The court denies the motion to strike the second amended complaint, finding that the allegations regarding punitive damages are sufficient.

Overall, the court's tentative ruling is in favor of the defendants on some claims, but against them on others. The parties may object to the tentative ruling and request a hearing to argue the issues further.
