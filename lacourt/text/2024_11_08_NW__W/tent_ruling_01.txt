BACKGROUND
 
This is a unlawful detainer action.  There is a written Residential Lease
Agreement (“Lease”) governing the parties tenancy.  Defendants breached the lease by failing to pay
rent April 2023, May 2023, June 2023, July 2023, August 2023, and September
2023. The total amount of rent due for this period is $20,400.
 
On September 14, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with the
City of Los Angeles
Renter Protections Notice (the “LARP Notice”) and Three-Day
Notice to Pay Rent or Quit (the “Pay Notice”). The Pay Notice was served by
posting and mailing. True and correct copies of the Pay Notice and LARP Notice
are attached to the complaint. On September 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed the Pay
Notice with the Los Angeles Housing Department.
 
The period stated in the Pay Notice expired on September 19,
2023. Defendant
failed to comply with the requirements of the Pay Notice as
of this date in that she failed to pay rent or vacate and surrender possession
of the Premises to Plaintiff.
8. Holdover damages are at least $113.33 per day, and these
damages accrue beginning October 1, 2023.
 
Plaintiff filed the complaint on October 10, 2023.
 
Judgment
of possession was entered in favor of Tradewinds Blue, LLC on January 2, 2024.
On March 29, 2024, defendant brought an ex parte application to vacate the
judgment pursuant to FRCP Rule 60(B)(4). That application was denied on the
same date by the court. 
 
On
July 5, 2024, defendant filed a Notice of Renewal of Motion and Motion for
Relief from Judgment Not Void on its face. The motion indicated that it was
brought pursuant to C.C.P. Section 1008 and 473(d). Judge Keeny denied the
motion on the grounds that the defendant had not shown she had served plaintiff
and even if properly served, it is an improper request for reconsideration, as
it does not present any new evidence, facts or law that would support
reconsideration of the court’s earlier decision. Specifically,  there was no evidence that Judicial Assistant
Redman engaged in any unethical or unlawful conduct.
 
Defendant
again moves to vacate and set aside judgment on the grounds that court employees
 engaged in dishonest practices that are fraudulent,
deceitful and disrupted the lawful functions and procedures of the Superior
Court of the State of California-Van Nuys Courthouse East.  
 
 [Tentative] Ruling
 
DENY
 
This is the fourth time defendant has attempted to challenge
the judgment entered herein.  The
previous three attempts were not successful. 
This time is no different.  
 
Defendant claims there has been extrinsic fraud and improper
conduct by four court employees. The defendant offers no evidence of fraud or
improper conduct or explanation as to why such evidence could not have been offered
at previous hearings.
 
Additionally, defendant cites CCP § 86(b)(3) which simply
identifies certain types of cases as cases in equity and classified as limited
jurisdiction.  This statute is
inapplicable.   
 
Defendant cites Code Civ. Proc. 128(a)(8) which states:
“Every court shall have the power to do all of the following: … (8) To amend
and control its processes and orders so as to make them conform to law and
justice…” This statute does not permit the Court to vacate a judgment.
 
Defendant also cites CCP § 473(d) which allows a court to
fix clerical mistakes or set aside void judgments.  Defendant has not identified any clerical
mistake, or any evidence backed reason that the judgment is void.
