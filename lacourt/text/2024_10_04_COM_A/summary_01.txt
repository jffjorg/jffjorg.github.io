And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Eric D. Paris, Esq., counsel for plaintiff Frederick Douglas Thomas, Jr., et al., to be relieved as counsel for the plaintiff. The motion was filed due to the fact that counsel has lost contact with the plaintiff since October 22, 2021, and despite reasonable efforts to locate the plaintiff, counsel has been unable to confirm a current address. The court had previously continued the motion to allow counsel to serve the motion and related documents by delivering the notice or papers to the clerk of the court, which counsel has done. As all requirements for relief have been met, the motion is granted, and the order will be effective upon the filing of proof of service of the signed order with the clerk of the court.
