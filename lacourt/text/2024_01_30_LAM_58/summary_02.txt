Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to transfer the venue to Orange County. The plaintiff's complaint alleges that the defendant, Reliant Real Estate Management, Inc., failed to provide copies of investigative consumer reports during the application process for tenancy. The defendant argued that Orange County is the proper venue because it is the location of its principal place of business and the residence of its officers and directors. The judge found that the defendant has met its burden of demonstrating that Orange County is a proper venue. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's opposition did not address the request to transfer venue to Orange County, and therefore, the motion is granted. The judge retains discretionary authority to transfer the action to the Orange County Superior Court or the Santa Monica County Superior Court if deemed necessary.
