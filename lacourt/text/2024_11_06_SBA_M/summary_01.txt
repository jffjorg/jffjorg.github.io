And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents. The plaintiff brought a "Lemon Law" case against BMW of North America, LLC, alleging that the company's 2024 BMW 750c vehicle suffered from widespread defects and was unable to be repaired within a reasonable number of attempts.

The judge denied the motion in part, finding that some of the requests were overly broad or vague. However, the judge granted the motion in part, finding that Defendant failed to provide adequate responses to certain requests. Specifically, the judge ordered Defendant to serve further documents in compliance with requests regarding diagnostic trouble codes, summaries of warranty repair payments, and customer complaints.

The judge also noted that the motion was moot in part, as Defendant had already served further responses to certain requests. The judge waived the requirement for an informal discovery conference prior to the hearing, but noted that it will be required for future motions. The judge ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling.
