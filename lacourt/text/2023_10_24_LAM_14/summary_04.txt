And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's request for judicial notice regarding Exhibits 7 and 13, but only as to the existence of the documents and the fact that certain statements were made, not as to the truth of the contents. The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike paragraphs 27-29, 51, and Exhibit F from the plaintiff's SAC. The judge finds that the letter sent by the defendant's counsel before the action began is still a fact that may be relevant to the case, even if it does not form the basis for a cause of action. The judge concludes that the litigation privilege protects a party from causes of action, but not from the recitation of facts or the production of evidence. As such, the motion to strike is denied.
