 Case Number:  22STCV32918    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2023    Dept:  14 Instant Motion
 
            Defendant
Cordoba now moves this court for an order striking paragraphs 27-29, 51, and
Exhibit F from Plaintiff’s SAC.
 
Decision
 
            Plaintiff’s
Request for Judicial Notice (“RJN”) is GRANTED as to Exhibits 7 and 13,
and otherwise GRANTED as to the existence
of the documents, and the fact that certain statements were made, not as to the
truth of the contents. Lockley v. Law Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich,
Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 882.
 
            The motion is
DENIED.
 
Discussion
 
            The
challenged portions of the SAC reference a letter that Defendant Cordoba’s
counsel sent to Plaintiff before this action began. That letter was the basis
of Plaintiff’s earlier claims against the Attorney Defendants. This court
ordered the claims against the Attorney Defendants stricken pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure § 425.16. At this court’s direction, Plaintiff has
subsequently removed those claims from his operative pleadings.
 
            Defendant
Cordoba now argues that the letter is irrelevant, because it cannot form the
basis for any of Plaintiff’s claims. This is incorrect. As the court explained
in its order on the anti-SLAPP motion, the litigation privilege is not an
evidentiary objection. (Order filed February 28, 2023, p. 2). While the sending
of the letter may not give rise to a cause of action, it is still a fact. It still
forms part of the broader picture of this case, and may still be introduced as
evidence to prove or disprove some other fact which does give rise to a
cause of action.
 
Conclusion
 
            The
litigation privilege protects a party from causes of action. It does not
protect them from the recitation of facts or the production of evidence. These
portions of the SAC are not properly subject to a motion to strike. Therefore,
the motion is DENIED.
