[4] “Four
elements must ordinarily be proved to establish an equitable estoppel: (1) The
party to be estopped must know the facts; (2) he must intend that his conduct
shall be acted upon, or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel had
the right to believe that it was so intended; (3) the party asserting the estoppel
must be ignorant of the true state of facts; and, (4) he must rely upon the
conduct to his injury.” (Quoting Ashou v. Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co.
(2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 748, 766–767).


[5] See Hawkins
v. KPMG LLP (N.D. Cal. 2006) 423 F.Supp.2d 1038, 1051 (plaintiff’s claims
“depend only on the sale of the tax shelter as a whole. The complex innards of
the shelter are for all relevant purposes a black box”).
 


[6] It is worth
noting also that recent appellate authority has expressed a reluctance to find equitable
estoppel in contract cases where the result would be the loss of a party’s
constitutional right to a jury trial. See Pillar Project AG v. Payward Ventures,
Inc. (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 671, 680-681.
 


[7] In the
BMW cases, the agreement contained a provision including “affiliates” of the
dealer as well. BMW routinely argues that it is an “affiliate” of the dealer,
which made it a third-party beneficiary by the strict definition of the terms
of the Agreement. This court had other issues with the use of terms in those
agreements which do not apply here.
 


[8] In
nearly every other lemon law case this court has handled, the auto manufacturer
has taken the position that it has no agency relationship with its dealers. In
all of those discussions, the manufacturer was the putative principal and the
dealer the supposed agent. No manufacturer, or consumer either for that matter,
has argued that in fact the dealer is the principal and the manufacturer the
agent. It is always hard to evaluate a position no one has taken, but it
appears facially absurd to suppose that a local dealer is the principal of a global
manufacturer.
 


[9] Because Defendant
Mercedes is not a party to the agreement and therefore is not entitled to
enforce it at all, this analysis does not and need not consider Plaintiff’s
argument that the Agreement is unconscionable.
