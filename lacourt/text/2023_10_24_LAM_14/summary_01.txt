And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Plaintiffs Moy LLC and Kerry to compel Defendant Hui to sit for the remaining two sessions of his deposition. The dispute centers on who should do the questioning, with Defendant Hui objecting that M2K and Kwan should get their turn. However, the judge finds that Defendant Hui agreed to sit for five sessions of deposition, and who asks the questions should not be material to him. The judge also notes that counsel for M2K and Kwan has agreed to let the Plaintiff's continue their questioning, thus waiving any objection on the basis of time allocation. The judge orders Defendant Hui to sit for the remaining two sessions of deposition, as agreed, and notes that the case is not yet past its 5-year date.
