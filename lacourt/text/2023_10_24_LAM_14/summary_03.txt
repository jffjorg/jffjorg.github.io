And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving rent skimming. The Cross-Complainant has demurred to the Cross-Complaint, arguing that it fails to state a cause of action and is uncertain. The Judge has sustained the demurrer, giving the Cross-Complainant 30 days to amend the Cross-Complaint. The Judge found that the Cross-Complainant has not properly alleged that he is one of the persons authorized to file a civil suit for rent skimming, as specified in Civil Code § 891. The Judge noted that the Cross-Complainant is not a seller, mortgagee, beneficiary, or tenant, and has not alleged that he is named on any outstanding mortgage or deed of trust secured by the property. Therefore, the Judge granted the demurrer and gave the Cross-Complainant an opportunity to make the proper allegations in the amended Cross-Complaint.
