Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the motion filed by Defendant Mercedes to stay the case and compel arbitration. The motion is based on an arbitration agreement signed between the Plaintiff and a leasing dealership. The judge finds that the Plaintiff is bound by the agreement, but Defendant Mercedes is not a signatory to the agreement and therefore cannot enforce it. The judge also finds that the doctrine of equitable estoppel does not apply in this case, as the Plaintiff's claims arise from the lemon law statutes and not from the contract causes of action. Additionally, the judge finds that Defendant Mercedes is not a third-party beneficiary to the agreement. As a result, the motion to compel arbitration is denied.
