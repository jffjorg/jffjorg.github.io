And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on various motions filed by the defendants, Anny, Normandie, Jamison, and Vine. The motions include a request to strike punitive damages allegations and the prayer for injunctive relief. The Judge denies all of these motions. The ruling notes that the availability of punitive damages and injunctive relief cannot be determined at the pleading stage and must be left for a summary adjudication motion or a trial. The Judge also sustains the demurrer to the third cause of action and overrules the demurrer to the sixth cause of action.
