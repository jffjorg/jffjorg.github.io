 Case Number:  20STCV26487    Hearing Date:   October 12, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  10/12/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  20STCV26487; MIRNA GARCIA ANG vs ABSOLUTE TRANSPORTATION, INC., et al. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  SOPOT TRANS INC (DOE 1); and  SOPOT TRANS INC (DOE 51) RECOMMENDATION:  DENY for the reasons stated below.  TENTATIVE  The request for default judgment submitted on August 24, 2023 is DENIED for the following reasons:  The Court previously informed Plaintiff that she must dismiss all parties against whom judgment is not sought, including all unnamed Doe Defendants. (Min. Order, July 20, 2023.) Plaintiff still has not dismissed Does 2-50 and Does 52-100. (CRC, Rule 3.1800(a)(7).)  Plaintiff filed two Amendments to Complaint naming Sopot Trans Inc. as Doe 1 and Doe 51. As the Court previously noted, Sopot Trans Inc. as Doe 1 and Doe 51 are the same Defendant, and Plaintiff should file one CIV-100 form for both since Plaintiff is seeking the same amount of damages against the same defendant. This is also to avoid duplicative judgments. Instead, Plaintiff again submits two separate CIV-100 forms. In the amended default package, Plaintiff should also use the most recent judicial council form CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2023].  Further, Plaintiff must submit admissible and authenticated evidence in support of her purported damages. Plaintiff provides no records attached to her declaration. Instead, Plaintiff’s counsel submits two declarations attesting to Plaintiff’s injuries, and with attached unauthenticated records. A declaration in support of injuries must be made by a percipient witness with personal knowledge of the damages; as Plaintiff’s counsel, counsel necessarily is not a percipient witness to the incident to attest to her damages. Authenticated medical and billing records should be attached as part of Plaintiff’s declaration.   Plaintiff properly submitted a single proposed order on JUD-100 in the amended default package, but fails to properly name defendant in item 5(a). Because Sopot Trans Inc. was sued as DOE 1 and DOE 51, and Plaintiff declares it is jointly and severally liable for the same amount, Plaintiff’s JUD-100 must indicate that Defendant Sopot Trans Inc. is both DOE 1 and DOE 51 for accuracy; instead, Plaintiff merely states “Sopot Trans, Inc.”   This is the second time that the Court has identified the same defects of the necessary dismissal of all unnamed Doe Defendants and filing a single CIV-100 form, which Plaintiff has failed to correct. Plaintiff has failed to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed for failure to comply with the Court’s prior orders. Accordingly, the Court hereby imposes monetary sanctions of $500 payable within 30 days.  No later than ________________________, Plaintiff is to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects.  Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued to _____________________________.
