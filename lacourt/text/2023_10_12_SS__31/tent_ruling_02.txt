 Case Number:  20STCV20703    Hearing Date:   October 12, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  10/12/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  20STCV20703 CRYSTAL COLEMAN, et al. vs JOHN DOE, et al. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  Joshua Randles (Doe 1) RECOMMENDATION:  DENY for reasons stated below.  TENTATIVE  Plaintiff Renee Larkins (“Larkins”) seeks default judgment against Defendant Joshua Randles (Doe 1) (“Randles”) for $2,820 in special damages, $1 million in general damages, and $634.67 in costs.  Plaintiff Crystal Coleman (“Coleman”) also seeks default judgment against Randles for $1,475 in special damages, $1 million in general damages, and $1,174.52 in costs.  Larkins’ and Coleman’s (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) request for default judgment, submitted on May 5, 2023, are DENIED for the same reasons:  Both request default judgment on an outdated CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2020] form. Plaintiffs must use CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2023].   The proposed order is on pleading paper instead of on form JUD-100. Plaintiffs are to use judicial council form JUD-100 [New January 1, 2002].   Plaintiffs failed to file a declaration under penalty of perjury with admissible evidence in support of amount of damages sought. (CRC 3.1800(a)(2).) Instead, Plaintiffs submit only the declaration of their attorney of record, who is necessarily not a percipient witness with personal knowledge of the damages sought.  Plaintiffs must also submit a copy of the Statement of Damages served on Defendant. (CRC 3.250(a)(20).) Furthermore, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that the Statement of Damages was served on Randles prior to obtaining his default with a proof of service; otherwise, default will be void. (CCP 425.11.)  Plaintiffs dismissed Defendant John Doe, but have yet to dismiss all the other unnamed Doe Defendants (namely Does 2-50) against whom default judgment is not sought. (CRC 3.1800(a)(7).)  Although the CIV-100 forms do not request interest, Plaintiffs’ counsel’s declaration improperly requests interest in the amount of 10% per year. First, “prejudgment interest may not be awarded on costs, because costs, like prejudgment interest, ‘are not part of the judgment.’” (Bean v. Pacific Coast Elevator Corp. (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 1423,1430, citing Hess v. Ford Motor Co. (2002) 27 Cal.4th 516, 533.) Second, Plaintiffs do not establish they are entitled to prejudgment interest. Prejudgment interest is generally not awarded for damages arising from personal injury for bodily harm, pain, and suffering in personal injury actions because such are "inherently nonpecuniary, unliquidated and not readily subject to precise calculation." (See Greater Westchester Homeowners Assn. v. Los Angeles (1979) 26 Cal.3d 86, 103.)  Furthermore, Plaintiffs submit no evidence of their alleged damages, such as medical records and medical bills. A plaintiff must introduce admissible prima facie evidence of damages. (Johnson v. Stanhiser (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 357, 361.)   Plaintiffs must provide authenticated documents in support of both special and general damages. Additionally, the Court notes that both Plaintiffs request an astronomical sum of general damages in relation to the special damages purportedly incurred. Each Plaintiff requests $1 million in general damages, which represents 354x the amount of Plaintiff Larkins’ claimed special damages, and 677x the amount of Plaintiff Coleman’s claimed special damages. In the amended default packages, Plaintiffs are to consider lowering the amount to a figure reasonably supported by admissible evidence. The Court will not award speculative and conjectural damages.   No later than _______________, Plaintiffs are to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued to ________________.
