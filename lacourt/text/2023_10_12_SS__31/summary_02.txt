And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the request for default judgment against Joshua Randles (Doe 1) for various reasons. The plaintiffs, Renee Larkins and Crystal Coleman, failed to use the correct CIV-100 form, which is outdated. They also failed to file a declaration under penalty of perjury with admissible evidence in support of the amount of damages sought. Additionally, they failed to provide authenticated documents in support of both special and general damages. The court notes that the amount of general damages requested is astronomical and not supported by admissible evidence. The plaintiffs are ordered to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.
