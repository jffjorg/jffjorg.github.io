And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions, which sought to strike the plaintiff's complaint and/or dismiss the action with prejudice due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery orders. The plaintiff failed to provide further responses to discovery requests and did not pay monetary sanctions as ordered by the court. However, the plaintiff has since demonstrated compliance by providing responses and paying the past due sanctions in full. The court finds that terminating sanctions are not warranted and instead awards the defendant monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,110 to reimburse the defendant for attorney fees and costs.
