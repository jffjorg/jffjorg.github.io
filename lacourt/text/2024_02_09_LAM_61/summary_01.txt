Significant Statements:
  - "Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there is a willful discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence showing that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules."

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted FML Management Corp.'s motion for terminating sanctions against Luis Herrera. The judge found that Herrera failed to comply with a previous discovery order and has demonstrated a history of abuse. The judge also noted that Herrera failed to file an opposition to the motion. The judge believes that terminating sanctions are justified in this case, as Herrera's noncompliance was willful and there is evidence that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules. The judge has ordered that Herrera's claims be dismissed and has granted FML Management Corp.'s motion for terminating sanctions.
