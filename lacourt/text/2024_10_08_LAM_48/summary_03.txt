And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to compel a mental examination of Plaintiff Jose Mendez is granted. The motion was filed by Defendant California L&M Investments, Inc. on September 11, 2024, and the hearing is scheduled for October 8, 2024.

The judge found that there is good cause to order the mental examination, as the Plaintiff has refused to stipulate to the examination and has not provided any alternative means of discovering the information sought. The judge also noted that the Plaintiff has not received treatment for emotional distress due to inability to afford healthcare, and therefore, the information sought cannot be alternatively obtained through treatment records or other means.

The judge also found that the Defendant's motion complies with Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.310, and that the proposed examination date is prior to the motion's hearing date, but this discrepancy is easily remedied and is not grounds to deny the motion.

The judge ordered that the examination should take place with appropriate safeguards and clarification as to what is truly intended by the test. The judge also noted that the parties should be prepared to discuss scheduling a new date for the examination at the hearing.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any submissions by the parties, and the parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org indicating their intention to submit.
