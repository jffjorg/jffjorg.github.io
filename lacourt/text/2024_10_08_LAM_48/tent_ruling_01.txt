  CASE NO.: 21STCV08177
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
October 8, 2024



 
Christopher
Q. Pham, counsel of record for Plaintiff John P. Middleton (formerly named as
John Roe), seeks to be relieved as counsel. 
Counsel’s declaration states that Plaintiff has breached the terms of
his engagement agreement by failing to pay outstanding attorney fees.  There has been a breakdown in communications
that renders continued representation unreasonably difficult, Plaintiff refuses
to follow counsel’s legal advice, and an express conflict of interest has
materialized.  No party opposed the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial is not until November 3, 2025, and there
is no prejudice to Plaintiff.
The
unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 orders and this order on John
P. Middleton and all parties who have appeared.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 8th day of October 2024
