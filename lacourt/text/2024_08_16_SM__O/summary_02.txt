And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's application to continue the trial date without prejudice, but allows the plaintiff to file a summary judgment motion based on the current trial date. If the motion is filed in a timely manner, the court will consider continuing the trial date for a short period (under 30 days) to allow the motion to be heard. The defendant may contact the clerk after the motion is filed to submit a proposed stipulation and order. The court does not anticipate argument on this matter at the upcoming hearing.
