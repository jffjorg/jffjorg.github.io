stipulated discovery case management order that schedules the dates for all
remaining depositions and further written discovery (if any).  Except for expert discovery, the court
anticipates no extension of the discovery cut off will be granted other than
for what is included in the stipulation or by virtue of a motion to reopen or
extend the deadline on good cause shown.

conforming request.  The court does not
anticipate hearing argument on this matter today.
