 Case Number:  22SMCV02032    Hearing Date:   August 16, 2024    Dept:  O The application is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE if plaintiff
timely files a summary judgment/adjudication motion based on the current trial
date.  The prior stipulation to continue
was denied and the trial will not be continued to allow more discovery in an
effort to bring an untimely summary judgment motion.  However, if the motion for summary judgment
is timely filed, the court will then consider continuing the trial date for a
short period (under 30 days) to allow the motion to be heard.  Defendant may contact the clerk after the
timely summary judgment motion is filed and submit a proposed stipulation and
order.  The court does not anticipate
argument on this matter today.
