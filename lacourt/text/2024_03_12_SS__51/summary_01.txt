And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to strike or tax costs. The plaintiff, Viviriana Guatemala, filed a motion to strike or tax costs, arguing that the defendant's costs were not reasonably necessary and were not supported by the evidence. The defendant, Erika Derias, et al., argued that the plaintiff's claims were frivolous and that the costs were reasonable.

The judge found that the plaintiff's arguments failed because the Court of Appeal had previously affirmed the trial court's award of costs, and the plaintiff had not presented any new evidence to challenge the costs. The judge also found that the costs were reasonably necessary and were not excessive.

The judge also denied the plaintiff's request to exercise discretion to deny the award of costs. The plaintiff argued that the defendant's counsel had not been involved in the case since 2020 and that the costs for counsel's pro hac vice appearance were not reasonably necessary. The judge found that the defendant's counsel had been involved in the case since 2020 and that the costs were reasonably necessary.

The judge's ruling is based on the legal standard that the prevailing party is entitled to recover costs in a civil action, unless the costs are not reasonably necessary or are excessive. The judge found that the defendant's costs were reasonably necessary and were not excessive.

The plaintiff's motion to strike or tax costs is denied, and the defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted.
