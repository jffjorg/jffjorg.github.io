STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS: 
 
Plaintiff¿Viviriana Guatemala¿(“Plaintiff”) brings this
employment action against¿Defendants Regus Management Group, LLC (“Regus”),
Erika Deras (“Deras”), and Does (collectively “Defendants”) alleging that she
was subject to discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and termination based
on her disability.¿ 
¿ 
On February 28, 2019, Plaintiff filed a Complaint, and on
February 18, 2020, the operative Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”) against
Defendants for the following causes of action:¿ 
(1)¿Disability Harassment in Violation of the FEHA;¿ 
(2)¿Disability Discrimination in Violation of the FEHA;¿ 
(3)¿Disability Retaliation in Violation of the FEHA;¿ 
(4) Failure
to Engage in Good-Faith Interactive Process in Violation of the FEHA; 
(5) Failure
to Accommodate in Violation of the FEHA; 
(6)
Violation of CFRA; 
(7) Whistleblower
Violation in Violation of Lab. Code § 1102.5; 
(8)
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (“IIED”); and 
(9)
Wrongful Termination of Employment in Violation of Public Policy. 
 
On September 30, 2020, the Court sustained a demurrer as to
the first through sixth and eighth causes of action without leave to amend. The
only remaining causes of action are seventh and ninth. 
 
On April 7, 2021, Defendants filed a motion for summary
judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication.
 
On May 6, 2021, Plaintiff also filed a motion for summary
adjudication as to the ninth cause of action only.
 
On September 8, 2021, the court granted Defendants’ motion
for summary judgment and denied Plaintiff’s motion for summary adjudication.
Judgment was entered in favor of Defendants on September 30 2021.
 
On October 7, 2021, Defendants filed a memorandum of costs.
 
On October 26, 2021, Plaintiff filed a motion to tax costs,
arguing that her claims are all intertwined with Plaintiff’s FEHA allegations.
Accordingly, Plaintiff argued that the FEHA exception applies such that a
prevailing defendant in a FEHA action is only entitled to recover costs if it
can be established that plaintiff’s claims were “frivolous, unreasonable or
groundless” or “without foundation.” Plaintiff, therefore, asked this court to strike
all costs. Alternatively, Plaintiff argued that the court should strike all of
Defendants’ costs as unsupported. Finally, Plaintiff requested that the court
deny costs due to Plaintiff’s current financial condition.
 
On November 23, 2021, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal.
 
On January 27, 2022, the court found that Defendants are
entitled to all reasonable costs incurred after September 30, 2020. For
pre-September 30, 2022 costs, the court found that Defendants were entitled to
reasonable costs for non-FEHA related claims only. The court requested
supplemental briefing from the parties and, on March 11, 2022, taxed $5,311.65
in costs and awarded Defendants $8,624.42 in costs.
 
On November 21, 2023, the Court of Appeal issued a
Remittitur affirming the trial court’s rulings on Defendants’ demurrer and
motion for summary judgment. The Court of Appeal also determined that
Defendants are entitled to recover their costs on appeal.
 
On December 29, 2023, Defendants filed a memorandum of costs
on appeal.
 
On January 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to
strike or tax costs. On February 29, 2024, Defendants filed an opposition. On
March 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
In general, the prevailing party is entitled as a matter
of  right to recover costs for suit in
any action of proceeding. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. (CCP) § 1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th
599, 606; Scott Co. of Calif. v. Blount,
Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.) Allowable costs under CCP § 10335 must
be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, rather than merely
convenient or beneficial to its preparation, and must be reasonable in amount.
An item not specifically allowable under section 1033.5(a) nor prohibited under
subdivision (b) may nevertheless be recoverable in the discretion of the court
if they meet the above requirements (i.e., reasonably necessary and reasonable
in amount). (Ladas v. California State
Automotive Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-774.)
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Plaintiff makes the same arguments here as she did at the
prior motion to strike or tax costs in 2022. Plaintiff’s arguments fail for the
same reasons.
 
“Government Code section 12965, subdivision (b), governs cost
awards in FEHA actions, allowing trial courts discretion in awards of both
attorney fees and costs to prevailing FEHA parties.” Williams v. Chino Valley Independent Fire District (2015) 61
Cal.4th 97, 99.) Although Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b)
broadly mandates that costs be awarded to the prevailing party in civil
actions, our Supreme Court in Williams
made abundantly clear that Government Code section 12965(b) is an “express
exception to Code of Civil Procedure section 1032(b)” in actions governed by
FEHA. (Id. at p. 109.)
 
Here, the only interpretation of the record that the court
sees that could favor Plaintiff is that the appeal concerned her demurrer which
had the FEHA claims. However, as the Court of Appeal discussed, the FEHA claims
were defective on their face because they were brought well-after the one-year
statute of limitations ran and were therefore barred as a matter of law. The
remaining claims decided on summary judgment were not FEHA claims. Moreover, the
Court of Appeal expressly found that Williams
does not apply in this case, in affirming the trial court’s prior award of costs.
That finding appears to be the law of the case. Even if it was not, this Court
agrees with the Court of Appeal. Williams
simply does not apply. As such, this argument fails.[1]
 
Plaintiffs remaining arguments to tax costs or exercise
discretion to deny awarding costs also fail. Initially, Plaintiff challenged
all costs. As rightly pointed out by Defendant, the cost memorandum is prima
facie evidence that the costs—filing fees, preparation of clerk’s record on Plaintiff’s appeal—were incurred. As
such, it was incumbent on Plaintiff to bring forth evidence challenging the costs memorandum, not simply make argument.
It can hardly be disputed that an appeal was actually prosecuted by Plaintiff
and Defended by Defendant. (See Remittitur.) On reply, Plaintiff only
challenges Defendants’ fees for counsel’s pro hac vice appearance. (Reply 3:3-11.)
Plaintiff’s argument that this is merely convenient is not well taken.
Defendants’ counsel has been involved with this case since 2020. It is
reasonably necessary to have the counsel who is intimately familiar with the
case proceed to appeal. What is more, the challenged charge of $66.46 is hardly
cost prohibitive. As to Plaintiff’s financial condition, as with the prior
motion to tax costs, Plaintiff only cites to FEHA cases and/or comparable
federal employment discrimination cases to support her contention. The court is
not persuaded that these authorities apply. As such, these arguments also fail.
 
Accordingly, the court DENIES Plaintiff’s motion to
strike, or alternatively tax, costs.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.Motion to Strike, or
Alternatively Tax, Costs is DENIED.
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
