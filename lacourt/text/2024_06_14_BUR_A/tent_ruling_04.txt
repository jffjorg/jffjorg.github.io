ALLEGATIONS/HISTORY: 
 
Anthony Lavigne
(Plaintiff) brings this action against Avalon Bay Communities Inc. (Defendant)
in relation to an apartment Plaintiff rents from Defendant located at 10987
Bluffside Drive, Apartment 4116 Studio City, California. 91604 (Subject
Property). Plaintiff alleges a number of issues with the Subject Property that
render it uninhabitable. Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant continues to
collect rent for the Subject Property while refusing to remediate issues of
water intrusion, mold, and insect infestation. 
 
On February 23, 2024,
the Court granted Defendant’s Motions to Compel Further Responses to the
following discovery requests: 
 
·        
Form Interrogatory
No. 6.4.
 
·        
Special
Interrogatories Nos. 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 29, 32, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47,
50, 53, 56, 59, 62, 65, 68, 71, 74, 77, 80, 83, 86, 89, 92, 96, 102, 105, 108,
111, 114, 117, 120, 123, 126, and 129.
 
(See Feb. 23 Minute
Order) 
 
The Court ordered further
responses due within 30 days. (Id.) Additionally, the Court granted
sanctions payable to Defendant in the amount of $3,150. (Id.) 
 
Defendant now moves
for terminating sanctions based on Plaintiff’s refusal to comply with the
February 23 Order. Plaintiff has filed no opposition to this motion.  
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Where a party fails
to obey an order compelling answers to discovery, “the court may make those
orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction.” (C.C.P. §§ 2030.290(c),
2023.010(c); R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999) 75 Cal.
App. 4th 486, 495.) Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists
in disobeying the court’s orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 795-796.) 
 
A terminating
sanction is a “drastic measure which should be employed with caution.” (Deyo
supra, 84 Cal. App. 3d at 793.) “A decision to order terminating sanctions
should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a
history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not
produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in
imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem
(2005) 128 Cal. App. 4th 262, 279-280.) 
 
While the court has discretion
to impose terminating sanctions, these sanctions “should be appropriate to the
dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Deyo supra,
at 793.) “[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate sanction against a
litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with his discovery
obligations.” (Id.) 
 
Finally, A failure to oppose a motion may be deemed a consent to the granting of
the motion.  Failure to file an
opposition to the motion indicates the other parties' acquiescence that the
motion is meritorious. CRC Rule 8.54(c).
 
 
LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Defendant represents
to the Court that Plaintiff has not complied with the February 23, 2024 order compelling
further discovery responses. (Aslanyan Decl. ¶ 7.) Defendant states that
despite sending a courtesy copy of the Court’s order to Plaintiff, they
received no response by the March 26, 2024 deadline. (Aslanyan Decl. ¶¶ 5-7.)
Defendant argues that this failure to comply is evidence of willful behavior
befitting terminating sanctions. 
 
The Court finds that
Plaintiff’s refusal to comply with its Order is indicative of willful behavior.
“Lack of diligence may be deemed willful in the sense that the party understood
his obligation, had the ability to comply, and failed to comply.” (Deyo
supra, at 787.)  A period of almost four
months has passed from the initial Court order to the hearing of this motion.
In that time, Plaintiff did not comply with the Court’s Order. Nor did
Plaintiff seek to have the orders vacated pursuant to C.C.P. § 473(b) on
grounds of “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect” despite his
counsel representing that the failure to respond to discovery was the result of
a calendaring error. (See Aslanyan Decl. ¶ 11.) 
 
The question before
the Court thus becomes whether less severe sanctions than terminating sanctions
would produce compliance with the discovery rules. (Mileikowsky supra,
128 Cal.App.4th at pp. 279– 280.) The Court notes that Defendant make no
argument as to whether less sever sanctions would suffice. The Court can infer
from Defendants’ motion that they believe lesser sanctions to be insufficient,
but the reasons for this belief are not briefed. 
 
The Court finds that
lesser sanctions would be effective in curbing Plaintiff’s discovery abuses
such that terminating sanctions are not warranted. The Court agrees that monetary
sanctions have already proven unsuccessful in encouraging Plaintiff’s
production. Months have passed without production from Plaintiff, and he has
not indicated that any is forthcoming. However, other means of mitigation exist
prior to terminating sanctions. Here, the Court believes that evidentiary or
issue sanctions would result in Plaintiff complying with the Court’s orders. 
 
“The trial court may
order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse ‘after considering the
totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if the
actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of
formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.’” (Los Defensores,
Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390 (quoting Lang v. Hachman
(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246).) “Generally, '[a] decision to order
terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is
willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’” (Los
Defensores supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 390 [citation omitted].)  
 
In considering the
totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that Plaintiff has refused to
cooperate with the discovery process and violated the Court’s order for
compliance.   Monetary sanctions did not
cure his failures to comply, and had the Plaintiff made a modicum of effort to
comply with the ordered discovery the Court may have considered evidentiary
sanctions rather than terminating sanctions.  
However, the Plaintiff’s conduct of an intent to comply.  Rarely does this Court grant terminating
sanctions without a significant showing of willful noncompliance.  Defendant’s brief concerning this issue and
prior representations made to the Court cause the Court to conclude that they
are appropriate in this matter.  Plaintiff’s
conduct in this case has demonstrated a defiance of Court orders and a disregard
for the discovery process. As such, the case will be dismissed with prejudice
against Avalon Bay Communities, Inc.  
 
The Court notes that
another defendant, ASN Studio City Incorporated has yet to be served on the
case despite the case being filed on May 10, 2023.  The Court will address the OSC Re Proof of
Service at the hearing with Plaintiff’s counsel.
 
Sanctions 
 
Defendant appears to
request monetary sanctions in connection with the filing of this motion.
Defendant cites to no specific code section providing for such sanctions,
outside of reference to the general statutes for abuse of the discovery
process. (C.C.P. § 2023.030(a).) The Court notes that
sanctions for general abuse of the discovery process are entirely
discretionary. Given the Court has granted Defendant’s motion for terminating
sanctions, any further monetary sanctions would appear to the Court as improperly
punitive. (See Midwife v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal. App. 3d 57, 64
[“Discovery sanctions are not to be imposed for punishment, but instead are
used to encourage fair disclosure of discovery to prevent unfairness resulting
for the lack of information.’].) Accordingly,
Defendant’s request for further monetary sanctions is DENIED.
