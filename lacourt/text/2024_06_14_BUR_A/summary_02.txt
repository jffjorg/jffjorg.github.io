And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has sustained the demurrer to each cause of action on the grounds that they are barred by the PREP Act. The PREP Act creates a broad scheme of preemption of state law claims that arise out of, relate to, or result from the administration of a covered countermeasure. The court finds that each of the 14 causes of action alleged by the plaintiff relate to the administration of a covered countermeasure within the meaning of the PREP Act. The court does not see how any of the alleged causes of action do not arise out of, relate to, or result from Decedent's treatment for Covid-19.
