NOTICE:
 

The Court is not
requesting oral argument on this matter.  The Court is guided by
California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1308(a)(1) whereby notice of intent to appear
is requested.  Unless the Court directs argument in the Tentative Ruling,
no argument is requested and any party seeking argument should notify all other
parties and the court by 4:00 p.m. on the court day before the hearing of the
party’s intention to appear and argue.  The tentative ruling will become
the ruling of the court if no argument is received.   
 
Notice may be given
either by email at BurDeptA@LACourt.org or by telephone at (818) 260-8412.
 
ALLEGATIONS: 
 
Tomas Cruz (Plaintiff) brings this action
against Tuan Phi (Defendant) for claims
arising out of an alleged December 26, 2023 incident. Plaintiff alleges he was
hired to work on Defendant’s roof and that he was injured in so doing. Plaintiff
alleges it was Defendant’s negligence in maintaining the roof that caused
Plaintiff to fall. 
 
Defendant now moves to compel Plaintiff’s initial response
to his Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for the
Production of Documents (RFPD). Plaintiff also moves to deem matters in his Request
for Admissions (RFA) matters admitted. Plaintiff has filed no opposition to
these motions. 
 
Defendant also requests a total of $9,740 in sanctions be
granted in connection with the four motions. 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
I.                   
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
If a party
to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling response and for a monetary
sanction.  (C.C.P. § 2030.290(b).)  The statute contains no time
limit for a motion to compel where no responses have been served.  All
that need be shown in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was
properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired,
and that no response of any kind has been served.  (See Leach v.
Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
Where
there has been no timely response to a demand to produce documents, the
demanding party may seek an order compelling a response.  (C.C.P. §
2031.300(b).)  Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including
privilege and work product.  (C.C.P. § 2031.300 (a).)  Thus, unless
the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief from waiver, he or she
cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. There is no deadline for a
motion to compel responses.  Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving
party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing the
motion. 
 
If a party fails to respond
to requests for admission in a timely manner, the requesting party may move for
an order that the matters be deemed admitted. (C.C.P. § 2033.280(b).) The requesting party’s motion must be
granted by the court unless the party to whom the requests for admission have
been directed has served a proposed response to the requests for admission that
is in substantial compliance with C.C.P. § 2033.220 prior to the hearing. 
(C.C.P. § 2033.280(c).)  By failing
to timely respond, the party to whom the requests are directed waives any
objection to the requests, including one based on privilege or work
product.  (C.C.P. §
2033.280(a).) 
 
II.                
MERITS 
 
Request to Compel Responses

 
On January
29, 2024, Defendant propounded his Interrogatories, RFPD, and RFA on Plaintiff via
email to Plaintiff’s counsel. (Babaian Decl. ¶ 2, Exh. A.) Discovery responses
were due March 1, 2024, but Defendant received no responses. (Babaian Decl. ¶¶ 2,
3.) Defendant’s counsel states that they sent a meet and confer email inquiring
about discovery after the deadline but received no response.  (Babaian Decl. ¶ 3.) Subsequent meet and
confer attempts also went without response. (Babaian Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.) As of
the filing of this motion, Defendant has received no responses. (Babaian Decl.
¶ 6.) 
 
Based on
the foregoing, Defendant’s unopposed motions to compel initial response
to his Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and RFPD are GRANTED. 
 
Defendant’s
unopposed motion to deem RFA matters admitted is also GRANTED.
 
Sanctions

 
The Court may
impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct. (C.C.P. § 2023.030(a).) 
 
The Court shall
impose monetary sanctions for failure to timely respond to requests for
admission unless the party acted with substantial justification, or the
circumstances render imposition of sanctions unjust. (C.C.P. § 2033.280(c).) The Court must impose a monetary sanction
on the party or attorney whose failure to serve timely Requests for Admission
responses necessitated the motion. (Id.)
 
Further,
it is customary to grant sanctions where a party has filed a motion to compel,
and the other party fails to file an opposition. (C.R.C., Rule 3.1348(a).)  
 
Here,
Defendant has drafted and filed four motions while Plaintiff has rendered no
opposition. Accordingly, the Court awards sanctions in the amount of $2,615 as
against Plaintiff and his counsel jointly and severally. This amount reflects 5
hours of attorney work at a rate of $475 per hour, as well as the $60 filing
fee for each motion. (Babaian Decl. ¶ 7.)
