And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the Plaintiffs' motion to tax costs in part. The Defendant, Deputy Hurtado, is responsible for paying $2,607.52 in costs. The judge has also denied the Plaintiffs' request to tax 75% of the costs claimed by Deputy Hurtado, finding that the Plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claim.

The dispute centered on the validity of Deputy Hurtado's 998 Offer, which was made to settle the case for $15,000.00. The judge found that the offer was invalid because it was not apportioned and unconditional, and therefore Deputy Hurtado is not entitled to recover expert witness fees under Section 998.

The judge also disagreed with the Plaintiffs' argument that the costs of obtaining certified copies of Plaintiff Ebersole's conviction were unnecessary. The judge found that the costs were reasonably incurred and necessary for the litigation.

The judge denied the Plaintiffs' request to tax the remaining $16,404.60 in costs, finding that the Plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claim. The judge noted that the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary, and that the Plaintiffs failed to meet this burden.
