Background
 
On May 7, 2021, Shana
Anglin, Christopher Dean Ebersole, and minors Elijiah Makar and Rozlynn Makar
through their guardian ad litem Shana Anglin (collectively “Plaintiffs”) filed
a Complaint against Patrice Loraine Burton, Alex Villanueva in his official
capacity as Sheriff of Los Angeles County and Does 1 to 20. Doe 1 was named as
Sherrif’s Deputy Justin Meng, Doe 2 was named as Sherriff’s Deputy Derek
Clotworthy, and Doe 3 was named as Sheriff’s Deputy Jose Hurtado. 
 
The Complaint alleges
five causes of action:
 
(1) Violation of the Tom Bane Civil
Rights Act, against Defendant Burton and Does 7 and 8. 
(2) Violation of the Civil Rights Act
of 1871 against Defendant Burton and Does 1 through 5, 11 through 20.  
(3) Violation of the Civil Rights Act
of 1871 (42 U.S.C § 1983) against Defendant Alex Villanueva in his official
capacity and Does 9 and 10. 
(4) Violation of the Civil Rights Act
of 1871 (42 U.S.C § 1983) (Monell liability) against Defendant Butron
and Does 6 through 8. 
(5) Violation of Civ. Code § 789.3
against Defendant Burton and Does 6 through 8. 
 
Plaintiffs allegeD
that they resided in a 4-unit apartment complex (the “Complex”) located in
Carson, CA that was owned by Patrice Loraine Burton (“Burton”). (Compl.  ¶ 11.) The Plaintiffs were allowed to live in
a unit in the complex in exchange for taking care of the Complex, but Burton
changed her mind and decided to evict the Plaintiffs illegally, causing
Plaintiffs to become homeless. (Compl. ¶¶ 11, 17.) The Complaint alleges that
when Burton changed the locks on the Complex and did not allow Plaintiffs to
enter the Complex, Los Angeles Sheriff’s Deputies were called but they refused
to assist Plaintiffs. (Compl. ¶¶ 14, 15.) 
 
On
April 3, 2023, Deputies Hurtado, Meng, and Clotworthy and the County of Los
Angeles filed a Cross-Complaint against Burton for (1) Apportionment of Fault,
(2) Indemnification, and (3) Declaratory Relief. 
 
On July 16, 2021,
default was entered against Patrice Loraine Burton. Default judgment was
entered against Defendant Burton on July 29, 2024. 
 
The Court granted summary
judgment motions in favor of Sheriff Villanueva and Deputies Meg and Clotworthy.

 
The
case proceeded to trial against Deputy Hurtado on May 21, 2024.  On May 31, 2024, the jury found in favor of
Deputy Hurtado.  Judgment was entered in
favor of Deputy Hurtado. 
 
On
August 12, 2024, Deputy Hurtado (“Defendant”) filed a memorandum of costs,
seeking $21,910.22 in costs. Plaintiffs have filed a motion to tax costs. The
matter is now before the court. 
 
Motion to
tax costs
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
 CCP § 1033.5
sets forth the costs recoverable by the prevailing party. To recover a cost, it
must be reasonably necessary to the litigation and reasonable in amount. (Perko’s
Enterprises, Inc. v. RRNS Enterprises (l992) 4 Cal.App.4th 238, 244.)
" If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the
burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not
reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v. California State Automotive Assoc.
(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-74.) “On the other hand, if the items are
properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the
party claiming them as costs.” (Ibid.)¿ 
¿ 
The losing party may dispute any or all of the items in the
prevailing party’s memorandum of costs by a motion to strike or tax costs.
(CRC, rule 3.1700(b).) A motion to strike challenges the entire costs
memorandum, whereas a motion to tax challenges particular items or amounts.
 
II.        Discussion
Plaintiffs
move to tax $17,809.07 of the costs claimed by Deputy Hurtado. Plaintiffs seek
to strike the following: 
 
A.        Expert
Witness Fees
 
CCP
§ 1033.5(b)(1) states: 
 
(b) The following items
are not allowable as costs, except when expressly authorized by law:
    (1) Fees of experts not ordered by the
court.
 
Plaintiffs
maintain that Deputy Hurtado’s CCP § 998 Offer is unenforceable and expert
witness fees are discretionary under Section 998(c)(1). (Campbell Decl., Ex.
A.) If Deputy Hurtado’s 998 Offer is valid, Deputy Hurtado is entitled to
recover costs, “including expert witness fees, reasonably incurred[.]” (Covert
v. FCA USA, LLC (2022) 73 Cal.App.5th 821, 828.) Even if Defendant’s expert
witness did not testify at trial, the cost is recoverable. (See Evers v.
Cornelson (1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 310, 317-318.) 
 
Plaintiffs
assert that Deputy Hurtado’s 998 Offer was invalid because the offer was for
all four plaintiffs globally for $15,000.00 and was an unapportioned offer
contingent upon all the Plaintiffs accepting it. “[A]n offer to two or more
parties, which is contingent upon all parties’ acceptance, is not a valid offer
under the statute.” (Weinberg v. Safeco Ins. Co. of America (2004) 114
Cal.App.4th 1075, 1086.) Deputy Hurtado maintains that because
the Plaintiffs had a unity of interest such that there was a single
indivisible, injury because the injury stemmed from their forced eviction. “An
exception to the general rule that a single lump sum offer to multiple
plaintiffs is not a valid 998 offer exists where the plaintiffs have a unity of
interest such that there is a single, indivisible injury.” (Id., at p.
1087.) Therefore, the 998 Offer was valid. 
 
However,
the Weinberg Court found that “‘[i]t certainly can be expected that when
a husband or wife is injured in an uninsured motorist accident and the claim
for that accident is wrongfully denied by their insurer, both husband and wife
will incur expenses not necessarily limited to attorney fees, and that each may
suffer varying degrees of emotional distress[.]’” (Weinberg, supra,
114 Cal.App.4th at p. 1087.) Therefore, the husband and wife “did not have a
single, indivisible injury” and the defendant’s unapportioned joint 998 Offer
was invalid, and the defendant could not recover expert witness fees under
section 998. (Id., at p. 1087.) 

The record before the court supports the findings that there is no single,
indivisible injury between Plaintiffs because the emotional distress suffered
by each Plaintiff was different, as were the damages suffered given that this
action also concerned minor children. During trial, Plaintiffs Shana Anglin and
Christopher Ebersole testified that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they were
unable to find work or a stable place to live. (See 7/29/2024 Judgment Against
Defendant Patrice Loraine Burton at p. 3.) Plaintiff Anglin also testified that
she had miscarried at the time she was unlawfully evicted from her residence
and struggled to find housing after the unlawful eviction. (Id.) 
 
“As
the law presently stands, a single offer to more than one person must
generally be apportioned and unconditional.” (Peterson v. John Crane, Inc.
(2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 498, 512 [italics original].) Because Deputy Hurtado’s
998 Offer was not apportioned and unconditional, the 998 Offer is invalid and
Deputy Hurtado is not entitled to recover expert witness costs pursuant to
Section 998. 
 
Therefore,
$2,607.52 will be taxed from Defendant’s memorandum of costs. 
 
B.        Exhibit
Costs
 
“[A]  prevailing party is not entitled to recover costs
associated with preparing photocopies of exhibits and demonstratives under
section 1033.5(a)(13) if the items were not presented to the trier of fact.” (Segal
v. ASICS America Corp. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 651, 665.) However, the California
Supreme Court states that the costs of such exhibits “may be awarded in the
trial court's discretion[.]” (Id., at p. 665.)
 
Plaintiffs
seek to tax $1,605.15 for exhibit costs related to obtaining certified copies
of the convictions of Christoper Ebersole that were not offered as exhibits.  As the court could have taken judicial notice
of the court records, the certified copies were unnecessary. 
 
Deputy
Hurtado asserts that for the court to take judicial notice of Plaintiff
Ebersole’s conviction he needed to “furnish[] the court with sufficient
information to enable it to take judicial notice of the matter.” (Evid. Code, §
453.) For the conviction to be admissible, Evid. Code § 425.5(b)(1) required a
certified copy of the conviction. Judicial notice of the convictions permitted
the court to instruct the jury on the facts proved by the certified copies and
CACI No. 211 allowed the jury to consider the convictions regarding Plaintiff
Ebersole’s credibility. (Opposition, Ex. C, D.) 
 
The
court finds that the costs to obtain certified copies of Mr. Ebersole’s
conviction were reasonably incurred and necessary for the litigation. 
 
Furthermore,
while Plaintiffs object to the courier charges for obtaining the certified
copies, “base charges,” “research,” fuel charges, and “adv/wit ck” and “check
charges”, Plaintiffs fail to show that certified copies could have been
reasonably obtained without incurring such charges. Moreover, Plaintiffs failed
to show that Defendant paid a rush charge and that the rush charge was not
reasonably necessary. Therefore, the exhibit costs will not be taxed. 
 
C.        Deposition
Costs
 
Plaintiffs
move to tax $1,292.95 in deposition transcripts costs that had no bearing on
Jose Hurtado’s case, specifically the Deposition transcripts of Deputy Meng, Deputy
Chacon, Deputy Sam, Deputy Sanchez, and Deputy Faraimo. 
 
Plaintiffs
assert that because none of the above witnesses were involved on the day Deputy
Hurtado interacted with Plaintiffs, their depositions have no bearing on the
action and were not reasonably necessary to the litigation. 
 
Defendants
assert that under Section 1033.5(a)(3), deposition costs are allowable costs,
and Deputy Hurtado is entitled to those costs as the prevailing party. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1032(b).)
 
Moreover,
even if the deposition transcripts were not used a trial, they are recoverable.
(Seever v. Copley Press, Inc. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1557.)
Defendant Hurtado maintains that his counsel needed to defend the depositions
and assess “the level of the deputies’ involvement in the incidents of July 17
and 18, 2020, to determine whether they were important witnesses to the case
and to judge their demeanor in case they were called as rebuttal witnesses at
trial.” (Opposition, at p. 8:4-6.) Moreover, Deputies Clotworthy, Meng, and
Awad were listed as potential witnesses at the time of trial. 
 
Even
if Deputy Hurtado took the position that the Plaintiffs had already been
evicted the day they interacted with him, his preparation for trial required
the taking and reviewing the deposition transcripts. Therefore, the deposition
costs were reasonably incurred, and costs will not be taxed. 
 
D.        Request
to Tax the Remaining $16,404.60
 
Plaintiffs
maintain that the remaining $16,404.60 is not recoverable by the other
Defendants because they did not file a memorandum of costs within 15 days.
(CRC, rule 3.1700(a)(1).) Consequently, because three of the four defendants
forwent costs, $16,404.60 of the costs claimed by Deputy Hurtado should be
taxed in the amount of 75% or $12,303.45 because it would be unfair to saddle Plaintiffs
with the costs of three defendants who waived their right to seek costs. 
 
“Except
as otherwise expressly provided by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a
matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.” (CCP § 1032(b).)
Plaintiffs fail to show that 75% of the costs claimed in the memorandum of
costs were incurred by the other Defendants and not by Deputy Hurtado. “If the
items on a verified cost bill appear proper charges, they are prima facie
evidence that the costs, expenses and services therein listed were necessarily
incurred.” (Rappenecker v. Sea-Land Service, Inc. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d
256, 266.) 
 
“[A]
party's ‘mere statements in the points and authorities accompanying its notice
of motion to strike cost bill and the declaration of its counsel are
insufficient to rebut the prima facie showing [that the costs were necessarily
incurred].’ (Jones v. Dumrichob (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 126 citing Rappenecker
v. Sea-Land Service, Inc. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 256, 266.) Here, the burden
is on Plaintiffs to show that 75% of costs are improper.
Plaintiffs offer no evidence to support a 75% apportionment of costs. Most
importantly, Plaintiffs cites no case law permitting apportionment of costs
against a prevailing party when the co-Defendants have failed to file a
memorandum of costs. 
 
As
Plaintiffs fail to show that 75% of costs were not reasonably incurred by
Deputy Hurtado, the request to tax 75% of costs is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiffs’
motion to tax costs is granted in part. $2,607.52 will be taxed from Defendant’s
memorandum of costs.
