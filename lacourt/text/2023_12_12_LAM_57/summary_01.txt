And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge regarding a future court hearing in the case 22STCV24943. The plaintiff, Daryoush Sameyah, sued Rami Gishi and Keyes European, LLC for malicious prosecution. The complaint alleges that Gishi, who was an employee of Keyes, filed false criminal charges against Sameyah, which led to a criminal prosecution. The complaint also alleges that Gishi testified against Sameyah at his trial, and that the prosecution ended in a favorable outcome for Sameyah.

Previous to this hearing, the court had already granted Gishi's anti-SLAPP motion and struck Sameyah's complaint as to Gishi. Keyes had also filed a motion for leave to file its own anti-SLAPP motion, which was granted. Keyes' anti-SLAPP motion is now pending before the court.

The court determined that Gishi's communications with law enforcement authorities that led to the filing of criminal charges against Sameyah constituted speech protected by the anti-SLAPP statute, and that Sameyah failed to show a probability of prevailing on his malicious prosecution claim against Gishi. Based on these determinations, the court struck Sameyah's complaint as to Gishi.

The issue posed by Keyes' anti-SLAPP motion is whether Sameyah's complaint should also be stricken as to Keyes. The court determined that Keyes' liability stands or falls on Gishi's liability, and since the court determined that Gishi is not liable to Sameyah, then Keyes is not liable to Sameyah either. Therefore, the court is granting Keyes' anti-SLAPP motion and striking Sameyah's complaint as to Keyes.
