And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Defendant's motion to compel arbitration of the Plaintiff's claims. The Judge believes that the claims fall within the scope of the parties' arbitration agreement and that the Plaintiff's contention that the agreement is unconscionable is unfounded. The Judge also rejects the Plaintiff's claim that the Defendant's litigation conduct constitutes a waiver of its right to compel arbitration. As a result, the Court has stayed all proceedings pending the outcome of the arbitration.
