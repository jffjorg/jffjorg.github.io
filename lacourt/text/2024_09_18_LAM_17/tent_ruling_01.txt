 Case No.: 
  23STCV13848 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  September 18, 2024




 
 
Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions is GRANTED. Plaintiff,
who is representing herself in pro per, is sanctioned $350.00 for the
failure to comply with this Court’s 4/10/2024 order. 
 
On 6/15/2023, Plaintiff Assetan Sylla (Plaintiff) filed suit
against Superior Grocers (Defendant). On 8/23/2023, Plaintiff filed a first
amended complaint (FAC), alleging property damage, battery, and theft. 
 
            On 10/4/2023, Cross-Complainant
Super Center Concepts, Inc. dba Superior Grocers filed a cross-complaint
against Assetan Stylla, alleging: (1) negligence; and (2) conversion. 
 
            Now, Defendant moves for terminating
sanctions against Plaintiff. 
 
            The motion is unopposed.
 
Discussion

 
            Defendant argues that terminating
sanctions are warranted because Plaintiff has still failed to comply with this
Court’s 4/10/2024 order compelling Plaintiff’s responses to Defendant’s Special
Interrogatories, Requests for Production, and Form Interrogatories 4.1, 6.4,
12.6, and 17.1.
 
            Notably, Plaintiff failed to oppose
Defendant’s 4/10/2024 motions to compel, and has failed to oppose this motion
as well. 
 
            The Court takes Plaintiff’s
non-opposition to be a concession to the merits of Defendant’s motion. 
 
In sum, the Court concludes that Plaintiff is either unwilling or
unable to litigate this action. Terminating sanctions are therefore
appropriate. “[T]here is no question of the power of the court to apply the
ultimate sanction of default against a litigant who persists in an outright
refusal to comply with his discovery obligations.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne
(1978) 84 Cal. App. 3d 771, 787, superseded on other grounds, Guzman v.
General Motors Corp. (1984) 154 Cal. App. 3d 438, 445.) 
 
Based on the foregoing, Defendant’s motion for terminating
sanctions is granted. The Court also grants Defendant’s request for monetary
sanctions for failure to comply with the Court’s 4/10/2024 order in the amount
of $350.00. (CCP §§ 2030.290(c), 2031.300 (c).) 
 
It is so
ordered.
