```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff. The plaintiff, who is representing herself, has failed to comply with the court's order to respond to the defendant's discovery requests. The plaintiff has also failed to oppose the defendant's motion to compel and has failed to oppose the pending motion for terminating sanctions. The court has ordered the plaintiff to pay a sanction of $350.00 for her failure to comply with the court's order. The judge has also granted the defendant's request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $350.00. The court concludes that the plaintiff is either unwilling or unable to litigate the action and that terminating sanctions are therefore appropriate.
