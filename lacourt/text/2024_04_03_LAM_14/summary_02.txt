Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a legal malpractice case. The plaintiff, Akbarnejad, has brought a claim against the defendants, Safaie, Stuart, and Arya Law Center PC, alleging professional negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud. The defendants demurred to the complaint, arguing that it fails to state a cause of action and is uncertain. The judge has ruled that the demurrer to the first and second causes of action is overruled, but the demurrer to the third cause of action, fraud, is sustained. The judge has given the plaintiff 10 days to amend the complaint to plead a connection between Defendant Safaie and Defendant Arya. The judge has also granted the defendants' motion to strike the punitive damages and attorney's fees allegations from the complaint, giving the plaintiff 10 days to amend.
