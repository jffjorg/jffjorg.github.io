And here is the English-text summary:

This is the tentative ruling on the motion to quash the subpoena and limit discovery. The Plaintiff, Roe v. Cordoba, objects to the subpoena on the grounds of privacy and Civil Code § 1708.85, which allows a plaintiff in a civil proceeding for violation of that section to exclude their true name and other identifying characteristics from the court record. The Defendant, Madeline Isabel Cordoba, seeks to discover the Plaintiff's medical and sexual history, including any testing of the Plaintiff that resulted in a positive test result for HSV-2. The court rules that the subpoena does not violate either Civil Code § 1708.85 or the Plaintiff's right to privacy. The court also limits the discovery to the time period between and including February 1, 2022, and December 29, 2022.
