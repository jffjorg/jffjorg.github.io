Governing Statute
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure § 1987.1 provides in relevant part as follows:
 
(a) If a subpoena requires the
attendance of a witness or the production of books, documents, electronically
stored information, or other things before a court, or at the trial of an issue
therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon motion reasonably
made by any person described in subdivision (b), or upon the court's own motion
after giving counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard, may make an order
quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it
upon those terms or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective
orders. In addition, the court may make any other order as may be appropriate
to protect the person from unreasonable or oppressive demands, including
unreasonable violations of the right of privacy of the person.
(b) The following persons may make
a motion pursuant to subdivision (a):
(1) A party.
…”
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure § 1987.2 provides in relevant part:
 
“(a) …in making an order pursuant
to motion made under subdivision (c) of Section 1987 or under Section 1987.1,
the court may in its discretion award the amount of the reasonable expenses
incurred in making or opposing the motion, including reasonable attorney's
fees, if the court finds the motion was made or opposed in bad faith or without
substantial justification or that one or more of the requirements of the
subpoena was oppressive.”
 
Civil Code § 1708.85(f)(1)
provides that a Plaintiff in a civil proceeding for violation of that section
may exclude their true name and “other identifying characteristics” from the
court record. More specifically, Civil Code § 1708.85(f)(2)(C) directs
that all court orders “shall be worded so as to protect the name or other
identifying characteristics of the plaintiff from public revelation.”
 
Discussion
 
            On November
3, 2023, Defendant Cordoba served a subpoena that seeks (1) all “documents” and
“communications” regarding any testing of a particular patient that resulted in
a positive test result for HSV-2, and (2) all “documents” and “communications”
regarding any testing of that patient during the time period between February
1, 2022, and July 1, 2023. A copy of the subpoena was lodged with this court in
a sealed envelope, pursuant to this court’s order issued December 14, 2023.
 
            Plaintiff
objects to the subpoena on the ground that a person who reads the subpoena and
reads the record of this lawsuit could figure out that he is the patient
identified in the subpoena. He argues that this violates Civil Code
§ 1708.85(f). That argument was rejected by this court in its ruling
issued on October 16, 2023. Plaintiff made a motion for reconsideration of the
point on December 14, 2023, which was denied. Plaintiff filed a writ petition
with the Court of Appeal, which was denied on February 21, 2024. For the
reasons given in those prior rulings, and in the absence of other direction
from the Court of Appeal, that argument is rejected.
 
            Second
Plaintiff suggests that the subpoena violates scope limits set forth by the
California Supreme Court in John B. v. Superior Court (2006) 38 Cal.4th
1177.  In John B., the question
was whether a husband (the defendant) had infected his wife (the plaintiff)
with HIV, or vice versa. Id. at 1181. As proof of his position, the
husband had offered a negative HIV test performed on him six weeks before the
wife came up with a positive result. Id. The wife sought discovery of
the husband’s medical and sexual history for the past 10 years, which the trial
court granted. Id. at 1182. The California Supreme Court reversed,
giving plaintiff two options: she could either (a) accept the validity of the
negative test and confine her discovery to a period starting six months prior
to the negative test or (b) make an offer of proof regarding the accuracy or
reliability of the negative test. Id.
 
            In its
discussion, the Court advised trial judges to “measure the closeness of the fit
between the requested discovery and the allegations of the complaint.” John
B., supra, 38 Cal.4th at 1200. In this case, Plaintiff
has produced a negative test from Laboratory Corporation of America.
(Plaintiff’s Exhibit D). The record itself does not indicate precisely when the
test was undertaken, but the parties seem to agree it was on December 29, 2022.
Obviously, Defendant is entitled to investigate and independently confirm the
validity of a test that Plaintiff plans to introduce into evidence. 
 
As also explained in John B.,
supra, 38 Cal.4th at 1199, the party who places a contention
in issue cannot use his own privacy to prevent another party from investigating
this contention. And that is the apparent purpose of the subpoena at issue
here, which seeks to find out if there were any contradictory or confirming
tests from the same laboratory going back 10 months before the negative test
and forward six months after. This subpoena is not barred by John B.
 
Conclusion
 
            This
subpoena does not violate either Civil Code § 1708.85 or Plaintiff’s right
to privacy. Therefore, the motion to quash is DENIED. Defendant’s request for
sanctions is also DENIED.
 
(2)-(5)  Other
Subpoenas
 
            Plaintiff
now moves this court for orders quashing subpoenas addressed to non-parties
Midwest Express Clinic, Perry Crawford, Physicians Immediate Care – Chicago,
and Kerolos Tawfeek M.D. In opposition, Defendant Cordoba seeks sanctions of
$5,000 per motion.
 
Decision
 
            Defendant
Cordoba’s Objections to Exhibits A-C, E-G, J-K, M-N, P, and T are SUSTAINED.
The objections are otherwise OVERRULED.
 
            The motions
are GRANTED, in part. The subpoenas shall be limited to cover only the
time period between and including February 1, 2022 and December 29, 2022. No
sanctions are awarded.
 
Discussion
 
            On November
14, 2023, Defendant Cordoba served notice or a subpoena that seeks (1) all
“documents” and “communications” regarding any testing of a particular patient
that resulted in a positive test result for HSV-2, and (2) all “documents” and
“communications” regarding any testing of that patient during the time period
between February 1, 2022, and July 1, 2023. A copy of the subpoena was lodged
with this court in a sealed envelope, pursuant to this court’s order issued
December 14, 2023.
 
            Plaintiff
objects to this subpoena on three grounds: (1) that it violates Plaintiff’s
rights under Civil Code § 1708.85, (2) that it violates Plaintiff’s right
to privacy, and (3) that Defendant Cordoba failed to comply with the notice
provisions contained in Code of Civil Procedure § 1985.3. The first
argument the court has already addressed, as laid out above. The second and
third arguments are addressed in turn below.
 
            As also
explained above, John B. gives trial courts a rule of thumb in cases
like this one: until Defendant can show some reason to dispute a negative test,[2]
their right to discover medical and sexual history of the Plaintiff is limited
to a time period beginning six months before the negative test. Here, the test
is dated December 29, 2022. Therefore, following John B., Defendant would
be entitled to go back six months from that date, which would be June 29, 2022.
However, Plaintiff does not object to letting Defendant go back to February 1,
2022 (see e.g. Motion p. 13:9-11); his objection is to letting Defendant go
forward in time to the date of the negative test and beyond. But as already
explained, John B. permits discovery up to the date of the negative test.
 
            Counsel
must keep in mind that, as suggested by the Court in John B., this
temporal limitation may be expanded if Defense can produce some evidence that the
negative test is unreliable or inaccurate. It may also be expanded if some
other facts appear which take this case beyond the scope of John B. But
for now, it is appropriate to confine discovery to the foregoing parameters.
 
            Then there
is the issue of proper notice. Code of Civil Procedure § 1985.3(b)(2)
provides that a party who seeks personal records of any consumer, even if that
consumer is also a party, must give notice to counsel of record no less than 10
days prior to the date of production. That deadline is extended to 15 days if
the notice is given by mail. Code of Civil Procedure § 1013(a).
Separately, Code of Civil Procedure § 1985.3(b)(3) provides that the
notice must be served 5 days before the subpoena is served on the custodian of
the records. That deadline is extended to 10 days if the notice is given by
mail. Code of Civil Procedure § 1013(a).
 
            The
subpoenas have an issue date of November 2, 2023, and a production date of
December 11, 2023. They indicate that notice was given by mail on November 14,
2023. The subpoenas do not say when they were served on the custodians.
Defendant Cordoba therefore clearly complied with Subdivision 1985.3(b)(2). But
because there is no evidence of when the subpoenas were served on the
custodians, there is no evidence before the court which would enable it to
determine whether Defendant Cordoba complied with Subdivision 1985.3(b)(3).
 
            While Code
of Civil Procedure § 1985.3(c) obliges the party seeking the records to
provide the witness with proof that they properly served notice on the
consumer, it does not require that such proof be provided to the court. Since
Plaintiff is the moving party, he presumably bears the burden of proving that
Defendant Cordoba failed to comply. He has not done so.
 
Conclusion
 
             Because Plaintiff concedes that February 1,
2022 is within the relevant time period here, and John B. only halts
discovery of records created after the negative test, records from the time
period between and including February 1, 2022 and December 29, 2022 are
discoverable. Additionally, Plaintiff has failed to show non-compliance with
the service requirements set forth in Section 1985.3. Therefore, the motions
are GRANTED, in part. The subpoenas shall be limited to cover only the
time period between and including February 1, 2022 and December 29, 2022. No
sanctions are awarded.
