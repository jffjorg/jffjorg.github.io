ORDER CONTINUING
 THE HEARING ON PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME
 
Petitioner, Ernie R.
 Owens, Jr., filed this Petition for an Order for Change of Name to Everon
 Mansa Mari.  Petitioner is over
the age of 18. The court has considered the Criminal History Assessment filed
on January
 4, 2024, which does not reveal any substantial reason for denying the
petition. The petition, however, is incomplete. Petitioner must provide a place
of birth and a reason for the name change. (Items 7.b.(4) and 7.c.).
Additionally, the court’s file does not reflect that Petitioner has complied
with the requirements for publication of the Order to Show Cause. Code Civ.
Proc., § 1277.
Accordingly,
the court continues the hearing to March 1, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the
Compton Courthouse. Petitioner is ordered to provide a completed petition and
comply with publication requirements prior to the date of the hearing.
