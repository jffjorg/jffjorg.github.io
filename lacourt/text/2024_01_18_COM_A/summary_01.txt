And here is the English-text summary:

A tentative ruling has been issued by the court in the matter of Ernie R. Owens, Jr.'s petition to change his name to Everon Mansa Mari. The court has reviewed the petition and a criminal history assessment, which did not reveal any substantial reason for denying the petition. However, the petition is incomplete, missing a place of birth and reason for the name change. Additionally, the court's file does not reflect that the petitioner has complied with the requirements for publication of the Order to Show Cause. As a result, the court has continued the hearing to March 1, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse, and ordered the petitioner to provide a completed petition and comply with publication requirements prior to the hearing date.
