And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer to the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint is sustained without leave to amend. The Plaintiff, Jailyn Robateau, alleges claims for negligence and premises liability arising from the conditions of her work environment while working for Nationwide Guard Services (NGS). The Defendant argues that the claims are barred by the exclusivity provisions of the Worker's Compensation Act (WCA), as the Plaintiff has applied to the Worker's Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB) to adjudicate her claim. The Judge has found that the Plaintiff's injuries were suffered while working "on the clock" for NGS and that the claims are barred by the exclusivity provisions of the WCA. The Judge has also granted the Defendant's request for judicial notice of the Plaintiff's application to the WCAB.
