And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a preliminary ruling in a case involving unmanned aircraft. The defendants, AMA, Valley Flyers, and the City of Los Angeles, have successfully argued that the plaintiff, Daganas, assumed the risk of injury by operating the aircraft. As a result, the court has dismissed the causes of action against these defendants. The judge has also rejected Daganas' argument that the defendants' actions are preempted by federal law, which regulates unmanned aircraft. Specifically, the judge found that the FAA's regulation of unmanned aircraft does not apply to the plaintiff's actions because his plane never left the ground and did not pose a danger to the national airspace system. The judge's ruling is tentative and subject to change after further argument and evidence.
