[1] Because the causes of action against AMA, Valley
Flyers, and the City of Los Angeles are summarily dismissed based on the
defense of primary assumption of the risk, the Court need not address AMA and
Valley Flyer’s arguments concerning causation, or the Los Angeles’s argument
concerning governmental immunity.


[2] Daganas also argues that Alexander’s primary
assumption of the risk defense is preempted by federal law regulating unmanned
aircraft. (See 49 U.S.C. § 44809.) Specifically, section 44809, subdivision (e)
preempts state laws that would limit the authority of the Federal Aviation
Administration’s (FAA) ability to bring an action against a person “operating
any unmanned aircraft who endangers the safety of the national airspace
system.” The actions of Alexander do not fall into this category because his
plane never left the ground, thus failing to pose a danger to the national
airspace system. Any claim of implied preemption by Daganas would also fail
because separately, the FAA explicitly allows for “other remedies provided by
law.” (Id., § 40120, subd. (c).) Thus, Daganas does not meet his burden
under this theory.
