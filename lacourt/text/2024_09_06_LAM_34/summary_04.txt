Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by the defendants to the entire First Amended Complaint with 20 days leave to amend. The defendants argue that the causes of action in the complaint do not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The Judge agrees with the defendants, finding that the complaint fails to allege a duty owed by the defendants to the plaintiffs, and that the allegations of fraudulent concealment and constructive fraud are insufficient. The Judge also finds that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiffs will have 20 days to amend the complaint to address these issues.
