Defendants Terry
Alexander Burton and Delena Zimmerman’s Demurrer to the Complaint is OVERRULED.
Defendants are ordered to file an Answer within 10 days.
 
Background[1]  
 
23STCV30193
 
Plaintiff Lara Fishman (“Plaintiff
Fishman”) alleges the following:
 
Beginning on or about
November 23, 2022, Plaintiff Fishman signed a lease to rent a single living
unit located at 18125 Coastline Drive, Unit D, Malibu, CA 90265 (the single
living unit is herein referred to as “Unit” and the entire residential premises
located at 18125 Coastline Drive, Malibu, CA 90265 is herein referred to as
“PREMESIS”). On or about December 1, 2022, Plaintiff Fishman confronted
Defendant Michael Tenenbaum  (“M.
Tenenbaum”) that he did not properly prepare the remodeled UNIT for occupancy,
from the inception of the tenancy, and the Unit had not been permitted for the
extensive remodel. 
 
From the inception of
the tenancy, the Unit has not had properly maintained water pressure nor an
inoperable funicular.  From the inception
of the tenancy, the Unit has had many health hazards including a toxic sewage
gas leak, threat of asbestos from an exposed ceiling space, exposed electrical
wiring, broken window, unlockable door, and window. Although Defendants Michael
and Patricia Tenenbaum have known that the Unit has substandard living
conditions, they have actively concealed the existence of these facts from
Plaintiff Fishman, or made intentional fraudulent representations. Defendant M.
Tenenbaum has made numerous comments evidence his hostility toward women in
general and toward Plaintiff in particular based solely on her status as a
woman.
 
On December 7, 2024, Plaintiff
Fishman filed a Complaint, asserting causes of action against Defendant Michael
and Patricia Tenenbaum as trustees of The Elevator Trust date[d] November 22,
2021 (“Defendants”), and Does 1-100 for:
 
1.              
Violation of Business and Professions Code sec 17200 et
seq and 17500; 
2.              
Violation of Cal. Civil Code §789.3(b) and/or §1942.5; 
3.              
Breach of Contract;
4.              
Negligence;
5.              
Negligent Misrepresentation;
6.              
Fraud;
7.              
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; and
8.              
Violation of Fair Housing Act.

24STCV05884
 
Plaintiff Coastline
Asset Management, LLC (“Plaintiff Coastline”) alleges as follows:
 
Plaintiff is the assignee of the
Defendant Michael and Patricia Tenenbaum as trustees of The Elevator Trust
date[d] November 22, 2021 (“Landlord”). Defendant Lara Fishman (“Defendant
Fishman”) and Landlord entered into a Residential Lease Agreement on or about
November 24, 2022 (the “Lease”), for a one-year term starting on December 1,
2022, and ending on December 1, 2023. The Lease obligated Defendant Fishman to
pay rent in the amount $8,750 per month for each month of the Lease. Defendant
Fishman failed to pay rent from May 2023 through November 2023.
 
Demurrer in 23STCV30193
 
Legal Standard
 
A
demurrer may be made on the grounds that the pleading, inter alia, does
not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and/or is uncertain.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subds. (e) and (f).)
 
When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of
the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A
demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the
pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 [citations omitted].) At the pleading stage, a
plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant
of the factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) “[A] demurrer
does not, however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law
alleged in the pleading, or the construction placed on an instrument pleaded
therein, or facts impossible in law, or allegations contrary to facts of which
a court may take judicial knowledge.” (S.
Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 [citations
omitted].) 
 
Discussion 
 

Defendants demur, pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure § 430.10, subdivision (e), to the first, second and eighth
causes of action in Plaintiff Fishman’s Complaint, on the basis that they fail
to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action. 
 
First Cause of
Action 

 
Plaintiff’s
first cause of action alleges a violation of Business and Professions Code
section 17200. The elements required to state a cause of action for violation
of Business & Professions Code section 17200 are (1) a business practice,
(2) that is unfair, unlawful or fraudulent, and (3) an authorized remedy. (Bus.
and Prof. Code § 17200). When a plaintiff alleges a UCL action against a
defendant, the plaintiff must allege that an “injury in fact [or] lost money or
property as a result of [alleged] unfair competition” of defendant. (Schultz
v. Neovi Data Corp. (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 86, 92.) Here, Plaintiff Fishman
does not allege a violation of law, or that somehow she was induced into
entering into the lease with Defendants because of false advertising. Moreover,
there are no allegations that there were fraudulent business practices. 
 
Further, in order to have standing under the UCL, a private
plaintiff must allege that she “has
suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of the
unfair competition.” (Bus. & Prof. Code § 17204). Plaintiff Fishman has
failed to identify any money or property lost as a result of Defendants’
unlawful business practices.
 
The demurrer is
sustained.
 
Second Cause
of Action
 
The Second Cause of Action concerns two statutory
provisions. First, Section 789.3(b) of the Civil Code provides that “[] a
landlord shall not, with intent to terminate the occupancy under any lease or
other tenancy or estate at will, however created, of property used by a tenant
as his or her residence, willfully: (1) [p]revent the tenant from gaining
reasonable access to the property by changing the locks or using a bootlock or
by any other similar method or device; (2) [r]emove outside doors or windows;
or (3) [r]emove from the premises the tenant’s personal property, the
furnishings, or any other items without the prior written consent of the
tenant[.] . . . Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to prevent the
lawful eviction of a tenant by appropriate legal authorities, nor shall
anything in this subdivision apply to occupancies defined by subdivision (b) of
Section 1940.” Here, it is unclear what allegations concern this cause of
action. The court cannot find any allegations that Defendants “locked out”
Defendant Fishman, removed any doors or windows, or removed her property.
 
Additionally, Plaintiff Fishman also alleges a Civil Code
section 1942.5. Under this provision, 
“[i]f the lessor retaliates against the lessee because of the exercise
by the lessee of the lessee’s rights under this chapter or because of the
lessee’s complaint to an appropriate agency as to tenantability of a dwelling,
and if the lessee of a dwelling is not in default as to the payment of rent,”
then “the lessor may not recover possession of a dwelling in any action or
proceeding, cause the lessee to quit involuntarily, increase the rent, or
decrease any services within 180 days of” five specified events. (Cal. Civ.
Code § 1942.5(a).) Here, again, a review of the Complaint does not warrant this
cause of action.
 
To the extent that the court grants leave to amend, these
two statutory provisions should be separated out into two separate causes of action.
 
Eighth Cause of Action 
 
Under this cause of action, it appears that Plaintiff
Fishman seeks relief under the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California
Housing Discrimination Law. The Complaint is devoid of the specific provisions
of each law and the court cannot and will not speculate as to the specific
provisions that Plaintiff Fishman seeks to enforce.
 
The demurrer is sustained.

Legal Standard

23STCV30193
 
Discussion 
 
Defendant Fishman demurs, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure § 430.10, subdivision (e), to the second cause of action in Plaintiff
Coastline’s Complaint, on the basis that it fails to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action. Defendant Fishman also seeks to demurrer to the
first cause of action on the basis that the lease agreement was not attached to
the Complaint. 
 
First Cause of Action 
 
The court will
summarily overrule the demurrer as to the first cause of action. First, the
notice provision does not reflect the statutory basis for the demurrer of this
cause of action, However, more importantly, “[i]n an action based on a written
contract, a plaintiff may plead the legal effect of the contract rather than
the precise language.” (Construction Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG
Speciality Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198-99.)
 
Second Cause of
Action
 
“The essential allegations of an action for fraud are a
misrepresentation, knowledge of its falsity, intent to defraud, justifiable
reliance, and resulting damage.” (Roberts
v. Ball, Hunt, Hart, Brown & Baerwitz (1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 104, 109.) “The elements of negligent misrepresentation are (1) the misrepresentation
of a past or existing material fact, (2) without reasonable ground for believing it to be true, (3) with intent to
induce another's reliance on the fact misrepresented, (4) justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation, and (5) resulting damage.” (Apollo Capital
Fund, LLC v. Roth Capital Partners, LLC (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 226, 243.)
 
“Fraud must be pleaded with specificity…[t]o withstand a
demurrer, the facts constituting
every element of the fraud must be alleged with particularity, and the claim
cannot be salvaged by references to the general policy favoring the liberal
construction of pleadings.” (Goldrich v.
Natural Y Surgical Specialties, Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 772, 782
[emphasis in original].) “This particularity requirement necessitates pleading facts which show how, when, where, to
whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.” (Stansfield v. Starkey (1990) 220
Cal.App.3d 59, 73 (emphasis in original; internal quotations and citation
omitted].) Likewise, “[e]ach element in a cause of action for.
. . negligent misrepresentation must be factually and specifically alleged.” (Cadlo
v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. (2004) 125 C.A.4th 513, 519 [citation
omitted].)
 
Plaintiff Coastline
has failed to plead the aforesaid cause of action with the requisite
specificity.
 
The demurrer is
sustained.
