And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling denies Defendant Chris Ketcham's motion for an order specially setting the deposition fees of Plaintiffs' retained experts. The Court finds that Defendant did not provide proof of service to the experts whose rates are challenged, despite the Court's explicit order to do so. The Court also notes that Defendant's claim that serving the experts with notice of the hearing is sufficient to satisfy its statutory obligations is insufficient. As a result, Defendant's motion is denied.
