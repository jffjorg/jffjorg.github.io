considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
November 29, 2022, Plaintiff Matthew Adams (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Irene Kim, Richard Kim, and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle tort
and general negligence. 
On
January 17, 2023, Defendants Irene Kim and Richard Kim (“Defendants”) filed an
answer. 
On
March 6, 2023, the Court found that this case (22STCV37356) and case number
22STCV34043 are related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule
3.300(a). Case number 22STCV34043 became the lead case. 
On
November 29, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be
relieved as counsel. 
On
April 11, 2024, Defendants filed a motion for terminating sanctions and
monetary sanctions, to be heard on May 24, 2024.  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for December 6, 2024. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Defendants
ask the Court to grant terminating and monetary sanctions against Plaintiff. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Monetary, issue, evidentiary, and terminating
sanctions 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 provides in part: 
“To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any
particular discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court,
after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity
for hearing, may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in
conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process: 
“(a) The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. The court may
also impose this sanction on one unsuccessfully asserting that another has
engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or on any attorney who advised
that assertion, or on both. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision
of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
“(b) The court may impose an
issue sanction ordering that designated facts shall be taken as established in
the action in accordance with the claim of the party adversely affected by the
misuse of the discovery process. The court may also impose an issue sanction by
an order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process
from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses. 
“(c) The
court may impose an evidence sanction by an order prohibiting any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from introducing designated
matters in evidence. 
“(d) The court may impose a terminating sanction by
one of the following orders: 
“(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of
the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process. 
“(2) An order staying further proceedings by that
party until an order for discovery is obeyed. 
“(3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of
the action, of that party. 
“(4) An order rendering a judgment by default against
that party. 
“(e) The court may impose a contempt sanction by an
order treating the misuse of the discovery process as a contempt of court. 
“(f) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), or any other
section of this title, absent exceptional circumstances, the court shall not
impose sanctions on a party or any attorney of a party for failure to provide
electronically stored information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or
overwritten as the result of the routine, good faith operation of an electronic
information system. 
“(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter
any obligation to preserve discoverable information. 
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030.)         

B.   Sanctions for failure to comply with Court order to attend
deposition 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (h),
provides in part: 
“If [a] party or party-affiliated deponent . . . fails
to obey an order compelling attendance, testimony, and production [at a
deposition], the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against that party
deponent or against the party with whom the deponent is affiliated. In lieu of,
or in addition to, this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against that deponent or against
the party with whom that party deponent is affiliated, and in favor of any
party who, in person or by attorney, attended in the expectation that the
deponent’s testimony would be taken pursuant to that order." 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (h).) 
C.   Sanctions for failure to comply with discovery orders 
A
violation of a discovery order supports the imposition of terminating
sanctions. (Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th
1611, 1620.) Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in
disobeying the court's orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d
771, 795-796 (Deyo).) 
A
terminating sanction is a "drastic measure which should be employed with
caution." (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "A
decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a
violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows
that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.) 
DISCUSSION 
On
January 8, 2024, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to compel Plaintiff to
attend his deposition and ordered Plaintiff to appear for a deposition on
January 15, 2024 at 2:00 p.m. or at another date and time to which the parties
agreed but no later than 30 days after January 8, 2024. The Court also imposed
monetary sanctions on Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff
did not comply with the Court’s January 8, 2024 order.  On January 15, 2024, Defendants’ counsel took
a certificate of non-appearance when Plaintiff did not appear for his
deposition. 
On
March 5, 2024, the Court ordered Plaintiff to appear for a deposition within 30
days and imposed $410.00 in monetary sanctions on Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff
did not comply with the Court’s March 5, 2024 order.  Based on Plaintiff's failure to comply with the Court's January 8 and March 5, 2024 orders, the Court finds that a sanction less severe than
terminating sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery
rules.  Therefore, the Court grants
Defendants’ motion for terminating sanctions. 
Defendants
request $585.00 in monetary sanctions based on three hours of attorney time at
a rate of $175.00 per hour and one $60.00 filing fee.  Counsel spent one drafting the motion and
anticipated spending one hour to reply to any opposition and one hour to attend
the hearing on the motion.  The Court
awards sanctions of $410.00 based on two hours of attorney time and one filing
fee. 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court GRANTS the motion for terminating sanctions filed
by Defendants
Irene
Kim and Richard Kim and dismisses Plaintiff
Matthew Adams’ complaint with prejudice under Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030,
subdivision (d)(3). 
          The Court GRANTS the request for sanctions of Defendants Irene Kim and Richard Kim and orders Plaintiff
Matthew Adams to pay Defendants Irene Kim and Richard Kim $410.00 by June 24,
2024. 
          Moving parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
          Moving parties are ordered to file the proof of service of
