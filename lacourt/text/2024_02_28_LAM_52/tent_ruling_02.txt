 Case Number:  24STCP00339    Hearing Date:   February 28, 2024    Dept:  52 Petitioner StratCap Investments,
Inc.’s First Amended Petition for Approval of Transfer of Structured Settlement
Payment Rights 
Petitioner StratCap Investments, Inc., a Delaware
corporation, petitions for approval of transfer of structured settlement rights
by payee Lesly Contreras.  
Petitioner currently lacks the power to bring such a
petition.  Revenue and Taxation Code section 23301 provides that
“the exercise of the powers, rights and privileges of a foreign taxpayer in
this state may be forfeited” if it fails to pay “any tax, penalty, or interest
... that is due and payable” to the Franchise Tax Board.  “[A] corporation suspended for nonpayment of
taxes is disabled from resort to the courts for any purpose.”  (Palm Valley Homeowners Ass’n, Inc. v. Design
MTC (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 553, 560; accord Cal-Western Business
Services, Inc. v. Corning Capital Group (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 304,
310.) 
Petitioner StratCap Investments, Inc.
forfeited its rights to act in California. 
The court takes judicial notice of the records of the Secretary of State
as facts not reasonably subject to dispute and capable of immediate and
accurate determination by resort to the Secretary of State’s website. 
(Evid. Code, § 452(h).)  The
Franchise Tax Board’s actions concerning petitioner are also subject to
judicial notice as “[o]fficial acts” of
an executive department of this state.  (Evid. Code, § 452(c).)  The Secretary of State’s website states
StratCap Investments, Inc.’s status is “Forfeited – FTB,” with an “inactive
date” of November 2, 2009.  Petitioner lost
the right to petition California’s courts over 14 years ago.    
Petitioner StratCap Investments, Inc.’s petition for approval of transfer
of structured settlement rights is denied.
