And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the petition of StratCap Investments, Inc. for approval of the transfer of structured settlement payment rights by payee Lesly Contreras. The Judge found that StratCap Investments, Inc. forfeited its rights to act in California over 14 years ago, making it impossible for the company to bring the petition. The Judge took judicial notice of the records of the Secretary of State and the Franchise Tax Board, which showed that StratCap Investments, Inc.'s status is "Forfeited – FTB" with an "inactive date" of November 2, 2009. The Judge cited California law and case precedents to support the decision, stating that a corporation suspended for non-payment of taxes is disabled from resorting to the courts for any purpose.
