And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Dignity Community Care, has moved for a determination of good faith settlement in the amount of $29,999. The plaintiff, George Smith, opposes the motion. The court has reviewed the evidence presented and finds that Dignity has not provided sufficient evidence to approximate George Smith's total recovery or to demonstrate its proportionate liability. Therefore, the court lacks a sufficient basis to determine that the settlement was in good faith. The motion is denied without prejudice.
