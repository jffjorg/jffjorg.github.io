(“FAC”) for (1) Fraud, (2) Violation of Business and Professions Codes 6106,
(3) Violation of Business and Professions Code 12700 [sic], (4) Defamation,

            On April
24, 2024, Defendants Stacey Friedman and The Law Offices of Robert Shiri, APC
(collectively, “Moving Parties”) demurred to the FAC. On May 31, 2024,
Plaintiff opposed the demurrer. On June 6, 2024, Moving Parties replied.
 
            No trial
date has yet been set.
 
(1)  
Demurrer
 
Moving Parties demur to the first
through eleventh causes of action in the FAC for failure to state a cause of
action.
 
Decision
 
.            The
demurrer to the first through eleventh causes of action is SUSTAINED without
leave to amend
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1113, subd. (f)
 
            The
court notes that the memorandum of points and authorities submitted in support
of the demurrer is more than ten pages but fails to include a table of contents
and a table of authorities per rule 3.1113, subdivision (f), of the California
Rules of Court. Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1113, subd. (f). The court
will still consider the demurrer but admonishes Defendants Kim and Regents to
comply with the requirements of the California Rules of Court going forward.
 
Requests for Judicial Notice
 
            The court DENIES Moving Parties’ and Plaintiff’s requests for
judicial notice, as the court does not rely on any of those documents in
reaching its decision herein.
 
Litigation Privilege
 
            “’The usual formulation is that the privilege applies to any
communication (1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants
or other participants authorized
by law; (3) to achieve the objects
of the litigation; and (4) that have some connection
or logical relation
to the action.’ [Citation.]” People ex rel. Gallegos v. Pac. Lumber Co. (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 950, 958.)
 
            The court agrees with Moving Parties that Plaintiff’s claims
against them are barred by the litigation privilege. All of the allegations
against the Moving Parties in the FAC derive entirely from communications
allegedly made during the prior small claims court proceeding. FAC, ¶¶ 17-25.
The alleged communications of the Moving Parties were clearly made in a
judicial proceeding, were made to achieve the objects of that litigation, and
those alleged communications form the entire basis of Plaintiff’s claims
against Moving Parties. See Id. 
 
Moreover, whether Moving Parties
actually represented Defendant Humberto Gonzalez in the prior small claims
court proceeding is irrelevant, as the court looks only to the allegations of
the FAC on a demurrer or matters subject to judicial notice, and does not
determine the truth of disputed facts. Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d
584, 605. Also, even if something is subject to judicial notice, the court does
not necessarily take notice of the factual matters asserted therein. Dominguez
v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.
 
In addition to being barred by the
litigation privilege, Plaintiff’s claims fail to allege facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action for the reasons set forth below.
 
First Cause of Action: Fraud
 
To state a cause of action for
intentional misrepresentation, the plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating,
“(1) a misrepresentation, (2) knowledge of falsity, (3) intent to induce
reliance, (4) actual and justifiable reliance, and (5) resulting damage.
[Citation.]” (Aton Ctr., Inc. v. United Healthcare Ins. Co. (2023) 93
Cal.App.5th 1214, 1245.) “In California, fraud must be pled specifically;
general and conclusory allegations do not suffice. [Citations.] ‘Thus ‘ “the
policy of liberal construction of the pleadings ... will not ordinarily be
invoked to sustain a pleading defective in any material respect.’ ‘ [Citation.]
[¶] This particularity requirement necessitates pleading facts which show how,
when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.’
[Citation.] A plaintiff's burden in asserting a fraud claim against a corporate
employer is even greater. In such a case, the plaintiff must ‘allege the names
of the persons who made the allegedly fraudulent representations, their authority
to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or
written.’ [Citation.]” (Lazar v. Superior Ct. (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645
(Lazar).
 
            The FAC contains no allegations indicating that Plaintiff
relied on any misrepresentations by Moving Parties or that Plaintiff was
damaged because of such alleged misrepresentations. FAC, ¶¶ 17-25. The FAC
alleges that Moving Parties made the statements to the court, not to Plaintiff.
Id. Plaintiff’s fraud claim therefore fails.
 
Second Cause of Action: Violation of Business and
Professions Code 6106
 
The commission of any act
involving moral turpitude, dishonesty or corruption, whether the act is
committed in the course of his relations as an attorney or otherwise, and
whether the act is a felony or misdemeanor or not, constitutes a cause for
disbarment or suspension.
 
If the act constitutes a felony or
misdemeanor, conviction thereof in a criminal proceeding is not a condition
precedent to disbarment or suspension from practice therefor.
 
(Bus. & Prof. Code, § 6106.)
 
            The court agrees with Moving Parties that this code provision does
not provide a private cause of action, and therefore the FAC fails to state a
cause of action here.
 
Third Cause of Action: Violation
of Business and Professions Code 17200
 
“As used in this chapter, unfair
competition shall mean and include any
unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or
practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising and any act
prohibited by Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 17500) of Part 3 of Division 7
of the Business and Professions Code.” Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200. “The
UCL prohibits any unfair, unlawful, or fraudulent business act or practice.
[Citation.] Only the first two types of practices are at issue here. A practice
is unlawful under the UCL where it violates a predicate law.” (CADC/RADC
Venture 2011-1 LLC v. Bradley (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 775, 792-793.) “An
‘unlawful’ business practice or act within the meaning of the UCL ‘is an act or
practice, committed pursuant to business activity, that is at the same time forbidden by law. [Citation.]” Bernardo v. Planned Parenthood Fed'n of Am. (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 322, 351 (Bernardo), italics
in original.
 
The court finds the FAC fails to
state a cause of action for unfair competition. Although not mentioned in the
moving papers, the Court notes that statements made during a court proceeding
do not constitute a business practice for purposes of unfair competition law or
unfair business practices. See Bernardo, supra, 115 Cal.App.4th at p.
351. The court also finds the allegations in the FAC regarding this cause of
action as it pertains to Moving Parties to be conclusory and unsupported by any
factual allegations. FAC, ¶¶ 56-64; Wexler v. California Fair Plan
Ass'n (2021) 63 CA5th 55, 70 [court may disregard conclusory
allegations].
 
Fourth Cause of Action: Defamation
 
            “The elements of a defamation claim are (1) a publication
that is (2) false, (3) defamatory, (4) unprivileged, and (5) has a natural
tendency to injure
or causes special
damage.” J-M Mfg. Co. v. Phillips &
Cohen LLP (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 87, 97.
 
            As noted above, the litigation privilege applies to Plaintiff’s
allegations against Moving Parties since the alleged statements were made
during a court proceeding. The FAC does not contain any allegations indicating
that Moving Parties’ statements made during the small claims court proceeding
were unprivileged. FAC, ¶¶ 17-25, 73-78.
 
Fifth Cause of Action: False Light
 
            “’False light is a species of invasion
of privacy, based
on publicity that places a plaintiff
before the public in a false light
that would be highly offensive to a reasonable person,
and where the defendant knew or
acted in reckless
disregard as to the falsity of the publicized
matter and the false light in which the plaintiff would
be placed.’ [Citation.]” Jackson v. Mayweather (2017) 10 Cal.App.5th
1240, 1264.
 
            This cause of action fails for the same reasons as Plaintiff’s
defamation claim.
 
Sixth Cause of Action: Harassment
 
            “’Harassment’ is unlawful violence, a credible threat of violence,
or a knowing and willful course of conduct directed at a specific person that
seriously alarms, annoys, or harasses the person, and that serves no legitimate
purpose.” Code Civ. Proc., § 527.6, subd. (b)(3).
 
            The FAC does not contain allegations that Moving Parties engaged in
unlawful violence, made a credible threat of violence, or knowingly engaged in
conduct intended to alarm, annoy, or harass Plaintiff, and that it served no
legitimate purpose. See FAC, ¶¶ 17-25, 100-111. The FAC also does not contain
any allegations that Moving Parties were Plaintiff’s landlord or had any
involvement with Plaintiff’s housing. See Id.; Civ. Code, § 1940.2,
subd. (d).
 
Seventh Cause of Action:
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress and Negligent Infliction of
Emotional Distress
 
            To state a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional
distress, the plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating, “(1) defendant engaged
in extreme and outrageous conduct (conduct so extreme as to exceed all bounds
of decency in a civilized community) with the intent to cause, or with reckless
disregard to the probability of causing, emotional distress; and (2) as a
result, plaintiff suffered extreme or severe emotional distress.” (Berry v.
Frazier (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 1258, 1273.) “‘[The] negligent causing of
emotional distress is not an independent tort but the tort of negligence
....’[Citation.] ‘The traditional elements of duty, breach of duty, causation,
and damages apply.” McMahon v. Craig (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 1502, 1509.
 
            The FAC fails to allege facts to state a cause of action for
intentional infliction of emotional distress or negligent infliction of
emotional distress. The FAC contains no allegations indicating that Moving
Parties owed Plaintiff a duty of care. FAC, ¶¶ 17-25, 112-117. Also, as noted
above, Moving Parties’ alleged conduct occurred solely within the small claims
trial court proceeding, which would render it subject to the litigation
privilege. See S.A. v. Maiden (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 27, 44 [“[A]s many
cases have concluded, the litigation privilege under Civil Code section 47,
subdivision (b), bars IIED claims arising out of litigation conduct.”])
 
Eighth Cause of Action: Elder
Abuse
            “’Abuse of an elder
or a dependent adult’ means any of the following: (1) Physical abuse, neglect,
abandonment, isolation, abduction, or other treatment with resulting physical
harm or pain or mental suffering. (2) The deprivation by a care custodian of
goods or services that are necessary to avoid physical harm or mental
suffering.” Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.07, subd. (a)(1). Neglect
refers to a custodian’s failure to attend to the basic needs and comforts of
the elder. See Delaney v. Baker (1999) 20 Cal.4th 23, 34.
            The FAC contains no
allegations that Moving Parties engaged in physical abuse, neglect,
abandonment, isolation, abduction, or other treatment resulting in physical
harm or mental suffering to Plaintiff, that they were a care custodian of goods
and services to Plaintiff necessary to avoid physical harm or mental suffering,
or that they owed her some kind of duty for purposes of elder abuse. See FAC,
¶¶ 17-25, 118-125.
Ninth Cause of Action: Breach of Covid-19 Rent Relief Assistance Program
Known as 80/20 Program
            The Covid-19 Tenant Relief
Act applies to landlord/tenant relationships. See Code Civ. Proc., §
1179.01 et seq. The FAC fails to allege any facts demonstrating a
landlord/tenant relationship between Plaintiff and Moving Parties. See FAC, ¶¶
17-25, 126-135.
Tenth Cause of Action: Retaliation
            Landlords may be held
liable for retaliating against tenants’ exercise of their rights in certain
scenarios under Civil Code section 1942.5. Civ. Code, § 1942.5, subd.
(a). The FAC does not allege the existence of a landlord-tenant relationship
between Plaintiffs and moving parties. See FAC, ¶¶ 17-25, 136-149.
Eleventh Cause of Action: Intrusion of Solitude
            “The
elements of a common law invasion of privacy claim are intrusion into a private
place, conversation, or matter, in a manner highly offensive to a reasonable
person.” Mezger v. Bick (2021) 66 Cal.App.5th 76, 86.
While the court agrees with Moving Parties that
“intrusion of solitude” is not a cause of action, invasion of privacy is a
cause of action. The court looks to the allegations, not the label of the cause
of action. “The label attached to a complaint, or a cause of action does not
control. [Citation.]” City of Glendale v. Marcus Cable Assocs., LLC (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1378. 
Either way, the court finds that the FAC does not
allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action for invasion of privacy
against Moving Parties. The FAC contains no allegations indicating that Moving
Parties intruded into a place, conversation, or matter involving Plaintiff in a
highly offensive manner. See FAC, ¶¶ 17-25, 150-165. The only allegations in
the FAC indicating any interactions between Plaintiff and Moving Parties were
in the small claims court proceeding, which is definitely not a private place
or a place where anyone would expect privacy. See Id.
Twelfth Cause of Action: Public
Disclosure of Private Facts
 
            For the sake of clarity, the court notes that Moving Parties did
not demur to the twelfth cause of action for public disclosure of private
facts.
 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the court
SUSTAINS the demurrer to the first through Eleventh Causes of Action without
leave to amend, subject to an offer of proof at the hearing on the demurrer.
