 Case Number:  24STCP00607    Hearing Date:   June 13, 2024    Dept:  14 #12Case Background
 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants
illegally accessed his email and social media accounts.
 
            On February
27, 2024, Plaintiff William Wade filed the Complaint for (1) Invasion of
Privacy, (2) Civil Harassment in Violation of Code of Civil Procedure section
527.6, (3) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, (4) Negligent
Infliction of Emotional Distress, and (5) Declaratory and Injunctive Relief
against Does 1 through 20 (collectively, “Defendants”). No Doe amendments have
been filed and no Defendants have appeared yet.
 
            On May 2,
2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for limited-expedited discovery. On June 5,
2024, non-party Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”) filed an opposition.
Plaintiff did not file a reply.
 
            No trial
date is set.
 
Instant Motion 
 
Plaintiff now moves this court for leave to engage in limited and
expedited discovery against Microsoft.
 
Decision
 
            The motion is GRANTED. Plaintiff may
serve or conduct discovery against Microsoft to obtain necessary information,
but only to the extent necessary to identify and locate the Doe Defendants.
 
Governing
Standard
 
“Subject
to Sections 2025.270 and 2025.610, an oral
deposition may be taken as follows:… (b) The plaintiff may serve a deposition
notice without leave of court on any date that is 20 days after the service of
the summons on, or appearance by, any defendant. On motion with or without
notice, the court, for good cause shown, may grant to a plaintiff leave to
serve a deposition notice on an earlier date.” Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.210, subd. (b). This 20-day hold applies also to subpoenas for production
of business records. California Shellfish Inc. v. United Shellfish Co.
(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 16, 20-23. The deposition methods available against a
party are also available against non-parties. Code Civ. Proc., §
2020.010.
 
Preliminary Issue
 
            The court
notes that Microsoft served its opposition on June 5, 2024, well after the May
31, 2024 deadline. See Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b). The court will still
consider Microsoft’s opposition, but admonishes Microsoft to comply with the
requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure going forward. See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300,
subd. (d); Juarez v. Wash Depot Holdings, Inc. (2018) 24
Cal.App.5th 1197, 1202.
 
Discussion 
 
            A plaintiff
may serve a deposition notice before the expiration of the 20-day hold set
forth in subdivision (b) of section 2025.210 of the Code of Civil Procedure upon
a showing of good cause. Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.210, subd. (b). “[G]ood
cause which must be shown should be such that will satisfy an impartial
tribunal that the request may be granted without abuse of the inherent rights
of the adversary.” Greyhound Corp. v. Superior Ct. In & For
Merced Cnty. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 355, 388, superseded
by statute on other grounds in Coito v. Superior Court (2012) 54 Cal.4th
480.
 
            The
court finds Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause for obtaining leave to serve
discovery on Microsoft before the expiration of the 20-day hold in subdivision
(b) of section 2025.210 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It is clear that
Plaintiff needs information to identify and locate the Doe Defendants in this
action and that Microsoft has at least some of this information. Compl., ¶¶
3-19; Microsoft Opp., 3:9-17. The court further notes that Microsoft’s
opposition is more of a limited opposition, as it only seeks to require
Plaintiff to comply with the proper procedures for obtaining the requested
discovery. Microsoft Opp., 5:4-5.
 
            Based on the foregoing, the court GRANTS the motion, but only to
the extent necessary for Plaintiff to identify
and locate the Doe Defendants. To the extent Plaintiff seeks an order from the
court compelling Microsoft to comply with the previously served subpoena, the
court declines to grant any relief.
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is GRANTED. Plaintiff may serve or
conduct discovery against Microsoft to obtain necessary information, but only
to the extent necessary to identify and locate the Doe Defendants.
