And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Special Interrogatories, Set One. The plaintiff failed to provide any responses to the discovery requests, despite multiple extensions of time granted by the defendant's counsel. As a result, the plaintiff is ordered to serve the defendant with verified, objection-free responses to the interrogatories within 20 days. The judge has also ordered the plaintiff and their counsel to pay $760.00 in sanctions to the defendant's counsel within 20 days. The judge notes that the plaintiff's total failure to comply with their discovery obligations warrants the imposition of sanctions. Additionally, the judge has ordered the defendant to pay an additional $60.00 filing fee to cover the costs of the hearing.
