And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Gary Y. Tanaka in the case of Theodore G. Schwartz v. Claudette Spinelli Schwartz. The case involves allegations of elder abuse, neglect, and abandonment, as well as claims of physical and financial harm. The court has ruled on several motions, including a demurrer to the complaint, a motion to strike portions of the complaint, a motion to compel the defendant's deposition, and a motion for a protective order.

The court has overruled the demurrer to the first cause of action for elder abuse, finding that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to state a claim. The court has also denied the motion to strike portions of the complaint, finding that the allegations are relevant and not improper.

The court has granted the motion to compel the defendant's deposition, finding that the defendant has failed to appear for her properly noticed deposition. The court has also denied the defendant's motion for a protective order, finding that the defendant has not shown good cause for the delay and has not demonstrated that she will be subjected to unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression. However, the court has granted one condition of the protective order, allowing the defendant to appear remotely without the plaintiff's presence or visibility.

The court has ordered the defendant to appear for her deposition at a date, time, and location to be determined by agreement between the parties. If no agreement can be reached, the defendant is ordered to appear at a reasonable date, time, and location to be determined by the plaintiff.
