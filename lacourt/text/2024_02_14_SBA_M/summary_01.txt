And here is the English-text summary:

Judge Gary Y. Tanaka has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Nestor Hernandez, et al. v. Fouad I. Ghaly, et al., granting the plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. The plaintiffs seek to add a cause of action for intentional concealment and to state a claim for punitive damages. The court finds that the plaintiffs have adequately complied with the requirements for amending a pleading and that the proposed amendment is necessary and proper. The court also finds that the plaintiffs' delay in seeking leave to amend has not prejudiced the defendant. The plaintiffs are ordered to file and serve the proposed First Amended Complaint within five days of the date of the ruling, and to give notice of this ruling.
