Plaintiff Maria Rivero
(“Plaintiff”) sues Defendants County of Los Angeles (“LA County”), Nancy Canosa

On April 07, 2023, Plaintiff Maria
Rivero filed a Complaint against Defendants County of Los Angeles (“LA
County”), Nancy Canosa (“Canosa”), and Does 1 to 10 (collectively
“Defendants”). 
On June 12, 2023, Defendants
demurred to the Complaint’s sixteen causes of action based on the sufficiency
of the pleading. 
That same day, Defendants moved to
strike portions of the Complaint related to punitive damages. 
On October 9, 2023, the Court
sustained Defendants’ Demurrer to the Complaint in part, mooted the motion to
strike, and granted Plaintiff twenty (20) days leave to amend her Complaint. 
On October 30, 2023, Plaintiff
filed the operative complaint against the Defendants, alleging fifteen (15)
causes of action. 
Defendants collectively filed their
Answer to the FAC on January 02, 2024. 
Plaintiff filed two motions to compel further responses and
production of documents (CRS #4768, filed 3/26/24) and a motion to compel
further responses to special interrogatories (CRS #3793, filed 3/28/24 [in
addition to a prior motion to compel special interrogatories, CRS #7838, filed 2/21/24].)
Both motions requested monetary sanctions of $1650. On June 17, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a “notice of withdrawal of motion to compel further responses to
Defendant’s supplemental responses to special interrogatories nos. 2-5”
relevant to CRS#3793, but stated that Plaintiff was not withdrawing “her
separate motion to compel further responses to Defendant’s initial responses to
Plaintiff’s first set of special interrogatories, nos. 6-8 (of which only No. 7
actually remains in issue.) A subsequent notice of withdrawal filed on July 8,
2024 indicated that the previously filed motion to compel further special
interrogatory responses (CRS#7838) was now being withdrawn. As stated therein,
the only motion that continued to be pending was the motion to compel further
responses to requests for production of documents. 
Defendants opposed the remaining motion on July 16, 2024. No reply
has been filed as of July 25.
 
Motion to Compel Further Production
Timeliness 
A motion to compel further discovery responses must be
filed and served within 45 days after the initial verified response or
supplemental verified response was personally served or by any specific later
date that the discovering party agreed to in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.300, subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (c), 2033.290, subd. (c) [Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants, supra,
at p. 403].) Extra time is added to the 45 days if the response was served by a
method other than personal delivery. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1010.6, subd.
(a)(3)(B), 1013, subds. (c), (e), 2016.050.) Here,
the motion is timely.
 
Meet and Confer 
A motion to compel further production must be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Code of Civil Procedure section
2016.040. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) A meet and confer
declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the
motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.) Here, the parties
met and conferred and conducted an IDC.
 
Separate Statement 
A motion to compel further responses to interrogatories,
demands to produce, or RFAs must be accompanied by a separate statement unless
(1) no response has been provided to the discovery request or (2) the court has
allowed the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request
and each response in dispute in place of the separate statement. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345, subd. (a)(1); see Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd.
(b)(2), 2031.310, subd. (b)(3), 2033.290, subd. (b)(2).) Here,
such a separate statement was filed.
 
Legal Standard 
A motion to compel a further response is used when a party
gives unsatisfactory answers or makes untenable objections to interrogatories,
demands to produce, or requests for admission. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (a); Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403.) 
To request further production, a movant must establish: (1)
good cause for the production (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1); Sinaiko,
supra, at p. 403); and (2) that a further response is needed because (a)
the responding party’s statement of compliance with the demand to produce is
incomplete Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(1)), (b) the responding
party’s representation that it is unable to comply is inadequate, incomplete,
or evasive (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(2)), (c) the responding
party’s objection in the response is without merit or is too general (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(3); Catalina Island Yacht Club v. Superior
Court (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1127), or (d) if the responding party
objected to the production of ESI on the ground that it is not reasonably
accessible the movant can show that the (i) ESI is reasonably accessible or
(ii) there is good cause for production of the ESI regardless of its
accessibility (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (e)). 
 
Order Compelling Further Production:  
Plaintiff seeks further production of the following:
·       
Requests 7-10, seeking documents
reflecting that any other employee complained that plaintiff was treated
unfairly based on her protected classes of age, ancestry, disability or medical
leave. 
·       
Requests 11 and 2, seeking
any investigation documents into complaints that plaintiff was treated unfairly
on the above grounds.
·       
Request 13, seeking
documents relating to any complaint by any other employee that certain
individuals Nancy Canosa or Geanie Chough had engaged in discrimination or
harassment on the same protected grounds.
 
 Defendant County of Los Angeles opposes the requests, arguing
that certain terms in the requests are vague, such as “any assertion, concern
or complaint,” “unfair criticism,” “insensitive or offensive language.” The
County argues there is no limitation as to time and Plaintiff only began
working for Ms. Canosa in 2017. The County also argues that the requested
information is privileged and protective by the deliberative process doctrine,
the official information privilege, settlement privilege and mediation
privileges, and that the requested information would violate the privacy rights
of third parties. Finally, the County argues that Plaintiff’s citations to
cases involving the admissibility of “me too” evidence at trial is not
applicable to whether a plaintiff can seek discovery of such evidence.
The Court GRANTS the motion, in part, as modified.
First, however, the Court agrees with the Defendant that the requests
should be limited in time. Documents from the beginning of Plaintiff’s
employment are remote and do not relate to the decisionmakers alleged to have
engaged in discriminatory conduct here. It appears in the motion that Plaintiff
is limiting the requests to the past four years. (Mot., p. 10:26-27.) Accordingly,
the Court will limit the timeframe to January 1, 2020 to the present. 
Second, if the County has documents that it contends are covered by
the attorney/client, work product, settlement or mediation privileges, there is
an easy and well established fix written into the statute: it must provide a
privilege log so that Plaintiff can ascertain whether there is a basis to
challenge the assertions. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240, subd. (c).)
The remaining objections, however, are not well taken. 
First, the Court sees no terms that are excessively vague that they
cannot be responded to.
Second, so-called “me too” evidence of complaints by other employees has
been held to be relevant and admissible in discrimination and harassment cases.
(Meeks v. Autozone, Inc. (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 855, 871; Pantoja v.
Anton (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 87, 129; Johnson v. United  Cerebral Palsy/Spastic Children’s Foundation (2009)
173 Cal.App.4th 740, 767.) If evidence is potentially relevant and admissible
at trial, then it is by definition discoverable, as the scope of discovery in California
is broad. “[A]ny party may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not
privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending
action . . . if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010; see also Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Superior
Court (1970) 2 Cal.3d 161 [“An appellate court cannot reverse a trial court’s
grant of discovery under a ‘relevancy’ attack unless it concludes that the
answer sought by a given line of questioning cannot as a reasonable possibility
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence or be helpful for preparation for
trial.”].)
Third, the privacy rights of the potential third parties who complained
that either Plaintiff had been discriminated against or that they had, are
outweighed by the relevance of such information to this action, as well as the
fact that the information can be protected by a routine protective order
limiting the use of the information to this lawsuit. (Puerto v. Superior
Court (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1259.) The parties have already entered
into, and the Court has signed, a stipulated protective order, as of March 18,
2024. This same order will apply to all the additional discovery provided
regarding third parties in this order.
Finally, as to the deliberative process doctrine and the official
information privilege, the County includes a single page in the opposition (at pp.
5-6) regarding this argument, citing a single case, N.L.R.B. v. Sears, Roebuck
(1974) 421 U.S. 132. Without pin cite, the Court concludes that the County means
to reference what has been called the deliberative process privilege, which is
called in that decision the “executive privilege,” in the context of the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The case further discusses the fact that the
same privilege often overlaps with the attorney work product privilege: “It is equally
clear that Congress had the attorney’s work-product privilege specifically in
mind when it adopted Exemption 5.” (Id. at p. 154.) An additional
Exemption 7 to the FOIA was discussed dealing with investigatory records
compiled for law enforcement purposes. (Id. at p. 164.) Of course, that
is a federal law not at issue here, nor are any of the alleged investigations
in this case law enforcement related. Without a pin cite, the Court does not
see the relevance of this decision to the instant case, in which the Court has
already held that matters which are attorney work product may be withheld
subject to a privilege log. 
The
County also quotes from California Evidence Code section 1040. However, the
County does not discuss whether and how that code section applies to the
evidence sought here. Under that statute, the County has the burden to show either
that disclosure is forbidden by an Act of Congress or a statute of this state,
or that disclosure is against the public interest because there is a necessity
for preserving the confidentiality of the information that outweighs the
necessity for disclosure in the interest of justice.” (Id., subd. (b).) The
County has not done that. Accordingly, the County has not met its burden of showing
that either the deliberative process privilege or Evidence Code section 1040
apply here to prevent the disclosure. (See Labor & Workforce Development
Agency v. Superior Court (2018) 19 Cal.App.5th 12, 25 [party resisting
disclosure bears burden of proving that exemption from disclosure under the
California Public Records Act applies].)
Order Denying Sanctions:  
Except in certain circumstances involving electronic stored
information, the court must impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (h).)
Here, the Court finds that several of the arguments made by the County
were not supported. However, the objection on behalf of third parties was not
frivolous, and the Coutt does not find it unreasonable in this context for the
County to oppose on behalf of those third parties, rather than voluntarily
providing such third-party discovery. Accordingly, on this sole ground, the
Court will not order sanctions because the circumstances render the imposition
of sanctions unjust. 
Conclusion
            The Court GRANTS Plantiff’s motion
in part, limiting the production to January 1, 2020 to the present, subject to
a privilege log, and with third party documents subject to a protective order.
The Court DENIES the Plaintiff’s request for sanctions. The Court orders further
responses to be served on plaintiff within 15 court days.
