The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in a motion to confirm an arbitration award and enter judgment. The motion hearing has been continued to February 12, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 55. However, the Plaintiff (Petitioner) has failed to provide notice of the continuance, as ordered by the Court on October 2, 2023. The Judge is requiring the Petitioner to provide proof of service of notice of the continuance. The Court intends to reach the merits of the motion at the continued hearing date, assuming the Petitioner provides the necessary notice. The ruling references a precedent case, Monarch Healthcare v. Sup. Ct. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1282, 1286, which highlights the importance of due-process principles, including notice and an opportunity to be heard.
