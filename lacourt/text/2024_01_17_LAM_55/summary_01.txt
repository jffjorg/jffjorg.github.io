```

And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion to set aside the default and default judgment against him. The default was entered on March 1, 2023, after the defendant failed to comply with discovery orders and opposed a motion for terminating sanctions. The defendant argues that his attorney, Saunders, abandoned him at the critical time of the hearing, and that this abandonment excuses his failure to oppose the motion and comply with discovery orders.

The court finds that the defendant has shown that Saunders engaged in positive misconduct by abandoning him, and that this abandonment constitutes an extrinsic mistake. The defendant has also demonstrated a meritorious defense to the case, and has shown diligence in seeking relief once he discovered the default judgment.

The court grants the motion to set aside the default and default judgment, and denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions under CCP § 128.7. The court will schedule a status conference to ensure that the defendant complies with outstanding discovery requests and pays monetary sanctions.
