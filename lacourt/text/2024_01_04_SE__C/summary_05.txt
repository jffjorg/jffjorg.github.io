And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's ex parte application to advance its motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Vernonco LLC, argued that it needed to file the motion earlier due to the upcoming trial date, but the court found that the plaintiff could have filed the motion before stipulating to the trial date. The plaintiff did not make an affirmative showing of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or other statutory basis for granting ex parte relief, and therefore the court denied the application.
