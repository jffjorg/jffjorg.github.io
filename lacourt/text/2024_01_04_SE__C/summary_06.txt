Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to depose the plaintiff for more than 7 hours, but only partially. The defendants need an additional 7 hours to question the plaintiff due to the complexity of the case, numerous breaks taken, and significant delays caused by the Mandarin-language translator. The judge finds that the 7 hours allowed by law is insufficient in this case. However, the judge does not find that the defendants have established a need for 10 additional hours of deposition time. The judge also orders the plaintiff and her counsel to pay the defendants and their counsel $3,000 in sanctions for their refusal to engage in meaningful meet and confer discussions.
