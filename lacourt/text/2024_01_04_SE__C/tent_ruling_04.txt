Moving Party to give notice. 
 
Motion to Compel Responses to Interrogatories and Request for Production
of Documents 
 
If a party to whom interrogatories and document demands are directed
fails to respond at all, the propounding party’s remedy is to seek a court
order compelling answers thereto. (CCP §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) All that needs
to be shown is that the discovery was properly served on the opposing party,
that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been
served. The moving party is not required to show a reasonable and good faith
attempt to resolve the matter informally before filing this motion. A motion to
compel initial discovery responses need not show good cause, meeting and
conferring, or timely filing, and need not be accompanied by a separate
statement. (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) The failure to timely respond
also waives all objections. 
 
Here, Plaintiff  has shown that Form
Interrogatories (set one), Special Interrogatories (set one), and Request for
Production of Documents (set one) were served on May 26, 2023. 
 
In Opposition, Defendant indicates that Responses were (untimely) served
on October 19, 2023. 
 
The Motion is DENIED as MOOT. 
Sanctions
may be awarded against a party who fails to oppose a motion to compel, or
opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided
after the motion was filed. (C.R.C 3.1348(a).). Reasonable sanctions are
awarded as indicated below:
Given
the fact that the responses were untimely served, the Court finds that
reasonable sanctions are warranted in favor of the Moving Party. Defendant EDIS
RAMIREZ and his counsel of record are ORDERED to pay Plaintiff and their
counsel of record reasonable sanctions in the total amount of $1,184.95 ($250 x
4 hrs.) ($61.65 x 3) no later than 90 days from the Court’s issuance of this
Order. This date may be extended per agreement of the parties.
Motion to Deem Admitted 
 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a
timely response, the following rules apply: (a) The party to whom the requests
for admission are directed waives any objection to the requests…. The Court, on
motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both
of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently
served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210,
2033.220, and 2033.230. (2) the party’s failure to serve a timely response was
the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect…. (c) The court shall
make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7…on the party or attorney, or both, whose
failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.” (CCP §2033.280.)  No prior
attempt to resolve the matter informally is required. 
 
Here, RFAs were propounded by the Moving Party on May 26, 2023. In
Opposition, Defendant indicates that untimely responses were served on October
19, 2023. The Motion is rendered MOOT. 
Sanctions are
mandatory pursuant to the terms of CCP §2033.280(c).  Reasonable sanctions are awarded in favor of
the Moving Party. Defendant EDIS RAMIREZ and his counsel of record are ORDERED
to pay Plaintiff and their counsel of record reasonable sanctions in the total
amount of $311.65 ($250 x 1 hrs.) ($61.65 x 1) no later than 90 days from the
Court’s issuance of this Order. This date may be extended per agreement of the
parties.
