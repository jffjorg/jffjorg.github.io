Cross-Defendants
Request for Judicial Notice is GRANTED as to the existence of the document, but
not as to any hearsay statements contained therein. (Cal. Ev. Code §452.) 
 
This collections
action was filed by Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant NATIONAL COMMERICAL RECOVERY,
INC. (“Cross-Defendant”) on July 26, 2022. On September 15, 2022, a First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”) was filed. 
 
On February 24,
2023, the subject Cross-Complaint (“XC”) was filed by
Defendants/Cross-Complainants L.A. GRAND CLOTHING INC.; SSS APPAREL INC.;
GUILBERT TEX, INC.; SM CLOTHING INC.; and SIAMIAK OKHOVAT, individually and as
trustee of The Okhovat Revocable Family Trust, Dated May 12, 2004 (collectively
‘Cross-Complainants’). 
 
The Cross-Complaint
alleges the following relevant facts: “The claims brought by [Cross-Defendant]
in this action were assigned to it by J. Label, Inc.” (XC ¶6.) “In the FAC,
[Cross-Defendant] alleges that Cross-Complainants, operating under the name
‘Angel Kiss’, purchased and obtained wholesale fabric from NCR’s assignor, J
Label, and are thus indebted to J Label in the net amount of $215,357.89.” (XC
¶12.) “Cross-Complainants have never operated under the name ‘Angel Kiss. [¶]
Cross-Complainants have never purchased fabric, or any other good or service,
from J Label.” (XC ¶¶14-15.) “Cross-Complainants… allege, that Kim and PVE…
purchased and obtained from J Label the wholesale fabrics referenced in the
FAC.” (XC ¶17.) Cross-Complainants allege that that Kim and PVE, solely, are
responsible for the amounts alleged to be due and owing to NCR and J Label from
‘Angel Kiss’ in the FAC.” (XC ¶18.) 
 
The XC asserts one
sole cause of action for Declaratory Relief. 
 
Cross-Defendants
HWAN KIM and PVE EK LLC (collectively “Cross-Defendants”) argue that they were
not involved in the subject transactions and have no personal knowledge of any
facts relevant to a determination of liabilities between J. Label on the one
hand, and Cross-Complainants L.A. Grand Clothing, Inc., SSS Apparel, Inc. and
Okhovat on the other.  
 
There are two
essential elements for declaratory relief: “(1) a proper subject of declaratory
relief, and (2) an actual controversy involving justiciable questions relating
to [plaintiff’s] rights or obligations.” (Brownfield v. Daniel Freeman
Marina Hospital (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 405, 410.) 
 
Declaratory relief
is a broad remedy, and the rule that a pleading is to be liberally construed is
particularly applicable to a claim for declaratory relief. (See City of
Tiburon v. Northwestern Pac. R.R. Co. (1970) 4 Cal.App.3d 160, 170.)
 
The Demurrer is
OVERRULED. 
 
Here, the XC
sufficiently alleges the following facts: “Kim and PVE… operated under the name
‘Angel Kiss.’” (XC ¶16.) “Cross-Complainants allege that Kim and PVE, solely,
are responsible for the amounts alleged to be due and owing to NCR and J Label
from ‘Angel Kiss’ in the FAC.” (XC ¶18.) 
 
The Court finds the XC
adequately alleges that an actual and immediate controversy exists between the
parties regarding their rights and duties with respect to each other for
purposes of surviving demurrer. The arguments raised in the instant demurrer
raise factual determinations inappropriately resolved at this stage in the
litigation.
