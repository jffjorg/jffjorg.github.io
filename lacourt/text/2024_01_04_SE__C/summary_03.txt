Here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Demurrer filed by Cross-Defendants HWAN KIM and PVE EK LLC is OVERRULED. The Cross-Complaint alleges that Kim and PVE operated under the name 'Angel Kiss' and are responsible for the amounts alleged to be due and owing to NCR and J Label from 'Angel Kiss' in the First Amended Complaint. The Judge finds that the Cross-Complaint adequately alleges the existence of an actual and immediate controversy between the parties regarding their rights and duties, and that the Demurrer raises factual determinations inappropriately resolved at this stage in the litigation. The Judge grants the Request for Judicial Notice as to the existence of the document, but not as to any hearsay statements contained therein.
