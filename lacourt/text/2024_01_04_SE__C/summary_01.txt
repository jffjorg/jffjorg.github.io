	- "A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures." (Khoury v. Maly's of Calif. Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
	- "To recover on an alter ego theory of liability, a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to 'show a unity of interest and ownership, and inequitable result from treatment of the corporation as the sole actor.'" (Leek v. Cooper (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 399, 415.)
