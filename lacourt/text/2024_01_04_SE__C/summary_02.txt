The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of NATIONAL COMMERCIAL RECOVERY, INC. v. NAVPEAK INC., Case No. 22NWCV00352. The Judge granted the motion of Defendant KENNETH REDDING to set aside the default and default judgment. The Judge found that the service of summons and complaint on Redding was defective and did not take place, and therefore, the default judgment is void. The Judge also granted Redding's motion to quash the service of summons, finding that the substituted service was not delivered to Redding's abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address. The Judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) sections 415.20, 415(b), 473(d), 473(b), and 473.5, as well as California Evidence Code section 452 and the case of Dill v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994).
