 Case Number:  24VECV01446    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2025    Dept:  T 24VECV01446
Blowitz v Cislowski
Tentative ruling:  Motion for
trial setting preference.  The court
would otherwise grant the motion but does not understand why defendant Doe 3,
The Beaumont Company, has not been served. 
If plaintiff is concerned about getting to trial because of his age and
health, not serving this defendant seems to be inconsistent with this
goal.  The court will discuss at the
hearing.  Plaintiff’s counsel required to
show good cause why this defendant has not been served in the last 4 months.
