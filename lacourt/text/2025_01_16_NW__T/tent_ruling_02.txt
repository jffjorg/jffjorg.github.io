 Case Number:  23VECV01435    Hearing Date:   January 16, 2025    Dept:  T YEPEZ V
GARG 23VECV01435
Tentative ruling:  Defendant Garg’s
motion for summary judgment: Deny.  There
are multiple triable issues of fact concerning negligence and causation.  The declaration of plaintiff’s expert, Bruce
Dubin, M.D., a board certified plastic and reconstructive surgery specialist,
establishes that there are triable issues of fact as to whether Dr. Garg
violated the standard of care and whether that violation caused plaintiff’s injuries.  The objections to Dr. Dubin’s declaration,
which follow the same format as the defense expert’s declaration, are overruled.
