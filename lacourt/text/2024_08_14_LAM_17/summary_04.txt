Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent the defendant from frustrating the judgment entered in favor of the plaintiff. The plaintiff had previously submitted evidence that the defendant has been attempting to transfer the subject property to a third party, and that the defendant has failed to provide a copy of the alleged "trust" or a document signed seeking to transfer the subject property. The court finds that the plaintiff has shown that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its claims, and that it will suffer irreparable harm if the defendant is allowed to continue with the transfer. The court also finds that the plaintiff's entitlement to an injunction outweighs any harm to the opposing parties.

The preliminary injunction orders the defendant and third party not to execute any document that will transfer or otherwise hypothecate the defendant's rights, title, and interest in the subject property to the third party or any other person or entity. The court notes that the defendant did not oppose the motion, and therefore is considered to have conceded to the motion on the merits.
