Discussion
 
I.                  
Motion to
Compel Deposition: Randolph
 
On June 25,
2024, Randolph was served electronically with the Notice of Deposition (Exhibit
A) at jacob@jacobfights.com; complex@jacobfights.com; and
armando@jacobfights.com;. The Notice obligated Randolph to appear for
deposition on July 18, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. via remote videoconference. Randolph
never served an objection to the Notice.
 
On July 16,
2024, two days before the deposition, Randolph was sent an email requesting
confirmation of attendance at her deposition on July 18, 2024 (Exhibit B). On
July 17, 2024, Randolph was sent a second email containing the login
instructions and the link for attending the remote videoconference deposition
(Exhibit C). Randolph did not respond to either email. 
 
Randolph did
not appear for her properly noticed deposition, and Defendant's counsel had no
choice but to take a Certificate of No-Appearance.
 
California
courts of appeal have long held that "a litigant has the right to take a
proper deposition, and to receive responsive answers to proper questions…for
the purposes of discovery or for use as evidence, or for both purposes.” (Beverly
Hills Nat. Bank & Trust Co. v. Superior Court In and For Los Angeles County
(1961) 195 Cal.App.2d 861, 864-65, citing I. E. S. Corp. v. Superior Court
of Los Angeles County (1955) 44 Cal.2d 559.)
 
CCP section
2025.450(a) provides: 
 
If, after
service of a deposition notice, a party to the action…, without having served a
valid objection under Section 2025.410 [regarding defects in deposition
notice], fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it…the party
giving the notice may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance
and testimony[.]
 
            Here,
Randolph did not attend her properly noticed deposition set for July 18, 2024,
and counsel for Defendant was never served with a written notice objecting to
the Notice. As such, Defendant’s motion is granted. 
 
            Randolph
is sanctioned, jointly and severally with counsel, $1,343.91, the full amount
requested by Defendant minus the estimated fees for reviewing and responding to
Randolph’s opposition (the motion is unopposed). 
 
II. Motion
to Compel: Hairston 
 
            On
June 25, 2024, Hairston was served electronically with the Notice of Deposition
(Exhibit A) at jacob@jacobfights.com; complex@jacobfights.com; and
armando@jacobfights.com. The Notice obligated Hairston to appear for deposition
on July 18, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. via remote videoconference. Hairston never
served an objection to the Notice.
 
On July 16,
2024, two days before the deposition, Hairston was sent an email requesting
confirmation of attendance at his deposition on July 18, 2024 (Exhibit B). On
July 17, 2024, Hairston was sent a second email containing the login
instructions and the link for attending the remote videoconference deposition
(Exhibit C). Hairston did not respond to either email. 
 
Hairston did
not appear for his properly noticed deposition, and Defendant's counsel had no
choice but to take a Certificate of No-Appearance.
