And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for a stay of proceedings in this case. The defendant, Solar Service Experts, LLC, had argued that a stay was warranted because it had filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas against the plaintiff, Collection Solutions Software, Inc., concerning the same facts and circumstances at issue in this action. The plaintiff had opposed the stay, arguing that the defendant's filing in Texas was not a "claim" because it only had one cause of action for declaratory relief.

The judge found that a stay was prudent because the pendency of another earlier action growing out of the same transaction and between the same parties is a ground for abatement of the second action. The judge also noted that the parties' forum selection clause provides that the jurisdiction and venue for disputes arising under the agreement shall be determined by the court in Texas, and that the outcome of the motion to dismiss in Texas will determine which jurisdiction/venue is proper for this dispute.

The judge concluded that the stay would be brief, as a ruling is forthcoming in the Texas case, and that priority should be given to the court that first assumed jurisdiction over the case. The judge also noted that the parties' agreement provides that exclusive jurisdiction and venue for claims brought by the defendant against the plaintiff shall be in the state or federal courts situated in the State of Texas, County of Harris, and in no other court or jurisdiction.
