Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion to quash service of Summons and Complaint filed by Defendant Bernardo Moretti. The motion was filed on June 11, 2024, after Plaintiff Grand Promenade filed an unlawful detainer action against the Defendant on May 9, 2024. The Defendant claims that he was not personally served with the Summons and Complaint, but rather found a packet containing the documents outside his property on June 1, 2024. However, the Plaintiff argues that service was proper under Code of Civil Procedure section 415.45, which allows service by post and mail if the party to be served cannot be served in any other manner. The Plaintiff attempted to serve the Defendant several times without success and then moved for an Order to Post (OTP) to request permission to serve by post and mail. The Court granted the OTP and the Plaintiff effectuated service on June 3, 2024. The Judge finds that the Defendant's motion is insufficient to overcome the presumption of proper service given the Plaintiff's evidence of service in compliance with the code section. Therefore, the motion to quash is denied.
