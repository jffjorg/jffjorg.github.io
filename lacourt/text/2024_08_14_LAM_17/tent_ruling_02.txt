MUHAMMAD AFRIDI 
  
        
  vs.
 
AMAZON.COM, INC.
  
 


 Case
  No.:  22STCV14386 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: August 14, 2024



 
Defendant’s
motion to compel arbitration is GRANTED. This action is stayed pending the
completion of arbitration proceedings.
 
            On
4/29/2022, Plaintiff Muhammad Afridi (Plaintiff), representing himself in
propria persona, filed a Complaint against Amazon.com, Inc (Defendant). 
 
             On 6/14/2024, Defendant moved to compel
arbitration of Plaintiff’s Complaint, and stay proceedings. 
 
Legal Standard 
 
Where the Court has determined that an agreement to
arbitrate a controversy exists, the Court shall order the petitioner and the
respondent to arbitrate the controversy …unless it determines that…  grounds exist for rescission of the
agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.) Among the grounds which can support
rescission are fraud, duress, and unconscionability. (Tiri v. Lucky Chances, Inc. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 231, 239.) The
Court may also decline to compel arbitration wherein there is possibility of
conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1281.2 (c).) 
 
Discussion 
 
I.                  
Defendants’ Burden 
 
The party moving to compel arbitration “bears the burden
of proving [the] existence [of an arbitration agreement] by a preponderance of
the evidence.” (Rosenthal v. Great
Western Fin. Securities Corp. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 413.) The moving party
also bears the burden of demonstrating that the claims fall within the scope of
the arbitration agreement. (Omar v.
Ralphs Grocery Co. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 955, 961.)
 
            Here,
Defendants submitted evidence that Plaintiff agreed to the first Terms of
Service (TOS) in 2018 when he affirmatively clicked his assent to the agreement
as a whole and the arbitration provision in signing up to perform Amazon Flex
deliveries. He then agreed to the Second TOS by performing deliveries after he
received the terms that included a revised choice of law provision on October
3, 2019. Individualized email notice of a terms of service update suffices to
bind a plaintiff to the updated terms when the plaintiff continues to use the
service after receiving the notice. (See, e.g., In re Facebook Biometric
Info. Privacy Litig., 185 F.Supp.3d 1155, 1167 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (explaining
that “individualized notice” of a terms of service update “in combination with
a user’s continued use [of the defendant’s platform] is enough for notice and
assent”); Webber v. Uber Techs., Inc., No. 18-cv-2491, 2018 WL 10151934,
at *4 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 5, 2018) (“Courts have found that when consumers receive
emails such as this one, continued use of the service of product constitutes
assent to the updated terms.”).
 
Plaintiff
received an individualized email notifying him of the change in the terms of
service, and thereafter he scheduled and performed deliveries. (Cummings Decl.
¶¶ 13-15.) By continuing to use the Flex App in this way after receiving the
email, Plaintiff manifested his agreement to the Second TOS.
 
Both TOS
contained arbitration provisions. Both provisions broadly apply to all claims
or disputes that arise out of or relate in any way to Plaintiff’s participation
in the Amazon Flex program or performance of services. (First TOS § 11(a);
Second TOS § 11(a).) As such, these broad provisions readily cover Plaintiff’s
claims in his lawsuit. 
 
Given that
Defendant has established by a preponderance of the evidence that an
arbitration agreement exists, and that Plaintiff’s claims are covered by that
agreement, the burden shifts to the Plaintiff to establish that the arbitration
clause should not be enforced. (Pinnacle
Museum Tower Assn. v. Pinnacle Market Development (US), LLC (2012) 55
Cal.4th 223, 236. (Pinnacle).)
 
Plaintiff did
not oppose this motion. 
 
Moreover,
Plaintiff filed a document on 7/5/2024 titled a “Stipulation to Pause
Proceedings” which was not signed by Defendant, but which appeared to concede
that this matter should be paused for the parties to participate in “neutral
driven dispute resolution.”Still, the Court notes that Plaintiff’s filing
states that “[i]f the dispute is not resolved in the mandatory dispute
resolution, the court may order to proceed the case to trial.” (Stip., 1:
27-28.) Given Plaintiff’s pro per status, the Court takes the opportunity to
inform Plaintiff that judicial proceedings are not available as an alternative
forum where arbitration is mandatory. 
 
Here,
Plaintiff did not oppose this motion, and thus has not met his burden to set forth
any basis for not enforcing the underlying arbitration provisions. As such,
this case may not proceed to trial and may only be properly resolved in an
arbitration setting.
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration is granted. This action is
stayed pending the completion of arbitration proceedings.
 
 
It is so ordered.
