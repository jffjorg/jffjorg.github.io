And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent the defendant from transferring a property in Israel to a third party. The plaintiff had obtained a judgment against the defendant in 2010 for $964,709.14 and had previously renewed the judgment. The plaintiff argued that the defendant had been attempting to avoid enforcement of the judgment by transferring the property to the third party. The judge found that the plaintiff had presented sufficient evidence to support this claim, including the defendant's denial of owning real property in Israel and his confirmation of the signature for the purchase of the property. The judge also noted that the defendant had not provided documentation for an alleged "trust" that would transfer the property to the third party. The judge granted the preliminary injunction, ordering the defendant and the third party not to transfer or hypothecate the property to anyone else.
