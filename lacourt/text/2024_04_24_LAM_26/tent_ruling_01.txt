            On December 15, 2023, Plaintiff
filed this instant motion for issue and evidence sanctions against Defendant Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center (“CSMC”) for failure to obey court orders re to Plaintiff’s
request for production of documents, set three. On April 11, 2024, CSMC filed
its opposition. On April 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed her reply. 
Allegations of the
Operative Complaint
The SAC alleges that:
Kerlan-Jobe is a network
of Orthopedic surgery centers and clinics founded by Drs. Robert Kerlan and
Frank Jobe, and mainly focused on select sports injuries. (SAC ¶¶ 13-16.)
Plaintiff worked with Dr.
Jobe for about seven (7) years at Centinela Hospital before he recruited her to
join Kerlan-Jobe in 1997. (SAC ¶ 17.) After Dr. Jobe passed away, Kerlan-Jobe
underwent new leadership that increased its case load and expanded its
portfolio of services to include pediatric orthopedics, total hip, and knee
replacement, the spine, etc.  (SAC ¶¶
22-23.)
“Kerlan-Jobe partnered
with Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Department of Orthopedics, to expand and/or
establish a network of surgery centers and clinics launching the Cedars Sinai
Kerlan-Jobe Institute.” (SAC ¶ 24.)
“Kerlan-Jobe prioritized
profit over patient care,” which led to a high volume, fast paced work
environment and resulted in a revolving door of employees and frequent
openings. (SAC ¶¶ 25-26.)
            “Dr. Neal S. ElAttrache took over
Dr. Jobe’s patients” (SAC ¶ 27.) “His surgeries were substantially delayed
because he overbooked himself.” (SAC ¶ 28.) “To mitigate the appearance of long
delays, Dr. ElAttrache regularly brought patients into the operating room and
put them under total, general anesthesia long before the actual surgery began.”
(SAC ¶ 29.) “Dr. ElAttrache would abandon his patients for long periods of time
sometimes upwards to around an hour or so to handle post-operation matters for
other patients and/or his phone calls.” (SAC ¶ 34.) “All the while, his
patients were needlessly exposed to general anesthesia and associated risks,
charged for unnecessary medical care, and remained in the operating room until
Dr. ElAttrache decided to return. ” (SAC ¶ 35.) “This practice delayed the
remaining surgeries scheduled for the day and forced surgery technicians to
work late.” (SAC ¶ 36.) Plaintiff and other staff objected to Dr. ElAttrache’s
practices out of concern for the patients and felt overwhelmed. (SAC ¶ 38.)
            In the summer of 2020, management
began pressuring Plaintiff to resign based on her being fifty (50) years of
age. (SAC ¶¶ 42-43.) “Trudy Wiig, the Administrator of the Surgery Center,
asked Ms. Holman whether she was willing to work part-time because of her age.
The request
was motivated by ageism.  Ms. Wiig said
words to the effect that [Plaintiff]’s name came up during a Board Meeting and
they were concerned that in her old age she would not be able to keep up.” (SAC
¶ 44.) Plaintiff declined, expressing her desire to keep working including
regular overtime. (SAC ¶ 46.)  Trudy then
asked Plaintiff if she would consider accepting a severance package from
Defendants in exchange for early retirement, which Plaintiff also declined.
(SAC ¶¶ 47-48.) “The next day, Kevin Bowdry, the Director of Nursing, asked [Plaintiff]
to consider Ms. Wiig’s offers.  [Plaintiff]
refused.” (SAC ¶ 49.)
            “In the winter of 2020, multiple
employees, including several surgery technicians, were out on leave due to
illness.” (SAC ¶ 51.) This required Plaintiff to cover additional surgeries and
give up her lunch and work without meal and rest breaks. (SAC ¶¶ 54-56.) Around
December of 2020, Plaintiff confronted Mr. Bowdry about the intolerable work
conditions including requiring staff to work through lunch without rest breaks,
not being properly compensated for all hours worked, and Dr. ElAttrache’s
preference for high volume placing patients at risk with their true consent.
(SAC ¶¶ 58-60.) Mr. Bowdry dismissed Plaintiff’s concerns. (SAC ¶ 61.)
            “On May 17, 2021, [Plaintiff]’s
doctor placed her on medical leave so that she could undergo treatment for
rheumatoid arthritis.” (SAC ¶ 62.) On or about August 17, 2021, Plaintiff
exhausted her 12-week CFRA/FMLA leave and required an extension of medical
leave through October 4, 2021 for a total of four months and two weeks of
leave. (SAC ¶¶ 63-64.) Such leave had been provided regularly to Plaintiff in
the past and to younger employees who took even longer leave. (SAC ¶¶ 65-68.)
“[O]n or about October 1, 2021, [Plaintiff]’s doctor notified Kerlan-Jobe that [Plaintiff]
was released to return on October 5, 2021, to her full-time position with no
restrictions.” (SAC ¶ 69.) However, Defendants terminated Plaintiff even though
work was available. (SAC ¶ 70.) Defendants preferred to replace Plaintiff with
a younger employee with less experience than Plaintiff and continued to fill
surgery technician openings with substantially younger employees. (SAC ¶¶
71-74.)
Legal Standard
Code
of Civil Procedure Section 2023.030, states in pertinent part: “To the extent
authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any
other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected party,
person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose…[monetary,
issue, evidence, or terminating] sanctions against anyone engaging in the
misuse of the discovery process….” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subds. (a)-(d).)
“Misuses of the discovery process include, but are not limited to…(d) Failing to respond
or to submit to an authorized method of discovery…(g) Disobeying a court
order to provide discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)
            “Nevertheless, absent unusual
circumstances, such as repeated and egregious discovery abuses, two facts are
generally prerequisite to the imposition of a nonmonetary sanction. There must
be a failure to comply with a court order and the failure must be willful.” (Lee
v. Lee (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1553, 1559.) “Even where nonmonetary
sanctions are called for, they ‘”…’ should be appropriate to the dereliction,
and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the
party entitled to but denied discovery.’ [Citations] ‘”…[¶] The sanctions the
court may impose are such as are suitable and necessary to enable the party
seeking discovery to obtain the objects of the discovery he seeks, but the
court may not impose sanctions which are designed not to accomplish the objects
of discovery but to impose punishment.’”’ [Citations.]” (Biles v. Exxon
Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327.)
            “A trial court has broad discretion
when imposing a discovery sanction.” (Lee, supra, 175 Cal.App.4th at 1559.) “In
exercising this discretion [for nonmonetary sanctions], a variety of factors
may be relevant, including, 1) the time which has elapsed since [the discovery
requests] were served, 2) whether the party served was previously given a
voluntary extension of time, 3) the number of [the discovery requests]
propounded, 4) whether the unanswered questions sought information which was
difficult to obtain, 5) whether the answers supplied were evasive and
incomplete, 6) the number of questions which remained unanswered, 7) whether
the questions which remained unanswered are material to a particular claim or
defense, 8) whether the answering party has acted in good faith, and with
reasonable diligence, 9) the existence of prior orders compelling discovery and
the answering party’s response thereto, 10) whether the party was unable to comply
with the previous order of the court, 11) whether an order allowing more time
to answer would enable the answering party to supply the necessary information,
and 12) whether a sanction short of dismissal or default would be appropriate
to the dereliction.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771,
796-97.)
Discussion
Plaintiff seeks 11
issue and evidence sanctions on the grounds that CSMC failed to comply with the
October 24, 2023 order of the Court. 
CSMC Complied with the October 24, 2023 Order
The October 24,
2023 Order required CSMC to provide code complaint responses to Request for
Production of Documents, Set Three, Nos. 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 106,
107, 108, 110, 113, and 114, within 30 days along with a privilege log
identifying every document withheld based on what specific privilege and
specific basis for the redactions. Plaintiff argues CSMC produced redacted
documents on the basis of overruled and unsupported objections, non-code compliant
responses, and refuses to produce all responsive documents. Furthermore,
Plaintiff contends she never stipulated to limit discovery to one or two
responsive documents only. 
In opposition,
CSMC argues it timely served valid responses to Plaintiff’s Request for
Production of Documents, Set Three, produced documents pursuant to the Parties’
agreement, and provided a privilege log in compliance with the October 24, 2023
Order. CSMC further asserts (1) the information it redacted in its production
(but identified in its log) consists of totally immaterial but protected,
private financial information that would provide CSMC’s peers an unfair
competitive advantage if disclosed; (2) Plaintiff has not and cannot articulate
any compelling need for the redacted information, nor can CSMC rely on the
parties’ stipulated protective order given Plaintiff’s previous failure to
abide by its terms; (3) Plaintiff’s issue and evidence sanctions go beyond the
underlying requests and are not supported by the information Plaintiff has
obtained through discovery by all named Defendants, including, responses to
interrogatories, request for admissions, requests for production of documents,
and other documents produced in this case; and (4) if granted, Plaintiff’s
issue and evidence sanctions would result in a windfall to Plaintiff and
disproportionate and unjustified punishment to CSMC.
In reply,
Plaintiff contends CSMC’s objections on grounds of relevance and privacy cited
in its privilege log are not akin to any statutory privilege that allows CSMC
to make the same redactions to relevant documents as before. Furthermore,
Plaintiff argues CSMC concedes that it continues to withhold documents and that
its responses are evasive despite stating all documents will be produced as to
RPD Nos. 98 and 100. Similarly, Plaintiff argues CSMC does not dispute it
failed to produce all responsive documents and that the sole document produced
is missing most, if not all responsive information as to RPD Nos. 99, 101, 102,
103, 106, 110, 113, and 114. Likewise, Plaintiff argues CSMC makes the same
argument rejected by the Court that producing an agreement to manage the
Surgery Center did not require CSMC to produce documents showing CSMC manages
the Surgery Center. Additionally, Plaintiff asserts CSMC failed to show that
the issue sanctions place Plaintiff in a better position. Finally, Plaintiff
contends regardless of whether issue sanctions are granted, it is abuse of
discretion to deny mandatory monetary sanctions upon finding that Defendants
disobeyed court orders.

control, and/or custody that were  responsive to the requests. CSMC referenced
documents produced by bates numbers. Furthermore, CSMC provided a privilege log
identifying the documents and the basis for the specific privilege being
invoked. Moreover, the parties agreed that CSMC would not produce duplicative
documents if they are responsive to the information being sought. Thus,
imposition of issue and evidence sanctions is not warranted. 
Request for Monetary Sanctions
            “Except
as provided in subdivision (d), if a party then fails to obey an order
compelling inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the court may make those
orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that sanction, the court may
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)..”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.320, subd. (c).)
            Plaintiff
requests monetary sanctions in the total amount of $8,911.65 at an hourly rate
of $590.00 for (1) 10.0 hours spent researching and reviewing case law,
drafting the Notice  of Motion and
Motion, Separate statement, accompanying declaration, reviewing exhibits, and
meeting and conferring; (3) anticipates 5.0 hours reviewing the opposition
papers, preparing the reply, and attending the hearing; and (4) $61.65 filing
fee. Plaintiff has not shown that Cedars-Sinai Medical Center failed to comply
with the October 24, 2023 order concerning Request for Production of Documents,
Set Three, Nos. 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 106, 107, 108, 110, 113, and
114. Thus, the Court will not impose monetary sanctions against Defendant Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center. 
Conclusion and ORDER
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff
Kristina Holman’s Motion for Issue and Evidence Sanctions against Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for
Failure to Obey Court Orders Re to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set Three is DENIED. 
            Plaintiff’s request for monetary
sanctions is also DENIED. 
            Moving Party to give notice.
