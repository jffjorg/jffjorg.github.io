And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

On February 6, 2024, a tentative ruling was made regarding a case number 22STCV11779. The parties agreed to a stipulation for the terms and conditions of a mental examination. As a result, the moving party (defendant) will cancel the Court Reservation System (CRS) reservation for the motion to compel mental examination set for March 7, 2024. The parties will continue to meet and confer regarding the plaintiff's motion to quash subpoenas to their subsequent employers. If the parties resolve all pending discovery issues, the moving party must take the pending motion off-calendar via the CRS system and cancel all CRS reservations. If not, the parties must file a joint statement by March 7, 2024, proposing revisions to the subpoenas to third-party employers. The defendant is also ordered to give notice of this order and file proof of service.
