[1] Unverified responses “are
tantamount to no responses at all.” (Appleton
v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.)  


[2] If the occasion
arises in the future in this action, the parties must meet and confer regarding
each issue that they ultimately wish to raise in any motion to compel further.  Failure to comply will result in the Court
denying the motion as to any issue that the moving party failed to raise in
meet and confer efforts.
