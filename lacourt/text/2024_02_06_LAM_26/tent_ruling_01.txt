[TENTATIVE] order RE:
defendant kaiser foundation health plan, inc.’s motion to compel
  plaintiff’s further response to request for production of documents, set one 



Procedural Background
            On February 14, 2022, Plaintiff Nicole
Swainston (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant wrongful termination action against Defendants
Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, Inc. (erroneously sued as Kaiser Foundation Health
Plan, Inc.) (“KFH”) and Glen Har (jointly “Defendants”).  The complaint asserts thirteen causes of
action for (1) Sex Discrimination in Violation of the Fair Employment and
Housing Act (“FEHA”), (2) Disability Discrimination in Violation of FEHA, (3)
Failure to Engage in the Interactive Process in Violation of FEHA, (4) Failure
to Accommodate in Violation of FEHA, (5) California Family Rights Act (“CFRA”) Interference,
(6) Retaliation in Violation of FEHA, (7) Sexually Hostile Work Environment in
Violation of FEHA, (8) Failure to Prevent Harassment, Discrimination, and
Retaliation in Violation of FEHA, (9) Wrongful Termination in Violation of
Public Policy, (10) Violation of Labor Code sections 98.6 and 1102.5, (11)
Violation of Labor Code sections 6310 and 6311, (12) Violation of Labor Code
sections 226.7 and 512, and (13) Violation of Labor Code sections 510, 1194,
1198 and 1199.
            On September 25, 2023, Defendant KFH
filed the instant motion to compel Plaintiff’s further response to Request for
Production of Documents, Set One (“RPDs”). 
On January 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition.  On January 30, 2024, Defendant KFH filed a
reply.
 
Legal
Standard 
Requests
for Production of Documents
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310
provides, in pertinent part, as follows:
(a) On receipt
of a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the
demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand
if the demanding party deems that any of the following apply:
(1) A
statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete.
(2) A
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
(3) An
objection in the response is without merit or too general.
(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following:
(1) The motion
shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery
sought by the demand.
(2) The motion
shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.
 
Code
Complaint Response
A
code-compliant response to a request for production consists of any of the
following: (1) a statement that the party will comply, (2) a representation
that the party lacks the ability to comply, or (3) an objection.  (CCP §§ 2031.210.)  A statement that the
party will comply must state that the Request for Production (“RPD”) “will be
allowed either in whole or in part, and that all documents or things in the
demanded category that are in the possession, custody, or control of that party
and to which no objection is being made will be included in the
production.”  (CCP § 2031.220.)  “If only part of an item or category of
item in a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
objectionable, the response shall contain a statement of compliance, or a
representation of inability to comply with respect to the remainder of that
item or category.”  (CCP §
2031.240(a).)  If an objection is made
the responding party must “[i]dentify with particularity any document, tangible
thing, land, or electronically stored information falling within any category
of item in the demand to which an objection is being made.”  (CCP § 2031.240(b)(1).)
 
Discussion 
            Defendant
KFH seeks to compel Plaintiff’s further response to RPDs No. 1-40, and 44.
 
Meet and Confer
            Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310(b)(2) a motion to compel further
responses to a request for production “shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” 
(CCP § 2031.310(b)(2).) “A meet and confer declaration in support of a
motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.”  (CCP § 2016.040.)  “The level of effort at informal resolution
which satisfies the ‘reasonable and good faith attempt’ standard depends upon
the circumstances. In a larger, more complex discovery context, a greater
effort at informal resolution may be warranted. In a simpler, or more narrowly
focused case, a more modest effort may suffice. The history of the litigation,
the nature of the interaction between counsel, the nature of the issues, the
type and scope of discovery requested, the prospects for success and other
similar factors can be relevant.”  (Obregon
v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.)
            On
March 15, 2022, Defendant KFH propounded the RPDs at issue on Plaintiff.  (Rankin Decl. ¶ 3.)  On September 14, 2022, Plaintiff served
unverified responses to the RPDs at issue.[1]  (Rankin Decl. ¶ 4.)  In December 2022, Defense Counsel sent a
meet-and-confer letter to Plaintiff’s Counsel regarding the deficiencies with Plaintiff’s
discovery responses.  (Rankin Decl. ¶
8.)  On March 9, 2023, the parties telephonically
met and conferred, and Plaintiff’s counsel agreed to serve supplemental
responses to the RPDs at issue.  (Rankin
Decl. ¶ 8.)  On May 24, 2023, Plaintiff
served unverified amended responses. 
(Rankin Decl. ¶ 10.)
            On
June 14, 2023, Defense Counsel sent another meet and confer letter regarding
the deficiencies in Plaintiff’s unverified amended responses.  (Rankin Decl. ¶ 11, Exh. F.)  On July 31, 2023, the parties further met and
conferred telephonically, and Plaintiff’s Counsel agreed to serve further
amended responses.  (Rankin Decl. ¶ 11.)  On September 19, 2023, Plaintiff served verified
further response to the RPDs at issue. 
(Rankin Decl. ¶ 14, Exh. H.)  No
privilege log has been produced by Plaintiff. 
(Rankin Decl. ¶ 14.)
            The
parties telephonically met and conferred multiple times.  Further, Plaintiff does not contend in
opposition that the meet and confer efforts were insufficient.  Accordingly, given the nature of the dispute
and the telephonic meet and confer efforts, the Court finds that Defendant KFH
has sufficiently met and conferred.[2]

            “Please
produce all DOCUMENTS reflecting YOUR efforts to mitigate your damages.”  (RPD No. 44.)
            
            In
near identical response, Plaintiff responded as follows:
            “Objection:
This request calls for information which is available to all parties equally,
and is therefore oppressive and burdensome to Plaintiff. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2019.030, subd. (a)(1), Panzalas v.
Superior Court (1969) 272 Cal.App.2d 499, Alpine v. Superior Court (1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 45.) This request is unreasonably cumulative or
duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient,
less burdensome, or less expensive. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2019.030, subd.
(a)(1).) This request invades Plaintiff’s right of privacy. (Pioneer Electronics (USA) Inc. v. Superior Court (2007) 40 Cal.4th 360, 370; San Diego
Unified Port Dist. (1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 855–856.) This request is
overly broad and remote and calls for information not relevant to the subject
matter of this action nor reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. (CBS v. Superior
Court (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 12, Deaile v. Gen’l Telephone (1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 841.) This question seeks information which is
protected from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege. (Brown v. Superior Court (1963) 218 Cal.App.2d 430.) This question seeks information which is
protected from disclosure by the attorney work-product privilege. (Id.) This request seeks to
impermissibly invade the privacy of uninvolved third parties as well as
Plaintiff in violation of the constitutions of California and the United
States. 
            Without
waiving said objections, Plaintiff responds as follows: 
            After
a diligent search, Plaintiff will produce all responsive documents in
Plaintiff’s possession and control, of which Plaintiff is aware, and which may
relate to this request.
            Investigation
and discovery in this matter are continuing and not complete. Plaintiff
reserves the right, but does not assume the obligation, to amend and/or
supplement this response if and when the subsequent responsive information is
discovered.”  (Response to RPDs 1-19, 22,
24 30, 32, 34-37, 44.)
 
            Equally
Available and Burden Objections
            Objections
based on “burden must be sustained by
evidence showing the quantum of work required” and “to support an objection of
oppression there must be some showing either of an intent to create an
unreasonable burden or that the ultimate effect of the burden is incommensurate
with the result sought.”  (West Pico
Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v. Superior Court In and For Los Angeles County (1961)
56 Cal.2d 407, 417.)  Moreover, even if
[discovery requests] are found to be “burdensome and oppressive,” the Court
should not simply sustain the objection and thereby excuse any answer. Rather,
the Court should limit the question to a reasonable scope. (Borse v.
Superior Court (Southern Pac. Co.) (1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 286, 289.)
            Here, Plaintiff’s response fails to identify any quantum
of work required to respond to these requests. 
Similarly, Plaintiff’s opposition to the instant motion fails to
identify the quantum of work required to respond to these requests so as to
support an objection based on burden. 
Moreover, Plaintiff’s objection based on the documents being “equally
available” to Defendant is nonsensical and clearly not applicable.  Defendant has requested documents supporting
Plaintiff’s claims and allegations in the complaint.  As Defendant disputes Plaintiff’s claims and
is not bringing said claims, Defendant would be unaware of every document
supporting Plaintiff’s claims.  It is
Plaintiff’s obligation to identify and produce such documents.
 
            Relevance Objections
            “[A]ny party may obtain discovery regarding
any matters, not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter involved in
the pending action or to the determination of any motion made in that action,
if the matter either is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”  (CCP §
2017.010.)  “[A]n implicit waiver of a party's constitutional rights
encompasses only discovery directly relevant to the plaintiff's claim and
essential to the fair resolution of the lawsuit.”  (Vinson v. Superior
Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833, 842.)  However, discovery should not be
denied if the information sought has any relevance to the subject
matter. Thus, while relevancy is a possible ground for an objection, it is
difficult to adequately justify it.  (See generally Coy v. Superior Court of
Contra Costa County (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 217.)  “These rules are applied liberally in favor
of discovery, and (contrary to popular
belief), fishing expeditions are permissible in some
cases.”  (Gonzalez v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th
1539, 1546 [internal citation omitted].)  
            Here, all of the RPDs are plainly relevant as they seek
documents in support of Plaintiff’s claims – i.e., RPDs No. 1-13 – and
documents supporting Plaintiff’s allegations and prayer for damages in the
complaint – i.e., RPDs 14-19, 22, 24 30, 32, 34-37, 44.  Thus, the documents sought are plainly
relevant to the complaint, and Plaintiff’s objections based on relevance are
clearly unjustified.
 
            Privacy Objections
            The right of privacy in the California Constitution (art. I, § 1),
“protects the individual's reasonable expectation of privacy against a serious
invasion.”  (Puerto v. Superior Court
(2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1250 [italics in original]; See Williams v.
Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 552 [“In Hill, we established a
framework for evaluating potential invasions of privacy. The party asserting a
privacy right must establish a legally protected privacy interest, an
objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the given circumstances, and a
threatened intrusion that is serious. 
The party seeking information may raise in response whatever legitimate
and important countervailing interests disclosure serves, while the party
seeking protection may identify feasible alternatives that serve the same
interests or protective measures that would diminish the loss of privacy. A
court must then balance these competing considerations.”].)
            As the Supreme Court
has “previously observed, the right of privacy extends to sexual
relations (Vinson v. Superior Court, supra, 43 Cal.3d at
p. 841, 239) and medical records (Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic
Assn. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 41.).” 
(John B. v. Superior Court (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1177,
1198.)  Similarly, the constitutional
right to freedom of association requires protection of a person’s membership in
associations, whether they pertain to religious, political, economic, or even
purely social matters.  (Britt v.
Superior Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 852; see also Pacific-Union
Club v. Superior Court (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 60, 71.)  Further, “‘Courts have frequently recognized
that individuals have a substantial interest in the privacy of
their home.’ [Citation.]”  (Puerto,
supra, 158 Cal.App.4th at p.1252.)  
            In asserting a privacy
interest, “the burden [is] on the party asserting a privacy interest
to establish its extent and the seriousness of the prospective invasion,
and against that showing must weigh the countervailing interests the opposing
party identifies, as Hill requires.”  (Williams, supra, 3 Cal.5th 531,
557.)  “Only obvious invasions of
interests fundamental to personal autonomy must be supported by a compelling
interest.”  (Ibid.)
            Here, Plaintiff’s response fails to specify how any of
the above requests invade Plaintiff’s or unspecified third parties’ privacy
rights.  Similarly, Plaintiff fails to
justify any privacy objections to these requests in the opposition.  Moreover, each of the requests is directly
relevant to Plaintiff’s claims. 
Accordingly, the privacy objections are unwarranted and unsupported.
 
            Attorney Client Privilege/Work
Product Privilege
“In general, when a party asserts the attorney-client privilege, that
party has the burden of showing the preliminary facts necessary to support the
privilege.”  (Venture Law Group v.
Superior Court (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 96, 102.)  “The party asserting the privilege need only
present facts which ‘support a prima facie claim of privilege.”  (OXY Resources California LLC v. Superior
Court (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 874, 894.) 
“After this burden is met, or where there is no dispute concerning the
preliminary facts, the burden shifts to the party opposing the privilege to
show either the claimed privilege does not apply, an exception exists, or there
has been an express or implied waiver.” 
(Venture Law Group, supra, 118 Cal.App.4th at p.102.) 
Here, given that Defendant KFH is
requesting all documents in support of Plaintiff’s claims the requests could conceivably
include documents that could be protected by attorney client privilege.  However, Plaintiff has failed to provide any
privilege log identifying what -- if any -- responsive documents Plaintiff is
withholding on the basis of attorney client privilege/work product.  To the extent that there are privileged
documents, Plaintiff has not indicated which specific document are
privileged.  Plaintiff’s blanket
assertion of privilege is insufficient.  Plaintiff
must produce a privilege log identifying what documents Plaintiff is
withholding and enough factual information to support a prima facie claim of
privilege. (See CCP § 2031.240(b)(1-2), [“b) If the responding party
objects to the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of an item
or category of item, the response shall do both of the following: (1) Identify
with particularity any document, tangible thing, land, or electronically
stored information falling within any category of item in the demand to which
an objection is being made. (2) Set forth clearly the extent of, and the
specific ground for, the objection. If an objection is based on a claim of
privilege, the particular privilege invoked shall be stated. If an objection is
based on a claim that the information sought is protected work product under Chapter
4 (commencing with Section 2018.010), that claim shall be expressly asserted.”]
[Italics added.].)  
Accordingly, Plaintiff must provide a
privilege log identifying which if any documents Plaintiff is withholding and
enough information to demonstrate that the attorney client privilege/work
product protects the document(s) identified.
 
            Improper Substantive Responses
            Here,
Plaintiff’s substantive responses provide that “[w]ithout waiving
said objections, Plaintiff
responds as follows: After a diligent search, Plaintiff will produce all
responsive documents in Plaintiff’s possession and control, of which Plaintiff
is aware, and which may relate to this request.”  (Response to RPDs No. 1-19, 22, 24 30, 32,
34-37, 44, [Italics Added].)  
            Plaintiff
has not waived any objections.  Thus, it
is unclear whether documents are being withheld based on such objections.  Therefore, Plaintiff was required to identify
the documents being withheld and the basis for the withholding.  (See CCP § 2031.240(b)(1-2), [“b) If
the responding party objects to the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or
sampling of an item or category of item, the response shall do both of the
following: (1) Identify with particularity any document, tangible thing,
land, or electronically stored information falling within any category of item
in the demand to which an objection is being made. (2) Set forth clearly the
extent of, and the specific ground for, the objection. If an objection is based
on a claim of privilege, the particular privilege invoked shall be stated. If
an objection is based on a claim that the information sought is protected work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010), that claim shall be
expressly asserted.”] [Italics added.].) 
If all responsive documents are being produced, the response must
clearly identify as such, expressly stating that Plaintiff has produced all
responsive documents in its possession, custody, or control and identify the
responsive documents.  (CCP § 2031.280.)  Accordingly, further code complaint responses
are required. 
 
            Failure
to Produce All Responsive Documents
            Defendant
KFH contends that Plaintiff has not produced all responsive documents including
text messages between Plaintiff and Iliana Bonilla.  In an unrelated pending action between
Bonilla and KFH – Bonilla v. Kaiser
Foundation Hospitals, LASC Case No. 21STCV43442 – Bonilla, who is
represented by Plaintiff’s Counsel (Brinegar Decl. ¶ 2), produced text messages
between Plaintiff and Bonilla that Defendant KFH claims is relevant and
responsive to certain RPDs.  Given that
there was some overlap in discovery, the parties stipulated that the discovery
in the instant action and Bonilla v. Kaiser
Foundation Hospitals, LASC Case No. 21STCV43442 could be used in both
actions.  (Rankin Decl. ¶ 2.)
            In
opposition, Plaintiff does not dispute that the text messages between Plaintiff
and Bonilla produced in Bonilla v. Kaiser
Foundation Hospitals, LASC Case No. 21STCV43442 are relevant or
responsive to the propounded RPDs at issue. 
Rather, Plaintiff contends that “[t]he fact that the Parties agreed that
discovery in the Bonilla case could be used in Plaintiff’s case, and vice-versa, does not mean
that Plaintiff has all text messages in her possession, custody, or control
that are in Bonilla’s possession, custody, or control. Cell phones are
routinely replaced, and text messages are deleted all the time. Defendant has
no evidence that Plaintiff’s verified response that she has produced all
documents is not true.”  (Opp. at
p.3:23-27.)  
            The
fact that Plaintiff may not have possession or custody of the text messages is not
determinative or even relevant because Plaintiff must produce documents in her
possession, custody, or control.  Plaintiff’s Counsel’s
demonstrated ability to produce the text messages between Plaintiff and Bonilla
effectively demonstrates that said text messages are under Plaintiff’s
control.  Plaintiff’s Counsel is an agent
of Plaintiff.  (Rosenaur v. Scherer
(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 260, 283 [“attorneys are agents of their client…”].)  As Plaintiff’s agent (Counsel) had custody of
the responsive texts, these texts are under Plaintiff’s Control.  (See e.g., Clark v. Superior Court of
State In and For San Mateo County (1960) 177 Cal.App.2d 577, 579 [noting
that documents in the possession, custody or control of defense counsel were
thereby in the possession, custody, or control of defendants and reachable
under a request for production].)
            Therefore,
the failure to produce and identify all responsive texts between Plaintiff and
Bonilla is not compliant with the response that Plaintiff has produced all
documents under her possession, custody, and control.  
 
RPDs No. 23, 25, 31, 33, 39-40

            In
near identical response, Plaintiff responded as follows:
            “Objection:
This request invades Plaintiff’s right of privacy. (Pioneer
Electronics (USA) Inc. v. Superior Court (2007) 40
Cal.4th 360, 370; San Diego Unified
Port Dist. (1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 855–856.) This request is
overly broad and remote and calls for information not relevant to the subject
matter of this action nor reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of

25, 31, 33, 39-40.)
 
            Objections
and Substantive Response
            Here,
RPDs  23, 25, 31, 33, and 39-40 are
relevant as they seek documents supporting allegations in the complaint, documents
from witnesses, documents involving Plaintiff’s alleged medical conditions while
Plaintiff was working for KFH, and documents involving mitigating damages after
Plaintiff was allegedly constructively terminated from KFH.  Accordingly, for the same reasons set forth
with RPDs No. 1-19, 22, 24 30, 32, 34-37, and 44, the objections are
unsupported, and the substantive responses are improper.
 
RPDs No. 20-21
            “Please
produce all COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and YOUR union relating to the
allegations in YOUR complaint.”  (RPD No.
20.)
            “Please
produce all COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and Iliana Bonilla regarding the
allegations in YOUR complaint.”  (RPD No.
21.)
 
In near identical response, Plaintiff responded as
follows:
            “Objection:
This request invades Plaintiff’s right of privacy. (Pioneer
Electronics (USA) Inc. v. Superior Court (2007) 40
Cal.4th 360, 370; San Diego Unified
Port Dist. (1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 855–856.) This question
seeks information which is protected from disclosure by the attorney-client
privilege. (Brown v. Superior
Court (1963) 218 Cal.App.2d 430.) This question seeks
information which is protected from disclosure by the attorney work-product
privilege. (Id.) This request seeks to impermissibly invade the privacy of uninvolved
third parties as well as Plaintiff in violation of the constitutions of
California and the United States. 
            Without
waiving said objections, Plaintiff responds as follows: 
            After
a diligent search, Plaintiff will produce all responsive documents in
Plaintiff’s possession and control, of which Plaintiff is aware, and which may
relate to this request.     Investigation
and discovery in this matter are continuing and not complete. Plaintiff
reserves the right, but does not assume the obligation, to amend and/or
supplement this response if and when the subsequent responsive information is
discovered.

            Here,
the RPDs No. 20-21 are relevant as they seek documents supporting allegations

objections are unsupported, and the substantive responses are improper.
 
RPD No. 26
            “Please
produce copies of all witness statements that YOU or YOUR agents have obtained
from DEFENDANT’s employees regarding the allegations in YOUR complaint.”  (RPD No. 26.)
            “Objection:
This question seeks information which is protected from disclosure by the
attorney-client privilege. (Brown v. Superior
Court (1963) 218 Cal.App.2d 430.) This question seeks

            Without
waiving said objections, Plaintiff responds as follows: 
            Plaintiff
currently has no documents responsive to this request in Plaintiff’s
possession, custody, or control. 
            Investigation
and discovery in this matter are continuing and not complete. Plaintiff
reserves the right, but does not assume the obligation, to amend and/or

            Objections
and Substantive Response
            Here,
RPD No. 26 is relevant as it seeks documents of witnesses’ statements.  Accordingly, for the same reasons set forth
with RPDs No. 1-19, 22, 24 30, 32, 34-37, and 44, the objections are
unsupported.  
Moreover, the
substantive response is improper.  A
statement of an inability to comply requires Plaintiff to “affirm that a
diligent search and a reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply
with that demand.”  (CCP § 2031.230.)  Further, the response must “also specify
whether the inability to comply is because the particular item or category has
never existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has
never been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the
responding party.”  (CCP §
2031.230.)  
            Here, no
affirmation of a diligent search has been provided.  Further, Plaintiff fails to specify whether “the
particular item or category has never existed, has been destroyed, has been
lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the
possession, custody, or control of the responding party.”  (CCP § 2031.230.)  Accordingly, a further response is required.
 
RPDs No. 27-28
            “Please
produce all COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (‘EEOC’) regarding YOUR employment with DEFENDANT.”  (RPD No. 27.)
            “Please
produce all COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and the Department of Fair Employment
and Housing (‘DFEH’) regarding YOUR employment with DEFENDANT.”  (RPD No. 28.)
 
In near identical response, Plaintiff responded as

            “Objection:

27-28.)
 
Objections and Substantive Response
            Here,
the RPDs No. 27-28 are relevant as they seek documents revealing whether
Plaintiff fulfilled her requirement to exhaust administrative remedies.  Accordingly, for the same reasons set forth
with RPDs No. 1-19, 22, 24 30, 32, 34-37, and 44, the objections are
unsupported, and the substantive responses are improper.
 
RPD No. 29
            “Please
produce all DOCUMENTS that YOU submitted to any government agency, including
but not limited to the DFEH and the EEOC, that refer or relate to the
allegations in YOUR complaint.”  (RPD No.
29.)
            “Objection:
Objection: This request calls for information which is available to all parties
equally, and is therefore oppressive and burdensome to Plaintiff. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2019.030, subd. (a)(1), Panzalas v.
Superior Court (1969) 272 Cal.App.2d 499, Alpine v. Superior Court (1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 45.) This request is unreasonably cumulative or
duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient,
less burdensome, or less expensive. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2019.030, subd.
(a)(1).) This request invades Plaintiff’s right of privacy. (Pioneer Electronics (USA) Inc. v. Superior Court (2007) 40 Cal.4th 360, 370; San Diego Unified
Port Dist. (1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 855–856 This question seeks

            Objections
and Substantive Response
            Here,
the RPD No. 29 is relevant as it seeks documents supporting allegations in the
complaint.  Accordingly, for the same
reasons set forth with RPDs No. 1-19, 22, 24 30, 32, 34-37, and 44, the
objections are unsupported, and the substantive responses are improper.
 
 
RPD No. 38
            “Please
produce a copy of YOUR current resume.” 
(RPD No. 38.)
            “After
a diligent search, Plaintiff will produce all responsive documents in
Plaintiff’s possession and control, of which Plaintiff is aware, and which may
relate to this request.     Investigation
and discovery in this matter are continuing and not complete. Plaintiff
reserves the right, but does not assume the obligation, to amend and/or
supplement this response if and when the subsequent responsive information is
discovered.”  (Response to RPD No. 38.)
 
            The
Substantive Response is Code Complaint
            Here,
Plaintiff has not raised any objections and has stated that she will produce
all documents in her possession custody or control.  Defendant KFH fails to provide any reason why
the response is non-compliant or why a further response is necessary.  Accordingly, no further response is required
as to this request.
 
Sanctions
Defendant KFH requests sanctions of $3,520.00 against Plaintiff and
Plaintiff’s counsel to compensate KFH for the cost in bringing the instant
motion.  Defense Counsel claims an hourly
billing rate of $400 and claims to have spent 6.8 hours preparing the instant
motion and 4 hours reviewing the opposition, preparing the reply, and appearing
at the hearing.  (Rankin Decl. ¶ 18.)
For a motion to compel further responses,
“[t]he court shall impose a monetary sanction … against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response to [request for production], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (CCP § 2031.300(c), [italics added].)  Further, it is an abuse of discovery to make
an evasive response or make unsubstantiated objections to discovery.  (CCP § 2023.010(e)-(f).)
Here, given Plaintiff’s unsubstantiated
objections and failure to produce all responsive documents does warrant some
sanction.  However, the requested amount
is slightly excessive.  
Accordingly, based on the totality of the
circumstances the Court finds that $1,600.00 reasonably represents the fees and
costs incurred.  Plaintiff Nicole
Swainston and her counsel of record – Lawrance Bohm, Kelsey Ciarimboli, and
Kyle Pruner – are jointly and severally liable and ordered to pay sanctions to Kaiser
Foundation Hospitals, Inc., by and through counsel of record, in the amount of
$1,600.00, within 30 days of notice of this order.
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Based on the foregoing, Defendant Kaiser
Foundation Hospitals, Inc.’s motion to compel Plaintiff Nicole Swainston’s further
response to Request for Production of Documents, Set One is GRANTED IN PART.
Plaintiff Nicole Swainston is to provide a further code compliant
response to Request for Production, Set One No. 1-38, 40, and 44 without
objection except as to attorney-client/work product privilege within 25 days of
notice of this order.  Plaintiff Nicole
Swainston is to simultaneously provide a privilege log specifically identifying
any documents withheld and redactions based on attorney client privilege/work
product, and containing enough information to clearly denote that the
respective withheld document or redaction is subject to attorney client/work
product privilege.  (CCP § 2031.240(b).)
Plaintiff is to provide responsive documents – compliant with the
further responses – and including all documents under Plaintiff’s possession,
custody, and control, such as documents in Plaintiff’s Counsel custody such as
responsive text messages between Bonilla and Plaintiff, within thirty (30) days
of notice of this order.
The Moving Party is ordered to provide
notice of this order and file proof of service of such.
