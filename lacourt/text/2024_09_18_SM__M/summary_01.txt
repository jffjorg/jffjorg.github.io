And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings and has granted the motion. The court has determined that the plaintiff's causes of action for breach of oral contract, quiet title, and cancellation of written instrument are barred by the statute of limitations.

The court has also determined that the plaintiff's claims for fraudulent transfer under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act are without merit. The court has found that the transfer of the property to the defendants was not fraudulent and that the defendants did not intend to hinder the plaintiff's collection on the loan agreement.

The court has granted the defendant's request for judicial notice of the existence of certain documents. The court has also determined that the plaintiff's complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendant.

The court has denied the plaintiff's request for leave to amend the complaint and has ordered the plaintiff to make an offer of proof showing a reasonable probability of successful amendment in light of the court's ruling.
