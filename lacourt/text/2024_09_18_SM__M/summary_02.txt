And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by Sunbelt Rentals Inc. (SRI) against Void Studios LLC (VS) regarding the First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC). The FACC alleges three causes of action: Fraudulent Misrepresentation, Breach of Contract, and Violation of Business and Professions Code § 17200.

The judge sustains the demurrer with leave to amend as to the fraud cause of action because the FACC does not rise to the level of specificity required for pleading fraud. The FACC only identifies "sales agents and employees" as making vague representations regarding the effectiveness of the 20T Units, and does not establish how, when, where, to whom and by what means the representations were tendered.

The judge also sustains the demurrer with leave to amend as to the breach of contract cause of action because the FACC does not clearly state whether the contract was written, oral or implied by conduct.

Finally, the judge sustains the demurrer with leave to amend as to the violation of Business and Professions Code § 17200 cause of action because the fraud and breach of contract causes of action fail to state a claim, and there is no factual basis to conclude that SRI engaged in unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business practices as defined by section 17200.

The judge also rules that the motion to strike is moot. VS has 30 days to file an amended cross-complaint.
