Legal
Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”)
section 1987.1 states that “[i]f a subpoena requires the attendance of a
witness or the production of books, documents, electronically stored
information, or other things before a court, or at the trial of an issue
therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon motion reasonably
made by any person described in subdivision (b), or upon the court’s own motion
after giving counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard, may make an order
quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it
upon those terms or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective
orders.”  (CCP § 1987.1(a).)  “In addition, the court may make any
other order as may be appropriate to protect the person from unreasonable or
oppressive demands, including unreasonable violations of the right of privacy
of the person.”  (Id.)  
   
As a general rule, all unprivileged
information that is relevant to the subject matter of the action is
discoverable if it would itself be admissible evidence at trial or if it
appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
(CCP § 2017.010; Schnabel v. Superior Court (1993) 5 Cal.4th 704,
711.) Information is relevant if it might reasonably assist a party in
evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement. (Gonzalez
v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546.)
 
Subpoenas which seek consumer
records, including personal financial information, must adhere to additional
procedural requirements laid out in CCP § 1985.3.  The subpoena must first
be served on the consumer at least five days before it is served on the
nonparty from whom records are sought (with a five-day extension if served by
mail, pursuant to CCP § 1013). (CCP, § 1985.3(b)(3).) A subpoena must
be served on the custodian of records at least fifteen days before the date
upon which records are to be produced, plus any statutory extensions. (Id.,
§§ 1985.3(d), 2020.410(c).)
 
CCP section¿2025.410(c) requires
that a motion to quash a deposition notice must be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration.  Additionally, a motion to quash production of
documents at a deposition must be accompanied by a separate statement setting
forth the particular documents or demands at issue and the factual and legal
reasons why production should not be compelled.  (CRC rule 3.1345(a)(5).)

Plaintiffs’ request for judicial
notice is GRANTED. (Evid. Code § 452(c).)

Horizon Holding Group; 9920
Holding LLC; 9920 Management LLC; IY International Inc.;
Clisen EOW Inc; Inspire Lab; Lux
International Group; and LUX (Cayman) Limited (collectively
“Defendants”) move to quash fourteen separate subpoenas issued by Plaintiffs
Jinwan Shen and Da Bai Niu (collectively “Plaintiffs”) to various banking
institutions and CPA firms.
 
First, Defendants claim that no
notice to consumer was served as to subpoena nos. 1, 2, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, and
14. “Prior to the date called for in the subpoena duces tecum for the
production of personal records, the subpoenaing party shall serve or cause to
be served on the consumer whose records are being sought a copy of the subpoena
duces tecum, of the affidavit supporting the issuance of the subpoena, if any,
and of the notice described in subdivision (c), and proof of service[.]” (CCP §
1985.3(b).) “‘Consumer’ means any individual, partnership of five or fewer
persons, association, or trust which has transacted business with, or has used
the services of, the witness or for whom the witness has acted as agent or fiduciary.”
(CCP, § 1985.3(a)(2) Defendants argue that nos. 1, 2, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, and 14 relate
to records of an individual, trust or partnership with five or fewer persons. However,
only nos. 1 and 11-14 seek records of trust(s). Nos. 2, 7 and 8 seek records of
LLCs and/or limited companies, Sycamore Holding LLC, LUX (Caymen) Limited, and
2127 LLC. Defendants present no evidence that such companies fall into the statutory
category of consumers, i.e., that they are “partnerships of five or fewer
people.” As to the subpoenas that did require consumer notices, Plaintiff
argues that they complied with the consumer notice requirements to the “two
applicable consumer defendants” before serving the subpoenas. Plaintiff,
however, does not provide any evidence of this notice or how such notice would
be effective as to subpoena nos. 1 and 11-14. Thus, subpoena nos. 1 and 11-14 will
be quashed.
 
As to the remaining subpoenas (nos.
2-10), Defendants argue that they invade their rights to privacy. The requests
seek the following categories:
 
Subpoena no. 2: All documents,
including but not limited to all account statements, canceled checks, deposit
slips, withdrawal slips, wire transfers, wire memos, debit memos, mortgages,

The party asserting a privacy right
must establish a legally protected privacy interest, an objectively reasonable
expectation of privacy in the given circumstances, and a threatened intrusion
that is serious. (Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn.
(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 35-37.) The party seeking information may raise, in
response, whatever legitimate and important countervailing interests disclosure
serves, while the party seeking protection may identify feasible alternatives
that serve the same interests or protective measures that would diminish the
loss of privacy. (Id. at 37–40.) 
 
If there is a serious invasion of a
constitutional right to privacy, the party seeking the evidence must establish
that the information sought is not only essential and directly relevant, but
also that this information could not be discovered through less intrusive
means. (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 552.) In
considering a privacy objection, trial courts must carefully balance a right of
privacy against the interest in having just litigation. (Pioneer Electronics
(USA), Inc. v. Superior Court (2007) 40 Cal.4th 360, 371.); Allen v.
Superior Court (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 447, 449; see, e.g., Valley Bank of
Nevada v. Superior Court (1975) 15 Cal.3d 652, 658 [“. . . the
purpose of the information sought, the effect that disclosure will have on the parties
and on the trial, the nature of the objections urged by the party resisting
disclosure, and ability of the court to make an alternative order which may
grant partial disclosure, disclosure in another form, or disclosure only in the
event that the party seeking the information undertakes certain specified
burdens which appear just under the circumstances.”].) The burden is on the
party seeking the constitutionally protected information to establish direct
relevance.  (Harris v. Superior Court (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 661,
665.)  
 
Corporations enjoy no right to
financial privacy under the United States Constitution. (United States v.
Morton Salt Co. (1950) 338 U.S. 632, 652  [“[C]orporations can claim
no equality with individuals in the enjoyment of a right to privacy”]; see also
First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti (1978) 435 U.S. 765,
778-79 n.14  [“Corporate identity has been determinative in several
decisions denying corporations certain constitutional rights, such as . . .
equality with individuals in the enjoyment of a right to privacy[.]”].)
Likewise, they enjoy no right to financial privacy under the California
Constitution: “The [California] constitutional provision [concerning the right
to privacy] simply does not apply to corporations. The provision protects the
privacy rights of people.” (Roberts v. Gulf Oil Corp. (1983) 147
Cal. App. 3d 770, 791.) The corporate right to privacy is a lesser right
than that held by human beings and is not considered a fundamental
right. (Ameri-Medical Corp. v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Board (1996)
42 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1287-1288.) Because the corporate privacy right is not
constitutionally protected, the issue presented in determining whether the
requests for production infringe that right is resolved by a balancing test. (Hecht,
Solberg, Robinson, Goldberg & Bagley v. Superior Court (2006) 137
Cal.App.4th 579, 594-595.) The discovery's relevance to the subject matter of
the pending dispute and whether the discovery appears reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence is balanced against the corporate
right of privacy. (Ibid.) Doubts about relevance generally are resolved
in favor of permitting discovery. (Ibid.) 


Defendant Li claims financial privacy
in his requested records in subpoenas 9 and 10. Subpoena nos. 9 and 10 seek any
and all documents, including financial and banking records, relating to Li. Li,
as an individual, has a legally protected privacy interest and an objectively
reasonable expectation of privacy in his individual banking records. Disclosure
of “all” such records threaten a serious intrusion into his privacy. As to nos.
2-8, there is no serious invasion of the constitutional right to privacy as to the
single purpose entities.  
 
Plaintiffs show direct relevancy to
their claims and that no less intrusive means exist to discover the relevant
information, to wit, evidence of Li’s misappropriation of the subject funds. Generally,
the FAC states that Defendants misappropriated Plaintiffs’ funds in the
approximate amount of $84,000,000. The FAC alleges that Plaintiffs were induced
by Li to transfer the funds so that Li could then use the funds to set up
business ventures in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino.
Plaintiffs contributed 70% and Li contributed 30% of capital in their joint venture.
Defendants allegedly diverted from the business ventures or squandered the
funds for his own purposes using the various entity defendants. (See FAC ¶¶ 69,
97, 137, 138, 150, 151, 154, 169, 181, 194, 201, 209, 216, 228, 236, 239-244.) For
example, Plaintiffs show transfers of $22 million to Clisen (Lee Decl., Exs. 2,
3, 4), funds transferred from the Lincoln trust to Apple Blossom (Ex. 5), an
unauthorized $22 million credit line with Lincoln Irrevocable Trust (Exs. 6-7),
a $11 million unauthorized transfer to Sycamore Holding LLC (Ex. 8), a $350,000
transfer to Lux International Group (Ex. 9), and other money transfers (Exs.
10-11). Plaintiffs present the October 2023 Summary Report by Defendant Li.
(Lee Decl., Ex. 1.) During the 22-plus days of in person meetings and
thereabouts, Defendant Li did not produce any evidence that he contributed his
30% joint venture funds as required under their agreements. (Id.; FAC ¶¶ 68-69,
97, 137, 138, 150, 151, 154, 169, 181, 194, 201, 209, 216, 228, 236, 239-24.) Defendant
Li allegedly had sole control and directly withdrew/transferred funds from
accounts for his personal gain. Under the pled theory, Plaintiffs will need to
uncover where their funds went, and how such funds were spent. Accordingly, the
subject subpoenas seeking Defendants’ bank, accounting, and related financial
records are directly relevant to trace where and how Defendants dissipated the
funds. 
 
Accordingly, the motions are GRANTED
as to subpoena nos. 2-10 and DENIED as to subpoena nos. 1 and 11-14. In light
of the mixed results of the motions, the court does not award reasonable
expenses incurred in making or opposing the motions. (CCP § 1987.2(a).)
