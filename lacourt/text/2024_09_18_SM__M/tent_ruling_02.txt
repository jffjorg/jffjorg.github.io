LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (CCP §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the
factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28
Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the
construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore
Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations
omitted.) 
 
A special demurrer for uncertainty is
disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that
defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what
issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed
against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat
vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)  
 
Any party, within the time allowed to
respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole
or any part thereof. (CCP § 435(b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1322(b).)
The court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it
deems proper: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (CCP §§ 436(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767,
782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage;
probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].) 
 
“Liberality in permitting amendment is
the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to show¿in
what manner¿plaintiff can amend the complaint, and¿how¿that
amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.¿(Id.)  
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Sunbelt Rentals Inc. demurs and moves
to strike portions of Defendant/Cross-Complainant Void Studios LLC’s operative
First Amended Cross-Complaint (“FACC”). The FACC states three causes of action
for 1) Fraudulent Misrepresentation; 2) Breach of Contract; and 3) Violation of
Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq.
 
First
Cause of Action for Fraudulent Misrepresentation
 
The
elements of fraud are: “(a) misrepresentation (false representation,
concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c)
intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e)
resulting damage.” (Charnay v. Cobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 184.)
In California, fraud must be pled with specificity. (Small v. Fritz
Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184.) “The particularity demands
that a plaintiff plead facts which show how, when, where, to whom, and by what
means the representations were tendered.” (Cansino v. Bank of America
(2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1469.) “[T]hat is, a plaintiff must plead facts
that show with particularity the elements of the cause of action.” (Glaski
v. Bank of Am., Nat'l Ass’n (2013) 218 Cal. App. 4th 1079, 1090.) In the
case of a corporate defendant, the plaintiff must also allege the names of the
persons who made the allegedly fraudulent representations and their authority
to speak on behalf of the corporate defendant. (Blickman Turkus, LP v. MF
Downtown Sunnyvale, LLC (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 858, 878.) In addition,
damages must be alleged distinctly and their “causal connection with the
reliance on the representations must be shown.” (Service by Medallion v.
Clorox Co. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1807, 1818.)
 
The
FACC alleges that on May 2022, SRI’s representatives made
unspecified representations about the effectiveness of its 20-ton HVAC units
(“20T Units”) for use in the environmental cooling of a commercial studio space.
Based on such representations, VS entered into the subject agreement with SRI
to provide the 20T Units, with costs of $5,600.00 per month. (FACC ¶ 4.)
VS had issues with the 20T Units right after
installation in May 2022, and it became
apparent that the units were not effectively
cooling the building. (¶ 5.) VS informed SRI of the ineffectiveness. (Id.) Representatives
from SRI suggested replacing the 20T Units, which were external, with 12-Ton
Units (“12T Units”), which were to be installed inside the building to mitigate
the issues with air heating up inside the Studio Space. (¶ 6.) The SRI
representatives further represented that because the 12T Units were smaller, the
cost would decrease or at least remain at the
same level as agreed upon initially (i.e., $5,600). (¶ 7.) SRI also promised to
remove the 20T Units since the 12T Units were to take their place. (Id.)
Relying on this recommendation, VS agreed to the replacement. (¶¶ 6, 8.) SRI
installed 12T Units in July 2022 and promised to remove the 20T Units. (¶ 8.) 
 
Contrary to representations made by SRI, SRI not only charged
more for than the agreed-upon cost-rate for the 12T Units, SRI also failed to
remove the 20T Units and continued to bill for those units, effectively double-billing.
(FACC ¶ 9.) The new units were just as ineffective at cooling the studio space.
(¶ 10.) VS lost two clients and contracts as a result of the excessive heat
within the studio space. (¶ 11.) SRI’s sales agents and employees made the representations,
but never intended to keep its promises of those rates. (¶ 14.)
 
The above allegations do not rise to the level of specificity
required for pleading fraud. Here, the FACC only identifies “sales agents and
employees” as making vague representations regarding the effectiveness of the 20T
Units, that the replacement 12T Units would mitigate the air heating issues,
that the monthly costs would remain at least at the same level, and that SRI
would remove the 20T Units. Such allegations do not establish how, when, where,
to whom and by what means the representations were tendered. Thus, further
facts are required to establish the fraud cause of action.
 
Accordingly, the demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend as to
this cause of action.
 
Second
Cause of Action for Breach of Contract
SRI argues that the second
cause of action fails because it does not allege whether the contract is
written, oral or implied.
“The essential elements
of a claim of breach of contract, whether express or implied, are the contract,
plaintiff's performance or excuse for nonperformance, defendant's breach, and
the resulting damages to plaintiff.” (San Mateo Union High School Dist. v.
County of San Mateo (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 418, 439.) Interpretation of a
contract can be a matter of law for the court. (Parsons v. Bristol
Development Co. (1965) 62 Cal.2d 861, 865.) CCP section 430.10(g) requires
a complaint “founded upon a contract” to state “whether the contract is
written, is oral, or is implied by conduct.”
Indeed,
the FACC does not allege any specific facts showing that the subject agreement
was written, oral or implied by conduct. The FACC alleges in
May 2022, the parties entered into an agreement for SRI to provide
the 20T Units to VS at a monthly rate of $5,600.00 per month. (FACC ¶4.)
The parties apparently renegotiated the contract, agreeing to replace the 20T
Units with 12T Units, while keeping the monthly rates the same as initially
agreed. (¶¶ 5-8.) SRI breached its agreement to provide
rates on the 12T Units matching the 20T Units, to remove the 20T Units, and the
stated purposes underlying the contract and installation of both units. (FACC ¶
14.) The FACC furthermore alleges that breached its agreement by double-billing
for the 12T Units and the 20T Units. (Id.) While the FACC alleges the general
existence of a contract, the FACC does not clearly state whether the contract
was written, oral or implied by conduct. 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
Third
Cause of Action for Violations of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200
 
The FACC alleges that SRI engaged in unlawful, unfair, and fraudulent
business practices and unfair competition in violation of Business and Professions
Code § 17200 et seq. when engaging in the above noted conduct. (¶20.)
However, as discussed, the fraud and breach of contract causes of action fail
to state a claim. For the same reasons, there is no factual basis to conclude
that SRI engaged in unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business practices as
defined by section 17200.
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
 
The
motion to strike is moot.
 
Void
has 30 days to file an amended cross-complaint.
