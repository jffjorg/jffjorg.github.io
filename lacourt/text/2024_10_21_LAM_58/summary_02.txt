Here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for default judgment against Defendant Richard Towne without prejudice. The court previously denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment because the plaintiff failed to file a request for dismissal as to all other parties in the case and failed to prove proof of service of a Statement of Damages on Defendant Towne prior to the entry of default. The court also noted that the plaintiff's requested damages were unsubstantiated because he failed to establish a prima facie case for the damages sought.

The plaintiff now moves for default judgment against Defendant Richard Towne, seeking damages in the amount of $67,813.33. The court observes that the plaintiff has properly filed a request for dismissal as to all other parties in the case and has submitted a declaration that establishes the basis for his sought damages. However, the court still finds that the plaintiff failed to prove service of a Statement of Damages on Defendant Towne prior to the entry of default, and therefore declines to enter default judgment.

The court notes that the plaintiff's declaration in support of default judgment properly substantiates the damages he seeks, including $7,813.33 in special damages and $60,000.00 in general damages. The court concludes that the plaintiff has established a prima facie case for pain and emotional suffering damages because Defendant Towne's minimal recovery of $2,933.33 was insufficient based on the plaintiff's inability to work, and the plaintiff suffered emotional distress because Defendant Towne failed to honor even this minimal recovery.

The court resets the hearing on the plaintiff's motion for entry of default judgment to a later date if the plaintiff submits a proof of service of the Statement of Damages on Defendant Towne.
