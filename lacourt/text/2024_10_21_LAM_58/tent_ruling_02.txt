Tentative
Ruling:      Order to Show Cause
re: Plaintiff’s Motion for Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice
 

 
BACKGROUND
 
This is an action arising from
legal malpractice. The Complaint alleges a single cause of action for
negligence.
 
On November 8, 2023, the court
entered default against Defendant Richard Towne (Doe 1) in the amount of
$204,880.00, including $4,880.00 in special damages and $200,000.00 in general
damages.
 
On February 26, 2024, the Court
denied Plaintiff’s request for default judgment because (1) Plaintiff failed to
file a request for entry of dismissal as to all other parties in the case, (Nicholson
v. Henderson (1944) 25 Cal.2d 375, 378; Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a)(7)), and (2) although the Complaint did not specify the amount of
damages sought, Plaintiff failed to prove proof of service of a Statement of
Damages on Defendant Towne prior to the entry of default, as required by Code
of Civil Procedure section 425.11. 
 
In addition, the Court noted that
Plaintiff’s requested damages were unsubstantiated because he failed to
establish a prima facie case for the damages sought. (Harbour Vista, LLC v.
HSBC Mortg. Services Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 288.) The Court could
not award damages in the amount sought, even if the procedural requirements for
default judgment had been met, because Plaintiff’s only evidence supporting the
request for $200,000.00 in general damages was entirely conclusory and lacked
foundation. (Kim v. Westmoore Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267,
288; Taliaferro v. Hoogs (1963) 219 Cal.App.2d 559, 560, citing CCP §
585.) 
 
Plaintiff now moves for default
judgment against Defendant Richard Towne. The request for entry of default
judgment is denied.

DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff
seeks default judgment in the amount of $67,813.33 against Defendant Towne,
which includes $7,813.33 in special damages, and $60,000.00 in general damages.
 
            First, the
Court observes that, on May 13, 2024, Plaintiff properly filed a request for
dismissal as to Defendants Leslie Richards, the Law Offices of Leslie Richards,
and Does 2 to 5. This complies with the Court’s first noted deficiency in
Plaintiff’s prior request for default judgment.
 
            Further,
the Court also notes that the Declaration of Dario Herrera in Support of
Default Judgment properly substantiates the damages he seeks. 
 
First, Plaintiff provides proper
foundation for the $7,813.33 in special damages sought. Plaintiff states that
Defendant Towne provided him a $2,933.33 check, representing the total sum Defendant
Towne recovered for Plaintiff, but that Plaintiff was not able to withdraw these
funds when he attempted to cash the check. (Herrera Decl., ¶¶ 2, 4-5, Exh. 1.) Plaintiff
also establishes that he incurred $4,880.00 in medical expenses because of the underlying
incident for the case Defendant Towne represented him on, but that Defendant
Towne never inquired about these expenses and did not recover them. (Id.,
¶ 3-5, 7 Exh. 2.)
 
Second, Plaintiff provides proper
foundation for the $60,000.00 in general damages sought. Plaintiff states that
Defendant Towne’s malpractice caused him to “suffer[] [a] great deal of
emotional distress and pain, suffering and inconvenience.” (Herrera Decl., ¶
6.) Plaintiff establishes a prima facie case for pain and emotional suffering damages
because Defendant Towne’s minimal recovery of $2,933.33 was insufficient based
on Plaintiff’s inability to work. (Id., ¶ 2, 5, Exh. 2.) Plaintiff
further provides he suffered emotional distress because Defendant failed to
honor even this minimal recovery. (Ibid.) These facts demonstrate a
valid basis for recovery of emotional distress damages. 
 
However, the Court declines to
enter default judgment as to Defendant Towne because Plaintiff, as with his
prior request for entry of default judgment, failed to prove service of a
Statement of Damages on Defendant Towne prior to the entry of default. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 425.11.) In connection with Plaintiff’s amended request for entry
of default judgment, he submitted a declaration that establishes the basis for
his sought damages. However, neither this declaration, nor any papers filed in
Plaintiff’s prove-up package, suggests compliance with the required service on
Defendant Towne. As the Court previously held, this noncompliance is fatal to
the request for default judgment.
 
Second, Plaintiff’s evidence
submitted in support of judgment requested in the filing named “Declaration in
Support of Entry of Judgment CCP § 585(d)” is not properly signed under penalty
of perjury. This is the only filing that incorporates the exhibit containing
Defendant’s agreement with Plaintiff. The declaration states only that it
incorporates by attachment a separate declaration in support of judgment. Such
separate declaration was “signed and subscribed” before a “Notary Public-State
of South Carolina.” However, it states only “I affirm under penalty of perjury
that the above facts are true and correct.” Because this declaration was
apparently signed outside of California, this verification is not in compliance
with the requirement that the declaration be expressly made “under penalty of
perjury under the laws of the state of California.” (CCP §2015.5; Kulshrestha
v. First Union Commercial Corp. (2004) 33 Cal. 4th 601, 618.) 
 
CONCLUSION
            
The Court issues the following
ruling, in the alternative.
 
            If
Plaintiff submits a Proof of Service of the Statement of Damages on Defendant
Towne, the Court will consider the amended request for entry of default
judgment.
 
            Otherwise, Plaintiff’s
Motion for Entry of Default Judgment is DENIED without prejudice. Accordingly,
the Court resets the Hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion for Entry of Default
Judgment to such later date as will be decided.
