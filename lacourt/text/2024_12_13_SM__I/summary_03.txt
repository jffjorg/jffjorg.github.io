And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered three unopposed motions to compel and one request to deem responses admitted. The motions to compel are granted, and the parties are ordered to serve verified code-compliant responses without objection, except for privilege, within 30 days. If a privilege objection is made, a detailed log will be served at the same time. Documents will also be produced at the same time. The motion to deem admitted is granted unless responses were served before the hearing, in which case the court orders the responses to be re-served without objection within 5 court days. A sanction of $2115 is imposed on the defendant for failing to oppose the motions, but not on counsel. The court warns that if the defendant fails to comply with the order, it may impose further sanctions.
