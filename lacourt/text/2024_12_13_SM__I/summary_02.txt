And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the unopposed motion to compel, requiring the defendant to serve verified responses to discovery requests and produce documents without objection, except for privileged information, within 30 days. The defendant must also provide a detailed log of any documents withheld on the basis of privilege. The judge has imposed sanctions of $3120 on the defendant for failing to comply with discovery requests, but has not imposed sanctions on the defendant's counsel. The sanctions are reduced because the motions are essentially identical and no opposition was filed.
