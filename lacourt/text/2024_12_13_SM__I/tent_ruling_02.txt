 Case Number:  24SMCV00939    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2024    Dept:  I The unopposed motion to compel is GRANTED.  Defendant will serve verified responses to
the discovery without objection other than privilege within 30 days.  If any document is withheld on the basis of
privilege, a detailed log will be served at the same time.  The log will be detailed enough to be a prima
facie showing of privilege. 
Documents will be produced at the same time.  Sanctions in the amount of $3120 for both
motions is imposed on defendant, but not counsel, payable within 30 days.  The reduced amount is because the motions are
essentially identical and no opposition was filed (meaning no time was needed
to review it and no time to submit a reply was required).
