 Case Number:  24SMCV02713    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2024    Dept:  I The court has before it three unopposed motions to compel
and one request to deem RFA’s to be admitted. 
The motions are GRANTED.  As to
the motions to compel, verified code-compliant responses without objection
other than privilege will be served within 30 days.  If a privilege objection is made, a detailed
log will be served at the same time setting forth enough information to make a prima
facie showing of privilege. 
Documents will be produced at the same time.  As to the motion to deem admitted, unless
responses were served before the hearing the motion is GRANTED and the RFA’s
will be deemed admitted.  If responses
were served, the court ORDERS that code-compliant responses be re-served
without objection within 5 court days unless there are no objections in the
responses and defendant believes that the responses are already
code-compliant.  In the latter case,
however, if a motion to compel further is brought and granted, the court will
view the defense as having violated this order, and sanctions other than
monetary sanctions will be on the table. 
Sanctions in the amount of $2115 are imposed against the defendant, but
not counsel, payable within 30 days.  The
reduced sanction amount is because the motions are essentially identical and
the lack of any opposition means that no time was spent reviewing the
oppositions or preparing a reply.
