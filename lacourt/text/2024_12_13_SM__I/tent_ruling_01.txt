  Case Number:  22SMCV00598    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here on an interesting motion to compel
further responses.  The underlying issue
dealt with discovery propounded by plaintiff to defendant seeking certain
documents.  Defendant objected to much of
the production on the basis of attorney/client privilege or attorney work product.  Plaintiff’s position is that counsel was not
providing legal advice to the client, but rather was acting as the adjuster,
which, if true, would mean that the documents would not be immune from
discovery.  The court held an earlier
hearing on September 13, 2024.  At that
hearing, the court issued a very long tentative.  The court ordered the defense to submit a
detailed privilege log identifying any document not being produced on the basis
of privilege (except documents created after the start of litigation, documents
between counsel and Galloway and no one else, documents that have been produced
in redacted form and where the not redacted material would not be on the log,
and documents between the attorney and people at FFIC and no one else but FFIC
will keep a list of individuals involved and the parties will meet and confer
on the list).  The log was to be produced
by October 18, 2024.  The matter was
continued to today.  No further briefing
has been filed (or was required). 
 
The court will inquire of the parties.  The court is hopeful that the dispute has
been resolved, or at least narrowed.  The
court will, after hearing from counsel, decide what, if any, additional orders
or procedures are needed.
