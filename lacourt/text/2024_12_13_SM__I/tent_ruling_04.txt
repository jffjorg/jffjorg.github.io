 Case Number:  SC128659    Hearing Date:   December 13, 2024    Dept:  I The applications are DENIED. 
The application to limit Pomerantz to a recovery of $25,000 on the
contract is a disguised untimely in limine motion.  It is not proper.  Further, Pomerantz argues that Buckley
breached first, thereby relieving him of his agreement to reduce the fee (and
also that any such agreement was a nullity because it was not in writing).  Whether Pomerantz was excused from his
promise will be for the jury to decide. 
Nor will the court start setting hearings on 3-300 violations.  This is not the State Bar Court.  The court has no jurisdiction to impose
discipline on an attorney.  Of course, by
so stating, the court is not suggesting that if it did have the jurisdiction,
it might so find.  The court is merely
saying that the application never made it out of the starting gate. 
 
The good news is that the court is confident that Buckley
will not make any claims of illness, computer glitches, or other emergencies
that stop him from complying fully and completely with the court’s FSC
orders.  If he has enough time to do
this, then he has enough time for that.
