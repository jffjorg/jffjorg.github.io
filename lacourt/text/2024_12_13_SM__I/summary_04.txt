And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the application to limit Pomerantz's recovery to $25,000 on the contract. The judge considers this application to be a disguised untimely motion and therefore improper. Additionally, the judge will not set hearings on 3-300 violations, as this is outside the court's jurisdiction. The judge notes that the court lacks authority to impose discipline on attorneys and that any decision on whether Pomerantz was excused from promising to reduce his fee will be left to the jury. The judge expresses confidence that the defendant, Buckley, will comply fully with the court's orders without making excuses for lack of time or other emergencies.
