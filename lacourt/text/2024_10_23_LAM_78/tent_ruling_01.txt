  Case Number:  22STCV15958    Hearing Date:   October 23, 2024    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78 ¿ ADRIANA RENOVATO, Plaintiff(s), vs. CARTERS INC., et al., Defendant(s). Case No.: 22STCV15958 Hearing Date: October 23, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO TAX COSTS  I. BACKGROUND On May 13, 2022, plaintiff Adriana Renovato (“Plaintiff”) filed this FEHA action against defendants Carters Inc., Carters Retail Inc., Lisa Quibilan, and Does 1 through 100, alleging discrimination and harassment based on gender, marital status, and disability. The complaint sets forth fourteen causes of action for (1) Breach of Express Written Contract; (2) Breach of Implied Contract; (3) Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (4) Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy; (5) Discrimination; (6) Retaliation; (7) Harassment; (8) Violation of Cal. Labor Code §230.8; (9) Violation of Cal. Labor Code §1102.5; (10) Violation of Cal. Labor Code §1198.5; (11) Fraudulent Inducement; (12) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (“IIED”); (13) Violation of Business & Professions Code §17200; and (14) Violation of CLRA.¿ On August 2, 2024, the Court entered judgment in favor of defendants Carters Inc., Carters Retail Inc., and Lisa Quibilan’s (collectively, “Defendants”) pursuant to the granting of their motion for summary judgment against Plaintiff’s complaint. On August 30, 2024, Defendants filed a Motion for Costs and the Memorandum of Costs. On September 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Tax Costs. On October 10, 2024, Defendants filed an opposition. On October 16, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.  II. LEGAL STANDARD In general, the prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc., §1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott Co. of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.)¿ At the same time, the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, enacted at Government Code sections 12900-12996, provides that “[i]n civil actions brought under [FEHA], the court, in its discretion, may award to the prevailing party . . . reasonable attorney's fees and costs . . . except that, notwithstanding [a different Code section not at issue here], a prevailing defendant shall not be awarded fees and costs unless the court finds the action was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless when brought, or the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.” (Gov. Code, § 12965, subd. (b).)¿ “Government Code section 12965, subdivision (b), governs cost awards in FEHA actions, allowing trial courts discretion in awards of both attorney fees and costs to prevailing FEHA parties.” (Williams v. Chino Valley Independent Fire District (2015) 61 Cal.4th 97, 99.) Although Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b) broadly mandates that costs be awarded to the prevailing party in civil actions, our Supreme Court in Williams made abundantly clear that Government Code section 12965(b) is an “express exception to Code of Civil Procedure section 1032(b)” in actions governed by FEHA. (Id. at 109.)¿ “Because the majority of cases under the FEHA involve litigants who would not have the financial means to prosecute this type of case, the public policy behind the FEHA is served by not discouraging them from pursuing the litigation by potentially imposing fees that could easily devastate them financially simply because a few file frivolous claims. Thus, a plaintiff’s ability to pay must be considered before awarding attorney fees in favor of the defendant.” (Villanueva v. City of Colton (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1188, 1203.) “[A]n award of attorney fees should not subject the plaintiff to financial ruin.” (Rosenman v. Christensen, Miller, Fink, Jacobs, Glaser, Weil & Shapiro (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 859, 868.)  III. DISCUSSION “Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum… If the cost memorandum was served electronically, the period is extended as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6(a)(4).” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700(b)(1).) The cost memorandum was electronically served on August 29, 2024. The instant motion to tax costs was filed and served on September 17, 2024 and is therefore timely.¿ It is undisputed that Plaintiff’s claims are FEHA based such that the section 12965(b) express exception should apply. However, as Plaintiff asserts, under section 12965(b), a successful FEHA defendant is awarded costs only if “the action was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless when brought, or [if] the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.” (Gov. Code, § 12965, subd. (b).) If neither of these is the case, Defendants may not be awarded their costs.  Plaintiff contends the cost memorandum must be stricken in its entirety because Defendants engaged in settlement discussions, did not argue that Plaintiff’s claims were frivolous in their MSJ, and did not file any motion claiming the Complaint was frivolous. Plaintiff argues her case was meritorious on many issues and that her opposition had merit. In opposition, Defendants contend Plaintiff litigated this matter in a haphazard and dilatory manner, and that there was no legal basis for this action. In reply, Plaintiff reasserts that there is no evidence that her action was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless. The Court cannot say that Plaintiff’s action was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless when brought or that Plaintiff continued to litigate the action after it clearly became so, because the granting of the MSJ was not based entirely on the merits of Plaintiff’s action. Plaintiff, at the time she opposed the MSJ, did not present all the evidence she could have that may have potentially affected the outcome of Defendants’ MSJ. The Hon. Jill Feeney continued Defendants’ MSJ on February 15, 2024 to August 2, 2024 in response to Plaintiff’s opposition, at the time, seeking a continuance to take the depositions of Quibilan, Gage, and Defendants’ PMQ. However, despite this, Plaintiff failed to proceed with the depositions before fact discovery closed nor did Plaintiff seek to reopen discovery or file any motions to compel in the interim. Aside from not having the deposition transcripts of Quibilan, Gage, and Defendants’ PMQ to oppose the MSJ, there were also issues with the separate statement and the opposition failing to argue against the substance of Defendants’ MSJ.  In determining whether an action was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless such that an award of costs is appropriate, “it is important that a . . . court resist the understandable temptation to engage in post hoc reasoning by concluding that, because a plaintiff did not ultimately prevail, his action must have been unreasonable or without foundation. This kind of hindsight logic could discourage all but the most airtight claims, for seldom can a prospective plaintiff be sure of ultimate success.” (Rosenman v. Christensen, Miller, Fink, Jacobs, Glaser, Weil, & Shapiro (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 859, 895 [analyzing identical language applicable to Title VII claims]; see also Williams, supra, 61 Cal.4th at pp. 113 [embracing the “asymmetrical” nature of section 12965(b)’s costs provision in light of the Legislature’s express intent “to encourage persons injured by discrimination to seek judicial relief”].)  Thus, because the Court did not have all the evidence identified before it in order to fully evaluate the matter on the merits, the Court cannot find that Plaintiff’s lawsuit was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless or that Plaintiff continued to litigate in such a way that awarding costs would be appropriate. “In amending [FEHA] to authorize discretionary awards of attorney fees and costs, our Legislature, like Congress before it, sought ‘to encourage persons injured by discrimination to seek judicial relief.’ [Citation.]” (Williams, supra, (2015) 61 Cal.4th at p. 112.) In order to vindicate the intent of our Legislature, the striking or taxing of costs in this case is appropriate. (Assem. Off. of Research, 3d reading analysis of Assem. Bill. No. 1959 (1977-1978 Reg. Sess.) as amended Jan. 18, 1978, p. 1.)  IV. CONCLUSION Plaintiff’s motion to tax costs is GRANTED. Defendants shall not recover their costs in this action.¿  Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: October 22, 2024 __________________________ Hon. Michelle C.
