`Significant Statements`:
  - "Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum…"
  - "It is important that a . . . court resist the understandable temptation to engage in post hoc reasoning by concluding that, because a plaintiff did not ultimately prevail, his action must have been unreasonable or without foundation."
  - "In amending [FEHA] to authorize discretionary awards of attorney fees and costs, our Legislature, like Congress before it, sought ‘to encourage persons injured by discrimination to seek judicial relief.’"
  - "In order to vindicate the intent of our Legislature, the striking or taxing of costs in this case is appropriate."
