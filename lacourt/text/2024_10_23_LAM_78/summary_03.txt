Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to vacate the order compelling arbitration and lift the stay. The plaintiff, Patrick Martin, had filed a motion seeking to vacate the order compelling arbitration and lift the stay, alleging that the defendants, California Cemetery and Funeral Services, LLC, et al., had materially breached the arbitration agreement. The plaintiff claimed that he had paid $400 for a Demand for Arbitration with Judicial Arbitration and Mediations Services (JAMS) and that the defendants had refused to pay for the arbitration.

The defendants argued that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) preempts Code Civ. Proc. §1281.97 and that the plaintiff's counsel had stopped substantively engaging in negotiations. The defendants also claimed that the plaintiff's counsel had unilaterally selected an arbitration service provider without following the procedures outlined in the Mutual Resolution Process Agreement (MRPA).

The judge found that the plaintiff's counsel had not followed the procedures outlined in the MRPA and that the plaintiff's counsel had unilaterally selected an arbitration service provider. Therefore, the judge denied the motion to vacate the order compelling arbitration and lift the stay.
