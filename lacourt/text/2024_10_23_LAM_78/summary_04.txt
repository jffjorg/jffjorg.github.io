And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying without prejudice the Petition for Approval for Transfer of Payment Rights filed by J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC on behalf of Angela Johnson. The Petition seeks approval for the transfer of structured settlement payments resulting from a personal injury claim. The Judge finds that the Petitioner has not satisfied the requirements of Insurance Code section 10139.5, which requires that the transfer be in the best interest of the payee, that the payee has been advised in writing to seek independent professional advice, that the transferee has complied with the notification requirements, and that the payee understands the terms of the transfer agreement. The Judge notes that the Petitioner has provided a California Statement of Professional Representation signed by Payee, indicating that Petitioner advised Payee to seek independent professional advice, but notes that there is no declaration from Payee providing any information to determine whether the transfer is in Payee's best interest. The Judge orders the Petitioner to give notice and to file a declaration from Payee to support the petition.
