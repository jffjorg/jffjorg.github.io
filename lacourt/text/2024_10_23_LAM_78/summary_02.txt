And here is the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion to set aside the judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The defendants claimed that they did not receive notice of the trial date and that the plaintiff should have known about their new address. The plaintiff argued that the defendants received multiple notices of the trial date, including at the Case Management Conference, and that they could have checked the court docket to confirm the trial date.

The Judge found that the defendants' lack of notice argument was not persuasive, as they had been informed of the trial date at the Case Management Conference and could have easily confirmed the trial date by checking the court docket. The Judge also noted that the plaintiff's service of notices at the erroneous address of "813 East Washington" or at the address no longer occupied by the defendants was harmless error under the circumstances.

Accordingly, the Judge has denied the defendants' motion to set aside the judgment and has ordered that the parties meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
