Background
 
This action arises from the alleged breach
of a contract pertaining to legal services. On November 16, 2023, Plaintiff
Christie Kim Professional Law Corporation (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint in
this action. 
 
On March 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
operative First Amended Complaint against Defendants Pacific Coast Trial Law
Firm (“Pacific Coast”) and Tongdan Xue alleging causes of action for: (1)
Breach of Contract; (2) Interference with Contract; (3) Promissory Estoppel
(Quantum Meruit); (4) Conversion; and (5) Unjust Enrichment. 
 
On April 15, 2024, pursuant to a
Request for Dismissal, Defendant Pacific Coast was dismissed from this action
without prejudice.  
 
On May 20, 2024, Defendant Tongdan
Xue (“Defendant”) filed the instant demurrer to the first, third, fourth, and
fifth causes of action in the FAC, as well as a motion to strike portions of
the FAC. 
 
On July 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed
respective oppositions to the demurrer and motion to strike, to which Defendant
replied on July 8, 2024. 
 
Plaintiff’s respective oppositions to
the demurrer and motion to strike were filed and served late. The oppositions
should have been filed and served no later than nine court days prior to the
hearing, or July 1, 2024. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (d).) Although filed
and served late, the Court exercises its discretion and will consider the
untimely opposition briefs. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1300(d).) 
 
 
Legal Standard for Demurrers
 
A demurrer is an objection to a
pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the face of the
complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.¿(Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.)¿The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a
pleading “by raising questions of law.”¿(Postley v. Harvey (1984) 153
Cal.App.3d 280, 286.)¿“In the construction of a pleading, for the purpose of
determining its effect, its allegations must be liberally construed, with a
view to substantial justice between the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.)¿The
court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly
pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law . . . .”
’ ”¿ (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.)¿In applying
these standards, the court liberally construes the complaint to determine
whether a cause of action has been stated.¿(Picton v. Anderson Union High
School Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 733.) 
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave
to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The
burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be amended
successfully.  (Ibid.) “If there is any reasonable possibility
that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a
demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245.) 
 
First Amended Complaint
 
            The First
Amended Complaint (FAC) alleges:  On June
28, 2018, Plaintiff law firm and Defendant Xue executed a written contract
under which Defendant sought the legal services of Plaintiff to pursue recovery
of personal injury claims. (FAC, ¶ 9.)  Under the contract, if Defendant’s claim
settled before a lawsuit was filed, Plaintiff would receive a fee equal to one-third
of Defendant’s gross recovery. (FAC, ¶ 9.) If Defendant’s claim was resolved
after a lawsuit was filed with the court and/or any arbitration or mediation,
then Plaintiff would receive a fee equal to 40% of the gross recovery. (FAC, ¶
9.)  The contract provided that in the
event Defendant Xue discharged Plaintiff, Defendant expressly agreed that
Plaintiff shall have a lien against Defendant’s recovery for services rendered
by Plaintiff prior to discharge. (FAC, ¶ 9.) If Plaintiff was discharged when
the amount of Defendant’s recovery has been or was about to determined, then Plaintiff
was entitled to either the 33 1/3% or 40% fee. (FAC, ¶ 9.) 
 
            The
Complaint alleges that Plaintiff diligently arranged for Defendant to get
treatment, opened negotiation with the carrier, and obtained an offer of
$275,000.00 and fulfilled its duties under the contract. (FAC, ¶ 10.) Defendant
then terminated the representation and retained Pacific Coast as counsel. (FAC,
¶ 11.) The case was litigated for an additional time and settled for
approximately $400,000.00. (FAC, ¶ 11.) Plaintiff requested its fee per the
contract because when the representation was transferred, the case was about to
settle with the carrier and Plaintiff had entered into final negotiations.
(FAC, ¶12.) Defendant refused to pay the money due to Plaintiff and has not
paid any of the fee due to date. (FAC, ¶ 13.) Plaintiff alleges that it has
been damaged by Defendant’s breach in paying the amount due under the contract
for either the agreed percent of the final settlement, or the agreed percentage
of the last offer of the carrier in negotiations before representation
switched. (FAC, ¶ 14.) Plaintiff alleges that it “has been damaged by the
failure of [Defendant] to pay $91,945.46, the contingency fee due under the
terms of the contract in the situation where representation is terminated after
the case is about to settle” and costs. (FAC, ¶ 15.) 
 
First Cause of Action—Breach of Contract 
 
To state a cause of action for breach
of contract, Plaintiff must be able to establish “(1) the existence of the
contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011)
51 Cal.4th 811, 821.)
 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendant
failed to pay the fee due pursuant to the $275,000.00 offer. (FAC, ¶¶ 8-15.) The
terms of the contract articulated in the FAC, however, do not entitle Plaintiff
to a percentage of an offer. Rather, Plaintiff is entitled to a percentage of
gross recovery. Nothing in the contract entitles Plaintiff to thirty-three and
one-third percent (33 1/3%) of the $275,000.00 offer. Thus, Defendant cannot be
liable for a purported breach that was not a contractual term.  
 
However, the Court notes that the FAC
alleges that “the case was litigated for an additional time, and settled for
approximately $400,000.” (FAC, ¶ 11.) Thus, based on the terms of the contract,
Plaintiff is entitled to some percentage of the recovery.  Plaintiff explicitly alleges that when the
case was transferred, the case was about to settle. (FAC, ¶ 12.) The contract
provides that “if an attorney is discharged when the amount of a client’s
recovery has been or is about to be determined” then Plaintiff is entitled to
either 33 1/3% or 40% of Defendant’s gross recovery. (FAC, ¶ 9.) As such, Plaintiff
is entitled to a portion of Defendant’s recovery.
 
The Court therefore finds that the
first cause of action in the FAC does state a valid cause of action for breach
of contract.  The demurrer to the first
cause of action is overruled.
 
Third Cause of Action—Quantum Meruit 
 
“Quantum meruit refers to the
well-established principle that the law implies a promise to pay for services
performed under circumstances disclosing that they were not gratuitously
rendered. To recover in quantum meruit, a party need not prove the existence of
a contract, but it must show the circumstances were such that the services were
rendered under some understanding or expectation of both parties that
compensation therefor was to be made.” (Chodos
v. Borman (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 76, 96, citations and quotation marks
omitted.) “[I]n order to recover under a quantum meruit theory, a plaintiff
must establish both that he or she was acting pursuant to either an express or
implied request for such services from the defendant and that the services
rendered were intended to and did benefit the defendant.” (Day v. Alta Bates Medical Center (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 243, 248.)
 
Pursuant to the third cause of
action, Plaintiff alleges that: a contingency fee agreement was entered into to
represent Defendant, and she incurred costs on her behalf and performed
substantial work and achieved significant benefits in prosecution of the claim.
(FAC, ¶ 23.) This resulted in substantial value to Defendant and her claim
under such contract for professional services. (FAC, ¶ 23.) Plaintiff was
required to spend an extraordinary amount of time and resources in settling
Defendant’s property damage claim, in addition to corresponding with and
arranging for Defendant to acquire the professional services of medical
providers. (FAC, ¶ 23.) The prelitigation work of Defendant’s case was
completed by Plaintiff, which included the drafting and sending of a formal
demand letter and negotiating to settle Defendant’s case. (FAC, ¶ 23.) 
 
Plaintiff also alleges that before a
lawsuit was filed but after an initial offer of settlement for $275,000.00,
Defendant discharged Plaintiff and retained the services of Defendant Pacific
Coast. (FAC, ¶ 24.) Plaintiff sent a Notice of Attorney’s Lien to Defendant
Pacific Coast on March 6, 2020, for the reasonable value of Plaintiff’s
services for $91,945.46 and costs incurred. (FAC, ¶ 24.) Thereafter, Defendant
through Defendant Pacific Coast, settled her claim with the opposing party’s
insurer for $450,000.00, which Defendant Pacific Coast collected on behalf of
Defendant. (FAC, ¶ 25.) Plaintiff demanded payment “from [D]efendant’s attorney
firm for the fair and reasonable sum of $91,945.46 or the work performed and
costs incurred on [Defendant’s] behalf, from June 2018 to March 2020; but, to
date, neither the whole nor any party [sic] has been paid, and there is now due
and unpaid from Defendants to Plaintiff.” (FAC, ¶ 26.) 
 
Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged
that she did work for Defendant pursuant to a contingency fee agreement and
that such work incurred a benefit on Defendant. 
 
However, although not raised by the
parties, “[a] plaintiff may not . . . pursue or recover on a quasi-contract
claim if the parties have an enforceable agreement regarding a particular
subject matter.” (Klein v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th
1342, 1388.) A cause of action for quantum meruit “is a quasi-contract claim
for the reasonable value of services rendered.” (Jogani v. Superior Court (2008)
165 Cal.App.4th 901, 909.) A plaintiff is prohibited from alleging a
quasi-contract cause of action where a plaintiff’s “breach of contract claim [pleads]
the existence of an enforceable agreement and their [quantum meruit] claim
[does] not deny the existence or enforceability of that agreement.” (Klein
v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., supra, 202 Cal.App.4th 1342, 1389-90.) 
 
In analyzing a demurrer, the Court construes
a complaint “liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the facts
pleaded.” (Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 513, 517.) Thus, based
on the allegations of the FAC, an inference is created that Plaintiff is
alleging that Defendant breached the contract that gives rise to the third
cause of action. (FAC, ¶¶ 22-27.) In fact, the third cause of action references
the agreement between the parties. (FAC, ¶ 22.) Plaintiff, however, does not
deny the validity or existence of the agreement between the parties pursuant to
the third cause of action. (FAC, ¶¶ 22-27.) Plaintiff cannot allege a claim for
quantum meruit where Plaintiff has failed to deny the existence or
enforceability of the agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant. (Klein v.
Chevron U.S.A., Inc., supra, 202 Cal.App.4th 1342, 1389-90.) 
 
Accordingly, the demurrer to the
cause of action for quantum meruit is sustained. 
 
Fourth Cause of Action—Conversion
 
“Conversion is the wrongful exercise
of dominion over the property of another. The elements of a conversion claim
are: (1) the plaintiff’s ownership or right to possession of the property; (2)
the defendant’s conversion by a wrongful act or disposition of property rights;
and (3) damages.” (Lee v. Hanley
(2015) 61 Cal.4th 1225, 1240.) “[A] mere contractual right of payment, without
more, will not suffice . . .” to state a cause of action for conversion. (Plummer
v. Day/Eisenberg, LLP (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 38, 45.) 
 
            The Court finds that the fourth cause of action for
conversion is insufficiently alleged. (FAC, ¶¶ 28-31.) Plaintiff alleges that former
defendant Pacific Coast intentionally withheld and converted Plaintiff’s funds
for its own use. (FAC, ¶¶ 29, 31.) There is no allegation that Defendant
converted Plaintiff’s funds. (FAC, ¶¶ 28-31.) 
 
            As such, the fourth cause of action in the FAC for
conversion against Defendant Xue fails to state sufficient facts. The demurrer
to this cause of action is sustained. 
 
 
Fifth Cause of Action—Unjust
Enrichment 
 
            Defendant contends that the demurrer to the fifth cause
of action for unjust enrichment should be sustained because such cause of
action is not a recognized cause of action. Plaintiff contends that some courts
have recognized a cause of action for unjust enrichment.
 
            The Court finds that Plaintiff’s citation to Prakashpalan
v. Engstrom, Lipscomb & Lack (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1105 is inapposite because
such case does not stand for the principle that unjust enrichment is a
standalone cause of action. (Id. at p. 1132.) 
 
            Moreover, the Court notes that “California does not
recognize a cause of action for unjust enrichment.” (Hooked Media Group,
Inc. v. Apple Inc. (2020) 55 Cal.App.5th 323, 336.)  
 
            The demurrer to the fifth cause of action for unjust
enrichment is sustained. 
 
Legal Standard for Motions to
Strike 
 
            “The court may, upon a motion made pursuant to Section
435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper: (a)
Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.
(b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity
with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.”¿(Code
Civ. Proc. § 436.) “Immaterial” or “irrelevant” matters include allegations not
essential to the claim, allegations neither pertinent to nor supported by an
otherwise sufficient claim or a demand for judgment requesting relief not
supported by the allegations of the complaint. (Code Civ. Proc. § 431.10,
subds. (b)(1)-(3).) 
 
            Defendant moves to strike allegations of punitive damages
as to the fourth cause of action for conversion in the FAC. Based on the Court
finding that the conversion cause of action is insufficiently alleged, the
motion to strike is moot. 
 
Conclusion
 
The demurrer to the first cause of action in the FAC is overruled. The
demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action in the FAC is sustained with
leave to amend. The Court sustains the demurrer to the fifth cause of action
without leave to amend. The motion to strike is moot. The amended complaint
shall be filed and served on or before August 5, 2024.
