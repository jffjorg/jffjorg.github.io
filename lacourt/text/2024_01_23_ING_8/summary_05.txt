Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case (Case Number: 23TRCV01664) filed by Adam Bouzoubaa Abderrahman and Serine Limo Inc. against General Motors LLC. The case involves a complaint filed on February 5, 2021, alleging various causes of action, including breach of warranty and refusal to repurchase a vehicle. The plaintiffs sought to compel the deposition of a person designated by General Motors LLC (PMQ) and produce documents related to the case. The defendant objected to the deposition notice and failed to produce a witness.

The judge found that the plaintiffs attempted to meet and confer in good faith, but the defendant failed to respond to the meet and confer letters. The judge granted the motion in part, denying it in part, and ordered the deposition to be taken on February 16, 2024.

The judge analyzed each category of information requested by the plaintiffs and found that certain categories, such as those related to General Motors' internal analysis of defects and its policies and procedures for evaluating and investigating consumer requests for repurchase and replacement of vehicles, were relevant and likely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The judge also found that other categories, such as those related to General Motors' third-party dispute resolution program, were irrelevant.

The judge ordered General Motors to produce a witness on certain categories and to participate in deciding a mutually agreeable date, time, and place for the deposition. The judge also noted that the defendant's failure to comply with its own policies and procedures may be admissible as bearing on a willfulness civil penalty.
