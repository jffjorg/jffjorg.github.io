And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion to quash two deposition subpoenas issued to the Manhattan Beach Police Department (MBPD) by the plaintiff. The subpoenas seek videos of the plaintiff and third parties in or around bathroom stalls, as well as security camera footage from the Manhattan Beach County Club. The defendant argues that the MBPD must comply with the federal protective order issued in the criminal case, which prevents the disclosure of certain records. The Court disagrees with this argument, noting that the federal protective order was not in effect before the subpoenas were served and that the MBPD would not be in direct violation of the order. The Court also notes that the defendant's moving arguments are inconsistent and that there is no evidence that the subject videos were designated as confidential information governed by the federal protective order.

The Court is concerned about the chronology of events and the potential implications of the mental health diversion in the criminal case. The Court would like to hear oral argument on the motion to quash and has ordered the parties to appear before the Court to discuss the issue. The Court will make a final ruling on the motion to quash after hearing oral argument.
