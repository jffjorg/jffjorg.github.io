And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to grant the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a third amended complaint. Despite the opposition's claims of prejudicial delay, procedural shortcomings, and the likelihood of demurring to the third amended complaint, the judge finds that the case has not been set for trial and the five-month delay from the July deposition to the December motion is not unreasonable. The judge also finds that leave to amend is liberally granted in California, and the plaintiff has acted diligently and expeditiously in seeking the amendments. The judge notes that the cross-defendants will not suffer extreme prejudice from the amendments and that they have not had to spend exorbitant amounts of time and money on discovery that may need to be redone based on the new allegations. The judge orders that the motion be granted, subject to the procedural shortcomings being addressed on demurrer and the opposition's merits arguments being addressed on dispositive motion.
