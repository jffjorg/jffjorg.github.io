And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to strike punitive damages allegations. The defendant, Blue Cross, moves to strike the allegations, but the court denies the motion. The court finds that the plaintiff has properly pled facts that, if proven, would support a claim for punitive damages. Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that Blue Cross failed to properly process their claim due to the addition of new personnel in 2017 and failure to ensure correct data processing, despite a previous lawsuit warning. The court finds that these allegations, if proven, would demonstrate malice as defined in Civil Code § 3294(c)(1), which means conduct carried on with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights of policyholders. The court orders Blue Cross to file its answer within 10 days.
