Governing Statutes
 
Code of Civil Procedure
§ 704.740 provides in relevant part:
 
“(a) … the interest of a natural
person in a dwelling may not be sold under this division to enforce a money
judgment except pursuant to a court order for sale obtained under this article
and the dwelling exemption shall be determined under this article.
 
Code of Civil Procedure
§ 704.750 provides in relevant part:
 
“(a) Promptly after a dwelling is
levied upon…the levying officer shall serve notice on the judgment creditor
that the levy has been made and that the property will be released unless the
judgment creditor complies with the requirements of this section. Service shall
be made personally or by mail. Within 20 days after service of the notice, the
judgment creditor shall apply to the court for an order for sale of the
dwelling and shall file a copy of the application with the levying officer. If
the judgment creditor does not file the copy of the application for an order
for sale of the dwelling within the allowed time, the levying officer shall
release the dwelling.
 
Code of Civil Procedure
§ 704.770 provides in relevant part:
 
“(a) Upon the filing of the
application by the judgment creditor, the court shall set a time and place for
hearing and order the judgment debtor to show cause why an order for sale
should not be made in accordance with the application. The time set for hearing
shall be not later than 45 days after the application is filed or such later
time as the court orders upon a showing of good cause.”
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff/Judgment
Creditor filed the application required under Section 704.750 On August 24,
2023. The judicial officer assigned to this department was unavailable at that
time and therefore unable to issue the OSC or set a hearing within 45 days as
required by Section 704.770. There is good cause, therefore, under Section
704.770, to set the OSC and hear the application beyond the 45-day limit.
 
Conclusion
 

            Because
the court was unavailable to handle this matter when it was filed, there is
good cause to hear it beyond the 45-day statutory deadline. Therefore, the
motion is GRANTED. The court sets an Order to Show Cause re: Sale of Dwelling
for December 11, 2023, at 8:30 am
