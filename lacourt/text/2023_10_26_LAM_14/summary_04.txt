And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer to the first, second, third, and tenth causes of action is SUSTAINED, with 10 days leave to amend. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has not attached the contract to the FAC, has not properly differentiated between Defendant Framework and Defendants Cohen, Alcantara, and Ezrachi, and has not clearly alleged that any other Defendant knew that Amrusi was unfit while he was working with the Plaintiff. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff's two negligence claims are duplicative and should be combined into a single claim.

The Judge rejects the Defendant's request for judicial notice of the original complaint and the FAC, finding that the court does not need to take judicial notice of these documents to evaluate the sufficiency of the FAC.

The Judge orders the Plaintiff to do two things in her next amendment: (1) make sure to attach the document in question to the FAC, and (2) explain how the alleged contract can be enforced against Defendants Cohen, Alcantara, and Ezrachi, who are not named as parties in the document.
