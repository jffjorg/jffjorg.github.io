  Case Number:  20STCV31327    Hearing Date:   October 26, 2023    Dept:  14 Instant Motion
 
            Plaintiff
now moves this court for an order continuing the trial to early 2024. 
 
Decision
 
            The motion is
DENIED. 
 
Discussion
 
California
Rules of Court Rule 3.1332(a) provides that trial dates are to be treated as
firm. However, Rule 3.1332(c) provides that, although continuances are “disfavored,”
requests should be considered on an individual basis. That subsection also
includes a non-exhaustive list of possible grounds for a continuance.
 
            Defendants make
their motion under the auspices of Rule 3.1332(c)(1), (6), and (7). Rule 3.1332(c)(1)
provides for a continuance if an essential witness, is unavailable due to “death,
illness, or other excusable circumstances.” Rule 3.1332(c)(6) provides for a
continuance if a party has an “excused inability to obtain essential testimony,
documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts.” Rule 3.1332(c)(7)
provides for a continuance if there is a “significant, unanticipated change in
the status of the case.” None of these rules apply to this situation.
 
            There is no
showing that any witness will be unavailable for trial. There is no showing
that there was a significant event in this case which was in any way unusual.
Nor can the parties’ failure to complete discovery be properly “excused,” any
more than their efforts can be described as “diligent.” 
 
            When this
motion was filed, the trial date was September 18, 2023, and the parties had a
mediation session reserved for October 19, 2023. For reasons arising from the
court’s own needs, the trial date has since been re-scheduled to November 20,
2023, and the mediation date is now passed. There is no reason for any further
continuance.
 
Conclusion
 
            There is no
good cause for a continuance here. The motion is DENIED.
