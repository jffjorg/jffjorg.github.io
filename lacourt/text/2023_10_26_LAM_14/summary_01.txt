And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to continue the trial to early 2024. The judge cites California Rules of Court Rule 3.1332(a), which states that trial dates are to be treated as firm, and Rule 3.1332(c), which allows for continuances on an individual basis, but only in specific circumstances not present in this case. The defendants had argued that they needed a continuance due to the unavailability of an essential witness, an excused inability to obtain essential evidence, or a significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case, but the judge found that none of these grounds were met. The judge also noted that the parties' failure to complete discovery was not excusable and that there was no good cause for a continuance. The motion is therefore denied.
