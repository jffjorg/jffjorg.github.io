STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and conversion.
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants misappropriated funds intended for the
purchase of a 2008 Sea Ray 44 Sundancer boat. 
 
Defendants and Cross-Complainants
move for a trial continuance. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendants and Cross-Complainants
move for a trial continuance. 
 
“To ensure the prompt disposition of civil
cases, the dates assigned for trial are firm. All parties and their counsel
must regard the date set for trial as certain.” (Cal Rules of Court Rule
3.1332(a).) Therefore, “continuances of trials are disfavored.” (Cal Rules of
Court Rule 3.1332(c).) 
 
Defendants and Cross-Complainants seek a
trial continuance of unspecified length on the basis that they have been unable
to complete a deposition of Plaintiffs in time to prepare a Motion for Summary
Judgment or Summary Adjudication. Good cause for a continuance
exists as a result of a party’s “excused inability to obtain essential
testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent efforts.”
(Rule 3.1332(c)(6).) Here, however, Defendants and Cross-Complainants offer no
evidence of their diligence beyond a conclusory statement by their counsel that
he has “been in good-faith negotiations to complete discovery in this matter.” Such
meager filings are not sufficient to demonstrate that a trial continuance is
warranted. 
 
            Accordingly,
Defendants and Cross-Complainants’ Motion for Continuance of Trial is DENIED. 
 
This ruling is without prejudice
to a procedurally proper motion supported by evidence setting forth good cause
for a continuance. 
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
