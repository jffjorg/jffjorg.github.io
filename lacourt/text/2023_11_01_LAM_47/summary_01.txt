And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Theresa M. Traber, has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion for a trial continuance filed by the defendants and cross-complainants, Ken Sampson, Dey Sampson, and The Boardroom MDR, LLC. The defendants had sought a continuance of unspecified length, citing their inability to complete a deposition of the plaintiffs in time to prepare a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. However, the judge found that the defendants' conclusory statement of their efforts to complete discovery was not sufficient to demonstrate good cause for a continuance. The judge noted that continuances of trials are disfavored and that the dates assigned for trial are firm. The judge also cited California Rules of Court Rule 3.1332(a), which states that the dates assigned for trial are firm and that all parties and their counsel must regard the date set for trial as certain. The judge's tentative ruling is without prejudice to a procedurally proper motion supported by evidence setting forth good cause for a continuance.
