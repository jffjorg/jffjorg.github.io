And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in this case, addressing the demurrer filed by the defendant, Westside Residence Hall, Inc., to the complaint filed by the plaintiff, Lawrence Kaufman. The court has sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action for breach of warranty of habitability (Health & Safety Code § 17920.3) without leave to amend, as the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court has also sustained the demurrer to the sixth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress with 20 days leave to amend, as the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to show that the defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous.

The court has overruled the demurrer to the ninth cause of action for fraud, finding that the complaint states facts sufficient to support a cause of action for fraud. The court has granted the motion to strike certain paragraphs of the complaint with 20 days leave to amend.
