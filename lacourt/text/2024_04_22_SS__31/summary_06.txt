And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel discovery responses from the Plaintiffs. The Defendant had propounded discovery requests on the Plaintiffs on November 2, 2023, and they failed to respond despite multiple extensions. The Defendant then filed a motion to compel the Plaintiffs to respond to the outstanding discovery requests. The Plaintiffs filed an untimely opposition, which the court will not consider. The court has granted the Defendant's motion to compel, ordering the Plaintiffs to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days. The court has also imposed sanctions on the Plaintiffs, ordering them to pay $1,180 in attorney's fees and $240 in filing fees. Additionally, the court has ordered the Plaintiffs to pay $940 in sanctions for the Defendant's counsel's time.
