And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's request for court default judgment. The plaintiff, Carmen Castaneda, filed the action against Joshua Oshiro and others for damages arising from a motor vehicle collision. However, the plaintiff failed to complete the declaration of nonmilitary status and did not submit a copy of the Statement of Damages, as required by court rules. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects by a certain date. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.
