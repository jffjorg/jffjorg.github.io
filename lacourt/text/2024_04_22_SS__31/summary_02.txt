And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the petition for approval of a compromise of a pending action of a minor, Alyssa Garcia, and has denied the petition. The reasons for denial include the lack of a guardian ad litem for the minor and the incorrect use of an expedited petition, which is reserved for settlements of $50,000 or less. The court notes that the application for appointment of a guardian ad litem was previously rejected. The court orders the moving party to file a new petition, curing the defects, at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.
