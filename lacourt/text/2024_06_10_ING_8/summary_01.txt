And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling discusses the motion to amend the judgment in the case of Donald Baxter v. Alvin Pittman, et al. The motion seeks to correct the judgment, award post-998 offer interest and expert witness fees, and address the Howell issue. The court finds that the 998 offers were reasonable and made in good faith, and awards the post-offer expert fees. The court also addresses the MICRA issue, finding that the jury's award of non-economic damages must be reduced to $250,000. The court further addresses the Howell issue, finding that the defense failed to provide evidence to support their claim that the past medical expenses were not incurred. The court denies the defense's request to strike the award of past medical expenses. The court also addresses the issue of comparative fault, finding that the defense failed to provide evidence to support their claim that the jury's award of comparative fault was erroneous. The court concludes that the modified judgment should be $7,012,500.
