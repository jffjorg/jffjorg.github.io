And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the third cause of action (intentional tort) is sustained with 20 days' leave to amend. The judge found that the plaintiffs failed to allege with sufficient specificity that the defendants' conduct was "outrageous" and that the defendants acted with reckless disregard for the probability of causing emotional distress to the plaintiffs. The judge also found that the plaintiffs failed to allege an actual and proximate causal link between the defendants' alleged tortious conduct and the emotional distress suffered by the plaintiffs. The judge ordered that the defendants give notice of the ruling.
