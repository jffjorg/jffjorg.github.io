          Defendants FG
Property Management, Inc. (“FG”) and 412 Coronado Terrace, LLC (“412 Coronado”)
(collectively, “Defendants”) demur to Plaintiffs Brittany Perez’s (“Brittany”),
Owen Perez’s (“Owen”), and Joy Perez by and through her GAL Evelyn W. Tamayac’s
(“Joy”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) complaint (“Complaint”) on the grounds the
3rd cause of action for intentional tort does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.  (Notice of
Demurrer, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §430.10(e).)[1]
 
Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer, the
moving party must meet and confer in person, by
telephone, or by video conference with the party who
filed the pleading to attempt to reach an agreement that would resolve the
objections to the pleading and obviate the need for filing the demurrer.  (C.C.P. §430.41, emphasis added.) 
Defendants’ counsel declares that
on June 11, 2024, he spoke with Plaintiffs’ attorney telephonically and
discussed the deficiencies stated in Defendants’ demurrer.  (See Decl. of Koumoulis
¶3.)  Defendants’ counsel
declares that he and Plaintiff’s counsel were not able to reach resolution
resolving the demurrer.  (Decl. of Koumoulis
¶3.)  Defendants’ counsel’s declaration
is sufficient under C.C.P. §430.41. 
Accordingly, the Court will consider Defendants’ demurrer.
 
          Background
          Plaintiffs sue
for an alleged exposure to mold in the premises they rented from
Defendants.  Plaintiffs filed the operative Complaint on February 15,
2024, against Defendants alleging six causes of action: (1) premises liability;
(2) general negligence; (3) intentional tort; (4) private nuisance; (5)
tortious breach of warranty of habitability; and (6) negligent infliction of
emotional distress.  Plaintiffs’ causes
of action arise from mold growing within the walls of their residence at 412
North Coronado Terrace, Apt. 7, Los Angeles CA. 
(See Complaint ¶Prem.L-1.)
          Defendants
filed the instant demurrer on June 17, 2024. 
Plaintiffs filed their opposition on June 25, 2024.  Defendants filed their reply on July 24,
2024.
 
Summary of
Demurrer
Defendants demur
to the 3rd cause of action for “intentional tort” on the basis the claim does
not allege “with great specificity” conduct “so extreme as to exceed all bounds
of that usually tolerated in a civilized community.”   (Demurrer,
pg. 3.)
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Insurance Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider
declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted
for the truth of their contents].)  For
purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed
to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of
law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital
District (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State
a Claim
Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress (3rd COA)
To allege a cause
of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress a plaintiff must
allege the following: (1) outrageous conduct by the defendant; (2) an intention
by defendant to cause, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing,
emotional distress; (3) severe emotional distress; and (4) an actual and
proximate causal link between the tortious conduct and the emotional distress.  (Nally v. Grace Community Church (1988)
47 Cal.3d 278, 253.)
“Behavior may be
considered outrageous if a defendant (1) abuses a relation or position which
gives him power to damage the plaintiff’s interest; (2) knows the plaintiff is susceptible
to injuries through mental distress; or (3) acts intentionally or unreasonably
with the recognition that the acts are likely to result in illness through
mental distress.”  (McDaniel v. Gile
(1991) 230 Cal. App.3d 363, 372.)  “Severe
emotional distress means emotional distress of such substantial quality or
enduring quality that no reasonable [person] in civilized society should be
expected to endure it.”  (Potter v.
Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 965, 1004.)
Plaintiffs allege
Defendants’ conduct was outrageous, that Defendants acted with reckless
disregard of the probability that Plaintiffs would suffer emotional distress,
knowing that Plaintiffs were present on said premises when Defendants’ conduct
occurred, that Plaintiffs suffered severe emotional distress, and that
Defendants’ conduct was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiffs’ severe
emotional distress.  (Complaint ¶IT-1.)
Plaintiffs fail
to allege with any specificity that Defendants’ conduct that was “outrageous”
as a matter of law.  Plaintiffs fail to
allege facts of an actual and proximate causal link between Defendants’ alleged
tortious conduct and the emotional distress they suffered.
Accordingly,
Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiffs’ 3rd cause of action is sustained with 20
days leave to amend.
 
          Conclusion
Defendants’
demurrer to Plaintiffs’ 3rd cause of action is sustained with 20 days
leave to amend.
