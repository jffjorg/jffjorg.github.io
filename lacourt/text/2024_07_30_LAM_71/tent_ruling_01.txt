Petitioners

and denied in part.

confirm the contractual arbitration award against Respondent Liberty Mutual
Insurance (“Liberty Mutual”) (“Respondent”). 
(Petition, pg. 2.) 
Petitioners further moves for an order awarding them interest from
October 14, 2021, at the statutory rate, costs of suit in the amount of
$53,281.66, and attorneys’ fees incurred in this action in the amount of
$42,000.00.  (Petition, pg. 3.)
 
Evidentiary
Objections
Respondent’s
7/1/24 evidentiary objections to the Declaration of Joseph M. Kar (“Kar”) are
sustained as to Nos. 1 and 2. 
 
Background
On January 22, 2021, Rodriguez, the driver, and
Rios, the passenger were involved in a motor vehicle accident with an
underinsured motorist (“UIM”) in West Los Angeles, on Sawtelle Avenue.  (12/15/22 Statement of Decision and
Arbitration Ruling, pg. 2.)  
The matter proceeded to a bifurcated
arbitration, and the first phase of arbitration took place on November 28,
2022, before Arbitrator Darrell A. Forgey, Esq., to determine the issue of
liability.  (12/15/22 Statement of
Decision and Arbitration Ruling, pg. 1.) 
The Arbitrator determined Rodriguez and the driver of the other vehicle,
Brown, were both in violation of the Vehicle Code at the time of impact, and
therefore this case was one of comparative negligence.  (12/15/22 Statement of Decision and
Arbitration Ruling, pg. 2.)  The
Arbitrator determined the motorist, Brown, was 60% responsible, Rodriguez was
40% responsible, and Rios bore no responsibility as a passenger.  (12/15/22 Statement of Decision and
Arbitration Ruling, pg. 2.)  
The
second phase of arbitration took place on February 14 and 15, 2024, to
determine the issue of damages before the same arbitrator.  (3/8/24 Statement of Decision and
Arbitration Ruling, pg. 1.)  Petitioners
alleged significant injuries with “quite excessive medical expenses.”  (3/8/24
Statement of Decision and Arbitration Ruling, pg. 2.)  Respondent had $250,000.00 in UIM benefits
for both parties, less $15,000.00 paid to each by the motorist, Brown.  (3/8/24
Statement of Decision and Arbitration Ruling, pg. 2.)  Therefore, $235,000.00 was available to each
Petitioner in the proceeding.  (3/8/24 Statement of Decision and
Arbitration Ruling, pg. 2.)  Petitioners
each sought the remaining limits of $235,000.00 for their alleged
injuries.  (3/8/24 Statement of Decision and Arbitration Ruling, pg. 3.)  
The Arbitrator determined the was a failure of
proof by Petitioners.  (3/8/24 Statement of Decision and
Arbitration Ruling, pg. 3.)  The
Arbitrator concluded Rodriguez’s claim was worth a total of $100,000.00 for
past and future medical expense, any claimed loss of earning and any past and
future pain and suffering.  (3/8/24 Statement of Decision and
Arbitration Ruling, pg. 3.)  The
Arbitrator then deducted $40,000.00 for comparative negligence and the
$15,000.00 already paid by the UIM, leaving Rodriguez with a “new money” award
of $45,000.00.  The Arbitrator determined
that for Rios, an award of $75,000.00 was appropriate, less the $15,000.00
received from the UIM, resulting in a “new money” award of $60,000.00.  (3/8/24
Statement of Decision and Arbitration Ruling, pg. 3.)  
On June
10, 2024, Petitioners filed the instant petition requesting this Court confirm
the Arbitration Award for recovery of $105,000 (principal sum), plus $53,281.66
in costs and $42,000 in attorneys’ fees pursuant to tort of another doctrine.  (Petition Memo, pg. 2; Petition ¶¶10(e)-(f).)  The Petition also requests interest at the
statutory rate from October 14, 2024. 
(Petition ¶10(d).)  On June 24,
2024, Respondent filed its opposition to Petitioners’ Petition.  On May 23, 2024, Petitioner filed his opposition
to Respondent’s Cross-Petition to Vacate the Arbitration Award.  On June 27, 2024, Petitioners filed a
response to Respondents’ opposition.
 
Legal Standard
The party seeking
judicial enforcement of a private arbitration award has the burden of proving
the award as well as the existence of a valid arbitration agreement.  (Toal v. Tardif (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th
1208, 1223 [holding burden not met by submitting copy of contract with
arbitration provision signed by party’s attorney rather than by party
personally].)
The specific grounds
upon which an arbitrator’s award may be vacated are set forth in C.C.P.
§1286.2.  Except for such grounds,
arbitration awards are immune from judicial review.  (See Moncharsh v. Heily & Blase (1992)
3 Cal.4th 1, 10-11 [limiting grounds for judicial review effectuates the
parties’ agreement that the award be final and also reflects that arbitrators
need not follow the law and may base their decisions on “broad principles of
justice and equity . . . paths neither marked nor traceable by judicial review”].)  Courts cannot pass upon the validity of the
arbitrator’s reasoning and cannot substitute its judgment for that of the
arbitrator.  (See id. at pg. 11.)
The sufficiency of
the evidence is immaterial in reviewing an arbitration award.  (Morris v. Zuckerman (1968) 69 Cal.2d
686, 691 [“Neither the
merits of the
controversy. . . nor the sufficiency of the evidence to support the arbitrator’s
award are matters for judicial review.”].)
 
Discussion
Petitioner has met
its burden to prove the arbitration award and the existence of the valid
arbitration agreement.  (Petition
¶4, Attach. 4(b); Petition ¶8, Attach 8(c).)[1]
          Respondent’s objections to the
confirmation of the Award are well taken. 
Petitioners request prejudgment interest, fees, and costs to which they
are not entitled.  Petitioners do not
cite any authority under which they are entitled to recover prejudgment
interest on a UIM claim, and Insurance Code §11580.2, does not authorize an
award of prejudgment interest in UIM proceedings.  (See Glassman v. Safeco Insurance Co. of America
(2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 1281, 1313, as modified (May 17, 2023) [“In sum,
the Uninsured Motorist Act, and specifically Insurance Code section 11580.2,
does not address the availability of prejudgment interest in UIM proceedings,
whether expressly allowing or disallowing it.”].)  Petitioners are not entitled to prejudgment
interest on a contract claim under Civil Code §3287, as prejudgment interest is
a discretionary award and the Arbitration Award had already been paid by
Respondent upon the filing of Petitioners’ petition on June 10, 2024.  (Decl. of Armstrong ¶10, Exh. F.)  Further, Petitioners are not entitled to
“liquidated damages” under §3287(a) because Petitioners’ damages against Brown
were not certain or capable of being made certain.  (Sagadin v. Ripper (1985) 175
Cal.App.3d 1141.)  Finally, Petitioners
are not entitled to prejudgment interest under Civil Code §3291 because the
statute does not authorize an award of prejudgment interest in UIM proceedings
because they are actions on contract and not personal injury actions.  (Pilimai v. Farmers Insurance Exchange Co.
(2006) 39 Cal.4th 133, 146.)
          Respondent’s object to Petitioners’
request for costs is also well taken.  Unless
an arbitration agreement provides otherwise, the parties to the arbitration are
required to bear their own costs.  (See,
e.g., Storm v. Standard Fire Insurance Co. (2020) 52 Cal.App.5th
636, 643-644; Austin v. Allstate Insurance Co. (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th
1812, 1815 [recognizing “the legislative policy of this state that arbitration
costs are to be borne by the party incurring them, unless the arbitration
agreement provides otherwise”].)
          The insurance policy at issue states,
in pertinent part:
ARBITRATION
A.  
If we
and an “insured” do not agree:
1.    
Whether
that person is legally entitled to recover damages under this coverage; or
2.    
As to
the amount of damages; then the matter will be settled by arbitration. . . .
. . .
B.   
Each
party will:
1.    
Pay the
expenses it incurs; and
2.    
Bear
the expenses of the arbitrator equally.
 
(Uninsured
Motorists Coverage - California, pg. 4 of 5.)
          Here, Petitioners do not have a right
to cover costs because the UIM policy does not require Respondent to bear
Petitioners’ costs.  Further, Petitioners
are not entitled to an award of costs based on C.C.P. §998 because Petitioners
each filed C.C.P. §998 offers in the amount of $235,000, but the arbitration
award only granted Rodriguez $45,000 and Rios $60,000.  (Decl. of Armstrong ¶7, Exhs. C-D.)
          Respondent’s objection to Petitioners’
request for attorneys’ fees is well taken. Unless attorneys’ fees are
specifically authorized by a statute or a contractual agreement between the
parties, each side must bear their own fees. (C.C.P. §1021; Douglas E.
Barnhart, Inc. v. CMC Fabricators, Inc. (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 230; Mountain
Air Enterprises, LLC v. Sundowner Towers, LLC (2017) 3 Cal.5th 744.)  Petitioners are not entitled to attorneys’
fees under the tort of another doctrine because invoking the doctrine runs
afoul of Insurance Code §11580.26(b), which provides, “No cause of action shall
exist against either an insured or insurer from exercising the right to request
arbitration of a claim under section 11580.2.” 
(Ins. Code §11580.26(b).) 
Further, a UIM proceeding is not a tort action, and therefore no tort
damages in the form of attorneys’ fees may be awarded against Respondent.  (Pilimai, 39 Cal.4th at pg. 146.)  Finally, the tort of another doctrine
requires proof that the Petitioners were “required to act in the protection of
their interests” by “bringing or defending an action against a third person.”  Here, there is no third party, only
Petitioners and Respondent.
          Accordingly, Petitioner’s petition is
granted only as to the damages awarded to Rodriguez in the amount of $45,000
and Rios in the amount of $60,000.  Petitioners’ petition is otherwise
denied.  Further the Court orders the 
Clerk
to enter, concurrently with the Judgment, Satisfaction of Judgment in light of Respondent’s
evidence of  payment of the award.  (Decl.
of Armstrong ¶10, Exh. F.)  
 
Conclusion
Petitioners’ petition to confirm the
arbitration award is granted in part and denied in part.  Petitioner’s petition is
granted only as to the damages awarded to Rodriguez in the amount of $45,000
and Rios in the amount of $60,000.  Petitioners’ petition is otherwise denied. 
Clerk
to enter, concurrently with the Judgment, Satisfaction of Judgment.
Moving Party to give notice.
