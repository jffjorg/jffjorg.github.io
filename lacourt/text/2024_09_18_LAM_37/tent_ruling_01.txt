Carson; (collectively “Defendants”); and Does 1 to 100. The operative Complaint
alleges the following six causes of action:
 
1)    
Disability
Discrimination in Violation of Gov. Code § 12940(a): Disparate Treatment Based
on Disability and/or Perceived Disability; 
2)    
Disability
Discrimination in Violation of Gov. Code § 12940(m): Failure to Provide
Reasonable Accommodation; 
3)    
Disability
Discrimination in Violation of Gov. Code § 12940(n): Failure to Engage in the
Interactive Process; 
4)    
Retaliation
in Violation of Gov. Code § 12940(h);

Failure
to Do Everything Reasonably Necessary to Prevent Discrimination and Retaliation
from Occurring in Violation of Gov. Code § 12940(k); and 
6)

Termination in Violation of Public Policy. 
 
On June 21, 2024, Defendant JobSource
Carson (erroneously sued as “Jobsource Carson, Inc.”) (hereinafter
“Defendant”) filed a motion to strike punitive damages from the Complaint.
Plaintiff opposes the Motion. The matter is now before the court. 
 
motion to
strike complaint[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Any party, within the time allowed
to respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the
whole or any part thereof. (CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court
may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it deems
proper: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in
any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (CCP, § 436(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767,
782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage;
probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
“Where the defect
raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer is reasonably capable of cure,
leave to amend is routinely and liberally granted to give the plaintiff a
chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of
San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.) The burden is on the
complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Goodman
v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 

 
II.        Discussion
 
Defendant
moves to strike punitive damages from the Complaint, as alleged in Paragraphs
40, 54, 68, 90, 99, 108, and Paragraph D in the Prayer for Relief, on the basis
that the Complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to support a claim for
punitive damages. 
 
The
Complaint alleges that Plaintiff was hired by Defendants and held the position
of stocker when he was hired on or about January 2021. (Compl., ¶ 22.) On July
6, 2021, Plaintiff suffered an occupational injury to his left hand and
reported the injury to Defendants. (Id., ¶ 24.) As a result of his
injury, Plaintiff sought various accommodations due to his disability such as
modified work duty, time off to see a doctor, and assistance with lifting heavy
items. (Id., ¶ 25) On July 8, 2021, Defendants terminated Plaintiff due
to his disability and/or perceived disability and requested accommodations. (Id.,
¶ 26.)
 
To
state a claim for punitive damages under Civ. Code § 3294, a plaintiff must
allege specific facts showing that the defendant has been guilty of malice,
oppression, or fraud. (Smith v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal. App. 4th
1033, 1042.)¿ The basis for punitive damages must be pled with specificity;
conclusory allegations devoid of any factual assertions are insufficient. (Ibid.)¿¿“Malice”
is defined in Civ. Code § 3294 (c)(1) as “conduct which is intended by the
defendant to cause injury” or “despicable conduct which is carried on by the
defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of
others.” “Oppression” is “despicable conduct subjecting a person to cruel and
unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.” (Civ. Code §
3294(c)(2).) The term “despicable” has been defined in the case law as actions
that are “base,” “vile,” or “contemptible.”¿ (Shade Foods, Inc. v.
Innovative Products Sales & Marketing, Inc. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 847,
891.)¿¿ 
 
The
Complaint also fails to identify an officer, director, or managing agent of
Defendant who knew about Plaintiff’s disability and requests for accommodation
and who made or ratified the decision to terminate Plaintiff based on
Plaintiff’s disability. When the defendant is a¿corporation, “the oppression,
fraud, or malice must be perpetrated, authorized, or knowingly ratified by an
officer, director, or managing agent of the¿corporation.” (Wilson v.
Southern California Edison Company (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 123, 164; see
Civ. Code, § 3294(b).)  Without such facts, the court cannot find that
Defendant is vicariously liable for the malice, fraud, or oppression
perpetrated by one of its employees. 
 
Therefore,
the motion to strike is granted with leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant’s
motion to strike is granted with leave to amend.
