And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has declined to grant a motion filed by Counsel Anthony Willoughby, seeking to be relieved as counsel in the case. Counsel claims that there has been a significant breakdown in communication with the plaintiff, Christopher Jesus Hernandez, and that he has been unable to confirm the plaintiff's address or locate a more current address. The judge has denied the motion without prejudice, meaning that it can be refiled at a later time. The judge has also ordered Counsel to give notice of the denial. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court. If the parties do not submit or appear at the hearing, the court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the court.
