And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of Counsel (Anthony Willoughby) to be relieved as counsel, without prejudice. Counsel had contended that relief was necessary because they had lost all contact with the Plaintiffs (Angel Munguia and Ernesto Castellano) and were unable to confirm their address or locate a more current address. The judge has ordered Counsel to continue serving the moving papers on the Plaintiffs and on the Clerk of the Court, as required by law. The judge has also encouraged the parties to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the hearing date and time, counsel's contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.
