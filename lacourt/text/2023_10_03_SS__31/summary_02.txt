The judge has denied the request for default judgment submitted by Suzette Gonzalez against Gustavo Gomez Garcia and New Ride Taxi due to several defects in the submission. The plaintiff's declaration requests $2 million in general damages, but the CIV-100 document requests only $1 million, leading to confusion over the amount sought. Additionally, the plaintiff's signed declaration is not dated, and the evidence submitted does not support a judgment for such a high amount. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has not properly dismissed all other parties, including the Doe defendants. Furthermore, the court is unable to locate a copy of the Statement of Damages. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to correct these defects and resubmit a new default judgment package by a certain date. Failure to do so may result in sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.

* **Insufficient Evidence:** The judge believes the evidence provided doesn't support such a high damage claim.

  - "Plaintiff must dismiss all other parties not sought..."
  - "The Court is unable to locate a copy of the Statement of Damages..."
  - "Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions..."

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the request for default judgment for several reasons. The total amount sought is over $10 million, while the general damages in CIV-100 only read $1 million. The plaintiff must correct any typographical errors and be consistent in the amount sought, which is either $1 million or $2 million. Additionally, the plaintiff's signed declaration is not dated, and the plaintiff must substantiate their claims with admissible evidence. If the plaintiff cannot substantiate their claims, they must consider lowering the amount sought. The plaintiff must also dismiss all other parties not sought, including all Doe defendants. The plaintiff filed a request for dismissal of the Doe defendants on March 2, 2023, but it was not entered. Therefore, the Doe defendants have not yet been properly dismissed. Lastly, the Court is unable to locate a copy of the Statement of Damages. The plaintiff must file a copy of the Statement of Damages served on each defendant. If the plaintiff fails to do so, sanctions may be imposed, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC for re-entry of default judgment is continued to a later date.
