And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the request for default judgment submitted by Suzette Gonzalez against Gustavo Gomez Garcia and New Ride Taxi due to several defects in the submission. The plaintiff's declaration requests $2 million in general damages, but the CIV-100 document requests only $1 million, leading to confusion over the amount sought. Additionally, the plaintiff's signed declaration is not dated, and the evidence submitted does not support a judgment for such a high amount. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has not properly dismissed all other parties, including the Doe defendants. Furthermore, the court is unable to locate a copy of the Statement of Damages. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to correct these defects and resubmit a new default judgment package by a certain date. Failure to do so may result in sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal.
