 Case Number:  19STCV17917    Hearing Date:   October 3, 2023    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  10/03/2023 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  19STCV17917 SUZETTE GONZALEZ vs GUSTAVO GOMEZ GARCIA, et al. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  Gustavo Gomez Garcia; and New Ride Taxi RECOMMENDATION:   DENY for reasons stated below.  TENTATIVE  The request for default judgment submitted on September 1, 2023 is DENIED for the following reasons:  CIV-100, Item 2, provides that the total amount sought is over $10 million, when the general damages in Item 2 reads $1 million. Plaintiff must correct any and all typographical errors.    While CIV-100 appears to be requesting $1 million in general damages, Plaintiff’s declaration requests $2 million in general damages. Plaintiff must be consistent in the amount sought. Furthermore, Plaintiff’s signed declaration is not dated.   Whether Plaintiff seeks to recover $1 million or $2 million in general damages, the Court finds the evidence submitted does not support a judgment for such a high amount for the alleged damages sustained and the lack of supporting evidence. If Plaintiff is unable to substantiate Plaintiff’s claims with admissible evidence, Plaintiff must consider lowering the amount sought to a figure reasonably supported.   Furthermore, Plaintiff must dismiss all other parties whom Plaintiff does not seek judgment against, including all Doe defendants. On March 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal of the Doe defendants, but the requested dismissal was not entered. Accordingly, the Doe defendants have not yet been properly dismissed.   Lastly, the Court is unable to locate a copy of the Statement of Damages. Plaintiff must file a copy of the Statement of Damages served on each Defendant. (CRC 3.250(a)(20).)   No later than _____________, Plaintiff is to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects.  Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued to _______________.
