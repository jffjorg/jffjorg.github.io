As for the English-text summary, here is a brief overview of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion to compel discovery responses brought by defendants Rudy Saravia and Adan Soto against plaintiff Uri Perez. The defendants had propounded discovery requests on August 30, 2022, but the plaintiff failed to respond. Despite failing to receive responses, the defendants sent correspondences to the plaintiff's counsel requesting verified responses. Since the plaintiff has not served responses, the defendants seek an order compelling the plaintiff to respond to the outstanding discovery requests without objections and pay sanctions. The judge finds that the defendants properly served the discovery requests and that the plaintiff failed to provide timely responses, therefore granting the motion to compel. The judge also awards sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $880, consisting of attorney fees and filing fees.
