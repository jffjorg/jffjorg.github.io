I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On March 28, 2023, and August 10, 2023, Defendant, Brodie
Dawson Galland, filed this motion to compel Plaintiff,
Marie Vega, to provide responses to Demand for Supplemental Inspection and
Production of Documents, Set One, and a motion for an
order establishing the truth of each matter specified in Requests for
Admission, Set One, against Defendant. 
Plaintiff seeks sanctions against Defendant and his counsel. 
 
The motions are unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO
DISCOVERY
 
If a party to
whom inspection demands were directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order to compel responses without
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b).)  If a party to
whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order that the truth of the matters specified
in the requests be deemed admitted.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)¿
Moreover, failure to timely serve responses waives objections to the
requests.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.300, subd. (a), 2033.280, subd. (a).)   
 
Monetary Sanctions 
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court to impose
discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which includes
(without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without substantial
justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive
response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial justification
making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010.)  
 
If sanctions are
sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that the notice
specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought and the
type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points and
authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the amount
of any monetary sanction. 
 
If the court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made
or opposed a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or inspection
demands, the court “shall impose a monetary sanction . . . unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).)
 In the context of a motion to deem requests for admission
admitted, it is mandatory that the court impose monetary sanctions on the party
or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to the request
necessitated the motion.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
Sanctions against
counsel:¿ The court in Kwan Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings
(2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81 (Hennings) noted that discovery sanctions
against an attorney are governed by a different standard than sanctions against
a party:¿¿¿ 
 
By
the terms of the statute, a trial court under section 2023.030(a) may not
impose monetary sanctions against a party's attorney unless the court finds
that the attorney “advised” the party to engage in the conduct resulting in
sanctions. (§ 2023.030(a); Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle (1993) 20
Cal.App.4th 256, 261, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ “Unlike monetary sanctions against
a party, which are based on the party's misuse of the discovery process,
monetary sanctions against the party's attorney require a finding the ‘attorney
advis[ed] that conduct.’ ” (Ibid.) “It is not enough that the attorney's
actions were in some way improper.” (Corns v. Miller (1986) 181
Cal.App.3d 195, 200, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247 (Corns).) Because an attorney's
advice to a client is “peculiarly within [his or her] knowledge,” the attorney
has the burden of showing that he or she did not counsel discovery abuse. (Ibid.)
Accordingly, when a party seeking sanctions against an attorney offers
sufficient evidence of a misuse of the discovery process, the burden shifts to
the attorney to demonstrate that he or she did not recommend that conduct. (Id.
at pp. 200–201, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247; Ghanooni, at p. 262, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d
501.)
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
Defendant served
Plaintiff with the at-issue discovery requests on November 22, 2022 and
February 7, 2023.  However, to date, Plaintiff
has not provided responses.  (See Grant Decls.) 
Therefore, all objections to the inspection demands and requests for admission
are waived.  
 
As Defendant
properly served the discovery requests and Plaintiff failed to serve responses,
the Court finds Defendant is entitled to an order directing Plaintiff to
provide responses to Demand for
Supplemental Inspection and Production of Documents, Set One.¿ In addition, Defendant is entitled to an order deeming
admitted Request for Admissions, Set One, against Plaintiff. 
 
Monetary
Sanctions
            Defendant requests sanctions against Plaintiff and her
counsel.  Given that the Court has
granted these motions, sanctions are warranted. 
Indeed, in the context of admissions requests, sanctions are
mandatory.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  Pursuant to Hennings, supra,
imposition of monetary sanctions against counsel is also proper unless counsel
shows that he or she did not counsel the discovery abuse.¿ (Hennings, 58
Cal.App.5th at p. 81.)¿ Plaintiff’s counsel does not meet their burden.  Accordingly, sanctions are imposed
against Plaintiff and her counsel in the amount of $355.17 representing 1 hour
at Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate, 1 hour at counsel’s paralegal’s rate, and
$120 in filing fees.
IV.       CONCLUSION 
 
The motions are granted.  
 
Plaintiff Marie Vegas is ordered to provide verified,
objection-free responses Demand for Supplemental Inspection and Production of
Documents, Set One.  Defendant’s Request for Admissions, Set One, is deemed admitted against Plaintiff.
            
The request for sanctions is granted.  Plaintiff and her counsel are ordered to pay,
jointly and severally, sanctions in the amount of $355.17, to be paid to Defendant,
by and through their counsel.
 
Discovery responses are to be provided and sanctions are to
be paid within 30 days of this order.  
 
Moving party to give notice.
