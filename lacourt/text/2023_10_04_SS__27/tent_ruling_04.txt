[1] There is no dispute about the
procedural requirements (IDC, timeliness, or meet and confer) for bringing
these motions to compel further responses.


[2] Plaintiffs originally sought
further responses to FROG Nos. 20.3 and 20.4. 
In Reply, Plaintiffs do not offer any argument regarding Nos. 20.3 and
20.4.  As such, the Court finds the
motion is moot as to this discovery.


[3] As the Hernandez Court stated, “In short, a responding party may object to an
interrogatory that seeks privileged information
by clearly stating the objection and the particular privilege invoked.  But the existence
of a document containing privileged information is not privileged.  Interrogatories may be used to discover the
existence of documents in the other party's possession. If an interrogatory
asks the responding party to identify a document, an adequate response must
include a description of the document. Thus, we agree with petitioners that a
“privilege log” is unnecessary with regard to answering interrogatories seeking
the identification of documents. (Hernandez, supra, 112 Cal.App.4th 285, 293 [cleaned up].)  The appellate
court went on to say, “petitioners have no
right to refuse to identify documents in response to interrogatories, even if
they may properly refuse to produce them later, based upon a claim of
privilege.” (Id. at p. 294.)
