And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash the deposition subpoena filed by the defendants. The defendants seek to quash the subpoena, which was issued by the plaintiffs to obtain business records from the defendant's previous employer, United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS). The defendants argue that the subpoena is overly broad and seeks irrelevant information.

After reviewing the evidence, the judge finds that the issue is moot since the plaintiffs have withdrawn the UPS subpoena. Therefore, the motion to quash the deposition subpoena is granted.

The judge notes that the parties who intend to submit on this tentative ruling must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit. If the court does not receive emails from all parties, the court may adopt the tentative ruling as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
