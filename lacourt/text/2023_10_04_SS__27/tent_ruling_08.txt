partnership with Andiamo and/or Amazon.  Plaintiffs additionally allege
that Andiamo, Amazon, EFT, and GFT owned/insured the vehicle Jaramilla operated
at the time of the subject accident. Plaintiffs filed the operated First

wrongful death and loss of consortium.

and all documents pertaining to Jaramilla’s employment.  There are no limitations on time or scope.
