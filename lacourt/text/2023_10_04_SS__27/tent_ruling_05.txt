            Claimant,
Nolan Sanchez, a minor, by and through their parent and guardian ad litem,
Petitioner, Michelle Rodelo, has agreed to settle her claims against Defendant,
Myron Estacio, in exchange for $1,059.39.  If approved, $59.39 will be used for medical
expenses, $264.85 will be used for attorney’s fees, and $95.60 will be used for
other expenses, leaving a settlement balance of $639.55 for Claimant, to be paid
or delivered to a parent of the minor, without bond, on the terms and under the
conditions specified in Probate Code sections 3401-3402.  
 
            Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc. § 372.)  The petition must be verified and “must
contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing on the
reasonableness of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition.”¿ (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)¿¿
 
            Upon
review, the Court finds the settlement balance to be fair and reasonable and
the medical expenses supported by documentation.  The Court also finds the request for
attorney’s fees to be fair and reasonable. 
However, Petitioner has not included a proposed Order Approving
Compromise on Form MC-351.    
                                                                                                          
            Based
on the foregoing, the hearing for the Petition is CONTINUED to October 18, 2023
at 1:30 PM in Department 27 of Spring Street Courthouse.  Petitioner is to file Form MC-351 no later
than 5 court days before the hearing.  The
Court will not require Petitioner’s and Claimant’s attendance at the hearing.¿
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.952, subd. (a).)¿ ¿¿  
 
Moving party to give notice.
