And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motion to compel further responses from the plaintiffs and has made a tentative ruling. There is no dispute about the procedural requirements for bringing this motion. The plaintiffs originally sought further responses to FROG Nos. 20.3 and 20.4, but in their reply, they did not offer any arguments regarding these requests. As a result, the court finds that the motion is moot as to this discovery. The court also cites a California appellate court decision (Hernandez) which holds that a responding party may not refuse to identify documents in response to interrogatories, even if they may later claim privilege.
