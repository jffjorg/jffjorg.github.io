As a result, the court finds that the motion is moot as to this discovery. The court also cites a California appellate court decision (Hernandez) which holds that a responding party may not refuse to identify documents in response to interrogatories, even if they may later claim privilege.

## English Summary

The judge's tentative ruling addresses two motions to compel further responses to discovery requests (FROG Nos. 20.3 and 20.4). 

The judge finds that the motion is moot as to FROG Nos. 20.3 and 20.4 because the plaintiffs have not argued their case regarding these specific requests.  

The judge emphasizes that while a responding party can object to interrogatories seeking privileged information, the mere existence of a document containing privileged information is not itself privileged. Responding parties must identify documents when requested, even if they might later claim privilege to withhold production. This ruling cites the Hernandez case, which reinforces the legal principle that identifying documents is permissible even if privilege might apply later.
