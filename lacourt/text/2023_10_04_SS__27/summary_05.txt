**English Summary:**

Judge Kerry Bensinger is considering a petition from Lazardo Rodelo to approve a settlement agreement for his child, Nolan Sanchez, a minor. Nolan had a claim against Myron Estacio which was settled for $1,059.39. The settlement will cover medical expenses, attorney's fees, and other costs, leaving a balance of $639.55 for Nolan.

The Judge finds the settlement to be fair and reasonable, and the medical expenses and attorney's fees are justified. However, the petition is missing a necessary form (MC-351) and the hearing is continued to October 18, 2023, to allow time for the Petitioner to file the missing form.
