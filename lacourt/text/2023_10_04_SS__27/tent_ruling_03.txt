MOTION
TO COMPEL DEFENDANT CARAMEDIX, INC.’S PERSON MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE DEPOSITION
& PRODUCTION OF RECORDS
 
MOTIONS
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiffs
Adrian Hernandez, Raoul Guzman, and Araseli Zuniga
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant Caramedix,
Inc.
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On August 24, 2020, Plaintiffs, Adrian Hernandez, Raoul
Guzman, and Araseli Zuniga, initiated this wrongful death action against
Defendant, Caramedix, Inc. (“Caramedix”), arising from a motor vehicle incident.  Defendant is a health care rideshare
service.  Plaintiffs, the children of
Decedent, Christina Garcia, allege Caramedix’s driver, Robert Villa, failed to
properly restrain Decedent’s wheelchair in their rideshare van.  While transporting Decedent to a DaVita
dialysis center, the driver abruptly stopped the van, causing Decedent to fall.  Decedent suffered injuries which ultimately resulted
in her death. 
 
            On August 22,
2023, Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel Caramedix to provide their person
most knowledgeable (PMK) for deposition and to produce documents.  Plaintiff seeks sanctions against
Caramedix.  
 
            On August
25, 2023, Plaintiffs filed motions to compel Caramedix’s further responses to
Plaintiffs’ Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One,
and Requests for Production of Documents, Set One.  Plaintiff also seeks sanctions against
Caramedix in connection with these motions.
 
            These
motions were heard on September 21, 2023. 
The Court issued a tentative ruling granting Plaintiffs’ motions.  With respect to the motions to compel further
responses to the Form and Special Interrogatories, the Court indicated
Caramedix was required to provide a privilege log if interposing objections
based on privilege.   At the hearing, counsel for Caramedix provided
the Court with case law standing for the proposition that the Civil Discovery
Act does not require a responding party to create a privilege log when objecting
to interrogatories based on privilege.  The
Court continued these motions and ordered the parties to submit supplemental
briefing on this narrow issue.  The Court
orally adopted the tentative ruling in all other respects.
 
            The parties
have filed supplemental briefs.  There is
no dispute the privilege log issue concerns Form Interrogatory Nos. 12.1, 12.2,
and 16.1-16.5, and Special Interrogatory Nos. 1-4 only.
 
            The Court now
sets forth the previously adopted ruling (Section A.
September 21, 2023 Tentative Ruling) and rules on Form Interrogatory Nos.
12.1, 12.2, and 16.1-16.5, and Special Interrogatory Nos. 1-4 (Section B. October
4, 2023 Supplemental Briefing.)
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARDS 
 
Compel PMK Deposition
 
Any party may obtain discovery by
taking in California the oral deposition of any person.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2025.010.)  “If, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action…without having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to
appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for inspection any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd.
(a).)   
 
            Compel
Further Responses to Discovery
 
            Under
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300 and 2031.310, parties may move for a
further response to interrogatories and requests for production of documents
where an answer to the requests are evasive or incomplete or where an objection
is without merit or too general.¿ A motion to compel further response to
requests for production “shall set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(1).)¿¿ 
¿ 
Notice of the motions must be
given within 45 days of service of the verified response, otherwise, the
propounding party waives any right to compel a further response.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (c); 2031.310, subd. (c).)¿ The motions must also be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300,
subd. (c); 2031.310, subd. (c).)¿¿ 
¿ 
Finally, Cal. Rules of Court, Rule
3.1345 requires that all motions or responses involving further discovery
contain a separate statement with the text of each request, the response, and a
statement of factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses.¿ (Cal.
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345, subd. (a)(3).)¿ 
¿ 
            Monetary
Sanctions¿ 
¿ 
            Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court
to impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which
includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial
justification making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿ 
¿ 
            If
sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that
the notice specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought
and the type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points
and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the
amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿¿¿ 
 
            “If
a motion under [Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450] subdivision (a) is
granted, the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and
against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated, unless
the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).)¿¿¿¿ 
 
            With
regard to a motion to compel further responses to interrogatories and requests
for production, Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.310 provide
that sanctions shall be awarded against any party, person or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel further responses, unless the Court finds
that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or
that other circumstances make the imposition of sanctions unjust.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c); 2031.310, subd. (h).) 
 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            A. (September 21, 2023 Tentative Ruling)
 
            Compel
PMK Depo    
 
            Plaintiffs
properly noticed Caramedix’s PMK deposition on four occasions and Caramedix has
yet to produce a person most knowledgeable for deposition or the documents
requested in the deposition notice.  Caramedix
argues this motion should be denied for two reasons.  First, defense counsel has finally identified
Caramedix’s person(s) most knowledgeable and will work with plaintiffs’ counsel
to complete the deposition.  Further,
Caramedix agrees to provide responses to the production requests.  As such, counsel for Caramedix does not
oppose producing a PMK for deposition or providing responsive documents.  Second, the deposition categories are overbroad
and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence.  
 
            Both
arguments fail.  No doubt, complications
with one’s client complicate matters, but are no justification for the delay
and is of little solace to opposing counsel.  Plaintiffs have tried to schedule Caramedix’s
PMK deposition since December of 2021. 
Plaintiffs are entitled to this discovery.  Given this history, a Court order is
warranted.
 
            Second, Caramedix’s
objections to the deposition categories are boilerplate and lack merit.  The PMK categories seek basic information
relevant to the prosecution of this case, such as information about the
incident, the driver’s employment status, driving history, and training, policies
and procedures for securing wheel-chair bound clients, the condition of the
subject transport van, and communications and reports regarding the
incident.  These categories are
reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence; they are
not overbroad. 
 
            Based on
the foregoing, Plaintiffs are entitled to an order compelling Caramedix to
provide person(s) most knowledgeable for deposition and to provide responsive
documents to the documents requested in the deposition notice.  
            
            Compel
Further Responses to Discovery[1]
 
            Plaintiffs
seek further responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. 2,
3, 7-11, 13, 16-17, 19-20, 28-30, 33-35, 41, 43, 45-53, and 54-56, Form
Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 12.1-12.3, 15.1, and 16.1-16.5,[2] and Special
Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 1-4, 6-14, 16-22, 24-31, and 33- 35.  
 
            Caramedix
argues these motions should be denied for the same reasons discussed
above.  Defense counsel lost contact with
Caramedix’s representative and could not obtain verifications for the discovery
responses.  The argument lacks
merit.  Defense counsel’s inability to
contact their client has no bearing on whether Plaintiffs are entitled to discovery
sought.  Given that Plaintiffs propounded
this discovery on December 20, 2021, it is not clear Caramedix will provide
responses to Plaintiffs’ discovery absent a court order. 
 
            1. Request
for Production of Documents
            
            Caramedix
asserted meritless objections to the Requests for Production.  Such responses are not code compliant.  The production requests seek relevant
information that are sufficiently limited in time and scope.  To the extent Caramedix asserts an objection
based on privilege, Caramedix has not provided a privilege log showing that
Plaintiffs’ discovery request intrudes upon the privilege.  
 
            Accordingly,
the motion is GRANTED as to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos.
2, 3, 7-11, 13, 16-17, 19-20, 28-30, 33-35, 41, 43, 45-53, and 54-56.
 
            2.  Form
Interrogatories
            
            Section
2030.220(a) requires responses to each interrogatory “to the extent possible”
which are “as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably
available” to the responding party.¿ 
 
            Here, Caramedix
asserted meritless objections and incomplete responses to Form Interrogatories
12.3 and 15.1.¿ Such responses are not code compliant.¿ The Form
Interrogatories, propounded in December of 2021, are not overbroad or premature.  
 
            As such,
the motion as to Form Interrogatory Nos. 12.3 and 15.1 is granted.
 
            3.  Special Interrogatories
 
            Caramedix
asserted meritless objections to the Special Interrogatories.  Such responses are not code compliant.  The Special Interrogatories are sufficiently
limited and not overbroad.  Caramedix’s objections
based on the intrusion of privacy of the driver (Robert Villa) involved in the
underlying incident also lack merit.  The
assertion of privacy does not overcome the relevancy of the information sought
(driving history and contact information of the driver).
 
            Accordingly,
the motion as to Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 6-14, 16-22, 24-31, and
33- 35 is granted.
 
            B.  (October 4, 2023 Supplemental
Briefing.) 
 
            At the
hearing, counsel for Caramedix cited Hernandez v. Superior Court (2003)
112 Cal.App.4th 285 for the proposition that Caramedix is not required to
produce a privilege log when asserting privilege over a document sought to be
identified by an interrogatory.  In Hernandez,
the trial court ordered the responding party to provide a privilege log with
its responses to interrogatories and requests for production.  The petitioners argued that “the trial court
had no power to impose the same requirements upon a claim for privilege in
response to interrogatories.”  (Hernandez,
112 Cal.App.4th at p. 292.)  The Court of
Appeal reviewed the language of the Civil Discovery Act and agreed that a
privilege log “is unnecessary with regard to answering interrogatories seeking
the identification of documents.” (Id. at p. 293.)  However, the Court of Appeal also noted that
“[i]f an interrogatory asks the responding party to identify a document, an
adequate response must include a description of the document.” (Id.)  As Plaintiff’s supplemental briefing points
out, Caramedix’s responses to the Form and Special Interrogatories are devoid
of any description of a document which it claims to be privileged.    
 
            As
discussed below, while Caramedix’s reliance on Hernandez is correct, its
discovery responses remain deficient.  
 
            Form
Interrogatory No. 12.1
 
            Form
Interrogatory 12.1 seeks the following: “State the name, ADDRESS, and telephone
number of each individual: (a) who witnessed the INCIDENT or the events occurring
immediately before or after the INCIDENT; (b) who made any statement at the
scene of the INCIDENT; (c) who heard any statements made about the INCIDENT by
any individual at the scene; (d) who YOU OR ANYONE ACTING ON YOUR BEHALF claim
has knowledge of the INCIDENT (except for expert witnesses covered by Code of
Civil Procedure section 2034).”
 
            Caramedix
provided the name of the driver (Robert Villa) in response to No. 12.1, but
resists further responses based upon the work product privilege.  In its supplemental brief, Caramedix states:
“Caramedix’s
position as it relates to the attorney work product privilege is consistent
with the Supreme Court’s holding in Coito v. Superior Court (2012) 54 Cal.
4th 480, 502 that names of persons counsel selected to interview and
recorded witness interviews may be protected from disclosure where it would
otherwise reveal the attorney’s evaluation, opinions, and impressions, ‘or
would result in opposing counsel taking undue advantage of the attorney’s
industry or efforts.’ Caramedix does not disagree that per Coito states [sic] a preliminary showing may be required to
substantiate a claim for work product.” (Supplemental Opp., pp. 1-2.)  To state Caramedix’s position is to refute the
adequacy of its responses. 
 
            Caramedix
concedes that Coito requires a preliminary showing to substantiate a
claim for work product.  Plaintiffs argue
Caramedix knows which DaVita employees witnessed the incident.  As such, Caramedix must include the names of
the DaVita employees that purportedly witnessed the accident, or provide
sufficient information to substantiate its invocation of the work product
privilege.  Caramedix failed to make such
a showing when it served its initial response.  Nor has it cured the deficiency despite its
own recognition of the deficiency.    
 
            Accordingly,
the motion as to Form Interrogatory No. 12.1 is granted.
 
            Form
Interrogatory No. 12.2
 
            Form
Interrogatory No. 12.2: “Have YOU OR ANYONE ACTING ON YOUR BEHALF interviewed
any individual concerning the INCIDENT? If so, for each individual state: (a)
the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the individual interviewed; (b) the
date of the interview; and (c) the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the
PERSON who conducted the interview.”
 
            Caramedix
objected to No. 12.2 pursuant to Coito and work product.  No substantive response was provided.  As with 12.1, Caramedix did not and has not
made a preliminary showing to justify its invocation of the work product privilege.  
 
            Accordingly,
the motion as to Form Interrogatory No. 12.2 is granted.
 
            Form Interrogatory
Nos. 16.1-16.5
            
            Caramedix’s
supplemental brief argues it “never took issue with identifying the existence
of a document that is privileged in response to an interrogatory.”  Caramedix’s argument is not well-taken.  Form Interrogatory Nos. 16.1(d), 16.2(c),
16.3(d), 16.4(d), and 16.5(d) each request identification of documents.  In response, Caramedix objected to these
interrogatories “on the grounds that it seeks information protected from
disclosure by the attorney work product doctrine and attorney-client
privilege.”  As discussed above,
this is not an adequate response.  (See Hernandez,
supra, 112 Cal.App.4th at p. 293.)[3]
 At a minimum, Caramedix must provide a
description of the documents.  It did not
and has not.            
 
            Accordingly,
the motion as to Form Interrogatory Nos. 16.1-16.5 is granted.
 
            Special
Interrogatory Nos. 1-4
 
            As with
Form Interrogatory Nos. 12.1, 12.2, and 16.1-16.5, Caramedix asserted objections
to Special Interrogatory Nos. 1-4 based on work product.  Absent a showing to substantiate its claim of work
product, Caramedix’s responses are deficient. 
Caramedix does not offer any argument to the contrary with respect to
Special Interrogatory Nos. 1-4. 
 
            Accordingly,
the motion as to Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 1-4 is granted.
 
            Monetary
Sanctions
 
            Plaintiffs
seek sanctions against Caramedix in connection with the foregoing motions.  As Caramedix has opposed these motions
without substantial justification, sanctions are warranted.  (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.450, subd. (g)(1); 2030.290, subd. (c); 2031.310, subd.
(h).)  Accordingly, sanctions are
imposed against Caramedix in the total sum of $2,480, consisting of 4 hours at
plaintiffs’ counsel’s hourly rate, 2 hours at plaintiffs’ counsel’s paralegal’s
hourly rate, and $180 in filing fees.
