Summary:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiffs' fifth and sixth causes of action is sustained with leave to amend. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants were negligent in repairing their vehicle and that the defendants fraudulently concealed the defects in the vehicle. The judge found that the plaintiffs' allegations were insufficient to state a cause of action for negligent repair and that the defendants' demurrer was sustained with leave to amend. The judge also found that the plaintiffs' allegations of fraudulent concealment were insufficient to state a cause of action and that the defendants' demurrer was sustained with leave to amend. The judge gave the plaintiffs 30 days to amend their complaint.
