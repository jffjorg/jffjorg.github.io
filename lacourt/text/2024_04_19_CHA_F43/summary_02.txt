The Judge orders the parties to conduct a meaningful meet and confer, rather than relying on email or letter. The Judge also orders the parties to file a joint statement of remaining issues, which should describe the matters in dispute and the parties' arguments for and against compelling further responses. The Judge sets the dates for a status report and continued hearings and requires the moving party to provide notice.
