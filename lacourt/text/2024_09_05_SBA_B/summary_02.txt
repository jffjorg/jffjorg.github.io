And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is inclined to grant the petitions filed by plaintiff Nolvia Corea Castillo to approve the compromise of pending action on behalf of minor claimants Genesis Orantes Corea and Mauricio Orantes Corea. The petitions seek approval of a settlement agreement in which each claimant will receive $8,000, which will be allocated towards medical expenses, attorney's fees, and a blocked trust account. The court notes that the settlement terms appear to be fair and reasonable, and that the claimants have recovered completely from their injuries. The court also finds good cause to dispense with the appearance of the minors at the hearing due to the amount in settlement.
