And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion for a writ of attachment and right to attach order. The plaintiffs, TRE D, Inc. and Wilson, are seeking to secure their claims for breach of construction agreement, unjust enrichment, and foreclosure of mechanic's lien arising from the defendants' failure to pay for construction and repair work on three projects in Malibu. The judge found that the plaintiffs' claims are secured by real property, as they have already recorded a mechanic's lien on the properties, and therefore a writ of attachment is not permitted under California Code of Civil Procedure §483.010. The judge also found that the plaintiffs have not established the probable validity of their underlying claims.
