Youell v. Fink, Case no. 23SMCV04847
Hearing date November 25, 2024
Defendant’s
Motions for Leave of Court to Conduct Further Medical Examinations
Plaintiffs
Youell and Crowe sue for injuries arising out of a motor vehicle incident. Defendant
previously served demands for orthopedic independent medical exams and seeks
neurological IMEs. The motions are unopposed and supported by the declaration
of defense counsel Lyon.
Cal.
Code Civ. Proc. §2032.020(a) permits parties to conduct discovery “by means of
a physical or mental examination . . . in any action in which the mental or
physical condition . . . of that party or other person is in controversy in the
action.”  In an action where a plaintiff
is seeking recovery for personal injuries, any defendant may demand one
physical examination of the plaintiff. The court shall grant a motion for
additional physical examinations where good cause is shown. Cal. Code Civ.
Proc. §2032.320(a). 
Defendant
argues plaintiffs have placed their neurological status in controversy by
alleging neurological injuries as a result of the incident. Decl. Lyon para. 4,
exh. B. Defendant argues further medical exams would be non-invasive and set
within Los Angeles county for plaintiffs’ convenience. Defendant has
demonstrated good cause, and plaintiffs do not oppose. GRANTED.
