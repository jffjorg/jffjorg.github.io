```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to vacate the stipulated judgment and subsequent order of assignment. The defendants, including Schenz, argue that the stipulated judgment was obtained through extrinsic fraud or mistake, but the judge finds that Schenz's declaration is hearsay and lacks sufficient evidence or explanation to support his allegations. Additionally, the judge notes that the defendants are outside the jurisdictional time limit for filing a motion to vacate the stipulated judgment under CCP ยง473(b). The judge concludes that there is no basis for granting the requested relief.
