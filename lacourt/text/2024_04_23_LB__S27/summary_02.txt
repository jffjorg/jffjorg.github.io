And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by the defendant to the plaintiff's third amended complaint. The plaintiff filed the complaint as an unlawful detainer action, but later amended it to state a claim for breach of contract for unpaid rent. The court granted the plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint. The defendant argued that the complaint was unlawfully converted from an unlawful detainer action to a civil action, and that the defendant failed to pay rent. The court overruled the demurrer, finding that the complaint states a valid claim for relief. The court also denied the defendant's motion to strike. The defendant is ordered to file an answer to the complaint within ten days.
