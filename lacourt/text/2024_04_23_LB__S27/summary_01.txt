And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a motion to compel further responses to RFAs (Request for Admissions) and a motion to compel further responses to RPDs (Request for Production of Documents). The plaintiff, Mary Wilson, filed the motion to compel further responses to RFAs, alleging that the defendant, Rodger Wilson, failed to respond to her requests for admissions. The defendant filed an opposition to the motion, arguing that the plaintiff's claims are time-barred and that the plaintiff is attempting to enforce a superseded partnership agreement.

The court finds that the defendant's responses to the RFAs are sufficient and that no further responses are necessary at this time. The court also finds that the defendant failed to respond to the plaintiff's meet and confer letter and failed to serve any response to FROG 17.1, which necessitated the filing of this motion. Therefore, the court imposes sanctions on the defendant and his attorney in the amount of $1860.

The court also takes the motion to compel further responses to RPDs off calendar, as it has become moot. The parties are reminded that there is a case management conference on calendar concurrently with the hearing on the above motions.
