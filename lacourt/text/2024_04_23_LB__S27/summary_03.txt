Superior Court (2023) 15 Cal.5th 40 and has decided to grant the defendant's motion. The court has ordered the parties to meet and confer to discuss discovery and to consider the recent ruling in Doe. The court has also ordered the parties to negotiate a protective order to ensure the strictest privacy safeguards as to the discovery sought. The motion to compel is granted, and the parties must work together to stipulate to any necessary protective order.
