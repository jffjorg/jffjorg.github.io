And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion of Jeffrey L. Fayngor, counsel for Plaintiff Keanna Cecilia Camberos, to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The motion was filed on September 30, 2024, and was unopposed. The judge found sufficient grounds for permitting withdrawal, citing a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and the client's conduct that renders it unreasonably difficult for the lawyer to carry out the representation effectively. However, the judge denied the motion due to counsel's failure to serve the plaintiff with the motion papers on time and the incomplete proposed order. The judge ordered counsel to give notice of the ruling within five calendar days.
