And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion for relief from waiver of objections filed by the defendant, Glendora Unified School District, to the written discovery requests served by the plaintiffs, Jane Doe and Jane GA Doe. The defendant had initially failed to timely respond to the discovery requests, but later provided verified responses in May 2024. The judge finds that the defendant's failure to timely respond was due to inadvertence or mistake caused by issues with emails and the requests not being sent to the right person at the defendant's counsel's firm. The judge also notes that the plaintiffs gave the defendant very little time to address their untimely responses before filing the underlying discovery motions. The judge concludes that the defendant's responses to the discovery requests are substantially compliant with the Code of Civil Procedure and that the defendant is entitled to relief from waiver of objections. The judge orders the defendant to provide notice of the ruling within five calendar days of the order.
