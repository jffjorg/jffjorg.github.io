NAME:  Keanna
Cecilia Camberos v. Demitric Gomez Lomeli, et al. 
Motion
of Jeffrey L. Fayngor to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Keanna Cecilia
Camberos 
TENTATIVE RULING 
The Court DENIES the motion of Jeffrey L. Fayngor to be relieved
as counsel for Plaintiff Keanna Cecilia Camberos without prejudice. 
            Counsel Jeffrey L. Fayngor is
ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this
order. 
BACKGROUND 
This is a personal injury action. On August 5, 2024, plaintiff Keanna
Cecilia Camberos (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Demitric
Gomez Lomeli, Irma Lomeli Frias (collectively, Defendants) and Does 1 through
20, alleging one cause of action for motor vehicle accident negligence. 
On September 30, 2024, counsel Jeffrey L. Fayngor of The JLF Firm
moved to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff. The motion is unopposed. 
LEGAL
STANDARD 
The Court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted, provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.)
A motion to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council
Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the client and on all parties
that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362, subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION 
            Jeffrey L.
Fayngor of The JLF Firm (Counsel) seeks to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff
on the grounds that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship. (Fayngor Decl., ¶ 2.) 
            The Court
finds sufficient grounds for permitting withdrawal here. Grounds for permitting
an attorney to withdraw from representation include the client’s conduct that,
“renders it unreasonably difficult for the lawyer to carry out the
representation effectively[.]” (Cal. Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1.16,
subd. (b)(4).) A breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is also grounds
for allowing the attorney to withdraw. (Estate of Falco (1987) 188
Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.) Counsel has also submitted the application,
declaration, and proposed order on Judicial Council forms MC-051, MC-052, and
MC-053. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).)          
            However,
Counsel’s proof of service filed with the Court on October 11, 2024, indicates
that Counsel served Plaintiff with the moving papers for this motion by mail on
October 10, 2024. (Proof of Service (10/11/24).) The deadline to complete
service was September 30, 2024. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b); Id.,
§ 1013, subd. (a).) Counsel’s motion is therefore untimely. 
            The Court also
notes that paragraph 6 of the proposed order, which requires the client’s
current or last known address and telephone number, is blank. (Proposed Order,
¶ 6.) The Court further notes that Counsel cited an outdated section of the
Rules of Professional Conduct regarding termination of the attorney-client
relationship. (Fayngor Decl., ¶ 2.) The current rule governing termination of
attorney-client relationships is Rule 1.16. (Cal. Rules of Professional
Conduct, rule 1.16.) 
            Based on the
foregoing, the Court DENIES the motion without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court DENIES the motion of Jeffrey L. Fayngor to be relieved
as counsel for Plaintiff Keanna Cecilia Camberos without prejudice. 
            Counsel Jeffrey L. Fayngor is
ordered to give notice of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this
order.
