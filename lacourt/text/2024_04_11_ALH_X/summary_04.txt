And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

**Tentative Ruling**

The court denies the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, which seeks to prevent the city from enforcing Ordinances 1854 and 1856. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of her claims. The plaintiff argues that the ordinances are invalid because they are preempted by state laws, but the court finds that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a reason that Civil Code section 1947 preempts the city's ordinances. The court also finds that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate irreparable injury and that the balance of harm weighs in favor of the city. The hearing on the demurrer is continued, and the plaintiff is ordered to file an appropriate opposition to the demurrer and motion to strike nine days prior to the continued hearing date.
