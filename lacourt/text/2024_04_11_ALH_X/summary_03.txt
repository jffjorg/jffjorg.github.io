And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Trader Joe's Company, has moved for an order to reclassify the present action as a limited jurisdiction case. The court grants the motion. The defendant has demonstrated that the plaintiff's current damages are below the $25,000 threshold and that the plaintiff likely does not have any additional damages. The defendant had also shown good cause for not seeking reclassification earlier, citing ongoing discovery and attempts to initiate settlement discussions. The plaintiff has not opposed the present motion.
