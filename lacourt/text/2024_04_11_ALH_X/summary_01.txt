And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by Judge Joel L. Lofton denies Defendant's counsel's motion to set aside the order imposing sanctions. The sanctions were originally set at $3,000, but are reduced to $2,000 due to the lack of notice to Defendant's counsel. The dispute arose from Defendant's counsel's mistaken filing of a dismissal request and failure to appear for a hearing. The court finds that Defendant's counsel's actions were not reasonable and constitute neither excusable neglect nor mistake. Despite this, the court reduces the sanctions amount due to the lack of notice.
