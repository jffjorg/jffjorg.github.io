And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant 7-Eleven, Inc.'s motion to compel further responses to its form interrogatories. The Plaintiff, Maria Ayala, is ordered to provide further responses to form interrogatories numbers 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, and 11.1 within twenty days of the date of the order. The Judge notes that Defendant provided deficient responses to its form interrogatories on December 15, 2023, and that Plaintiff's contention that Defendant failed to properly meet and confer prior to filing the motion is not supported by evidence. The Judge also notes that Plaintiff may have cited Rule 3.31 applicable to courts in the County of Alameda, but it appears that this rule is not applicable in this case.
