RELIEF
REQUESTED 
 
             Defendant moves for an order
reclassifying this case as an action of limited jurisdiction. 
 
BACKGROUND
 
             This case arises out of Plaintiff’s claim she
slipped and fell at Trader Joe’s store located at 103 E. Glenoaks Boulevard,
Glendale, California, 91207. Plaintiff filed this complaint on January 24,
2023.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Defendant’s motion for an order
reclassifying the present action as a limited jurisdiction case is GRANTED.
 
DISCUSSION
 
             Defendant moves for an order
reclassifying this case as an action of limited jurisdiction.  
“If a party files
a motion for reclassification after the time for that party to amend that party's initial pleading or to respond
to a complaint, cross-complaint, or other initial pleading, the court shall
grant the motion and enter an order for reclassification only if both of the
following conditions are satisfied: [¶] (1) The case is
incorrectly classified. [¶] (2) The moving
party shows good cause for not seeking reclassification earlier.” (Code of Civ.
Proc. § 403.040.)
            Defendant provides that
Plaintiff has billed $9,815.00 in medical care expenses. (Free Decl. ¶ 4.) Defendant provides that Plaintiff stated
during her deposition that she has not sought medical for her injuries since
2021 and has no future appointments scheduled. (Id. ¶ 5.) Defendant also
provides that Plaintiff stated she is not seeking recovery for loss of
earnings, future earnings, or property damage. (Id. ¶ 6.) 
 
            The
statutory definition of a limited civil case includes “[a] case at law
in which the demand, exclusive of interest, or the value of the property in
controversy amounts to twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) or less.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 86.) 
 
            Here,
Defendant has demonstrated that Plaintiff’s current damages are below the
$25,000 threshold and that Plaintiff likely does not have any additional
damages. Defendant had demonstrated that the amount in controversy is less than
$25,000. Further, Defendant provides that the motion was not made earlier
because discovery was still ongoing and because Defendant had tried to initiate
settlement discussion. (Free
Decl. ¶ 7.) Defendant has shown good
cause for not seeking reclassification earlier. Plaintiff has not opposed the
present motion. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendant’s motion for an order
reclassifying the present action as a limited jurisdiction case is GRANTED.
