And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer in part as to the fourth cause of action (breach of mandatory duty to report suspected child abuse) with 20 days leave to amend, and overrules the demurrer on all other grounds. The court finds that the complaint fails to state a cause of action as to the fifth cause of action (negligent failure to warn, train, or educate). The ruling is based on the California Constitution, California Civil Code, California Government Code, and California Education Code. The court also relies on previous cases, including West Contra Costa Unified School District v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County and Doe v. Baldwin Park Unified School District. The ruling is significant because it addresses the issue of liability for a public entity's failure to report suspected child abuse and the duty to warn, train, or educate students about sexual abuse.
