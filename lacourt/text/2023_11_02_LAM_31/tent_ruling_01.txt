  Case Number:  19STCV25754    Hearing Date:   November 2, 2023    Dept:  31 TENTATIVE   Plaintiff’s motion  to set aside is DENIED.   Pencor’s unopposed motions  to intervene and expunge the lis pendens are GRANTED. The notice of lis pendens  recorded on 732 117th St., Los Angeles, CA 90044 is EXPUNGED.  Plaintiff and is  ordered to pay attorney’s fees and costs of $2,210 to Pencor’s counsel within  30 days of this order.     Legal  Standard    Motion to  Set Aside Dismissal   Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b) provides for  mandatory and discretionary relief from dismissal.  “The court may, upon  any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative  from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him through  his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.”  CCP §473(b).  Where such an  application for discretionary relief is made, the motion shall be accompanied  by a copy of the answer or pleading  proposed to be filed, or the application will not be granted.  (Id.)  The court must  grant relief from dismissal where the application  is accompanied by an attorney affidavit attesting to his or her mistake,  inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.  (Id.)  In either case,  the application must be made within a reasonable time, and in no case exceeding  six months after the judgment.  (Id.)   Leave  to Intervene  CCP section 387(d) provides the  following:  (1) The  court shall, upon timely application, permit a nonparty to intervene in the  action or proceeding if either of the following conditions is satisfied:  (A) A provision of law confers an unconditional right to  intervene.  (B)  The person seeking intervention claims an interest relating to the property or  transaction that is the subject of the action and that person is so situated  that the disposition of the action may impair or impede that person’s ability  to protect that interest, unless that person’s interest is adequately  represented by one or more of the existing parties.  (2) The  court may, upon timely application, permit a nonparty to intervene in the  action or proceeding if the person has an interest in the matter in litigation,  or in the success of either of the parties, or an interest against both.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 387(d).) Expunge  Lis Pendens Any party or a  non-party having an interest in the property affected by a notice of lis  pendens may move for expungement any time after the lis pendens is  recorded. However, a  person who is not a party to the action shall obtain leave to intervene from  the court at or before the time the party brings the motion to expunge the  notice.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 405.30.)  A lis pendens must be  removed for being improper on account of: (a) the¿pleading on which the notice  is based not containing a real property claim, assuming the allegations to be  true, (Code Civ. Proc. § 405.31; Urez Corp. v. Superior Court (1987) 190  Cal.App.3d 1141, 1149), or (b) the claimant not being able to establish by a  preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the real property claim  (Code Civ. Proc. § 405.32; Ziello v. Superior Court (1995) 36  Cal.App.4th 321, 331-32.)   A “real property  claim” means the cause or causes of action in a pleading which would, if  meritorious, affect: (a) title to, or the right to possession of, specific real  property, or (b) the use of an easement identified in the pleading, other than  an easement obtained pursuant to statute by any regulated public utility.   (Code Civ. Proc. § 405.4.)    Pursuant to Code  of Civil Procedure section 405.32, “the court shall order that the notice be  expunged if the court finds that the claimant has not established by a  preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the real property  claim.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 405.32.)  The claimant, not the moving  party, has the burden of proof to establish a valid real property claim and  likelihood of success.  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 405.30, 405.31, 405.32; Malcolm  v. Superior Court (1981) 29 Cal.3d 518, 525-26.)  Only admissible or  verified evidence is permitted on the motion.  (See Burger v.  Superior Court (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 1013, 1019.)  To carry the burden  on a motion to expunge lis pendens, the moving party, “must ‘at least  establish a prima facie case.  If the defendant makes an appearance, the  court must then consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective  parties and make a determination of the probable  outcome of the litigation.’”  (Howard S. Wright Construction Co. v.  Superior Court (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 314, 319.)  Moreover,“‘[p]robable validity,’ in  connection with a real property claim, means that it is more likely than not  that the claimant will obtain a judgment against the defendant on the  claim.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 405.3; see also Code Civ. Proc. § 481.190 [“A  claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is more likely than not that the  plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant on that  claim.”].)      “Once a notice of  pending action has been expunged, the claimant may not record another notice of  pending action as to the affected property without leave of the court in which  the action is pending.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 405.36.)    “The court shall  direct that the party prevailing on any motion [to expunge lis pendens] be  awarded the reasonable attorney's fees and costs of making or opposing the  motion unless the court finds that the other party acted with substantial  justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of attorney's  fees and costs unjust.” (CCP § 405.38.)    Request for  Judicial Notice   “Judicial notice may not be taken of  any matter unless authorized or required by law.” (Evid. Code § 450.)  The  court may take judicial notice of official acts of the legislative, executive,  and judicial departments of the United States and of any state, as well as  records of any court of this state or another state.  (Evid. Code §  452(c)-(d).)  The court may take judicial notice of a recorded deed as an  official act of the state’s executive branch.  (Ragland v. US Bank  Nat’l Ass’n. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 182, 194; West v. JPMorgan Chase  Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 803.)  The court is not  mandated to accept the truth of the judicially noticed document’s contents or  the parties’ interpretation of those contents.  (Joslin v. H.A.S. Ins.  Brokerage (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374.)      Pencor requests judicial notice of the following: (1) the first amended complaint in this case; (2) “Trustee’s Deed Upon Sale” recorded on  February 22, 2023, in the Official Records of the County of Los Angeles as  document number 20230112383; (3) “Notice of Pendency” recorded on August 7,  2019, in the Official Records of the County of Los Angeles as document number  20190786556; (4) “Notice of Claim of Ownership,” filed on or about July 3,  2023, in this case; and (5) “Minute Order” dismissing amended complaint, filed  on or about July 3, 2023 in this case.   Pencor’s request for judicial notice is  GRANTED.   Discussion   1.      Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal First, Plaintiff moves to set  aside the dismissal. The case was dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Court  of Civil Procedure section 581(b)(3) on July 3, 2023.  Plaintiff filed the  subject motion on July 13, 2023. which was within six months of entry of the  dismissal, and thus, the subject motion is timely.  (See Code Civ. Proc.,  § 473(b).)    Next, the Court  notes that Plaintiff seeks relief under the discretionary portion of section  473(b), as it does not attribute fault to her attorney, and therefore cannot  move under the mandatory prong. The Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to  make any showing of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Rather,  she simply expresses her frustration over her former counsel. Thus, the Court  cannot grant the motion to set aside dismissal.   2.     Pencor’s Motion to  Intervene   Second,  Pencor, Inc. moves to intervene in this matter in order for the Court to hear  its motion to expunge the lis pendens. Arguably, dismissal of the action  deprived this Court of jurisdiction over the instant matter. Notwithstanding  the general principle that dismissal of an action deprives the Court of  jurisdiction, this Court finds that it may act to expunge a lis pendens arising  from the action, as is specifically provided for by CCP § 405.30. (See Cornell  v. Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (E.D. Cal., Nov. 29, 2011, No. CIV  S-11-1462 KJM) 2011 WL 6097721 at *2 (applying California law) [finding  jurisdiction to expunge lis pendens under CCP § 405.30 because otherwise “any  person could hypothetically cloud title in perpetuity by maintaining a lis  pendens on real property even after the claims upon which the lis pendens is  filed have been dismissed and are no longer pending”].)  In accordance with CCP § 405.30, Pencor  as a non-party seeks to intervene so that it can move to expunge the lis  pendens recorded against the subject property. With respect to Pencor’s motion  to intervene, the Court concludes that Pencor has an interest in the subject  property. Pencor purchased the property at a nonjudicial foreclosure sale. (RJN  Ex. 2; Ex. 4.) Following the Court’s dismissal of her first amended complaint  (“FAC”), Plaintiff refused to voluntarily withdraw the lis pendens that  is placing a cloud on Pencor’s title. (Meleski Decl. ¶ 5.) Intervention by  Pencor is therefore appropriate. (CCP § 387(d)(1)(B).)  3.      Pencor’s Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens As for expungement of the lis pendens,  because the action was dismissed on July 3, 2023, plaintiff no longer has a  real property claim. Moreover, this Court previously sustained a demurrer  without leave to amend due to the claims regarding the property being  time-barred. Additionally, despite proper notice, plaintiff did not file an  opposition. Accordingly, plaintiff has not met her burden to establish the  existence of a real property claim, or likelihood of success. The claimant, not the moving party, has the burden of proof  to establish a valid real property claim and likelihood of success.  (Code  Civ. Proc. §§ 405.30, 405.31, 405.32; Malcolm v. Superior Court (1981)  29 Cal.3d 518, 525-26.)  Accordingly, the motion to expunge the lis  pendens is granted.                 Request  for Attorney’s Fees Pursuant to CCP § 405.38, because Pencor  has prevailed, the Court awards Pencor reasonable attorney fees and costs. Pencor  requests attorney fees for 6.2 hours of time drafting this motion, 2 hours for  preparing and attending the hearing, and another 2 hours to review the  opposition and draft a reply, at $350 per hour. Plaintiff is ordered to pay  intervenor Pencor $2,210 (6.2 hours for preparing motion as requested and 1  hour preparing for and attending hearing (instead of 2 hours requested) and  removing another 2 hours as there is no opposition and no reply) at $350 per  hour, plus $40 in filing fees), payable to Pencor’s counsel within 30 days of  this order. The Court has no basis to find that sanctions would be unjust in  light of the lack of opposition. Conclusion   Based on the  foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion to set aside is DENIED.   Pencor’s motions  to intervene and expunge the lis pendens are GRANTED. The notice of lis pendens  recorded on 732 117th St., Los Angeles, CA 90044 is EXPUNGED.  Plaintiff and is  ordered to pay attorney’s fees and costs of $2,210 to Pencor’s counsel within  30 days of this order.     Moving party is  ordered to give notice.
