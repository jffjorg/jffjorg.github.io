The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect." (CCP § 473(b))
The court shall, upon timely application, permit a nonparty to intervene in the action or proceeding if either of the following conditions is satisfied: (CCP § 387(d))
Any party or a non-party having an interest in the property affected by a notice of lis pendens may move for expungement any time after the lis pendens is recorded. (Code Civ. Proc. § 405.30)

Superior Court (1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 1141, 1149), or (b) the claimant not being able to establish by a preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the real property claim (Code Civ.
