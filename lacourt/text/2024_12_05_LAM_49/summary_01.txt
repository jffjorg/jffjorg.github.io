And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the motion to quash service of summons and complaint filed by specially-appearing defendant Antonio Luis Augusto. The defendant claims that he was not the person served at the Hawthorne address, and that the process server mistakenly served a younger individual with a similar name. The defendant provides evidence that he was residing in Brazil at the time of the purported service, and provides a photocopy of his Brazilian ID as proof of residency. The plaintiff did not oppose the motion. Based on the evidence presented, the Judge finds that the service was ineffective on the defendant and grants the motion to quash service of summons and complaint.
