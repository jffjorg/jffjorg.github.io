And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petition to approve the compromise of the pending action of a minor, Pablo Santiago Tomas, for several reasons. Firstly, the written attorney fee agreement was not provided in Attachment 14a. Secondly, the request for "Costs" in Item 14(b) is unclear and the court is unable to determine the difference between this request and the other item for "Administrative Costs". The court requests that the petitioner specifically itemize the type of expenses incurred. Additionally, the court requires Attachment 18a to identify and explain the relationship between the attorney and the other party involved in the matter. Finally, the name of the petitioner provided on page 7 of MC-350 is incorrect. The petitioner is ordered to file a new petition curing these defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date.
