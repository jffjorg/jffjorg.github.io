The judge orders the petitioner to file an Order Approving Compromise of Claim (MC-351) for each minor claimant and to reserve a new date and file a new petition curing the defects at least 9 court days before the continued hearing date. The settlement agreement for $5,000 will be denied unless the defects are cured.
