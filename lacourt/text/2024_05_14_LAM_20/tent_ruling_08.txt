This is a medical malpractice action.  Defendant Shuo Wang seeks a determination that his settlement with Plaintiffs Ana and Luis Cordova was made in good faith pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. § 877.6.Because no oppositions were filed, the Motions may be granted without consideration of the Tech-Bilt factors and on the basis of setting forth the ground for good faith determination and a brief background of the case.  (See City of Grand Terrace v. Superior Court (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1251, 1261 [“[W]e . . . conclude that only when the good faith nature of a settlement is disputed, it is incumbent upon the trial court to consider and weigh the Tech-Bilt factors. That is to say, when no one objects, the barebones motion which sets forth the ground of good faith, accompanied by a declaration which sets forth a brief background of the case is sufficient.”)  Plaintiffs claim that Defendants’ negligent surgery and post-surgery evaluation led to paraplegia for Plaintiff Ana Cordova and loss of consortium of Luis Cordova.  Wang will exchange $750,000 for a release of Plaintiffs’ claims.  Wang’s policy limit was $1 million.  The parties will bear their own costs.  Wang indicates that he was confident in the standard of care he provided.Under the circumstances, the Court cannot find that “the settlement is so far ‘out of the ballpark’ in relation to [the Tech-Bilt] factors as to be inconsistent with the equitable objectives of the statute.”  (Tech-Bilt, Inc., supra, 38 Cal.3d at pp. 499–500.)  Accordingly, the Court finds that the settlement was made in good faith.  The Motion is granted.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
