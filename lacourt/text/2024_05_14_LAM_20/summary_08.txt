Here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling discusses a medical malpractice action brought by Ana and Luis Cordova against Shuo Wang. The Court is asked to determine whether Wang's settlement with the Plaintiffs was made in good faith, as required by Code Civ. Proc. § 877.6. The Plaintiffs claim that Wang's negligent surgery and post-surgery evaluation led to paraplegia for Ana Cordova and loss of consortium of Luis Cordova. Wang will exchange $750,000 for a release of the Plaintiffs' claims. Since no oppositions were filed, the Court can grant the Motion without considering the Tech-Bilt factors, as long as the good faith nature of the settlement is set forth and a brief background of the case is provided. The Court finds that the settlement was made in good faith, as it is not "out of the ballpark" in relation to the Tech-Bilt factors. The Motion is granted, and the parties will bear their own costs.
