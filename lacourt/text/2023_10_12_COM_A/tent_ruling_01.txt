[TENTATIVE]
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME
 
            Petitioner, HANIF
AKIL-MATSIMELA CARTER, requests an order to change the capitalization of Petitioner’s
name from all capital letters to initial capital letters (“Hanif Akil-Matsimela
Carter”). The Court has discretion to
deny the petition where “there are substantial and principled reasons for
denying [it].  … (In re Ross (1937) 8
Cal.2d 608, 610, 67 P.2d 94 [need some substantial reason for denial]; Lee v.
Superior Court, supra, 9 Cal.App.4th at p. 515, 11 Cal.Rptr.2d 763 [court may
properly deny petition if name adopted to defraud, intentionally confuse, or
intrude into someone's privacy or violate recognized public policy.” (In re Arnett (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 654, 661). 
            At
common law, a person’s name consists of a given name and a surname or family
name. A person’s name "is the distinctive characterization in words
by which he is known and distinguished from others.” (In re Ritchie (1984) 159 Cal.App.3d 1070, 1073). The requested change in capitalization alone is
not a name change and is also confusing. (Matter of Yates 2022 ND 11, ¶ 5 [Changing a name from all capital letters to initial capital letters
followed by lower case letters is not a change from one name to another name.])
Accordingly, the application is DENIED.
