Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is inclined to grant the plaintiff's request for an interlocutory judgment for partition by sale and appointment of a referee. The plaintiff and defendant own an undivided one-half interest in real property as tenants in common. The plaintiff has submitted a recorded deed transferring her 50% interest to her revocable trust, and the defendant has also transferred her 50% interest to her revocable trust. The judge will appoint a referee to manage the property and conduct the sale. The referee will be required to post a bond of $5,000 within four days of the judgment being entered. The referee will also be authorized to take possession of the property, demand and collect market rents, and manage the property until the sale is completed. The judge will review the referee's report and confirm the sale.
