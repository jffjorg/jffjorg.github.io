And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for continuance in a case filed on July 30, 2024. The plaintiff, Rita Rodriguez, is seeking to advance the Case Management Conference (CMC) to an earlier date due to concerns that the defendant (who has not been identified) may use the extra time to bribe witnesses and destroy evidence. The plaintiff has not served any of the named defendants and has failed to comply with the rules requiring service within 60 days of filing the complaint. The judge finds that the motion is not supported by law or facts and denies it. The plaintiff is ordered to appear at a hearing on April 3, 2025, to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed for their failure to timely serve all named defendants.
