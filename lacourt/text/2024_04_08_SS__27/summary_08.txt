And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Javier Giron, has moved to strike certain portions of the plaintiff's complaint, including the prayer for punitive damages and the damages amount of $814,488.06. The plaintiff failed to file an amended complaint with a claim for punitive damages after agreeing to do so, and the defendant's motion to strike was unopposed. The court grants the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages and damages amount, with leave to amend. The plaintiff must plead specific facts with a clear and convincing showing of malice to support a claim for punitive damages. If the plaintiff decides to amend the complaint, the court will require specific facts and a clear and convincing showing of malice.
