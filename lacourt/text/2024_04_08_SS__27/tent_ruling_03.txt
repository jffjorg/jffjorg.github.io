Case No./Name:       21STCV20836 JORDAN WALKER, AN INDIVIDUAL vs
ANZA MANAGEMENT COMPANY
Motion:                    MOTIONS TO QUASH SERVICE
Moving Party:           Defendant Lankershim Apts
Responding Party:    Plaintiff
Notice:                      Sufficient
 
Ruling:                              MOTIONS TO QUASH SERVICE ARE GRANTED 
Background
On June 3, 2021,
Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendants Anza Management Company and
Academy Pointe Apartments. On April 28, 2023, Plaintiff amended the Complaint
to correctly name Academy Point Apartments as Lankershim Apts., Inc.
(“Lankershim”).  Defendant Lankershim (“Defendant”)
now moves the Court to quash Plaintiff's two previous attempts at serving
Lankershim. Plaintiff's first attempt occurred on August 23, 2023, where a copy
of the summons and complaint was left at the address of Defendant’s agent for
service of process. No proof of service was filed for this attempt, and
Defendant claims that it did not receive a copy of the summons and complaint in
the mail as required by CCP § 415.20. 
Plaintiff’s
second attempt occurred on September 26, 2023, where Plaintiff personally
served Preet Desai, who the process server indicates was served as substitute service
for the agent for service of Lankershim. 
On October 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of service related to the
September 26 attempted service. 
Apparently, a
third attempt was made on February 27, 2024. 
No motion has been brought regarding that third attempt.  As best the Court can tell, that third
attempt was appropriately made by substituted service.  
Legal Standard  
C.C.P.
§416.10 provides, as follows:
A summons may
be served on a corporation by delivering a copy of the summons and the
complaint by any of the following methods:
(a) To the
person designated as agent for service of process as provided by any provision
in Section 202, 1502, 2105, or 2107 of the Corporations Code (or Sections 3301
to 3303, inclusive, or Sections 6500 to 6504, inclusive, of the Corporations
Code, as in effect on December 31, 1976, with respect to corporations to which
they remain applicable).
(b) To the
president, chief executive officer, or other head of the corporation, a vice
president, a secretary or assistant secretary, a treasurer or assistant
treasurer, a controller or chief financial officer, a general manager, or a
person authorized by the corporation to receive service of process.
Plaintiff can
effectuate personal service under CCP § 415.10 through personal delivery of a
copy of the summons and the complaint to the person to be served. In the case
of corporations, service can be made on an individual designated under CCP §  416.10(a) or (b). Service of a summons in
this manner is deemed complete at the time of delivery.
“When a
defendant challenges the court’s personal jurisdiction on the ground of
improper service of process ‘the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the
existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an
effective service.’ ” (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403,
413.) The
filing
of a proof of service in compliance with statutory requirements
creates a
rebuttable presumption that
the service was proper and shifts the burden of proof. (Dill v. Berquist
Construction Co., (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1439–1440.) If the
plaintiff meets this initial burden, “it becomes the defendant’s burden to
demonstrate that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable.” (Buchanan
v. Soto (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 1353, 1362.)
Moreover, effective service should be
liberally construed if actual notice has been received by the defendant. The
question of service should be resolved by considering, from a practical
standpoint. This approach is anticipated to eliminate unnecessary,
time-consuming, and costly disputes over legal technicalities, without
prejudicing the right of defendants to proper notice of court proceedings. (Pasadena
Medi-Center Associates v. Superior Court (1973) 9 Cal.3d 773, 778.)
Analysis
The present motion is not moot as
Defendant has not filed an answer or any other filing accepting service. It
remains possible that Defendant might file another motion to quash Plaintiff’s
third service attempt.
1.  First Service Attempt
The burden rests with Plaintiff to
create a rebuttable presumption of effective service through a proof of service
that complies with statutory requirements. Plaintiff did not file a proof of
service his August 23, 2023, service attempt and therefore failed to meet this
initial burden. Consequently, Defendant's motion to quash Plaintiff's August
23, 2023, service is GRANTED.
2.  Second Service Attempt
On October 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
proof of service for its September 28, 2023, attempt, wherein Plaintiff
allegedly served copies of the summons, complaint, and other court filings on
an individual named Preet Desai, at 2:10 PM at 3705 El Moreno St., La
Crescenta, CA 91214. Plaintiff filed a proof of service that met the statutory
requirement and therefore has met his initial burden. 
Defendant presented a declaration from
Ritesh Desai, agent for service of process for Lankershim, stating that Preet
Desai is not a manager of the company, is not listed as an agent for service on
the Secretary of State website, and did not receive a copy of the summons and
complaint via mail for this action.  The
failure to mail the summons and complain after substituted service is determinative
as to that effort, and the Court grants that motion.
