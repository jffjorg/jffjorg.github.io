And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Matias Salinas Ortiz vs Robert Anthony Avelar Jr., case number 21STCV09214. The case involves a motion for relief from waiver of jury trial. The Plaintiff, Matias Salinas Ortiz, filed the complaint on March 9, 2021, and failed to pay jury fees on time. The Defendant, Robert Anthony Avelar Jr., posted jury fees on February 16, 2023. The Parties entered into a stipulation to continue a jury trial, but on February 28, 2024, the Plaintiff's counsel discovered that a non-jury trial was set for May 20, 2024. The Plaintiff now moves the Court for relief from waiver of jury trial.

The Judge finds good cause for relief from waiver and grants the motion. The sequence of events demonstrates that the Parties were litigating under the assumption that a jury trial would occur, and no opposition was filed claiming prejudice. The Judge concludes that no prejudice would likely result from the relief and imposing a trial waiver based on these facts is overly punitive.
