Legal Standard
 
The court may,
upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems
proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 436(a).) The court may also strike all or any part of any
pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court
rule, or an order of the court. (Id., § 436(b).) The grounds for a
motion to strike are that the pleading has irrelevant, false or improper
matter, or has not been drawn or filed in conformity with laws. (Id. §
436.) The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading
or by way of judicial notice. (Id. § 437.)
 
Punitive damages
may be imposed where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the
defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. (Civ. Code § 3294,
subd. (a).)¿ “Malice’ means conduct which is
intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable
conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious
disregard of the rights or safety of others.” (Civil Code section 3294 (c)(1).)
Under the statute, malice does not require actual intent to harm. Conscious
disregard for the safety of another may be sufficient where the defendant is
aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his or her conduct and
willfully fails to avoid such consequences. (Pfeifer v.John Crane, Inc.
(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1299.) ‘Despicable’ is a powerful term that refers
to circumstances that are ‘base,’ ‘vile,’ or ‘contemptible.’ (College
Hospital, Inc. v. Superior Court (1994) 8 Cal.4th 704, 725.)
 
A plaintiff must
assert facts with specificity to support a conclusion that a defendant acted
with oppression, fraud, or malice.¿ To wit, there is
a heightened pleading requirement regarding a claim for punitive damages.¿ (Smith v.
Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1041-1042.)¿ “When
nondeliberate injury is charged, allegations that the defendant’s conduct was
wrongful, willful, wanton, reckless or unlawful do not support a claim for
exemplary damages; such allegations do not charge malice. (G. D. Searle
& Co. v. Superior Court (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 22, 29.)
 
CCP section 425.10 provides that
“where an action is brought to recover actual or punitive damages for personal
injury or wrongful death, the amount demanded shall not be stated.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 425.10(b).)
 
Background and
Analysis
 
On November 29,
2023, Plaintiff filed the present auto accident case against Defendant Javier
Giron. Defendant now moves to the Court to strike the following portions of the
Complaint:
·        
Plaintiff's prayer for punitive
damages on page 3 of the Complaint. 
·        
Plaintiff's prayer for damages in the
amount of $814,488.06 on page 3 of the Complaint.
 
From December 29,
2023, to January 5, 2024, the Parties met and conferred, during which Plaintiff
initially agreed to file an amended Complaint without a claim for punitive
damages by January 8, 2024, but he failed to do so. Defendant has met the
meet-and-confer requirement before filing the present motion.
 
Plaintiff must
plead facts with specificity showing that Defendant acted with malice to
substantiate a prayer for punitive damages, but Plaintiff filed a form
complaint with no factual allegations. Additionally, the amount of damages for
personal injury cannot not be stated on the complaint under CCP § 425.10(b). Plaintiff did not file an opposition. Thus, Defendant’s motion to
strike Plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages and damages in the amount of
$814,488.06 on page 3 of the is GRANTED with leave to amend.
 
If Plaintiff
decides to amend the Complaint with facts substantiating a claim for punitive
damages, he needs to plead specific facts with a clear and convincing showing
of malice.
