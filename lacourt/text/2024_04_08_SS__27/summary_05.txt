And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint and to reopen discovery. The Plaintiff, ADA TRAN, seeks to add Christopher Decampli as a defendant and an alter ego to MVM Grading and Demolition Inc, citing evidence that Decampli is the alter ego of MVM. The Defendant, MVM Grading and Demolition Inc, opposes the motion, claiming prejudice and arguing that there is insufficient evidence to substantiate the claim. The Judge finds that the request to amend the complaint does not stem from the discovery of new facts substantiating alter ego liability, but rather from the hope that Preferred Contractors Insurance Company would extend coverage on the basis of alter ego liability. The Judge also finds that the motion is premature and would result in delayed trial preparation, shift in legal strategies, and increased litigation cost, all of which would be prejudicial to the Plaintiff.
