And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling grants the Defendant's motion to quash the Plaintiff's two previous attempts at serving Lankershim Apts. The first attempt did not include a proof of service, and the second attempt's proof of service did not establish that the person served was authorized to receive service. The Court finds that the Plaintiff failed to meet its burden of proving effective service in the first attempt and that the second attempt was improperly served. The motion to quash is granted for both attempts.
