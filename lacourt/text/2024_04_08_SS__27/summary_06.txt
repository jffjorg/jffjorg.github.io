And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants the motion filed by Hesam Yazdanpanah, counsel for Vince Latkins and Bethtenia Latkins, to be relieved as counsel due to an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client communication. The motion was unopposed and the necessary forms were properly served. The Court notes that the next hearing is an FSC set for August 22, 2024, which should be sufficient time for the Plaintiffs to retain new counsel. Alternatively, if necessary, Plaintiffs or new counsel can request a continuance of the trial. The Court holds that a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship or communication is a valid ground for allowing the attorney to withdraw.
