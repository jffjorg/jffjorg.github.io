And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for sanctions filed by the Plaintiff against the Defendant's counsel, John Barber. The Plaintiff argues that Barber's motion for leave to conduct a second PMK deposition was frivolous and not made in good faith. The Judge disagrees, finding that Barber acted in good faith and that there is a legal basis for the Defendant to request the subsequent deposition. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence to substantiate their claim that Barber was aware of the documents' existence and deliberately withheld them prior to the deposition. Therefore, the Judge denies the motion for sanctions.
