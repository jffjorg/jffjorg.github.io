And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to deem the requests for admissions, set one, admitted. The plaintiff failed to serve timely discovery responses and did not file an opposition to the motion. The judge finds that the plaintiff waived any objections to the requests for admissions and therefore, the truth of any matters specified in the requests will be deemed admitted. The judge notes that this is different from a motion to compel further discovery responses, which has meet and confer requirements. The parties are advised to submit to this tentative ruling by email or appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
