And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court denies the motion to quash filed by Wayne Himselsein, a third party, to block a notice of judgment debtor examination served on him by National Pacific Corporation, the judgment creditor. The court finds that National Pacific is entitled to conduct a judgment debtor examination on Innovation Advisory Group, Inc., which is owned and/or controlled by Himselsein, as it has a judgment against Innovation Advisory. The court also finds that National Pacific properly served Innovation Advisory by serving Himselsein, who refused to accept the notice of judgment debtor examination.
