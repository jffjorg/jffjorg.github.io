And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the complaint filed by Plaintiff Federico Carlo against the County of Los Angeles. The demurrer was filed by the County to dismiss the complaint, and the judge has ruled on each of the eight causes of action brought by Plaintiff.

The judge has overruled the demurrer to the first cause of action, which alleges retaliation under Labor Code section 1102.5, and to the eighth cause of action, which alleges retaliation under Labor Code section 6310. The judge has sustained the demurrer to the remaining causes of action, which allege discrimination, harassment, and retaliation under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The judge has granted Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to address the deficiencies identified in the demurrer, and has ordered Plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 10 days.
