CASE:                         Employers Compensation Ins. Co. v
BaronHR, LLC
 
CASE NO.:                 23STCV11980            
 
MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL

 
MOVING PARTY:               Antonio Ramos, Counsel for Defendant BaronHR, LLC
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): No response on
eCourt as of 4/16/24
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for equitable indemnity that was filed on May 26, 2023.
Plaintiff alleges that that Defendant failed to maintain insurance for Workers’
Compensation, causing Plaintiff to bear the liability to an employee on a
successful workers’ compensation claim. 
 
Attorney Antonio Ramos moves to be
relieved as counsel for Defendant BaronHR, LLC. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Antonio Ramos moves to be
relieved as counsel for Defendant BaronHR, LLC. 
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1005(b), notice of a motion must be given at least 16 court days before
the date the motion is to be heard. The time for notice is extended by two
court days if notice is served electronically, and by five calendar days if
served by mail. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1010.6; 1013.) This motion was served by
mail and electronic service, and notice was therefore due by March 25, 2024,
for electronic service and March 22, 2024 for mail service. Notice of this
motion was given on March 27, 2024. This motion was not timely served. 
 
Moreover,
although Moving Counsel filed a notice of motion and motion on form MC-051 and
a Declaration in Support of the Motion on form MC-052, Moving Counsel did not
file a proposed order on form MC-053 as required by California Rules of Court
rule 3.1362(d).
 
As the motion is procedurally
defective in multiple respects, the Court cannot grant Moving Counsel the
relief sought. 
 
Accordingly, Attorney Ramos’s Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel for Defendant is DENIED. This ruling is without prejudice
to a procedurally proper motion containing all required filings. 
 
This ruling is conditioned on Moving Counsel giving notice to
all parties of the Court’s ruling. 
 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
