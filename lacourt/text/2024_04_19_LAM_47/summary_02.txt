And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion by Attorney Antonio Ramos to be relieved as counsel for Defendant BaronHR, LLC. The judge found that the motion was not timely served, as it was served by mail and electronic service on March 27, 2024, instead of the required deadline of March 22, 2024. Additionally, the motion did not include a proposed order as required by California Rules of Court rule 3.1362(d). Therefore, the court cannot grant the relief sought, and the motion is denied. The judge notes that this ruling is without prejudice to a procedurally proper motion containing all required filings.
