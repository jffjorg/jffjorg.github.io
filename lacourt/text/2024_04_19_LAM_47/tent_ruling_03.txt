CASE:                         Jenna Lawrence v. Eureka Restaurant
Group, LLC
 
CASE NO.:                 23STCV20283            
 
MOTION
TO SET ASIDE STIPULATION TO ARBITRATE

 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff Jenna Lawrence
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): Defendant Eureka
Restaurant Group, LLC
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a sexual harassment and employment discrimination action that was
filed on August 23, 2023. Plaintiff alleges that she was sexually harassed by a
colleague and terminated in retaliation for her complaints and for requiring
accommodations for a disability. 
 
Plaintiff moves to set aside a
stipulation to arbitrate filed on December 12, 2023. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside
Stipulation to Arbitrate is GRANTED. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
            Plaintiff
moves to set aside a stipulation to arbitrate filed on December 12, 2023.
Plaintiff does not identify the authority for her motion in the Notice of
Motion. The body of Plaintiff’s moving papers discuss the Court’s inherent
authority to reconsider its own motions, but this power does not entitle a
party to bring a motion for relief. (See Darling, Hall & Rae v. Kritt
(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 1148, 1156.) However, under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473(b):
 
The court may, upon
any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative
from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application
for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading
proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted,
and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months,
after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 473(b).) There is an extensive body of caselaw broadly construing the term
“proceeding” within the meaning of this statute to include “any step taken by a party in the progress
of a civil action.” (Zellerino v.
Brown (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d
1097, 1105 [quoting Stonesifer v. Kilburn (1892) 94 Cal. 33, 43]; see
also Burns v. Superior
Court (1903) 140 Cal. 1,
5-6; Gipe v. Superior Court (1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 617, 626; Marblehead
L. Co. v. Superior Court (1923) 60 Cal.App. 644, 655-56.) 
 
            Moreover,
there is express authority standing for the position that the Court may set
aside a stipulation to arbitrate signed by an attorney when the client did not
consent to that stipulation. (Blanton v. Womancare, Inc. (1985) 38
Cal.3d 396, 407-408; Sanker v. Brown (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 1144, 1147.) 
 
            Here,
Plaintiff’s counsel states categorically that she signed the stipulation to
arbitrate on December 6, 2023, without first obtaining the consent of her
client. (Declaration of Ann Guleser ISO Mot. ¶ 3.) Attorney Guleser further
states that Plaintiff did not consent to the stipulation and that Plaintiff’s
consent was never even sought. (Id. ¶ 5.) Plaintiff thus argues that,
under existing precedent, she should be relieved from the obligation to
arbitrate her claims. 
 
            Defendant,
in opposition, argues that Plaintiff should be held to the stipulation because
she should be accountable for the failure of counsel to obtain her consent to
an agreement. Defendant cites absolutely no authority for this position, which
is unsurprising since our Supreme Court categorically rejected that position in
1985. Further, although Defendant casts aspersions on the conduct of
Plaintiff’s counsel, Defendant offers no evidence demonstrating that Plaintiff
ratified her counsel’s actions or otherwise consented to arbitration beyond what
may be inferred solely from the acts of counsel.  
 
            In light of
the express authority cited by Plaintiff and the express statements by
Plaintiff’s counsel that she acted without authority from her client, the Court
finds good cause to set aside its December 12, 2023, order and permit the case
to go forward on the merits. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Set Aside Stipulation to Arbitrate is GRANTED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
//
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
