STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a wrongful termination and employment discrimination action.
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants refused to accommodate Plaintiff for a
work-related injury and terminated her for pursuing accommodations. 
 
Defendant Concord Farms, Inc. moves
to set aside the default entered against it under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473.5.
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Concord Farms, Inc.’s
Motion to Set Aside Default is DENIED. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Defendant Concord Farms, Inc. moves
to set aside the default entered against it under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473.5.
 
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
473.5 provides that, “[w]hen service of a summons has not resulted in actual
notice to a party in time to defend the action and a default . . . has been
entered against him or her in the action, he or she may serve and file a notice
of motion to set aside the default . . . and for leave to defend the action.”
The notice must be served and filed “within a reasonable time, but in no event
exceeding earlier of: (i) two years after entry of a default judgment
against him or her; or (ii) 180 days after service on him or her of a written
notice that the default or default judgment has been entered.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 473.5(a).) Upon a finding by the Court that “the motion was made
within the period permitted by subdivision (a) and that his or her lack of
actual notice in time to defend the action was not caused by his or her
avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect, it may set aside the default . . .
on whatever terms as may be just and allow the party to defend the action.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 473.5(c).) “Actual notice” under this statute means “genuine
knowledge of the party litigant,” and not “constructive notice” or “imputed
notice.” (Rosenthal v. Garner (1983), 142 Cal. App. 3d 891, 895.) 
 
Notice of Motion
 
            Defendant
served its motion via electronic service on March 26, 2024. Pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 1005(b), notice of a motion must be given a minimum of
sixteen court days before the date of hearing, plus two court days for
electronic service. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1005(b); 1010.6.) Thus, for a hearing
date of April 19, 2024, the deadline to serve and file this motion was March
25, 2024. As Plaintiff has not objected to the motion on this basis, however, the
Court will consider Defendant’s arguments on their merits. 
 
Timeliness
 
            Defendant
was defaulted on September 25, 2023. (September 26, 2023 Minute Order.) As of this
date, no default judgment has been entered. Thus, there is no dispute that this
motion is timely. 
 
Actual Notice
 
            Defendant
requests that the Court set aside the default entered against it on September
25, 2023, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5 and the Court’s
inherent authority on the ground that it never received notice of this action. 
 
            Defendant
contends that it never received actual notice of the action because it was
never served with the Summons and First Amended Complaint and had no notice of
this action, according to Defendant’s agent for service of process, Grace Tung.
(Declaration of Grace Tung ISO Mot. ¶¶ 2-3.) The record tells a different
story. Plaintiff filed her complaint on May 15, 2020. (See Complaint.) According
to the Proof of Service filed on July 7, 2020, Plaintiff Served Ms. Tung on
June 16, 2020, by substitute service at 4005 Whipple Road, Union City, CA,
94587 by leaving the papers in the presence of Abbey Chan and thereafter
mailing the papers to the same address. (July 7, 2020 Proof of Service.) This
service was apparently successful, as Defendant answered the Complaint on July
15, 2020. (See Answer.) On June 18, 2021, Anahita Kouroshnia—who brought this
motion on Defendant’s behalf—successfully moved to be relieved as counsel for
Defendant. (June 18, 2021 Minute Order.) Defendant failed to retain substitute
counsel, and Defendant’s answer was stricken in August of 2021 for that failure.
(August 10, 2021 Minute Order.) Plaintiff amended her Complaint on August 16,
2022. (First Amended Complaint.) The First Amended Complaint was served on
Defendant in the same manner as the original on September 12, 2022, according
to the Proof of Service filed on October 12, 2022, by serving the First Amended
Complaint at the same address by leaving it with the same individual and
mailing a copy to that address. (October 12, 2022 Proof of Service.) 
 
            Defendant
offers absolutely no explanation for why a mode of service that sufficed to
allow Defendant to answer the original Complaint somehow failed to do the same
for the First Amended Complaint. Ms. Tung’s conclusory statement that she was
unaware of the action is not credible, especially since her service in 2020
resulted in Defendant’s appearance in this case soon there after. The Court is
not persuaded that relief should be granted on this record. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendant Concord Farms, Inc.’s Motion to Set Aside Default is DENIED. 
 
            Plaintiff
to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
