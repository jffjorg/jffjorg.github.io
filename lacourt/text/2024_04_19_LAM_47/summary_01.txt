Here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court's tentative ruling is that the Defendant's Motion to Set Aside Default is DENIED. The Defendant claims that it never received actual notice of the action, but the Court finds that the Defendant has failed to provide a credible explanation for why a mode of service that sufficed to allow the Defendant to answer the original Complaint somehow failed to do the same for the First Amended Complaint. The Court is not persuaded that relief should be granted on this record.
