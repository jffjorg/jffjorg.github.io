**Case Summary**

The plaintiff, Jenna Lawrence, is suing Eureka Restaurant Group, LLC for sexual harassment and employment discrimination. The plaintiff's counsel signed a stipulation to arbitrate on December 6, 2023, without obtaining the client's consent. The plaintiff now moves to set aside the stipulation, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) and relevant case law. The court grants the motion, finding good cause to set aside the stipulation and permit the case to go forward on the merits. The court finds that the plaintiff's counsel acted without authority from the client and that the defendant failed to provide any authority supporting their opposition to the motion.
