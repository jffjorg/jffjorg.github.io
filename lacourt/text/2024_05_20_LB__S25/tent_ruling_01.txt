  Case Number:  24LBCV00239    Hearing Date:   May 20, 2024    Dept:  S25 BackgroundOn or about October 5, 2023, Plaintiff Albert Simic (“Plaintiff”) responded to a rental advertisement on Zillow.com for an apartment located on 1337 South Gaffey Street #8, San Pedro, CA 90731. (FAC ¶ 17.) Defendant Roseann Rosman (“Defendant”) was the owner and property manager for the apartment. (FAC ¶ 18.) On October 6, 20023, Defendant responded to Plaintiff’s inquiry and informed Plaintiff of her no pets and no smoking policy. (FAC ¶ 19.) The following day, Plaintiff view the apartment alone. Subsequently, during a phone call, Plaintiff allegedly informed Defendant of his emotional support animal. (FAC ¶ 20.)On October 9, 2023, Defendant emailed the rental application to Plaintiff. In the email, Defendant stated “Please know I do NOT accept pets or other occupants other than you….” FAC ¶ 21.) That same day, Plaintiff submitted a rental application and indicated to Defendant his difficulties in obtaining an extended credit report as required by Defendant. These difficulties were communicated to Defendant and Plaintiff offered to reimburse Defendant of any costs associated with obtaining an extended credit report. Defendant insisted on an extended credit report to allegedly obtain criminal background check onPlaintiff; Plaintiff ultimately obtained the extended credit report and provided the document to Defendant. Defendant acknowledged receipt of the extended report. (FAC ¶ 22-26.)In the evening of October 9, Defendant informed Plaintiff that a relative needed the apartment and asked Plaintiff to “wait.” The next day, using a “disguised” email address, Plaintiff contacted Defendant to ask if the apartment was available; Defendant responded that the apartment was available. Further, on or about November 5, Plaintiff received a Zillow notification that the apartment remained available, and the rental amount was reduced. (FAC ¶¶ 27-28.) Consequently, Plaintiff claims Defendant would not rent the apartment to him because of Plaintiff’s emotional support animal. In late November, Plaintiff informed Defendant of the “perceived discrimination” to which Defendant responded she “did not owe him any explanations” and was allegedly advised against creating unnecessary stress. (FAC ¶ 30.)Plaintiff sued alleging the following causes of action in his First Amended Complaint (“FAC”):1. Violation of Cal. Code. Regs. Title 2 § 121762. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress3. Violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act4. Disability Discrimination – Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodation5. Disability Discrimination – Failure to Engage in the Interactive ProcessDefendant demurs to the first, second, third, fourth and fifth causes of action, on the grounds that each claim fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.Defendant requests the court strike the following portions from Plaintiff’s FAC:1.

Page 12, Prayer for Relief ¶ 2, line 59. Page 12, Prayer for Relief ¶ 3, line 610. Page 12, Prayer for Relief ¶ 5, line 8Request for Judicial NoticeDefendant requests judicial notice of an unpublished federal case, Rodriquez v. Morgan (C.D. Cal. Jan. 26, 2012, No. CV 09-8939-GW U.S. District LEXIS 9643). The Court takes judicial notice of the case; however, as the case is unpublished the Court considers it for persuasive value only.Legal StandardsA party may demur to a complaint on the grounds that it “does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) A demurrer tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts accept all well pleaded facts as true. (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1078.) “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.” (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.)Although courts construe pleadings liberally, sufficient facts must be alleged to support the allegations pled to survive a demurrer. (Rakestraw v. California Physicians' Serv. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on the party who filed the pleading subject to demurrer to show the court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)First Cause of Action - Violation of Cal. Code. Regs. Title 2 § 12176An individual with a disability seeking reasonable accommodation or modification must make a request for such accommodation or modification. (See CCR 2 § 12176, subd. (f)(1)). “A request for a reasonable accommodation or modification need not be made in a particular manner or at a particular time. An individual makes a reasonable accommodation or modification request at the time they request orally or in writing… because of a disability, regardless of whether the phrase “reasonable accommodation” or “reasonable modification” is used as part of the request. A request for a reasonable accommodation or reasonable modification may be made at any time, including during the inquiry or application process….” (CCR 2, § 12176 subd.(f)(1)(3).Taking the allegations as true, the Court finds there are sufficient facts pled to state a cause of action for Violation of Cal. Code. Regs. Title 2 § 12176. Plaintiff’s alleged comment to Defendant indicating he has an ESA should have placed Defendant on notice of a potential request for an accommodation/exception to the “no pet policy.” Further, although Plaintiff has not alleged his application was “denied,” Defendant’s alleged response when confronted by Plaintiff regarding the status of his application and the continued availability/advertising of the apartment (e.g. the alleged comment “she did not owe any explanation and advised against creating unnecessary stress”) could be interpreted as a denial of Plaintiff’s application and, thus, are sufficient to overcome a demurrer. FAC ¶¶ 20 and 30.Second Cause of Action - Intentional Infliction of Emotional DistressIIED occurs under conditions where there is: (1) extreme and outrageous conduct by the defendant with the intention of causing, or reckless disregard of the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff’s suffering severe or extreme emotional distress; and (3) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress by the defendant's outrageous conduct. (Hughes v. Pair (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1035, 1050.) A defendant's conduct is “outrageous” when it is so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized community. And the defendant's conduct must be intended to inflict injury or engaged in with the realization that injury will result. (Ibid.)As alleged, Defendant’s conduct does not rise to the level of “extreme and outrageous” conduct that exceeds all bounds tolerated in a civilized society. Further, there are no allegations that Defendant acted with reckless disregard for Plaintiff’s well-being or that Defendant’s actions intended to inflict injury on Plaintiff. Defendant’s demurrer to the Second Cause of Action is sustained with leave to amend.Third Cause of Action - Violation of the Unruh Civil Rights ActThe Unruh Act provides in part: “All persons within the jurisdiction of this State are free and equal, and no matter what their race, color, religion, ancestry, or national origin are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.” (Civ. Code, § 51.) The Legislature used the words “all” and “of every kind whatsoever” in referring to business establishments covered by the Unruh Act (Civ. Code, § 51), and the inclusion of these words, without any exception and without specification of particular kinds of enterprises, leaves no doubt that the term “business establishments” was used in the broadest sense reasonably possible. The word “business” embraces everything about which one can be employed, and it is often synonymous with “calling, occupation, or trade, engaged in for the purpose of making a livelihood or gain.” (See Mansfield v. Hyde, 112 Cal.App.2d 133, 137. Burks v. Poppy Const. Co., 57 Cal. 2d 463, 468, 370 P.2d 313 (1962). The Unruh Civil Rights Act applies to businesses engaged in the selling or leasing of residential housing, including owners, property managers, developers, and real estate brokers. (CCR 2 § 12005, subd. (f); see Marina Point, Ltd. v. Wolfson (1982) 30 Cal. 3d 721, 730-731; O'Connor v. Village Green Owners Association (1983) 33 Cal.3d 790, 794-795.)Although Defendant is an individual, she is engaged in the “occupation” or “business” of leasing residential housing. The Court, thus, overrules Defendant’s demurrer to the Third Cause of Action.Fourth Cause of Action: Disability Discrimination – Failure to Provide Reasonable Accommodation AND Fifth Case of Action: Disability Discrimination – Failure to Engage in the Interactive ProcessThe individual with a disability seeking a reasonable accommodation or modification must make a request for such accommodation or modification. (See CCR 2 § 12176, subd. (f)(1)). “Discrimination includes . . . refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services when these accommodations may be necessary to afford a disabled person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.” (Gov. Code, § 12927, subd. (c)(1).) In order to establish discrimination based on a refusal to provide reasonable accommodations, a party must establish that he or she (1) suffers from a disability as defined in FEHA, (2) the discriminating party knew of, or should have known of, the disability, (3) accommodation is necessary to afford an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling, and (4) the discriminating party refused to make this accommodation. Auburn Woods I Homeowners Assn. v. Fair Emp. & Hous. Com., 121 Cal. App. 4th 1578, 1592.Here, taking the allegation as true, Plaintiff has pled sufficient facts to support (1) he suffers from a disability as defined in FEHA, (2) Defendant knew of, or should have known of, the disability, (3) accommodation allowing an ESA is necessary to afford an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling, and (4) Defendant, when allegedly stating “she did not owe any explanation and advised against creating unnecessary stress,” failed and/or refused to make the accommodation. Plaintiff need not exhaust administrative remedies under FEHA as suggested by Defendant. Accordingly, the demurrer to the Fourth and Fifth cause of action is overruled.Motion to StrikeDefendant requests the court strike the following portions from Plaintiff’s FAC:1.
