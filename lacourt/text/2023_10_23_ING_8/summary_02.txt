And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to continue the trial date. The plaintiffs sought a 3.5 month continuance to allow for discovery and preparation, citing that the defendants have not conducted any discovery and that the related case needs to be tried concurrently. The judge considered the factors for granting a continuance, including the proximity of the trial date, whether all parties have stipulated to a continuance, and the availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion. The judge notes that a continuance is in the best interests of the case, but also notes that it is unlikely the case will be ready for trial in February 2024 if discovery motions remain looming. The judge orders oral argument on the proposed discovery schedule and sets the trial date to be continued once it is determined.
