Summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer (a request to dismiss the lawsuit) filed by Topa Insurance is sustained, meaning that the lawsuit is dismissed without allowing the plaintiff, Zuolin Cao, to amend the complaint. The judge finds that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action and that the policy issued by Topa Insurance did not include liability coverage, which is a key issue in the lawsuit. The judge also notes that plaintiff has failed to plead facts showing how Topa Insurance breached the insurance policy and that there is no fiduciary relationship between the parties. The ruling is based on the judge's review of the evidence and the arguments presented by the parties.
