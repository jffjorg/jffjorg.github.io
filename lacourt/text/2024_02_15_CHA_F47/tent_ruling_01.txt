SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Maria Margarita
Carranza’s (Plaintiff) care and treatment at Defendant KF Rinaldi, LLC dba Rinaldi
Convalescent Hospital (Defendant) from 4/10/21 to 4/12/21.  Plaintiff alleges that she suffered “[s]evere
infliction of injuries sustained by employees from Rinaldi Convalescent
Hospital” by refusing to give her prescription drugs, including medication for
pain and anxiety.  Plaintiff also alleges
that Defendant’s employees and staff were ordered to “not speak or assist Plaintiff
with any requests,” that staff refused to take her blood pressure, and that her
“complaint issued focus[es] around the infliction of injuries.”  Further, Plaintiff alleges that she was “[d]efrauded
by the Brochures shown to plaintiff,” that she was not allowed hygiene after she
“soiled [her] legs unable to reach [the] toilet (in use by another Patient),”
that Defendant’s employees stole her prescribed opioids, and that she was
kidnapped and held against her will “during [a] 48-hour mandatory stay” at Defendant.  
 
On 2/25/22, representing herself, Plaintiff filed a
complaint against Defendant.  On 3/18/22,
 Plaintiff filed the operative (First) Amended
Complaint (FAC) which does not assert any distinct causes of action.  On 12/14/22, default was entered against
Defendant.  (See 12/14/22 Request
for Entry of Default).  On 5/9/23,
Defendant filed a demurrer and a motion to strike as to the First Amended
Complaint which were set for hearing on 6/9/23 in Department 30 of the Spring
Street Courthouse.  On 6/2/23, this case
was transferred from Department 30 to Department F47 of the Chatsworth
Courthouse.  (See 6/2/23 Minute
Order).  On 7/6/23, Defendant re-filed
the  demurrer and motion to strike which
was scheduled for hearing on 10/18/23 in Department F47.  On 7/31/23, Plaintiff filed an opposition to
the demurrer.  On 10/11/23, Defendant
filed a reply to the opposition.  On
10/17/23 Plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion to strike.
 
On 10/18/23, the Court placed the hearing on the demurrer
and motion to strike off calendar due to Defendant’s default status.  (See 10/18/23 Minute Order).  On 12/22/23, Defendant filed and served the
instant motion seeking an order vacating and setting aside the default entered
against Defendant KF Rinaldi, LLC dba Rinaldi Convalescent Hospital on 12/14/22
and allowing Defendant to file a responsive pleading in this matter.  On 1/22/24, Plaintiff filed an opposition to
the motion.  On 2/7/24, Defendant filed a
reply to the opposition.     
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendant’s Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) is
granted.  
 
CCP 473.5 provides: 
 
“(a) When service of a summons has
not resulted in actual notice to a party in time to defend the action and a
default or default judgment has been entered against him or her in the action,
he or she may serve and file a
notice of motion to set aside the default
or default judgment and for leave to defend the action. The notice of motion shall be served and
filed within a reasonable time, but in no event exceeding the earlier of: (i)
two years after entry of a default judgment against him or her; or (ii) 180 days after service on
him or her of a written notice
that the default or default
judgment has been entered.
(b) A notice of motion to set aside
a default or default judgment and for leave to defend the action shall
designate as the time for making the motion a date prescribed
by subdivision
(b) of Section 1005, and it shall be accompanied by an
affidavit showing under oath that the party's
lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was not caused by his or her avoidance of service or inexcusable
neglect. The party shall serve and file with the notice
a copy of the answer, motion, or other pleading proposed to be filed in the
action.
(c) Upon a finding by the court
that the motion was made within the period permitted by subdivision (a) and
that his or her lack of actual
notice in time to defend the action was not caused by his or her avoidance of
service or inexcusable neglect, it may set aside the default or default
judgment on whatever terms as
may be just and allow the party
to defend the action.”
 
Actual notice is strictly construed such that relief from
default is liberally granted so that cases may be resolved on their
merits.  See Olvera (1991)
232 CA3d 32, 39-40.
 
Here, Defendant’s designated agent for service of process
listed on the California Secretary of State website is Jacob Wintner, 6300
Wilshire Blvd., Ste. 1800, Los Angeles, CA 90048.  (RJN; Hassell Decl. ¶8, Ex.G).  Defendant’s designated agent for service of
process never received the Summons, notice of entry of default, or any other
filings in this case.  (Hassell Decl. ¶8,
Ex.B-E).    The proofs of service filed by Plaintiff
indicate service on a purported security guard and Candis/Candice Allen,
administrator.  Neither the security
guard nor Allen were the person designated as Defendant’s agent for service or
process; nor were they Defendant’s president, chief executive officer, head of
the corporation, vice president, secretary or assistant secretary, treasurer or
assistant treasurer, controller or chief financial officer, general manager, or
a person authorized by the corporation to receive service of process.  (Hassell Decl. ¶¶8-9, Ex.G); CCP 416.10.   Additionally,
Candis Allen has submitted a declaration wherein she attests that she was never
served with or received the Summons and Complaint, notice of entry of default,
or any other filings in this case.  (Allen Decl. ¶¶4-6).   
 
Defendant did not become aware of this action until
4/25/23, after default had already been entered.  (Hassell Decl. ¶¶5, 10,Ex.D; Allen Decl.
¶4).  Defendant did not have actual
notice of this action in time to defend. 
(Hassell Decl. ¶¶3-5, 8-11, Ex.B-D, G; Allen Decl. ¶4).  The Court finds that Defendant’s lack of
actual notice in time to defend was not caused by Defendant’s avoidance of
service or inexcusable neglect.  (Allen
Decl. ¶7; Hassell Decl. ¶11).
 
Plaintiff never properly served Defendant with notice of
the entry of default.  (Hassell Decl.
¶¶5-9, 12, Ex.D-G; Allen Decl. ¶5). 
Defendant was not aware that default had been entered until the Court’s
10/18/23 tentative ruling on Defendant’s demurrer and motion to strike.  (Hassell Decl. ¶¶7, 12, Ex.F; Allen Decl.
¶5).  As such, Defendant had 180 days
from 10/18/23 to file the instant motion. 
CCP 473.5(a).  Therefore, the
instant motion was timely filed and served on 12/22/23.  
 
CCP 473(d) provides: 
 
“The court may, upon motion of the
injured party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in its judgment or
orders as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order directed, and may,
on motion of either party after notice to the other party, set aside any void
judgment or order.”
 
A default entered against a defendant that was not served
with a summons in the manner prescribed by statute is void.  Dill (1994) 24 CA4th 1426, 1444; American
Express Centurion Bank (2011) 199 CA4th 383, 387; Ruttenberg (1997)
53 CA4th 804, 808.  A void judgment or
order may be set aside at any time.  Nagel
(1969) 273 CA2d 176, 179-180; Summers (2006) 140 CA4th 403, 415.  Here, the purported service of the summons
and complaint on a security guard and/or an administrator did not comply with
the statutory requirements for service on a corporation.  See CCP 416.10; CCP 415.20.
 
The Court finds that granting the instant motion will not
prejudice Plaintiff and is in the interests of justice as it will allow this
case to be resolved on its merits.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Defendant is ordered to reserve a hearing date for its demurrer and
motion to strike and re-file same.  The
newly filed papers should indicate the newly reserved hearing date.  If Plaintiff wishes to oppose the newly filed
demurrer and motion to strike, Plaintiff must file new opposition papers.  In other words, the Court will not consider
the papers previously filed in relation to the 10/18/23 hearing date for the
demurrer and motion to strike.
