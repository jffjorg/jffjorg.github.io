SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of Plaintiff Zuolin Cao’s
(Plaintiff) dissatisfaction with Defendant Topa Insurance’s (Defendant)
handling and denial of the claim for her defense in an underlying action.  
 
Since 2015, Plaintiff had an insurance policy issued by
Defendant for Plaintiff’s real property located at 10500 Alabama Ave. in
Chatsworth, California 91311 (the Property). 
(Complaint, Attachment Item 8 ¶1). 
On 6/26/18, a third-party’s mother’s body was found in the swimming pool
of Plaintiff’s property.  Id.  
 
The third-party sued Plaintiff for wrongful death
(Underlying Action).  The insurance
policy issued by Defendant to Plaintiff for the Property did not include
liability insurance.  Therefore,
Defendant declined to extend coverage for Plaintiff’s defense in the Underlying
Action.  (Id. at ¶¶1-2).  Plaintiff alleges that it was
Defendant’s  fault that she did not have
liability coverage for the Property.  Id.  Plaintiff did not retain counsel to represent
her in the Underlying Action.  (Id.
¶6).  Ultimately, the Underlying Action
was voluntarily dismissed.  
 
On 5/30/23, Plaintiff, representing herself, filed this
action against Defendant alleging claims for: (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Failed
Defense/Rejected to Defend Plaintiff; (3) Policy Did Not Comply With the Law;
(4) Failed to Comply With the Code of Insurance Procedure; 
(5) Fiduciary Duty and (6) Insurance Provided by
Defendant to Plaintiff Was Defective. 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the issues Defendant had
with the complaint, on 1/16/24, Defendant filed and served the instant demurrer
to the entire complaint on the grounds that it fails to state sufficient facts
to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain.  CCP 430.10(e), (f).  Plaintiff has opposed the demurrer and
Defendant has filed a reply to the opposition. 

 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendant’s Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) is
granted.  
 
Defendant’s objections (numbers 1-6) to evidence
submitted in support of opposition are sustained. 
 
Breach of Contract
 
The elements of a breach of contract cause of action are:
(1) the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
breach by defendant and (4) resulting damage to plaintiff.  Lortz (1969) 273 CA2d 286, 290.  When pleading a breach of written contract
claim, the terms of the contract must be set out verbatim in the complaint, the
contract must be pled according to legal effect or a copy of the contract must
be attached and incorporated by reference. 
Heritage Pacific Financial, LLC (2013) 215 CA4th 972, 993.  Plaintiff has done none of the foregoing in
the complaint.  Additionally, Plaintiff
has failed to plead facts showing how Defendant breached the insurance policy,
especially when the evidence provided with the opposition establishes that the
insurance policy issued by Defendant for the period of 8/14/17 to 8/14/18 did
not include liability coverage.  (See
Opposition, Ex.1).
 
“Failed Defense”/“Rejected to Defend Plaintiff”
 
It is not clear what claim Plaintiff is attempting to
assert in this cause of action. 
Therefore, it is uncertain, ambiguous and unintelligible.  To the extent the claim is another attempt to
plead a breach of the insurance contract, it is duplicative of the inadequate
breach of contract cause of action.  
 
“Policy Did Not Comply With the Law”
 
This cause of action also fails for uncertainty.  Plaintiff’s reference to Insurance Code
sections regarding fire and liability policies does not show that Plaintiff’s
policy should have included or was otherwise required to include liability
coverage.     
 
“Failed to Comply With the Code of Insurance
Procedure”
 
It is also unclear what cause of action Plaintiff is
attempting to assert.  As such, the cause
of action fails for uncertainty.  To the
extent that Plaintiff is attempting to state a claim under the unfair
competition law, the claim fails. 
Business and Professions Code 17200 borrows violations from other laws
and treats them as unlawful and/or unfair business practices which are
independently actionable under the unfair competition law.  Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. (1999)
20 C4th 163, 180, 186-187.  
 
Here, Plaintiff generally references the Insurance
Code.  However, policyholders are deemed
to have knowledge of their own policy terms, including insurance limits.  Insurance Code 335; Sarchett (1987) 43
C3d 1, 15.  Therefore, the fact that
Plaintiff may not have read or understood her insurance policy is
irrelevant.  Id.; Atlas
Assurance Co. (1983) 146 CA3d 135, 144; Ray (1999) 77 CA4th 1039, 1049.
 
As noted above, the evidence Plaintiff provided with her
opposition, shows that the policy issued by Defendant for 8/14/17 to 8/14/18
did not include liability coverage.  (See
Opposition, Ex.1).
 
“Fiduciary Duty”
 
In California, there is no fiduciary relationship between
an insurer and its insured.  Love
(1990) 221 CA3d 1136; Henry (1990) 217 CA3d 1405; Vu (2001) 26
C4th 1142, 1150-1151.  Defendant did not
owe Plaintiff a duty to advise of the availability of insurance beyond what was
requested.  See Shultz Steel
Co. (1986) 187 CA3d 513, 522; Ray (1999) 77 CA4th 1039, 1049.
 
“Insurance Provided by the Defendant to the Plaintiff
Was Defective”
 
This cause of action also fails for uncertainty.  Plaintiff has not pled how the policy was
defective.  To the extent Plaintiff
intended to assert a bad faith claim, the claim fails.  To state a claim for bad faith, a plaintiff
must allege facts showing: (1) the insurer withheld benefits due under the
policy and (2) the withholding of such benefits was unreasonable or without
proper cause.  Major (2009) 169
CA4th 1197, 1209.  There can be no claim
for bad faith without a breach of contract. 
Waller (1995) 11 C4th 1, 35. 
As noted above, Plaintiff has failed to establish that Defendant
breached the insurance contract.  
 
To the extent that Plaintiff is attempting to state a
claim for violation of Insurance Code 790.03, the claim fails as the statute
does not provide for a private cause of action. 
See Moradi-Shalal (1988) 46 C3d 287, 304; Rattan
(2000) 84 CA4th 715, 724; Zephyr Park (1989) 213 CA3d 833,  834-837.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is sustained.  Plaintiff’s own allegations, arguments and
evidence establish that there was no liability coverage under the applicable
policy for the claim made in the Underlying 
Action.  Additionally, Plaintiff
gives no indication that she can cure the defects in her complaint by
amendment.  Therefore, the demurrer is
sustained without leave to amend.
