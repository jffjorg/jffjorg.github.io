And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a petition filed by a minor, Jesus Hector Chinchillas Dominguez, Jr., to confirm a compromise with defendant Dylan Rutherford. The compromise was reached after the minor's father was killed in a motor vehicle accident caused by a drunk driver. The minor did not receive any treatment and has reportedly fully recovered.

The defendant has agreed to pay $30,000 in settlement, but there are issues with service and disposal of the settlement funds. The court has ordered that the costs of $15,563.33 be deducted from the settlement amount, and no attorney fees will be deducted. The minor is to be paid $14,436.67.

The court has continued the hearing to February 15, 2024, pending resolution of the issues with service and disposal of the settlement funds. The court has also ordered that a guardian of the estate of the minor be appointed in probate court before proceeding with the petition.

The court has stated that it will deny the petition if the issues are not resolved, and that the matter will be continued if counsel represents that steps are being taken to address the issues.
