```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to set aside default and allow it to file a responsive pleading. The defendant, KF Rinaldi, LLC dba Rinaldi Convalescent Hospital, alleges that it did not receive actual notice of the action and therefore did not have a chance to defend itself. The judge finds that the defendant's lack of actual notice was not caused by its own negligence or avoidance of service. The judge also finds that the default entered against the defendant was void because it was not served in the manner prescribed by statute. The judge concludes that granting the motion will not prejudice the plaintiff and is in the interests of justice, as it will allow the case to be resolved on its merits.
