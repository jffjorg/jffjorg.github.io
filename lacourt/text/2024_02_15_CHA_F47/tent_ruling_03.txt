MINOR’S
COMPROMISE
 
Petition filed on 7/27/23.
 
MINOR: Jesus Hector Chinchillas Dominguez, Jr.
GAL: Dinorah Chinchillas (aunt)
DEFENDANT: Dylan Rutherford
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION: Minor’s father was killed in a motor vehicle accident caused by a drunk driver.  Minor did not receive any treatment and the
petition indicates that he has completely recovered.  

 
SETTLEMENT: $30,000 to be paid by Defendant Dylan
Rutherford.
 
ATTORNEY FEES: $0
 
COSTS: $15,563.33
 
AMOUNT TO BE PAID TO MINOR: $14,436.67
 
RULING:   
 
This action arises out of the death of the minor’s father
in a motor vehicle accident caused by a drunk driver.  Minor did not receive any treatment and the
petition indicates that he has completely recovered.
 
Defendant Dylan Rutherford has agreed to pay $30,000 in
settlement.  Costs of $15,563.33 will be
deducted from the settlement amount.  No
attorney fees will be deducted.  The
minor is to be paid $14,436.67.  
 
On 8/15/23, the hearing on the petition to confirm
minor’s compromise was continued to 2/15/24 due to issues with service and how
the remaining settlement funds are to be disposed.  
 
Specifically, the Court stated: 
 
“The petition was filed on 7/27/23,
only 12 court days before the 8/14/23 hearing date.  The 
proof of service attached to the petition indicates that the petition
was only electronically served on attorney Edward E. Ward, Jr., counsel for
Defendants Dylan Rutherford, Logan MacPherson and Alisha MacPherson.  However, no email address for attorney Ward
appears in eCourt.  Additionally, it is
not clear why the petition was not served on the State of California Victim
Compensation Board who has appeared in the action.    
 
Additionally, the following issue
need[s] to be addressed:  
 
How the remaining settlement funds
are to be disposed is unclear.  No.18.b(1)
indicates that there is not a guardianship of the estate of the minor and
requests the appointment of one so that the settlement funds may be delivered
to the person appointed.  (See also
proposed Order, No.8.b(2)).  No.20 “Additional
orders” in the petition states: 
 
‘As an alternative to giving the
money to the guardian ad litem, Petitioner requests that the court orders the
money to be deposited in a trust account in the state of Arizona instead of the
state of California since the petitioner and the claimant live in Mexico and it
would be much more costly and time-consuming for the petitioner to drive to
California to open a bank account. The minor does not have a US visa and cannot
travel to the United States to open a bank account if his presence is required
by the bank.’   
 
However, the above ‘additional
orders’ are not included in the proposed Order. 
(See proposed Order, No.13). 

 
The appointment of a guardian of
the estate of the minor must be done in probate court.  Once a guardian of the estate of the minor is
appointed, this Court can proceed with a hearing on instant petition allowing
guardian of the estate to weigh in on the “additional order” requested in
number 20.  Petitioner presents no
authority which allows this Court to impose orders on a guardian of the estate
once the money is paid to that individual per No.18(b)(1).”
 
(See 8/15/23 Minute Order).
 
Nothing has been filed since the 8/15/23 hearing. 
 
If counsel represents that steps are being taken to
address the issues set forth in the Court’s 8/15/23 Minute Order, the matter
will be continued.  If not, the petition
will be denied.
