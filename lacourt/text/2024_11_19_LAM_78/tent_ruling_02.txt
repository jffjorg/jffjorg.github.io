 Case Number:  20STCV36130    Hearing Date:   November 19, 2024    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78 ¿ 608 MATEO, LLC, Plaintiff(s), vs. RTS DISTRICT PATIENTS COLLECTIVE, INC., et al., Defendant(s). Case No.: 20STCV36130 Hearing Date: November 19, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING UNOPPOSED MOTION TO STRIKE DEFENDANT’S ANSWER TO FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT  I. BACKGROUND On December 2, 2021, plaintiff 608 Mateo, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against defendants Arts District Patients Collective, Inc., James Shaw, Ryan Jennemann (“Jennemann”), THC Design, THC Design, LLC, and Does 1 through 50 for breach of written contract and breach of written guaranty arising from the leasing of the premises commonly known as 608 S. Mateo Street and 609 Imperial Street, Los Angeles, California.¿The FAC sets forth two causes of action for (1) breach of written contract, and (2) breach of written guaranty. On January 4, 2022, defendants Jennemann and THC Design filed a collective Answer to Plaintiff’s FAC. On August 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion seeking to strike Jennemann’s Answer to the FAC and enter default against him pursuant to CCP §128, CCP §575.2, and Local Rules 3.10 and 3.25 on the grounds that Jennemann has failed to participate in the action and comply with the Court’s Orders and Rules. As of November 5, 2024, no opposition has been filed to the motion.  II. LEGAL STANDARD Every court has statutory power to preserve and enforce order in its immediate presence (Code Civ. Proc. § 128(a)(1)), to enforce order in the proceedings before it or before a person or persons empowered to conduct a judicial investigation under its authority (Id.., § 128(a)(2)), to provide for the orderly conduct of proceedings before it or its officers (Id., § 128(a)(3)), and to compel obedience to its judgments, orders, and process, and to the orders of a judge out of court, in an action or proceeding pending therein (Id., § 128(a)(4)). A court's right to control its own proceedings must be exercised in the light of the fundamental interest of the public in maintaining an independent bar.¿(Mowrer v. Superior Court¿(1969) 3 Cal.App.3d 223, 230; Del Junco v. Hufnagel (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 789, 799 [“Trial courts should only exercise this authority in extreme situations. . .”].)¿ “Although authorized to impose sanctions for violation of local rules [], courts ordinarily should avoid treating a curable violation of local procedural rules as the basis for crippling a litigant's ability to present his or her case.”¿(Elkins v. Superior Court (2007) 41 Cal.4th 1337, 1364; see also Kalivas v. Barry Controls Corp. (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1161 [“An order based upon a curable procedural defect (such as the failure to file a separate statement), which effectively results in a judgment against a party, is an abuse of discretion.”].)  III. DISCUSSION Plaintiff argues striking Jennemann’s Answer is warranted under Code Civ. Proc. § 575.2(a) because Jennemann failed to appear at the Status Conferences on July 20, 2023, August 1, 2023, December 13, 2023, March 15, 2024, and at the FSCs on July 8, 2024, July 22, 2024 and on July 29, 2024 pursuant to Local Rules 3.10 and 3.25(f) and (f)(1). Local Rule 3.10 states, “The court may impose appropriate sanctions for the failure or refusal to comply with the rules in this chapter, including the time standards and/or deadlines, and any court order made pursuant to the rules. Counsel are directed to Code of Civil Procedure sections 128, 128.7, 177.5, 575.2, 583.150, 583.430, 2016.010-2036.050, Government Code section 68608, and California Rules of Court, rule 2.30. The sanctions may be imposed on a party and, if appropriate, on counsel for that party.” Local Rule 3.25 provides in relevant part that “Counsel must attend a final status conference, which the court will set not more than ten days prior to the trial date” (Local Rule 3.25(f)) and that “At least five days prior to the final status conference, counsel must serve and file lists of pre-marked exhibits to be used at trial (Local Rules 3.151, 3.53, and 3.149), jury instruction requests, trial witness lists, and a proposed short statement of the case to be read to the jury panel explaining the case. Failure to exchange and file these items may result in not being able to call witnesses, present exhibits at trial, or have a jury trial” (Local Rule 3.25(f)(1)). Code Civ. Proc. § 575.2(a) states in relevant part that “Local rules promulgated pursuant to Section 575.1 may provide that if… a party if in pro se, fails to comply with any of the requirements thereof, the court on motion of a party or on its own motion may strike out all or any part of any pleading of that party, or, dismiss the action or proceeding or any part thereof, or enter a judgment by default against that party…. No penalty may be imposed under this section without prior notice to, and an opportunity to be heard by, the party against whom the penalty is sought to be imposed.” On October 28, 2022, Jennemann’s counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel was granted. As of November 7, 2022, Jennemann is unrepresented. (Notice of Order, Nov. 7, 2022.) Since then, there has been no appearance by Jennemann at any of the hearings to date, nor is there any indication that any party is in communication with him. No opposition has been filed to date. Considering Jennemann’s continuing absence in this matter over the course of two years, it is not apparent that any lesser penalties or sanctions would be effective. The motion will therefore be granted.    IV. CONCLUSION Plaintiff 608 Mateo, LLC’s motion to strike defendant Ryan Jennemann’s Answer to the FAC is GRANTED.  Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: November 18, 2024 __________________________ Hon.
