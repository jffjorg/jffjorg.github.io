Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to continue the trial by at least four months. The defendant, St. Cecilia Catholic School, filed the motion due to the unavailability of its lead trial counsel, Anthony Bellone, who is also counsel in another case, Depto v. St. Paul the Apostle Church. The defendant argues that it is impossible for Bellone to attend and try two trials simultaneously. The plaintiff, Frances Atkins, opposes the motion, arguing that the case is nearly six years old and that this is the fourth trial continuance. The judge finds that while there may be a potential conflict with the Depto case, it is unclear whether the trial in that case will actually proceed as scheduled. Therefore, the judge denies the motion to continue the trial without prejudice, meaning that the defendant may refile the motion if circumstances change.
