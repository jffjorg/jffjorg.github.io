Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendant Ryan Jennemann's Answer to the First Amended Complaint is granted. The judge finds that Jennemann has failed to participate in the action and comply with the court's orders and rules, including failing to appear at status conferences and final status conferences. The judge notes that Jennemann is unrepresented and has not communicated with the court or the opposing party. The judge concludes that striking Jennemann's Answer is the appropriate sanction, as lesser penalties or sanctions would not be effective. The judge orders that the motion be granted and that the moving party give notice.
