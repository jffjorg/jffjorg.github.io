And here is the English-text summary:

The Tentative Ruling denies the Plaintiff's request for default judgment without prejudice. The Plaintiff, Timothy D. Reuben, Inc., a California professional corporation, d/b/a Reuben Raucher & Blum, seeks a default judgment against the Defendants, Michael Winter, et al., in the amount of $80,104.73. However, the Court notes that the submitted default judgment package has a defect. Specifically, the declaration of Stephen L. Raucher states that the Defendants' balance as of September 30, 2021 was $61,234.82, but the Plaintiff's case summary asserts that the balance is $75,367.53. Additionally, the declaration states that the Defendants' balance as of October 31, 2023 was $75,367.53, which is different from the amount owed. The Court will discuss with the Plaintiff a schedule for resubmission of the default judgment package.
