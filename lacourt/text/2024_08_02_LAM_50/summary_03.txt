And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the Court's previous order granting summary adjudication to the defendants. The plaintiff argued that the order was based on erroneous assumptions of fact and law, but the judge found that the motion was untimely and procedurally improper. The judge also noted that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient new or different facts, circumstances, or law to support the motion. The plaintiff's motion was filed outside of the 10-day time limit set by the California Code of Civil Procedure, and the judge found that the motion was not properly served and filed. The judge also found that the plaintiff's declaration in support of the motion did not comply with the requirements of the California Code of Civil Procedure.
