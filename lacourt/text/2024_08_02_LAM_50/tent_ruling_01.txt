  ORDER RE:
 
DEFENDANT PI
  PROPERTIES NO. 79, LLC’S MOTION TO DISMISS FOR FAILURE TO BRING THE CASE TO
  TRIAL WITHIN THE PERIOD PRESCRIBED BY STATUTE




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 




            
Background
Plaintiff Freddy M., by and through his
guardian ad litem, Paola Mejia, Noe Reyes Lopez, and Paola Mejia (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) filed this action on November 16, 2018 against Defendants Joe
Oroñoz and Sarah Oroñoz. On February 13, 2019, Plaintiffs filed an amendment to
the Complaint naming PI
Properties No. 79, LLC (“PI Properties”) in place of “Doe 21.” 
Plaintiffs filed the operative Third
Amended Complaint (“TAC”) on June 26, 2020, alleging causes of action for (1) breach
of implied warranty of habitability, (2) tortious breach of implied warranty of
habitability, (3) negligence, (4) private nuisance, and (5) violation of Business and
Professions Code section 17200. This action concerns alleged uninhabitable
conditions at 6429 ½ S. Victoria Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90043 (the “Subject
Property”), where Plaintiffs reside. (TAC, ¶¶ 1, 16.) Plaintiffs allege, inter
alia, that deteriorated lead-based paint and other lead hazards at the
Subject Property resulted in Freddy M. contracting
lead poisoning and suffering permanent neurological, cognitive, and behavioral
harm… (TAC, 
¶
70.)
On June 29, 2020, PI
Properties filed a Cross-Complaint against a number of cross-defendants, alleging
causes of action for (1) declaratory relief, (2) implied equitable indemnity,
and (3) negligence.    
PI Properties now moves “for an
order to dismiss the above-entitled action for failure to bring the case to
trial within the period prescribed by the statute, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 583.310 and 583.360(a).” Plaintiffs
oppose. 
Discussion
Code of Civil Procedure section 583.310 provides, “[a]n action shall be
brought to trial within five years after the action is commenced against the
defendant.” Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 583.360, “(a) An action shall be dismissed by
the court on its own motion or on motion of the defendant, after notice to the
parties, if the action is not brought to trial within the time prescribed in
this article. (b) The requirements of this
article are mandatory and are not subject to extension, excuse, or exception
except as expressly provided by statute.” 
“In computing the time within
which an action must be brought to trial pursuant to this article, there shall
be excluded the time during which any of the following conditions existed: (a) The jurisdiction of the court to try the action was suspended. (b) Prosecution or trial of the
action was stayed or enjoined. (c) Bringing the action to trial,
for any other reason, was impossible, impracticable, or futile.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 583.340.) Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 583.330,
“[t]he parties may extend the time within which an action must be brought to
trial pursuant to this article by…written stipulation” and “[b]y oral agreement made in
open court, if entered in the minutes of the court or a transcript is made.” 
In addition, pursuant to Emergency Rule 10(a),
“[n]otwithstanding
any other law, including Code of Civil
Procedure section 583.310, for all civil actions filed on or before April
6, 2020, the time in which to bring the action to trial is extended by six
months for a total time of five years and six months.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Appen.
1, Emergency Rule 10(a).) 
As set forth above, the instant
action was filed on November 16, 2018. In her supporting declaration, PI
Properties’ counsel states that “[o]n April 6, 2020, the Judicial
Council of California enacted emergency rules due to the Covid-19 pandemic,
which extended the time frame to bring this lawsuit to trial by six months, for
a total of five years and six months. Hence, the statutory deadline to bring
this action to trial was May 16, 2024.” (Ciminelli Decl., ¶ 4.) Trial in this
matter is currently set for August 7, 2024. 
 PI
Properties asserts that “[a]s of the date of filing this Motion, the
lawsuit has yet to be brought to trial and Plaintiffs have not shown an
extension, excuse, or exception to justify their failure. Therefore, dismissal
is mandatory…” (Mot. at p. 11:24-26.) 
In
the opposition, Plaintiffs assert that “court congestion prevented this case
from going to trial and tolled the ‘five-year statute’…” (Opp’n at p. 4:11-12.)
As set forth above, “[i]n computing the time within which an action must
be brought to trial pursuant to this article, there shall be excluded the time
during which any of the following conditions existed:…(c) Bringing the action to trial, for any other
reason, was impossible, impracticable, or futile.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 583.340, subd. (c).)
Plaintiffs cite to Hattersley v. American Nucleonics Corp. (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 397, 401, where the Court of Appeal noted that “[i]n Chin v. Meier, supra, 235 Cal.App.3d 1373,
we held that section 583.340, subdivision (c)
tolling includes the aggregate time a case is continued because of courtroom
unavailability.” The Hattersley Court noted that “[c]ourt
congestion is not a valid basis for denying a litigant his or her day in court.” (Id. at p. 402.) 
In his
declaration in support of the opposition, Plaintiffs’ counsel states that “[o]n
January 26, 2024, the court heard the Final Status Conference (‘FSC’) on this
matter…As of this date, a jury trial was set to begin on February 14, 2024.” (Victoria
Decl., ¶ 7.) Plaintiff’s counsel states that he “appeared at the
FSC prepared to participate in the FSC and start trial on February 14, 2024.”
(Victoria Decl., ¶ 8.) Plaintiffs’ counsel states that “[c]ounsel for
Defendant, Mr. Caliguri, requested the court continue the trial date due to his
unavailability, as trial counsel, due to his wife’s pregnancy and impending
delivery date and his expected paternity leave, which coincided with the
February 14, 2024 trial date. Plaintiffs’ counsel did not object to defense
counsel’s request given the basis of the request but did raise the issue of the
five-year statute at the FSC.” (Victoria Decl., ¶ 10.) 
The Court’s January 26, 2024 minute order provides, inter alia,
that “[t]his case came from the PI Hub and the Court intends to send the case
for trial to the trial courts if available as previously represented to the
parties. Pursuant to the request of defendant, the Final Status Conference
scheduled for 01/26/2024 is continued to 03/14/24 at 02:00 PM in Department 50
at Stanley Mosk Courthouse…Pursuant to the request of defendant, the Jury Trial
scheduled for 02/14/2024 is continued to 04/17/24 at 08:30 AM in Department 50
at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.” 
Plaintiffs’ counsel states that on March 14, 2024 he attended the FSC,
and “appeared at the FSC prepared to participate in the FSC and start trial on
April 17, 2024.” (Victoria Decl., ¶¶ 12, 13.) Plaintiff’s counsel states that “[a]t
the FSC, the court informed the parties that Department 1 may not be able to
take the case to trial as scheduled on April 17, 2024…As such, the parties
agreed to have the court act as the trial court in order to get a firm trial
date of August 7, 2024. This was the first available trial date the court had
for the parties. As such, the court set the current August 7, 2024 trial date
pursuant to stipulation of both parties (Plaintiffs and Defendant).” (Victoria
Decl., ¶¶ 14-15.) 
The Court’s March 14, 2024 minute order provides, inter alia,
that “[t]he Court informs the parties that Department 1 may not be able to take
this case. The parties agree as does the Court that the case is now assigned to
Department 50 and the time to file a 170.6 runs from today’s date. Pursuant to
the discussion with Counsel re: available trial dates the trial is continued as
follows:…Final Status Conference is continued to 06/28/24 at 02:00 PM in
Department 50 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse. Jury Trial is continued to 08/07/24
at 09:30 AM in Department 50 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse.” Plaintiffs assert
that “due to court congestion, this matter has been ‘tolling’ since the
inability of this court to take this case to trial on April 17, 2024.” (Opp’n
at p. 6:15-16.) 
In the motion and in the reply, PI Properties cites to Gaines v. Fidelity National
Title Ins. Co. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 1081, 1100, where the California Supreme Court noted that “[a] circumstance that does not
qualify for automatic tolling under section 583.340(b)
may nonetheless be excludable from the five-year period if the circumstance
makes it ‘impossible, impracticable, or futile’ to bring the action to trial. (§ 583.340(c); accord, Bruns, supra, 51
Cal.4th at p. 726.) Gaines invokes this provision. In deciding whether these exceptions are met, the court must consider
‘all the circumstances in the individual case, including the acts and conduct of the
parties and the nature of the proceedings themselves…The critical factor in applying these exceptions
to a given factual situation is whether the plaintiff exercised reasonable
diligence in prosecuting his or her
case.’” 
PI Properties argues that
here, “Plaintiffs failed to timely commence trial due to their lack of due
reasonable diligence throughout the lifetime of the case.” (Reply at p.
3:13-14.) As set forth above, Plaintiffs’ counsel states that he raised the
issue of the five-year statute at the January 26, 2024 FSC. (Victoria
Decl., ¶ 10.) PI Properties asserts that “[t]here was plenty of time and
opportunity before and after the January 26, 2024, FSC to seek an order to
advance the trial date, preferentially set the trial[1],
or obtain a stipulation to waive the five-year statute.” (Reply at p. 3:24-26.)
However, as set forth above, Plaintiffs’ counsel states that he appeared at the
January 26, 2024 FSC “prepared to participate in the FSC and start trial on
February 14, 2024,” and that he appeared at the March 14, 2024 FSC “prepared to
participate in the FSC and start trial on April 17, 2024.” (Victoria Decl., ¶¶
8, 13.) In addition, as discussed, Plaintiffs’ counsel states that he raised
the issue of the five-year statute at the January 26, 2024 FSC. (Victoria
Decl., ¶ 10.) The Court finds that reasonable diligence has been sufficiently
shown. 
PI Properties also asserts that “the period between April 17, 2024,
and August 7, 2024 is not tolled.” (Reply at p. 4:17.) PI Properties cites to Oswald v. Landmark Builders, Inc. (2023) 97 Cal.App.5th
240, 248, where the
Court of Appeal noted that “[t]he unavailability of courtrooms for trial does not
automatically lead to a finding of an impossible or impractical circumstance
under section 583.340(c). Rather, the trial court
is tasked with determining the extent to which the unavailability of courtrooms
for trial interfered with a plaintiff’s ability to mov[e] the case to
trial during the relevant period[s]. We conclude the trial court here acted
well within its discretion in determining that the courtroom closure and trial
continuance at issue did not make it illegally impossible or impractical for
plaintiffs to commence trial in a timely fashion. Rather, plaintiffs’ failure
to timely commence trial was due to a lack of reasonable diligence, i.e., they
were never ready for trial during the relevant periods.” (Internal quotations and citations omitted.) But
here, as discussed, Plaintiffs’ counsel states that he was prepared to start
trial on February 14, 2024 and on April 17, 2024.” (Victoria Decl., ¶¶
8, 13.)[2]
PI Properties also asserts that “the March 14, 2024, Minute Order says
nothing about courtroom congestion…Nothing in the Order indicates that
Department 50 could not take this case to trial before the statutory deadline.”
(Reply at p. 5:15-19.) As discussed, the March 14, 2024 minute order provides, inter
alia, that “[t]he Court informs the parties that Department 1 may not be
able to take this case. The parties agree as does the Court that the case is
now assigned to Department 50…Pursuant to the discussion with Counsel re:
available trial dates the trial is continued as follows:…Jury Trial is
continued to 08/07/24…” However, as discussed, Plaintiffs’ counsel states in
his declaration that “[a]t the FSC, the court informed the parties that
Department 1 may not be able to take the case to trial as scheduled on April
17, 2024…As such the parties agreed to have the court act as the trial court in
order to get a firm trial date of August 7, 2024. This was the first
available trial date the court had for the parties. As such, the court set
the current August 7, 2024 trial date pursuant to stipulation of both parties…”
(Victoria Decl., ¶¶ 14-15, emphasis added.) 
In light of the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have shown
that Code of Civil Procedure section 583.340, subdivision
(c) tolling applies under the circumstances here. As set forth above, “section 583.340, subdivision (c) tolling includes the aggregate time a case is continued
because of courtroom unavailability.” ((Hattersley v. American Nucleonics Corp., supra, 3
Cal.App.4th at p. 401.) Thus, the Court does not find that PI Properties has shown
that the instant action must be dismissed because it was “not
brought to trial within the time prescribed in [Code
of Civil Procedure sections 583.310-583.360].” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 583.360, subd. (a).) 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing,
the Court denies PI Properties’ motion to dismiss. 
The Court orders Plaintiffs
to give notice of this ruling.
