PLAINTIFF MATTHEW PORPORA’S AMENDED MOTION FOR
RECONSIDERATION OF ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR SUMMARY ADJUDICATION (filed 07/12/2024) 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s motion is denied.  
 
BACKGROUND 
 
On July 21, 2020, Plaintiff Matthew
Porpora (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against a number of defendants. Plaintiff’s
Complaint alleges causes of action for (1) violation of Health
and Safety Code section 1432, (2) violation of Health
and Safety Code section 1278.5, (3) violation of Labor
Code section 1102.5, and (4) wrongful termination in violation of public
policy.  
 
On April 7, 2022, Plaintiff filed an
amendment to the Complaint naming National Mentor Healthcare, LLC in place of
“Doe 1.” On November 2, 2022, Plaintiff filed an amendment to the Complaint
naming National Mentor Holdings, LLC in place of “Doe 2.” On November 2, 2022,
Plaintiff also filed an amendment to the Complaint naming National Mentor
Holdings, Inc. in place of “Doe 3.”
 
Defendants
National Mentor Healthcare, LLC, National Mentor Holdings, Inc., and National
Mentor Holdings, LLC (collectively, the “NM Defendants”) previously moved for
summary adjudication on the first and second causes of action of the Complaint,
and on claims for punitive damages and attorney fees. Plaintiff opposed.
 
On
November 9, 2023, the Court issued a minute order providing, inter alia,
that “the NM Defendants’ motion for summary adjudication is granted as to
Plaintiff’s first and second causes of action, Plaintiff’s claim for punitive
damages, and Plaintiff’s claim for attorney’s fees in connection with his first,
second, and third causes of action. The NM Defendants’ motion for summary
adjudication of Plaintiff’s claim for attorney’s fees in connection with the
fourth cause of action is denied. The Clerk is to provide notice to counsel for
Plaintiff, who is to give notice to all parties.” 
 
On July 12,
2024, Plaintiff filed the instant amended motion “for
order of reconsideration of, and to withdraw the Court’s November 9, 2023 Order…denying,
in part, and granting, in part, the motion of the NM Defendants, for summary
adjudication…” Plaintiff’s motion argues:

·      
“Reconsideration of the adjudication
order is warranted with respect to the first and second causes of action
because it is based on the erroneous assumption of fact, induced by misleading
defense argument, that ‘Plaintiff’ ‘Solely’ Relied ‘on Evidence that NMH
Provided Support Services’.” (Mot. at p. 10:1-3.)
 
·      
“Reconsideration is warranted as to the
punitive damages claim because the order was based on erroneous assumptions of
fact and ‘bad law’ induced by misleading defense argument, which the Court can
now rectify via a reconsideration order.” (Mot. at p. 12:6-9.) 
 
·      
“Reconsideration of the adjudication
order is warranted as to the claim of attorney fees pertaining to Labor Code section 1102.5 because it is based on the
erroneous assumption, that it has an impermissible retroactive effect when
applied to this case, and recent controlling case law justify reconsideration.”
(Mot. at p. 15:14-18.) 
 
·      
“Plaintiff Porpora’s motion for
reconsideration of the extraordinary order of November 9, 2023 granting summary
adjudication is timely and procedurally proper.” (Mot. at p. 17:3-4.) 
On July 24, 2024, the NM
Defendants filed their opposition, arguing:
·      
“Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration
is late on multiple grounds and should be denied.” (Opp’n at p. 9:8.) 
 
·      
“Plaintiff’s motion also fails to
identify any new law or facts to support his motion.” (Opp’n at p. 11:15-16.)  
 
·      
Plaintiff’s attorney affidavit does not
meet the requirements of Section 1008.” (Opp’n at
p. 13:1.) 
 
·      
Plaintiff’s motion asking the Court to
reconsider its ruling based on its inherent authority is procedurally
improper.” (Opp’n at p. 13:15-16.) 
On July 26, 2024, Plaintiff filed his reply,
arguing:
·      
“No authority cited by Defendant refutes
that Plaintiff had ‘ten days from service of’ his June 19, 2024 notice of entry
of order to file his motion for reconsideration; Porpora did just that, thereby
rendering his statutory motion timely.” (Reply at p. 4:3-5.) 
 
·      
“Reconsideration of the adjudication
order is warranted given the erroneous assumption of facts, induced by
misleading defense argument, that led to the order.” (Reply at p. 5:15-17.)
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE 
 
The Court grants Plaintiff’s request for
judicial notice. 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
Code of
Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a)¿ provides as follows: 
 
“When an application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a
court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally,
or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service
upon the party of written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or
different facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or
court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or
revoke the prior order. The party making the application shall state by
affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what order
or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law
are claimed to be shown.” 
 
Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (e), “[t]his section specifies the court’s jurisdiction
with regard to applications for reconsideration of its orders and renewals of
previous motions, and applies to all applications to reconsider any order of a
judge or court, or for the renewal of a previous motion, whether the order
deciding the previous matter or motion is interim or final. No application to
reconsider any order or for the renewal of a previous motion may be considered
by any judge or court unless made according to this section.” 
 
The legislative intent was to restrict
motions for reconsideration to circumstances where a party offers the court
some fact or circumstance not previously considered, and some valid reason for
not offering it earlier. (¿¿Gilberd v. AC
Transit (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1494, 1500¿¿; ¿¿Mink v.
Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1342 [“[T]he party seeking reconsideration
must provide not only new evidence but also a satisfactory explanation for the
failure to produce that evidence at an earlier time.”]¿¿; ¿New York Times
Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135
Cal.App.4th 206, 212-213 [“The
burden under section 1008 is comparable to that of a party seeking a new trial
on the ground of newly discovered evidence: the information must be such that
the moving party could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered or
produced it at the trial.”]¿.)
 
B.      Procedural
Issues 
 
Timeliness

 
As an
initial matter, the NM Defendants assert that Plaintiff’s motion for
reconsideration is late on multiple grounds. 
 
As noted by
the NM Defendants, the Court’s November 9, 2023 minute order provides, inter
alia, that “[t]he Clerk is to provide notice to
counsel for Plaintiff, who is to give notice to all parties. Certificate of
Mailing is attached.” 
 
A
Certificate of Mailing was filed on November 9, 2023 providing, inter alia,
that “I, the below-named Executive Officer/Clerk of the above-entitled court,
do hereby certify that I am not a party to the cause herein, and that on this
date I served the Minute Order (Hearing on Motion for Summary Adjudication
continued from 8/1...) of 11/09/2023 upon each party or counsel named below by
placing the  document for collection and
mailing so as to cause it to be deposited in the United States mail at the courthouse
in Los Angeles, California, one copy of the original filed/entered herein in a separate
sealed envelope to each address as shown below with the postage thereon fully
prepaid, in accordance with  standard
court practices.” “David Robert Denis” is listed on the Certificate of Mailing,
which is dated November 9, 2023. 
 
The NM
Defendants assert that “[a]ccordingly, the clerk’s service of
the Order triggered the 10-day period, which, after accounting for service via
mail, would have expired on November 24, 2023.” (Opp’n.
at p. 9:24-25.) 15 days after November 9, 2023 is November 24, 2023. 
 
In the
motion, Plaintiff asserts that “no written notice
of entry of the order of November 9, 2023, granting NM Defendants’ motion for
summary adjudication issued and was served until June 19, 2024. The Court
ordered that notice of the order be given; a Notice of Entry of that Order was
served electronically on June 19, 2024, making tenth day from ‘service of’ that
notice, Tuesday, July 2, 2024. Hence, Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is
timely.” (Mot. at p. 17:19-23.) 
 
On June 20,
2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Entry of Order Denying in Part and Granting
in Part Defendants’ Motion for Summary Adjudication. The proof of service
attached to this notice indicates that the notice was served on June 19, 2024
by email. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6,
subdivision (a)(3)(B), “[a]ny period of notice, or any right or duty to do any act or make
any response within any period or on a date certain after the service of the
document, which time period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of court,
shall be extended after service by electronic means by two court days…”

 
With respect to the 10-day time limit
set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 1008,
subdivision (a), ten days
after June 19, 2024 is June 29, 2024. Two court days after June 29, 2024 is
July 2, 2024.  
 
However, the instant amended motion
for reconsideration was filed on July 12, 2024. The docket for this case also
shows that Plaintiff filed an initial motion for reconsideration on July 5,
2024. The docket only shows that Plaintiff’s “Request for Judicial Notice in
Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration of Order Granting Defendants’
Motion for Summary Adjudication of Issues” (Parts 1 and 2) were filed on July
2, 2024. 
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court does
not find that Plaintiff has shown that his motion for reconsideration is timely
under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision
(a).  
 
Service and Filing Requirements 
 
In addition, as noted by the NM Defendants,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1005,
subdivision (b), “[u]nless otherwise ordered or
specifically provided by law, all moving and supporting papers shall be served
and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing.” 
 
Here, 16
court days prior to the August 2, 2024 hearing on the instant motion is July
11, 2024. However, the instant motion was filed on July 12, 2024. 
 
In addition,
the proof of service attached to the motion indicates that it was served by
email on July 11, 2024. However, as set forth above, “[a]ny period of notice, or any right or duty to do any act or make
any response within any period or on a date certain after the service of the
document, which time period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of court,
shall be extended after service by electronic means by two court days…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6, subd.
(a)(3)(B). 16 court
days prior to August 2, 2024 is July 11, 2024, and two court days prior to July
11, 2024 (for electronic service) is July 9, 2024. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court agrees with the NM Defendants that the instant motion was
untimely filed and served. 
 
New or
Different Facts, Circumstances, or Law 
 
In addition, as noted by the NM Defendants,
Plaintiff does not appear to explain in the motion what “new or different facts, circumstances, or law” are purportedly
applicable here under Code of Civil Procedure section
1008, subdivision (a). 
 
Further, as set forth above, “[t]he party making the application
shall state by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what
judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts,
circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008,
subd. (a).) Here, the Declaration of Armando M. Galvan in
support of the motion does not state “what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.” (Ibid.)
 
The Court notes that Plaintiff filed second
declaration in support of the reply. However, “¿[t]he general rule of motion practice…is that new
evidence is not permitted with reply papers.¿”¿(¿Jay¿v. Mahaffey
 (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th
1522, 1537.) Moreover, the Declaration of David R. Denis in support of the
reply still does not appear to clearly state what “new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed to be
shown.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1008,
subd. (a).)
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 128, subdivision (a)(8) 
 
Plaintiff also moves for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure section 128, subdivision (a)(8),
which provides that “[e]very court shall have the
power to do all of the following:…(8) To amend and control its process and
orders so as to make them conform to law and justice.” The NM Defendants assert
that “Plaintiff’s motion asking the Court to reconsider its ruling based on its
inherent authority is procedurally improper.” (Opp’n at p. 13:15-16.) 
 
In Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 Cal.4th 1094, 1108, cited by both parties, the California Supreme Court
noted that “[w]e cannot prevent a party from communicating the view
to a court that it should reconsider a prior ruling (although any such
communication should never be ex parte). We agree that it should not matter
whether the judge has an unprovoked flash of understanding in the middle of the
night or acts in response to a party’s suggestion. If a court believes one of
its prior interim orders was erroneous, it should be able to correct that error
no matter how it came to acquire that belief. For example, nothing would prevent the losing party from asking
the court at a status conference to reconsider a ruling. But a party
may not file a written motion to
reconsider that has procedural significance if it does not satisfy the
requirements of section 437c, subdivision (f)(2),
or 1008.” (Internal quotations and citations omitted,
italics in original, underline added.) 
 
C.     
Conclusion
 
In light of the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for
reconsideration is denied.
