Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Matthew Porpora's motion for reconsideration of the order granting summary adjudication to the Defendants. The Plaintiff had argued that the order was based on erroneous assumptions of fact and law, and that reconsideration was warranted. However, the Court found that the motion was untimely and did not meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. The Court also noted that the Plaintiff did not provide sufficient new facts or circumstances to support the motion for reconsideration. As a result, the Court denied the motion for reconsideration.
