[1]PI Properties’
counsel states that “[o]n May 10, 2021, Plaintiffs moved for a trial preference
and requested the Court to set the case for trial at the earliest possible date
on the grounds that Plaintiff, Freddy M., is under 14 years old, needs a
resolution on this case, and by law, is entitled to it. Plaintiffs’ Motion for
Trial Preference was granted by the Court.” (Ciminelli Decl., ¶ 5.) PI
Properties’ counsel asserts that “[s]oon after the Court granted Plaintiffs’
Motion for Trial Preference, Plaintiffs waived their right to trial preference.”
(Ciminelli Decl., ¶ 7.)


[2]In the reply, PI
Properties asserts that “[a]s evidenced in the transcript from the January 24,
2024, FSC, the Court found both Parties were not ready for trial. (Exhibit A to
Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, pp. 5:3-11:27, 14:14-22). The Court ordered the
Parties to meet and confer to reduce the witness list and to eliminate
objections, and file updated witness and exhibit lists.” (Reply at p. 6:4-7.) However,
PI Properties does not appear to dispute that Plaintiffs were ready for trial
on April 17, 2024.
