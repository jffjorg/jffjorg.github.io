assert that “plaintiffs must specifically ‘allege the names of the persons who
made the allegedly fraudulent representations, their authority to speak, to
whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or written.”
(Demurrer at p. 8:1-2.) But in support of this assertion, Defendants cite to Lazar v.
Superior Court, supra, at page 645, where the California Supreme Court noted that “[a] plaintiff’s burden in asserting a fraud claim against
a corporate employer is even greater. In such a case, the plaintiff must
allege the names of the persons who made the allegedly fraudulent
representations, their authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said
or wrote, and when it was said or written.” (Internal quotations omitted,
emphasis added.) The Defendants here are individuals, not corporations.
