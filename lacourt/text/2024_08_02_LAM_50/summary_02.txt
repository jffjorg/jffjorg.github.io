And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is reviewing a trial preference motion filed by the plaintiff, Freddy M., on May 10, 2021. The motion was granted by the court, citing the plaintiff's age and the need for a resolution. However, PI Properties, the defendant, asserts that the plaintiff later waived their right to trial preference. The court notes that the parties were not ready for trial on January 24, 2024, and ordered them to meet and confer to reduce the witness list and eliminate objections. The judge is considering whether the plaintiff is still entitled to trial preference on April 17, 2024, and will likely issue a final ruling on this matter.
