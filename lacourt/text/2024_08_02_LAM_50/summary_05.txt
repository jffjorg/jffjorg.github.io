```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the Defendant's assertion that the Plaintiff must specifically allege the names of the individuals who made the allegedly fraudulent representations, their authority, and other relevant details. The Defendant cites to a California Supreme Court ruling in Lazar v. Superior Court, which states that in cases involving a corporate employer, the Plaintiff must make such allegations. However, the Judge notes that the Defendants in this case are individuals, not corporations, and therefore the same burden does not apply. The Judge's ruling suggests that the Plaintiff may need to provide more specific information about the alleged fraudulent representations in order to move forward with their case.
