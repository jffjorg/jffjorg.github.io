And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff, ODK Capital, LLC, had filed a complaint against the defendant, Charles Cooper, alleging breach of contract and seeking default judgment. However, the court noted several defects in the plaintiff's application, including the failure of its custodian of records to provide a copy of the assignment of the claim from Celtic Bank to ODK Capital, LLC. The court also expressed concerns about the authenticity of the purported assignment and the lack of Exhibit A, which was referred to in the assignment. As a result, the judge denied the application for default judgment without prejudice, allowing the parties to address the defects before the scheduled hearing date.
