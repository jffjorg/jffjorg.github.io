And here is a summary in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary adjudication filed by the plaintiff, Deeanne Linsmaier, against the defendant, Wail Bushara. The plaintiff was injured in a car accident caused by the defendant's negligence, and the defendant has conceded that the plaintiff's contributory negligence, failure to state a claim, and the running of the statute of limitations are not valid affirmative defenses.

The court grants summary adjudication on Issues 1-3, namely, the plaintiff's contributory negligence, failure to state a claim, and the running of the statute of limitations. However, the court denies summary adjudication on Issue 4, namely, the defendant's affirmative defense of comparative negligence.

The court's decision is based on the evidence presented by the parties, including deposition testimony, declarations, and insurance investigative reports. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to establish that the third party, Matthew Muldoon, was not negligent. The court concludes that the defendant's affirmative defense of comparative negligence is valid and that the plaintiff has failed to meet her initial burden.

Unless all parties submit to this tentative ruling, they should arrange to appear remotely or in person for oral argument on the hearing date.
