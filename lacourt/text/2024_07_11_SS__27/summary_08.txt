And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Daniel Geoulla vs. California Automobile Insurance Company. The case involves an uninsured motorist claim arising from a rear-end accident on October 3, 2013. The claimant, Daniel Geoulla, alleges injuries to his neck, back, knees, ankle, and wrist, and has undergone several medical examinations.

The respondent, California Automobile Insurance Company, has moved the court to compel a second independent medical examination (IME) and to request evidentiary sanctions against the claimant. The judge has denied the motion to compel a second IME without prejudice, citing procedural deficiencies in the respondent's motion.

However, the judge has granted the claimant's motion to compel arbitration, and has set the arbitration date for December 9, 2024. The judge has also ordered the parties to meet and confer regarding the requested second IME.

The judge has noted that the claimant's condition is worsening, and that a second IME would be appropriate for assessing the current status of the injury. The judge has also disagreed with the claimant's reading of Shapira v. Superior Court (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 1249, which held that multiple examinations are only permitted when there is a showing of good cause and the claimant's injuries are "complex."

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is a significant development in the case, and may have important implications for the parties' future actions.
