And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for relief from dismissal. The plaintiff's counsel failed to attend a hearing, which resulted in the dismissal of the case with prejudice. The plaintiff now moves the court to vacate the dismissal, citing a calendaring error as the cause of the failure to attend the hearing. The court finds that the relief is mandatory and that the dismissal was caused by the attorney's inadvertence. Therefore, the court grants the motion and sets a hearing date for further argument.
