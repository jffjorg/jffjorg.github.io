And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case between Jermaine Sterling (plaintiff) and DeroosPro LLC (defendant). The defendant served the plaintiff with discovery requests, including Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Requests for Production of Documents, and Requests for Admission, on March 27, 2024. The deadline for initial responses was April 30, 2024, but the plaintiff failed to respond. The defendant sent a meet and confer letter on May 1, 2024, but received no response. The defendant then filed motions to compel initial responses, deem requests for admissions admitted, and impose sanctions.

The judge has granted the motions, deeming the requests for admissions admitted and ordering the plaintiff to provide complete and verified responses to the defendant's discovery requests within 30 days. The judge has also imposed sanctions of $2000 on the plaintiff and his counsel, jointly and severally, to pay to the defendant.
