```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal order due to the plaintiff's failure to timely prosecute the case and bring it to judgment within three years. The court dismissed the case with prejudice on December 5, 2023, after the plaintiff failed to appear at an Order to Show Cause hearing and did not file a proper default judgment package. The plaintiff's counsel's argument that it was a miscalendaring that led to the non-appearance is not valid, as the court's minute order reflects that the case was dismissed due to the plaintiff's failure to prosecute the case. The court has also denied the plaintiff's motion because no default judgment package was attached to the present motion.
