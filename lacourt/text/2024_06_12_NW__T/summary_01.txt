And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to file a Second Amended Complaint. The plaintiff had previously filed a First Amended Complaint, which was answered by the defendant. The defendant had moved for judgment on the pleadings, which was denied. The plaintiff now seeks to amend to address issues in the previous pleadings. The defendant opposes the motion, citing a lack of compliance with court rules and a lack of evidence to support the motion. The court has considered the motion and finds that the plaintiff has met the requirements of Section 3.1324 and has presented a sufficient declaration to support the motion. The court grants the motion and allows the plaintiff to file a Second Amended Complaint.
