instant department.

Discussion
Plaintiffs’ application for default judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
1.                 
Plaintiffs have utilized an outdated Judicial Council
Form CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2020]. Any further submission must be made on the
most current version of Judicial Council Form CIV-100 (i.e. [Rev. January 1,
2023]).
2.                 
Plaintiffs’ request for attorney’s fees appears
improper. First, Plaintiffs are self-
represented. It is unclear what
“LDA” means. Plaintiffs have not provided the court with any authority
entitling them to attorney’s fees under such circumstances. Second, Plaintiffs
have failed to articulate a statutory or contractual basis for attorney’s fees.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1021). Third, Plaintiffs have not requested attorney’s fees
in their complaint: “The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is
no answer, cannot exceed that demanded in the complaint. . .” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 580, subd. (a).)
3.                 
Plaintiffs’ request for interest likewise appears
improper, inasmuch as they have not requested same in the complaint.
4.                 
Plaintiffs request $64,608.00 in Paragraph 2.a. of
Judicial Council Form CIV-100; 
however, Plaintiffs have not set
forth any monetary amounts in the complaint: “[T]he language of section 580
does not extinguish between the type and the amount of relief sought. The plain
meaning of the prohibition against relief ‘exceed(ing)’ that demanded in the
complaint encompasses both of these considerations.” (Becker v. S.P.V.
Construction Co. (1980) 27 Cal.3d 489, 493-494). 
5.                 
Paragraph 7 of Plaintiffs’ proposed judgment reads as
follows: “The calculation of the interest rate and itemization of the property
damage is attached hereto as MC-030 along with the Exhibit “A.” There are no
additional pages attached to the proposed judgment, however. It appears
Plaintiffs desire to have their declaration attached to the proposed judgment,
which is improper. 
6.                 
Plaintiffs’ declaration is deficient. It is not made on
personal knowledge and fails to provide the court with any factual information
other than the date of loss and a calculation of damages. Plaintiffs attach numerous
documents to their declaration without authenticating same and explaining what
relevance they have. It is unclear to the court whether Plaintiffs’ vehicle was
declared a total loss or if they were able to have it repaired. Plaintiffs seek
$10,850.55 in car repairs yet also appear to seek to recoup the $31,990.00
purchase price of the vehicle, PLUS Plaintiffs’ $13,000.00 down payment made at
the time of purchase of the vehicle, PLUS the $2,215.00 “JM&A MAINTENANCE”
fee listed in Paragraph 1(I)(1) in the Retail Installment Sales Contract and
the $2,995.00 “JM&A SERV” fee listed in Paragraph 1(I)(2) of same. These
last three amounts comprise part of the $31,990.00 purchase price of the
vehicle and are not additional to the purchase price. Plaintiffs do not provide
the court with any Bluebook or other comparable valuation of the vehicle at the
time of the accident.
