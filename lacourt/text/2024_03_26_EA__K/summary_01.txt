And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the Plaintiffs' application for default judgment without prejudice. The Plaintiffs, Alexander Verduzco and Carina Gomez, seek damages and attorney's fees after their vehicle was struck by another vehicle on September 17, 2021, in La Puente. The Plaintiffs filed a complaint on November 9, 2021, and obtained defaults against the Defendants, Helen Reyes and Felix Berto Reyes. However, the Judge notes several defects in the Plaintiffs' submission, including the use of an outdated Judicial Council form, an improper request for attorney's fees, and an unclear calculation of damages. The Judge also points out that the Plaintiffs have not requested interest in their complaint and that their proposed judgment is incomplete. As a result, the Judge denies the Plaintiffs' application for default judgment without prejudice, allowing them to correct these defects and resubmit their application.
