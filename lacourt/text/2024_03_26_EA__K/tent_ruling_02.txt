Legal Standard
“[T]he
demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand
if the demanding party deems that. . . (1) A statement of compliance with the
demand is incomplete[,] (2) A representation of inability to comply is
inadequate, incomplete, or evasive [and/or] (3) An objection in the response is
without merit or too general.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)
The moving party must demonstrate a
“reasonable and good faith attempt” at an informal resolution of each issue
presented. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) “In lieu of
a separate statement required under the California Rules of Court, the court
may allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request
and each response in dispute.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(3).)
A motion to compel further responses to a demand for
inspection or production of documents must “set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) If the moving party has shown good cause for the
production of documents, the burden is on the objecting party to justify the
objections. (Kirkland v. Superior Court
(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 92, 98.) 
Notice
of the motion must be provided “within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the demanding party and the responding party have agreed in
writing . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.310, subd. (c).)
“[T]he court shall impose a monetary sanction. . . against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310,
subd. (h).)
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the
court, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.310, for an order striking
Defendant’s objections and compelling Defendant’s further responses to
Plaintiff’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set One (i.e., Nos. 1-31).
Plaintiff’s counsel Chris
Grigoryan (“Grigoryan”) represents as follows:
On
November 10, 2023, Plaintiff propounded the subject discovery on Defendant. (Grigoryan
Decl., ¶ 18, Exh. 3.) On December 11, 2023, Defendant provided responses. (Id.,
¶ 19, Exh. 4.) On December 15, 2023, Grigoryan sent Defendant’s counsel Soheyl
Tahsildoost (“Tahsildoost”) a meet and confer letter, requesting therein that Tahsildoost
provide a response thereto by December 22, 2023. (Id., ¶ 21, Exh. 5.) On
December 22, 2023, Defendant’s counsel Kevin Zipser (“Zipser”) sent a response
letter. (Id., ¶ 26, Exh. 6). On December 29, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel
purportedly sent another meet and confer letter. (Id., ¶ 28).[1] On
February 6, 2024, both parties attended an informal discovery conference,
during which the court indicated that Plaintiff could proceed with filing the
instant motion if discovery issues were still outstanding after February 13,
2024. This motion followed on February 21, 2024.
Plaintiff represents that Requests Nos. 1-14 pertain to her
own vehicle, that Requests Nos. 15-29 pertain to Defendant’s written warranty and policies and procedures related to what
is covered under said warranties, how coverage is determined, and training
related to warranty coverage, and that Requests Nos. 30 and 31 pertain to
documents related to Defendant’s knowledge of the same or similar defects in
other vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the subject vehicle.
(Motion, 6:3-16).
The court addresses
these categories as follows:
Plaintiffs’ Vehicle (i.e., Requests Nos. 1-14)
Request No. 1 seeks documents regarding the subject vehicle
that are within Defendant’s Customer Relations Center.
Request No. 2 seeks documents that support each of
Defendant’s affirmative defenses.
Request No. 3 seeks documents relating to any inspection of
the subject vehicle.
Request No. 4 seeks repair orders pertaining to the subject
vehicle.
Request No. 5 seeks documents, including manuals, and
express warranty booklets provided to consumers with respect to the purchase or
lease of the subject vehicle.
Request No. 6 seeks documents relating to any Retail
Installment Sales Contracts and/or Lease Agreements, including any associated
documents reflecting OEM or aftermarket installed parts, service contracts, and
any other writings signed by Plaintiff, in connection with the subject vehicle.
Request No. 7 seeks documents relating to all diagnostic
trouble codes that are electronically stored by Defendant or Defendant’s
authorized repair facility as a result of any inspections or repairs conducted
on the subject vehicle.
Request No. 8 seeks documents, including recalls, technical
service bulletins, and dealer advisories that were issued for the subject
vehicle.
Request No. 9 seeks documents relating to any contact or
communications between Defendant and Defendant’s authorized repair facility
regarding the subject vehicle.
Request No. 10 seeks documents that relate to any summaries
of all warranty repairs performed on the subject vehicle.
Request No. 11 seeks documents relating to any summaries of
all amounts paid by Defendant for warranty repairs performed on the subject
vehicle.
Request No. 12 seeks photographs or videotapes of the subject
vehicle taken by Defendant or Defendant’s authorized repair facility.
Request No. 13 seeks all documents relating to any contact
or communication between Defendant and Plaintiff.
Request No. 14 seeks all documents relating to any contact
or communications with any third parties relating to the subject vehicle.
Defendant has asserted a myriad of objections to the
foregoing requests, including that they are vague and ambiguous (as to Requests
Nos. 1-4 and 6-14), overly broad (as to Requests Nos. 1-14), oppressive (as to
Request No. 1), compound (as to Request No. 14), harassing (as to Requests Nos.
3, 4 and 7), unduly burdensome (as to Requests Nos. 3, 4 and 7), seek irrelevant
information (as to Requests Nos. 1-4 and 7-8), seek equally available
information (as to Request No. 5), are not full and complete in and of
themselves and require reference to other documents (as to Request No. 1), are
conclusory, devoid of facts, and call for speculation (as to Request No.1),
call for a legal conclusion and/or legal analysis (as to Request No. 1), ask
Defendant to respond on behalf of another entity (as to Requests Nos. 1-4 and
9-14), seek information protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or the
attorney work product doctrine (as to Requests Nos. 2-4, 6, 9-11, 13 and 14),
fail to describe with reasonable particularity the documents or categories of
documents being requested (as to Requests Nos. 2- and  6-14), are beyond the scope of Plaintiff’s
allegations (as to Request No. 8), are directed to concerns for which the
subject vehicle was presented only one time to an authorized repair facility as
concerns presented only once cannot qualify the subject vehicle for repurchase
(as to Request No. 8) and/or call for information that is confidential,
commercially sensitive and proprietary or trade secret (as to Requests Nos. 2, 3,
9-11, 13 and 14).
Defendant, in opposition, contends that its objections “are
necessary based on the phrasing of the requests” (See Opp. Sep. Statement,
3:14, 6:10, 9:5, 11:25, 14:7, 16:21, 19:8, 22:1, 24:22, 27:14, 30:6, 32:14,
35:6 and 37:25) and that Plaintiff included qualifying phrases which expanded
the reach of the requests “beyond what is specifically asked for, but in a
manner that is ambiguous in violation of the requirement that a request be
reasonably particular under Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.030(c)(1)” (Id.,
3:25-27, 6:21-23, 9:16-18, 12:9-11, 14:18-20, 17:5-7, 19:19-21, 22:12-14,
25:6-8, 27:25-27, 30:17-19, 32:25-27, 35:17-19 and 38:9-11). Defendant fails to
meet its burden of justifying any of its objections.
Defendant then asserts that its “technical objections do not
preclude [its] substantive responses, and [Defendant] provided code compliant
responses to all of the discovery responses at issue. . .” (Id., 4:15-17,
7:11-13, 10:6-8, 12:26-13:1, 15:7-9, 17:22-24, 20:9-11, 23:2-4, 25:23-25,
28:15-17, 31:7-9, 33:15-17, 36:7-9 and 38:26-39:1).
With respect to Requests Nos. 1-5, 9-11, 13 and 14,
Defendant represents that it responded that “documents in the requested
category in [its] possession, custody, or control and to which no objection was
being made would be included in the production, that “[t]his is compliant with
Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.220” and that “[n]o further response is
warranted.” (Id., 5:1-3, 7:24-26, 10:18-20, 13:12-14, 15:20-22, 26:9-11,
29:1-3, 31:20-22, 36:20-22 and 39:12-14). The court disagrees.
As Plaintiff points out, where Defendant agrees to comply
with a Request, Defendant thereafter fails to state that it will produce all
documents and things in the demanded category that are in its possession,
custody or control but instead uses words to the effect that it will produce
documents and things to which it has no objection. (See, as an example, the
phrasing used in response to Request No. 1 [“Subject to and without waiving
these objections, the requested production will be allowed in whole and all
documents in the demanded category that are in the possession, custody, or
control of AHM, and to which no objection is being made, will be included in
the production, including the following documents. . .”].) Said responses do
not comply with Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2031.220 and 2031.240; as such,
further responses are warranted.
With respect to Requests Nos. 6-8 and 12, Defendant
represents that it “provided code compliant responses indicating it was unable
to comply with each request and that pursuant to a diligent search and
reasonable inquiry, [it] had no responsive documents,” and that “[n]o further
response[s] [are] warranted.” (Opp. Sep. Statement, 18:7-11, 20:20-24, 23:14-18
and 33:27-34:4). Defendant’s Response to No. 6, however, does not comply with
Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.230, in that Defendant fails to “specify whether
the inability to comply is because the particular item or category has never
existed, has been destroyed, has been lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never
been, or is no longer, in the possession, custody, or control of the responding
party,” as well as “the name and address of any natural person or organization
known or believed by that party to have possession, custody, or control of that
item or category of item.” A further response is warranted.
With that said, the court believes that Defendant’s responses
to Requests Nos. 7 and 8 (i.e., substantively confirming, inter alia, that “no
responsive documents have ever existed”) are compliant and that no further
responses to same are warranted. Likewise, Defendant’s response to Request No.
12 (i.e., substantively stating that it “has no documents responsive to this
request, is unaware of the existence of any responsive documents or whether any
responsive documents have ever existed”) is compliant; as such, no further
response is warranted.
Evaluation/Warranty Discovery (i.e., Requests Nos. 15-29)
Request No. 15 seeks
documents relating to Defendants rules, policies or procedures since 2017
concerning the issuance of refunds to buyers or providing replacement vehicles
to buyers in the State of California under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty
Act.
Request No. 16 seeks
documents relating to Defendant’s Call Center Policies and Procedures for
escalating customer complaints relating to any defects present in their
vehicle.
Request No. 17 seeks
documents which relate to Defendant’s Call Center Policies and Procedures for
creating a Service Activity in response to customer complaints relating to any
defects present in their vehicle.
Request No. 18 seeks
all documents relating to Defendant’s policies and procedures for determining
whether a vehicle should be repurchased or replaced under the Song Beverly Act.
Request No. 19 seeks
documents relating to any flow charts used by Defendant for the purpose of
escalating customer complaints.
Request No. 20 seeks
documents relating to any flow charts used by Defendant for the purpose of
evaluating whether a vehicle qualifies for repurchase or replacement under the
Song-Beverly Act.
Request No. 21 seeks
documents evidencing Defendant’s training materials related to Defendant’s
policy regarding how to calculate a repurchase.
Request No. 22 seeks
documents relating to any policies or procedures followed by Defendant’s
Customer Relation Center to advise customers to deliver their vehicles to
Defendant’s authorized repair facilities for further diagnosis of repair
instead of offering a repurchase or replacement of the vehicle under the
Song-Beverly Act.
Request No. 23 seeks
documents relating to Defendant’s Warranty Policy and Procedures Manuals
provided to Defendant’s authorized repair facilities with respect to how to
determine whether repairs should be covered under warranty from 2017 to the
present.
Request No. 24 seeks
documents relating to Defendant’s Warranty Policy and Procedure Manuals
provided to Defendant’s authorized repair facilities with respect to whether
repairs should be covered under warranty as “goodwill” from 2017 to the
present.
Request No. 25 seeks
documents relating to Defendant’s Warranty Policy and Procedure Manuals
provided to Defendant’s authorized repair facilities with respect to repeated
repair visits for similar complaints by the consumer from 2017 to the present.
Request No. 26 seeks
documents relating to Defendant’s Warranty Policy and Procedures Manual
provided to Defendant’s authorized repair facilities on what type of repairs
require approval by Defendant in order to cover the repair under warranty from
2017 to the present.
Request No. 27 seeks
documents relating to Defendant’s Warranty Policy and Procedure Manuals
provided to Defendant’s authorized repair facilities on then length for test
drives on certain customer complaints to be covered under warranty from 2017 to
the present.
Request No. 28 seeks
documents Defendant’s Warranty Policy and Procedure Manuals provided to
Defendant’s authorized repair facilities on what type of repairs will not be
reimbursed by Defendant as warranty repairs from 2017 to the present.
Request No. 29 seeks
all documents relating to Defendant’s Warranty Policy and Procedure Manuals
provided to Defendant’s authorized repair facilities on how to handle customer
concerns that are not duplicated at the time of the repair visit from 2017 to the
present.
Again, although
Defendant raised various objections to the aforesaid requests, Defendant has
not met its burden of justifying any of them. (See above).
With respect to Requests Nos. 15, 17-22, 24, 26, 27 and 29,
Defendant represents that it “provided code compliant responses indicating it
was unable to comply with each request and that pursuant to a diligent search
and reasonable inquiry, [it] had no responsive documents,” and that “[n]o
further response[s] [are] warranted.” (Opp. Sep. Statement, 42:15-17, 48:4-6,
50:27-51:2, 54:18-20, 57:6-8, 59:26-60:1, 63:1-3, 65:13-15, 70:12-14, 72:22-24
and 77:20-22). The court believes that Defendant’s responses to Requests Nos. 15,
17-22, 24, 26, 27 and 29 (i.e., substantively confirming, inter alia, that it
has no responsive documents and “no such documents have ever existed”) are
compliant with Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.230 and that no further responses
to same are warranted.
With respect to Requests Nos. 16, 23, 25 and 28, Defendant
represents that it “provided code compliant responses indicating it was
unable to comply with each request and that pursuant to a diligent search and
reasonable inquiry, [it] had no responsive documents and that no responsive
documents have ever existed,” that, notwithstanding same, “[i]n the interest of
cooperation, [it] agreed to produce confidential and proprietary documents
which were not otherwise responsive to Plaintiff’s request as worded” and that
“[n]o further response[s] are warranted.” (Opp. Sep. Statement, 45-12:18,
63:1-7, 67:27-6 and 75:9-15). Again, the court believes that Defendant’s responses to
Requests Nos. 16, 23, 25 and 28 (i.e., substantively confirming, inter alia,
that it has no responsive documents and no responsive documents “has/have ever
existed”) are compliant with Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.230 and that no
further responses to same are warranted.
Similar Customer Complaints (i.e., Requests Nos. 30 and
31)
Request No. 30 seeks documents, in the form of a list or
compilation, of other customer complaints in Defendant’s electronically stored
information of database(s) that are substantially similar[2] to
complaints made by Plaintiff with respect to the subject vehicle in other 2022
Honda Accord vehicles.
Request No. 31 seeks documents relating to any Field Service
Action issued, or in the process of being issued, in response to complaints
experienced by Plaintiff as described in Defendant’s warranty history/summary
and within the line items of the repair orders created at Defendant’s
authorized repair facility.
Defendant objected to Request No. 30 on the basis that it
was vague, ambiguous, overly broad, unduly burdensome, harassing, sought
irrelevant information, failed to describe with reasonable particularity the
documents or categories of documents being requested, failed to define the term
“complaints made by Plaintiff” such that the request was vague, ambiguous and
called for speculation, asked for information protected by the right to
privacy, called for confidential, commercially sensitive, and proprietary or
trade secret information and asked Defendant to respond on behalf of any other
entity.
Defendant addressed its vague and ambiguous objections in
opposition. The court agrees that Plaintiff’s failure to define “complaints
made by Plaintiff” renders the request vague and ambiguous. No further response
is warranted.
With respect to Request No. 31, Defendant represents that it
“provided [a] code compliant response[] indicating it was unable to comply with
each request and that pursuant to a diligent search and reasonable inquiry,
[it] had no responsive documents,” and that “[n]o further response is
warranted.” (Opp. Sep. Statement, 86:15-19). The court believes that Defendant’s
response to Requests No. 31 (i.e., substantively confirming, inter alia,
that it has no responsive documents and “no responsive documents have ever
existed in [its] possession, custody, or control”) is compliant with Code of
Civil Procedure § 2031.230 and that no further response to same is warranted.
The motion, then, is granted
in part (i.e., as to Requests Nos. 1-6, 9-11, 13 and 14) and denied in part
(i.e., as to Requests Nos. 7, 8, 12 and 15-31). Defendant
is to provide further, Code-compliant responses within 20 days from the date of
the notice of ruling.
