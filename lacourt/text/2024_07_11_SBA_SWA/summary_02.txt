A brief English-text summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:
The Judge has granted the Defendants' Motion to Augment their Expert Witness Disclosures to add Steve Rogers as a sound expert. The Judge finds that Plaintiffs did not rely to their detriment on the Defendants' original expert witness list and that the Defendants' failure to designate Rogers as an expert was due to a reasonable mistake and excusable neglect. The Judge has also granted the Defendants' Motion in Limine No. 5 to exclude new expert witness opinions not previously disclosed by Plaintiffs' experts, limiting the testimony of Plaintiffs' experts to cost adjustments and excluding new theories of liability and damages.
