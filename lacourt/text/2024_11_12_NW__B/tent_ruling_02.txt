TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Petitioner
Yesenia E. Puente’s Petitions for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or
Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability are
GRANTED.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This
action arises from a January 24, 2022, motor vehicle collision in which Claimants
Ramona Ednita Mora Puente (“Ramona”) and Maria Guadalupe Mora Puente (“Maria”)
(collectively “Claimants”) allege Defendant Hapet Yegiazarian (“Yegiazarian”)
negligently operated their motor vehicle, colliding with the motor vehicle in
which Decedent Jose Miguel Mora (“Decedent”) was a passenger, therefore killing
Decedent. Decedent was the father of Claimants.
 
On February 25, 2022, Claimants filed an action
against Defendants A & A West Coast Distribution Inc. (“A & A”),
Yegiazarian, and Does 1 to 50 (collectively “Defendants”) alleging one cause of
action for negligence resulting in wrongful death.
 
In March 2022 Petitioner Yesenia E. Puente
(“Petitioner”)’s applications for appointment as Claimants’ guardian ad litems were
granted.
 
On June 6, 2024, the case was reassigned to the
Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys Courthouse East,
effective June 24, 2024.
 
On October 9, 2024, Petitioner filed the
instant Petitions to Confirm Minor’s Compromise of Claim or Action or
Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or a Person with a Disability on
behalf of Claimants.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Petitioner
seeks court approval for a settlement under which Ramona and Maria would each receive
$82,500 from Defendants.
 
Legal
Standard
 
An enforceable settlement of a minor’s or
incompetent’s claim can only be consummated with court approval. (Cal. Prob.
Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Cal. Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) For this
purpose, a petition for approval must be presented to the court and until it is
granted, there is no final settlement. (Scruton v. Korean Air Lines Co.
(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1596, 1603-1606.) Any settlement agreement therefore is
voidable by the minor’s guardian ad litem. (Ibid. at 1606.) 
 
Prob. Code § 3600, et seq., governs how the
settlement proceeds are to be paid. Pursuant to § 3601, the order shall approve
payment of reasonable expenses from the settlement as follows: 
 
The court making the order or giving the
judgment referred to in Section 3600, as a part thereof, shall make a further
order authorizing and directing that such reasonable expenses (medical or
otherwise and including reimbursement to a parent, guardian, or conservator),
costs, and attorney’s fees, as the court shall approve and allow therein, shall
be paid from the money or other property to be paid or delivered for the
benefit of the minor or incompetent person. (Prob. Code § 3601(a).) 
 
In cases pursuant to § 3601, “unless the court
has approved the fee agreement in advance, the court must use a reasonable fee
standard when approving and allowing the amount of attorney’s fees payable from
money or property paid or to be paid for the benefit of a minor or a person
with a disability.” (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 7.955(a)(1).) In doing so, “[t]he
court must give consideration to the terms of any representation agreement made
between the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a
disability and must evaluate the agreement based on the facts and circumstances
existing at the time the agreement was made, except where the attorney and the
representative of the minor or person with a disability contemplated that the
attorney's fee would be affected by later events.” (CRC Rule 7.955(a)(2).)
 
Discussion
 
Petitioner
seeks court approval for a settlement under which Ramona and Maria would each
receive $82,500 from Defendants. For each Claimant, $20,625.00 will be deducted
for attorney’s fees and $1,434.79 for costs. Therefore, the proposed net
settlement amount for Ramona and Maria is $60,440.21 each, for a total of
$120,880.42 between the two.
 
Both
Petitions set forth information that bear upon the reasonableness of the
compromise pursuant to CRC Rule 7.950. (See MC-350s Attachments 8 and
11b(6).) Additionally, attorney’s fees represent 25% of the total settlement
agreement. (MC-350s Attachments 13a [Veliz declaration].) Claimants’ counsel
provides their retainer agreement as Attachments 17a. Counsel also provides
costs memorandums as Attachments 13b.
 
Claimants’
settlement amounts are part of a $750,000 policy limit global settlement to all
plaintiffs, which includes Decedent’s three other adult children, other
passenger Robert Rivas Sr., and Rivas Sr.’s child, Robert Rivas Jr. (MC-350s
Attachments 17e.) The apportionment of settlement is appropriate given the
injuries suffered by each party.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS
both petitions to confirm minor’s compromise.
