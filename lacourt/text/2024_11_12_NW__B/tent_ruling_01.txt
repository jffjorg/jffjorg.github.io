Re:                         21STCV11343 Carlos Burgos vs Arthur M.
Danielian

 

 
Plaintiff Carlos
Burgos’s Request for Default Judgment
 
Defendant: Arthur M. Danielian
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff Carlos Burgos’s request for
default judgment is GRANTED.
            
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from a June 15, 2020,
motor vehicle accident in which Plaintiff Carlos Burgos (“Plaintiff”) alleges
Defendants Arthur M. Daniellian (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 100 (collectively
“Defendants”), negligently operating their motor vehicle, struck Plaintiff, a
pedestrian, and caused Plaintiff to sustain serious injuries.
 
On March 24, 2021, Plaintiff filed a
complaint against Defendants alleging two causes of action for: (1) motor
vehicle negligence; and (2) general negligence.
 
On October 27, 2023, default was entered
against Defendant.
 
On June 5, 2024, the case was reassigned
to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East,
effective June 24, 2024.
 
On September 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request
for default judgment against Defendant which was denied for deficiencies.
 
On October 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
supplemental declaration to correct these deficiencies. The Court now considers
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment in conjunction with this declaration.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Cal. Code of Civil Procedure section 585
permits entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond
or appear. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the
default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief
summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support
of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a
memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration of nonmilitary status;
(6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom
judgment is not sought or an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579,
supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary;
and (9) a request for attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement
of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1800.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendant
failed to timely respond or appear. Plaintiff’s default packet meets all
statutory requirements under CCP § 585.
 
However, the
Court declines to award punitive damages sought in the amount of $50,000. (See
Mamanne Decl. Exh. 1 [Statement of Damages].) Punitive damages are presumably
requested on the grounds that, after the initial collision and upon Plaintiff
exiting his vehicle, Defendant accelerated his own vehicle, striking Plaintiff’s
person and fleeing the scene. 
 
The purpose
of punitive damages “is to punish wrongdoing and thereby to protect [the
public] from future misconduct, either by the same defendant or other potential
wrongdoers.” (Adams v. Murakami (1991) 54 Cal.3d 105, 110.) To award
punitive damages upon default, plaintiff must submit evidence of defendant’s
financial condition showing that “in light of the defendant’s wealth and
gravity of the particular act, [punitive damages do not] exceed the level
necessary to punish and deter.” (Neal v. Farmers Ins Exchange (1978) 21
Cal.3d 910, 928.) Plaintiff failed to submit evidence of Defendant’s financial
condition. Therefore, Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages is denied.
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
request for default judgment against Defendant Alexander M. Danielian is
GRANTED in the reduced amount of $251,142.08.
