And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the petitions filed by Yesenia E. Puente, the guardian ad litem for Claimants Ramona and Maria, seeking court approval for a settlement under which each Claimant would receive $82,500 from the defendants. The settlement amount is part of a global settlement of $750,000 to all plaintiffs, including Decedent's three other adult children, and other passengers. The judge has also approved the payment of reasonable expenses, costs, and attorney's fees from the settlement proceeds. The settlement is deemed reasonable and the court finds that the attorney's fees represent 25% of the total settlement agreement.
