RULING: The hearing on the motion will be
continued to 9/13/24.    
 
This action arises out of a dispute between Plaintiffs
Alicia and Robert Brown (Plaintiffs) and Defendants Middleton Investments, Inc.
dba Middleton Construction; Christopher Champion and Teri King (Defendants)
regarding alleged construction defects involving Plaintiffs residence located
at 28852 Iron Village Drive, Valencia, California 91354 (the Property).  Plaintiffs hired Defendants to repair
interior stairs and remodel the master bathroom.  Plaintiffs terminated Defendants before they
completed the work and retained a new contractor to allegedly repair and/or
replace the work that Defendants performed on the Property.  
 
On 4/12/23, Plaintiffs filed this action against
Defendants for: (1) Breach of Oral Contract; (2) Breach of Covenant of Good
Faith and Fair Dealing; (3) Negligence; (4) Negligence Per Se; (5) Breach of
Express and Implied Warranties; Recovery on Contractor’s License Bond (against
Hudson Insurance); and (7) Disgorgement. 
On 6/23/23, Defendants answered the complaint.
 
On 7/13/23, Defendants electronically served Plaintiffs
with written discovery making responses due on or before 8/13/23.  (Rutherford Decl., Ex.A).  Pursuant to Plaintiffs’ requests for
extensions, responses were due on 9/22/23. 
On 9/22/23, Plaintiffs served unverified responses to the
discovery.  (Rutherford Decl.,
Ex.B).  Dissatisfied with the unverified
responses and objections contained therein, Defendants sent a meet and confer
letter on 10/3/23 which outlined the deficiencies in certain of Plaintiffs’ discovery
responses.  (Rutherford Decl. ¶10,
Ex.C).  
 
Again, Plaintiffs requested extensions of time to further
respond.  During the meet and confer
process, the parties agreed to a mutual open-ended extension regarding pending
discovery and associated deadlines on motions to compel so the parties could
engage in informal settlement discussions. 
(Rutherford Decl., Ex.D).  
 
On 12/7/23, it became clear that the case would not be
resolved.  Therefore, Defendants, again,
requested that Plaintiffs supplement their responses to the subject discovery
requests by 12/20/23 and confirmed that motions to compel further responses
were due 1/20/24.  (Rutherford Decl.,
Ex.E).  Plaintiffs failed to serve
further responses.  (Rutherford Decl.).
 
Therefore, on 1/19/24, Defendants filed and served motions
seeking orders compelling further responses from Plaintiffs to certain of Defendants’
Request for Production of Documents, Set 1; Form Interrogatories, Set 1,
Special Interrogatories, Set 1 and Request for Admissions, Set 1.  Additionally, in each motion, Defendants
requested an award of monetary sanctions against Plaintiffs and their counsel.  
 
The hearing on the first, unopposed, motion relating to
document requests went forward on 7/30/24 as scheduled.  (See 7/30/24 Minute Order).  The day before the hearing, Plaintiffs’
counsel, Todd Wolfe, filed a declaration indicating that the failure to supplement
the discovery responses and/or respond to the motion was due to his health
issues and a calendaring error regarding the hearing dates.  (See Wolfe Decl. filed 7/29/24).  In his declaration attorney Wolfe also
indicated that he had discussed with Defendants’ counsel the possibility of
continuing the hearing on the 7/30/24 motion and the two motions scheduled for
8/9/24 (the instant motion) and 8/12/24 (motion re Special Interrogatories) to
9/13/24, the hearing date on the motion regarding Request for Admissions.  (Wolfe Decl. ¶¶16-17).  While Defendants’ counsel could not agree to
continue the 7/30/24 hearing, he was willing to discuss continuing the hearings
on the motions scheduled for 8/9/24 and 8/12/24.  Id. 
 
Since the 8/9/24 and 8/12/24 hearings still appeared on
the Court’s 8/9/24 and 8/12/24 calendars and no other documents relating to those
motions had been filed, court staff called Defendants’ counsel to inquire
whether the 8/9/24 and 8/12/24 hearings would be proceeding as scheduled.  Defendants’ attorney, Howard Weber, indicated
that Defendants’ had agreed to continue the hearings to 9/13/24 but did not
agree to continue the briefing schedule on the motions and the motions would
not be proceeding on 8/9/24 and 8/12/24. 

 
Based on the foregoing, the hearing on the instant motion
and the hearing on the Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set 1, filed on 1/19/24 and scheduled for hearing on 8/12/24, are
continued to 9/13/24.
