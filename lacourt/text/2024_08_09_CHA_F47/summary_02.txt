The Judge has placed off calendar a motion filed by attorney Dennis Russell, seeking to relieve himself as counsel for Plaintiffs Nicole A. Parke, E.O.A. Global Holdings, LLC, and E.O.A. Management Group, LLC. The motion was originally scheduled for hearing on December 4, 2024, but was rescheduled to August 9, 2024. However, a proof of service for the motion and a notice of the new hearing date have not been filed, and no oppositions or responses have been filed to cure the defect in notice. As a result, the motion is being placed off calendar.
