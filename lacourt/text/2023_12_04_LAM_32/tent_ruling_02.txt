     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendants’ motion for attorneys’ fees 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On August 16, 2023, Plaintiff Eugene
Popok filed this action against Defendants Mikhail Mekk and Mission Organic
Center Inc., asserting causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2) breach
of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and (3) fraud. 
            Plaintiff alleges that the parties
entered into a settlement agreement in August 2019. (Compl. ¶ 8, Ex. 1.) Defendants
allegedly breached the agreement’s confidentiality provision by disclosing the
settlement without Plaintiff’s consent during a trial of a previous case
between the parties (LC107612). (Id., ¶ 15.) The breach allegedly
contributed to Defendants’ victory in the prior trial and cost Plaintiff the
opportunity to sell his interest in Mission Organic Center Inc. (MOC) to his
bail bondsman, Kamenetsky, for $750,000. (Id., ¶¶ 16-17.) Plaintiff
also allegedly lost attorneys’ fees and costs paid in the appeal of case
LC107612 as a result of the breach. (Id., ¶ 18.) 
            On October 3, 2023, Defendants filed
an anti-SLAPP motion, set for hearing on October 27, 2023. The motion was taken
off calendar after Defendants failed to appear on October 27. Defendants
refiled their anti-SLAPP motion on October 27, and the Court granted the motion
on December 1, 2023. 
            On October 30, 2023, Defendants
filed the instant motion to recover attorneys’ fees associated with the
anti-SLAPP motion. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition.   
LEGAL STANDARD
“[A] prevailing defendant on a special
motion to strike shall be entitled to recover that defendant’s attorney’s fees
and costs.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16(c)(1).)
DISCUSSION
            Defense counsel’s hourly rate is
$450. (Mangarelli Decl. ¶ 14.) The Court finds this to be reasonable. Defense
counsel claims to have spent 22.3 hours associated with the anti-SLAPP motion
and 4 hours for this motion. (Id., ¶¶ 15-16.) The Court finds theses
hours to be reasonable. number of hours for both motions is 18 hours.  Defendants are also entitled to costs of
$526.26. (Id., ¶ 19, Ex. C.) Therefore, the total recoverable amount is
$10,561.26.  ($10,035.00 and $526.26.)
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ motion for attorneys’
fees is GRANTED in the amount of $10,561.26.
