            v.
 
VOLKSWAGEN GROUP OF
  AMERICA, INC.; et al., 
                        Defendants.
  


 
  Case No.:  23STCV19174
  Hearing Date:  December 4, 2023
 
     [Tentative] order RE:
defendants’ demurrer to PLAINTIFF’S complaint
  




 


 



BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff ROXANA YAGHOOBIAN initiated
this lemon law action on August 11, 2023. 
 The operative Complaint alleges Song-Beverly
violations against Defendants VOLKSWAGEN GROUP OF AMERICA, INC. (VWGOA) and negligent
repair against Defendant VOLKSWAGEN SANTA MONICA (VWSM).   
            On October 18, 2023, Defendants
filed their demurrers to the Complaint. Defendants argue that the negligent repair
claim, cause of action five, is barred by the economic loss rule. 
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering
demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water
and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.) In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper
judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a).) A demurrer tests
the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the
face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the
complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of
action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th
at 747.) A complaint will survive demurrer if it sufficiently apprises the
defendant of the issues, and specificity is not required where discovery will
clarify the ambiguities. (See Ludgate Ins. Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp.
(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 592, 608.) All reasonable inferences are drawn in favor
of the complaint. (Kruss v. Booth (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 699, 713.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to strike,
the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the party who
filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the motion to
strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be reached
through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.) The Court notes
that Defendant has complied with the meet and confer requirement.

DISCUSSION
I. Economic Loss Rule
            Economic loss consists of “damages
for inadequate value, costs of repair and replacement of the defective product
or consequent loss of profits—without any claim of personal injury or damages
to other property.” (Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp. (2004)
34 Cal.4th 979, 988.) The economic loss rule requires a purchaser to recover in
contract for purely economic loss due to disappointed expectations, unless the
purchaser “can demonstrate harm above and beyond a broken contractual promise,”
such as some form of personal injury or damage to property other than the
defective product itself. (Ibid.) 
            However, economic losses arising
from a contract of sale are distinct from economic losses arising from
negligent performance of services. (See North American Chemical Co. v.
Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 764, 777.) The economic loss rule does
not apply “when the commercial relationship of the parties does not involve the
sale of goods or products, nor the rules developed under the law merchant and
the Uniform Commercial Code, but rather relates only to the performance of
services.” (Id. at pp. 780-81.) Because “every person is responsible for
the injuries caused by his or her lack of ordinary care . . . [there is] no
reason to distinguish between different types of damage.” (Id. at p.
783.) Civil Code section 1714 “does not distinguish among injuries to
one's person, one's property or one's financial interests.” (Ibid.) “Recovery
for injury to one's economic interests, where it is the foreseeable result of
another's want of ordinary care, should not be foreclosed simply because it is
the only injury that occurs.” (Ibid.) Therefore, Plaintiff’s negligent
repair claim against Bravo is not barred by the economic loss rule. 
            The elements of negligence have
otherwise been adequately alleged, and ambiguities may be resolved in discovery.
Plaintiff is not required to know at this stage precisely how VWSM negligently repaired
the vehicle. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendants’ demurrers are OVERRULED.
  Defendants to file an answer within 20
days.
