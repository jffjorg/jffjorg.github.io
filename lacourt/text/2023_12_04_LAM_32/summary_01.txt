And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Roxana Yaghoobian, initiated a lemon law action on August 11, 2023, alleging Song-Beverly violations against Volkswagen Group of America, Inc., and negligent repair against Volkswagen Santa Monica. The defendants argue that the negligent repair claim is barred by the economic loss rule. The Judge notes that the defendants complied with the meet and confer requirement.

The Judge rules that the economic loss rule does not apply to the negligent repair claim, as it arises from a contract of services rather than a contract of sale. The Judge also notes that the plaintiff has adequately alleged the elements of negligence and that ambiguities may be resolved in discovery.

The Judge overrules the defendants' demurrers and orders them to file an answer within 20 days.
