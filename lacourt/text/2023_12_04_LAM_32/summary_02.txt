Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants, granting their motion for attorneys' fees associated with the anti-SLAPP motion. The defendants are entitled to recover $10,561.26 in attorneys' fees and costs, based on the reasonable hourly rate of $450 per hour for 18 hours of work. The judge finds the hours claimed by defense counsel to be reasonable and the costs of $526.26 to be also reasonable. The defendants' anti-SLAPP motion was granted on December 1, 2023, and the defendants' motion for attorneys' fees was filed on October 30, 2023. The plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the motion. The judge's ruling is based on California Civil Procedure Code § 425.16(c)(1), which provides that a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover attorney's fees and costs.
