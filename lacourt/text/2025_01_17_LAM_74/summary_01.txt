And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by Defendant Madeline Ryan to the entire complaint and a motion to strike certain parts of the complaint. The demurrer argues that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible. The Court overrules the demurrer to the First Cause of Action, which alleges a violation of the Constitutional Right to Reproductive Freedom, as the Reproductive Privacy Act allows a party to bring a civil action against a non-state actor. The Court sustains the demurrer to the Second Cause of Action, which alleges a violation of Civil Code section 1708.5.6, with leave to amend, as the complaint fails to state facts supporting the elements of the cause of action and fails to establish if an embryo was ever implanted. The Court overrules the demurrer to the Third Cause of Action, which requests permanent injunctive relief, as the complaint alleges that Walker is attempting to use the fertilized eggs and the Court has jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief. The Court sustains the demurrer to the Fourth Cause of Action, which requests declaratory relief, with leave to amend, as the complaint fails to establish a contract between the parties. The Court denies the Motion to Strike except for the prayer for attorney's fees, for which the Court gives the Plaintiff leave to amend.
