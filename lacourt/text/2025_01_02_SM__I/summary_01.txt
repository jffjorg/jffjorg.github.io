And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to re-open discovery, which would allow the defendant to conduct an independent medical examination, designate experts, and take eight depositions of witnesses, including some of the plaintiff's medical providers. The defendant claims that more time is needed to complete discovery, but the judge believes that the problem is the timeliness of the request, rather than the propriety of the discovery itself. The judge notes that the defendant was fully aware of being sued but did not take discovery or retain new counsel for a long time, and that the defendant's new lawyer, Mr. Shirley, did not take any action for months. The judge also notes that the trial is coming up quickly and that granting the motion would prejudice the plaintiff, who has waited for four years to have her day in court. The judge concludes that the defendant has not been diligent in taking discovery and that the motion is denied.
