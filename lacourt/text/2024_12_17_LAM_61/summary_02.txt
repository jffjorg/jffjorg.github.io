And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the City of Beverly Hills' motion to compel the disclosure of peace officer personnel records of plaintiff Daryl Glover from the Los Angeles Police Department. The motion was filed to use the records as evidence in the city's defense against Glover's employment discrimination claims. The judge found that good cause supported the disclosure of the records, as they are relevant to the employment claims and Glover has alleged that his experience at the LAPD is grounds for his qualifications to hold a position with the city. The judge also noted that the LAPD does not oppose the production of the records and has agreed to provide them. The court will conduct an in camera inspection to exclude irrelevant information and will order discoverable information to be released pursuant to a protective order.
