And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a writ of attachment against the defendant, Eric Brooks, and the JHAE Brooks Family Trust. The motion was based on a promissory note executed by Brooks on December 21, 2022, which stated that he would repay a sum of $306,749.29 by December 31, 2026, with annual interest payments. However, the judge found that the plaintiff had not demonstrated entitlement to the attachment order. The judge noted that the plaintiff's declaration regarding the authenticity of the promissory note was made without foundation, and that the defendant's denial of executing the note was corroborated by an expert declaration. Additionally, the judge found that the motion did not address the requirements for issuance of a writ of attachment against a natural person, and that the relief sought was overbroad. Therefore, the motion was denied.
