And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the petition for approval of payment rights submitted by J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC (Petitioner) on behalf of Jacob Elijah Husser (Payee). The Petitioner seeks to approve the transfer of a structured settlement payment right from Husser to the Petitioner. To approve the transfer, the court must find that certain statutory provisions are met, including that the transfer is in the best interest of the payee, taking into account the welfare and support of the payee's dependents. The court must also find that the payee has been advised to seek independent professional advice regarding the transfer and has either received that advice or knowingly waived, in writing, the opportunity to receive the advice. The court must also find that the transfer does not contravene any applicable statute or the order of any court or other government authority. In this case, the court finds that the transfer is fair and reasonable in light of Husser's best interest, and that he has been advised to seek independent counsel and has waived that right. The required disclosure form has been provided, and the payee understands the terms of the transfer.
