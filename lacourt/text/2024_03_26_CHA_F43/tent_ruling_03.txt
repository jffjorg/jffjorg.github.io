SUMMARY OF
ACTION
On July 13,
2023, Plaintiff Crestmark (Plaintiff) filed an Application for Entry of
Judgment on Sister State Judgment based on a Michigan Judgment against
Defendant Richard Stephen Edmundson (Defendant) in the amount of $257,140.23,
plus interest of $13,750.00. Plaintiff served Defendant via substitute service
on July 23, 2023, and filed the proof of service on August 4, 2023.
 
In his motion
filed on August 11, 2023, Defendant argues that the sister state judgment may
not have been served on him, that the summons may not have resulted in actual
notice to Defendant, and that the substitute service was deficient.
 
In Plaintiff’s
opposition, Plaintiff indicates that it filed an amended proof of service on
August 18, 2023, with an affidavit of due diligence after realizing that this
was missing from the initial proof of service. Plaintiff has also personally
served Defendant with the sister state judgment documents on September 24,
2023, and November 7, 2023. (See Opposition, Rudman Decl., Exs. 9 and 10.)
 
Plaintiff
argues that the initial substitute service was proper pursuant to CCP §
415.20(b). Plaintiff further argues that any alleged defect was cured by actual
notice when Defendant was personally served on September 24, 2023, and November
7, 2023. (CCP § 473.5(c); see Ellard v. Conway (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th
540, 544.) Because Plaintiff has personally served Defendant, there is no doubt
that service has been completed on Defendant.
 
Plaintiff has
also requested attorney fees as part of its opposition. The Court declines to
award any attorney fees at this time.
 
Defendant’s
motion to vacate sister state judgment is denied.
 
Moving party to
give notice.
