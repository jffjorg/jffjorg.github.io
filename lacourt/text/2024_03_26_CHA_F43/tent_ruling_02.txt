Case #22CHCV00236,
Monocent Inc., vs. Mina Kateb
Trial Date: 6-17-24
 
MOTION TO COMPEL MINA KATEB’S DEPOSITION
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiff
Monocent and Cross-Defendants Shervin Taheri, Hooman Sahrapeyma, and Monocent,
Inc.
RESPONDING
PARTY: Defendant Mina Kateb
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED
Defendants
request that the Court compel Mina Kateb to appear at a deposition in order to
complete her deposition that was started on June 12, 2023
 
RULING: Motion
is deemed moot
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION
Cross-Defendants
filed this motion after the parties could not agree on a date for a
continuation of Kateb’s June 12, 2023, deposition. Cross-Defendants represent
that Kateb refused to appear for the continuation of the deposition until
Cross-Defendants acquiesced to her demands regarding certain financial and
trade secret information. Cross-Defendants filed their motion on August 22,
2023. Cross-Defendants have requested sanctions in the amount of $8,875 for
having to bring the motion.
 
On December 11,
2023, Kateb filed an opposition to Cross-Defendants’ motion. In her opposition,
Kateb represents that she appeared for and completed the continued deposition
on November 3, 2023. This, she argues, means that Cross-Defendants’ motion is
now moot. Kateb argues that the motion should have been denied regardless
because it was not accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. Kateb also
argues that the exhibits attached to Cross-Defendants’ motion are not
authenticated.
 
No reply has
been filed as of March 21, 2023. Based on a court order continuing the original
hearing date from December 22, 2023, to the current date, opposition and reply
were due on the original hearing date.
 
Because it
appears to the Court that the motion is moot, the parties should argue at the
hearing whether sanctions are still warranted.
