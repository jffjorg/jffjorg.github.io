And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is regarding a motion to compel Mina Kateb's deposition, filed by the plaintiff Monocent Inc. and cross-defendants Shervin Taheri, Hooman Sahrapeyma, and Monocent Inc. The motion was filed after the parties could not agree on a date for the continuation of Kateb's deposition, which was started on June 12, 2023. The defendants requested sanctions in the amount of $8,875 for having to bring the motion. Kateb filed an opposition to the motion, arguing that she completed the deposition on November 3, 2023, making the motion moot. The court finds that the motion is indeed moot, and orders the parties to argue at the hearing whether sanctions are still warranted.
