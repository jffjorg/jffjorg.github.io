And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

On March 26, 2024, Judge [Judge's Name] issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jovan Brumfield vs. Franc Robbins, Case Number 23CHCV00280. The case involves a motion by Rhona S. Kauffman, attorney for defendant Franc Robbins, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed with the required forms and accompanied by a declaration stating that there has been a breakdown of attorney-client communication, making it impossible for the attorney to adequately represent the client. The judge granted the motion, citing California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362 and People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406, which states that an attorney's request for withdrawal should be granted absent a showing of resulting prejudice. The judge held that there was no showing of prejudice and that the motion complied with the required forms and rules. The moving party is ordered to give notice of the ruling.
