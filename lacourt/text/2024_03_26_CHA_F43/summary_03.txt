And here is a summary in English text:

In this tentative ruling, the Judge denies the Defendant's motion to vacate a sister state judgment in the amount of $257,140.23, plus interest of $13,750.00. The Defendant argued that the sister state judgment may not have been served on him, that the summons may not have resulted in actual notice, and that the substitute service was deficient. The Plaintiff, however, has provided evidence of personal service on the Defendant on September 24, 2023, and November 7, 2023, which the Judge finds sufficient to complete service. The Judge also declines to award attorney fees to the Plaintiff at this time.
