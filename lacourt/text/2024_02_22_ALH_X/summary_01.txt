And here is a summary in English text:

Judge Joel L. Lofton has issued a tentative ruling in the case Pref Pasadena Collection, LLC v. Pasadena Collection West Property Owners' Association. The case is about a dispute over discovery responses, and the defendant is seeking relief from waiving its objections to those responses. The defendant claims that it served the discovery requests via email on December 7, 2023, but its counsel belatedly found the email on January 10, 2024. The defendant then provided responses after discovering the missed email. The judge has granted the defendant's motion for relief from waiver of objections, noting that the circumstances surrounding the defendant's knowledge of the discovery requests and its attempts to provide two separate sets of responses justify relief. The judge has also ordered the moving party to give notice.
