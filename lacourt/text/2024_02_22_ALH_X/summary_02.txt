And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the hearing on Defendant Jason Scott Arrow's claim of exemption is continued for 30 days. The levying officer is ordered to file the claim of exemption with the court prior to the continued hearing date. The judge finds that the statutory procedures require that the claim of exemption be filed with the court, and since no copy of the claim of exemption appears to be in the court's record, the hearing is continued. The judge also finds good cause to continue the motion, as provided by Code of Civil Procedure section 703.570, subdivision (a).
