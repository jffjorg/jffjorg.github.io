Case No. 23STCV29942 (January 12, 2024)
The Court grants judicial review pursuant California
Evidence Code section 452(d). 
Legal
Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 128,
subdivision (a)(5) authorizes the Court “[t]o control in furtherance of
justice, the conduct of its ministerial officers, and of all other persons in
any manner connected with a judicial proceeding before it, in every matter
pertaining thereto.”
This authority necessarily includes
disqualifying an attorney. (Metro-Goldwyn
Mayer, Inc. v. Tracinda Corp. (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1832, 1837–1838.) 
The Court of Appeal has stated:
 
The issue of
disqualification ultimately involves a conflict between the clients' right to
counsel of their choice and the need to maintain ethical standards of
professional responsibility. The
paramount concern, though, must be the preservation of public trust in the
scrupulous administration of justice and the integrity of the bar. The
recognized and important right to counsel of one's choosing must yield to
considerations of ethics that run to the very integrity of our judicial
process.
(Id. at p. 1838, citation marks omitted.)

“Whether an attorney should be
disqualified is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.”
(Henriksen v. Great Am. Sav. & Loan
(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 109, 113.) “In exercising that discretion, the trial
court is required to make a reasoned judgment which complies with the legal
principles and policies applicable to the issue at hand.” (Ibid.) 
Discussion
            Plaintiff Jefferson filed the motion
to disqualify the Afifi Law Group, Faryan Andrew Afifi, and Niki Kalantari (the
“Afifi Parties”) on the basis that the Afifi Parties’ were engaging in a
concurrent representation for and against Jefferson in simultaneous legal
proceedings. Here, Afifi Law Group, Fayran Andrew Afifi and Niki Kalantari withdrew
as counsel prior to the hearing of this motion on February 27, 2024.
Nevertheless, Plaintiff Jefferson requests that the Court still enter an Order
granting the motion because the Afifi Parties refused to withdraw during the
meet an confer which caused Plaintiff Jefferson to incur the fees in filing
this motion.
Substantial
Relationship
Code
of Civil Procedure section 128, subdivision (a), clause (5) authorizes the
court to control the conduct of its ministerial officers and all other persons
in any manner connected with a judicial proceeding before it in furtherance of
justice, including disqualifying attorneys. 
“The issue of disqualification ‘ultimately involves a conflict between
the clients’ right to counsel of their choice and the need to maintain ethical
standards of professional responsibility. The paramount concern, though,
must be the preservation of public trust in the scrupulous administration of
justice and the integrity of the bar. The recognized and important right to
counsel of one’s choosing must yield to considerations of ethics that run to
the very integrity of our judicial process.’ ([citation] italics added.)”  (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., supra, 36
Cal.App.4th at p.1837, [emphasis in original].)
In a
successive representation situation, “when an attorney is engaged to represent
the interests of a party that are adverse to a former client of the
attorney’s,” as potentially here, the test “is whether there is a ‘substantial
relationship’ between the subjects of the former and current
representations.”  (Id. at p.1839.)
Three
factors that should be considered in determining whether a substantial
relationship exists are: “(1) factual similarities between the two
representations, (2) similarities in legal issues, and (3) the nature and
extent of the attorney’s involvement with the case and whether he was in a
position to learn of the client’s policy or strategy.”  (Adams v. Aerojet-General Corp. (2001)
86 Cal.App.4th 1324, 1332.)
Regarding
burdens, a substantial relationship gives rise to a presumption that the
attorney possesses confidential information. 
(Id. at p.1331.)  “[I]in
light of the paramount importance of maintaining the inviolability of client
confidences, where a substantial relationship between the former firm’s
representation of the client and the current lawsuit has been shown …, the
attorney whose disqualification is sought should carry the burden of proving
that he had no exposure to confidential information relevant to the current
action while he was a member of the former firm. (See ABA Model Rules Prof.
Conduct, rule 1.9, com. [7].) That burden requires an affirmative showing and
is not satisfied by a cursory denial.”  (Id.
at 1340-1341.)
Whether
an attorney should be disqualified is a matter addressed to the trial court’s
sound discretion.  (Henriksen v. Great
American Savings & Loan (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 109, 113; Adams, supra,
86 Cal.App.4th at p.1340, [“The trial court’s discretion is broad. It may not
only consider the declarations and other evidence before it, but may apply
‘inferences, deductions or working presumptions that reasonably may be made
about the way in which lawyers work together.’ (ABA Model Rules Prof. Conduct,
rule 1.9, com. [6].)”].)
             Here, as evidentiary support, Moving Plaintiff
submits the declarations of Plaintiff’s counsel Reed Alijian and the
Plaintiff’s managing director, Ara Gulesserian, Compendium of Exhibits, and the
Request for Judicial Notice.  
Of the
admissible and relevant information before the Court, the evidence is
sufficient to support the instant motion. The motion is made on the grounds
that the Afifi Parties have a conflict of interest that has not been waived as
they are currently counsel of record on behalf of Jefferson in Case Nos.
23STRO08464, 23STRO08465, 23STRO08466, and 23STRO08467 (the “STRO Actions”)
and, simultaneously, they are counsel of record adverse to Jefferson in this action.
The Afifi Parties do not contend they have obtained a written conflict waiver
and Jefferson has not signed such a conflict waiver. 
The evidence shows that (1) on December 18, 2023,
the Afifi Parties filed an opposition to the Plaintiffs’ Ex Parte application,
appearing adverse to Jefferson, and asked that the Court deny Jefferson’s
requested relief (Ex. 4.), and (2) on December 20,
2023, two days after the Afifi Parties filed Brown’s opposition adverse to
Jefferson’s Ex Parte application, the Afifi Parties filed four civil actions on
behalf of Jefferson in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles,
Case Nos. 23STRO08464, 23STRO08465, 23STRO08466, and 23STRO08467. (RJN, Exs.
8-11.) All of which appear related to the instant action in which Plaintiffs
claim that a previous employee, Scott Brown embezzled and converted Plaintiffs
assets. (FAC ¶ 1.) Under these facts, Plaintiff Jefferson has decomstrated a substantial relationship between the relationships. 
Waiver
“[A]ttorney
disqualification can be impliedly waived by failing to bring the motion in a
timely manner.”  (Liberty National
Enterprises, L.P. v. Chicago Title Ins. Co. (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th
839, 844.)  However, “the delay has to be
extreme or unreasonable before it operates as a waiver.”  (Id. at p.845.)  “It has also been held that the prejudice to
the opponent must be extreme.”  (Ibid.)
As to
delay, “[t]he stage of litigation at which the disqualification motion is made
is one such consideration.”  (Id.
at p.846.)  As “[i]t stands to reason
that the later the motion is made, the more difficult it is to replace counsel.”  (Id. at p.847.)  “Delay is significant not only from the
perspective of prejudice to the nonmoving party, it is also an indication that
the alleged breach of confidentiality was not seen as serious or substantial by
the moving party.”  (Ibid.)  
As to
prejudice, “[a]mong all the factors to be taken into account in a motion for
disqualification, the interest and right of the nonmoving client to the lawyer
of its choice is certainly one. This interest must of course yield to the
moving party's interest when there is an actual conflict or breach of
confidentiality. But when, as here, the delay was so unreasonable as to amount
to an implied waiver, the interests of the nonmoving client should certainly be
taken into account.”  (Id. at
p.848.)
Plaintiff
Jefferson did not unreasonably delay in bringing this motion because it filed
the instant motion on January 19, 2024, which was approximately a month after
the Afifi Parties began their adverse representation. Moreover, on December 28,
2023, Plaintiffs’ counsel sent an email to Faryan Andrew Afifi to meet and
confer regarding a motion to disqualify the Afifi Parties. (Alijian Decl. ¶ 3.)
Therefore, Plaintiff did not waive its rights. 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff Jefferson’s motion to disqualify the Afifi Parties
from this case is GRANTED.
The Moving Party is
ordered to give notice and file proof of service of such.
