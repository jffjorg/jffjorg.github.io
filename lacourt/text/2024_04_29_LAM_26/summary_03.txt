And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Plaintiff Jefferson's motion to disqualify Afifi Law Group, Faryan Andrew Afifi, and Niki Kalantari as counsel. The Court finds that the Afifi Parties have a conflict of interest, having represented Jefferson in other cases and being adverse to Jefferson in this case. The Court also finds that Jefferson did not unreasonably delay in bringing the motion. The Court orders the Afifi Parties to give notice and file proof of service of the disqualification.
