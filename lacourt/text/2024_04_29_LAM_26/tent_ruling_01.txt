  Case Number:  19STCV28356    Hearing Date:   April 29, 2024    Dept:  26 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 26        CREDITCARD    DATA SERVICES, INC.,                         Plaintiff,             v.   HYUNMOK CHO, et al.                         Defendants.       Case No.:  19STCV28356     Hearing Date:  April 11, 2024      [TENTATIVE]    order RE: DEFENDANT HYUNKMOK CHO’S MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES           Procedural  Background              On August 9, 2019, Plaintiff Creditcard Data  Services, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants Hyunmok Cho  aka Hank Cho (“Defendant”) and DOES 1 through 50, inclusive, alleging causes of  action for: (1) breach of written contract; and (2) statutory misappropriation  of trade secrets. The Complaint arises from the alleged breach of the  Confidentiality and Non-Compete Agreement (the “Agreement”), entered into  between Plaintiff and Defendant. (Complaint, ¶ 11-12; Exh. A.) The Agreement  states, in part, that “[t]he prevailing party in any action to enforce this  Agreement shall be reimbursed by the other party for its reasonable attorneys’  fees and all costs incurred in connection with such enforcement.” (Complaint;  Exh. A at ¶ 8.)   On January 31, 2023, jury trial commenced.  On February 7, 2023, the jury returned a special verdict and found that  Defendant was not liable for breach of contract or misappropriation of trade  secrets. (02/07/23 Minute Order.) The Court entered Judgment on aSpecial  Verdict on May 18, 2023. The Court’s judgment provides that Plaintiff shall  recover nothing by reason of their Complaint against Defendant, and Defendant  shall recover costs and disbursements per a memorandum of costs and reasonable  attorney fees per noticed motion. Notice of entry of judgment was served on all  parties on May 18, 2023. (05/18/23 Minute Order.)  On July 17, 2023, after taking the matter  under submission, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion for a new trial.  (07/17/23 Minute Order.) The Clerk mailed notice of the Court’s ruling to the  parties on July 17, 2023.  On August 4, 2023, Plaintiff filed a  Notice of Appeal, which indicated that Plaintiff was appealing the Court’s May  18, 2023, entry of judgment in this matter.  On September 26, 2023, Defendant filed and  served the instant Motion for Attorneys’ Fees. Defendant requests attorneys’  fees in the amount of $316,580.00.[1]  On January 26, 2024, Brad Lee filed a  Notice of Errata and declaration in support thereof stating that, in paragraph  5 of his declaration in support of the motion for attorneys’ fees, he misstated  that his hourly rate is $750.00 per hour when his actual rate is $800.00 per  hour. (01/26/24 Decl. of Brad Lee at ¶ 4.)  On February 2, 2024, Defendant filed a  Notice of Errata indicating that Defendant is only seeking total attorneys’  fees in the amount of $283,295.00.    On March 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed an  opposition to Defendant’s motion for attorneys’ fees. Plaintiff does not take  issue with the reasonableness of Defendant’s requested attorneys’ fees. Rather,  Plaintiff argues that the motion is untimely and should therefore be denied.  Defendant filed a reply brief on April 2,  2024.   At the April 11, 2024, a hearing on  Defendant’s motion for attorney’s fees occurred, the Court continued the  hearing on the motion to April 29, 2024, to allow Plaintiff to submit a supplemental  brief on the sole issue of the timeliness of this Motion.   On April 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed and served  a Response to Defendant’s Request for Relief from Failure to Timely File a Motion  for Attorneys’ Fees along with a declaration from Kwang Lee, who is the Chief  Operations Officer for Plaintiff, in support thereof. Although not raised by the parties, the  Court finds that Plaintiff’s pending appeal of the Court’s judgment does not  prohibit the Court from ruling on the instant motion because “[a] motion for  attorneys’ fees is not premature despite the filing of a notice of appeal.” (Bankes  v. Lucas (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 365, 368.)    Legal  Standard “In any action on a contract, where the  contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are  incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded to either one of the  parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the  prevailing party on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in  the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in  addition to other costs.” (Civ. Code, § 1717, subd. (a).) “The court, upon  notice and motion by a party, shall determine who is the party prevailing on  the contract . . . whether or not the suit proceeds to final judgment.” (Civ.  Code, § 1717, subd. (b)(1).) “[T]he party prevailing on the contract shall be  the party who received a greater relief in the action on the contract.” (Civ.  Code, § 1717, subd. (b)(1).) A prevailing party is defined as “a defendant as  against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).) An award of attorneys’ fees should  compensate “for all time spent, including time spent on fee-related issues.” (Downey  Cares v. Downey Community Development Com. (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 983, 997.)   “It is well established that the  determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the  discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence  of an abuse of discretion.” (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618,  623.) The fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily “begins with the  ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied  by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc.  (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) “The reasonable hourly rate is that  prevailing in the community for similar work.” (Margolin v. Regional  Planning Com. (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.)   “[A] computation of time spent on a case  and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an  appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Margolin v. Regional Planning Com. (1982)  134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.) The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on  consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the  fair market value for the legal services provided. (See Serrano v. Priest  (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49 [discussing factors relevant to proper attorneys’ fees  award].) Such an approach anchors the trial court’s analysis to an objective  determination of the value of the attorney’s services, ensuring that the amount  awarded is not arbitrary. (Id. at p. 48, fn. 23.) The factors considered  in determining the modification of the lodestar include “(1) the novelty and  difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting  them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other  employment by the attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”  (Mountjoy v. Bank of Am. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 266, 271.) “[T]he  burden is on the party seeking attorney fees to prove that the fees it seeks  are reasonable.” (Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp. (2009) 178  Cal.App.4th 44, 98.) “[A]n award of attorney fees may be based on counsel’s  declarations, without production of detailed time records.” (Raining Data  Corp. v. Barrenechea (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1365.)  Where a party is challenging the  reasonableness of attorney’s fees as excessive that party must attack itemized  billing with evidence that the fees claimed were not appropriate or obtain the  declaration of an attorney with expertise in the procedural and substantive law  to demonstrate that the fees claimed were unreasonable.  (Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550,  563-564.)  “[I]t is the burden of the  challenging party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient  argument and citations to the evidence and arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not  suffice.” (Id. at p. 564.)  It is well established that the determination  of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of  the trial court.  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1096.)   A “court should defer to the winning  lawyer’s professional judgment as to the tasks completed in an action because  he won, and might not have, had he been more of a slacker.” (Moreno v. City  of Sacramento (9th Cir. 2008) 534 F.3d 1106, 1111.) A losing party cannot  litigate tenaciously then be heard to complain about the time spent or tasks  performed by the prevailing party in response.   (City of Riverside v. Rivera (1986) 477 U.S. 561, 580,  fn.11.)  Where a defendant does not  produce evidence contradicting the reasonableness of counsel’s hourly rates,  the Court will deem an attorney’s hourly rate as reasonable.  (Goglin v. BMW of North America, LLC  (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 462, 473.) Discussion Untimeliness   Plaintiff contends that the motion for  attorneys’ fees should be denied because Defendant filed to timely file such a  motion and disregarded the obligation to seek relief from the deadline. Defendant  contends that the Court is empowered to grant relief from an untimely motion  seeking attorneys’ fees pursuant to California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1702. “A notice of motion to claim attorney’s  fees for services up to and including the rendition  of  judgment in the trial court . . . must be served and filed within the time for  filing a notice of appeal under rules 8.104 and 8.108 in an unlimited civil  case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1702, subd. (b)(1).) “For good cause, the  trial judge may extend the time for filing a motion for attorney’s fees in the  absence of a stipulation or for a longer period than allowed by stipulation.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1702, subd. (d).) A party has 60 days from service  of notice of entry of judgment to file a notice of appeal. (Cal. Rules of  Court, Rule 8.104, subd. (a)(1)(A).) If a motion for new trial is denied, then  the time to appeal from the judgment is extended until the earliest of: (1) 30  days after the superior court clerk or a party serves an order denying the  motion or a notice of entry of that order; (2) 30 days after denial of the  motion by operation of law; or (3) 180 days after entry of judgment. (Cal.  Rules of Court, Rule 8.108, subd. (b)(1)(A)-(C).)              “While an attorney fee motion should  be timely filed, the rule provisions are mandatory but not jurisdictional, and  on a proper showing under section 473, the trial court may grant relief for  such mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (Community  Youth Athletic Center v. City of National City (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1385,  1444.) “[T]he trial court has considerably more latitude in ruling on an  extension of time to file an attorney’s fees motion under the good cause  standard of Rule 3.1702(d) than it does granting relief from a judgment,  dismissal [or] order under Code of Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision  (b).” (Robinson v. U-Haul Co. of California (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 304,  327.) “Even a claim of inadvertence, if it is not prejudicial, may constitute  good cause for a late filing.” (Id. at p. 326.) “Rule 3.1702(d) is ‘remedial’  and is to be given a liberal, rather than strict interpretation.” (Ibid.,  citation omitted.) Good  cause means “a good reason for a party’s failure to perform that specific  requirement [of the statute] from which he seeks to be excused.” (Ibid.)               The party seeking relief from an  untimely filed motion for attorneys’ fees “bears the burden of proof in  establishing a right to relief.” (Hopkins & Carley v. Gens (200  Cal.App.4th 1401, 1410.) “It is simply not enough to assert a general state of  misapprehension or ignorance on some subject bearing on a possible defense.” (Ibid.)  Although “courts are liberal in relieving parties of defaults caused by  inadvertence or excusable neglect, they do not act as guardians for incompetent  parties or parties who are grossly careless as to their own affairs. There must  be rules and regulations by which rights are determined and judgments become  final.” (Id. at p. 1415, internal quotations omitted.)   The Untimely Filing of the Instant Motion Defendant’s motion for attorneys’ fees  should have been filed no later than August 16, 2023, which would have been 30  days from the date the Clerk mailed the Court’s ruling as to Plaintiff’s motion  for a new trial. Thus, it is undisputed that the instant motion is untimely. On  reply, Defendant’s counsel, Brad Lee (“Lee”), declares that he failed to  calendar the last day to file the motion for attorneys’ fees and such failure  was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. (Lee Reply Decl., ¶ 8.)   Excusable  Neglect              In its April 19, 2024, brief, Plaintiff  argues that Defendant has not shown excusable neglect. “A party seeking . . .  relief on the ground of attorney error must demonstrate that the error was  excusable, since the attorney’s negligence is imputed to the client.” (Huh  v. Wang (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 1406, 1419.) “The inexcusable negligence of  an attorney is usually not a proper basis for granting the client’s motion  under section 473.” (Ibid.) “Excusable neglect is that neglect which  might have been the act of a reasonably prudent person under the same  circumstances.” (Ibid.) The “press of business alone generally does not  constitute grounds for relief.” (Id. at p. 1423.) “To constitute grounds  for relief, an exceptional workload generally must be accompanied by some  factor outside the attorney’s control that makes the situation unmanageable,  such as a mistake caused by a glitch in office machinery or an error by  clerical staff.” (Id. at p. 1424.) A court is not required to grant  discretionary relief where counsel failed to calendar a matter. (Ibid.)             Here, the Court finds that Defendant  has not made a showing of excusable neglect to warrant relief from the untimely  filing of the motion for attorneys’ fees. Counsel merely declares that he  failed to calendar the last day to file the instant motion and there were other  pressing matters in the office. (Lee Reply Decl., ¶ 8.) Besides other pressing  matters in counsel’s office, Defendant offers no explanation of circumstances  outside of counsel’s control that would allow a showing of excusable neglect. Thus,  under Huh v. Wang, supra, 158 Cal.App.4th 1406, 1424-25,  Defendant has not made a showing of excusable neglect. The Court also notes that  in opposition to the motion to strike costs, Defendant argued that the pending  appeal and Plaintiff’s motion for new trial were a basis for Defendant not  filing a memorandum of costs or motion for attorneys’ fees. (See 01/31/24  Opposition at pp. 3-5.)                  Mistake             Plaintiff asserts that Defendant has  not shown a valid basis for relief based on mistake. “An honest mistake of law  can provide a valid ground for relief, at least where a problem is complex and  debatable, but relief may be properly denied where the record shows only  ignorance of the law coupled with negligence in ascertaining it.” (Hopkins  & Carley v. Gens, supra, 200 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1412-13.) “In  considering whether a mistake of law furnishes grounds for relief, the  determining factors are the reasonableness of the misconception and the  justifiability of lack of determination of the correct law.” (Id. at p.  1413, internal quotations omitted.)              The Court finds that Defendant has  not made a sufficient showing that its failure to file a timely motion for  attorneys’ fees was due to mistake. The declaration of counsel states that the  failure to timely file the instant motion for attorneys’ fees was due to  counsel’s failure to calendar the last day for filing. (Lee Reply Decl., ¶ 8.) However,  in opposition to the motion to strike the memorandum of costs, Defendant argued  that its obligation to file a motion for attorneys’ fees was stayed due to the motion  for new trial and pending appeal. (See 01/31/24 Opposition at pp. 3-5.) Counsel,  however, in the reply declaration sets forth no efforts to ascertain the state  of the law. Also, counsel does not provide a factual explanation of why his  mistake in calendaring should be excused. (Hopkins & Carley v. Gens,  supra, 200 Cal.App.4th 1401, 1410 [explaining that trial court properly  denied relief under CCP § 473 where declaration did not “explain why [the]  failure should be excused.”].)               Inadvertence             Although not specifically addressing  inadvertence in its April 19, 2024 brief, the Court will address the purported  inadvertence in Defendant failing to timely file the instant motion. A party  must show that their inadvertence was excusable. (Zamora v. Clayborn  Contracting Group, Inc. (2002) 28 Cal.4th 249, 258.) “In determining  whether the attorney’s . . . inadvertence was excusable, the court inquires  whether a reasonably prudent person under the same or similar  circumstances might have made the same error.” (Ibid.) “Conduct falling  below the professional standard of care . . . is not therefore excusable.” (Ibid.)               The Court finds that the  inadvertence of counsel is not excusable. The failure to calendar a matter due  to pressing other matters, without more, is not deemed excusable conduct to  warrant relief under CCP § 473. (Huh v. Wang, supra, 158  Cal.App.4th 1406, 1423-24.)              The Lack of Diligence and  Prejudice              Plaintiff asserts that Defendant  failed to act with reasonable diligence and his attempt to argue for relief in  a reply brief is procedurally defective. (04/19/24 Brief at pp. 5-6.) Plaintiff  also contends that the delay caused prejudice because it acted in reliance on  Defendant’s waiver of the right to timely claim attorney fees. (04/19/24 Brief  at p. 6.)              A party seeking relief under the  provisions of CCP § 473 must show diligence. (Huh v. Wang (2007) 158  Cal.App.4th 1406, 1420.) “Section 473 is often applied liberally where the  party . . . moves promptly to seek relief, and the party opposing the motion  will not suffer prejudice if it is granted.” (Ibid.) “But relief is not  warranted unless the moving party demonstrates diligence in seeking it.” (Ibid.)  “The moving party has a double burden: He must show a satisfactory excuse for  his default, and he must show diligence in making the motion after discovery of  the default.” (Ibid., internal quotations omitted.) “Whether a party has  acted diligently is a factual question for the trial court.” (Ibid.)             The Court finds that Defendant filed  the instant motion on September 26, 2023, when it should have been filed no  later than August 16, 2023. Counsel offers no explanation in his reply  declaration as to why Defendant waited 40 days to file the instant motion after  it became due. Counsel does not attest to when it was discovered that Defendant  needed to file a motion for attorneys’ fees. The Court also notes that  Defendant only first explained its untimely filing in connection with the reply  brief, which was filed on April 2, 2024. Defendant has therefore not shown  diligence.              As to prejudice, Kwang Lee (“Lee”) declares  in connection with the April 19, 2024 brief  that because Defendant had not filed or served  a motion for attorneys’ fees, he believed that Defendant had lost the  opportunity to recover fees from Plaintiff. (Lee Decl., ¶ 4.) After August 18,  2023, Plaintiff spent some of the money it had been reserving to pay a possible  attorney fee award. (Lee Decl., ¶ 5.) In particular, the company made  shareholder distributions totaling $180,000.00 between August 18, 2023, and  September 13, 2023. (Lee Decl., ¶ 5.) Lee states that had Plaintiff known that  Defendant would be allowed to belatedly file a motion for attorneys’ fees,  Plaintiff would have continued to delay certain expenditures. (Lee Decl., ¶ 6.)  If Plaintiff is now held liable for Defendant’s attorneys’ fees, Plaintiff will  have a refrain from further expenditures it planned to continue for expansion  in the market. (Lee Decl., ¶ 7.)              The Court finds that Defendant’s  delay in bringing its motion for attorneys’ fees has prejudiced Plaintiff. Prejudice  occurs “when a [plaintiff] has changed his position in a way that would not  have occurred if the [defendant] had not delayed.” (George v. Shams-Shirazi (2020)  45 Cal.App.5th 134, 142.) Plaintiff has shown that had the motion for  attorneys’ fees been timely filed, Plaintiff would not have made certain  financial expenditures. Thus, prejudice has been shown.              As such, the Court finds that  Defendant has not shown a basis for relief from its untimely filing under CCP §  473 on the grounds of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. Defendant  has not shown diligence and the Court finds that Plaintiff has shown that it  will be prejudiced if Defendant is provided relief from its untimely filing.  Moreover, the Court finds that counsel’s declaration submitted on reply does  not make a showing of good cause for relief from its untimely filing.              Due to the Court’s findings above,  the Court need not address whether Defendant is the prevailing party or assess  the reasonableness of the claimed fees.               CONCLUSION AND ORDER For the foregoing reasons, Defendant Hyunmok  Cho aka Hank Cho’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees is DENIED.      Plaintiff  CreditCard Data Services, Inc. is ordered to provide notice and file proof of  service of such.   DATED: April 11, 2024                                                         ___________________________                                                                                           Yolanda  Orozco                                                                                           Judge  of the Superior Court
