And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to requests for production, set one, filed by the plaintiff, Soledad Meza, against General Motors, LLC. The plaintiff seeks to compel the defendant to provide further responses to the requests for production, which were filed in July 2023.

The judge finds that the plaintiff's meet and confer efforts were sufficient, although fruitless. The judge grants the motion in part and denies it in part. The judge orders the defendant to provide further responses in line with the court's order within 30 days of this order.

The judge concludes that the plaintiff's requests for production, set one, are overly broad and unduly burdensome. The judge grants requests 49 and 50, which seek information about policies and procedures related to the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and training manuals or training materials provided to persons responsible for determining repurchase or replacement, respectively. The judge denies requests 16-21 and 51, which seek information about electrical defects and repair history.

The judge notes that the plaintiff's definition of "electrical defect" is overly broad and unduly burdensome, and that the requests for production, set one, seek information that is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The judge concludes that the requests for production, set one, are not tailored to the specific repair complaints reported by the plaintiff and are instead seeking information that is not relevant to the case.

The judge orders the defendant to provide further responses in line with the court's order within 30 days of this order.
