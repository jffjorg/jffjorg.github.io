And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the plaintiffs' motion to enforce the settlement agreement, but has stayed the enforcement of the liquidated damages provision through January 1, 2024. The defendant, Nourit Korzennik, is required to vacate the premises by January 1, 2024, and will be subject to a daily liquidated damage of $1,000 if she fails to do so. Korzennik will also be required to pay the plaintiffs' reasonable attorney fees in the amount of $2,500.

The court has found that Korzennik's failure to vacate the premises is a breach of the settlement agreement, and that her claims of impracticability and near impossibility due to the real estate market and her agoraphobia are not valid excuses. The court has also found that the settlement agreement is enforceable and binding, and that the plaintiffs are entitled to attorney fees for having to defend themselves and enforce the agreement.

The court's ruling is based on the California Civil Code and the Code of Civil Procedure, and is guided by the principles of contract law and the purpose of encouraging the voluntary settlement of litigation.
