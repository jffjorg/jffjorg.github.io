 Case Number:  22STCV23872    Hearing Date:   April 30, 2024    Dept:  31 DEPT:   31 OSC DATE:  04/30/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  22STCV23872 BREANA JENKINS vs POSH MANAGEMENT, INC. dba PARADISE LA UNCUT, et al. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  POSH MANAGEMENT, INC. dba PARADISE LA UNCUT RECOMMENDATION:  DENY.   TENTATIVE  Plaintiff Breana Jenkins (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Posh Management, Inc. dba Paradise LA Uncut (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 20 for damages arising from a slip and fall on liquid while Plaintiff was a customer on Defendant’s premises. Plaintiff alleges Defendant knew a dangerous condition existed on the premises and failed to correct the condition or warn of its existence. Plaintiff has dismissed all unnamed Doe defendants.  This is Plaintiff’s second request for default judgment. The Court previously denied the request filed on May 15, 2023, noting that Plaintiff utilized an outdated CIV-100, JUD-100, and failed to provide a proper declaration attesting to her damages. (Min. Order, Feb. 13, 2024.)   On February 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed a JUD-100 and her own declaration to cure the deficiency. However, Plaintiff failed to file a new CIV-100. Use of CIV-100 is mandatory pursuant to CRC 3.1800(a). Because no CIV-100 was filed, there is no proper application for the Court’s consideration.   Plaintiff must file a complete default package, which consists of the individual filings of CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2023], JUD-100 [Rev. January 1, 2024], and her declaration at the same time. The Court will not consider piecemeal documents filed on different dates.   No later than __________, Plaintiff is to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The OSC re entry of default judgment is continued to _________.
