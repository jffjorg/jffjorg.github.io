And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a motion filed by plaintiff Ranim Roger Baroud's attorney, James L. Pocrass, Esq., to be relieved as counsel. The motion was unopposed and was based on an irreparable breakdown in the working relationship between the attorney and the plaintiff, resulting in irreconcilable differences that made it difficult to provide effective representation. The attorney had served the plaintiff by mail and filed proof of service of the motion, declaration, and proposed order. The judge noted that the plaintiff has sufficient time to seek new counsel or prepare for trial before a trial date is set.
