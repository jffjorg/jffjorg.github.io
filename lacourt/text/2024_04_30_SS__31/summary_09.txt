Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Vonda Washington v. City of Los Angeles, et al. The ruling addresses two motions: one for leave to file an amended answer with affirmative defenses, and another for leave to file a cross-complaint against the City. The judge denies the first motion without prejudice due to procedural deficiencies, including the lack of a redlined copy of the proposed amendments and an incomplete declaration in support of the motion. The judge grants the second motion, finding that the proposed cross-complaint is permissive and in the interest of justice. The judge orders Jones to file a separate copy of the cross-complaint within ten days.
