And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge grants Regional Connector Constructors, Inc.'s (RCC) motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Northwest Excavating, Inc. for equitable indemnity, declaratory relief, express indemnity, and implied indemnity. The Judge finds that the proposed cross-complaint and complaints arise from the same incident and should be litigated together. The Judge also notes that there is no evidence of RCC being dilatory in seeking to file the cross-complaint, and there is no apparent prejudice to any party. The motion is granted, and RCC is ordered to file a separate copy of the cross-complaint within 10 days.
