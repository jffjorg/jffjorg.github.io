And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies without prejudice the motion to substitute Fernanda M. Clark as the successor-in-interest of the deceased plaintiff, William Clark. The court finds that the supporting declaration of Mrs. Clark is insufficient because it was not executed and filed by Mrs. Clark herself, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 377.32. The court notes that the opposition of LAFC Partners, LLLP, states that the declaration is not in compliance with the required elements. The court orders the moving party to give notice and encourages the parties to meet and confer to reach an agreement.
