And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendants, Aria Servatjoo, Nahid Servatjoo, and Parviz Servatjoo. The plaintiff seeks damages of $228,532 and costs of $2,143. The complaint alleges that Aria struck the plaintiff in the face and that the defendants, who are the parents of Aria, had a duty to control Aria's actions and prevent her from inflicting bodily harm on the plaintiff. However, the court finds that the plaintiff has not pled a basis of liability against the defendants, as there is no allegation that they were involved in the incident or that they breached a duty to the plaintiff. The court also notes that the plaintiff's counsel's declaration asserting that Aria was a minor at the time of the incident does not cure the issue. The court is unable to grant judgment as to the defendants, and the plaintiff is ordered to consider its next steps, including the option of amending the complaint to state a cognizable basis of liability or dismissing the defendants from the complaint.
