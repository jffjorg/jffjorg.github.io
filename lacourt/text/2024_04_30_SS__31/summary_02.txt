Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to enforce a settlement agreement between the Plaintiff, Alan Sandleman, and the Defendant, Jagwinder Singh. The Judge ruled that the parties did not meet the statutory requirements of CCP § 664.6, which requires a single writing containing the material terms of the agreement and signed by both parties. The Judge found that there was no evidence of a writing signed by the parties, which is necessary to enforce the settlement agreement. The Judge also pointed out that the parties did not meet and confer before the mediation and that the settlement agreement was not signed by both parties. Therefore, the Judge denied the Plaintiff's motion to enforce the settlement agreement.
