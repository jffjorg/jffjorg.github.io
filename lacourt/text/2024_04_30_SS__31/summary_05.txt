The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Natacia Samayoa vs. Rodrigo Saldana, et al. The defendant, Rodrigo Saldana, filed a motion to quash service of the summons and complaint, but the Judge has denied the motion without prejudice due to procedural deficiencies. Specifically, the notice of motion provided an impossible date and time for the hearing, and there was no proof of service demonstrating that the plaintiff had been served with the motion. The Judge cited Cal. Civ. Code ยง1005(b) as the basis for the ruling. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with specific information.
