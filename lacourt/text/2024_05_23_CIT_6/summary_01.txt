1. Duty: Starbucks owed a duty of care to Plaintiff, as a customer, to provide a safe beverage.
2. Breach: The court found that Starbucks failed to meet its duty of care, as the lid of the coffee cup was not properly secured, leading to the spill and burn injury to the Plaintiff.
3. Causation: The court concluded that the spill was reasonably foreseeable and that the failure to secure the lid was a proximate cause of the Plaintiff's injuries.

The court found that a triable issue of material fact exists regarding the issue of proximate cause and denied the motion for summary judgment.
