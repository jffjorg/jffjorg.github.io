And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on an application by CAIC to bring a summary judgment motion based on the statute of limitations. CAIC claims that the plaintiffs' counsel knew about Mercury's policy in November 2022 and seeks to attach a letter and a declaration from counsel to prove this. The judge finds it hard to believe that the plaintiffs' counsel did not know about Mercury's policy and suggests that CAIC attach the letter and declaration as part of the summary judgment motion. The judge advises CAIC to file the motion quickly, as there is still time to do so. If the motion is filed less than 105 days before the trial date, it will not be heard.
