And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge rejects the defendant's demurrer, ruling that the complaint adequately states a cause of action. The judge also rejects the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages, as the plaintiff has withdrawn the claim for such damages. The judge notes that the defendant's challenge to the pleadings is premature and should be addressed in a summary judgment motion rather than a demurrer. The judge also rejects the defendant's argument that the complaint does not adequately allege conspiracy, ruling that the plaintiff's allegations of conspiracy are proper and should be addressed in an evidentiary motion rather than a pleading motion. The defendant has 15 days to answer the complaint.
