Prologis, Inc. (24STCV07273)
Tentative Ruling Re: Motion for Protective
Order 
 
Date:                           1/3/25
Time:                          10:00
am
Moving Party:           Akiva Nourollah and Yaakov Nourollah
(collectively the “Nourollahs”)
Opposing Party:        People of the State of California ex
rel. California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Los Angeles Region (the
“Water Board”)
Department:              11
Judge:                        David S. Cunningham III

TENTATIVE RULING
 
The Nourollahs’ motion for protective order is granted.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This case arises from a warehouse fire near the Dominguez Channel in
Carson, California.  The fire and efforts
to put it out allegedly caused hazardous materials to enter the Dominguez
Channel, creating a foul odor that made thousands of people sick.
 
Here, the Nourollahs move for a
protective order to stay their depositions pending resolution of a parallel
criminal action.
 
DISCUSSION
 
The Nourollahs contend the motion
should be granted because:
 
* the Nourollahs “have been
charged with felony offenses” in the criminal case (Motion, p. 4);
 
* this case and the criminal case
“aris[e] from the exact same alleged events” (id. at pp. 2-3);
 
* the Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination applies in civil cases when testimonies that could
be self-incriminating are sought (see id.at p. 3);
 
* the Water Board can obtain the
requested information by other means (see id. at pp. 5-7; see also Reply, pp.
3, 4-5); and 
 
* the Water Board previously
admitted that it does not need the Nourollahs’ testimonies (see Reply, pp.
2-3.)
 
In response, the Water Board
filed a qualified non-opposition.  The
Water Board claims it would suffer prejudice if a protective order is entered
but the case is not stayed or the trial date is not continued (the Water
Board’s motion to stay is also set for hearing on January 3rd).  (See Qualified Non-Opposition, p. 2 [arguing
that (1) absent a stay, the Water Board would be forced to litigate this case
without the Nourollahs’ testimonies, and (2) a stay or continuance is an
adequate alternative measure].)
 
California law permits a court to
“stay discovery until disposition of any pending criminal proceedings or until
the statute of limitations has run on criminal prosecution, so that defendant
can no longer claim a Fifth Amendment privilege.”  (Edmon & Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide:
Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2024 Update) ¶ 8:136 [citing
Pacers, Inc. v. Superior Court (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 686].)  In fact, California law recognizes multiple
accommodation options: (1) “stay the civil proceeding until disposition of the
related criminal prosecution[;]” (2) “allow the civil defendant to invoke the
privilege against self-incrimination, even if doing so may limit the
defendant’s ability to put on a defense[;]” (3) “confer[] an immunity on the
party invoking the privilege[;]” or (4) “preclude[e] a litigant who claims the
constitutional privilege against self-incrimination in discovery from waiving
the privilege and testifying at trial to matters upon which the privilege had
been asserted.”  (Fuller v. Superior
Court (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 299, 307-308.)
 
Given these rules, the Court
agrees with the Nourollahs.  Staying the
Nourollahs’ depositions is a sufficient way to protect their interests against
self-incrimination while allowing the other parties to seek the requested
information via other sources – e.g., non-party depositions, depositions of
persons most knowledgeable, and document requests.  (See Motion, p. 5.)  The Court believes this accommodation option
strikes a fair balance.  
 
Moreover, on the current record,
the Water Board fails to show prejudice in that it fails to show that the
requested information is not available from the other sources.  (See Reply, pp. 3-5.)
 
Accordingly, the motion is
granted.
 
However, the Court is inclined to
leave open the possibility of reconsidering this issue in the future once the
other sources have been exhausted.

TENTATIVE RULING
 
The Water Board’s motion to stay/continue trial is denied in part and
granted in part.  It is denied as to the
stay request, and it is granted as to the trial-continuance request.  The trial will be continued for three
to six months, and the Court will reevaluate the continuance at the end of that
period.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This case arises from a warehouse fire near the Dominguez Channel in
Carson, California.  The fire and efforts
to put it out allegedly caused hazardous materials to enter the Dominguez
Channel, creating a foul odor that made thousands of people sick.
 
Here, the Water Board moves to
stay the case or continue the trial pending resolution of a parallel criminal
action.
 
DISCUSSION
 
Water Board
 
The trial date is March 24, 2025.
 
The Water Board contends the case
should be stayed or the trial date should be continued because:
 
* Akiva Nourollah, Yosef
Nourollah, Yehuda Nourollah and Yaakov Nourollah are named Defendants in the
criminal case (see Motion, p. 3);
 
* Akiva Nourollah and Yakov
Nourollah filed a motion for protective order to stay their depositions until
the criminal case is resolved to protect their Fifth Amendment interests
against self-incrimination (the motion for protective order is also set for
hearing on January 3rd) (see ibid.);
 
* the Water Board would suffer
prejudice if it is forced to litigate this case without all of the Nourollahs’
testimonies (see ibid.; see also id. at pp. 7-11 [claiming adequate substitutes
for the Nourollahs’ testimonies do not exist]); and
 
* it is likely that a stay would
benefit all parties by making the “eventual prosecution of [this] case more
efficient.”  (Id. at p. 3; see also id.
at pp. 6-7.) 
 
Tenant Defendants
 
The Tenant Defendants
disagree.  They assert:
 
* all parties and the public
would benefit from this case being resolved promptly (see Tenant Defendants’
Opposition, pp. 7-8);
 
* this Court, not the criminal
court, should resolve the complex factual and legal issues (see id. at pp. 3,
7-8);
 
* the Water Board fails to show
that it needs Akiva’s and Yakov’s testimonies (see id. at pp. 9-10);
 
* the requested information can
be obtained by other means (see id. at pp. 10-11); and
 
* the Water Board already has the
information necessary to bring their case. 
(See id. at p. 11.)
 
Prologis Defendants
 
The Prologis Defendants claim: 
 
* the parties stipulated to the
trial date (see Prologis Defendants’ Opposition, pp. 4, 9);
 
* the Water Board previously
argued against a stay and asserted that the Nourollahs’ testimonies are
irrelevant (see id. at pp. 4, 8);
 
* the Water Board filed this
action despite having knowledge of the criminal case (see id. at pp. 4-5, 11);
 
* the Water Board fails to show
prejudice warranting a stay (see id. at pp. 10-12); and
 
* the Water Board fails to
analyze the factors for a trial continuance. 
(See id. at pp. 7-10.)
 
Reply
 
In reply, the Water Board states:
 
* judicial estoppel is
inapplicable (see Reply, pp. 2-4);
 
* the Water Board’s knowledge of
the criminal case is not a sufficient reason to deny a stay or continuance (see
id. at pp. 4-5);
 
* Due process requires that the
Water Board receive an opportunity to depose Akiva and Yakov before trial (see
id. at pp. 5-6);
 
* the Water Board needs the
Akiva’s and Yakov’s testimonies (see id. at pp. 6-8); and
 
* a stay or continuance would not
prejudice the other parties.  (See id. at
p. 9.)
 
Analysis
 
California law permits a court to
“stay discovery until disposition of any pending criminal proceedings or until
the statute of limitations has run on criminal prosecution, so that defendant
can no longer claim a Fifth Amendment privilege.”  (Edmon & Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide:
Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2024 Update) ¶ 8:136 [citing
Pacers, Inc. v. Superior Court (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 686].)  In fact, California law recognizes multiple
accommodation options: (1) “stay the civil proceeding until disposition of the
related criminal prosecution[;]” (2) “allow the civil defendant to invoke the
privilege against self-incrimination, even if doing so may limit the
defendant’s ability to put on a defense[;]” (3) “confer[] an immunity on the
party invoking the privilege[;]” or (4) “preclude[e] a litigant who claims the
constitutional privilege against self-incrimination in discovery from waiving
the privilege and testifying at trial to matters upon which the privilege had
been asserted.”  (Fuller v. Superior
Court (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 299, 307-308.)
 
For a trial continuance, “[a]n affirmative
showing of ‘good cause’ according to Judicial Council standards is required on
a motion for continuance before or during trial.”  (Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶
12:452.)  “[C]ircumstances [that] may
indicate the presence of good cause” include:
 
— unavailability
of essential percipient or expert witness because of death,
illness or other excusable circumstances; [citation]
 
— unavailability of
a party because of death, illness or other excusable circumstances;
[citation]
 
— unavailability
of trial counsel because of death, illness or other excusable
circumstances; [citation]
 
— substitution of
trial counsel where there is an “affirmative showing that the substitution
is required in the interests of justice”; [citation]
 
— addition of a new
party if the new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct
discovery and prepare for trial or the other parties have not had an adequate
opportunity to prepare for trial in regard to the new party; [citation]
 
— a party's
inability to obtain essential testimony, documents or other
material evidence despite diligent efforts; [citation] or
 
— a significant
unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of which
the case is not ready for trial. [Citation.]
 
(Id. at ¶
12:455 [citing Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c)], emphasis in original.)
 
Given these rules, the Court
finds that the Water Board’s stay request is overbroad and should be
denied.  In the tentative ruling on the
motion for protective order, which the Court incorporates, the Court grants the
motion without prejudice to the main issue – whether the Water Board should be
barred from deposing Akiva and Yakov until the criminal case is finished –
possibly being reevaluated after the Water Board exhausts alternative discovery
sources, for example, non-party depositions, depositions of persons most
knowledgeable, and document requests.  As
explained there, the Court believes this accommodation option strikes a fair
balance between protecting Akiva’s and Yakov’s interests against
self-incrimination and the other parties’ interests in seeking the requested
information via other sources to move the litigation toward trial and/or
resolution.  A full-blown stay would be
incongruent with this balance and, on the current record, does not appear
appropriate.
 
The trial-continuance request is
a different story.  The Water Board filed
this case less than 10 months ago.  The
trial is set to start one year from the filing date.  One year is exceptionally short for a complex
case of this magnitude, novelty, and complexity, especially considering the
related and consolidated matters, the numerous diverse parties, the competing
interests, and the work delays caused by the holiday season.  The impact of this shortened timeframe is
intensified by the Court’s decision to make Akiva’s and Yakov’s testimonies
unavailable to the Water Board.  Akiva
and Yakov are witnesses and parties.  The
Fifth Amendment privilege is an excusable reason for rendering them
unavailable.  At this late hour,
effectively impelling the Water Board to use other discovery methods to acquire
what might be, and likely is, essential information establishes a good-faith
basis to continue the trial for three to six months.
 
The prior stipulation does not
change the analysis.  The Water Board
agreed to the trial date within the first three months of the litigation and
did so with caveats.  (See Reply, p.
6.)  Again, Akiva and Yakov are witnesses
and parties.  It is reasonble to expect
that they have material information. 
Since the Water Board is now going to have to try to get that
information from other sources, an effort that appears to have proven difficult
up to this point (see ibid.), strict enforcement of the stipulation would be
unreasonable.  
 
Similarly, the judicial-estoppel
argument is unavailing.  “Even if the
necessary elements of judicial estoppel are found, because judicial estoppel is
an equitable doctrine [citations], whether it should be applied is a matter
within the discretion of the trial court [citations].”  (Blix Street Records, Inc. v. Cassidy
(2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 39, 46-47.) 
Yes, the Water Board opposed a stay in the administrative action, but a
stay is inappropriate here.  The Court is
only granting a limited trial continuance due to the changing facts, namely,
Akiva’s and Yakov’s unavailability and the need to request information from
other sources.   It would be inequitable
to apply judicial estoppel to the situation here.
 
The concern about the criminal
court deciding the complex legal and factual issues is unpersuasive.  The Court is not granting a continuance until
the criminal trial ends.  The proposed
continuance is short to medium.  This
Court will still be in a position to decide those issues after the continuance.
 
Finally, the cases cited by the
parties are mostly unhelpful and do not compel a different result.  People ex rel. Harris v. Rizzo (2013)
214 Cal.App.4th 921 is distinguishable for the reasons stated in the
reply.  (See Reply, pp. 4-5.)  People v. Coleman (1975) 13 Cal.3d 867,
People ex rel. Burns v. Wood (2024) 103 Cal.App.5th 700, and Pacers,
Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 162 Cal.App.3d 686 are distinguishable for
the reasons stated in the Prologis Defendants’ opposition.  (See Prologis Defendants’ Opposition, p. 11.)
 
In summary, the Water Board’s
motion is:
 
* denied as to the stay request;
and
 
* granted, as modified, as to the
trial-continuance request.
 
The Court intends to continue the
trial for three to six months and to reexamine the continuance at that time.
