And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for summary judgment filed by Parking Concepts, Inc. (Parking Concepts) against Tracy Lynn Kamar (Plaintiff) in a premises liability case. The case involves a tripping hazard caused by a parking block in a disabled-accessible parking stall owned by Parking Concepts. Parking Concepts argues that the parking block's dangerous condition was open and obvious, and that they had no notice of the condition. The judge finds that Parking Concepts has met their initial burden of showing that the condition was open and obvious. However, the judge also finds that Plaintiff has raised a triable issue of material fact as to whether Parking Concepts knew or should have known of the subject parking block's dangerous condition. Therefore, the judge denies Parking Concepts' motion for summary judgment.
