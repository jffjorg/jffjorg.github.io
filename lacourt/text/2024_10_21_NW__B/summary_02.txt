And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment against the defendant. The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant alleging negligence and general negligence, and default was entered against the defendant. However, the plaintiff's request for default judgment was deficient in several ways, including the failure to serve a Statement of Damages, failure to file a Form CIV-100, and lack of documentary evidence to support the amount of damages sought. The judge also noted that the plaintiff was put on notice at a prior OSC that a third defective filing would risk dismissal for failure to prosecute. As a result, the defendant is dismissed without prejudice.
