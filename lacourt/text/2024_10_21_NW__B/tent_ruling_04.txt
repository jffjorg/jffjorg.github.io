COMPLAINT
  FILED: JUNE 7, 2022
TRIAL
  DATE: FEBRUARY 24, 2025



 
I.      
BACKGROUND  
On June 7, 2022, Plaintiff
Tracy Lynn Kamar (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against
Defendants Parking Concepts, Inc. (“Parking Concepts”), and Does 1 to 25
(collectively “Defendants”) alleging two causes of action: (1) general
negligence; and (2) premises liability. The complaint arises from a February
25, 2022, incident where Plaintiff allegedly sustained serious injuries after
tripping over Defendant’s negligently placed parking block. 
On April 21, 2023, Parking
Concepts filed the instant motion for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s
complaint. 
On June 5, 2024, the matter
was reassigned to the Honorable Judge Moskowitz in Department B of Van Nuys
Courthouse East, effective June 24, 2024. 
On October 4, 2024,
Plaintiff filed their opposition. 
On October 14, 2024, Parking
Concepts filed their reply. 
 
II.      
MOTION
FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT
            Parking Concepts moves for summary
judgment on Plaintiff’s complaint on the following grounds: (1) the alleged
dangerous condition was so open, obvious, and avoidable that Parking Concepts
had no duty to warn or remedy the condition; and (2) Parking Concepts had no
notice of a dangerous condition. Therefore, Parking Concepts argues that they do
not owe Plaintiff a duty as a matter of law. (Notice of Motion, p. 2:
6-10.) 
 
III.      
LEGAL
STANDARDS 
Burden on Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication 
In reviewing a motion for
summary judgment, the Court must apply a three-step analysis: (1) identify the
issues framed by the pleadings; (2) determine whether the moving party has met
his or her initial burden; and (3) determine whether the opposition has
demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue.  (Hinesley
v. Oakshade Town Center (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 289, 294.)  “[T]he
initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that
there are no triable issues of material fact.”  (Scalf v. D.B. Log
Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) A defendant moving for
summary judgment or summary adjudication has met his or her burden of showing
that a cause of action has no merit if the party has shown that one or more
elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a
complete defense to the cause of action.” (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §
437c(p)(2).) 
A moving defendant may
satisfy the initial burden to show that one or more elements cannot be
established by “presenting evidence that conclusively negates an element of the
plaintiff's cause of action or by relying on the plaintiff's factually devoid
discovery responses to show that the plaintiff does not possess, and cannot
reasonably obtain, evidence to establish that element.” (Schmidt v.
Citibank, N.A. (2018) 28 Cal.App.5th 1109, 1119; Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 856 [it is insufficient for the
defendant to merely point out the absence of evidence.]; Gaggero v. Yura
(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 884, 891.) “The defendant must present evidence,
typically in the form of factually devoid discovery responses, showing that
plaintiff does not have and cannot reasonably obtain evidence to support his or
her claim.” (Ibid.) 
Unless and until a defendant
meets that burden, the plaintiff has no burden to present controverting
evidence. (Consumer Cause, Inc. v. SmileCare (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 454,
468 [“There is no obligation on the opposing party . . . to establish anything
by affidavit unless and until the moving party has by affidavit stated facts
establishing every element . . . necessary to sustain a judgment in his
favor.”].) If a defendant fails to meet that burden, summary judgment must be
denied, even if the plaintiff fails to file an opposition and fails to proffer
any evidence. 
On the other hand, if the
defendant “has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to
show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause
of action or a defense thereto.” (CCP § 437c(p)(2).) The plaintiff may not
merely rely on allegations or denials in its pleadings to show that a triable
issue of material fact exists, but instead “shall set forth the specific facts
showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to the cause of
action.” (Ibid.) “If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary judgment should
be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159
Cal.App.4th 463, 467.) 
 
IV.      
DISCUSSION 
Evidentiary Objections 
 
Parking
Concepts objects to the ASTM 1637-19 Standard, Exhibits C through H of
Philip Rosescu’s Declaration, the National Safety Council Data Sheet #597, and
the Institute of Transportation Engineers – Traffic Engineering Handbook. These
objections are not properly raised in a separate evidentiary objections
memorandum and are therefore overruled. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1354(b).) 
Defendant’s Burden 
Parking Concepts meets their
initial burden. 
Parking Concepts moves
for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s complaint on the following grounds: (1) the
alleged dangerous condition was so open, obvious, and avoidable that Parking
Concepts had no duty to warn or remedy the condition; and (2) Parking Concepts
had no notice of a dangerous condition. Therefore, Parking Concepts argues,
they did not owe Plaintiff a duty as a matter of law. (Notice of Motion, p. 2:
6-10.) 
The
elements of a cause of action for premises liability are the same as those for
negligence:¿duty, breach, causation, and damages.¿ (Castellon v. U.S.
Bancorp (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 994, 998.)¿Those who own, possess, or
control property generally have a duty to exercise ordinary care in managing
the property to avoid exposing others to an unreasonable risk of harm.¿(Annocki
v. Peterson Enterprises, LLC (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 32, 37.)¿If a dangerous
condition exists, the property owner is “under a duty to exercise ordinary care
either to make the condition reasonably safe for [customers’] use or to
give a warning adequate to enable them to avoid the harm.”¿(Bridgman v.
Safeway Stores, Inc. (1960) 53 Cal.2d 443, 446.)¿The existence and scope of
a property owner’s duty are legal questions for the court.¿(Annocki,
supra, 232 Cal.App.4th¿ at p. 36.)¿ 
Because
the owner is not the insurer of the visitor’s personal safety . . . the owner’s
actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition is a key to
establishing its liability.” (Ortega v. Kmart Corp. (2001) 26 Cal.4th
1200, 1206.) “[W]here the plaintiff relies on the failure to correct a
dangerous condition to prove the owner’s negligence, the plaintiff has the
burden of showing that the owner had notice of the defect in sufficient time to
correct it.” (Ibid.) The party asserting the cause of action has the
burden to prove that the owner had actual or constructive notice of the
dangerous condition in sufficient time to correct it.¿ (Ortega, 26
Cal.4th at 1203, 1206.) To establish liability for negligence, “[t]here must be
some evidence . . . to support the conclusion that the condition had existed
long enough for the proprietor, in the exercise of reasonable care, to have
discovered and remedied it.”¿(Girvetz v. Boys’ Market (1949) 91
Cal.App.2d 827, 829; Ortega, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 1206.) 
A
property owner owes no further duty to make a condition reasonably safe or give
an adequate warning of a condition when the danger of the condition is so
obvious that the condition itself serves as a warning.¿(Kinsman v. Unocal
Corp (2005) 37 Cal.4th 659, 673.) “[I]f the danger is so obvious that a
person could reasonably be expected to see it, the condition itself serves as a
warning, and the landowner is under no further duty unless harm was foreseeable
despite the obvious nature of the danger.”¿(Danieley v. Goldmine Ski
Associates, Inc. (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 111, 122.) Whether a condition is
obvious and whether the obviousness negates a property owner’s duty of care are
legal questions for the court.¿(See Jacobs v. Coldwell Banker Brokerage Co.
(2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 438, 446-450 [affirming a trial court’s granting of
summary judgment based on a finding that a dangerous condition was obvious].)¿ 
The
obvious character of the condition does not negate a property owner’s duty of
care to remedy a conspicuous danger when it is foreseeable that a person will
encounter the danger despite the danger’s obviousness. (Martinez v. Chippeqa
Enterprises, Inc. (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1185 [indicating a dangerous
condition encountered on a sole access way from the street to the defendant’s
building would not negate the defendant’s duty of care owed to the plaintiff];
see also Osborn v. Mission Ready Mix (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 104, 123
[finding an employee did not assume the risk of an obvious danger when the
employee’s employment required him to encounter a dangerous condition].)  
Plaintiff alleges that she
tripped over a parking block in a garage owned by Parking Concepts. (Parking
Concepts Separate Statement of Facts “PC-SSF” No. 1; Whitfield Decl. ¶ 4 Exh. 7
[Plaintiff’s Complaint].) The subject parking block was in a
disabled-accessible parking stall. (Ibid. at No. 2; Exh. 2 [photograph
of subject parking block].) At the time of the underlying incident, there was
no car in the subject stall. (PC-SSF No. 3; Exh. 6 p. 5:26-28, p. 6:1-2.) The
subject stall is outlined with 4-inch wide blue stripes and contains the
painted disabled logo as required by California Building Code, Title 24,
Chapter 11B. (PC-SSF No. 5; Exh. 1 [photo of parking stall].) The subject
parking block is painted blue and set 26 inches from the right front inside
stripe of the stall. (PC-SSF No. 8; Exhs. 1 and 2.) Between the front of the
subject stall and the parking garage wall is a 6-foot wide, blue-striped access
route to the garage’s exit. (PC-SSF No. 9; Exh. 1.) 
Parking Concepts alleges
that these facts show that the subject parking block was “open and obvious.”
Further, Plaintiff’s fall was captured on security video, which
shows Plaintiff had a plain view of the parking block. (PC-SSF No. 12;
Exh. 3 [notice of lodging of video]; Espana Decl. ¶ 2 [laying foundation for
security video].) The footage shows Plaintiff walking directly towards the
parking block. (PC-SSF No. 15; Exh. 3; Espana Decl. ¶ 2; Wolfe Decl. ¶ 6.)
Plaintiff turns around to look behind her, and when she turns back around, she
proceeds to trip over the parking block. (PC-SSF No. 17; Exh. 3; Espana Decl. ¶
2; Wolfe Decl. ¶ 6.) No obstacles prevented Plaintiff from walking around the
parking block. (PC-SSF No. 20; Exh. 3; Espana Decl. ¶ 2; Wolfe Decl. ¶ 6.)
Furthermore, Plaintiff was familiar with the parking garage as her parking pass
data shows she had used her pass on at least 65 separate days prior to her
fall. (PC-SSF No. 21; Exh. 4 [entry log]; Espana Decl. ¶ 3.) Prior to
Plaintiff’s injury, Parking Concepts had no reports of any incidents involving
the subject parking block. (PC-SSF No. 22; Espana Decl. ¶ 5.) 
                Parking
Concepts has set forth sufficient evidence showing that the subject parking
block was “so obvious that the [block] itself serve[d] as a warning.” Kinsman v. Unocal Corp
(2005) 37 Cal.4th 659, 673.) A reasonable person could have been expected to
see the parking block. Additionally, Parking Concepts provided evidence showing
that it had no notice or prior reports of the parking block’s dangerous
condition. 
                Accordingly, Parking Concepts
meets its initial burden. The burden now shifts to Plaintiff. 
 
Plaintiff’s Burden 
Plaintiff argues that (1)
the parking block’s dangerous condition was not open and obvious and (2)
Parking Concepts had notice of the parking block’s dangerous condition. 
First, Plaintiff argues that
the parking block’s dangerous condition was not open and obvious. Plaintiff
argues that, at most, only three seconds elapsed between when she looked back
and when she tripped over the parking block. (Plaintiff’s Separate Statement of
Facts “P-SSF” No. 35; Exh. 3 [security video].) She argues that, up to the
eight second mark, she did not see anything on the ground in front of her
because the blue parking block blended in with the blue driver side limit line
and access aisle marking. (P-SSF No. 37; Ehx. 4 [Kamar Decl. ¶ 10].) As a
result, Plaintiff argues the wheel stop was not open and obvious. However, upon
review of the evidence, the Court finds that the brightly colored wheel stop
stands out from the grey cement of the parking stall. Plaintiff has failed to
meet her burden on this ground. 
Next, Plaintiff argues that
Parking Concepts had notice of the parking block’s dangerous condition. Parking
Concepts conducted monthly inspections or walkthroughs of the premises. (P-SSF
No. 40; Exh. 2 [Alvarez Depo. 17:10-21, 48:6-19].) The subject parking block
had been in its location since at least 2018. (P-SSF No. 41; Exh. 2 [Alvarez
Depo. 43:5-21].) All the parking blocks at the subject parking garage are
off-center. (P-SSF No. 43; Exh. 2 [Alvarez Depo. 44:17-24].) Philip Rosescu
(“Rosescu”), Plaintiff’s retained safety and liability expert, is a licensed
professional civil engineer. (P-SSF No. 44; Exh. 3 [Rosescu Decl. ¶ 2].)
Currently Rosescu is a forensic engineer employed by Aperture, a forensic
engineering firm. (Rosescu Decl. ¶ 3.) In the past 15 years, Rosescu has
analyzed over 15,000 accidents. (Ibid.) Rosescu provides that industry
standards discourage the use of parking blocks as they cause pedestrians to
fall. (Rosescu Decl. ¶ 10; Exh. 3E [National Safety Data Council Sheet #597].)
Parking blocks should be inset from the limit lines of the parking stall to
assure that there is a free pedestrian walkway between cars. (Exh. 3H [Charles
E. Turnbow, Slip and Fall Practice].) If a parking block extends past
the vehicle, pedestrians are likely to trip on them. (Ibid.) Further, it
is industry standard to place parking blocks within the center of parking
stalls. (Exh. 3C [ASTM 1637-19, Section 9.4].) Here, it is undisputed that the
left side of the parking block abuts the driver side limit of the parking
stall. (P-SSF Exh. 2 [Alvarez Depo. 42:21-44].) Therefore, upon Parking
Concepts’s monthly inspections of the premises, and in light of industry
standards, Parking Concepts knew or should have known of the subject parking
block’s dangerous positioning. 
On
summary judgment, the opposing party’s affidavits or declarations are liberally
construed. (Corwin v. Los Angeles Newspaper Service Bureau, Inc. (1971)
4 Cal.3d 842, 851-852.) Therefore, Plaintiff meets her burden with evidence
showing a triable issue of material fact as to whether Parking Concepts knew or
should have known of the subject block’s dangerous condition. 
 
V.      
CONCLUSION
             A triable issue of material fact exists as to
whether Parking Concepts knew or should have known of the subject parking
block’s dangerous condition. Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for summary
judgment is DENIED. 
            Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
