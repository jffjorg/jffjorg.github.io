Her Guardian Ad Litem Eduardo Leyson, vs Soulcycle, Inc., et al.
 
Plaintiff Emma Leyson’s Motion for Relief
from Potential Waiver of Trial by Jury
 
Opposition: NONE
 
TENTATIVE RULING
            
Plaintiff’s Motion for Relief from
Potential Waiver of Trial by Jury is GRANTED.
            
BACKGROUND
            
On August 2, 2021, Plaintiff Emma Leyson (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Defendants Soulcycle, Inc. (“Soulcycle”), Rebecca
Ryan (“Ryan”), and Does 1 to 100 (collectively “Defendants”) alleging two
causes of action: (1) general negligence; and (2) negligent hiring, retention,
and supervision. Plaintiff alleges that, on September 15, 2019, Defendants
negligently yanked Plaintiff’s foot from between the pedal and handlebar of
Defendants’ stationary bicycle during an exercise class, causing Plaintiff to
sustain severe injuries.
 
On August 19, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant motion for order granting relief from potential waiver of trial by
jury.
 
On September 18, 2024, Soulcycle filed a
joinder and notice of non-opposition to Plaintiff’s motion.
 
A jury trial is set for November 25,
2024.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
“The right to a trial by jury as declared
by Section 16 of Article I of the California Constitution shall be preserved to
the parties inviolate.”  (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc., § 631(a).)  “In
civil cases, a jury may only be waived pursuant to subdivision (f).”  (Ibid.) 
CCP section 631(f) provides that a party waives trial by jury by (1) failing to
appear at the trial; (2) written consent filed with the clerk or judge; (3)
oral consent, in open court, entered in the minutes; (4) failing to announce
that a jury is required, at the time the cause is first set for trial, if it is
set upon notice of stipulation, or within five days after notice of setting if
it is set without notice or stipulation; (5) failing to timely pay the fee
described in subdivision (b), unless another party on the same side of the case
has paid that fee; or (6) failing to deposit with the clerk or judge, at the
beginning of the second and each succeeding day’s session, the sum provided in
subdivision (e).  (Ibid., § 631(f).) “The court may, in its
discretion upon just terms, allow a trial by jury although there may have been
a waiver of a trial by jury.”  (Ibid., § 631(g).)  “The trial
court should grant a motion for relief of a jury waiver ‘unless, and except,
where granting such a motion would work serious hardship to the objecting
party.’”  (Mackovska v. Viewcrest Road Properties LLC (2019) 40
Cal.App.5th 1, 10 [quoting Boal v. Price Waterhouse & Co. (1985) 165
Cal.App.3d 806, 809].)  “When there is doubt about whether to grant relief
from a jury trial waiver, the court must resolve that doubt in favor of the
party seeking a jury trial.”  (Ibid.)  
 
“In a motion for relief from waiver of a
jury trial, the crucial question is whether the party opposing relief will
suffer any prejudice if the court grants relief.”  (Mackovska, supra,
40 Cal.App.5th at 10.)  “‘The prejudice which must be shown from granting
relief from the waiver is prejudice from the granting of relief and not
prejudice from the jury trial.’” (Ibid. [quoting Massie v. AAR
Western Skyways, Inc. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 405, 411].) “‘The mere fact that
trial will be by jury is not prejudice per se.’” (Ibid. [quoting Johnson-Stovall
v. Superior Court (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 808, 811].) “Denying relief where
the party opposing the motion for relief has not shown prejudice is an abuse of
discretion.” (Ibid.)  
 
ANALYSIS
 
This action was commenced on August 2,
2021. Therefore, jury fees were required to be posted no later than August 2,
2022. (CCP § 631(c)(2)[requiring that, if no initial case management conference
is scheduled in a civil action, fees are due no later than 365 days after
filing the initial complaint].) Here, Plaintiff posted jury fees on April 25,
2023, about eight months past the statutory deadline.
 
Plaintiff does not proffer a reason for
the late posting of jury fees. However, while delayed posting of jury fees
constitutes waiver of trial by jury, it is “not a sufficient reason for denying
relief from waiver.” (TriCoast Builders, Inc. v. Fonnegra (2024) 15
Cal.App.5th 766, 782.) Therefore, the Court accepts Plaintiff’s late posting
for the purposes of CCP § 631(f).
 
Plaintiff argues that granting this
motion will not pose undue hardship on Defendants. Plaintiff claims that all
parties have been preparing for a jury trial. (Molchan Decl. ¶ 3.) Both
Defendants and Plaintiff have made jury trial demands and posted fees.
Furthermore, Plaintiff notes that trial in this matter is months away. The
Court also notes that Soulcycle joined in this motion.
 
Given the Court’s liberal policy of
granting relief from waiver of trial by jury, as well as Defendants’ lack of
opposition, Plaintiff’s motion for relief is granted.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff’s motion for relief from
potential waiver of trial by jury is GRANTED.
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
