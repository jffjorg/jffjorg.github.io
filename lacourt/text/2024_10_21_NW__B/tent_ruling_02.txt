Re:                         21STCV11343 Carlos Burgos vs Arthur M.
Danielian

 

 
Plaintiff Carlos
Burgos’s Request for Default Judgment
 
Defendant: Arthur M. Danielian
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff Carlos Burgos’s request for
default judgment is DENIED.
            
BACKGROUND
 
This action arises from a June 15, 2020,
motor vehicle accident in which Plaintiff Carlos Burgos (“Plaintiff”) alleges
Defendants Arthur M. Daniellian (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 100 (collectively
“Defendants”), negligently operating their motor vehicle, struck Plaintiff, who
was a pedestrian, and caused Plaintiff to sustain serious injuries.
 
On March 24, 2021, Plaintiff filed a
complaint against Defendants alleging two causes of action for: (1) motor
vehicle negligence; and (2) general negligence.
 
On October 27, 2023, default was entered
against Defendant.
 
On June 5, 2024, the case was reassigned
to the Honorable Karen Moskowitz in Department B at Van Nuys Courthouse East,
effective June 24, 2024.
 
On September 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant request for default judgment against Defendant.
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 585
permits entry of a default judgment after a party has failed to timely respond
or appear. (Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 585.) A party seeking judgment on the
default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a brief
summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support
of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a
memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration of nonmilitary status;
(6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment
is not sought or an application for separate judgment under CCP § 579,
supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary;
and (9) a request for attorney’s fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement
of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff’s default judgment packet
contains the following deficiencies:
 
1.     
Plaintiff failed to serve Statement of
Damages before default was entered. (CCP § 425.11(c) and (d).) In fact,
Plaintiff did not file a Statement of Damages at all.
2.     
Plaintiff failed to file Form CIV-100. (CRC
Rule 3.1800(a).)
3.      
Plaintiff fails to provide documentary
evidence to support amount of damages sought.
 
Therefore,
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment against Alexander M. Danielian is DENIED.
Plaintiff was put on notice at the last OSC on 8/30/24 that a third defective
filing risks dismissal for failure to prosecute under CCP § 583.410 and CRC
3.110(h). As such, Defendant Arthur M. Danielian is dismissed without
prejudice. 
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice.
