Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel non-party Dr. Lal to comply with a deposition subpoena for the production of business records. The defendant had issued the subpoena on May 13, 2024, and followed up with emails and a meet and confer letter, but Dr. Lal did not respond. The judge found that the defendant's proof of service of the subpoena was insufficient, and therefore the motion was procedurally defective. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the court's order.
