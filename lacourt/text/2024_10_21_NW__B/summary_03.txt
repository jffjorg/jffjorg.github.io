And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for relief from the potential waiver of trial by jury. The plaintiff was injured during an exercise class in 2019 and filed a complaint in 2021. The plaintiff then filed a motion for relief from potential waiver of trial by jury in 2024, alleging that the defendants had waived their right to a jury trial by failing to post jury fees in a timely manner. The defendants did not oppose the motion, and the court found that granting relief would not cause undue hardship to the defendants. The court cited California law and case precedent to support its decision, noting that the court has a liberal policy of granting relief from waiver of trial by jury and that the defendants had not shown prejudice from granting relief. The court ordered that the plaintiff's motion for relief be granted and that notice be given to the parties.
