MOTION:                  Motion
to Compel Deposition 
HEARING DATE:   3/19/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
Service of a proper deposition
notice obligates a party or “party-affiliated” witness (officer, director,
managing agent or employee of party) to attend and testify, as well as produce
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing for
inspection and copying. (CCP § 2025.280(a).) If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party deponent fails to appear, testify, or produce documents or
tangible things for inspection without having served a valid objection under
CCP § 2025.410, the deposing party may move for an order compelling attendance,
testimony, and production. (CCP § 2025.450(a).) The motion must be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration, or, when a party deponent fails to attend the
deposition, the motion must also be accompanied by a declaration stating that
the moving party has contacted the party deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance. (CCP § 2025.450(b)(2).) 
 
A motion to compel production
of documents described in a deposition notice must be accompanied by a showing
of good cause. (CCP § 2025.450(b)(1).) In other words, the moving party must
provide evidence (generally in the form of declarations) showing specific facts
justifying inspection of the documents described in the notice. Courts
liberally construe good cause in favor of discovery where facts show the
documents are necessary for trial preparation.
 
The motion to compel must be
“made no later than 60 days after the completion of the record of the
deposition.” (CCP § 2025.480(b).) This time limit also applies to motions based
on a deposition subpoena for production of documents or a business records subpoena.
The 60-day time limit runs from the date objections are served because the
deposition record is then complete. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co.
(2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1192.) 
 
Analysis
 

Defendants San Remo Ent., L.P., and
Dr. Bruce King move to compel the deposition of Plaintiffs Sybil Juni.  On December 11, 2023, Defendants noticed the
deposition of Juni, setting the deposition for January 12, 2024. The Notice
also sought the production of two categories of documents:
 
1. All DOCUMENTS that in any way
RELATE TO or mention DEFENDANTS or any
individual defendant described in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the
COMPLAINT.
 
2. All DOCUMENTS that in any way
RELATE TO or mention the SAN REMO
PROPERTY.
 
(Roth decl., Ex. 2.) 
 
Plaintiffs served an objection to
the notice on December 13, 2023, objecting to the location and unilaterally set
date of the deposition. The parties met and conferred throughout December but
did not resolve the issues. (Roth Decl., ¶ 9.) The deposition proceeded on
January 12, 2024, but Juni did not appear as noticed. (Id., ¶¶ 11-13.) In a
meet and confer effort, Plaintiffs reiterated their objections to the
Deposition Notice, and offered unspecified dates in late March or early April
2024 for the deposition. (Roth Decl. ¶ 12, Exs. 6-8.) Defendants took a
Certificate of Non-Appearance against Juni. (Roth Decl. ¶ 13, Ex. 9.)
 
Defendants establish that they
served a valid Notice of Deposition against Juni, and that Juni failed to
appear. Furthermore, Juni has not opposed this motion, and therefore failed to
justify her objections to the notice. Defendants provide evidence that the
objections are invalid. First, there is no objection to a unilaterally set deposition.
Second, Defendants show that the deposition was set to occur within 75 miles of
Juni’s residence. (See Compl., ¶ 1.) Thus, the objection to the location of the
deposition is baseless.
 
Accordingly, the motion to compel
is GRANTED.
 
Defendants request sanctions in the
amount of $5,000.00, for 10 hours of attorney time at a rate of $500/hr. Despite
counsel’s characterization of these hours as “conservative,” the Court finds
this requested to be an unreasonable sanction. (See Roth Decl., ¶ 19.) The
Court is inclined to award five hours for time spent taking the certificate of
non-appearance, drafting the moving papers, and appearing at the hearing for
this motion, plus costs associated with the certificate and motion. Accordingly,
sanctions are imposed against Plaintiff Sybil Juni and her counsel of record in
the reduced amount of $2,560.00, jointly and severally, and inclusive of costs.
Sanctions are to be paid to Defendants’ counsel within 30 days.
