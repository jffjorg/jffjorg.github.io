Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for sanctions brought by the defendants, Bastiat USA, Inc. and Bastiat Santa Monica, Inc., against the plaintiff, Jane Doe, and her counsel, Craig Charles. The defendants argued that the plaintiff's counsel failed to conduct a reasonable pre-filing inquiry into certain factual allegations contained in the complaint, specifically paragraph 71, which alleges that Rotondo's conduct caused BH's distress and attempted suicide.

The judge found that the evidence presented by the defendants did not establish that the plaintiff's counsel failed to conduct a reasonable pre-filing inquiry or that the allegations lacked evidentiary support. The judge noted that a reasonable interpretation of the plaintiff's text messages could include that she did not believe Rotondo's statements about BH, and that there was evidence that BH was not being truthful about her separation from Bastiat.

The judge also found that the record presented by the defendants was incomplete and did not provide a clear picture of the facts. The judge noted that there were disputes of fact regarding BH's alleged suicide attempt and Rotondo's abuse of her, and that these disputes should not be resolved in the context of a sanctions motion.

Therefore, the judge denied the motion for sanctions and concluded that the plaintiff has a sufficient evidentiary basis for the allegations in the complaint.
