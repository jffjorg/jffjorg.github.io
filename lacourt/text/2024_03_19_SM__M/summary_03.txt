Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' motion to compel the deposition of plaintiff Sybil Juni is granted. The defendants had served a valid notice of deposition on Juni, but she failed to appear at the deposition and did not oppose the motion. The judge finds that Juni's objections to the deposition notice were invalid, including her objection to the location and date of the deposition. The judge awards sanctions to Juni and her counsel in the amount of $2,560.00, to be paid within 30 days.
