And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jacobs v. Ritchie, in which Cross-Defendant Jassica Jacobs has demurred to the second amended cross-complaint (SACC) filed by Steven Ray Ritchie. The Judge has determined that the demurrer must be denied for several reasons, including procedural issues such as the failure to file proof of service and a memorandum of points and authorities. Additionally, the Judge has found that Jacobs relies on extrinsic evidence that is unalleged in the SACC and not subject to judicial notice. As a result, the demurrer is overruled, and Jacobs is ordered to answer the SACC within 10 days.
