ARMET ALARM & ELECTRONICS, INC., a Corporation; GENERAL MONITORING SERVICES, INC., a Corporation; and DOES 1-100 inclusive[TENTATIVE RULING ON DEFENDANT’S DEMURRER TO SAC]Moving Party: Defendant, General Monitoring Services, Inc. (Defendant, GMS, or General)Responding Party: Plaintiffs, Hilda Kasimian and Stepan KasimianRELIEF REQUESTED “Defendant, GENERAL MONITORING SERVICES, INC. (“GMS”), will and hereby does move this Court for an Order sustaining its Demurrer to the entire Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) of Plaintiffs, HILDA KASIMIAN AND STEPAN KASIMIAN (“Plaintiffs”).This Demurrer is made pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure §§ 430.10(e) and (f) on the grounds that the entire SAC and its first cause of action fail to state facts sufficient to constitute any cause of action against this demurring Defendant and because such cause of action is uncertain. Specifically, Plaintiffs’ entire action is time barred.This demurrer is made pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure §§ 430.10(e) and (f), and will be based on this Notice; the appended Memorandum of Points and Authorities; the Declaration of Benjamin Nachimson; the Request for Judicial Notice; the pleadings, records and files in this action; and such other materials as may be judicially noticed, or presented to the Court at or before, or in connection with, the hearing on this demurrer.”(Notice p. 1-2.)Procedural 16/21 Day Lapse (CCP § 12c and § 1005(b)): Ok Proof of Service Timely Filed (CRC, Rule 3.1300): Ok Correct Address (CCP § 1013, § 1013a): OkMoving Papers: Notice/Demurrer; Request for Judicial Notice; Nachimson DeclarationOpposition Papers: OppositionReply Papers: ReplyBACKGROUNDPlaintiffs, Hilda Kasimian and Stepan Kasimian filed their original Complaint on 11/22/2023.On 01/05/2024, Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) alleging three causes of action for: (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Negligence, and (3) Negligent Misrepresentation. All threecauses of action are alleged against both Defendants, Armet Alarm & Electronics, Inc. (Armet) and General Monitoring Services, Inc. (GMS or General).On March 8, 2024, this Court drafted an extensive tentative ruling on the demurrers to the FAC; however, the Court did not adopt the tentative and deemed the motions moot over the objection of counsel for Armet Alarm & Electronics.Plaintiffs filed the SAC on 3/26/2024.Movant’s demurrer was initially scheduled to be heard on 6/6/2024; however, on 5/29/2024, this Court reset the hearing for 6/7/2024.MEET AND CONFER A party filing a demurrer “shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) “The parties shall meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. If the parties are not able to meet and confer at least five days prior to the date the responsive pleading is due, the demurring party shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension of time within which to file a responsive pleading, by filing and serving, on or before the date on which a demurrer would be due, a declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a good faith attempt to meet and confer was made and explaining the reasons why the parties could not meet and confer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(2).)Failure to sufficiently meet and confer is not grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41(a)(4).)Defendant’s counsel alleges a meet and confer occurred, but an agreement was not able to be reached. (Nachimson Decl. ¶ 3.)DEMURRER LEGAL STANDARD A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda, (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.) The court “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law ….” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters; therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.30, 430.70.) The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)The general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts, not evidentiary facts. (Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) “All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter of pleading … is that his complaint set forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable precisionand with sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source and extent of his cause of action.” (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp. (1945) 26 Cal.2d 149, 156-157.)On demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to “determine whether or not the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any legal theory.” (Das v. Bank of America, N.A. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.) Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose of an entire cause of action to be sustained.” (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.) “Generally it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if there is any reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.” (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)Demurrer – Uncertainty A special demurrer for uncertainty, CCP § 430.10(f), is disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against him/her. (Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)ANALYSISPlaintiffs filed three causes of actions against Defendants – (1) breach of contract, (2) negligence, and (3) negligent misrepresentation.Defendant argues that all the causes of action are time-barred based on the contracted for statute of limitations found in paragraph 17 of Exhibit A that is attached to the SAC.Here, it is difficult to assess Defendant’s SOL arguments based on the uncertainty of the allegations in the SAC, and based on the confusing Opposition that Plaintiffs submitted.A special demurrer for uncertainty, CCP§ 430.10(f), is disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against him/her. (Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)The elements of a cause of action for breach of contract are “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 821.)A cause of action for breach of contract is subject to demurrer if “it cannot be ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is implied by conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc., §430.10(g).) A written contract must be pled verbatim in the body of the complaint, be attached to the complaint and incorporated by reference, or be pled according to its legal effect. (Bowden v. Robinson (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 705, 718.) An allegation of an oral agreement must “set[]forth the substance of its relative terms.” (Gautier v. General Tel. Co. (1965) 234 Cal.App.2d 302, 305.)Here, it is entirely unclear what contract, or contracts, the Plaintiffs are alleging they entered into with each Defendant in the SAC. Therefore, the first element of “existence of the contract,” is entirely uncertain.For example, Plaintiffs’ first cause of action for breach of contract on one hand appears to be alleging just one single contract based on ¶25 of the SAC because the allegations mention a single contract.However, the SAC references breaches of Exhibit A and breaches of Exhibit B.In order for the Court to assess Defendant’s arguments asserted in demurrer (and the confusing arguments in Opposition) Plaintiffs need to more clearly indicate if they are alleging a breach of one contract, or breaches of two different contracts.Plaintiffs also need to indicate which party or parties entered into which contract or contracts.Further, if Plaintiffs are attaching the contracts as exhibits to the complaint, they need to allege which exhibit applies for which contract.For example, as of now, the allegations in the SAC with respect to the first cause of action do not allege that General entered into any contract, or contracts, with Plaintiffs. Thus, Plaintiffs don’t allege the existence of a contract between General and Plaintiffs.TENTATIVE RULING Defendant’s demurrer to the SAC is SUSTAINED on grounds of uncertainty and failure to state sufficient facts. Plaintiffs do not allege the existence of a contract between Defendant and Plaintiffs.Further, many aspects of the first cause of action, with respect to both Defendants and Plaintiffs, are uncertain with respect to if this action is for breach of a single contract or breaches of multiple contracts, and which party or parties entered into which contract or contracts, and what the alleged contract or contracts are.Leave to amend is GRANTED.In light of sustaining Defendant’s demurrer to the SAC, the demurrer hearing set for 6/20/2024 is advanced to this date of 6/7/2024 and vacated in light of the fact that Plaintiffs will have to file a third amended complaint if they wish to proceed.Defendant’s request for judicial notice of Plaintiffs’ opposition to Defendant’s motion to strike portions of the FAC is GRANTED.Further, Plaintiffs are reminded of Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 797:In order to rely on the discovery rule for delayed accrual of a cause of action, “[a] plaintiff whose complaint shows on its face that his claim would be barred without the benefit of the discovery rule must specifically plead facts to show (1) the time andmanner of discovery and (2) the inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence.” (McKelvey v. Boeing North American, Inc. (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 151, 160, 86 Cal.Rptr.2d 645.) In assessing the sufficiency of the allegations of delayed discovery, the court places the burden on the plaintiff to “show diligence”; “conclusory allegations will not withstand demurrer.”(Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 808.)
