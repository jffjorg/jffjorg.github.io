Basis to Bring Motion for Attorneys’ Fees
Plaintiff
argues that CCP § 1033.5 specifies that it can bring this motion because
attorney’s fees are allowable as costs. Plaintiff also argues that Civil
Code § 1717 gives Plaintiff, as prevailing party, a right to attorney fees on
any claims based on the contract. 
Plaintiff attaches as Exhibit 1 to the Kim Declaration
the Indemnity Agreement in which Plaintiff succeeded on its motion for summary
judgment. 
In relevant part, the portion in Exhibit 1 that Plaintiff
cites to states:
To indemnify Surety against all losses,
liabilities, costs, damages, attorneys’ fees and expenses the Surety may incur
or has incurred due to the execution and issuance of the bond on, before or
after this date including any modifications, renewals or extensions of the bond
or the enforcement of the terms of this indemnity agreement.
(Kim Decl. ¶ 3 citing Ex.
1, ¶ 2.)
It appears, based on the
fact that there was no Opposition, and based on the code sections that
Plaintiff cited, that Plaintiff has shown a proper basis to bring this motion
for attorney’s fees and costs.
“The
following items are allowable as costs under Section 1032: Attorney’s fees,
when authorized by any of the following: (A) Contract. (B) Statute.
(C) Law.” (CCP § 1033.5(a)(10).)
 
CCP
§ 1032(a)(4) states:  “Prevailing party” includes the party with a net
monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a
defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a
defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against
that defendant. If any party recovers other than monetary relief and in
situations other than as specified, the “prevailing party” shall be as
determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the court, in its
discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed, may apportion costs between
the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under
Section 1034. (CCP § 1032(a)(4).)
 
Civil
Code § 1717 states:
 
(a) In any action on
a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and
costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to
one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined
to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party
specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s
fees in addition to other costs.
Where a contract provides
for attorney’s fees, as set forth above, that provision shall be construed as
applying to the entire contract, unless each party was represented by counsel
in the negotiation and execution of the contract, and the fact of that representation
is specified in the contract.
Reasonable attorney’s
fees shall be fixed by the court, and shall be an element of the costs of suit.
Attorney’s fees provided
for by this section shall not be subject to waiver by the parties to any
contract which is entered into after the effective date of this section. Any
provision in any such contract which provides for a waiver of attorney’s fees is
void.
(b) (1) The
court, upon notice and motion by a party, shall determine who is the party
prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section, whether or not the
suit proceeds to final judgment. Except as provided in paragraph (2), the party
prevailing on the contract shall be the party who recovered a greater relief in
the action on the contract. The court may also determine that there is no party
prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section.
(2) Where an action
has been voluntarily dismissed or dismissed pursuant to a settlement of the
case, there shall be no prevailing party for purposes of this section.
Where the defendant
alleges in his or her answer that he or she tendered to the plaintiff the full
amount to which he or she was entitled, and thereupon deposits in court for the
plaintiff, the amount so tendered, and the allegation is found to be true, then
the defendant is deemed to be a party prevailing on the contract within the
meaning of this section.
Where a deposit has been
made pursuant to this section, the court shall, on the application of any party
to the action, order the deposit to be invested in an insured, interest-bearing
account. Interest on the amount shall be allocated to the parties in the same
proportion as the original funds are allocated.
(c) In an action
which seeks relief in addition to that based on a contract, if the party
prevailing on the contract has damages awarded against it on causes of action
not on the contract, the amounts awarded to the party prevailing on the
contract under this section shall be deducted from any damages awarded in favor
of the party who did not prevail on the contract. If the amount awarded under
this section exceeds the amount of damages awarded the party not prevailing on
the contract, the net amount shall be awarded the party prevailing on the
contract and judgment may be entered in favor of the party prevailing on the
contract for that net amount.
 
(Civil Code § 1717 (a)-(c).)
 
Here, Plaintiff appears to be the
prevailing party based on the motion for summary judgment that was granted in
its favor on 2/23/2024.
 
CRC 3.1702(a)-(b)(1)

 
Rule 3.1702.
Claiming attorney's fees
(a) Application
“Except as
otherwise provided by statute, this rule applies in civil cases to claims for
statutory attorney's fees and claims for attorney's fees provided for in a
contract. Subdivisions (b) and (c) apply when the court determines entitlement
to the fees, the amount of the fees, or both, whether the court makes that
determination because the statute or contract refers to "reasonable"
fees, because it requires a determination of the prevailing party, or for other
reasons.
(Subd (a) amended
effective January 1, 2007.)
(b) Attorney's
fees before trial court judgment
(1)  Time
for motion
A notice of motion
to claim attorney's fees for services up to and including the rendition of
judgment in the trial court-including attorney's fees on an appeal before the
rendition of judgment in the trial court-must be served and filed within the
time for filing a notice of appeal under rules 8.104 and 8.108 in an unlimited
civil case or under rules 8.822 and 8.823 in a limited civil case.
 
Here, Plaintiff
did not address the timeliness of its motion. Plaintiff should explain at the
hearing how its motion is timely under CRC 3.1702(a)-(b)(1).
 
General Legal Standard - Lodestar and
Multiplier 
“A trial court assessing attorney
fees begins with a touchstone or lodestar figure, based on the careful
compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each
attorney involved in the presentation of the case.” (Christian Research
Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321 [internal quotations
omitted].)  “The reasonableness of attorney fees is within the discretion
of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration of such factors as
the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the experience and
expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved.  [citation] The
court may also consider whether the amount requested is based upon unnecessary
or duplicative work.”  (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th
443, 448.)  “The basis for the trial court's calculation must be the
actual hours counsel has devoted to the case, less those that result from
inefficient or duplicative use of time.” (Horsford v. Board Of Trustees Of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 395.) “The law is clear, however, that an award of attorney fees may
be based on counsel's declarations, without production of detailed time
records.”  (Raining Data Corp. v. Barrenechea (2009) 175
Cal.App.4th 1363, 1375.) “...[T]he verified time statements of the attorneys,
as officers of the court, are entitled to credence in the absence of a clear
indication the records are erroneous.” (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of
California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.)  The
Court has the discretion to reduce the amount of fees (or deny recovery
altogether) when the amount of attorney fees is inflated. (Serrano v. Unruh (1982)
32 Cal.3d 621, 635; Meister v. Regents of the Univ. of California (1998)
67 Cal. App. 4th 437, 455). 
 
In setting the hourly rate for an attorney fees award,
courts are entitled to consider the rate of “fees customarily charged by that
attorney and others in the community for similar work.” (Bihun v. AT&T
Information Systems, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal. App. 4th 976, 997 [affirming rate
of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin v. Watkins Associated
Indus. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 644, 664; see also Heritage Pacific Financial,
LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009 [“[R]ate determinations in
other cases, particularly those setting a rate for the plaintiffs' attorney,
are satisfactory evidence of the prevailing market rate.”].)    


The Court in Serrano IV also stated that fees
associated with preparing the motion to recover attorneys’ fees are
recoverable. (Serrano v.
Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 624
(Serrano IV).)

The
lodestar amount “may be adjusted by the court based on factors including (1)
the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed
in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation
precluded other employment by the attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of
the fee award.”¿ (Bernardi¿v. County of Monterey¿(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th
1379, 1399 [citing Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132].)¿ The
purpose of any lodestar and the increase thereto “is intended to approximate
market-level compensation for such services” and is entirely discretionary.¿
(Id.)¿ “The purpose of a fee enhancement is not to reward attorneys for
litigating certain kinds of cases, but to fix a reasonable fee in a particular
action.”¿ (Weeks v. Baker & McKenzie¿(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1171-72.)
“The trial court is neither foreclosed from, nor
required to, award a multiplier.” (Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of North America, LLC
(2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240, 247 citing Montgomery v. Bio-Med Specialties,
Inc. (1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 1292, 1297.)
Plaintiff’s Request
Plaintiff
requests attorneys’ fees in the amount of $16,504.44, plus costs of $1,346.06,
plus $487.50 if a reply to the opposition and an appearance is needed.
Plaintiff submits the declaration of Amber N. Kim. Kim
states that the total amount of fees incurred by and billed to ACIC for this
matter is $16,504.44. (Kim Decl. ¶ 13.) Problematic with this is that Kim does
not state how many hours this was based on.
Paragraph 12 of the Kim Declaration states different
billing rates for different attorneys that billed on this matter. Kim does not
state how much each attorney billed. 
Exhibit 3 to the Kim declaration appears to be the
billing statement, but this billing statement is difficult to decipher. 
TENTATIVE RULING
No
Opposition was submitted. The Court will hear argument about the reasonableness
of the attorney fees request, the costs of $1,346.06, and the additional $487.50
(to reply to the Opposition and attend the hearing). The Court notes that no
Opposition was submitted.
The Court will also expect to hear from Plaintiff
regarding why the motion is directed solely at one defendant.
Plaintiff should explain at the hearing how its motion
is timely under CRC 3.1702(a)-(b)(1).
