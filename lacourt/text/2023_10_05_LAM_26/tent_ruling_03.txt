  Case No.:  23STCV00433
 
  Hearing Date:  October 5, 2023
 
[TENTATIVE] order RE:
DEFENDANT KREGG KLEIN’S motion to strike
  portions of the complaint and Defendants HANCOCK AVENUE MAINTENANCE
  ASSOCIATION, INC. AND CALAMUS GROUP, INC.’S Demurrer and motion to strike portions
  of THE complaint
 
 



 
On January
9, 2023, Plaintiffs Robert Rosenbluth, Jeffrey F. Brotman as Trustee of the
2013 Robert Rosenbluth Trust filed the instant action against Defendants
Hancock Avenue Maintenance Association, Inc., Calamus Group, Inc. dba The
Standard Management Services, Kregg Klein, Jesse Clark, David M. Tarazona,
Danna Kinsky, Yael Kinsky, Ivan Kinsky, and Bruce Vanderhoff.  The complaint asserted eight causes of action
for (1) Breach of Covenants as Equitable Servitudes, (2) Breach of the
Governing Documents, (3) Breach of Fiduciary Duty, (4) Negligence, (5)
Nuisance, (6) Negligence, (7) Injunctive Relief, and (8) Declaratory Relief.  
On
April 12, 2023, Defendant Kregg Klien filed a motion to strike portions of the
complaint.  On May 11, 2023, Defendants
Hancock Avenue Maintenance Association, Inc. and Calamus Group, Inc. filed a
demurrer and motion to strike portions of the complaint.  These motions to strike and demurrer are TAKEN
OFF CALENDAR AS MOOT. Plaintiffs are entitled to amend at least once without
leave of court before the answer or demurrer is filed; or if a defendant files
a demurrer, no later than when the opposition is due on the hearing on the
demurrer.  (CCP § 472(a).)  Moreover, an amended complaint supersedes all
prior complaints.  (State Compensation Ins. Fund v. Superior Court (2010) 184 Cal. App.
4th 1124, 1130-1131.)  The amended
complaint furnishes the sole basis for the cause of action, and the original
complaint ceases to have any effect either as a pleading or as a basis for
judgment.  (Ibid.)  Since there is but
one complaint in a civil action, the filing of an amended complaint moots a
motion directed to a prior complaint.  (Ibid.) 
Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint on September 20, 2023 when an
opposition to Defendants’ demurrer and motions to strike would have been due.
 
CONCLUSIONS AND ORDER
The
Court finds that Plaintiffs properly filed a First Amended Complaint.  Accordingly, Defendant Kregg Klien’s motion
to strike and Defendants Hancock Avenue Maintenance Association, Inc. and
Calamus Group, Inc.’s demurrer and motion to strike are now taken off calendar
as MOOT.  
Moving
Defendants are to timely file and serve responsive pleadings.
By
operation of law, Plaintiff's filing of the First Amended Complaint has
reopened all previously entered defaults based on the original complaint.
Plaintiff
must serve the First Amended Complaint and amended summons on all named
Defendants.  For defendants who have
never appeared in this action, service of the First Amended Complaint and
amended summons by mail will be insufficient.
If any
defendant fails to timely file a responsive pleading following proper service
of the First Amended Complaint and amended summons, Plaintiff may seek that defendant’s
default on the First Amended Complaint.
            The Moving Parties are to give
notice and file proof of service of such.
