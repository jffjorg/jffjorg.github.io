And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motions to strike and demurrer filed by defendants Kregg Klein, Hancock Avenue Maintenance Association, Inc., and Calamus Group, Inc. However, since the plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint on September 20, 2023, these motions are now moot. The court finds that the plaintiffs properly filed the amended complaint, which supersedes all prior complaints. As a result, the motions to strike and demurrer are taken off calendar. The moving defendants are to file and serve responsive pleadings, and the plaintiffs must serve the amended complaint and summons on all named defendants.
