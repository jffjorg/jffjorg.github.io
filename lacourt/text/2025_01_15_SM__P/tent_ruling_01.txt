SM 10000 v. Chakchay, Case no. 24SMCV03946
Hearing date January 15, 2025
Plaintiff’s
Motion for Summary Judgment
Plaintiff
SM 10000 Property, LLC sues defendants Michael Chakchay, Georgio Chakchay and
Maya Haider for unlawful detainer arising out of $46,217.64 in unpaid rent and
fees. Plaintiff moves for summary judgment and offers the declarations of
counsel Isshu and general manager Browne. Defendants do not oppose. 
Pursuant
to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §437c(a)(1) a party may move for summary judgment in
any action if it is contended that the action has no merit. Pursuant to
§437c(f)(1) a court may summarily adjudicate causes of action. A motion for
summary judgment shall be granted if there is no triable issue of material
fact, and the record establishes that as a matter of law, the plaintiff cannot
prevail on a cause of action. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §437c(c). A defendant has
met its burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the party
shows that one or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established,
or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action. Once the defendant
has met its burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable
issue of material fact exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.
Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §437c(p)(2). In
unlawful detainer cases summary judgment motions may be made on five days'
notice any time after the answer is filed and shall be granted or denied on the
same basis as a motion under Cal. Code Civ. Proc §437(c). See also Code
Civ. Pro. §1170.7.
In
an unlawful detainer action, the landlord has the burden of proof as to all
essential elements of the prima facie case: (1) existence of a landlord-tenant relationship;
(2) the tenant’s wrongful occupation of the premises; (3) proper service of all
required notices; and (4) the tenant’s default in the payment of rent. See
Evidence Code §400; see also Ahlers v Barrett (1906) 4 Cal. App. 158,
160. A landlord-tenant relationship was created 3/20/24. Decl. Browne para. 5. Defendants
continue to wrongfully occupy the premises without the permission of plaintiff.
Decl. Browne para. 4. Plaintiff served the 3-day notice to quit 7/11/24. Id.
Defendants breached the lease when they failed to make payment in full for all
charges due, including rent. Decl. Browne exhs. 1, 2, 3. 
Plaintiff
demonstrated it is entitled to possession of the property and established the prima
facie elements of unlawful detainer. The burden of proof is shifted to
defendants to establish a triable issue of fact. Defendants have not opposed
the instant motion and have not provided any facts or evidence to meet their
burden; defendants cannot establish the existence of a triable issue of fact. 
Plaintiff’s
motion for summary judgment as to unpaid rent and fees in the amount of
$46,217.64, for unlawful detainer damages at a rate of $371.67 per day from 8/1/24
until the date judgment is entered, and for prejudgment interest in the amount
of $1,051.65 is GRANTED.
