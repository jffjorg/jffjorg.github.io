And here is the summary in English text:

In this tentative ruling, the court denies the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's physical examination without prejudice. The defendant's expert, Dr. Thomas Rosenbaum, had requested an additional physical examination of the plaintiff on February 27, 2024, but the motion did not specify the location of the examination. The court finds that the defendant did not meet the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.310, which requires a showing of good cause for the travel involved if the examination is to be held outside of the 75-mile radius of the plaintiff's residence. As such, the court must deny the motion. The court also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions, as the plaintiff failed to cite to any statute that would allow for sanctions in this circumstance.
