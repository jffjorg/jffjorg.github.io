And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment and grants it in part and denies it in part. The defendant's motion for summary adjudication is granted as to the negligence cause of action and as to any negligence cause of action under a vicarious liability theory under Government Code Sections 815.2, 815.4, or 820. The motion for summary adjudication is denied as to the causes of action for dangerous condition of public property and loss of consortium.

The judge finds that there are triable issues of material fact as to whether the location was dangerous due to various factors, including the first downed power line, the risk of other power lines going down after one goes down, and the severe winds. The judge also finds that there are triable issues of material fact as to whether the defendant had sufficient time to secure the location to prevent any incidents from occurring.

The judge concludes that the defendant is not entitled to summary adjudication as to the cause of action for dangerous condition of public property and loss of consortium, and that the case should proceed to trial.
