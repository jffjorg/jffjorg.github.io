And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for costs of proof sanctions. The defendant had propounded requests for admissions (RFAs) on the plaintiff, which the plaintiff denied. The RFAs asked the plaintiff to admit she had no facts to support her punitive damages claim against the defendant. The defendant's deposition testimony was consistent with her special interrogatory responses that the dog had never previously bitten or attacked anyone.

The judge found that the plaintiff's denials were unjustified and that the admissions were of consequence. The judge also found that the plaintiff had failed to provide any admissible evidence to support her denials, and that her own interrogatory responses were not sufficient to establish a reasonable ground to believe she would prevail.

As a result, the judge ordered the plaintiff to pay the defendant $1,958.45 within 30 days, which represents the reasonable expenses incurred by the defendant in proving the truth of the matters denied. The judge reduced the amount of the award from the original amount sought by the defendant, taking into account the fact that the defendant had spent excessive time on certain motions and that some of the costs were associated with an objection rather than a denial.
