And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The defendant, Sherwin-Williams Company, moves to dismiss the action for failure to serve within the three-year deadline. The plaintiff, Myranda Isabelle de la Cruz, argues that the lease agreement that was the basis for summary judgment was withheld by Defendant Mission Hills despite propounding discovery in November 2020. However, the court finds that the plaintiff had time to identify and serve the defendant by July 29, 2023, and that the purported withholding of a lease agreement between two different parties does not bear on the discovery of the defendant's identity. Therefore, the court grants the motion to dismiss.
