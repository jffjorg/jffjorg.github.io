The petition seeks to approve a compromise of the pending action involving Bradley Sugiharto, who is 17 years old and allegedly fully recovered. The Court denies the petition without prejudice due to several issues with the petition.

The Court also notes that the $189.95 in reimbursement sought by the petitioner is not indicated in the petition.
