MOTION
 
On July 29, 2020,
Plaintiff Myranda Isabelle De La Cruz (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against
Mission Hills Shopping Center, LLC, Angel de Jesus Hernandez, Maritza
Hernandez, and Does 1 to 100, inclusive, for injuries sustained on Mission
Hills’ property at 10321 Sepulveda Boulevard, Mission Hills, CA 91345
(“Premises”). Plaintiff alleges two causes of action for general negligence and
premises liability. Plaintiff alleges in the negligence cause of action that
she was struck by a vehicle while on the Premises. In her premises liability
cause of action, Plaintiff alleges she tripped on a pothole on the Premises. At
the time of her injury, Plaintiff was employed by B. Deirmenjian DDS, Inc.
which leased an office on the Premises. 
 
On September 12, 2023,
the Court granted Defendant Mission Hills Shopping Center, LLC’s motion for
summary judgment on the basis that the lease agreement signed between Mission
Hills and B. Deirmenjian DDS, Inc. contained a provision precluding liability.
On September 13, 2023, Plaintiff amended the complaint to add Sherwin-Williams
Company (erroneously sued as “The Sherwin-Williams Company”), as Doe 13. 
 
Specially appearing Defendant Sherwin-Williams Company (“Defendant”) now moves to dismiss pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 583.210 et seq. Plaintiff opposes and
Defendant replies. 
 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
Motion
to Dismiss
 
“A
defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or within any
further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and file a
notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes: . . . To dismiss
the action pursuant to the applicable provisions of Chapter 1.5 (commencing
with Section 583.110) of Title 8.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 418.10(a)(3).) 
 
“Notwithstanding
Section 1014, no act by a party who makes a motion under this section,
including filing an answer, demurrer, or motion to strike constitutes an
appearance, unless the court denies the motion made under this section. If the
court denies the motion made under this section, the defendant or
cross-defendant is not deemed to have generally appeared until entry of the
order denying the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 418.10(e)(1).) “Failure to make a
motion under this section at the time of filing a demurrer or motion to strike
constitutes a waiver of the issues of lack of personal jurisdiction, inadequacy
of process, inadequacy of service of process, inconvenient forum, and delay in
prosecution.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 418.10(e)(3).) 
 
Three-Year
Deadline to Serve 
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 583.210(a) states: “[t]he summons and complaint shall
be served upon a defendant within three years after the action is commenced
against the defendant. For the purpose of this subdivision, an action is
commenced at the time the complaint is filed.” “Dismissal is mandatory where a plaintiff fails to serve a
defendant within the statutory time limits. (§ 583.250, subd. (b).) The
three-year rule applies where the defendant seeking dismissal was served as a
Doe defendant named in the original complaint, later amended to show his or her
true name. [Citations.] In short, a plaintiff has three years from the date of
filing the complaint to identify and serve a Doe defendant.” (Inversiones
Papaluchi S.A.S. v. Superior Court (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 1055, 1061.) 
 
In computing the
time for service, the following condition is excluded: “[s]ervice, for any
other reason, was impossible, impracticable, or futile due to causes beyond the
plaintiff's control. Failure to discover relevant facts or evidence is not a
cause beyond the plaintiff's control for the purpose of this subdivision.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 583.240(d).) 
“The nature and
purpose of the three-year service of process statute (section 583.210) and the
statute of limitations are virtually identical. [Citation.] A statute of
limitations serves to promote the public policy of furthering justice by
precluding the assertion of stale claims. [Citation.] (Hennessey's Tavern, Inc. v. American Air Filter Co. (1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 1351,
1359.)  “The three-year service
requirement is ‘mandatory’ and is ‘not subject to extension, excuse, or
exception except as expressly provided by statute.’ (Code of Civ. Proc., §
583.250, subd. (b); [citation].) Further, we are strictly to construe ‘[t]he
excuse of impossibility, impracticability, or futility ... in light of the need
to give a defendant adequate notice of the action so that the defendant can
take necessary steps to preserve evidence.’ [Citation.] (State ex rel. Edelweiss Fund, LLC v. JP Morgan Chase & Co. (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 1113, 1120.)
“The question of
impossibility, impracticability, or futility is best resolved by the trial
court, which ‘is in the most advantageous position to evaluate these diverse
factual matters in the first instance.’ ” [Citation.] The burden of proof is on
the plaintiff, and we will not disturb the trial court's determination unless
the plaintiff also proves the trial court abused its discretion. [Citation.]
‘Under that standard, [t]he trial court's findings of fact are reviewed for
substantial evidence, its conclusions of law are reviewed de novo, and its
application of the law to the facts is reversible only if arbitrary and
capricious.’ [Citation.] (Id. at 1120–21.) 
Failure to discover the identity of a Doe
defendant does not toll the statutory period. (Code of Civ. Proc. § 583.240(d);
Republic Corp. v. Superior Court (1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 1253, 1255
[dismissal mandatory under previous statute where investigation and development
of a previously unknown witness uncovered the party who manufactured the
subject water heater]; see also Nelson v. State of California (1982) 139 Cal.App.3d 72, 77
[finding plaintiff failed to demonstrate an “adequate showing of diligence or
excuse for delay” because he had ample time to propound discovery to discover
the name of a Doe defendant.].)
If service is not
made within three years, then “[t]he action shall be dismissed by the court on
its own motion or on motion of any person interested in the action, whether
named as a party or not, after notice to the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
583.250(a)(2).) “The requirements of this article are mandatory and are not
subject to extension, excuse, or exception except as expressly provided by
statute.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 583.250(b).) 
DISCUSSION
Here, Plaintiff
filed her complaint on July 29,
2020. Therefore, the three-year deadline to serve was July 29, 2023. Plaintiff
did not amend the complaint to substitute Defendant for Doe 13 until September
13, 2023. (Morris Decl. ¶ 8, Exh. B.) Defendant was not served until September
22, 2023. (Id. ¶ 12, Exh. C.) As a result, Defendant was not served within
three years. 
Plaintiff has the burden. In opposition,
Plaintiff argues the lease agreement that was the basis for summary judgment
was withheld by Defendant Mission Hills despite the fact that Plaintiff
propounded discovery in November 2020. (Opp., 8) Plaintiff contends the lease
agreement was not produced until February 2023. (Opp., 4.) Therefore, Plaintiff
argues that because of this, service on Defendants was impossible,
impracticable, or futile beyond her control since she had no basis to realize
that Defendant’s lease agreement with Mission Hills contained a similar
provision. (Opp., 7–8.) Though Plaintiff cites law interpreting section
583.340,[1] section
583.240(d) explicitly states: “Failure to discover relevant facts or evidence
is not a cause beyond the plaintiff's control for the purpose of this
subdivision.” 
In addition, as
Plaintiff contends, she received the lease agreement in February 2023.
Therefore, Plaintiff had time to identify and serve Defendant by July 29, 2023.
Plaintiff has not set forth applicable authority that the time limit should be
tolled where she received discovery within the three-year time limit that could
possibly indicate Defendant’s liability. Finally, Plaintiff does not establish
that the purported withholding of a lease agreement between two different
parties bears on the discovery of Defendant’s identity. Based on the above, the
motion to dismiss is granted. Because the motion is granted, the Court declines
to address Defendant’s alternative motion to quash. 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendant Sherwin-Williams Company’s
motion to dismiss. The complaint as to moving defendant is dismissed with
prejudice.
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a
proof of service of such. 
 
 
PLEASE NOTE:   Parties are

a resolution may be reached.  If the
parties are unable to reach a resolution and a party intends to submit on this
tentative ruling, the party must send an email to the Court at sscdept32@lacourt.org indicating that party’s intention to submit.  The email shall include the case number, date
