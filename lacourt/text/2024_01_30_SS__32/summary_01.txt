Summary in English:

The tentative ruling is on a demurrer filed by the City of Los Angeles, acting by and through the Department of Water and Power (Defendant), to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) of Jason Abbott and Roxanne Abbott (Plaintiffs). The FAC alleges that the City's failure to regulate and treat the water at the Hot Ditch, failure to warn and protect against Naegleria fowleri, and failure to take other corrective action caused the death of Decedent Dutch Benjamin Abbott. The Defendant argues that the City's actions are immune from liability under Government Code section 855.4, which immunizes public entities and employees for injuries resulting from decisions made in the exercise of discretion to promote public health. The Court agrees that the FAC does not allege facts sufficient to show that the City's actions did not fall within the statutory immunity. The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.
