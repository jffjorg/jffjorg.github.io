The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Scott R. Lord's motion to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Keith Sidlo. This motion is denied as moot because Sidlo substituted out Lord and Golding + Lamothe as his counsel on October 1, 2024, and substituted in Ashley R. Fickel of Dykema Gossett LLP on October 25, 2024. As a result, Lord's motion is no longer relevant.
