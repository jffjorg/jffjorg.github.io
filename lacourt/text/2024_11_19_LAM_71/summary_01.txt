And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Husam Asi v. Hollywood Foreign Press Association, et al. (Greg Goeckner and James Lee). The Plaintiff, Husam Asi, has moved unopposed for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint (SAC) to address new facts and evidence discovered during the course of litigation, as well as to correct and enhance the legal theories and claims against the Defendants. The Judge has denied the motion without prejudice, citing that the Plaintiff's motion does not comply with California Code of Civil Procedure Rule 3.1324(a) as it does not include a copy of the proposed SAC. The Judge's ruling does not prejudice the Plaintiff's ability to re-file the motion or to seek leave to amend at a later date.
