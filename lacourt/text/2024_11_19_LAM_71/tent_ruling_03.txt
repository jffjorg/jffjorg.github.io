  Date:  November 19, 2024



 
Moving Defendant
Robert
M. Hindin, Esq.’s demurrer to Plaintiffs Abraham Ghorbanian DDS MS’s and
Ghorbanian, Saifee DDS, Inc.’s complaint is sustained with 20 days leave
to amend as to the 6th cause of action and overruled as to the 1st and 2nd
causes of action.
Moving
Defendant Robert M. Hindin, Esq.’s motion to strike is denied as moot. 
 
Defendant Robert M. Hindin, Esq. (“Hindin”) (“Moving Defendant”)
demurs to the 1st, 2nd, and 6th causes of action in Plaintiffs Abraham Ghorbanian DDS MS’s (“Ghorbanian”) and
Ghorbanian, Saifee DDS, Inc.’s (“GS Corp”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) first
amended complaint (“FAC”) on the grounds that (1) the allegations in Plaintiffs’
FAC fail to state any cause of action for fraudulent transfer, “damages for
fraudulent transfer” (aka civil conspiracy), and accounting; and (2) Plaintiffs’
FAC is uncertain.  (Notice of Demurrer, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §§430.10(e),
(f).)  Moving Defendant also moves to
strike portions of the FAC.  (Notice of
MTS, pg. 1; C.C.P. §§431.10, 436.)
 
Evidentiary Objections
Plaintiffs’ 11/5/24 evidentiary objections to the Declaration of
Mary Parks (“Parks”) are sustained as to Nos. 1, 2, and 3. 
 
Background
Plaintiffs filed their initial Complaint on December 7, 2023,
against Moving Defendant and Non-Moving Defendants Namazikhah DMD, Inc. (“PC2”);
M.S. Namazikhah D.M.D. (“PC1”); and Essential Endodontics, Inc. (“GC3”)
(collectively, “Defendants”).
On June 4, 2024, this Court sustained Moving Defendants’ demurrer
to Plaintiff’s Complaint as to the 2nd and 6th causes of action with 20 days
leave to amend.  (6/4/24 Minute
Order.)  
On June 24, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the operative FAC against
Defendants alleging six causes of action: (1) to set aside fraudulent transfer
of property; (2) damages for fraudulent transfer; (3) declaratory relief; (4)
judicial foreclosure; (5) appointment of a receiver; and (6) accounting.
This action arises out of Plaintiffs’ previous action, LASC Case No.
BC516805, against PC1 and Non-party M. Sadegh Namazikhah, E.M.D., M.S.,
Ed. (“Namazikhah”), from which Plaintiffs did not recover.  (FAC ¶¶15-17.)  LASC Case No. BC516805 concerned
the Agreement of Purchase and Sale of Business and Assets (“Dental Practice
Sale”) dated November 30, 2012, for the sale of PC1’s dental practice assets
including goodwill, to Ghorbanian PC controlled by Ghorbanian, for $600,000.  (FAC ¶16.) 
Plaintiffs allege that after the sale closed, PC1 wrongfully retained business
assets that were to be transferred, primarily interfering with the
patient-doctor relationship thereby taking the goodwill asset of the dental
practice causing damage to Plaintiffs.  (FAC
¶16.)
Moving Defendant filed instant demurrer and accompanying motion to
strike on July 30, 2024.  Plaintiffs
filed their oppositions on November 5, 2024. 
As of the date of this hearing no reply has been filed.
 
A.  
Demurrer
Summary of Demurrer
Moving Defendant demurs to Plaintiffs’ 1st, 2nd, and 6th causes of
action.  Moving Defendant demurs on the
basis that Plaintiffs’ FAC fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action for fraudulent transfer, damages for fraudulent transfer (aka
civil conspiracy), or accounting. 
(Demurrer, pg. 1; C.C.P. §430.10(e).) 
Moving Defendant demurs on the basis FAC is uncertain and ambiguous
because it fails to state sufficient facts to establish any claim against
Hindin.  (Demurrer, pg. 1; C.C.P.
§430.10(f).)
 
          Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring
party shall meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer. 
(C.C.P. §430.41(a), emphasis added.) 
A declaration must be filed with a demurrer regarding the results of the
meet and confer process.  (C.C.P.
§430.41(a)(3).)
Moving Defendant’s counsel declares that on July 23, 2024, she
telephonically met and conferred with Plaintiffs’ attorney, Kenneth J.
Catanzarite.  (Decl. of Park ¶4.)  Moving Defendant’s counsel declares that on
July 24, 2024, she received an email from Plaintiffs’ counsel stating that “the
parties had exhausted [their] meet and confer.” 
(Decl. of Park ¶8, Exh. E.) 
Moving Defendant’s counsel’s declaration substantially complies with C.C.P.
§430.41(a)(3).  Accordingly, the Court
will consider the instant demurrer.
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc.
(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A
demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable.  (See Donabedian v.
Mercury Insurance Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a
demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to
judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their
contents].)  For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the
reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital District
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
          Failure to State
a Claim
          Set Aside
Fraudulent Transfer of Property (1st COA)
Under the Uniform Voidable Transactions Act
(“UVTA”) (formerly the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (“UFTA”)), a transfer
made, or obligation incurred by a debtor is voidable as to a creditor, whether
the creditor’s claim arose before or after the transfer was made or the
obligation was incurred, if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the
obligation with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor.  (Civ. Code §3439.04(a)(1).)
“Under the UFTA, ‘a transfer of assets
made by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor, whether the creditor’s claim
arose before or after the transfer, if the debtor made the transfer (1) with an
actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud any creditor, or (2) without
receiving reasonably equivalent value in return, and either (a) was engaged in
or about to engage in a business or transaction for which the debtor’s assets
were unreasonably small, or (b) intended to, or reasonably believed, or
reasonably should have believed, that he or she would incur debts beyond his or
her ability to pay as they became due.’”  (Hasso v. Hapke
(2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 107, 121-122, internal citations omitted.)
Under Civil Code §3439.05 (constructive
fraud), a transfer is fraudulent as to a creditor’s claim arising before the
transfer if the debtor made the transfer without receiving a reasonably
equivalent value in exchange for transfer and the debtor was insolvent at the
time.  (Civ. Code §3439.05.)
Plaintiffs allege that faced with a Recorded Judgment by non-party
Kosmas Pappas a copy of which is attached as Exhibit “A” (“Pappas Judgment”)
which was recorded on July 6, 2017 by filing with the Secretary of State
against PC1, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit “B” (“Pappas Judgment Lien”)
as well as Plaintiffs’ LASC Case No. BC516805 Action, Namizakhah and Moving
Defendant hatch the plan and scheme to transfer PC1 assets without fair and
adequate consideration to GC3, all in an effort to avoid the Pappas’ Judgment
lien and Plaintiffs’ claims.  (FAC ¶25.)
Plaintiffs allege Moving Defendant had actual knowledge of the
Pappas Judgment and BC516805 Action including defending against claims related
to the value of the assets PC1 was to have conveyed to Plaintiffs and continued
pursuit of collection thereon and advised Namizakhah to pursue the fraudulent
strategy of a bogus transfer of PC1 assets to a new corporation that he would
form for that purpose.  (FAC ¶26.)
Plaintiffs allege that on September 15, 2017, Moving Defendant formed
GC3 as Secretary of State C4065440 by use of standard form Articles of
Incorporation using Namizakhah’s residence address of 661 Lachman Lane, Pacific
Palisades as a business address, yet signed by Moving Defendant.  (FAC ¶28, Exh. C.)  Plaintiffs allege the ARTS-GS Section of the
Articles of Incorporation states, “The purpose of the corporation is to engage
in any lawful act or activity for which a corporation may be organized under
the General Corporation Law of California other than banking business, the
trust company business or the practice of a profession permitted to be
incorporated by the California Corporations Code.”  (FAC ¶28.)
Plaintiffs allege as a part of this plan and scheme to defraud
Plaintiffs, on November 17, 2017, Namizakhah caused to be filed a Chapter 11
Bankruptcy petition for PC1 as case number 1:17-bk-13094-MB for PCl.  (FAC ¶29.)
Plaintiffs allege On June 5, 2018, the Chapter 7 Trustee for PC1,
Amy Goldman, filed a motion to approve a sale of all of PC1’s assets to GC3 for
$7,500 and attached an Asset Purchase Agreement signed by Namizakhah for GC3.  (FAC ¶31.)
Plaintiffs allege on June 13, 2018, Pappas filed his opposition to
the proposed sale of PC1 assets to GC3 taking the position that the sale was at
less than fair and adequate consideration designed to cheat PC1 creditors
including Plaintiffs.  (FAC ¶32.)  Plaintiffs allege on June 21, 2018, the
Chapter 7 Trustee withdrew her motion to approve the sale.  (FAC ¶33.) 
Plaintiffs allege thereafter on August 31, 2020, the PC1 bankruptcy case
closed without a discharge, meaning pending claims and liens would continue
against PC1.  (FAC ¶34.)
Plaintiffs allege at the Pappas judgment debtor exam held pursuant
to stipulation on May 21, 2021, Namizakhah falsely testified supported by Moving
Defendant’s speaking objections that he had sold all of the assets of PC1 to
GC3 at a price agreed upon with the Chapter 7 trustee of $7,500 and was
practicing dentistry through GC3.  (FAC
¶35.)  Plaintiffs allege this was the
first date on which Pappas learned that the assets of PC1 had been conveyed to
GC3 in an effort to defeat his judgment lien. 
(FAC ¶35.)
Plaintiffs allege as learned for the first time on May 21, 2021,
by Pappas, having failed in an attempt to insulate the PC1 transfer of assets
to GC3, Namizakhah and Moving Defendant, undeterred, made the transfer anyway
without court approval and without fair and adequate consideration paid by GC3
to PC1 and transferred the going concern value of the Namizakhah dental
practice assets, goodwill, contracts, receivables and work in progress to GC3
all with the specific purpose to hinder, delay and defraud both Pappas and
Plaintiffs.  (FAC ¶36.)
Plaintiffs allege they did not learn of the transfer of PC1’s
assets to GC3 without fair and adequate consideration until May 21, 2021, when
contacted by counsel for Pappas with questions about the BC516805 Action.  (FAC ¶37.)
Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that the transfer of
the assets including the going concern of PC1 to GC3 and Hindin discovered by
Pappas and Plaintiffs in May 21, 2021, was entered into by PC1 to GC3 for the
purpose of avoiding liability to Plaintiffs and to hinder or delay Plaintiffs
from executing on said property, and to hinder, delay and make it impossible
for Plaintiffs to access said property as a source of payment on the Pappas
Judgment, to avoid the related lien, to avoid liability in the BC516805 Action,
and to defraud Plaintiffs.  (FAC ¶39.)
Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that the decision to
make the transfers from PC1 to GC3 and Hindin was the result of discussion and
agreement between Namizakhah as a shareholder, director, and officer of both
corporations in conjunction with Hindin who was simultaneously counsel for
Namizakhah, PC1, and GC3, and the transfer was secretly effected without
documentation after the Pappas opposition to Trustee Goldman’s motion to sell caused
the motion to be withdrawn, all with the secret intention that no public
disclosure be made of the actual transfer.  (FAC ¶40.) 
Plaintiffs allege that as a result, Plaintiffs did not discover until
May 21, 2021, that the transfer had occurred if such a transfer was at all
effective given the prohibition that GC3 as a general business corporation
could not practice a profession.  (FAC
¶40.)
Plaintiffs allege that at the time Namizakhah and Hindin caused to
be transferred the going concern assets of PC1 to GC3 and Hindin, the fair
market value of same was in excess of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000)
while the secured debts were not greater than One Hundred Thousand ($100,000)
leaving Four Hundred Thousand ($400,000) of equity plus the cash transferred to
Hindin to satisfy the Pappas Judgment and a substantial portion of the
liability in the BC516805 Action.  (FAC
¶41.)
Plaintiffs allege that by virtue of the fraudulent transfer of the
assets of PC1 to GC3 and Hindin, Plaintiffs are entitled to an injunction
against the PC1, GC3, Hindin, enjoining and restraining any further transfer of
the assets and an injunction against PC1, PC2, GC3, and Hindin, enjoining any
further encumbrance of the assets and equity value thereof.  (FAC ¶42.)
Plaintiffs allege that by virtue of the fraudulent transfer of the
PC1 assets to GC3 and Hindin, Plaintiffs are also entitled to the imposition of
a constructive trust against the GC3 and Hindin’s assets such that PC1, PC2,
GC3, and Hindin hold the same in trust for the benefit of Plaintiffs as
requested in this complaint and an imposition of a constructive trust against
the proceeds of any sale or transfer thereof until all damages adjudged due
Plaintiffs in this action are paid in full. 
(FAC ¶43.)
Plaintiffs allege as a proximate consequence of the fraudulent
transfer, Plaintiffs have also been injured and damaged in an amount at
presently unknown, but subject to proof at trial.  (FAC ¶44.)
Plaintiffs allege a cause of action under UVTA.  Plaintiffs sufficiently allege actual intent
(FAC ¶26) and that PC1 transferred assets to GC3 and Hindin without fair
consideration (FAC ¶37).  Plaintiffs further
to allege that “the PC1 bankruptcy filing listed gross revenue for 2016 of
$486,000 which in context of ¶21 above that Namizakhah himself under oath
reported that PC 1 would pay him ‘ . . . $25,000.00 to $35,000.00 per month
. . .’ meant that PC1’s assets and income earning capability from practicing
dentistry was more than sufficient to allow PC1 to pay Plaintiffs in full,” and
that “[o]n June 5, 2018 the Chapter 7 Trustee for PC1 Amy Goldman filed a
motion to approve a sale of all of PC1’s assets to GC3 for $7,500 and
attached an Asset Purchase Agreement signed by Namizakhah for GC3.”  (FAC ¶¶30-31, emphasis added; C.C.P. §3439.04(a).)
Accordingly, Moving Defendant’s demurrer to the 1st cause of action
is overruled.
 
Civil Conspiracy (2nd COA)
“To support a conspiracy claim, a plaintiff must allege the
following elements: ‘(1) the formation and operation of the conspiracy, (2)
wrongful conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy, and (3) damages arising from
the wrongful conduct.’”  (AREI II
Cases (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1022.)
“Conspiracy is not a separate tort, but a form of vicarious
liability by which one defendant can be held liable for the acts of another. .
. . A conspiracy requires evidence ‘that each member of the conspiracy acted in
concert and came to a mutual understanding to accomplish a common and unlawful
plan, and that one or more of them committed an overt act to further it.’ Thus,
conspiracy provides a remedial measure for affixing liability to all who have
‘agreed to a common design to commit a wrong’ when damage to the plaintiff
results. The defendant in a conspiracy claim must be capable of committing the
target tort.”  (IIG Wireless, Inc. v.
Yi (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 630, 652, internal citations omitted.) 
A cause of action for conspiracy to commit common law fraudulent
transfer or violate the codified UVTA may be alleged.  (See Monastra v. Konica Business Machines,
U.S.A., Inc. (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1628, 1645; see also Berger v. Varum
(2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 1013, 1026.)
Plaintiffs allege PC1, PC2, GC3, and Moving Defendant agreed and
knowingly and willfully conspired between and among themselves to purport to
convert the otherwise available assets and equity in the PC1 which was
available to satisfy the Pappas Judgment and the claims in the BCS1680S Action
to an interest held by GC3 and Hindin exclusively with the actual intent to hinder
and/or delay Plaintiffs, and/or to defraud Plaintiffs.  (FAC ¶47.)
Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that Moving Defendant
had specific and actual knowledge of the Pappas Judgment and as defense counsel
in the BCS1680S Action claims and efforts to collect same against PC1 including
specifically that Moving Defendant knew about the objection to the Namizakhah
individual Chapter 11 plan followed by the PC1 bankruptcy and efforts to sell
PC1 assets to GC3, which he formed for the express purpose of fraudulent
transfers.  (FAC ¶48.)
Plaintiffs allege Moving Defendant owed Plaintiffs an independent
duty not to assist the fraudulent transfer of PC1’s assets to GC3, thereby meeting
the exception to Civil Code §1714.10.  (FAC
¶50.)
Plaintiffs allege as a result, they have suffered damages equal to
the amounts they have been unable to collect and will be unable to collect from
PC1 and PC2 without yet a further judgment against GC3 and Moving Defendant,
including for attorney’s fees, costs and other damages, in an amount according
to proof, but not less than $400,000, plus interest at the legal rate.  (FAC ¶51.)
Plaintiffs allege GC3 and moving Defendant had actual knowledge of
PC1’s wrongful conduct, as described above, to convert the otherwise available
assets and equity in PC1, which was available to satisfy both the Pappas
Judgment and the claims in the BC516805 Action to an interest held by GC3 and Moving
Defendant exclusively with the actual intent to hinder and/or delay Plaintiffs,
and/or to defraud Plaintiffs.  (FAC ¶52.)
Plaintiffs allege Moving Defendant had specific and actual
knowledge of course as defense counsel in the BC516805 Action claims efforts to
collect same against PC1, including specifically that Moving Defendant had
actual knowledge about the objection to the Namizakhah individual Chapter 11
plan followed by the PC1 bankruptcy and efforts to sell PCl assets to GC3 which
Moving Defendant aided and abetted PC1, PC2, and GC3 by providing substantial
assistance including forming GC3 for the express purpose of the fraudulent
transfer including PC1’s monies transferred to Moving Defendant.  (FAC ¶53.)
Plaintiffs allege due to GC3’s and Moving Defendant’s substantial
assistance, as described, Plaintiffs have suffered harm in the form of damages
equal to the amounts they have been unable to collect and will be unable to
collect from PC1 and PC2 without yet a further judgment against GC3 and Moving
Defendant, including for attorney’s fees, costs and other damages, in an amount
according to proof, but not less than $400,000, plus interest at the legal rate.  (FAC ¶54.)
Plaintiffs sufficiently allege a cause of action for civil
conspiracy.  Plaintiffs allege an
underlying cause of action for UVTA.  Plaintiffs
sufficiently allege the first element of conspiracy, the formation and
operation of the conspiracy: Moving Defendant knowingly and willfully formed
and agreed with non-party Namazikhah and his co-defendants PC1 and GC3 to
convert the otherwise available assets and equity in PC1 which was available to
satisfy the BC516805 Action to an interest held by GC3 with the actual intent
to hinder and/or delay Plaintiffs in the collection, and advised Namazikhah to
pursue the fraudulent strategy of a bogus transfer of PC1’s assets to the new
corporation, GC3, that Moving Defendant formed for the purpose of Moving
Defendant’s own financial gain.  (FAC ¶¶15-16,
26-30, 37-41,46-48, 51-53, Exhs. A, B, C.) 
Plaintiffs sufficiently allege the second element of conspiracy, wrongful
conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy: Plaintiffs allege that, consistent
with their plan and scheme, Moving Defendant formed GC3 on September 15, 2017,
after which Namazikhah filed for Bankruptcy for PC1, attempting to shield the
assets by inducing the Bankruptcy Trustee into an asset sale.  (See FAC ¶¶28-31.)  Plaintiffs allege this resulted in the Bankruptcy
Trustee filing a motion seeking approval of the sale on June 5, 2018, which was
withdrawn after Pappas opposed the sale. 
(See FAC ¶¶31-33.) 
Plaintiffs allege that, later, Namazikhah and PC1 transferred PC1’s “going
concern” assets to GC3 and monetary assets to Moving Defendant without court approval
and without fair and adequate consideration in an effort to defeat the Judgment
Lien and the BC516805 Action Claims.  (See
FAC ¶¶36-37.)  Finally, Plaintiffs
sufficiently allege the third element of conspiracy, damages: Plaintiffs allege
they suffered damages as a result of Moving Defendant’s malfeasance including
an inability to satisfy Plaintiffs’ BC516805 Action claims in an amount not
less than $400,000.  (See FAC ¶¶46-48,
51-53.)
Accordingly, Moving Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiffs’ 2nd cause
of action is overruled.
 
Accounting (6th COA)
Accounting is an independent cause of action in equity.  (Teselle v. McLoughlin (2009) 173
Cal.App.4th 156, 180.)  A cause of action
seeking an accounting may be maintained when (1) a relationship exists between
a plaintiff and defendant that requires an accounting, and (2) some balance is
due to the plaintiff that can only be ascertained by an accounting.  (Id., at pg. 179.)  No fiduciary relationship is required.  (Id.)  But “[a]n action for accounting is not
available where the plaintiff alleges the right to recover a sum certain or a
sum that can be made certain by calculation.”  (Id.)
Plaintiffs allege by virtue of the fraudulent conveyances herein
described and the obvious efforts with respect to the PC1 to GC3 transfer of
assets, PC1, PC2, GC3, and Moving Defendant have engaged in various
transactions with the intent to hinder, delay, and defraud Plaintiffs from recovering
on the Pappas Judgment and Plaintiffs on the BC5l6805 Action claims.  (FAC ¶66.)
Plaintiffs allege a judicial determination is requested for the
accounting of all the PC1, PC2, and GC3 transactions related to the Namizakhah
assets including without limitation the dental practice as of the date of the
filing of this Complaint given the diversion of funds from payments due to
Plaintiffs, and from PC1 when the PC1 to Moving Defendant transfer was first
purportedly entered.  (FAC ¶68.)
Plaintiffs allege a judicial determination is requested that PC1,
PC2, GC3, and Moving Defendant account for all transactions from May 2, 2013,
and any funds related to fraudulent transfers be adjudged and determined to be
held constructively as trustees for Plaintiffs. 
(FAC ¶69.)
Moving Defendant has no relationship with Plaintiffs that requires
him to provide an accounting of transactions of corporate entities.  Plaintiffs do not allege Moving Defendant is
an officer, director, or shareholder of PC1 or GC3.  Plaintiffs only allege Hindin represented
Namazikhah and PC1 as attorney of record in the BC516805 Action.  (See FAC ¶¶7, 26, 39, 48.)  This allegation is insufficient to create a relationship
between Moving Defendant and Plaintiffs.
Further, an accounting is used to determine how much is owed.  Plaintiffs attached the Stipulated Judgment to
the Complaint, which clearly states the amount owed by PC1.  (FAC ¶25, Exh. A.)  Additionally, the fraudulent transfer alleged
by Plaintiff is $7,500.00 worth of assets, which is a sum certain.  (FAC ¶31.)  The underlying contract in the BC516805 Action
is valued at $600,000.00.  (FAC ¶16.)  Plaintiffs allege $400,000.00 of “equity”
belongs to PC1 to satisfy a “substantial portion of liability in the BC516805
Action.” (FAC ¶41.)  Based on these allegations,
an accounting is unnecessary.
Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiffs’ 6th cause of
action is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
Uncertainty
A demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the
complaint is so bad that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., he or she
cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what
counts or claims are directed against him or her.  (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
If the complaint contains enough facts to apprise defendant of the
issues it is being asked to meet, failure to label each cause of action is not
ground for demurrer: “Although inconvenient, annoying and inconsiderate, the
lack of labels . . . does not substantially impair [defendant’s] ability to
understand the complaint.” (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986)
185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139 n.2.)
Plaintiffs’ causes of action are not so uncertain that Moving
Defendant cannot reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied,
or what counts or claims are directed against him or her.  (Khoury, 14 Cal.App.4th at pg. 616.)
Accordingly, Moving Defendant’s demurrer on the basis of
uncertainty is overruled.          
 
Conclusion
Moving Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiffs’ Complaint is sustained
with 20 days leave to amend as to the 6th cause of action and overruled as
to the 1st and 2nd causes of action.
Moving Party to give notice.
 
B.   
Motion to Strike
In
light of the Court’s ruling on the demurrer, Moving Defendant’s motion to
strike is denied as moot.
