 Hearing Date:  November 19, 2024



 
Plaintiff Husam Asi’s, in pro per, unopposed motion
for leave to file a second amended complaint is denied, without prejudice.
 
          Plaintiff Husam
Asi (“Asi”) (“Plaintiff”), in pro per, moves unopposed
for an order granting him leave to file a second amended complaint (“SAC”) on
the grounds that the proposed amendments are necessary to address new facts and
evidence discovered during the course of litigation, as well as to correct and
enhance the legal theories and claims against the Defendants, and that the
amendments will not prejudice the Defendants. 
(Notice of Motion, pg. 2;
C.C.P. §§473(a)(1), 576.)
          
          Procedural
Background
Plaintiff filed his Complaint on May 11, 2022, against
Defendants Hollywood Foreign Press Association (“HFPA”), Greg Goeckner
(“Goekner”), and James Lee (“Lee”) (collectively, “Defendants”).  Plaintiff filed the operative first amended
complaint (“FAC”) on April 22, 2024, against Defendants alleging eleven causes
of action: (1)
breach of contract [alleged against HFPA]; (2) breach of implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing [alleged against HFPA]; (3) tortious interference
with contractual relations [alleged against HFPA]; (4) tortious interference
with prospective economic advantage [alleged against HFPA]; (5) violation of
Business & Professions Code §§1700 et seq. [alleged against HFPA]; (6)
intentional infliction of emotional distress [alleged against HFPA]; (7)
violation of the California Right of Fair Procedure [alleged against HFPA]; (8)
constructive/retaliatory discharge in violation of public policy [alleged
against HFPA]; (9) harassment and discrimination on the basis of race, national
origin, and/or color in violation of FEHA [alleged against HFPA]; (10) violation
of FEHA- failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, and retaliation
[alleged against HFPA]; and (11) retaliation for engaging in protected activity
[alleged against HFPA].  (See FAC.)
          Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on August 8, 2024. 
Defendant HFPA filed its notice of non-opposition on November 5, 2024.
 
          Motion for Leave to Amend
“The
court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow
a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name
of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake
in any other respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or
demurrer. The court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the
adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any
pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms allow an
answer to be made after the time limited by this code.”  (C.C.P.
§473(a)(1).) 
“Trial
courts are vested with the discretion to allow amendments to pleadings ‘in
furtherance of justice.’ That trial courts are to liberally permit such
amendments, at any stage of the proceeding, has been established policy in this
state since 1901.”  (Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d
486, 488-489.) 
CRC
Rule 3.1321(a) requires that a motion to amend must: “[i]nclude a copy of the proposed . . . amended pleading .
. . [and] state what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be
[deleted and/or added], if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number,
the [deleted and/or additional] allegations are located.”  (CRC Rule
3.1321(a), emphasis added.)
CRC
Rule 3.1324(b) provides, as follows: “[a] separate declaration must accompany
the motion and must specify: (1) [t]he effect of the amendment; (2) [w]hy the
amendment is necessary and proper; (3) [w]hen the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered; and (4) [t]he reasons why the request for
amendment was not made earlier.” 
Plaintiff’s
motion does not comply with CRC Rule 3.1324(a).  The motion does not include
a copy of the proposed SAC.
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend his FAC and file a SAC is denied, without
prejudice.  
 
          Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
unopposed motion for leave to amend his FAC and file a SAC is denied,
without prejudice.
          Moving Party to give notice.
