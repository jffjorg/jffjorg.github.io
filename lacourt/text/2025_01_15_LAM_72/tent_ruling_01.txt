Plaintiff and Defendant E.H. Butland Corp. (“Butland”) moves
to compel Plaintiff and Defendant Hamilton Brothers Construction, Inc.
(“Hamilton”) to provide further responses to Butland’s Special Interrogatories,
Set Two, Nos. 26, 38, 43, 48, 53, 58, and 63.
 
The Court GRANTS Butland’s motion.  Hamilton shall provide full and complete
responses to these Special Interrogatories within 10 days.
 
The parties have waived sanctions. The Court does not grant
sanctions.
 
Background
 
This is a construction dispute where Butland, a general
contractor, contends that Hamilton, a subcontractor, overbilled it for work
performed on a construction project.
 
Butland is the general contractor for the Cheder Girls
School construction project, located at 100 South La Brea Avenue, Los Angeles
(the “Project”). Hamilton entered into a contract with Butland to drill and
construct 93 concrete foundation piles as well as the structural concrete,
slab-on-grade, and light concrete work for the Project. 
 
Hamilton initially contracted to complete 93 piles for
$295,000.00. Butland contends that Hamilton completed only seven of the piles –
less than 8 percent of the work – before being terminated. Butland contends
that Hamilton was terminated for cause; Hamilton contends that it was
terminated for Butland’s convenience.
 
Before it was terminated, Hamilton submitted two invoices to
Butland; the first indicated that Hamilton had completed 53.07 percent of its
work on the foundation piles and its second indicated that it had completed
various percentages of various change orders.
 
This case was filed on November 9, 2022 by Plaintiff Paco
Ventures, LLC (“Paco Ventures”) against Hamilton and Butland. Paco Ventures has
since settled its claims.
 
On December 1, 2022, Hamilton filed a complaint in this
action against Butland and 100 S. La Brea, LLC for (1) breach of contract; (2)
quantum meruit; and (3) foreclosure of mechanic’s lien.
 
On December 12, 2022, Butland filed a complaint in this
action against Hamilton for (1) breach of contract; (2) negligence; (3) common
count; and (4) unjust enrichment.
 
On November 5, 2024, Butland served the discovery at issue.
Hamilton responded on December 9, 2024. Counsels for the parties met and
conferred from December 16, 2024 to December 23, 2024.
 
On December 31, 2024, Butland filed this motion.
 
On January 10, 2025, the Court granted Butland’s ex parte
application to advance the hearing date on this motion to January 15, 2025 so
that it could be heard before the approaching trial date of February 3, 2025. The
parties agreed that the motion would be heard notwithstanding that it was past
the discovery cutoff date. The parties also agreed to waive sanctions. The
Court ordered that Hamilton’s opposition would be due by January 13, 2024.
 
On January 13, 2024, Hamilton filed an opposition. 
 
Discussion
 
            Each
of the interrogatories at issue asks Hamilton to support state all facts in
support of its             contentions
that it had completed certain percentages of the original project and change
orders by May 20, 2022 and June 15, 2022, if Hamilton so contends. (See
generally, Butland Separate Statement.) Hamilton provided short, conclusory
responses to each, stating essentially that it had expended those percentages
of the time, labor, and costs that it expected to expend. (See generally,
Butland Separate Statement.)
 
            Butland
argues that these responses do not adequately state facts supporting the
contentions. Hamilton contends that it has already disclosed all of the
underlying facts regarding the work to Butland in previous discovery in this
case, and that these interrogatories only serve to seek Butland’s legal
theories for trial.
 
            The
responses do not adequately state responsive facts. The parties agree that
there is a wealth of underlying facts missing from the responses, and only
dispute whether they need to be stated. The Court agrees with Butland’s
position. While the underlying facts may have been previously disclosed,
Butland is within its rights to ask Hamilton which facts support its positions
that it had completed the percentages of work that it claimed on its invoices.
If these facts have already been exchanged in discovery, then the burden of
aggregating them into one set of responses should be less than it otherwise
would be.  Accordingly, the Court grants
the motion.
