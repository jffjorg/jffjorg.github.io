And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the petition to confirm the arbitration award to a date to be determined at a hearing. The moving party, Petitioner Supercluster, Inc., has filed a petition to confirm the arbitration award, while the responding parties, Respondents BMW of North America, LLC, and An Luxury Imports of San Diego, Inc., have filed an opposition to the petition. The parties arbitrated the dispute before the Honorable Raymond J. Ikola (Ret.) and the arbitrator awarded Petitioner $178,766.00 against Defendant BMW North America, LLC. The Respondents opposed the petition, arguing that it is premature, but the judge finds that they are still within the 100-day timeline to file their own separate petition to vacate the award. The judge orders that the petition to confirm the arbitration award be continued to a future hearing date, and expects the Respondents to timely file and serve a petition to vacate the award.
