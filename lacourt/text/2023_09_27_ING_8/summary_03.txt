And here is a brief English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled on a demurrer filed by the defendants, who are challenging the validity of the plaintiffs' claims. The judge has overridden the demurrer, finding that the plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to support their claims of breach of contract, intentional interference with contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and interference with prospective economic advantage. However, the judge has granted the defendants' motion to strike the additional causes of action and new party defendant added to the pleadings without prior leave of court.

  - The Court finds that Defendants had knowledge of the economic relationship between Plaintiff Muldrow and Tolliver.

  - The Court finds that Plaintiffs failed to follow proper procedure necessary to add the new causes of action and new party defendant to the Second Amended Complaint.
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants. The demurrer is an objection to the sufficiency of the plaintiff's complaint, while the motion to strike seeks to remove certain allegations or parties from the complaint.

The judge has overruled the demurrer as to the first and second causes of action, which allege breach of contract and breach of contract - third party beneficiary liability, respectively. The judge found that the plaintiffs have adequately pleaded their claims and that the defendants' objections were without merit.

The judge has also granted the motion to strike as to the third, fourth, sixth through ninth causes of action and the addition of a new party defendant, Greer Jones, Trustee of the Greer Jones Family Trust. The judge found that the plaintiffs failed to obtain leave of court to add the new causes of action and party defendant to the Second Amended Complaint.

The judge has given notice to the parties of the ruling and has ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the ruling unless notice is waived.
