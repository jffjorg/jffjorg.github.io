```

And here is a brief English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled on a demurrer filed by the defendants, who are challenging the validity of the plaintiffs' claims. The judge has overridden the demurrer, finding that the plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to support their claims of breach of contract, intentional interference with contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and interference with prospective economic advantage. However, the judge has granted the defendants' motion to strike the additional causes of action and new party defendant added to the pleadings without prior leave of court.
