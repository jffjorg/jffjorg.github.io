And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denied the defendant's motion for sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel. The defendant sought $6,000 in sanctions for the plaintiff's failure to appear for a mandatory settlement conference (MSC) on May 26, 2024. The plaintiff argued that the MSC was rendered ineffective by the defendant's disclosure that no authorized representative would be present. The court found that the defendant's inconsistent representations about its authority to settle the case and its refusal to stipulate to a continuance of the conference contributed to the plaintiff's failure to appear. The court also noted that the MSC was court-ordered and could not be continued by the parties except by their stipulation. The court concluded that sanctions were not appropriate against the defendant and denied the motion for sanctions.
