And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the motion to disqualify Kenneth Chiate and Quinn Emanuel. The motion was filed by the defendants, who alleged that Chiate had violated Rule 4.2 by communicating directly with Michael Bakhshi, a defendant, without an attorney present. The Judge found that even if Chiate did violate Rule 4.2, there was no evidence that any confidential information was disclosed to Chiate, and disqualification was not necessary to preserve the integrity of the judicial process. The Judge also found that the delay in filing the motion was unreasonable, having waited one year after the filing of the Fourth Amended Complaint. The Judge concluded that disqualification was unwarranted because there was no threat of ongoing harm to the proceedings, and the defendants had waived their right to move for disqualification.
