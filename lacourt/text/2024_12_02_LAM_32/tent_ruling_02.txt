     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion to tax costs




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On August 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed
this legal malpractice action against Defendants Bobby Babak Saadian and
Wilshire Law Firm, PLC. Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint
on December 6, 2022, asserting causes of action for (1) legal malpractice, (2)
breach of fiduciary duty, and (3) fraud. The third cause of action was stricken
by demurrer. 
            On October 9, 2024, the Court
granted Defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the remaining claims. 
            On October 15, 2024, the Court
granted judgment in favor of Defendants and awarded Defendants costs. 
            On October 16, 2024, Defendants
filed a Memorandum of Costs (MOC) totaling $10,642.64. 
            On October 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to tax costs. Defendants filed their opposition on November
18, 2024. 
LEGAL STANDARD
The statutory scheme for cost recovery
establishes three categories of trial preparation expenses: (1) one category
allowable as a matter of right to the prevailing party (Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5(a)); (2) one category disallowable unless expressly authorized elsewhere
by law (id., subd. (b)); and (3) one category allowable or disallowable
in the court’s discretion (id., subd. (c)(4)). Even where costs are
deemed allowable, such costs are only recoverable to the extent that they are
(1) reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely
convenient or beneficial to its preparation and (2) reasonable in amount. (Id.,
subd. (c)(2)-(3).)
“If the items appearing in a cost bill
appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to
show that they were not reasonable or necessary. On the other hand, if the
items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof
is on the party claiming them as costs.” (Sanford v. Rasnick (2016) 246
Cal.App.4th 1121, 1128.) 
DISCUSSION
I.
Filing and Motion Fees
            Filing and motion fees are expressly
allowed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(1).) Defendants claim filing and motion
fees of $2,018.45. Attachment 1(G) of the MOC details the filings for which
Defendants claim fees. The Court finds the filings to be properly related to
the litigation.
            Defendants claim that they
erroneously left out $440.55 from the claim for filing fees, and seek total
filing costs of $2,459. (Cole Decl. ¶ 5.) However, Defendants cannot obtain
costs not listed in the MOC. Thus, while the Court does not strike any of the
listed costs, it also does not add any costs. Defendants are entitled to
$2,018.45 in filing fees.   
II.
Deposition Costs
            The cost of “[t]aking, video
recording, and transcribing necessary depositions” is expressly allowed. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(a)(3).) Defendants claim $569.75 for the deposition of
Peter Cho and $2,774.90 for the deposition of Plaintiff, for a total of
$3,344.65. The Court finds that these costs were reasonably incurred and necessary.

III.
Models, Enlargements, and Photocopies
            The MOC claims costs for models,
enlargements, and photocopies of $423.75. Defendants concede that these costs
were included in error. (Cole Decl. ¶ 5.) Thus, the costs are stricken. 
IV.
Electronic Filing and Service
            The MOC claims $749.38 for
electronic service or filing. Defendants concede these costs were included in
error. (Cole Decl. ¶ 5.) Thus, these costs are stricken. 
V.
Other
            The MOC claims $4,106.41 in “Other”
costs. Defendants concede that these costs were included in error. (Cole Decl.
¶ 5.) Thus, the costs are stricken.  
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion to tax costs is
GRANTED in the amount of $5,279.54 ($423.75 + $749.38 + $4,106.41).
