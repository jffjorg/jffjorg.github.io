Significant Statements:

  - "An employer's failure to take adequate security measures despite a known risk of harm may be reprehensible, justifying a 50 percent penalty under the workers' compensation law for serious and willful misconduct (Labor Code ยง 4553), but it invokes no fundamental public policy that we can discern." (Citations)
  - "Liability under section 3602, subdivision (b)(1), must be based on positive misconduct by the employer and not on a theory of vicarious liability such as that which forms the basis of the doctrine of respondeat superior." (Fretland v. Cnty. of Humboldt (1999) 69 Cal. App. 4th 1478)
