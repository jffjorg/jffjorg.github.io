English-text summary:

The judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for determination of good faith settlement in the case of Nima Sajjadi, Sima Nobahar, and The Estate of Mahmood Sajjadi (Plaintiffs) vs. Dr. Robert Khorramian, Dr. Ellie Goldstein, and The Rehabilitation Centre of Beverly Hills (Defendants). The Plaintiffs filed a wrongful death action against the defendants for medical malpractice. The defendants, who are also the defendants' insurers, have settled the case for an undisclosed amount. The Centre has moved for a determination of good faith settlement, which has been unopposed. The judge finds that the Centre has sufficiently addressed the Tech-Bilt factors to show that the settlement was made in good faith. The motion is therefore granted.
