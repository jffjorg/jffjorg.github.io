Here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) against the complaint filed by Kayden Vinovich, a minor. The complaint alleges that LAUSD and Creative Kids, a social and educational program, were negligent in supervising Kayden during an after-school activity at Chatsworth Park. The judge has sustained LAUSD's demurrer, meaning that the complaint does not sufficiently state a cause of action against LAUSD. The judge has also granted LAUSD's motion to strike certain provisions of the complaint, including references to Education Code §44807, California Government Code §815.6, and California Code of Regulations §§5531 and 5552. The judge has given the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint to cure the deficiencies.
