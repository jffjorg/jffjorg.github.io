And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling is regarding the motions to compel discovery and sanctions between the Plaintiffs, Monica Garcia and Genaro Santillian, and the Defendant, Michael Kenneth Piwowar, ET AL. The Defendant had served set one of form interrogatories and request for production of documents on November 21, 2023, and the responses were due on December 26, 2023. However, the Plaintiffs did not serve responses until February 24, 2024. The Defendant sought sanctions in the amount of $522 for each motion to compel. The Court finds that the motions to compel are moot in light of the responses served prior to the hearing. The Court will award reduced monetary sanctions since the Defendant has already obtained the discovery responses sought, albeit late. The Defendant is awarded 1 hour for each motion to compel at the requested rate of $185 per hour, and four motion filing fees of $60. The Court imposes sanctions in the total amount of $980 against the Plaintiffs' and Plaintiffs' attorney of record, jointly and severally.
