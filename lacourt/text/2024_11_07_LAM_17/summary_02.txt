And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration in this case. The plaintiff, Lester Mayorga, brought a lawsuit against the defendant, Tesla, Inc., alleging that the 2021 Tesla Model 3 he purchased was defective. The defendant argued that the dispute should be resolved through arbitration, rather than litigation. The court found that the plaintiff signed a Motor Vehicle Order Agreement and a Retail Installment Sale Contract, both of which contained arbitration provisions. The court concluded that the arbitration agreements were valid and enforceable under both California and federal law. Therefore, the court granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stayed the judicial proceedings pending the completion of the arbitration.
