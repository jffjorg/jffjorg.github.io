And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiff's motion to vacate the court's order of dismissal. The plaintiff, Minji Jo, filed a complaint against several defendants, alleging causes of action for breach of oral contract, intentional misrepresentation, and conversion. However, the plaintiff's counsel failed to file a default judgment packet and failed to appear at a hearing, resulting in the plaintiff's complaint being dismissed without prejudice. The plaintiff has now moved to vacate the court's order of dismissal, citing the counsel's mistake and inadvertence. The judge has found that the motion is timely and that the plaintiff's counsel has accepted full responsibility for the mistake. Therefore, the court is granting the plaintiff's motion to vacate the order of dismissal and allowing the plaintiff to file a proposed default judgment packet.
