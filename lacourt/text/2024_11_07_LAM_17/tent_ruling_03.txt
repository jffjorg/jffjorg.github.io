BENNY BEHNAM KOHANTEB
  
         vs.
 
ALL CENTURY, INC., et al.

 


 Case No.:  BC409459
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  November 7, 2024




 
            Plaintiff’s Motion
for an Order to Show Cause re: Contempt is GRANTED. Joseph Boodaie and Malka
Sadeghan are ordered to pay Plaintiff’s Attorneys’ Fees and Costs in the amount
of $53,670.01 for their willful disobedience of the Court’s August 13, 2024 order.
 
            On March 11, 2009, Plaintiff Benny Behnam Kohanteb filed
suit against Defendants All Century, Inc., Joseph Boodaie, Comerica Bank, and
Does 1 through 20, inclusive, alleging the following causes of action: (1)
foreclosure of deed of trust; (2) appointment of receiver; (3) specific
performance of deed of trust; (4) injunctive relief; (5) breach of written
guarantee; (6) fraud; (7) conversion; and (8) breach of fiduciary duty.
 
On
February 18, 2010, this Court entered judgment in favor of Plaintiff and
against Defendant Joseph Boodaie (“Defendant” or “Boodaie”) as to the fifth,
sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action, pursuant to a stipulated judgment,
in the amount of $964,709.14.
 
            On February 3, 2020, Plaintiff filed an Application for
and Renewal of Judgment with the Court in the amount of $1,923,912.90,
including the original judgment of $964,709.14, $15.00 in post-judgment costs,
$959,158.76 in post-judgment interest, and $45.00 in fees for filing the
renewal application. The Clerk filed a Notice of Renewal of Judgment on
Defendant on February 4, 2020.
 
            On February 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed an Application and
Order for Appearance and Examination (“ORAP”) as to Boodaie. This Court signed
the ORAP as to Boodaie on February 14, 2024.
 
            On February 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed an affidavit in
support of an ORAP as to third-party Malka Sadeghan in her role as CEO for A.J.
Accounting Services, Inc. On March 19, 2024, this Court signed the ORAP as to
Sadeghan.
 
On
April 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed proof of personal service of the ORAPs on
Boodaie and Sadeghan, as well as Requests for Production of Documents (“RPDs”)
connected to the appearance orders. Both proofs of service indicate that a
registered California process server personally served Boodaie and Sadeghan on
Thursday, March 28, 2024. 
 
On
April 9, 2024, at the original hearing on the ORAPs as to Boodaie and Sadeghan,
Defendant failed to produce documents responsive to Plaintiff’s RPDs. Sadeghan
failed to appear. Boodaie did appear and requested that the Court continue the
ORAP to June 28, 2024, so that Defendant could obtain the responsive documents.
The Court continued the hearing on the ORAPs to June 28, 2024, and issued a
bench warrant for Sadeghan’s appearance at the June 28 hearing with bond set at
$10,000.
 
On
June 28, 2024, both Boodaie and Sadeghan appeared and the Court recalled and
quashed the bench warrant as to Sadeghan. Both Boodaie and Sadeghan failed to
produce documents responsive to Plaintiff’s RPDs. The Court continued the
hearing on the ORAPs until July 3, 2024 to allow Boodaie and Sadeghan to
produce the responsive documents.
 
On
July 3, 2024, Sadeghan again failed to appear. Boodaie did appear, but again
failed to produce responsive documents. The Court continued the hearing on the
ORAPs until July 18, 2024, and re-issued the bench warrant for Sadeghan’s
appearance.
 
On
July 18, 2024, and August 13, 2024, this Court twice more continued the hearing
on Plaintiff’s ORAPs. Boodaie and Sadeghan appeared at both hearings, but again
failed to produce responsive documents. At the hearing on August 13, 2024, the
Court issued an order, requiring the following: (1) Plaintiff to serve a
supplemental RPD demand on Boodaie and Sadeghan by August 30, 2024; (2) Boodaie
and Sadeghan to serve verified responses to the supplemental RPD by September
16, 2024; and (3) Defendant and Sadeghan to seek leave of Court for any
protective orders for documents not produced by September 30, 2024. Further,
Court ordered the parties to meet and confer prior to the next hearing on
Plaitniff’s ORAPs.
 
On
August 30, 2024, Plaintiff served supplemental RPD demands on Boodaie and
Sadeghan. (Mobasser Decl., ¶ 10, Exh. 6.) However, Boodaie and Sadeghan failed
to serve any responsive documents to the supplemental RPD. (Id.) Further,
on September 17, 2024, Plaintiff sent a meet and confer correspondence
requesting Boodaie and Sadeghan to serve their responsive documents in
compliance with this Court’s order. (Id., ¶ 11, Exh. 7.) However,
Boodaie and Sadeghan again failed to serve any responsive documents.
 
            Now, on October 9, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant
motion for an Order to Show Cause re: Contempt against Defendant Joseph Boodaie
and third-party Malka Sadeghan based on their failure to comply with the
Court’s August 13, 2024, order, and for attorneys’ fees and costs in the amount
of $55,470.01 against Boodaie and Sadeghan jointly and severally.
 
            As of October 31, 2024, this motion is unopposed. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Courts
have inherent power to punish acts that interfere with the orderly conduct of
proceedings. (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(3).) Particular acts
constituting contempt are enumerated by statute, including “[d]isobedience of
any lawful judgment, order, or process of the court.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1209(a)(5).)¿¿ 
 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1211, when contempt is committed outside the
presence of the court (“indirect contempt”), an affidavit or declaration shall
be presented to the court of the facts constituting the contempt. The elements
of contempt via disobedience of a court order are (1) the rendition of a valid
order, (2) the respondent’s knowledge of the order, (3)¿the respondent’s
ability to comply with the order; and (4) the respondent’s willful disobedience
of the order. (Conn v. Superior Court (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 774, 784.)
 
Code
of Civil Procedure sections 1210-1222 concern contempt proceedings.
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 1218, subdivision (a) states: “Upon the answer and
evidence taken, the court or judge shall determine whether the person proceeded
against is guilty of the contempt charged, and if it be adjudged that the
person is guilty of the contempt, a fine may be imposed on the person not
exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), payable to the court, or the person
may be imprisoned not exceeding five days, or both. In addition, a person who
is subject to a court order as a party to the action, or any agent of this
person, who is adjudged guilty of contempt for violating that court order may
be ordered to pay to the party initiating the contempt proceeding the
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred by this party in connection with
the contempt proceeding.”  
 
Lastly,
Los Angeles Superior Court rule 3.11 states the following.  
 
“Indirect
contempts [i.e., those that are not committed in the immediate view and
presence of the judge] may be heard in the department to which the case is
assigned ….” (Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 3.11.) 
 
“Although
Code of Civil Procedure section 1212 permits a warrant of attachment against
the person charged with contempt, the standard procedure is section 1212’s
alternative method of issuance of an order to show cause (‘OSC’) re: contempt.
An OSC will issue if the affidavit is sufficient, and the OSC must then be
personally served on the accused person. …. If the accused person is served
with the OSC and fails to appear, the court may issue a body attachment.”
(Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 3.11(a).)  
 
“The
hearing on the OSC re: contempt is in the nature of a quasi-criminal trial. The
accused person has the right to appointed counsel, to remain silent, to
confront and cross-examine witnesses, and to be proven guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt. The only major difference between contempt and a criminal
trial is that the accused person has no right to a jury. The moving party must
appear for the trial with witnesses prepared to testify unless the accused
person stipulates in writing that the moving party’s declarations will
constitute the case-in-chief against him or her. If there is no stipulation,
the parties should stipulate that the moving parties’ declarations will
constitute the direct testimony of each declarant, with the declarant then
subject to cross-examination.” (Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 3.11
(b).) 
 
“If
the court finds the accused person guilty, the court may impose a fine of up to
$1,000, imprison the person for up to five days, or both, for each act of
contempt. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1218.) When the contempt consists of the omission
to perform an act which is yet in the power of the person to perform, the court
may order that the person be imprisoned until the act is performed. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1219.)” (Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 3.11(c).)
 
Discussion 
 
            In its motion, Plaintiff argues that this Court should
Boodaie and Sadeghan in contempt because (1) on August 13, 2024, this Court
ordered Boodaie and Sadeghan to produce responsive documents to Plaintiff’s
supplemental RPD; (2) Boodaie and Sadeghan were at the August 13, 2024 hearing,
and were later informed of their non-compliance by Plaintiff’s counsel’s
correspondence on September 17, 2024; (3) Boodaie and Sadeghan were capable of
responding to the Plaintiff’s RPDs through counsel, but ignored Plaintiff’s
correspondence that they had not complied on September 17, 2024; and (4)
Boodaie’s and Sadeghan’s failure to comply with the August 13, 2024 Court Order
was willful because of the repeated continuances granted by this Court, and
their failure to produce any responsive documents despite the Court’s explicit
instructions to do so.
 
            Plaintiff supports its motion with a verified declaration
from its Counsel, Homan Mobasser, which sets forth the facts as established
above in the background section. 
 
Here,
the Court finds that Plaintiff’s Counsel’s affidavit sufficiently establishes
Boodaie’s and Sadeghan’s ability to comply with the Court’s August 13, 2024,
order, and their willful disobedience of the Court’s order.
 
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure, section 1218, subdivision (a), Plaintiff requests
the Court to order Boodaie and Sadeghan to pay Plaintiff’s Attorneys’ fees and
costs in the amount of $55,470.01. 
 
These
costs include $33,300.00 in attorneys’ fees, billed at $600.00 per hour, for
the following: (1) seven (7) hours of attorney work for the April 9, 2024, ORAP
hearing; (2) nine (9) hours of attorney work for the June 28, 2024, ORAP
hearing; (3) three and a half (3.5) hours of attorney work for the July 3, 2024
ORAP hearing; (4) nine (9) hours of attorney work for the July 11, 2024 ORAP
hearing; (5) nine (9) hours of attorney work for the July 18, 2024 ORAP
hearing; (6) ten (10) hours of attorney work for the August 13, 2024 ORAP
hearing; (7) four (4) hours for preparing the instant Motion for Order to Show
Cause re: Contempt; and (8) an anticipated four (4) hours to review any
opposition, prepare a reply, and to appear at the hearing on this motion. (Mobasser
Decl., ¶ 13.)
 
The requested
costs also include $22,170.01 in costs for the following: (1) $3,026.36 for the
Court Reporter at the April 9, 2024 ORAP hearing; (2) $4,204.52 for the Court
Reporter at the June 28, 2024 ORAP hearing; (3) $2,626.36 for the Court
Reporter at the July 3, 2024 ORAP hearing; (4) $3,258.61 for the the Court
Reporter at the July 11, 2024 ORAP hearing; (5) $3,443.72 for the             Court Reporter at the July 18, 2024
ORAP hearing; (6) $5,550.44 for the Court Reporter at the August 13, 2024 ORAP
hearing; and (7) a $60.00 filing fee for the instant motion, erroneously
referred to as the prior Ex Parte Application. (Mobasser Decl., ¶ 14.)
 
The
Court finds that Plaintiff’s Counsel’s hourly rate is reasonable, and that the
requested costs for hiring the Court Reporter for the ORAP hearings and the
filing fee for this motion is also reasonable. However, given that no
opposition or reply were filed, the Court uses its discretion to strike the
attorney’s fees requested by three (3) hours. Accordingly, the Court grants
Plaintiff’s request to order Boodaie and Sadeghan to pay Plaintiff’s Attorneys’
Fees and Costs in the total amount of $53,670.01.
 
It is so ordered.
