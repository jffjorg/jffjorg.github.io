**Tentative Ruling**

The Court has reviewed the motion to strike by Cross-Defendants Hector P Estrada and Adriana Estrada, seeking to strike Orion Transit, Inc.'s request for attorney's fees in the Cross-Complaint. The Court finds that Cross-Defendants' motion to strike is granted in part, as Orion fails to allege a statutory or contractual basis to request attorney fees in this action.

The Court strikes references to "attorneys' fees" included in Paragraph 9, 14, 20, 21, and 5 of the Cross-Complaint. However, the Court finds that prevailing party costs are recoverable.

This tentative ruling is based on the Court's analysis of California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) sections 435 and 436, as well as the case law cited, including Real Property Services Corp. v. City of Pasadena (1994). The Court will issue a final ruling after considering any further submissions by the parties.
