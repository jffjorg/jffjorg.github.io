 Case Number:  22STCV05716    Hearing Date:   October 2, 2024    Dept:  T Motion To Compel Plaintiff’s ResponsesMoving Party: Defendant Uber Technologies, Inc.Responding Party: Plaintiff Alison Zatta Tentative Ruling: Granted in partBACKGROUNDThis is a negligence case arising from a car accident. On February 15, 2022, Plaintiff Alison Zatta (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendant alleging motor vehicle and general negligence arising from a February 18, 2020 car accident, contending Defendant is liable for her alleged damages. (Declaration of Pragya Sharma (“PS Dec.”), ¶ 2.) Defendant contests Plaintiff’s allegations, and served Plaintiff with Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two, Requests For Admission, and Special Interrogatories (collectively “Discovery Requests”) on May 14, 2024, seeking information on Plaintiff’s injuries, medical expenses, and claim for loss of income or earning capacity. (PS Dec., ¶ ¶ 3, 4, Exhibits 1 to 3.) Plaintiff’s responses to Discovery Requests were due on June 15, 2024. (PS Dec., ¶ 5.) Plaintiff failed to serve responses to Defendant’s Discovery Requests; accordingly on July 18, 2024, Defendant’s counsel emailed Plaintiff’s counsel requesting an update on the status of Plaintiff’s responses to Discovery Requests. (PS Dec., ¶ 6.) Plaintiff’s counsel did not respond. (PS Dec., ¶ 7.)MOVING PARTY POSITIONDefendant argues Plaintiff should be compelled to respond to Discovery Requests, as Plaintiff has yet to serve responses despite Defendant’s attempt to meet and confer.Defendant further requests monetary sanctions be imposed on Plaintiff and/or his counsel in the amount of $560.00 total: $360.00 for the preparation and filing of this motion, and $200.00 in anticipated future related costs for the preparation of a reply brief and appearance at the hearing. (PS Dec., ¶ 13.) OPPOSITION“[A] trial court has broad discretion to accept or reject late-filed papers. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300(d).)”  (Rancho Mirage Country Club Homeowners Assn. v. Hazelbaker (2016) 2 Cal.App.5th 252, 262.)  A trial court does not abuse its discretion by refusing to consider late-filed papers when a party makes no attempt to seek leave to file papers late and does not attempt to show good cause for the late filing. (Ibid.; see also Samaniego v. Empire Today, LLC (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 1138, 1146 [party “provided no plausible explanation for its tardiness and the court acted within its discretion when it denied leave to file them”].)Plaintiff filed an untimely opposition on September 30, 2024, but offered no explanation as to why the opposition was not filed earlier.  The Court exercises its discretion to consider the opposition only to the extent that it establishes that verified responses were served prior to the time of the hearing on Defendant’ motions. ANALYSISI. Motions to Compel A plaintiff may make a demand for production of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for production of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply with the formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party may propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).)The party whom the request is propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a) - (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).) If a party fails to timely respond to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) There is no requirement to meet and confer before filing a motion to compel responses. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 906 [“Where no objections have been made within the statutorily permitted time, they are deemed waived. There is thus nothing to ‘resolve’ . . . .”].Here, Plaintiff has responded to all written discovery with the exception of Request for Production #15.  As such the Court grants Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Request for Production #15.  II. SanctionsThe party who propounded the discovery request may bring a motion to compel and the court shall impose a monetary sanction against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for production of documents or interrogatories, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)Here, Defendant requests $560.00 in sanctions against Plaintiff, including $360.00 for costs incurred to prepare Defendant’s motion and $200.00 in anticipated future costs pertaining to this motion. The Court finds the requested sanctions to be reasonable.   RULINGThe Motion to Compel is granted as to Request for Production #15.  The request for monetary sanctions against Plaintiff is GRANTED in the amount of $560.00.
