Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the University of Southern California's ("USC") motion to deem all matters contained in its Requests for Admission, Set One, as admitted. This is due to the Plaintiff's failure to respond to the requests, despite being served on June 21, 2024, and failing to provide responses despite a correspondence from defense counsel on July 26, 2024. The Court also awards USC $735.00 in sanctions, consisting of $675.00 in attorney fees for three hours of work and a $60.00 filing fee.
