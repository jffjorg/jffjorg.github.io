  Case Number:  21STCV24281    Hearing Date:   October 2, 2024    Dept:  T Motion For An Order Deeming All Matters Contained In Defendant’s Requests For Admission, Set One, AdmittedMoving Party: Defendant University of Southern California (“USC”)Responding Party: N/ATentative Ruling: GRANTBACKGROUNDPlaintiff, Julianne Lattner (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint on June 30, 2021 stating a cause of action of negligence. Plaintiff amended her complaint on May 1, 2024, naming Defendant as Doe 1. Defendant filed an Answer to Plaintiff’s Complaint on June 21, 2024, and the same day served Requests for Admission (Set One) onto Plaintiff. Responses to Defendant’s Requests were due by July 23, 2024; Plaintiff failed to serve responses. (Stockalper Decl. ¶ 3). On July 26, 2024, defense counsel sent a correspondence to Plaintiff’s counsel and requested that Plaintiff’s responses, without objections, be provided within 10 days of the date of the letter. (Stockalper Decl. ¶ 4). Defendant has still not received Plaintiff’s responses to Defendant’s Requests for Admission (Set One).MOVING PARTY POSITIONDefendant argues that all matters specified in its Requests for Admission be deemed admitted, due to Plaintiff’s failure to provide responses to Defendant’s timely provided Requests for Admission. Defendant argues Plaintiff’s delay has continuing prejudice on Defendant by preventing Defendant from identifying additional witnesses and forcing Defendant to conduct the remaining discovery necessary to prepare for trial. (Motion to Deem Requests for Admission as Admitted p. 5.)Defendant also argues the Court should impose sanctions in the amount of $735.00 based on three hours of work at a $225.00 per hour rate, in addition to a $60.00 filing fee. (Declaration of Patrick E. Stockalper ¶ 7.)OPPOSITIONNo opposition was filed in response to this motion. ANALYSISI.  Motion to Deem Requests for Admission AdmittedWhere there has been no timely response to a request for admission under CCP § 2033.010, the propounding party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. (CCP § 2033.280(b).) CCP § 2033.280(c) states, in relevant part: “The court shall make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.If a party to whom requests for production of documents were directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (CCP § 2031.300(b)-(c).) CCP § 2031.300 contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have been served. The propounding party need not demonstrate good cause or satisfy a meet-and-confer requirement – all that needs to be shown in the moving papers is that a set of requests for production of documents was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403-04.)Here, it is appropriate to grant Defendant’s motion. Defendant served its Request for Admission (Set One) upon Plaintiff on June 21, 2024, who has yet to provide responses or answers to these requests for admission.  Plaintiff’s lack of opposition to Defendant’s motion provides the Court no reason to find substantial justification for the failure to respond. Accordingly, the Court will grant Defendant’s request to deem requests for admission as admitted.II. SanctionsDefendant requests $735.00 in sanctions against Plaintiff based on two hours of work in addition to a $60.00 filing fee. (Declaration of Patrick E. Stockalper ¶ 7.) The Court finds Defendant’s hourly fee is reasonable as well as the number of hours worked. The Court therefore awards $675.00 in attorney fees for three hours of work, in addition to the $60.00 filing fee, totaling $735.00. RULINGDefendant’s motion to Deem Request for Admissions Admitted is GRANTED. Defendant’s request for sanctions against Plaintiff is GRANTED in the amount of $735.00.
