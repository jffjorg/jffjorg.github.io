And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $292,100. The plaintiff seeks these fees based on the defendant's failure to admit certain Requests for Admission (RFA's) during discovery. The defendant asserts that they had reasonable grounds to believe they would prevail on these issues. The Judge agrees that the defendant had reasonable grounds to believe they would prevail on several of the RFA's, including RFA's 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, as the evidence was hotly contested and the defendant's positions were reasonable at the time of the RFA responses. However, the Judge finds that the defendant unreasonably denied RFA 1, which requested that the roadway at issue was the defendant's responsibility. The Judge also finds that the defendant had good reason not to admit RFA 13, which requested that the roadway defect was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff's injury, as the defendant had not yet deposed the plaintiff on these critical issues.
