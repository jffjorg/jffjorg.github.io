INTRODUCTION
 
This was a personal injury trial in which the jury
found that Plaintiff (“P”) was injured due to a defect in Defendant City of Los
Angeles’ roadway.  P now moves for
$292,100 in “cost-of-proof” attorney’s fees based on D having denied several
Requests for Admission (“RFA’s”) in discovery. 

 
                                                                    ANALYSIS
 
A.   
Plaintiff’s
Motion for Attorney’s Fees/Cost of Proof Sanctions
 
Plaintiff seeks “cost of proof” attorney’s fees and
costs per § CCP 2033.420 based on Defendant’s failure to admit certain Requests
for Admission.  Defendant asserts that the
motion should be denied as it “had reasonable ground to believe . . . [he]
would prevail on the matter,” and/or that he had “other good reason for the
failure to admit.”  CCP 2033.420(a)(3)
& (4).   
 
With respect to D’s failure to admit RFA’s 3, 7, 8, 9,
11, this Court finds that D had reasonable grounds to believe it would prevail
on those issues.  The evidence was hotly
contested and argued before the factfinder and this Court finds D’s positions
on these issues, although not ultimately successful, were nevertheless
reasonable at the time of the RFA responses. 
D answered P’s complaint on 7/20/22 and provided responses to RFA’s 1
and 3 on 11/21/22, about 4 months from appearing in this case.  According to D, these responses were
submitted before D began investigating the allegations.  Subsequently, on 2/15/23, D responded to P’s
second set for RFA’s, specifically RFA’s 7, 8, 9, 11, and 13.  RFA’s 1 and 13 are a closer call and analyzed
below.
 
With respect to RFA 1 (City’s roadway), this Court
finds it was unreasonable for D’s to have denied the request that the roadway
at issue was its responsibility. 
However, this Court also finds that D ultimately admitted as much at the
start of trial and therefore P expended no resources to prove this issue as it
was admitted before the start of evidence. 

 
With respect to RFA 13 (upraised roadway was
substantial factor in causing injury), D asserts that those requests were made
before P’s deposition and IME.  This
Court agrees that sufficient time had passed for D to have investigated the
accident.  Had the RFA simply requested D
to admit that P suffered some physical injury from the fall, this Court would likely
award cost-of-proof sanctions.  However,
RFA 13 requests that D admit that the roadway defect was a substantial factor
in causing P’s harm.  The only witness
who had first-hand knowledge of how she fell was P herself as there were apparently
no other eyewitnesses to the fall.  Nothing
within the knowledge of D alone would allow it to opine about or conclude how P
fell and the role the asphalt played in the fall, if any.  In other words, the deposition of P was
critical in supplying D with the knowledge of how the upraised asphalt caused P
to trip.  Moreover, there was also the
issue of whether the raised asphalt was visible to P; indeed, there was
testimony that P had not worn her prescription eyeglasses on this occasion and
may not have seen the hazard because of her own contributory negligence.  Given the wording of RFA13 and the fact that
D had not yet deposed P on these critical issues, this Court finds D had “good
reason not to admit” RFA 13 on 2/15/23.
 
Plaintiff’s motion for cost-of-proof attorney’s fees
is DENIED.
