The court has examined the filing and found that the successor in interest has filed a declaration fulfilling all the requirements under CCP § 377.32. A certified copy of the decedent's death certificate is also attached, but it is illegible. The court will conditionally grant the present motion upon the filing of a legible certificate of death.
