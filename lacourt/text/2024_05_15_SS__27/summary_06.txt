The plaintiff failed to serve discovery responses and did not file an opposition. The court has ordered the plaintiff to provide discovery responses within 20 days without objections. The court has also deemed admitted the contents of the RFAs (Set One). Due to the plaintiff's failure to provide discovery responses, the defendant incurred attorney's fees and has requested sanctions in the amount of $1,323.30 for each motion. The court has reduced the sanction to $2,000 for all four motions. The plaintiff is hereby ordered to pay the defendant the amount of $2,000 at a rate of $500 per month beginning June 1, 2024, until paid in full.
