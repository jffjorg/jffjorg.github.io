And here is a text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to strike the allegations relating to punitive damages in the plaintiff's second amended complaint. The court found that the allegations do not demonstrate the willful and despicable conduct required for punitive damages. The court also denied leave to amend the complaint. The plaintiff's allegations that the defendant failed to take adequate safety measures and instructed the plaintiff to navigate the dangerous trenches to deliver food are legal conclusions and not facts pled with the requisite specificity. The court found that the alleged facts do not rise to the level of "despicable conduct". The court ordered that the parties must submit by email to this tentative ruling and that the parties should arrange to appear remotely or in person for oral argument.
