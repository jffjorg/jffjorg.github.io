Requests for Production and Interrogatories 
 
A plaintiff may make a demand for
production of documents and propound interrogatories without leave of court at
any time 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, the
party to whom the demand is directed, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.020, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.020, subd. (b).) The demand for
production of documents is not limited by number, but the request must comply
with the formatting requirements in Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.030. A party
may propound 35 specially prepared interrogatories that are relevant to the
subject matter of the pending action and any additional number of official form
interrogatories that are relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.030, subd. (a)(1) - (a)(2).)
 
The party whom the request is
propounded upon is required to respond within 30 days after service of a
demand, but the parties are allowed to informally agree to an extension and
confirm any such agreement in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.270, subd. (a)
- (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.270, subd. (a) - (b).)
 
If a party fails to timely respond
to a request for production or interrogatories, the party to whom the request
is directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.230, and waives any objection, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).)¿¿The party propounding the
discovery requests may move for an order compelling responses. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) Unlike a motion to compel further discovery responses, a
motion to compel initial discovery responses does not have any meet and confer
requirements.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (a) provides, in pertinent part, that the court may
impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct. A misuse of the discovery process includes
failing to respond or submit to an authorized method of discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)¿¿¿A court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable
monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare
Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 771, 791.)
 
2.         
Request for Admissions
 
“Any party may obtain discovery .
. . by a written request that any other party to the action admit the
genuineness of specified documents, or the truth of specified matters of fact,
opinion relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for admission
may relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.”¿ CCP § 2033.010.¿ “Within 30 days after service of
requests for admission, the party to whom the requests are directed shall serve
the original of the response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the
response on all other parties who have appeared ....”¿ CCP § 2033.250(a).
 
If a party to whom request for
admissions are served fails to provide a timely response, the party to whom the
request was directed waives any objections, including based on privilege or the
work product doctrine. CCP § 2033.280(a). The requesting party can move for an
order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters
specified in the request be deemed admitted, as well as for monetary sanctions.
CCP § 2033.280(b). The court shall issue this order unless the party to whom
the request was made serves a response in substantial compliance prior to the
hearing on the motion. CCP § 2033.280(c). Unlike a motion to compel further
discovery responses, a motion to deem RFA admitted does not have any meet and
confer requirements.
 
Discussion
On November 13, 2023,
Defendant Uber Technologies served its Requests for Admission (Set One),
Requests for Production (Set One), Form Interrogatories (Set One), and Special
Interrogatories (Set One) on Plaintiff Alfredo Becerra-Aguilar. Defendant gave
Plaintiff numerous extensions with a final extension set for February 1, 2024.
However, Plaintiff failed to serve any objections or responses. On March 19,
2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s request to be relieved as
counsel. On March 22, 2024, Defendant sent Plaintiff a copy of the discovery
requests and requests discovery responses to be provided by March 27, 2024. However,
Defendant received no responses from Plaintiff. Defendant now moves the Court
to compel Plaintiff to provide discovery responses and deem the contents of its
RFAs (Set One) admitted.
Plaintiff failed to
serve discovery responses before the statutory deadline. Plaintiff did not file
an opposition or any other documents showing that responses had been made prior
to the hearing. Thus, Defendant’s motions are GRANTED. Plaintiff is ordered to
provide discovery responses to Uber’s Requests for Production (Set One), Form
Interrogatories (Set One), and Special Interrogatories (Set One) within 20 days
of today without objections. Further, Uber’s Requests for Admissions (Set One) are
deemed admitted.
Because of Plaintiff’s
failure to provide discovery responses, Defendant was forced to file the
present motion and incur attorney’s fees. Defendant requests sanctions in the
amount of $1,323.30 for each motion. Due to the simplicity of the motions and
the lack of an opposition, the Court exercises its discretion and reduces the
sanction to $2,000 for all four motions. Plaintiff is hereby ordered to pay
Defendant the amount of $2,000 at a rate of $500 per month beginning June 1,
2024, until paid in full.
