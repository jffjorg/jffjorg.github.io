And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the defendant's motion to continue the trial date from November 13, 2024, to January 6, 2025, to allow the defendant to present its motion for summary judgment (MSJ) scheduled for November 20, 2024. The court has considered the factors for granting a continuance, including the proximity of the trial date, whether there was any previous continuance of trial due to any party, and the length of the continuance requested. The court has also taken into account that the defendant's sole basis for continuing the trial is to present its MSJ, and has determined that continuing the trial date is good cause.
