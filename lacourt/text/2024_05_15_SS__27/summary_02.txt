Here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment in a premises liability and negligence lawsuit. The plaintiff, Floyd Wiltz, slipped and fell on the stairs of the defendant, Normandie Portfolio II LP; Inc. The defendant moved for summary judgment, arguing that there was no evidence that the slippery condition was caused by their employee, Obioma Iwuoma.

The court granted the defendant's motion, finding that the plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence to create a triable issue of fact. The court noted that the plaintiff's testimony and the declarations of the plaintiff and Dashida Gordan were speculative and insufficient to overcome the defendant's evidence that Iwuoma did not create the slippery condition.

The court also noted that the plaintiff's burden was to show that a triable issue of fact existed, and the defendant had met its initial burden in showing that the water that allegedly caused the plaintiff's fall was not created by Iwuoma.
