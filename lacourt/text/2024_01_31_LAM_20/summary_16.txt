And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in an unlawful detainer action involving Tashagay Spencer, who has demurred to the Complaint alleging that the 3-Day Notice to Pay/Quit is defective because it does not contain the provision mandated by Code Civ. Proc. § 1161(2). The judge has ruled that the demurrer is without merit, as the notice attached to the Complaint includes the amount due and the name, telephone number, and address of the person to whom the rent payment should be made. The judge has also noted that Civ. Code § 1946 is not applicable to this matter, as it pertains to renewing or terminating leases without a stated duration. The judge has overruled the demurrer and ordered the filing of an answer within 5 days. The judge has also encouraged counsel to submit their views on the tentative ruling through LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
