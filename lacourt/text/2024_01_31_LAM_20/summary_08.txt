And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Demurrer filed by the defendants, Rafael Manso Rocha and Paulina Espinoza Casillas, to the unlawful detainer action. The defendants argue that the complaint is based on a fraudulent document and that the plaintiff did not accept the rent before the notice expired. However, the judge finds that the Demurrer is improper because it challenges the truth of the pleadings. The judge also finds that the defendants' arguments that the notice to quit was never posted and that the complaint violates the Los Angeles County COVID-19 Tenant Protection Resolution lack merit. The judge overrules the Demurrer and orders the defendants to file an answer within five days.
