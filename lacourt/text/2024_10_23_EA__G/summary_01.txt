Here is a summary in English text of the tentative ruling:

The court has denied both of Weishi Xie's motions. The first motion was to amend the previous judgment with a more detailed explanation of the legal grounds and reasoning behind the judgment. However, the court determined that it lacks jurisdiction to consider this motion because Xie filed a notice of appeal from the judgment prior to seeking an amendment. The second motion was to enforce protections on Social Security income and household funds and to unfreeze bank accounts. The court denied this motion because Xie failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish that the funds levied included Social Security funds, and Xie also failed to provide a proper financial statement as required by law.
