BACKGROUND
This is a consolidated action
to quiet title. Plaintiffs Tony To Chong Loo, Cui Ping Loo, Danny Weising Loo,
and William Loo allege that Defendant Zixi Li acted in concert with others to
use the Loos’ names to forge, present, and notarize false powers of attorney
and deeds of trust to obtain loans.
On October 2, 2019, the Loos,
with the exception of William Loo, filed a complaint alleging the following
causes of action against Li, LC Equity Group (LC Equity), Ress Financial
Corporation (Ress Financial), First American Title Company (First American),
Weishi Xie, Agnes N. Nwapa-Jourdan, all persons known and unknown, and Does
1-25: (1) declaratory relief, (2) cancellation of instruments, (3) slander of
title, (4) quiet title, and (5) unjust enrichment. Subsequently, the following
Defendants were added to the action: Sunwest Trust FBO David W. Free (Free
Trust); Steven Goldenberg; Michael J. Tannenbaum; Oxnard Street, LLC (Oxnard
Street); ZVI Gutentag and Michael Gutentag, Trustees of the Gutentag Family
Trust (Gutentag Trust); Sunwest Trust FBO Joseph Davis (Davis Trust); Eyal
Gutentag and Diane Gutentag, Trustees of the Gutentag Revocable Trust, Dated
June 4, 2019 (2019 Gutentag Trust); The Bernard Rothschild Pension Plan, by and
through Bernard Rothschild and James Bernard Rothshild as Trustees (Rothschild
Pension Plan); Summit Capital LLC (Summit), and CDG Investments, LLC (CDG).
On December 5, 2019,
Tannenbaum filed a cross-complaint against Li, Xie, and Roes 1-20, alleging
causes of action for (1) indemnity, (2) contribution, (3) intentional
misrepresentation, (4) concealment, and (5) negligence of a notary public. On
the same day, the Davis Trust, Goldenberg, the 2019 Gutentag Trust, the Free
Trust, the Gutentag Trust, Oxnard Street, CDG, and LC Equity filed a
cross-complaint against the same defendants and alleging the same causes of
action.
On October 2, 2019, William
Loo filed a verified complaint alleging the following causes of action against
Li, M. Zha, Nwapa-Jourdan, Summit, the Rothschild Pension Plan, JMR Investments
(JMR), Does 1-25, and all persons unknown, alleging the following causes of
action: (1) declaratory relief, (2) cancellation of instruments, (3) slander of
title, (4) quiet title, and (5) unjust enrichment.
On December 5, 2019, Summit
and the Rothschild Pension Plan filed a cross-complaint against Li, Zha, and
Roes 1-20 for (1) indemnity, (2) contribution, (3) fraud by intentional
misrepresentation, (4) fraud by concealment, and (5) negligence of a notary public.
On June 7, 2023, the separate
actions by the Loos and William Loo were consolidated into the present action.
On May 23, 2024, the court
entered a judgment in favor of the Loos against Xie, Zha, Li, and Nwapa-Jourdan.

filed a notice of appeal.

filed the present motions.
On October 8, 2024,
Nwapa-Jourdan filed a motion to quash the service of summons.
A hearing on Xie’s present
motions is set for October 23, 2024, with a hearing on Nwapa-Jourdan’s motion
set for November 7, 2024.
ANALYSIS
Xie
moves the court to amend its previous judgment with a more detailed explanation
of the legal grounds and reasoning behind the judgment. Xie also moves the
court for an order enforcing protection against judgment collection efforts and
unfreezing bank accounts. For the following reasons, the court DENIES Xie’s motions.
As
a general rule, “a trial court has no jurisdiction to vacate, modify or
otherwise change an order that is the subject of a pending appeal.” (Royals
v. Lu (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 328, 342; see Laidlaw Waste Systems, Inc. v.
Bay Cities Services, Inc. (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 630, 641.) But an appeal
does not stay the enforcement of a judgment for money or payment of money
unless an undertaking is provided. (Code Civ. Proc., § 917.1, subd. (a)(1).) Here,
because Xie filed a notice of appeal from the court’s judgment prior to seeking
an amendment of that judgment, the court is without jurisdiction to consider
Xie’s first motion. Accordingly, the court DENIES Xie’s motion to amend judgment.
As
to the second motion, the court notes Xie’s appeal has not stayed enforcement
proceedings as the judgment at issue is a money judgment in the amount of $200,000.00
plus $297,048.25 in attorney fees and $126,518.62 in costs. Thus, the court
considers the merits of Xie’s motion.
At
a hearing on a claim of exemption, “the [judgment debtor] has the burden of
proof” in demonstrating that the property claimed exempt is indeed exempt.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 703.520, subd. (b), 703.580, subds. (b), (c).) In meeting
this burden, the judgment debtor must establish the right by evidence or facts;
an affidavit which merely follows the language of the statute and states
nothing more than conclusions of law is insufficient. (Le Font v. Rankin (1959)
167 Cal.App.2d 433, 435.)
In
this case, Xie argues Xie’s Social Security benefits are exempt from wage
garnishment pursuant to 42 U.S.C. section 407. But while Xie is correct, Xie
fails to present any evidence that establishes the funds levied included Social
Security funds. Although Xie has filed a motion and submitted some exhibits,
Xie fails to provide a proper declaration and fails to authenticate the
exhibits provided. While Xie also claims the garnishments will cause financial
hardship, Xie fails to provide a proper financial statement as required by Code
of Civil Procedure section 708.530.
Accordingly,
the court DENIES Xie’s motion.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Xie’s
motion to amend judgment is DENIED. Furthermore, Xie’s motion to enforce
protections and unfreeze bank accounts is DENIED.
