The court has reviewed the motion for appointment of a referee and finds it unnecessary at this time. However, the court has noted that Mr. Mohajerian's interruptions, arguments with counsel, and attempts to rephrase questions during the deposition were unacceptable. The court has directed Mr. Caputo to accept objections and move on with the questioning. The court also advises that meet and confer should be reserved for after the deposition is completed.
