 Case Number:  23VECP00469    Hearing Date:   May 15, 2024    Dept:  T 23VECP00469 Forward Financing v Ahern
[TENTATIVE] ORDER: 
Petitioner Forward Financing, LLC’s Petition to Confirm the Arbitration
Award is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
Introduction 
Petitioner Forward Financing LLC (Petitioner) requests to
have an arbitration award confirmed against Respondents Ahern Construction
Corporation dba Ahern Construction (ACC) and Timtohy J. Ahern (Ahern)
(collectively, Respondents).  The
arbitrator awarded $116,229.48 against Respondents, jointly and severally.  
Procedure
The Court file does not reflect that ACC was served with the
Petition to Confirm the Arbitration Award (Petition).  Without service of the Petition upon ACC, the
Court lacks any jurisdiction over ACC. 
Without jurisdiction over ACC, any ruling upon the Petition would be
void.
It is noted that a proof of service of the Petition was
filed on January 3, 2024 showing substitute-service upon Ahern, as an
individual.  Service upon Ahern, as an
individual, is insufficient to show service upon ACC and/or is insufficient to
impart jurisdiction over ACC.  
Without jurisdiction over ACC, the Court cannot enter an
order confirming the arbitration award, as of yet.
The petition to confirm the arbitration award is DENIED
WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
