And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the petition to confirm the arbitration award without prejudice. The petition was filed by Forward Financing, LLC, which seeks to confirm an arbitration award of $116,229.48 against Ahern Construction Corporation and Timohty J. Ahern. However, the petition was not served on Ahern Construction Corporation, and the court lacks jurisdiction over the company. The court also notes that service on Ahern, as an individual, is insufficient to establish service on the company. As a result, the court cannot enter an order confirming the arbitration award at this time.
