```

And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The court has decided to hear oral argument on the demurrer, specifically regarding whether the allegations of sexual assault and cover-up revive claims against the entity or individuals. The court notes that CCP section 340.16(e) allows for the revival of claims, but the statute is unclear on whether this revival applies only to entities or also to individuals. The court wants to hear argument on this issue, citing no authority on the matter. Additionally, the court reminds all parties that December 31st is not a court holiday, and courts will be open on that day.
