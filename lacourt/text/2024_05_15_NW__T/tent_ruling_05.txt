 Case Number:  24VECV00013    Hearing Date:   May 15, 2024    Dept:  T Doe v Doe
24VECV00013
 
Tentative
ruling on demurrer: Hear oral argument. CCP section 340.16(e) allows for
revival of claims by a plaintiff who alleges all of the following:

The plaintiff was sexually assaulted.
One or more entities are legally responsible
     for the damages arising out of the sexual assault.
The entity or entities, including, but not
     limited to, their officers, directors, representatives, employees, or
     agents, engaged in a cover up or attempted a cover up of a previous
     instance or allegations of sexual assault by an alleged perpetrator of
     such abuse.

The court
would like to hear argument as to whether these allegations revive a claim
against the entity only or also against individuals.  No authority was cited by either side on this
issue.  However, the statute does seem to
refer to revival of claims only against entities: CCP section 340.16(e)(3): “Failure
to allege a cover up as required by subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) as to one
entity does not affect revival of the plaintiff's claim or claims against
any other entity.” On the other hand, section (e)(1) starts out by saying that
...”any claim...is hereby revived...” not exclusively claims against an entity.
 
Finally,
the court notes that Dec. 31st is NOT a court holiday.  Barring it being a weekend, courts are open
on Dec.31st.
