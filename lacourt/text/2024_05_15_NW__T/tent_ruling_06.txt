 Case Number:  24VECV00579    Hearing Date:   May 15, 2024    Dept:  T 24VECV00579
Frandsen v Foxman
Tentative ruling: Ex parte application to advance trial date.  Granted. 
In light of the court’s orders in 23STCV19020 Foxman v Frandsen
expunging the Foxmans’ lis pendens on the subject property and the court’s
order sustaining the demurrer with direction that the Foxmans’ further amended
complaint may not contain any cause of action based on the one-action rule, the
court grants the ex parte application to advance the trial date from 6/17/2024
to 5/23/2024 at 9:30 a.m.  Final Status
Conference is set 5/21/2024 at 8:30 a.m. 
By that date, jury instructions shall be printed and lodged, witness and
exhibit lists from both sides, statement of the case from both sides, proposed
verdict form, and exhibit books (3 for the court) shall be filed/lodged.  As the court ordered $16,000 to be filed by
the Foxmans on deposit to continue the trial, and the trial is only being
continued for 6 weeks instead of 9 weeks, the court orders a refund to
defendant in the sum of $5,333 from the funds on deposit.  If the required trial documents have not been filed
in full by at least one party, the trial will trail day to day until ready to
start.
