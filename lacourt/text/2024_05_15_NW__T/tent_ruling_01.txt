  Case Number:  22VECV01240    Hearing Date:   May 15, 2024    Dept:  T 22VECV01240 Soto v Puretek
Tentative ruling:  The court has reviewed the motion for appointment of a referee and finds that it is, at this time, not necessary.  However, there were many interruptions by Mr. Mohajerian in which he argues with counsel or attempts to rephrase the questions.  Counsel at depositions are restricted to stating their objection and if needed, direct the witness not to answer.  There should be no other talking or interrupting by the attorneys. The court notes that Mr. Caputo engaged Mr. Mohajerian unnecessarily resulting in arguments between the two. Examples of unacceptable interruptions by Mr. Mohajerian which include prompting the witness are as follows: Page 36 lines 7-9; page 38 lines 8-14; page 45 lines 19-21; page 46 lines 5-25 thru page 3-20; page 48 lines 8-25 thru page 49 lines 1-2; page 49 lines 16-25 thru page 50 line 1; page 50 lines 15-18; page 52 lines 14-24.  Mr. Caputo is directed to accept the objections and move on in questioning.  In the future, reserve your meet and confer for after the deposition is completed.  After the deposition, if there were instructions not to answer or some other basis to compel an answer, the court can review that in a motion to compel.
