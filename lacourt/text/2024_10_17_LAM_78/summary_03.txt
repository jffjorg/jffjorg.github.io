And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in a lawsuit between DEL SOL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT, Inc. (plaintiff) and HOA MANAGEMENT PROFESSIONALS, INC. (defendant). The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant for failing to obey subpoenas, and the defendant filed a demurrer and motion to strike. The judge has overruled the defendant's demurrer and granted the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages and forfeiture of $1,500.00.

The judge has also ruled that the plaintiff's claims are sufficient to state a cause of action against the defendant, and that the defendant's failure to obey subpoenas does not constitute a valid defense. The judge has also held that the plaintiff has failed to show malice or intentional wrongdoing on the part of the defendant, and therefore, punitive damages are not recoverable.

The judge has ordered the parties to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement, and if not, to appear remotely or in person for oral argument. The judge has also prohibited the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.
