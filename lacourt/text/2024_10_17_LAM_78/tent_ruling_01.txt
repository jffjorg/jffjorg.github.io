  Case Number:  24STCP00216    Hearing Date:   October 17, 2024    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78 ¿ FANTAWILD ANIMATION, INC., Petitioner, vs. NOWA FILMLATKA DISTRIBUTION SP ZOO, et al., Respondent. Case No.: 24STCP00216 Hearing Date: October 17, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING PETITION TO CONFIRM ARBITRATION AWARD  I. BACKGROUND On December 15, 2023, Arbitrator Lorin Brennan, through the International Centre For Dispute Resolution, issued an arbitration award in favor of Petitioner Fantawild Animation, Inc. (“Petitioner”) and against Respondent Nowa Filmlatka Distribution SP. Z.O.O. (“Respondent”) in the amount of $87,000 and for Respondent to deliver to Petitioner all materials for three animated motion pictures (Boonie Bears: Back to Earth, Boonie Bears: Blast Into The Past, and Boonie Bears: The Wild Life) previously delivered to Respondent.  (Pet. ¶¶ 8, 10; Attachment 10(g).) On January 22, 2024, Petitioner filed the instant Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award (“Petition”) against Respondent. On August 16, 2024, the Court identified two procedural defects with the Petition: (1) there was no proof of service the petition and notice was served in the same manner as a summons in an action pursuant to CCP § 1290.4, and (2) there was no proof of service confirming the arbitration award was served on the parties by the arbitrator pursuant to CCP §1283.6. The motion was therefore continued to October 17, 2024 to provide Petitioner the opportunity to cure the noted defects. On September 23, 2024, Petitioner filed a copy of the Notice of the Final Award served on Respondent by email and by Federal Express on December 14, 2023 by the American Arbitration Association. Petitioner simultaneously filed a Proof of Electronic Service to Respondent’s agent Jurek Jednorowski (“Mr. Jednorowski”).  II. CONFIRM ARBITRATION AWARD Legal Standard Once arbitration is concluded, “any arbitrator’s award is enforceable only when confirmed as a judgment of the superior court.” (O’Hare v. Municipal Resource Consultants (2003) 107¿Cal.App.4th 267, 278.). Any of the parties may file a petition with the court, which must then “confirm the award, correct and confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss the petition.”¿ (Code¿of¿Civil¿Proc.¿§§¿1285, 1286; EHM Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of Hollywood,¿Inc.¿(2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.) “It is well settled that the scope of judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely narrow.”¿(California Faculty Assn. v. Superior Court¿(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 935, 943.)¿ “Neither the trial court, nor the appellate court, may ‘review the merits of the dispute, the sufficiency of the evidence, or the arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we correct or review an award because of an arbitrator’s legal or factual error, even if it appears on the award’s face.” (EHM Productions, supra, at p. 1063-64.) Filing Requirements CCP § 1285.4 states: “A petition under this chapter shall:¿(a) Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement.¿(b) Set forth the names of the arbitrators.¿(c) (c) Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.”¿ Petitioner submits a summary of the provision in Paragraph V.B. of the agreement providing for an arbitration agreement entered on May 9, 2022. (Pet., ¶ 4.) The arbitration was conducted by Arbitrator Ashlei Vargas. (Pet., ¶ 6).) A copy of the arbitration award and written opinion is attached to the petition. (Pet. ¶10(g), Attachment 10(g).) The Court finds that Petitioner has satisfied CCP §1285.4 requirements. Service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing (CCP § 1290.4) CCP § 1290.4 states in pertinent part:¿¿ ¿“(a) A copy of the petition and a written notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof and any other papers upon which the petition is based shall be served in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for the service of such petition and notice.¿ ¿(b) If the arbitration agreement does not provide the manner in which such service shall be made and the person upon whom service is to be made has not previously appeared in the proceeding and has not previously been served in accordance with this subdivision: [¶] (1) Service within this State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action.”¿ ¿ Here, the arbitration agreement provides that the parties agree to accept service of process in accordance with the IFTA Rules for International Arbitration (“IFTA Rules”). (Pet. ¶ 4.) Petitioner avers that Mr. Jednorowski e-mail responses to the ICDR indicate he has been receiving e-mails on behalf of Responded regarding the arbitration and of the proceedings. (Pet. ¶ 8.) Petitioner filed proof of service demonstrating Respondent’s agent for service of process was electronically served with this Petition and notice of hearing on September 21, 2024. (Proof of Service, Sept. 23, 2024.) The Court finds that Petitioner has served notice of hearing in compliance with CCP §1290.4. Service of the Arbitration Award and Timeliness of Petition (CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4) CCP §1283.6 provides that: “The neutral arbitrator shall serve a signed copy of the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by registered or certified mail or as provided in the agreement.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 1283.6.)¿Additionally, a party may seek a court judgment confirming an arbitration award by filing and serving a petition no more than four years, but not less than 10 days, after the award is served.¿(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.) Petitioner indicates the arbitration award was served on December 15, 2023. (Pet., ¶ 9a.)¿Petitioner has attached only the arbitration Final Award. Petitioner provides a copy of the proof of service confirming that the arbitration award was served on the parties by the arbitrator on December 15, 2023.¿ The Court finds the petition timely pursuant to CCP §§ 1288 and 1288.4.  III. CONCLUSION & ORDER For the foregoing reasons, Petitioner Fantawild Animation, Inc.’s Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award is GRANTED.¿¿  Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: October 16, 2024 __________________________ Hon.
