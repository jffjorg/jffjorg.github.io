And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash deposition subpoenas for production of business records filed by the plaintiff, Diana Lujan. The plaintiff is seeking to quash the subpoenas issued by the defendants, L. Scott Frazier, PH.D., et al., which seek records from various companies and individuals related to the plaintiff's medical treatment and employment history.

The judge finds that the subpoenas are overbroad and seek information that is not directly relevant to the litigation. The judge grants the motion in part, modifying the remainder of the subpoenas to limit the scope of the discovery to only the records that are reasonably related to the plaintiff's injuries and damages.

The judge also finds that the defendants have not shown that the requests for the entirety of documents without limitation are directly relevant to the litigation, and therefore, the court declines to grant the motion to quash the subpoenas in their entirety.

The judge orders the parties to meet and confer after reading the tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on the tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
