And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in two separate motions to compel further responses. In the first motion, the plaintiffs seek to compel FCA to serve verified responses to special interrogatories. The judge denies the motion on the merits and instead orders the parties to conduct a meaningful meet and confer in person or telephonically. The judge also orders the parties to file a joint statement of remaining issues.

In the second motion, the plaintiffs seek to compel FCA to serve verified responses to requests for production. The judge denies the motion on the merits and instead orders the parties to conduct a meaningful meet and confer in person or telephonically. The judge also orders the parties to file a joint statement of remaining issues.

The judge notes that the parties have not demonstrated good cause or substantive justification for their discovery requests and that the requests are vague, ambiguous, and go far beyond the scope of permissible discovery. The judge also notes that FCA has agreed to cooperate and resolve discovery disputes and that the parties have ignored the court's live meet and confer requirement.

The judge orders the parties to review the court's Song-Beverly Litigation Discovery Order, the court's Information Bulletin, and the court's Final Status Conference Order. The judge also orders the parties to file a joint statement of remaining issues, which should briefly describe the matters in dispute, followed by the moving party's statement of why it should be compelled, followed by the opposing party's statement of why it should not be compelled.
