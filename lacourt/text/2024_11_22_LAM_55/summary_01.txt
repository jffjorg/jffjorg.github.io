And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Patricia Munoz's counsel to be relieved as attorney of record. The motion was properly filed with the required documents, and the moving counsel's declaration showed a breakdown of the working relationship. Since no opposing document was filed showing prejudice to the client, the judge found sufficient grounds for withdrawal. The judge cited relevant legal authorities, including Lempert v. Sup. Ct. and the California Rules of Court and Rules of Professional Conduct. The judge will sign the proposed order submitted by counsel.
