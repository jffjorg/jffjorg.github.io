  Case Number:  20STCV49401    Hearing Date:   September 21, 2023    Dept:  19 RULING   On the Court’s own motion, the Hearing on Motion for Summary  Judgment is CONTINUED to 10/23/2023, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 19 of the Stanley Mosk  Courthouse.   A portion of Defendants’ evidence filed in support of the  motion improperly contains redactions. (See Martine Singer Decl., Ex. D; accord, James  Colón Decl., Ex. AA.)    “Substantive courtroom proceedings in ordinary civil cases,  and the transcripts and records pertaining to these proceedings, are  presumptively open.” (McNair v. National Collegiate Athletic Association (2015)  234 Cal.App.4th 25, 31; see Cal. R. Ct., 2.500(c) [“Unless confidentiality is  required by law, court records are presumed to be open.”].)    Defendants filed evidence containing redactions without obtaining a court order granting leave  to do so in violation of California Rules of Court, rule 2.551(a). (See  Cal. R. Ct., 2.551(a) [“A record must not be filed under seal without a  court order.”].) The Court cannot consider redacted evidence in support or  opposition of a motion for summary judgment.   As such, the  Court sets a Hearing Re: Sealing of Redacted Evidence ISO MSJ for 10/23/2023, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 19 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. The Court sets this hearing to  give Defendants an opportunity to follow the procedures for filing the records  under seal and to make the requisite showing, (see Cal. R.  Ct., 2.550-2.551), or refile the records in unredacted/unsealed form or  without the redacted/sealed material.    The  memorandum and supporting declaration for the motion to seal must be filed and served on or before 10/02/2023 . (See Cal. R. Ct., 2.551(b)(1) [“A party requesting that a record  be filed under seal must file a motion or an application for an order sealing  the record. The motion or application must be accompanied by a memorandum and a  declaration containing facts sufficient to justify the sealing.”].)   Any  opposition must be filed and served on or before 10/13/2023.   No reply  brief will be permitted, but the Court will hear oral argument responding to  any arguments raised in opposition.    Moving party to give  notice.
