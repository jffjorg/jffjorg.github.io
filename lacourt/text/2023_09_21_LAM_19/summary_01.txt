## English Text Summary 

The judge has continued the hearing on a motion for summary judgment to October 23, 2023. This is because the defendants filed evidence in support of their motion that contained redactions without first obtaining a court order allowing them to do so. 

The judge emphasized that court records are generally open to the public and that redacting information without proper authorization is not allowed. 

The judge has scheduled a separate hearing on October 23rd to address the issue of the redacted evidence. The defendants will have the opportunity to either:

1.  Follow the proper procedures for filing records under seal and justify the need for the redactions.
2.  Re-file the evidence without the redactions.

The judge will not consider the redacted evidence in making their ruling on the motion for summary judgment.

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on the motion for summary judgment to October 23, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 19 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. The judge has taken issue with the defendants' evidence filed in support of the motion, which contains redactions without a court order granting leave to do so. The judge has cited California Rules of Court and a previous court case, McNair v. National Collegiate Athletic Association (2015), to emphasize that court records are presumptively open unless confidentiality is required by law. The judge has given the defendants an opportunity to follow the procedures for filing records under seal and to make the requisite showing, or to refile the records in unredacted or unsealed form. The judge has set a hearing on October 23, 2023, to address the issue of the redacted evidence and has directed the defendants to file a memorandum and supporting declaration by October 2, 2023, and any opposition by October 13, 2023.
