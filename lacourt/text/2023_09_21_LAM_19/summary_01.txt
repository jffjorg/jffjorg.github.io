And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling continues the Hearing on Motion for Summary Judgment to October 23, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 19 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. The judge notes that a portion of the defendants' evidence contains redactions, which violate California Rules of Court, rule 2.551(a). The judge cannot consider redacted evidence in support or opposition of a motion for summary judgment. Therefore, the judge sets a hearing to reconsider the redacted evidence and allows the defendants to refile the evidence in unredacted form. The defendants must file a motion or application to seal the records, accompanied by a memorandum and declaration, by October 2, 2023. The opposition must be filed and served on or before October 13, 2023, and the judge will hear oral argument responding to any arguments raised in opposition.
