  Case Number:  22STCV17929    Hearing Date:   December 31, 2024    Dept:  78 DEPT:   78 OSC DATE:  12/31/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  22STCV17929 REALTY SPECIALTIES, INC. vs FAIZ U. BAIG, et al. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  (1) Raju Masih and (2) Arurkiasami Jruanandam AKA Arockiasamy Jeevanandam AKA Aruckiasami Jevanandam TENTATIVE RULING:   DENY for reasons stated below.  TENTATIVE  The Complaint  Plaintiff Realty Specialties, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) initiated this breach of contract action against defendants Faiz U. Baig (“Baig”), Zeubda K. Faizi (“Faizi”), Mohammad Liaqat (“Liaqat”), Raju Masih (“Masih”), Muzammil Khan (“Khan”), Arurkiasami Jruanandam (“Jruanandam”), and Does 1 to 20. Plaintiff alleges Baig, Faizi, and Liaqat were tenants at the property located at 18621 Pioneer Blvd., Artesia CA 90701 (the "Property") pursuant to a Commercial Lease (the “Lease”) dated June 18, 2012 for a term of fifteen years through June 30, 2027. (Compl. ¶ 2.) Masih and Khan were subtenants at the Property pursuant to a Sublease Agreement dated October 1, 2012 (the “Sublease”) for a term running through June 30, 2027. (Compl. ¶ 3.) Jruanandam was a subtenant at the Property pursuant the Sublease and he agreed to pay $5,880.00 per month in rent pursuant to the Lease. (Compl. ¶ 4.)  The Lease initially provided for payment of monthly rent in the amount of $5,600 per month, plus triple net charges which were calculated at $850 per month, all due on the first of each month. The Lease provided for annual rent increases of 5% per year. As of May 1, 2020, the monthly rent had been increased to $7,879.77 per month. As of May 1, 2021, the monthly rent was $8,273.76. As of May 1, 2022, the monthly rent was $8,687.45. The Lease provides at paragraph 15A that a 5% late fee will be charged for rent that is paid late. (Compl. ¶ 7.)  Defendants breached the Lease by failing to pay rent from May 2020 to the present. (Compl. ¶ 9.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants are indebted in the amount of $233,906.34 as of the date of filing this Complaint, plus $9,971.82 per month until the rent is paid current. (Compl. ¶ 15.) The complaint sets forth two causes of action for breach of contract and common count.  Default Judgment  Defendants Baig and Faizi filed an Answer on June 27, 2022; the action is stayed against these two defendants as of July 29, 2024 due to bankruptcy. On June 6, 2024, Plaintiff dismissed Liaqat and Khan from the action pursuant to a settlement agreement. All unnamed Doe defendants were dismissed on October 28, 2024.  Plaintiff obtained entry of default against Jruanandam on October 24, 2022 and against Masih on July 5, 2023. Shortly thereafter, Jruanandam in pro per filed an Answer to the Complaint without first setting aside default. Entry of default cuts off a party’s right to appear in the action, including by filing pleadings, until default is set aside. (Devlin v. Kearny Mesa AMC/Jeep/Renault, Inc. (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 381, 385-86.) As such, the default against Jruanandam stands.  Plaintiff seeks default judgment against remaining defendants Masih and Jruanandam in the amount of $470,595.42, which is comprised of $343,596.36 in principal damages, $97,225.84 in interest, $1,328.80 in costs, and $28,444.42 in attorney fees.  The request for court judgment filed on October 22, 2024 is denied without prejudice for the following reasons:  In support of the damages sought, Plaintiff submits the declaration of its president Venkatesh Koka (“Koka”). Koka declares that on October 1, 2012, Baig, Faizi, and Liaqat entered into a sublease with Masih and Khan as subtenants for the property through June 30, 2027 for $5,600 + $850 per month. (Koka Decl. ¶ 4.) On February 12, 2016, Liaqat, Masih, and Khan entered into a sub-sublease adding Jruanandam to their sublease for a term of five years, with Jruanandam’s term ending on February 14, 2021. (Koka Decl. ¶ 5.) Plaintiff received monthly rental payment on the Property until May 2020. (Koka Decl. ¶ 6.) Koka declares she made reasonable efforts to relet the property, but was unable to find a new tenant through April 2023. (Koka Decl. ¶ 6.) Koka provides that the amount of rent, late charges, and common area maintenance fees past due is $343,596.36, and provides a table of charges spanning from May 2020 to April 2023 in support thereof. Further, Plaintiff settled part of its claim with Liaqat and Khan, in which Liaqat agreed to pay $25,000 in settlement and Khan agreed to settle for $7,500. (Koka Decl. ¶ 9.)  First, Jruanandam only signed a sublease with the term ending on February 14, 2021. As such, Jruanandam’s liability for past due rent should only be for the period that no rental payment was received from May 2020 through February 14, 2021. However, Plaintiff appears to be seeking damages against both Jruanandam and Masih for rent from May 2020 through April 2023 jointly and severally, which means that each individual party could be fully liable for the entire amount. This exceeds Jruanandam’s individual liability per Plaintiff’s own allegations. Plaintiff is to separately apportion the damages against Jruanandam and Masih, and ensure that Plaintiff is not seeking duplicative damages.  Second, Liaqat and Khan agreed to settle the matter with Plaintiff. Koka provides that Plaintiff has only received $25,300 in payment thus far and avers that it will give Masih and Jruanandam credit for such amount. The amount of credit that Plaintiff must give to defaulting defendants is not the amount actually paid by Liaqat and Khan to date, but the full amount that Liaqat and Khan agreed to pay through the settlement, which equates to $32,500 collectively. Any settlement amount Liaqat and Khan failed to pay is not to be sought against defaulting defendants; Plaintiff’s remedy in the event settling defendants fail to pay is to enforce the settlement agreement against them to recover those amounts. For any credit given to defaulting defendants, Plaintiff is to include those amounts in the chart breaking down the amount of rent sought.  Third, Plaintiff seeks rent from May 2020 until April 2023 against Masih and Jruanandam, but has not dismissed defendants Baig and Faizi. Baig and Faizi filed for bankruptcy, and the action was stayed against them as of July 29, 2024. (Min. Order, July 29, 2024.) Plaintiff must dismiss all parties against whom judgment is not sought or demonstrate that the damages sought against defaulting defendants are severable and not duplicative of damages that could potentially be sought against Baig and Faizi should they not be dismissed from this action. (CRC 3.1800(a)(7).)  Fourth, Plaintiff seeks $28,444.42 in attorneys’ fees pursuant to the provisions of the contract. If attorneys’ fees are awarded on default, they shall be determined in accordance with Local Rule 3.214. The amount of attorneys’ fees sought by Plaintiff exceeds the calculation under Local Rule 3.214.  Lastly, Plaintiff seeks prejudgment interest in the amount of $97,225.84. Plaintiff must provide an interest computation as required by Cal Rules of Ct 3.1800(a)(3). It is unclear to the Court how interest was calculated, such as the time period and the percentage of the interest. Further, because Masih and Jruanandam are not liable for the same amount due to Jruanandam’s sublease expiring earlier than Masih’s, Plaintiff must provide separate interest computations against Masih and Jruanandam.  No later than 02/13/2025, Plaintiff is to submit a new default judgment package correcting these defects. Failure to do so may result in the imposition of sanctions, including monetary sanctions and/or dismissal. The Order to Show Cause Re: Failure to File Default Judgment is continued to 02/20/2025 at 8:30 a.m.
