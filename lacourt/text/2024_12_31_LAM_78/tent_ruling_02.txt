 Case Number:  23STCV19739    Hearing Date:   December 31, 2024    Dept:  78  Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78 ¿ ALEXIS MOORE, et al., Plaintiff(s), vs. KENNEDY WILSON, et al., Defendant(s). Case No.:¿ 23STCV19739 Hearing Date: December 31, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S MOTIONs TO COMPEL FURTHER DISCOVERY RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES AND REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS  I. BACKGROUND Plaintiffs Alexis Moore, Andrea Areiza, Alyse Greene, Dailynn Huerta, Miesha Miller, Milan Harrell, Mohammed Fahad, and Vitu Chea (“Chea”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed their First Amended Complaint against defendants Kennedy Wilson, KW Westmoreland Tic, Inc. dba as The Chadwick, Graystar Real Estate Partners LLC, Greystar California Inc., and Does 1 through 50 for allegations arising from the habitability of rental apartments. On May 15, 2024, KW Westmoreland Tic, LLC, erroneously sued as KW Westmoreland Tic, Inc., (“KW”) filed motions for an order compelling Plaintiff Chea to provide further responses to its special interrogatories, set one, and request for production of documents (“RPDs”), set one. On July 9, 2024, Plaintiff Chea filed oppositions to the motions. On July 15, 2024, KW filed its replies. The motion to compel special interrogatories, set one, was initially heard on October 22, 2024, in which the Court found the motion untimely. In the Court’s tentative ruling, the Court noted that the parties agreed KW’s deadline to file the motion was May 14, 2024, yet the motions were filed one day later on May 15, 2024. The Court has no jurisdiction to review an untimely filed motion to compel further. (Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Ct. (2022) 84 Cal. App. 5th 127, 134.) At the hearing, the Court did not adopt the tentative as the final order and continued the motions to December 31, 2024. The supplemental brief regarding timeliness of the motion (1 page) was due November 8, 2024, and Plaintiff’s reply (1 page) due by November 15, 2024. (Min. Order, Oct. 22, 2024.) On November 8, 2024, KW filed a supplemental brief regarding timeliness of the motions to compel special interrogatories and RPDs. As of November 15, 2024, no supplemental reply has been filed.  II. PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENT Timeliness It is undisputed that KW’s deadline to file was May 14, 2024 pursuant to the parties’ agreement. KW argues the motions were filed on May 14, 2024 via One Legal, but that on the same date, the matter was reassigned from Dept. 61 to Dept. 78, which caused all matters on calendar to be advanced and vacated. KW argues that due to the reassignment, the motions -were rejected on May 15, 2024, and that the motions would have been accepted on the original filing date of May 14, 2024 had it not been for the reassignment. KW’s counsel’s exhibit of the Notice of Case Reassignment and Order filed on June 25, 2024 does not support this argument.  All parties were notified that effective July 3, 2024, that the matter previously assigned to Judge Jill Feeney would be assigned to Judge Michelle C. Kim. (Tofanyan Decl. Ex. 1.) “All matters on calendar in this case will remain set on the dates previously noticed, in the department indicated above unless otherwise ordered by the court.” (Ibid.) The Court reviews the records on its own initiative. It appears that KW’s counsel likely intended to provide a copy of the Notice of Reassignment and Order filed on May 14, 2024. KW filed a peremptory challenge to Judge Lynne M. Hobbs on May 14, 2024. As a result, effective May 14, 2024, the case matter previously assigned to Judge Lynne M. Hobbs in Dept. 61 was assigned to Judge Jill Feeney in Dept. 78. Consequently, all matters on the calendar were advanced, vacated, and to be rescheduled in the newly assigned department. KW provides a copy of the electronic filing rejected, in which One Legal submitted the motions for filing on May 14, 2024 at 3:44 p.m. and 3:48 p.m. (Tofanyan Decl. Ex. 2.) The notice of rejection provides that the filings were rejected because the motions had been vacated by the court. (Ibid.) The Court notes that KW created this situation by filing both a peremptory challenge and its motions all on the same day. Although the filing issue may have arguably been a foreseeable consequence of KW’s actions, the Court will consider the motions timely filed under the circumstances since KW submitted proof that they were submitted for filing on May 14, 2024. Meet and Confer A motion¿to compel further responses “shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.”¿(Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2030.300(b)(1), 2031.310(b)(2).)¿ The declaration must state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented in the motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2016.040.) KW’s counsel declares she emailed Plaintiffs’ counsel for a meet and confer call on April 19, 2024, and received no response. (Wall Decl. ¶ 9.) On April 29, 2024, KW’s counsel followed up with Plaintiffs’ counsel and advised that attempts to call Plaintiffs’ counsel’s office were futile as they could not even leave a voicemail. (Wall Decl. ¶ 10.) Plaintiffs’ counsel responded to the follow up email, but did not address the request to meet and confer. (Ibid.) On April 30, 2024, KW’s counsel sent Plaintiffs’ counsel a letter detailing the deficient discovery responses, but on May 3, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel sent a letter that KW’s right to bring a motion to compel further responses had been waived. (Wall Decl. ¶ 11.) The parties attended an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC), but KW never received supplemental responses. (Wall Decl. ¶¶ 14-15.) The Court finds the meet and confer requirement met. Separate Statement A motion to compel further responses requires a separate statement. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a).)¿¿ Plaintiff Chea argues the separate statements are deficient because Plaintiff Chea is unable to determine the reasons for a compel further to be able to reasonably respond to the motion. The Court has reviewed the reasons provided for each interrogatory and RPD provided for in the separate statement and finds nothing so uncertain about the rationale behind why KW seeks a further response. The Court finds that KW properly filed a separate statement for each motion to compel further responses.  III. DISCUSSION Further Responses to Interrogatories CCP § 2030.300(a) provides, “On receipt of a response to interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following apply:¿¿¿¿ (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.¿¿¿¿ (2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate.¿¿¿¿ (3) An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.” KW seeks further responses to special interrogatories, set one, as to Nos. 1, 3-5, 7, 11, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24-26, 28, 31, 34, 36, 37, 40, 46, 50, 54, 55, 59, 63, 65, 69, 75, 77, 81, 85, 89, 93, 95, 98, 100, 101, 103-105, 108 and 110. Plaintiff Chea contends that counsel has since served responses to KW’s counsel, such that the issue is moot and that there is nothing to compel. Here, Plaintiff does not provide any evidence that supplemental responses were served on KW as to moot the instant motion. Plaintiff Chea does not address the interrogatories at issue on the merits. The Court finds that the responses are either evasive or incomplete, and the objections to be without merit. Therefore, the motion to compel further responses to the identified interrogatories is granted. Further Responses to RPDs CCP § 2031.310 provides, “On receipt of a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any of the following apply: (1) A statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete. (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive. (3) An objection in the response is without merit or too general.” KW seeks further responses to RPDs, set one, Nos. 1-16 and 18-35 on the grounds that CCP section 2031.280 requires that documents or category of documents produced in response “shall be identified with the specific request number to which the documents respond.” However, Plaintiff Chea did not reasonably particularize any specific documents, and instead refers to an entire document production of 600 pages and vaguely states that she is producing “inspection records, repair and pest control requests, pictures and videos…etc.”.  Plaintiff provides no meaningful opposition to the motion. Plaintiff’s opposition does not discuss any of the identified RPDs, but rather copies portions of the arguments made in opposition to the interrogatories. The Court therefore grants KW’s motion to compel further responses to the RPDs. Plaintiff Chea is ordered to serve code-compliant responses to these requests, in which Plaintiff Chea is to make clear which documents are responsive to which requests for production. Sanctions Sanctions are mandatory against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further response. (CCP §§ 2030.300(d); 2031.310(h).)¿ The Court will award monetary sanctions, but not to the full extent requested by KW. For the motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, the Court awards KW three hours to draft the motion, two hours to review the opposition and draft the reply collectively, and one hour to attend the hearing (awarded only once) at KW’s associate rate of $200 per hour for a total of $1,200. For the motion to compel further responses to RPDs, the Court awards KW two hours to draft the motion, and one hour collectively to review the opposition and draft the reply, at $200 per hour for a total of $600.  IV. CONCLUSION KW’s motions to compel Plaintiff Chea to provide further discovery responses to KW’s set one of special interrogatories and RPDs are GRANTED. Plaintiff Chea is ordered to provide code-compliant further verified responses to KW’s set one of discovery as to (1) special interrogatories Nos. 1, 3-5, 7, 11, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24-26, 28, 31, 34, 36, 37, 40, 46, 50, 54, 55, 59, 63, 65, 69, 75, 77, 81, 85, 89, 93, 95, and (2) RPDs Nos. 1-16 and 18-35, within twenty (20) days. Sanctions imposed against Plaintiff Chea and Plaintiff Chea’s counsel, jointly and severally. Plaintiff Chea and/or Plaintiff Chea’s counsel are ordered to pay sanctions to KW, by and through its attorney of record, in the total amount of $1,800, within twenty (20) days.  Moving Party is ordered to give notice.  DATED: December 30, 2024 __________________________ Hon.
