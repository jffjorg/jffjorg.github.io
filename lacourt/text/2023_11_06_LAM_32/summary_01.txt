And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is on a motion for summary judgment or adjudication of a breach of contract claim and a usury defense. The case involves a settlement agreement entered into on July 24, 2019, between Plaintiffs Craig Sallin, et al. and Defendants Joe Samuel Bailey, et al. Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on their breach of contract claim, alleging that Defendants failed to make payments under the agreement. Defendants argue that the settlement agreement waives their usury defense. The judge found that there are disputes of material fact that preclude summary judgment or adjudication on both claims. Specifically, the judge found that there is a triable issue over whether the settlement agreement is tainted by an underlying usurious transaction, whether Plaintiffs made loans subject to usury law, and whether a modification of a non-usurious transaction can be converted to a usurious one. The judge denied the Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment.
