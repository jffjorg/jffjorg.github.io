And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion to compel further responses to the plaintiff's request for production of documents. The plaintiff, Abraham Amouyal, commenced an action against General Motors, LLC (GM) on April 25, 2023, alleging violations of the Song Beverly statute, arising from his purchase of a 2023 GMC Yukon. The Court finds that GM's discovery is overly broad and unduly burdensome and orders GM to produce certain documents, including the "Warranty Policy and Procedure Manual", Recall Notices and Technical Service Bulletins, and other relevant documents. The Court denies all other requests for further production and orders GM to provide supplemental responses within 45 days of the order. The Court also declines to award sanctions, finding that both parties acted with substantial justification.
