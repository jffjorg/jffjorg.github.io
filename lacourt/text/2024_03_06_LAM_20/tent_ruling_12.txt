 Plaintiff Yeum Kam seeks to compel responses to her requests for production, set one, and form interrogatories—employment, set one, propounded on Defendant State of California.  Plaintiff contends that Defendant did not provide responses. Defendant contends that it has now provided responses and that its failure to respond was due to excusable neglect, inadvertence, or mistake such that its waiver of objections should be set aside. In her Reply, Plaintiff contends that Defendant had no right to assert objections and that the responses are otherwise unverified.   Because responses in the form of objections have been served, the Motions to Compel are denied as moot. If the objections are improper due to waiver, a motion to compel further responses should be filed.  Similarly, the Court cannot set aside Defendant’s waiver because that would require a noticed motion.  (See, e.g., Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.300(a).)  Ultimately, the parties should meet and confer. The Court awards Plaintiff reduced sanctions in the amount of $1,000.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
