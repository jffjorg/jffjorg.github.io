And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the Motions to Compel are denied as moot because responses in the form of objections have been served. The Judge also cannot set aside the Defendant's waiver because that would require a noticed motion. The Judge suggests that the parties meet and confer to resolve their disputes. Additionally, the Judge awards the Plaintiff reduced sanctions in the amount of $1,000.
