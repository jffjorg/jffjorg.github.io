And here is the English text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling relates to a dispute between Whitestone Builders, Inc. and Valerie Taylor and Derek Taylor over renovations to a duplex. The Taylors are seeking to quash subpoenas issued by Whitestone to Wells Fargo and PNC Bank. The Judge has reviewed the information presented and has decided to grant the Motion to Quash in part. The Judge has allowed the production of bank statements from 2022 until the present, records of checks deposited by the Taylors, and information about the existence of other accounts. However, the Judge has precluded the production of records of checks written by the Taylors, citing the lack of justification for this request. The Judge has also noted that the Taylors failed to provide any briefing on the work product privilege and that there may be a waiver of this privilege to the extent the Taylors seek reimbursement of consultant fees. The Judge has declined to award sanctions and has encouraged counsel to submit on the tentative or appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
