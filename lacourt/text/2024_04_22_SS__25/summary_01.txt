As for the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

On April 22, 2024, the court issued a tentative ruling on a motion to be relieved as counsel for Elias Shokrian, a defendant in the case. The court granted the motion, finding that all procedural requirements had been satisfied and that there was no indication that withdrawal would cause injustice or undue delay in the proceedings. The court's ruling was based on the California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, and Code of Civil Procedure section 1014. The motion was filed by Counsel Jason M. Stone, who had been representing Shokrian, but had an attorney-client relationship breakdown and could no longer continue representing Shokrian without conflict. The court's ruling is effective until proof of service of the order signed by the court upon the client is filed in this action.
