The judge grants plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of his complaint. The plaintiff's counsel failed to appear at the non-jury trial date due to a calendaring mistake. The judge finds that the plaintiff's absence was a result of his counsel's neglect. As a result, the court grants the motion and orders counsel for the plaintiff to electronically submit a default judgment packet within 30 days. An order to show cause re: plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment is set for June 12, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. in Department 25 of the Spring Street Courthouse.
