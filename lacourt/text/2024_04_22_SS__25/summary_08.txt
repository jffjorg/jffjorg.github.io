English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint to add new causes of action for retaliatory eviction under California Civil Code Section 1942.5 and violation of Los Angeles Municipal Code sections 45.33 and 151.33 and Los Angeles Ordinance No. 187109. The court finds that the amendment is necessary and proper because it rests on the same general set of facts, and the proposed new claims are viable. The court also finds that the amendment will not prejudice the Defendant, as the proposed new claims relate to the same general set of facts and the Defendant has not shown any prejudice. The court grants the motion and orders Plaintiffs to serve and file their First Amended Complaint within 5 days of the ruling.
