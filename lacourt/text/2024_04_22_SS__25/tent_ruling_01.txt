 ====================================================================
 
BACKGROUND 
 
On February 7,
2024, Counsel Jason M. Stone, Esq. (“Counsel”) filed a motion to be relieved as
counsel for Defendants Benbaroukh, LLC (“Benbaroukh”) and Elias Shokrian
(“Shokrian”).
 
On April 11,
2024, the Court noted a separate motion should have been filed for each
individual Defendant. The Court granted the motion in part as to Benbaroukh
only and ordered Counsel to separately serve and file a properly noticed motion
to be relieved as counsel for Shokrian by April 19, 2024. (Minute Order
4/11/24.) 
 
On April 12,
2024, Counsel filed the instant motion to be relieved as counsel for Shokrian
as ordered by the Court. No opposition has been filed as of April 17, 2024. 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
I.          Motion to be Relieved as Counsel
 
The court may
order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or after
judgment or final determination upon request by either client or attorney and
after notice from one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc. § 284, subd. (2).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.) An application to be
relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Forms MC-051 (Notice of
Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) 
 
In addition,
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 subsection (d) requires that the notice
of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case by personal service,
electronic service, or mail. If the notice is served by mail, it must be
accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing that either: 
 
(A) The service
address is the current residence or business address of the client; or 
(B)  The service
address is the last known residence or business address of the client, and the
attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after making
reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the motion to
be relieved. 
 
(Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (1)(A) & (2).) 
 
Under the Code of
Civil Procedure section 1014, “A defendant appears in an action when the
defendant answers, demurs, files a notice of motion to strike, files a notice
of motion to transfer pursuant to Section 396(b), moves for reclassification
pursuant to Section 403.040, gives the plaintiff written notice of appearance,
or when an attorney gives notice of appearance for the defendant. After
appearance, a defendant or the defendant's attorney is entitled to notice of
all subsequent proceedings of which notice is required to be given. Where a
defendant has not appeared, service of notice or papers need not be made upon
the defendant.”
 
II.        Discussion   
 
Counsel properly
filed a Notice of Motion and Motion (MC-051). Counsel also filed a Declaration
in Support of the Motion (MC-052) stating that:
 
There has been an
attorney-client relationship breakdown over the course of the proceeding.
Irreconcilable differences have arisen between Defendant and Cross-Complainant
Elias Shokrian and Counsel which causes undue delay to the proceeding. Counsel
will be unable to continue representing the Defendant and Cross-Complainant
without conflict.
(MC-052, ¶ 2.) On his Form MC-052, Counsel indicates
that he has served the client by mailing copies of the motion papers to the
client’s last known address. (MC-052 ¶ 3a(2).) Counsel avers that the address
provided as the current address of the client was confirmed within the last 30
days by conversation. (MC-052 ¶ 3b(1)(c).) 
Counsel also provides the Court with a Proposed Order,
Form MC-053, which further includes Proof of Service indicating that all
parties have been served with the Notice, Motion, Declaration, and Order.
(MC-053.)
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that all
procedural requirements have been satisfied and that there is no indication
that withdrawal would cause injustice or undue delay in the proceedings. 
III.       Conclusion 
 
Accordingly,
Counsel Stone’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Defendant Elias Shokrian
is GRANTED. 
 
The Court's
Ruling and Attorney's relief as Counsel of record for client Elias Shokrian is
not effective until Proof of Service of the Order signed by the Court upon the
client is filed in this action. Until then, counsel continues to be counsel of
record. Cal. Rules of Court 3.1362(e).
 
Moving Party to
give notice.
