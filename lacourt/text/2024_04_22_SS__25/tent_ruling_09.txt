ANALYSIS 
 
I.          Legal Standard & Discussion  
 
A.    
Determination of “Abandoned Mobilehome”
—Civ. Code § 798.61(a)(1)¿ 
 
Pursuant to Civil Code, section 798.61, subdivision (a)(1),
an “‘abandoned mobilehome’ means a mobilehome about which all of the following
are true:¿ 
¿ 
(A) It is
located in a mobilehome park on a site for which no rent has been paid to the
management for the preceding 60 days.¿ 
(B)  It is
unoccupied.¿ 
(C)  A
reasonable person would believe it to be abandoned.¿ 
(D) It is
not permanently affixed to the land.” 
 
(Civ. Code, § 798.61(a)(1)(A)-(D).) 
Here, Petitioner submits the declaration of
Klarisa Aivazian, property manager for Petitioner. Ms. Aivazian explains that Marietta
Price is the registered owner of the mobilehome currently occupying 1030 E Ave
S Space 36, Palmdale, California 93550, and Sapient Providence LLC is the legal
owner of the mobilehome. (Aivazian Decl., ¶ 5; Ex.
“2.”) The mobilehome stored at 1030 E Ave S Space 36, Palmdale,
California 93550, is currently unoccupied and has been unoccupied prior to July
20, 2023, the date the 30 day Notice of Belief of Abandonment (the “Notice”)
was posted on the mobilehome. (Aivazian Decl., ¶ 6;
Ex. “1”) The Notice was posted on the mobilehome pursuant to Civil Code
Section 798.61 on July 20, 2023 and sent via certified mail on the same day. Further,
the mobilehome is not permanently affixed to the space. (Aivazian Decl., ¶ 7.) 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds the
Mobilehome falls within the Section 798.61 definition of “abandoned.”
 
B.     Notice
of Belief of Abandonment—Civ. Code § 798.61(b) 
 
Civil Code, section 798.61, subdivision (b)
requires:¿ 
 
After determining a mobilehome in a mobilehome park to be an abandoned
mobilehome, the management shall post a notice of belief of abandonment on the
mobilehome for not less than 30 days, and shall deposit copies of the notice in
the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the homeowner at the last
known address and to any known registered owner, if different from the
homeowner, and to any known holder of a security interest in the abandoned
mobilehome. This notice shall be mailed by registered or certified mail
with a return receipt requested.  
 
(Civ. Code, §
798.61(b).) 
 
As provided above, Petitioner’s property manager declares the Notice of Belief of Abandonment was posted on the
mobilehome pursuant to Civil Code Section 798.61 on July 20, 2023 and sent via
certified mail on the same day. (Aivazian Decl., ¶
7.) Petitioner provides Proof of Service that the Notice of Belief of
Abandonment was mailed as such with return receipt requested. (POS 3/18/24; Ex.
“3.”) 
 
Thus, Petitioner has complied with Civil Code section 798.61(b).  
  
 
C.     Petition
for Judicial Declaration—Civ. Code § 798.61(c)¿ 
¿ 
Civil Code section 798.61, subdivision (c)(1) states
that: 
 
Thirty
or more days following posting pursuant to subdivision (b), the management may
file a petition in the superior court in the county in which the mobilehome
park is located, for a judicial declaration of abandonment of the mobilehome. A
proceeding under this subdivision is a limited civil case. Copies of the
petition shall be served upon the homeowner, any known registered owner, and
any known person having a lien or security interest of record in the mobilehome
by posting a copy on the mobilehome and mailing copies to those persons at
their last known addresses by registered or certified mail with a return
receipt requested in the United States mail, postage prepaid. 
 
(Civ. Code, §
798.61(c).)  
 
Petitioner has provided Proof of Service indicating that
the petition was served on the homeowner by posting on the door of the
Mobilehome and by mailing copies to the interested parties last known address
with return receipt requested. (Trevillyan Decl., ¶ 8; POS
3/18/24.) 
 
Thus, the Court finds the service requirements under Civil
Code section 798.61(c) have been satisfied. 
 
 
D.    Charges,
Attorney’s Fees, and Costs¿ 
¿ 
Civil Code section 798.61, subdivision (d)(2) provides
that:¿ 
 
If, at
the hearing, the petitioner shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the
criteria for an abandoned mobilehome has been satisfied and no party
establishes an interest therein at the hearing and tenders all past due rent
and other charges, the court shall enter a judgment of abandonment, determine
the amount of charges to which the petitioner is entitled, and award attorney's
fees and costs to the petitioner.  
 
(Civ. Code, §
798.61(d)(2).) 
 
Petitioner seeks monthly storage charges in the
amount of $400.00 per month owed from August 1, 2021 through March 1, 2024, for
a total amount of $12,400. (Petition ¶ 6; Aivazian Decl., ¶¶ 8, 10.) As evidence, Petitioner submits a copy of the
August 2021 statement showing the $400 per month storage charge. (Aivazian
Decl., ¶ 8; Ex. “4.”) Petitioner
additionally seeks storage cost equal to the rent due and other applicable
charges form the date of judgment up to the date of the sale of the mobilehome
or other disposition, court cost, and attorney’s fees. (Prayer ¶¶ 2-6.) No amount of costs or attorney’s fees is
sought or supported by the evidence. Therefore, costs and attorney’s fees are
to be determined by memorandum of costs and noticed motion, respectively. However, costs of $225 were listed in the request for entry
of default. 
 
Accordingly, judgment to be entered in Petitioner’s favor in the amount
of $12,625 ($12,400 plus $225).
