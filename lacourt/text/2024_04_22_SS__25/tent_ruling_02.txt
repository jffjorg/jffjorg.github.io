ANALYSIS 
 
I.          Motion to Set Aside/Vacate Dismissal
 
Per Code of
Civil Procedure, section 473, subdivision (b), a court may relieve a party or
his counsel from a dismissal against him because of his “mistake, inadvertence,
or excusable neglect.” When a party seeks relief “no more than six months after
entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney's sworn
affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect,
vacate any (1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her
client, and which will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting
default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the
court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the
attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
473) And
when such relief is available, “there is a strong public policy in favor of
granting relief and allowing the requesting party his or her day in court.” (Rappleyea
v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 981-982, internal quotations omitted.) 
 
II.        Discussion   
 
The Court
dismissed Plaintiff’s action on December 15, 2023. Plaintiff filed the instant
motion on March 27, 2024, within the six-month deadline of the Code of Civil
Procedure section 473(b). 
 
On December 15,
2023, a non-jury trial for this matter was scheduled and both parties failed to
appear. The Court dismissed the action without prejudice. Plaintiff and his
counsel failed to appear at the trial date due to a mistaken date of calendar
entry. In support of this, Plaintiff provides the declaration of his counsel,
Alex Park. Counsel declares the following: 
 
Our office effectuated service on
Defendant Scott Housefield on July 5, 2022 via personal service. After
receiving no responsive pleading from Defendant following service, our office
moved to entry of default against Defendant Housefield. A request for entry of
default was entered on April 12, 2023. Due to a calendaring mistake, our office
neglected to properly calendar the trial date for this case. As a result, I
failed to appear at the Non-Jury Trial Date set on December 15, 2023. I
sincerely apologize to the court and to Judge Windham for time and resources
that I have wasted the due to my non-appearance. On or about December 15, 2020,
the court dismissed this case without prejudice for lack of prosecution. If
this motion is granted by the court, our office will prepare and file a default
judgment package within 30 days.
 
(Declaration of
Alex Park, ¶¶ 1-5.) Based on the foregoing, the Court
finds that Plaintiff’s absence on December 15, 2023 was a result of Plaintiff’s
counsel’s neglect. The Court is inclined to grant the motion.  
 
III.       Conclusion 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion is granted. 
 
 
As the Court notes
that Default as to Defendant Scott Housefield is entered herein on 04/12/2023,
Counsel for Plaintiff is ordered to electronically submit the Default Judgment
Packet within 30-dys.
 
An Order to Show
Cause Re:  Plaintiff’s Request for Entry
of Default Judgment is set for 06/12/2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Department 25 of the
Spring Street Courthouse.
