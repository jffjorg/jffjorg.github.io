 Case Number:  24STCP00031    Hearing Date:   March 4, 2024    Dept:  52 Tentative Ruling:
Petitioner
Edward A. Klein’s Petition to Compel Arbitration and Payment of Fees and Costs
Petitioner
Edward A. Klein petitions under Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.97 for an
order compelling arbitration and requiring respondent Pathward, N.A. to pay
fees and costs of arbitration.  Klein also
seeks an award of $8,895 for his expenses incurred making this petition.  Respondent opposes this petition only as to paying
the fees and costs petitioner incurred in making this petition.
Klein
is entitled to an order that respondent shall pay his reasonable expenses
incurred for this petition.  Code of
Civil Procedure section 1281.99(a) provides, “The court shall impose a monetary
sanction against a drafting party that materially breaches an arbitration
agreement pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1281.97 or subdivision (a) of
Section 1281.98, by ordering the drafting party to pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney’s fees and costs, incurred by the employee or consumer as a
result of the material breach.”  
Respondent
materially breached an arbitration agreement pursuant to section
1281.97(a).  Section 1281.97(a)(1)
provides, “In an employer or consumer arbitration that requires, either
expressly or through application of state or federal law or the rules of the
arbitration provider, the drafting party to pay certain fees and costs before
the arbitration can proceed, if the fees or costs to initiate an arbitration
proceeding are not paid within 30 days after the due date the drafting party is
in material breach of the arbitration agreement.”  If the drafting party breaches the arbitration
agreement, the consumer may “[c]ompel arbitration in which the drafting party
shall pay reasonable attorney’s fees and costs related to the
arbitration.”  (CCP §
1281.97(b)(2).)  
Respondent
materially breached the arbitration agreement because it did not pay initiation
fees within 30 days of the due date.  Respondent’s
counsel states, “[O]n December 11, 2023, Respondent received an invoice for
payment from JAMS dated December 4, 2023.  The invoice did not specify any particular due
date, merely that it was ‘due upon receipt.’ ” 
(Delgado Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. 1.)  Respondent
concedes it did not pay within 30 days of receiving that invoice.  
Due
upon receipt means what it says.  “[T]he Legislature intended courts to apply the
statute’s payment deadline strictly.”  (Espinoza
v. Superior Court (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 761, 771.)  Even sending payment within 30 days may not
suffice because the payment “must be received by the arbitrator within
30 days after the due date.”  (Doe v.
Superior Court (2023) 95 Cal.App.5th 346, 350.)  Respondent received the
invoice on December 11, 2023.  Respondent
had to pay within 30 days, by January 10, 2024. 
Failing to do so constituted a material breach of the arbitration
agreement under Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.97(a)(1).  Respondent did not pay until February 1.  (Delgado Decl., ¶ 7.)   
Respondent
argues it did not materially breach the agreement because JAMS extended the
deadline.  Respondent’s counsel states, “[O]n
January 22, 2024, Respondent received a letter from JAMS dated January 8, 2024,
indicating payment was still outstanding and requesting payment within thirty
days.”  (Delgado Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. 2.)  Respondent characterizes this letter as
“extend[ing] Respondent’s deadline to make payment.”  (Opp., p. 3.) 
But the letter states: “If the non-refundable Filing Fee of $1,750 is
not received within 30 days, JAMS will close the file.  This date is not intended to and does not
extend the due date for payment of the outstanding invoice(s).  The outstanding invoice(s) was due upon
receipt.”  (Delgado Decl., Ex. 2.)  
The
letter concerns when JAMS would close its file—not when respondent had to pay
the invoice before its delay constituted a material breach of the arbitration
agreement.  The arbitrator closing the
file and the drafting party breaching the agreement are two different
things.  A material breach by the
drafting party does not require the arbitrator to terminate the
proceeding.  Instead, section 1281.97(b) requires
the employee or consumer to act to enforce the statute: “If the drafting party
materially breaches the arbitration agreement and is in default under
subdivision (a), the employee or consumer may do either of the following: (1) Withdraw
the claim from arbitration and proceed in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.  (2) Compel arbitration in which the
drafting party shall pay reasonable attorney’s fees and costs related to the
arbitration.”  JAMS’s letter in January
2024 did not extend respondent’s deadline to pay under Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281.97.   
Respondent
relies on an unpublished federal case, Miller v. Plex, Inc. (N.D. Cal.,
Jan. 30, 2024, No. 22-CV-05015-SVK) 2024 WL 348820, at *3.  That case is not binding authority.  The court does not find it persuasive.  Miller v. Plex, Inc. relies in part on
the conclusion that “the FAA preempt[ed]” Code of Civil Procedure sections
1281.97 and 1281.98 in the “narrow” circumstances presented.  (Id. at p. *6.)  Binding authority from the Court of Appeal
holds the FAA does not preempt these statutes. 
(Hohenshelt v. Superior Court (Feb. 27, 2024, No. B327524)
___Cal.App.5th___ [2024 Cal.App. LEXIS 127, at *8]; Gallo v. Wood Ranch USA, Inc. (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 621, 643 [“the FAA does not preempt section
1281.97 or section 1281.99”].)
The court must order respondent “to pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees and costs, incurred by”
petitioner “as a result of the material breach.”  (CCP § 1281.99(a).)  The court finds petitioner did not reasonably
incur $8,895 in expenses as a result of respondent’s breach.  Petitioner claims 12 hours of attorney fees
at $700 hourly.  (Rosen Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.)  The relatively simple petition and reply
brief did not reasonably require 12 hours of work.  The court will therefore reduce the award by
$2,100 to represent 9 hours of attorney fees instead of 12.  
Petitioner
Edward A. Klein’s petition to compel arbitration and payment of fees and costs
is granted.  Under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1281.99(a), petitioner shall recover $6,795 in reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees and costs, from respondent Pathward, N.A.
