And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is in favor of Lois Meehan's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, or in the alternative, to substitute Lois Meehan for Gerald Meehan as plaintiff. The motion is granted, and Lois Meehan is permitted to file the second amended complaint forthwith. The court's discretion to permit the amendment is exercised liberally, as per Code of Civil Procedure section 473(a)(1), and the policy favors resolution of all disputed matters in the same lawsuit. The court also notes that the second amended complaint substitutes Lois Meehan as the successor-in-interest for the late plaintiff Gerald Meehan, in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure section 377.31.
