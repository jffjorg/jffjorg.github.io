And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is in response to the demurrer filed by cross-defendants Williams & Ribb LLP and WNR CPA's, Inc. to the cross-complaint filed by cross-complainant Deanna J. Wiebe. The Judge rules that the demurrer to the first and second causes of action (alleging gender discrimination and failure to prevent gender discrimination under the Fair Employment and Housing Act) is sustained with 20 days' leave to amend. The Judge finds that Wiebe failed to allege sufficient facts to support these claims and did not exhaust her administrative remedies.

The Judge overrules the demurrer to the third through sixth causes of action, finding that Wiebe has alleged sufficient facts to support claims of misclassification, failure to pay wages, waiting time penalties, and violation of ERISA section 502(a)(1)(B). The Judge criticizes the cross-defendants' demurrer for failing to identify the legal standard for determining whether Wiebe was an employee under the relevant statutes and for relying on factual assertions extrinsic to the cross-complaint.
