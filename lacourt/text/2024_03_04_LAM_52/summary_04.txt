And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in favor of Petitioner Edward A. Klein's petition to compel arbitration and payment of fees and costs. The respondent, Pathward, N.A., failed to pay initiation fees within 30 days, which constitutes a material breach of the arbitration agreement. The court finds that the respondent's breach requires the petitioner to take action to enforce the statute, which includes compelling arbitration and payment of reasonable expenses. The court awards the petitioner $6,795 in reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees and costs, from the respondent. The court also reduces the award by $2,100 to reflect a more reasonable amount of attorney fees incurred by the petitioner.
