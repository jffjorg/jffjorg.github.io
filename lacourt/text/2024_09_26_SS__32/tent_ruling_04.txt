[1] For
purposes of this motion, the Court considers the Declaration of Geoffrey M.
Goll, filed June 24, 2024 for Plaintiffs’ motion for new trial. 


[2]
Plaintiff’s separate statement of undisputed facts only references the
individuals by title.


[3]
Plaintiffs do not appear to argue that SCE’s actions which purportedly caused
significant turbidity and water temperature fluctuations constituted malice,
oppression, or fraud, but rather appear to argue that its failure to warn
constituted malice, oppression, or fraud. (See Opposition at pp. 16-18.)


[4]
Moreover, Plaintiffs have not established a triable issue of fact that
Defendant acted with knowledge of the probable
dangerous consequences to plaintiff’s interests and deliberately failed to
avoid these consequences.
