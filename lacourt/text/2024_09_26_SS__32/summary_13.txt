And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's second amended complaint with leave to amend. The court finds that the second amended complaint fails to state a cause of action because it does not allege sufficient facts about which county employee owed a duty to the plaintiff, how that employee breached that duty, and caused damages. The court also finds that the plaintiff has not shown how the county's employees or social workers were incompetent or unfit, and therefore, the plaintiff's allegations of vicarious liability are unsupported.

The court grants the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to cure the defects, but warns that many of the defects are not curable by amendment. The plaintiff must file and serve an amended complaint within 30 days. The court also orders the defendant to provide notice of the ruling and file a proof of service of the notice.
