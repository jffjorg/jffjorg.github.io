And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motion by Plaintiffs to Request Relief from Waiver of Trial by Jury. The motion was filed after Plaintiffs failed to timely post jury fees, resulting in the waiver of their right to a jury trial. The Court notes that the deadline for posting jury fees was February 7, 2023, and that Plaintiffs did not post their fees until March 20, 2024.

Plaintiffs argue that granting relief from the waiver would not result in hardship to the Defendants or delay the case. However, the Court finds that the primary consideration is whether granting relief from waiver would result in any hardship to other parties or to the court. In this case, the Court does not find any prejudice to the Defendants or the court from granting relief from the waiver.

The Court grants the motion and orders that Plaintiffs' motion to Request Relief from Waiver of Trial by Jury is GRANTED.
