And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion to continue the trial and all related dates. The defendants had requested a continuance to January 24, 2025, citing the need to complete physical and mental examinations of the plaintiff. However, the court found that there was no good cause to grant the motion, as the fact discovery cut-off had already passed and the defendants had not moved to reopen discovery. The court also noted that the defendants had caused delays in the discovery process themselves by not serving code compliance examination notices. The judge has denied the motion and set the trial date for October 25, 2024.
