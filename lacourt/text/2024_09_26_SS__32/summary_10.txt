The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion of Plaintiff's counsel, Azuka L. Uzoh, to be relieved as counsel. The motion is granted conditionally pending receipt of an amended order. The Court finds that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is a valid reason for withdrawal. However, the Court requires Counsel to take reasonable steps to protect Plaintiff's interests, including providing notice and allowing time for employment of other counsel. The proposed order must be corrected and re-filed within five days. If all parties do not submit on this tentative ruling, they should arrange to appear in-person or remotely at the hearing on September 26, 2024.
