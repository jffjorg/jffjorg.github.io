MOTION
 
On
December 13, 2023, Plaintiff Nehemiah Johnson (“Plaintiff”), by
and through her guardian ad litem Jessica Jasmine Johnson, filed a complaint
against Defendants County of Los Angeles and Does 1 to 50. 
 
On January 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed the first amended complaint.
 
On July 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative second amended
complaint (“SAC”) asserting two causes of action for negligence per se pursuant
to Government Code section 815.6 and vicarious liability for wrongful acts or
omissions by public entity employees under Government Code section 815.2. 
 
Defendant County of Los Angeles (“Defendant”) now demurs to the entire
SAC, arguing (1) the cause of action under section 815.6 fails to state
sufficient facts and is uncertain; and (2) the cause of action under section
815.2 fails to state sufficient facts and is barred by the Tort Claims Act.
Plaintiff opposes and Defendant replies. 
 
LEGAL
STANDARD
 
A demurrer is a pleading used to
test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. 
It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the
opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or cross-complaint).  (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 422.10, 589; see Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  It is not the function of the demurrer to
challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of the ruling on
the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true.  (Donabedian, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.)
 
The general rule is that the plaintiff need only allege
ultimate facts, not evidentiary facts. (Doe v. City of Los Angeles
(2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.) “All that is required of a plaintiff, as a matter
of pleading, even as against a special demurrer, is that his complaint set
forth the essential facts of the case with reasonable precision and with
sufficient particularity to acquaint the defendant with the nature, source and
extent of his cause of action.” (Rannard v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp. (1945) 26 Cal.2d 149,
156-157.) 
 
On demurrer, a trial court has an independent duty to
“determine whether or not the … complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a
cause of action under any legal theory.” (Das v. Bank of America, N.A.
(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 727, 734.) Demurrers do not lie as to only parts of
causes of action, where some valid claim is alleged but “must dispose of an
entire cause of action to be sustained.” (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119.)
 
A
demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the pleading is so bad
that the responding party cannot reasonably respond, i.e., he or she cannot
reasonably determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what claims are
directed against him or her. (Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Where a demurrer is made upon the ground of uncertainty,
the demurrer must distinctly specify exactly how or why the pleading is
uncertain, and where such uncertainty appears by reference to page and line
numbers. (See Fenton v. Groveland Comm. Services Dist. (1982) 135
Cal.App.3d 797, 809.)
 
            Where a demurrer is sustained, leave
to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976)
18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a
pleading can be amended successfully. (Id.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).  
 
MEET
AND CONFER
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41 requires that “[b]efore filing a demurrer pursuant to this
chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd.
(a).) The parties are to meet and confer at least five days before the date the
responsive pleading is due. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(2).)
Thereafter, the demurring party shall file and serve a declaration detailing
their meet and confer efforts. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3).)
 
The Declaration of Danielle C.
Foster, Defendant’s counsel, states that the parties met and conferred via
telephone on July 1, 2024 about the issues in this demurrer. (Foster Decl. ¶
4.) Therefore, the meet and confer requirement is met. 
 
JUDICIAL
NOTICE
 
The
Court grants Defendant’s request for judicial notice. 
 
ANALYSIS
Government Code section
815 provides that “[a] public entity is not liable for an injury, whether such
injury arises out of an act or omission of the public entity or a public
employee or any other person” except as provided by statute. (Gov. Code, § 815,
subd. (a); see Hoff v. Vacaville Unified School Dist. (1998) 19 Cal.4th
925, 932.) “[D]irect tort liability of public entities must be based on a
specific statute declaring them to be liable, or at least creating some
specific duty of care, and not on the general tort provisions of Civil Code
section 1714. Otherwise, the general rule of immunity for public entities would
be largely eroded by the routine application of general tort principles.” (Eastburn
v. Regional Fire Protection Authority (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1175, 1183.)
Consequently, “public entities may be liable only if a statute declares them to
be liable.” (Tuthill v. City of San Buenaventura (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th
1081, 1088 (emphasis in the original).
Moreover, to state a
cause of action [for government tort liability] every fact essential to the
existence of statutory liability must be pleaded with particularity, including
the existence of a statutory duty.” (Searcy v. Hemet Unified School Dist.
(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 792, 802.) “Duty cannot be alleged simply by stating
‘defendant had a duty under the law’; that is a conclusion of law, not an
allegation of fact. The facts showing the existence of the claimed duty must be
alleged. [Citations.] Since the duty of a governmental agency can only be
created by statute or ‘enactment,’ the statute or ‘enactment’ claimed to
establish the duty must at the very least be identified.” (Id.)
Section 815.6
Government Code section 815.6 provides: “[w]here a public entity is
under a mandatory duty imposed by an enactment that is designed to protect
against the risk of a particular kind of injury, the public entity is liable
for an injury of that kind proximately caused by its failure to discharge the
duty unless the public entity establishes that it exercised reasonable
diligence to discharge the duty.” Therefore, “[t]hree requirements must be met
before governmental entity liability may be imposed under Government Code
section 815.6:(1) an enactment must impose a mandatory duty; (2) the enactment
must be meant to protect against the kind of risk of injury suffered by the
party asserting section 815.6 as a basis for liability; and (3) breach of the
mandatory duty must be a proximate cause of the injury suffered.” (Ellerbee
v. County of Los Angeles (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 1206, 1215.) 
 
Whether an enactment creates a mandatory duty is a question of law. (Haggis v. City of Los Angeles (2000) 22 Cal.4th 490, 499.) “Courts have delineated what is necessary to
establish a mandatory duty. ‘First and foremost, … the enactment at issue
[must] be obligatory, rather than merely discretionary or permissive, in
its directions to the public entity; it must require, rather than merely
authorize or permit, that a particular action be taken or not taken.” (State
Department of State Hospitals, et al. v. Superior Court (2015) 61 Cal.4th
339 [alterations and emphasis in original, quotations and citation omitted].)
“It is not enough, moreover, that the public entity or officer have been under
an obligation to perform a function if the function itself involves the
exercise of discretion.” (Id. [emphasis in original, citation
omitted].)
 
Additionally, the first
prong of the statute is construed strictly, “finding a mandatory duty only if
the enactment ‘affirmatively imposes the duty and provides implementing
guidelines.’” (Guzman v. County of Monterey (2009) 46 Cal.4th 887, 898.)
The enactment’s language is the most important guide to determine legislative
intent, but “there are unquestionably instances in which other factors will
indicate that apparent obligatory language was not intended to foreclose a
governmental entity's or officer's exercise of discretion.” (Haggis, supra, 22 Cal.4th at 499.) “In determining
whether a mandatory duty actionable under section 815.6 had been imposed, the
Legislature's use of mandatory language (while necessary) is not the
dispositive criteria. Instead, the courts have focused on the particular action
required by the statute, and have found the enactment created a mandatory duty
under section 815.6 only where the statutorily commanded act did not lend
itself to a normative or qualitative debate over whether it was adequately
fulfilled.” (de Villers v. County of San Diego (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th
238, 260.) 
“[S]ection 815.6 requires
the mandatory duty be ‘designed’ to protect against the particular kind of
injury the plaintiff suffered. The plaintiff must show the injury is ‘one of
the consequences which the [enacting body] sought to prevent through imposing
the alleged mandatory duty.’ [Citation.] Our inquiry in this regard goes to the
legislative purpose of imposing the duty. That the enactment ‘confers some
benefit’ on the class to which plaintiff belongs is not enough; if the benefit
is ‘incidental’ to the enactment's protective purpose, the enactment cannot
serve as a predicate for liability under section 815.6.” (Haggis, supra,
22 Cal.4th at 499.) 
 
“If the first two elements set
out in Government Code section 815.6 are satisfied, ‘the next question is
whether the breach … was the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injury. …
[P]roximate cause has two aspects. ‘One is cause in fact. An act is a
cause in fact if it is a necessary antecedent of an event.’ This is sometimes
referred to as ‘but-for’ causation. The second aspect of proximate cause
‘focuses on public policy considerations.’” 
(State Dept. of State Hosp., 61 Cal.4th at 352-353 [citations and
quotations omitted, emphasis in original].) 
The cases relied on by the lower court in State Department of State
Hospitals “[a]ll held that proximate cause was not established when a
governmental defendant’s failure to act allegedly caused injury, but the chain
of causation included discretionary determinations for which no liability could
be imposed.”  (Id. at p.
353.)  Similarly, in a negligence action,
when “the pleaded facts of negligence and injury do not naturally give rise to
an inference of causation[,] the plaintiff must plead specific facts affording
an inference the one caused the others. That is, the plaintiff must allege
facts, albeit as succinctly as possible, explaining how the conduct caused or
contributed to the injury.” (State Dept. of State Hosp., 61 Cal.4th at
358 (Werdegar, J., concurring) [citing Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co.
(1999) 21 Cal.4th 71, 78].)
Analysis
Here, the SAC generally
alleges that on January 25, 2023, Plaintiff was eight months old and placed
under the care of a foster parent assigned by Defendant and a Doe Social
Worker. (SAC ¶ 11-12.) On this same day, Plaintiff was taken to a hospital to
treat a diaper rash which was present for two days despite the foster parent
stating that she was attempting to treat the rash. (Id.) Plaintiff’s
mother, Jessica Jasmine Johnson, expressed concern to the doctors, law
enforcement, and licensed social worker of possible neglect and/or abandonment
by the assigned foster parent. Plaintiff also alleges she was involved in a
motor vehicle accident on February 1, 2023 while under the care of the foster
parent, causing bodily injuries and severe burns to Plaintiff’s face. (Id.
¶ 13.) 
A. Mandatory Duty
Defendant argues that the
Welfare and Institutions Code sections cited in the SAC do not impose mandatory
duties against the County and/or there are insufficient facts to establish that
the County breached any mandatory duty. In opposition, Plaintiff does not
attempt to justify the inclusion of any of the Welfare and Institutions Code
sections cited in the SAC. Rather, Plaintiff relies on the Department of Social
Services Manual of Policies and Procedures, promulgated pursuant to Welfare and
Institutions Code section 16501. (Scott v. County of Los Angeles (1994)
27 Cal.App.4th 125, 134.)
The SAC and Plaintiff’s
opposition generally refer to “[t]he DSS Manual Division 31 Regulations,” and
specifically refer to sections 31-001.1, 31-101.1, 31-100.3 through 31-100.511.
(FAC ¶¶ 21-23.) However, Plaintiff does not describe what mandatory duties
within those sections are alleged to have been breached. For example, section
31-101 provides that the county “shall respond to all referrals for service
which allege that a child is endangered by abuse, neglect, or exploitation.”
The SAC does not describe how the County failed to respond to a referral for
service, and how such failure was the proximate cause of the injury suffered.
As discussed above, Plaintiff must describe the elements of Government Code
section 815.6, including specifically the alleged mandatory duty and the breach
of the mandatory duty as the proximate cause of the injury suffered, with
sufficient particularity.
B. Vicarious Liability

Government Code section
815.2 states in relevant part, “[a] public entity is liable for injury
proximately caused by an act or omission of an employee of the public entity
within the scope of his employment if the act or omission would, apart from
this section, have given rise to a cause of action against that employee or his
personal representative.” (Gov. Code, § 815.2, subd. (a).) “When assessing a
claim for vicarious liability against a governmental employer based on the acts
or omissions of its employee, a court must examine whether the employee who
acted or failed to act would have been personally liable for the injury.” (de
Villers v. County of San Diego (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 238, 249.) 
To bring an action for
negligence, the plaintiff must show the existence of a duty of care, a breach
of that duty, and the proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury. (Hayes
v. County of San Diego (2013) 57 Cal.4th 622, 629.) 
In the second cause of
action, which is for vicarious liability “and/or Retention of Unfit Employee”,
Plaintiff alleges Defendant’s employees and social workers were incompetent and
unfit. (SAC ¶ 41.) Additionally, Plaintiff alleges “Defendants had the duty to
hire, retain, manage, train, instruct, and supervise their employees, agents,
social workers and caseworkers to ensure that they did not jeopardize the
health and safety of Plaintiff.” (Id. ¶ 44.)
The Court finds that the
SAC fails to describe sufficient facts about which County employee owed a duty
to Plaintiff, how that employee breached that duty, and caused damages.  
The SAC also contains
some allegations suggesting a cause of action for negligent hiring, retention,
and supervision. Plaintiff provides no statutory basis for this cause of action
and fails to show how it can be asserted. (See de Villers v. County of San
Diego (2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 238, 256 [“[A] direct claim against a
governmental entity asserting negligent hiring and supervision, when not
grounded in the breach of a statutorily imposed duty owed by the entity to the
injured party, may not be maintained.”].)
C. Leave to Amend
“Where the complaint is defective, [i]n the
furtherance of justice great liberality should be exercised in permitting a
plaintiff to amend his [or her] complaint…However, if the plaintiff's causes of
action is [sic] not viable, leave to amend should not be granted if there is no
basis for the court to conclude further amendment would cure the defects.” (Favila
v. Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 189, 211, internal
quotations omitted.) If the demurrer is sustained, plaintiff “has the burden of
proving the possibility of cure by amendment.” (Czajkowski v. Haskell &
White, LLP (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 166, 173, citing Grinzi v. San Diego
Hospice Corp. (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 72, 78-79).
 
Although the Court is concerned that many of the
defects identified in the SAC are not curable by amendment, the Court will
permit Plaintiffs leave to amend given the liberal policy of amendment in this
state.
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s
second amended complaint with leave to amend. Any amended complaint must be
filed and served within 30 days.
 
Defendant shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file a proof
of service of such.
