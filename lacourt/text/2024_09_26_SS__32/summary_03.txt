And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered a motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication regarding a wrongful death and survival action brought by the estate of Jonathyn Bradford and his mother, Brandee Vasquez, against Southern California Edison Company. The motion was filed by the defendant, who argues that it did not owe a duty to the decedent and that the plaintiff's claims are barred by recreational immunity.

The court granted the motion for summary adjudication on the issue of punitive damages, finding that the plaintiff did not present sufficient evidence to show that an officer, director, or managing agent of the defendant perpetrated, authorized, or knowingly ratified oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious conduct.

The court denied the motion for summary judgment, finding that there are triable issues of fact regarding the defendant's duty to the decedent and the plaintiff's claims of negligence and breach of duty.

The court notes that the defendant's failure to provide signs or warnings about hazards, failure to provide a lifeguard or rescue equipment, and failure to investigate the causes of prior drownings at Shaver Lake raise triable issues of fact regarding the defendant's duty to the decedent.

The court also notes that the plaintiff's claims of malice and despicable conduct against the defendant are not supported by sufficient evidence and are therefore not sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.
