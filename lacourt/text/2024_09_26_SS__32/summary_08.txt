And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel responses from the plaintiff, Amanda Pham, to special interrogatories and a request for production of documents. The defendant, Universal Protection Service, LP, served the interrogatories and request for production on June 13, 2024, and the responses were due on July 18, 2024. However, the plaintiff failed to respond. The judge is granting the defendant's motion to compel responses and ordering the plaintiff to provide verified responses, without objections, within 30 days.

The judge is also awarding the defendant $825.00 in monetary sanctions against the plaintiff, which is a reduced amount from the $1,100 requested. The judge finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond warrants sanctions, but the amount requested is excessive given the circumstances. The judge orders the plaintiff to pay the sanctions to the defendant's counsel within 30 days.
