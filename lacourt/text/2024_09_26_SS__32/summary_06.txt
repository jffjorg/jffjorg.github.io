And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the complaint without prejudice. The Plaintiff's counsel, Brian P. Tapper, filed the motion, stating that he mis-calendared the hearing date and as a result, the Plaintiff failed to appear at the hearing. The judge finds that this calendaring error constitutes excusable neglect and grants the motion. The judge sets an Order to Show Cause Re Monetary Sanctions/ Dismissal for Failure to Enter Default Judgment for November 4, 2024, and requires the Plaintiff to provide notice and file a proof of service of the default package at least five court days in advance.
