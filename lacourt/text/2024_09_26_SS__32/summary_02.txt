And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to remove Tavis Lurry as guardian ad litem for Khalon Madison. The court finds that Lurry and Nakeithia Robinson, the biological mother of Khalon Madison, have separated and Lurry is not the biological father of Khalon Madison. Therefore, the court determines that Lurry is no longer a suitable guardian ad litem for Khalon Madison. The court also notes that the application to appoint Nakeithia Robinson as guardian ad litem must be filed separately and corrected to use the updated 2024 form.
