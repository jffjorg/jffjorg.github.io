And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by plaintiffs Joselyn Pham, Steven Uy, and Jeffrey Zhu to grant relief from the potential waiver of trial by jury. The plaintiffs had failed to pay the required jury fee of $150 in a timely manner, which resulted in the waiver of their right to a jury trial. However, the plaintiffs argue that they will suffer no prejudice if relief from the waiver is granted, as both sides had anticipated a jury trial in the case. The judge has granted the motion, finding that there will be no prejudice to either party or the court if a trial by jury is granted. The judge has ordered that the plaintiffs provide notice of the court's ruling and file a proof of service.
