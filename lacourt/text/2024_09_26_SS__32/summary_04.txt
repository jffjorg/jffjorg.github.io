And here is a summary in English text:

This tentative ruling discusses a motion for a new trial filed by the plaintiffs. The court considers a declaration filed by Geoffrey M. Goll on June 24, 2024. The plaintiffs argue that the defendant's failure to warn caused significant turbidity and water temperature fluctuations, and that this failure was malicious, oppressive, or fraudulent. However, the court finds that the plaintiffs have not established a triable issue of fact that the defendant acted with knowledge of the probable dangerous consequences to the plaintiffs' interests and deliberately failed to avoid these consequences.
