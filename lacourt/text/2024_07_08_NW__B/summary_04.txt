And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Defendant Karen Solomon's motion to continue the trial to March 4, 2025 is granted. The trial was previously set for September 18, 2024, but the judge has decided to grant the continuance due to several reasons. First, the discovery cut-off date is August 19, 2024, and two of Plaintiff's motions to quash subpoenas are not set to be heard until August 2, 2024. The outcome of these motions will determine whether Plaintiff needs to produce the requested records or Defendant Solomon needs to reissue subpoenas. Second, depositions of witnesses have not been completed due to scheduling issues. Finally, Plaintiff has placed her medical condition at issue in this case, and complete records for her surgery and other treatment related to the alleged injuries are relevant to determine the veracity of her claims. The judge has exercised its discretion and granted the continuance to allow for a trial on the merits.
