The Judge, Hon. Karen Moskowitz, has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to continue the trial in the case of Hiben Arches versus Diane Inha Lee and DOES 1 to 50. The Plaintiff, Hiben Arches, filed a Complaint on April 5, 2022, alleging causes of action for motor vehicle and general negligence. The Plaintiff then moved to continue the trial on May 10, 2024. However, the Court notes that the trial date was already continued to August 19, 2024, making the current motion moot. Therefore, the Judge is taking the motion off calendar and ordering the Plaintiff to give notice. The case is scheduled to be heard on August 19, 2024.
