[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING MOTION
  FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS 
 
Dept. B
8:30 A.M. 
July 8, 2024



Background
Plaintiff filed a complaint on September 7,
2021.  Plaintiff’s complaint does not
allege any causes of action.  Plaintiff
attaches a police report for battery as an attachment to the complaint.  
 
Discussion
1.    
No POS 
On April 22, 2024, self-represented plaintiff Richard Harris
(“Plaintiff”) filed the instant “Motion for Judgment on Pleadings”, setting the
hearing date for May 29, 2024.  The
hearing was continued from May 29, 2024 to June 3, 2024.  The hearing was continued from June 3, 2024
to July 8, 2024 pursuant to an oral stipulation of the parties.  
 
Plaintiff has still not filed a
proper POS of this motion, nor have Defendants filed an opposition.  Plaintiff has been given ample opportunity to
file POS of this motion on Defendants. 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is denied for failure
to properly serve Defendants.
 
2.      Plaintiff fails to establish entitlement to
judgment on the pleadings
“Judgment on the pleadings is akin
to a demurrer and is properly granted only if the complaint does not state
facts sufficient to state a cause of action against that defendant.  The grounds for the motion must appear on the
face of the complaint, and in any matters subject to judicial notice. The court
accepts as true all material factual allegations, giving them a liberal
construction, but it does not consider conclusions of fact or law, opinions,
speculation, or allegations contrary to law or judicially noticed facts.  Appellate courts review the record de novo to
determine whether the complaint states a cause of action as a matter of
law.”  (Shea Homes Limited Partnership
v. County of Alameda (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1246, 1254.)
 
A CCP §438 Motion for Judgment on
the Pleadings “may only be made on one of the following grounds:  (A) If the moving party is a plaintiff, that
the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause or causes of action
against the defendant and the answer does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a defense to the complaint.” 
CCP §438(c)(1)(A).  However, a
common law motion for judgment on the pleadings without such restrictions is
still recognized.  (Cordova v. 21st
Century Ins. Co. (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 89, 109.) 
 
“A plaintiff’s motion for judgment
on the pleadings is analogous to a plaintiff’s demurrer to an answer and is
evaluated by the same standards.  The
motion should be denied if the defendant’s pleadings raise a material issue or
set up affirmative matter constituting a defense; for purposes of ruling on the
motion, the trial court must treat all of the defendant’s allegations as being
true.”  (People ex rel. Becerra v.
Superior Court (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 486, 499.)  Demurrer to an answer must be overruled if
any defense to the complaint is properly alleged.  (South Shore Land Co. v. Petersen
(1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 733–734 (demurrer to answer properly overruled based
on sufficiently pled general denial) (“if one of the defenses or counterclaims
is free from the objections urged by demurrer, then a demurrer to the entire
answer must be overruled”).  
 
An answer fails to raise any
material issue or state a defense where it expressly or substantially admits or
does not sufficiently deny all the material allegations of the complaint and
sets up no new matter that is sufficient to bar or defeat the action.  (Adjustment Corp. v. Hollywood Hardware
& Paint Co. (1939) 35 Cal.App.2d 566, 569-570.)  Thus, a general denial contained in the
answer requires that the entire demurrer be overruled.  (People ex rel. Becerra, supra, 29
Cal.App.5th at 499 (discussing MJP based on failure to state facts to
constitute a defense); Engine Manufacturers Assn. v. State Air Resources Bd.
(2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 1022, 1034 (MJP must be denied if “defendant's pleadings
raise a material issue or set up affirmative matter constituting a defense”); Allstate
Ins. Co., supra, 160 Cal.App.3d at 331 (MJP should be denied if answer
either contains general denial or states facts in support of affirmative
defenses); Barasch v. Epstein (1957) 147 Cal.App.2d 439, 443 (“[w]here
the answer, fairly construed, suggests that the defendant may have a good
defense, a motion for judgment on the pleadings should not be granted”).
 
A plaintiff’s motion for judgment
on the pleadings tests (1) whether the plaintiff’s complaint states a cause of
action and (2) whether the defendant’s answer states sufficient facts to
constitute a defense against the complaint. 
Plaintiff’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings fails to address either
of these issues.  Plaintiff merely cuts
and pastes blocks of law regarding the elements of fraud, assault, battery and agency
liability.  Plaintiff does not address
whether his complaint states a cause of action, nor does he address whether
Defendants’ answer states sufficient facts to constitute a defense against the
complaint.  On its face, Plaintiff’s
complaint does not allege any cause of action and it is uncertain what he is
alleging against Defendants.  As such,
Plaintiff fails to establish entitlement to judgment on the pleadings.  
Plaintiff’s Motion for Judgment on
the Pleadings iS DENIED. 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.

day of July 2024
