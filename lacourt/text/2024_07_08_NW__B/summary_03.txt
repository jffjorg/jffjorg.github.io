Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The plaintiff, Richard Harris, failed to properly serve the defendants, HB Land Enterprises LLC, and did not file a proper points and authorities (POS) in support of his motion. The judge also found that the plaintiff's complaint does not allege any causes of action and does not address whether the defendants' answer states sufficient facts to constitute a defense against the complaint. The judge cited various cases to support her decision, including those that discuss the standards for granting a motion for judgment on the pleadings and the requirements for a proper answer. The judge ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the denial of his motion.
