The Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed
Claim filed on April 22, 2024 is GRANTED.
Claimant Dennis Miles-Patton (“Claimant”), a minor, sustained an injury while participating
in Physical Education in the workout area at the Charles W. Elliot Arts Magnet
Academy (“Defendant”). Claimant has agreed to settle his
claims against Defendant for the total amount of $37,500. If the settlement is
approved, $9,218.01 will be used for attorneys’ fees, and $627.99 will be used
for costs.  
 
On April 8, 2024, the Court denied the Petition
to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim for the following reasons: (1) Attachment
13a (declaration from attorney explaining the basis for the attorney fees
requests) must be provided; and (2) the disposition of the net balance of $27,654.00
in Item 18 has not been properly completed and attachment 18b(2) must be
provided. 
On April 22, 2024, Petitioner filed a new
petition.
The
Court has reviewed the new petition and finds that it addresses the above noted
defects. Therefore, the Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed
Claim filed on April 22, 2024 is GRANTED.
The
Court sets an OSC for August 15, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. for proof of deposit. (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 7.953(a).) If an acknowledgement of receipt by the financial
institution is filed before that date, no appearance will be required.
Per
California Rules of Court, Rule 7.952, Petitioner and Claimant must appear at
the hearing, unless the Court finds good cause to excuse their appearance. The
Court finds that Claimant’s appearance is not necessary, but will require
Petitioner to appear.
Moving
party to give notice.
