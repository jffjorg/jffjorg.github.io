And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Arbol's motion for summary judgment, dismissing the lawsuit filed by Plaintiff Richard Cabrera-Lara. The judge found that Defendant Arbol did not owe Plaintiff a duty of care, did not breach a duty of care, and did not cause Plaintiff's injuries. The judge also found that Defendant Arbol cannot be held vicariously liable for Plaintiff's injuries.

The judge's ruling is based on the undisputed facts presented by Defendant Arbol, which show that it was not involved in the construction project where Plaintiff was injured, did not have any employees or agents at the project site, and did not own, lease, operate, or control the equipment that allegedly caused Plaintiff's injuries.

The judge also noted that Plaintiff failed to oppose the motion, which means that Plaintiff has conceded all of the arguments raised by Defendant Arbol. As a result, the motion is granted, and the lawsuit is dismissed.
