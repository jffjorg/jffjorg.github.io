And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge regarding a petition to confirm a minor's compromise. The case involves Dennis Miles-Patton, a minor, who sustained an injury while participating in physical education at Charles W. Elliot Arts Magnet Academy. The minor has agreed to settle his claims against the academy for $37,500, which will be used to pay attorneys' fees and costs. The court had previously denied a similar petition due to incomplete information, but the new petition addresses these defects and is therefore granted. The court sets an OSC (Order to Show Cause) for August 15, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. for proof of deposit, and requires Petitioner Parrisha Miles to appear at the hearing, but finds that Claimant Dennis Miles-Patton's appearance is not necessary.
