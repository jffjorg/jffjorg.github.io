Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to amend the complaint to correct the plaintiff's name to OBI National Insurance Company a/s/o Ben Larbi and Company LLC. The plaintiff had argued that it was a subrogee of One Beacon An Intact Company and that the currently named plaintiff, Atlantic Specialty Insurance Company, was not the correct party to be listed as plaintiff. However, the judge declined to apply CCP §116.560, which applies to correcting a defendant's name, to correcting a plaintiff's name. The judge also found that the plaintiff was attempting to substitute in a different plaintiff, rather than correcting a mistake in the name of the plaintiff, and therefore denied the motion without prejudice.
