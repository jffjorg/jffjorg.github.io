Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion to vacate the dismissal of the case, which was entered on August 3, 2023. The dismissal was the result of counsel's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, and/or excusable neglect. The plaintiffs, DOUGLAS PAUL SALAZAR and PAUL SALAZAR, filed a complaint against defendant DENISE SMITH for motor vehicle negligence and negligence. The case was dismissed after counsel mistakenly filed a notice of settlement, which was not valid as the other plaintiff, PAUL SALAZAR, was not yet ready to settle. The court finds that relief from dismissal is mandatory based on the circumstances and has granted the motion.
