RULING
            The motion for reconsideration is

BACKGROUND
On January 10, 2023, plaintiff
Hector Gutierrez (self-represented) filed a complaint against defendant Inner
City Education Foundation for (1) general negligence, (2) intentional tort, and
(3) sexual assault and battery.  
On April 18, 2023, the court
sustained defendant’s demurrer with leave to amend.
On May 9, 2023, plaintiff filed a
FAC for (1) general negligence, (2) NIED, (3) IIED, (4) sexual assault against
Doe 4, (5) sexual battery against Doe 4, and (6) malice.
On July 14, 2023, the court
continued defendant’s demurrer to the FAC to August 15, 2023, based on
plaintiff’s oral request for continuance due to medical emergency.  The minute order reflects that no further
continuances would be granted without a declaration from a doctor.
On August 15, 2023, the court
considered the demurrer and plaintiff’s response and sustained the demurrer
without leave to amend.
On August 31, 2023, a judgment of
dismissal was entered.
On September 27, 2023, plaintiff
filed a motion for reconsideration.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
Under CCP §1008(a), “When an
application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused
in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any
party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the party of
written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made
the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order.  The party making the application
shall state by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what
judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts,
circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.” 
As stated by the court in Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32 Cal.
App. 4th 1494, CCP §1008 governs reconsideration of court orders whether
initiated by a party or the court itself. 
“It is the exclusive means for modifying, amending or revoking an order.  That limitation is expressly
jurisdictional.”  Id. at 1499.    
CCP §128(a) states, “Every court
shall have the power to do all of the following: . . . (8) To amend and control
its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. . . .”
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff
requests that the court reconsider its order dated August 15, 2023, sustaining
the demurrer to the FAC without leave to amend.
It
appears that plaintiff is contending that on August 9, 2023, defense counsel
agreed to a continuance of the August 15, 2023 demurrer hearing to September
19, 2023, but appeared and went forward with the August 15, 2023 hearing
anyway.  
Although
plaintiff did not appear at the August 15 hearing, the court considered his
response.  
The court
notes that on July 14,
2023, the court continued the hearing on defendant’s demurrer to the FAC to
August 15, 2023, and that no further continuances would be granted without a
declaration from a doctor.  Plaintiff
does assert that he attempted to file a request for a continuance with a
doctor’s note but that he was unable to file it before the hearing.  He attaches it to his motion.  Dated August 10, 2023, it states:  “The patient, Hector Gutierrez, is currently
under my care.  The Patient suffers from
a medical condition that would serve as a hardship for him to currently
continue with his court case.”’
In the opposition, defendant argues
that the motion is untimely as it was not filed within ten days of service upon
entry of order.  Defendant served and
filed the notice of ruling on August 15, 2023, the date of the hearing.  Judgment of dismissal was entered on August
31, 2023.  The motion for reconsideration
was not filed until September 27, 2023, beyond the ten days after notice of the
ruling.  Further, it was filed after
judgment was entered, and thus, defendant argues, the court does not have
jurisdiction to reconsider.  Defendant
further argues that there are no new or different facts, circumstances, or
law.  In any event, the email
correspondence between plaintiff and defense counsel reflects that defense
counsel had agreed to a continuance of plaintiff’s discovery responses.  In an email dated August 9, 2023 to defense
counsel, plaintiff asked, “I’m reaching out to see if you guys would be willing
to stipulate to another continuance to Tuesday, September 19, 2023.  I spoke with Mr. Walker and told him I would
work diligently on the discovery but I just can’t do it due to the IV medicines
and stamina issues [I] have when trying to get it done.  I need more time.”  Defense counsel responded, “Absolutely.  I have no problems if you need more
time.”  Also, before the August 15, 2023
hearing, on August 13, defense counsel explained to plaintiff in an email that
she had provided an extension to respond to discovery and that the prior emails
did not refer to any continuance of the demurrer hearing.
            The
court finds that the motion is untimely filed and that the court lacks
jurisdiction to rule on it as judgment has been entered.  
            Accordingly,
the motion is DENIED.
            Defendant
is ordered to give notice of ruling.
