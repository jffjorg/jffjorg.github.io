And here is the English summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the motion for reconsideration filed by plaintiff HECTOR GUTIERREZ, who seeks to revive his case against defendant INNER CITY EDUCATION FOUNDATION. The plaintiff argues that the court's order sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend was made in error, citing an alleged agreement between defense counsel and himself to continue the demurrer hearing to September 19, 2023. However, the court finds that the motion is untimely filed, as it was not filed within 10 days of the notice of entry of the order, and that the court lacks jurisdiction to rule on it since judgment has been entered. The court also notes that the email correspondence between the parties reflects that defense counsel had agreed to a continuance of the discovery responses, but not of the demurrer hearing. The motion is therefore denied.
