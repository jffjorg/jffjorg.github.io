Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of JG Builders, Inc. vs. Kimberly Cates and Nancy Dodd. The defendants demurred to the complaint, arguing that the plaintiff, JG Builders, Inc., does not have legal capacity to sue and that the allegations are insufficient to constitute a breach of contract. The plaintiff alleges that it is a party to the contract, but the court finds that the allegations are insufficient to establish this.

The contract was executed by EcoSmart Builders, LLC, and there is no mention of JG Builders, Inc. in the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff is not a party to the contract and sustains the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend.

The court notes that the plaintiff's CEO, Jose Guadalupe Ramirez, was not required to sign the contract, and that the company can designate other individuals to execute contracts and is not required to use its address. The court also notes that the plaintiff's corporate documents do not mention EcoSmart Builders, LLC.

The court cites several cases, including Opp v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. (2007), to support its ruling. The court finds that the plaintiff's allegations are insufficient to establish that it is a party to the contract and sustains the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend.
