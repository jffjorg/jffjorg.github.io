And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion to compel filed by the defendants, Zarna Surti and Tarun Surti, against the plaintiff, Cashmine Crawford. The motion is to compel the plaintiff to respond to discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and a demand for inspection and production of documents. The defendants assert that the discovery requests were properly served, but the plaintiff failed to respond. The plaintiff's counsel claims that they have been attempting to communicate with the plaintiff regarding the discovery requests, but have been unable to reach her.

The judge grants the motion, ordering the plaintiff to respond to the discovery requests without objections within 60 days. The judge also orders the plaintiff to pay $500 in sanctions to the defendants for their costs in bringing the motion. The judge finds that the plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests, despite proper service, and that the defendants' discovery requests were reasonably served. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's counsel attempted to communicate with the plaintiff regarding the discovery requests, but was unable to reach her.
