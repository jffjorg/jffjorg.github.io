Summary:

The court issued a tentative ruling sustaining the defendant's demurrer with 20 days leave to amend. The plaintiff, Susan Nevens, filed a complaint alleging violations of the California Labor Code and seeking civil penalties and attorney's fees and costs on behalf of herself, the state of California, and all individuals who worked for the defendant as hourly-paid and/or non-exempt employees. The defendant filed a demurrer arguing that the plaintiff does not have standing to bring the PAGA claim because she was not an "aggrieved employee" as defined by the California Labor Code. The court found that the plaintiff does not have standing to bring the PAGA claim because she was not employed by the defendant at the time of the alleged violations and therefore did not have a direct interest in the alleged violations. The court also found that the plaintiff's argument and cited authority were not persuasive.
