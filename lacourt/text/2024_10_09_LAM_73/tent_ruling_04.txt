TENTATIVE RULING
 
The Court
SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On April 5, 2024, Plaintiff Susan Nevens, individually, and on
behalf of aggrieved employees pursuant to the California Private Attorneys
General Act, filed this action against Defendant 90210 Surgery Medical Center
LLC, dba Linden Surgical Center of Beverly Hills (“Defendant” or “90210 SMC”).
 
The Complaint alleges the following. This is an enforcement action
under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of 2004,
California Labor Code sections 2698, et seq. (“PAGA”) to recover civil
penalties on behalf of Plaintiff, the State of California, and all individuals
who worked for Defendants in the State of California as hourly-paid and/or
non-exempt employees at any time during the period from December 4, 2022 to
final judgment (“Aggrieved Employees”). (Complaint, ¶ 1.) Plaintiff alleges
that Defendants hired Plaintiff and Aggrieved Employees but failed to properly
pay them all wages owed for all time worked (including minimum wages, straight
time wages, and overtime wages), failed to provide them with all meal periods
and rest periods and associated premium wages to which they were entitled,
failed to timely pay them all wages due during their employment, failed to
timely pay them all wages due upon termination of their employment, failed to
provide them with accurate itemized wage statements, failed to maintain
accurate payroll records, and failed to reimburse them for necessary business
expenses. (Complaint, ¶ 2.) Plaintiff seeks to recover all available remedies
under PAGA, including, but not limited to, civil penalties and attorney’s fees
and costs. (Complaint, ¶ 3.)
 
On June 20, 2024, Defendant
filed a demurrer to the Complaint, arguing:
·       Plaintiff
cannot bring the instant PAGA matter. PAGA Requires the Named Plaintiff to Have
Been an “Aggrieved Employee” to Have Standing to Pursue Any Claims Under the
PAGA, and Plaintiff, by Definition, Is Not an “Aggrieved Employee” under the
PAGA.
o  
Under the PAGA, an “aggrieved employee” is defined to be a “person
who was employed by the alleged violator and against whom one or more of the
alleged violations was committed.” (Labor Code § 2699 (emphasis added).)
o  
The Alleged Violation Occurred After Plaintiff’s Employment with
90210 SMC Ended.
·       Plaintiff
alleges her employment with 90210 SMC ended in or around June 2022. Plaintiff
attempts to establish herself an “aggrieved employee” because she alleges in or
around December 2023, e.g., approximately 1.5 years after her employment ended,
90210 SMC allegedly did not timely produce to her certain records under Labor
Code sections 226(c), 432 and/or 1198.5. However, Plaintiff was not an employee
of 90210 SMC at the time the purported request(s) was/were made, nor within the
year prior to her submission of the requisite notice letter, meaning she does
not facially/in the first instance have standing to bring any claims under the
PAGA as to 90210 SMC.
·       In the
alternative, Plaintiff does not have standing nor is an “aggrieved employee” to
pursue a PAGA cause of action because the grounds on which she contends she can
pursue same are not actionable under the PAGA.
o  
In this matter, Plaintiff appears to base her PAGA claim on the
purported failure/alleged violation of Labor Code § 226(c). However,
a purported violation of Labor Code § 226(c) (and, in an analogous manner, §
432 and/or § 1198.5) is not actionable under the PAGA.
 
Plaintiff filed an opposition, arguing:
·       Defendant’s interpretation
of the PAGA adds requirements to the statute that are inconsistent with: (i)
the clear language of PAGA; (ii) the Legislature’s expressed intent in enacting
PAGA; and (iii) binding California Supreme Court precedent interpreting the
requirements of PAGA.
o  
Defendant has failed to cite a single case where a Court dismissed
a PAGA action under such circumstances
·       PAGA’s
standing requirement is codified at Labor Code section 2699(c), which defines
“aggrieved employee” as “any person who was employed by the alleged violator
and against whom one or more of the alleged violations was committed.”
Defendant has pointed to no language in the statute that requires the violation
to have occurred while the employee was actively employed by the defendant or
within one year of the employee’s termination from employment with the
defendant.
·       The
Legislature Intended PAGA to Apply Broadly
o  
The statutory provisions of the Labor Code are to be liberally
construed in favor of protecting employees. Brinker Restaurant Corp. v.
Superior Court, 53 Cal.4th 1004, 1026-27 (2012)
·       Defendant’s
Argument Is Contrary to California Supreme Court Precedent
o  
As the California Supreme Court has stated, “the plain language of
section 2699(c) has only two requirements for PAGA standing: [t]he plaintiff
must be an aggrieved employee, that is, someone ‘who was employed by the
alleged violator’ and ‘against whom one or more of the alleged violations was
committed.’” Kim, 9 Cal.5th 83-84 (quotations in original); see also Labor Code
section 2699(c)(1).
·       Violations of
Labor Code Sections 226 and 1198.5 Are Actionable Under PAGA
 
Defendant filed a reply, arguing:
·       Plaintiff’s
cited case law does not support her contention that she has standing to bring
the instant PAGA matter
·       Here, while
Plaintiff was an employee of 90210 SMC at some point in time, she was not
subjected to a requisite violation while she was an employee of 90210 SMC.
·       Plaintiff’s
request for certain records was made outside and after her employment
relationship with 90210 SMC ended. As such, Plaintiff was not employed by 90210
SMC at any point during the prescribed PAGA Period for this matter (e.g.,
January 30, 2023 to the present), given that her employment ended six months
prior to the start of the at-issue PAGA Period.
 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Meet and
Confer Requirement 
 
“Before
filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and
confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is
subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be
reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).)  
 
Here, counsel for Defendant submitted a declaration stating that
she spoke with Plaintiff’s counsel, and they discussed the grounds of the
demurrer on June 13, 2024 and the parties sent subsequent emails. (Horner
Decl., ¶ 3.) The Court finds the moving party has satisfied its meet and
confer obligation and the Court proceeds on the merits.
 
B.      Legal
Standard for Demurrer
 
A demurrer
tests the sufficiency of whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context—any defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the
pleading alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v.
Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the
court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual
allegations. (Id.) The only issue a demurrer is concerned with is
whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn,
supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at p. 747.)
 
C.      PAGA Claim
 
Defendant asserts that Plaintiff’s PAGA claim
fails because (1) Plaintiff is not an aggrieved employee and thus, lacks
standing, and (2) Plaintiff’s PAGA claims are rooted in non-actionable Labor
Code Statutes.
 
a.       Aggrieved
employee
 
“A PAGA claim
is legally and conceptually different from an employee's own suit for damages
and statutory penalties. An employee suing under PAGA ‘does so as the¿proxy
or agent of the state's labor law enforcement agencies.’”  (Kim v.
Reins International California, Inc.¿(2020) 9 Cal.5th 73, 81, [quoting Arias
v. Superior Court¿(2009) 46 Cal.4th 969, 986].)  “Not every private
citizen can serve as the state's representative. Only an¿aggrieved employee¿has
PAGA standing.”  (Ibid.)  “An ‘aggrieved employee’ is defined
as ‘any person who was employed by the alleged violator and against whom one or
more of the alleged violations [of the Labor Code] was committed.’”  (Id.
at p.82, [quoting Lab. Code, § 2699(c)].) 
 
The Complaint
alleges in relevant part, that Plaintiff is bringing this action on behalf of: “Plaintiff,
the State of California, and all individuals who worked for Defendants in the
State of California as hourly-paid and/or non-exempt employees at any time
during the period from December 4, 2022 to final judgment (“Aggrieved
Employees”).” (Complaint, ¶
1.) 
 
The Complaint
further alleges that Plaintiff worked for Defendants from approximately June
2017 to June 2022 as a Medical Records Auditor. (Complaint, ¶ 18.) Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant failed to properly pay her and the Aggrieved Employees
all overtime wages and minimum wages for all hours worked, failed to provide
all meal and rest breaks to which they were entitled, failed to timely pay all
wages upon termination of employment, failed to provide accurate wage
statements, failed to keep accurate employment records, failed to reimburse necessary business-related expenses, and
failed to adhere to other related protections afforded by the California Labor
Code and applicable Industrial Welfare Commission Wage Order. (Complaint, ¶
19.) 
 
The Complaint
further alleges that on December 4, 2023, Plaintiff sent a letter to Defendant requesting
copies of Plaintiff’s employment records pursuant to California Labor Code
sections 226(c), 432 and 1198.5. (Complaint, ¶ 21.) Plaintiff alleges that to
date, Defendant has not produced the requested employment records. (Complaint, ¶
23.) On January
30, 2024, Plaintiff provided notice by electronic submission to the LWDA and by
certified mail to Defendant. (Complaint, ¶ 30.) The Complaint states Defendant’s
most recent violation of California’s Labor Code occurred when it failed to
produce or otherwise make records available to Plaintiff following receipt of
his letter requesting such records. Thus, one of more of the alleged violations
were committed by Defendant against Plaintiff within the applicable statute of
limitations. (Complaint, ¶ 28.)
 
Defendant
argues that Plaintiff is not an aggrieved employee under the PAGA given that the
alleged violation, Defendant’s failure to produce her employment records,
occurred after her employment with Defendant ended. Plaintiff’s employment with
Defendant ended in June 2022. Plaintiff made her employment records request on
December 4, 2023. Plaintiff submitted her LWDA notice on January 30, 2024.
Therefore, when Plaintiff made her employment records request on December 4,
2023, she was no longer an employee. Defendant contends that in order to be an
aggrieved employee, Plaintiff must have been employed by Defendant at the time
of the alleged violation. 
 
In support of
Defendant’s argument, Defendant cites to Robinson v. S. Counties Oil Co.
(2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 476, 484-85 in its reply stating that the court found an
employee lacked PAGA standing to pursue claims based solely on violations
alleged to have occurred after his termination, even if the employee may have
been subjected to Labor Code violations during his employment, which had ended
more than a year before his LWDA letter was filed. In that case, the plaintiff
worked for the defendant from February 4, 2015, through June 14, 2017. In
August 2018, the plaintiff filed the required notice of a Labor Code violation
with the Agency. After waiting the required time, he filed suit, alleging
the defendant violated sections 226.7 and 512 by failing to
provide the required meal and rest breaks. (Robinson, at p. 480, 267
Cal.Rptr.3d 633.) However, in February 2019, in a case entitled Gutierrez
v. Southern Counties Oil Co. (Super. Ct. San Diego County, 2019, No.
37-2017-00040850-CU-OE-CTL), the San Diego Superior Court approved a settlement
in a class action that sought individual damages as well as civil penalties
under PAGA for the same alleged Labor Code violations on which the plaintiff
in Robinson brought suit. (Robinson, supra, 53
Cal.App.5th at p. 480, 267 Cal.Rptr.3d 633.) The plaintiff in Robinson and
three other employees opted out the class settlement in Gutierrez. The
plaintiff then amended the allegations in his complaint to represent employees
of the defendant who opted out of the settlement in Gutierrez and
people who were employed from January 27, 2018 to present. (Robinson, at
p. 480, 267 Cal.Rptr.3d 633.) The superior court subsequently sustained without
leave to amend a demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The court found that
the plaintiff was barred from bringing a PAGA action asserting the same claims
that were settled in Gutierrez and that he lacked standing to
bring a representative action on behalf of employees employed during the time
period when he was no longer also employed by the defendant. (Robinson,
supra, 53 Cal.App.5th at pp. 480-481, 267 Cal.Rptr.3d 633.) The court
stated, “Here, the preclusion of Robinson's claims for the period during which
he was employed by Southern Counties deprives him of standing to assert claims
arising exclusively after he was so employed.” (Robinson, supra, 53
Cal.App.5th at pp. 484, 267 Cal.Rptr.3d 633.)
 
The Court
finds Robinson persuasive here. Similar to Plaintiff in this case, the
plaintiff in Robinson brought the action on behalf of employees employed
during a time period when he was no longer employed by the defendant. The Robinson
court found the plaintiff lacked standing. Here, Plaintiff brings her action on
behalf of “all individuals who worked for Defendants in the State of California
as hourly-paid and/or non-exempt employees at any time during the period from
December 4, 2022 to final judgment (“Aggrieved Employees”).” (Complaint, ¶ 1.) During that period, Plaintiff was no longer
employed by Defendant.
 
In
Plaintiff’s opposition, the cases that Plaintiff relies on are inapposite. In Kim
v. Reins Int’l Cal., Inc. (2020) 9 Cal.5th 73, 82-83, the court addressed a
different issue and concluded an employee who settles and dismisses individual
Labor Code claims does not lose standing to pursue a PAGA claim. In Johnson
v. Maxim Healthcare Servs., Inc. (2021) 66 Cal.App.5th 924, the plaintiff
was still an active employee at the time the PAGA claim was filed. In Adolph
v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (2023) 14 Cal.5th 1104, the plaintiff alleged
violations that were committed against him while he was employed by the
defendant. Thus, the Court does not find Plaintiff’s argument or cited
authority persuasive. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, the Court does not find that Plaintiff has established standing to
pursue her PAGA claim. The Court sustains the demurrer on this ground and
declines to address the other arguments raised in Defendant’s demurrer. The
Court SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
III. DISPOSITION
 
The Court SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer with 20 days leave to
amend.
