BACKGROUND
 
On June 9,
2021, Plaintiff Heather Krantz (“Plaintiff”) filed this employment action
against Defendants Bloomberg L.P., Bloomberg BNA Holdings Inc., The Bureau of
National Affairs, Inc. d/b/a Bloomberg Industry Group (“BNA”), Michael
Bloomberg, Stephen Crossman, and Matthew Daley (collectively “Defendants”). On
January 19, 2022, Defendants Michael Bloomberg and Bloomberg L.P. were
dismissed with prejudice. 
 
On February
4, 2022, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) alleging the
following causes of action: (1) gender discrimination in violation of the FEHA
and Government Code § 12940(a); (2) retaliation in violation of the FEHA and
Government Code § 12940(h); (3) constructive discharge in violation of public
policy; (4) failure to prevent discrimination, harassment, retaliation in
violation of the FEHA and Government Code § 12940(k); and (5) gender harassment
in violation of the FEHA.
 
As alleged in the FAC, Plaintiff claims
she was treated less favorably than her male peers because of her gender during
her employment with Defendant Bloomberg Industry Group (“BNA”). (FAC, ¶ 186.)
Plaintiff was hired by BNA in January 2017 as a Large Law Account Executive.
(FAC, ¶ 74.) In May 2017, Plaintiff alleges she began witnessing a male
dominated culture within the company, including discriminatory behavior by male
colleagues towards women during work meetings. (FAC, ¶¶ 113, 133.) Plaintiff
alleges that after notifying her supervisor, Defendant Crossman, that she was
pregnant in September 2017, she was passed over for a promotion and reassigned
to a new “dockets” sales role. (FAC, ¶¶ 104-112, 117-119.)  While in training for this new role, she
allegedly had her accounts taken away which prevented her from earning
commissions and bonuses. (FAC, ¶¶ 123-124.)  When Plaintiff returned from pregnancy leave,
she alleges she was given less desirable duties assisting a Regional Sales
Director by covering open accounts and she was not given a defined territory
with her own accounts. (FAC, ¶¶ 125, 135-137.)  Further, she alleges she did not have a clear
compensation plan and was unable to earn commission. (FAC, ¶¶ 138-143.)  In addition, Plaintiff alleges her male peers
were offered higher starting salaries and commissions than her for the same
role. (FAC, ¶¶ 83-84.)

 
Plaintiff
alleges she complained to BNA supervisors of her job assignment, including her
lack of sales opportunities, lack of defined compensation plan and
discrimination concerning her pregnancy and maternity leave.  (FAC,
¶¶ 159-170.) After her repeated complaints to her supervisors, Plaintiff
alleges she was finally given her own defined territory in October 2019;
however, the accounts primarily consisted of smaller, less lucrative law firms.
(FAC, ¶¶ 172-173.) On November 1, 2019, Plaintiff alleges she was
constructively discharged. (FAC, ¶
182.)
 
On February
28, 2024, the Court granted Motion for Summary Judgment as to Defendant
Bloomberg BNA Holdings, Inc. only.
 
On June 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Compel Further Supplemental
Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set Three Request Nos. 105,
106, 107, 111, 112, 113, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 121, 122, 123, 127-132, 142,
149, 157; and request for monetary sanctions.
 
On October 1,
2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Non-Opposition.
 
On October 3,
2024, Defendants filed an Opposition.
 
No reply was
filed. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
Motions to compel further responses must always be accompanied by
a meet-and confer-declaration (per Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040) demonstrating a
“reasonable and good faith attempt an informal resolution of each issue
presented by the motion.”  (Id., §§ 2030.300(b), 2031.310(b)(2),
2033.290(b).)  They must also be accompanied by a separate statement
containing the requests and the responses, verbatim, as well as reasons why a
further response is warranted.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(a).) 
The separate statement must also be complete in itself; no extrinsic materials
may be incorporated by reference.  (Id., rule 3.1345(c).) 
 
A motion to compel further production must set forth specific
facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection
demand. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(b)(1).) It is not necessary for the
motion to show that the material sought will be admissible in evidence. “Good
cause” may be found to justify discovery where specific facts show that the
discovery is necessary for effective trial preparation or to prevent surprise
at trial. (See Associated Brewers Dist. Co. v. Superior Court (1967) 65
Cal.2d 583, 586-588; see also CCP §§ 2017.010, 2019.030(a)(1) (Information is
discoverable if it is itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and it is not
unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source
that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive.); Lipton v.
Superior Court (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1611-1612 (noting a party may
obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action, if the matter either is itself
admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence).) 
 
A motion to compel further responses to a demand for inspection or
production of documents (“RFP”) may be brought based on: (1) incomplete
statements of compliance; (2) inadequate, evasive or incomplete claims of
inability to comply; or (3) unmerited or overly generalized objections. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(c).) 
 
A motion to compel a further response to a request for production
must be noticed within 45 days of the service of the response, or any
supplemental response, or on or before any specific later date to which the
propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing. 
Otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to compel further response to
the inspection demand. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310(c); see also Sexton
v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1409; Vidal Sassoon, Inc.
v. Superior Court (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 681, 685.)  The motion must
also be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of any issue presented by it. (See
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2031.310(b)(2).) Finally, a motion to compel
further responses to inspection demands must be accompanied by a separate
document that sets forth each item to which further response is requested and
the factual and legal reasons for compelling it. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(a).)  
 
B.     
Meet and Confer
 
Plaintiff submits the declaration of her counsel stating that on May
13, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel sent a deficiency letter to defense counsel about
their failure to produce code compliant responses. (Clancy Decl., Ex. 4.) On May 14, 2024, Plaintiff’s
counsel met and conferred with defense counsel about Defendants’ failure to
produce the entirety of the requested documents. The Court finds the meet and
confer requirement has been met. 
 
C.     
Timeliness of Opposition
 
As
an initial matter, the Court notes that Defendant’s opposition was filed late.
 
A court may properly
consider papers that are not timely filed pursuant to CCP section 1005(b)
unless “substantial rights” are affected.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300(d);
Code Civ. Proc., § 475.)  The appearance of a party at the hearing of a
motion and his or her opposition to the motion on the merits is a waiver of any
procedural defects or irregularities in a motion.  (Carlton
v. Quint (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 690, 697.)
 
The hearing for this motion is set for October 10, 2024. Defendant
did not file its opposition until October 3, 2024. Plaintiff did not file a
reply to Defendant’s opposition and thus, has not addressed arguments raised in
Defendant’s opposition. The Court declines to consider Defendant’s late filed
opposition. 
 
D.    
Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further supplemental responses to Request for
Production of Documents, Set Three. 
 
On March 7,
2024, the Court ordered Defendant provide code-compliant responses without
objections (within 20 days of said Order) to Requests Nos. 105, 106, 107, 111,
112, 113, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 121, 122, 123, 127-132, 142, 149, 157.
(Clancy Decl, Ex. 2.) Plaintiff argues that Defendant has still failed to
supplement these requests with code-compliant responses. 
 
First, the
Court notes that Plaintiff’s separate statement fails to include Plaintiff’s
reason why a further supplemental response should be compelled. Thus,
Plaintiff’s separate statement is deficient.
 
Upon review
of Defendant’s further responses, the Court finds Defendant provided
code-compliant responses to Requests Nos. 105-107, 116, 117, 118, 119. Defendant’s
supplemental response states: “Defendant has conducted a diligent search and
reasonable inquiry and is not in the possession, custody, or control of any
documents that are responsive to this Request.” Plaintiff does not state why
Defendant’s response is not compliant. Thus, the Court does not find further
response is warranted. 
 
Regarding
Requests Nos. 111-115, the Court finds further response is warranted. While
Defendant provides supplemental responses and states “Defendant will produce
responsive, non-privileged documents in its possession, custody, or control,”
Defendant does not specify whether additional responsive documents are in its
possession and whether additional documents are in its possession that are also
privileged. Further, Defendant does not specify any privileges or provide a
privilege log. The Court finds Defendant’s supplemental responses are not
code-compliant. 
 
Regarding
Requests Nos. 121-123, 127-132, 142, 149 and 157, the Court also finds further
response is warranted. Defendant seeks further clarification as to the phrasing
of these Requests. The Court does not find Defendant’s responses are
code-compliant. 
 
In sum, Plaintiff’s motion to compel further supplemental
responses to the Request for Production of Documents, Set Three, Nos. 105-107, 116,
117, 118, 119 is DENIED. Plaintiff’s motion to compel further supplemental
responses to the Request for Production of Documents, Set Three, Nos. 111-115, 121-123,
127-132, 142, 149 and 157 is GRANTED.
E.     
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff seeks sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $5,250.00
for the misuse of the discovery process. 
 
As stated in Section 2023.030: (a) The court may impose a monetary
sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or
any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.
 
Here, the Court grants and denies in part Plaintiff’s Motion.
Further, Plaintiff’s Separate Statement was deficient. The Court does not
exercise its discretion to impose monetary sanctions. 
 
DISPOSITION
 
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further supplemental
responses to the Request for Production of Documents, Set Three, Nos. 105-107, 116,
117, 118, 119 is DENIED. 
Plaintiff’s motion to compel further supplemental
responses to the Request for Production of Documents, Set Three, Nos. 111-115, 121-123,
127-132, 142, 149 and 157 is GRANTED. Defendant The Bureau of Natural Affairs,
Inc. (Bloomberg) shall provide code-compliant responses within 20 days.
Plaintiff’s request for sanctions is
DENIED.
