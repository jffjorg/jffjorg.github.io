And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of the defendant's Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) in the case of Alatorre-Estevez v. General Motors, LLC. The plaintiff filed the motion on September 3, 2024, seeking to compel the deposition of the PMK to testify about the defendant's internal investigation and analysis of the powertrain system in 2020 GMC Sierra vehicles. The defendant opposed the motion, arguing that the plaintiff's discovery requests are overbroad and irrelevant.

The judge found that the plaintiff has satisfied the meet and confer requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (d)(2) and that the plaintiff has made multiple efforts to schedule the deposition of the defendant's PMK. The judge also noted that the defendant has failed to provide a valid objection to the deposition notice and has ignored the plaintiff's attempts to meet and confer.

As a result, the judge grants the plaintiff's request for an order compelling the defendant's PMK to attend and testify at deposition. The judge's ruling is tentative, and the parties have the opportunity to submit further arguments or evidence before the final ruling is made.
