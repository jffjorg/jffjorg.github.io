BACKGROUND

A.    Allegations

Plaintiff John
Doe (in pro per, “Plaintiff”) alleges that on November 15, 2021, he went to the
Bank of America branch at 5025 Lankershim Blvd. in North Hollywood.  He alleges that while he was waiting in line
at the bank, he began feeling Covid-like symptoms.  Plaintiff alleges that he informed the bank manager
of his health concerns, and the bank manager called the paramedics upon
Plaintiff’s insistence.  Plaintiff
alleges that while he was waiting for the paramedics, he wanted to finish a
transaction at the bank; however, when it was his turn, 2 paramedics from
Defendant Los Angeles Fire Department appeared and made him go outside
immediately, even though Plaintiff alleges that he needed only a moment to
finish his bank transaction.  Plaintiff
alleges that he told the paramedics about his concern about his ID and bank
card inside the bank, the paramedics informed him that his bank transaction had
been declined and that they had his cards, and they told him they would
restrain him if he resisted.  Plaintiff
alleges that he requested to be taken to USC Verdugo Hills Hospital, but they
took him to Sherman Oaks Hospital instead. 
Plaintiff alleges that the paramedics tried to give him medication, but
he refused to take any medication that he was allergic to or that he was not
given information about.  Plaintiff
alleges that paramedics/Defendants Jeffrey Blake and August Weidman each injected
him with Versed without his consent. 
Plaintiff alleges that on November 16, 2022, he awoke at Defendant
Sherman Oaks Hospital and was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis, but it had failed
to inform him that he had suffered a form of heart attack during his stay. 
The complaint,
filed November 16, 2022, alleges causes of action in the caption for: (1) negligence;
(2) violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983; (3) medical battery; (4) NIED; (5) IIED; (6)
libel; (7) negligent misrepresentation; and (8) intentional misrepresentation.  The body of the complaint does not list these
causes of action out separately.  
B.     Relevant
Background
On January 26,
2024, Defendants City of Los Angeles, erroneously and additionally named as Los
Angeles Fire Department (“City”) and August Weidmen filed a demurrer to the
complaint.   On February 27, 2024 at
12:02 a.m., Plaintiff filed the first amended complaint (“FAC”).  However, in order to be timely, Plaintiff was
required to file the FAC by February 26, 2024, which would have been the due
date for his opposition brief to the demurrer. 
Thus, the Court considered the initially filed complaint to be the operative
complaint and struck the filing of the FAC. 
On March 8, 2024, the Court ruled on City and Weidmen’s demurrer to the initial
complaint and sustained the demurer without leave to amend.  
C.     Motions
on Calendar
On
May 16, 2024, Defendant Prime Healthcare Services – Sherman Oaks, LLC dba
Sherman Oaks Hospital (“Sherman Oaks Hospital”) filed a demurrer to the
complaint.  The Court is not in receipt
of an opposition brief.  
On August 13,
2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to set aside and vacate the Court’s March 8,
2024 order dismissing City and Weidmen and sustaining their demurrers without
leave to amend.  On August 23, 2024,
Plaintiff filed an “amended and superseding” motion, as well as a notice of
errata stating that the August 13, 2024 motion did not include his
exhibits.  The Court will consider the
August 23, 2024 motion as the operative motion. 
The Court is not in receipt of an opposition brief.
DISCUSSION RE MOTION TO SET ASIDE
            The
Court will address Plaintiff’s motion to set aside first.  
            Plaintiff
makes this motion pursuant to CCP § 473(b) based on mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, and/or excusable neglect.[1]  Plaintiff also references “extrinsic mistake
(Equitable Ground Irrespective of Statute)” but this section only includes a
recitation of the law.  (Mot. at
p.9.)  Plaintiff also argues that the
doctrine of res judicata is inapplicable to void judgments, but this argument
is not applicable to the motion to set aside. 
(Mot. at pp.6-7.)
            Plaintiff
moves to set aside the order regarding City and Weidmen’s demurrer, arguing
that he was unable to appear remotely on March 5, 2024 for the March 8, 2024
hearing because the Court’s online L.A. Court Connect Portal stated that there
were no eligible events.  (See Mot. at
4:3, 4:24; Doe Decl., ¶2.)  However, the
Court did not have any hearings in this matter on March 5, 2024, such that
Plaintiff’s attempt to get onto the online system on March 5, 2024 (Tuesday) for
a future hearing date on March 8, 2024 (Friday) was not proper.  Plaintiff’s attempt to attend the March 8,
2024 hearing by signing onto the L.A. Court Connect Portal on March 5, 2024
will not be basis to grant the motion.  
            Next, Plaintiff argues that the
Court docket shows that for the March 8, 2024 hearing date, the demurrer was
taken off calendar.  (Mot., Ex. B.)  Plaintiff states that he looked at the
Court’s calendar to ensure that he did not miss the demurrer hearing and
noticed that it had been taken off-calendar at Defendant’s request, such that
he believed that there was no demurrer hearing on March 8, 2024. (Doe Decl.,
¶¶3-5.)  He provides a copy of the docket
that he printed on March 25, 2024.  The
docket under “PROCEEDINGS HELD” states: 
03/08/2024
at 08:30 AM in Department B
Hearing on Demurrer - with Motion
to Strike (CCP 430.10) - Not Held - Taken Off Calendar by Party

LOS ANGELES and AUGUST WEIDEMEN, to the complaint on 1/26/2024) - Not Held -

Los Angeles and August Weidmen on 1/26/2024) - Held - Taken under Submission

Ruling
on Submitted Matter
(Mot. at Ex. B.)  Plaintiff argues that the demurrer was taken
off-calendar upon Defendants’ request on February 21, 2024.  (Doe Decl., ¶5.)  However, according to the Court’s records, Defendants
took a demurrer (also scheduled for March 8, 2024) off-calendar on December 21,
2023, but that demurrer was under reservation number 005464350634.  The demurrer that ultimately went forward on
March 8, 2024 was under reservation number 395558073660.  Thus, this too will not be a basis to grant
the motion. 
            Plaintiff
also argues that the Court failed to make any contact with Plaintiff by phone
or email, despite the fact that he had never missed a hearing on this matter
previously.  Plaintiff argues that the
Court’s tentative ruling was to allow him to present oral arguments, but he was
denied the opportunity to do so. 
However, it is not the Court’s responsibility to contact litigants to
ensure that they attend hearings.  If the
L.A. Court Connect system was not working for Plaintiff, it was Plaintiff’s
responsibility to contact the court staff or attend the hearing in person. This
too will not be a ground to grant the motion. 

            Finally,
Plaintiff argues that he should be allowed to file the proposed FAC to moot Sherman
Oaks Hospital’s demurrer to the complaint. 
Plaintiff’s request to allow him leave to file
the proposed FAC by way to the motion to vacate the order on City and Weidmen’s
demurrer is improper.  A request for
leave to file an amended pleading should be brought in a separate motion.  Further, technically, Plaintiff had the right
to file the FAC in lieu of filing an opposition brief to Sherman Oaks
Hospital’s demurrer (i.e., by August 23, 2024). 
“A party may amend its pleading once
without leave of the court at any time … after a demurrer or motion to
strike is filed but before the demurrer or motion to strike is
heard if the amended pleading is filed and served no later than the
date for filing an opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike.”  (CCP § 472(a).)  Here, however, Plaintiff did not attempt to
file the proposed FAC after Sherman Oaks Hospital filed its demurrer on May 16,
2024.  (The first and last attempt by
Plaintiff to file the FAC was on February 27, 2024, which was untimely under
CCP § 472(a) to moot City and Weidmen’s demurrer.)  
            For
these reasons, Plaintiff’s motion to aside and vacate
the Court’s March 8, 2024 order dismissing City and Weidmen and sustaining
their demurrers without leave to amend is denied.
DISCUSSION RE DEMURRER    
            Sherman Oaks
Hospital demurs to the complaint in its entirety as to the 1st to 8th
causes of action. 
             Sherman Oaks Hospital argues that the
complaint is devoid of any facts to support the 8 causes of action listed in
the caption.  The complaint’s caption
lists 8 causes of action for: (1) negligence; (2) violation of 42 U.S.C. §
1983; (3) medical battery; (4) NIED; (5) IIED; (6) libel; (7) negligent
misrepresentation; and (8) intentional misrepresentation, but the body of the
complaint only includes General Allegations (¶¶1-27), Parties (¶¶28-36), and
Jurisdiction and Venue (¶¶37-43).  The
body of the complaint does not list the 8 causes of action out separately nor
provide facts to support each cause of action’s elements separately.  As such, the complaint fails to allege
sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action against Sherman Oaks Hospital
and fails for uncertainty.  
            The
demurrer to the complaint is sustained. 
The Court will allow Plaintiff leave to amend to allege facts against
Sherman Oaks Hospital that support each cause of action’s distinct elements. 
CONCLUSION AND
ORDER
Plaintiff’s motion to aside and vacate
the Court’s March 8, 2024 order dismissing Defendants City of Los Angeles and
August Weidmen and sustaining their demurrers without leave to amend is denied.  
Defendant Prime
Healthcare Services – Sherman Oaks, LLC dba Sherman Oaks Hospital’s demurrer to
the complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. 
The Court sets a
Case Management Conference for March 5, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. 
Each party shall
provide notice of their respective order.
