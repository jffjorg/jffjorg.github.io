[1] CCP § 474 states:
When the plaintiff
is ignorant of the name of a defendant, he must state that fact in the
complaint, or the affidavit if the action is commenced by affidavit, and such
defendant may be designated in any pleading or proceeding by any name, and when
his true name is discovered, the pleading or proceeding must be amended
accordingly; provided, that no default or default judgment shall be entered
against a defendant so designated, unless it appears that the copy of the
summons or other process, or, if there be no summons or process, the copy of
the first pleading or notice served upon such defendant bore on the face
thereof a notice stating in substance: “To the person served: You are hereby
served in the within action (or proceedings) as (or on behalf of) the person
sued under the fictitious name of (designating it).” The certificate or
affidavit of service must state the fictitious name under which such defendant
was served and the fact that notice of identity was given by endorsement upon
the document served as required by this section. …
