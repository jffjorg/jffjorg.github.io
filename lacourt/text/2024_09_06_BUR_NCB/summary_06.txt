Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied Plaintiff John Doe's motion to set aside and vacate the order dismissing City of Los Angeles and August Weidmen's demurrers without leave to amend. The court finds that Plaintiff's attempts to blame the court's online system for his failure to attend the demurrer hearing are not valid, as the demurrer was actually taken off-calendar at the request of the defendants. Additionally, the court finds that Plaintiff's failure to file an amended complaint after City and Weidmen's demurrer was filed is not a valid reason to grant the motion.

As for Sherman Oaks Hospital's demurrer, the court has sustained it, finding that the complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action against the hospital. However, the court has given Plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint to allege facts that support each cause of action's distinct elements.

The court has also set a case management conference for March 5, 2025, at 8:30 a.m., and has ordered each party to provide notice of their respective orders.
