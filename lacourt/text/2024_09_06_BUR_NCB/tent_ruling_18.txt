  Case No.:  24NNCV01213
 
  Hearing Date:  September 6, 2024
 
[TENTATIVE] order RE:
motion for leave to file cross-complaint
   



 
BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations 
            Plaintiffs Michelle Hu (“Hu”), Los
Angeles City Plaza, LP (“LACP”), and LA Valley Garden Plaza LP (“LAVGP”) (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) allege that they are the current or prior owners of the
properties located at 1598 Long Beach Boulevard, Long Beach, CA 90813 (“Long
Beach Property”), 9933 Valley Boulevard, El Monte, California 91731 (“El Monte
Property”), and 1125 S. 1st Avenue, Arcadia, California 91006
(“Arcadia Property”).  Plaintiffs allege
that the Arcadia Property is Hu’s principal residence.  
Plaintiffs allege that on November 11,
2021, Plaintiffs and Defendant The Evergreen Advantage, LLC (“Evergreen”)
entered into a secured mortgage transaction (construction loan) for
$17,500,000, which carried a 9% per annum interest rate and contained a
maturity date of December 1, 2022, secured by the 3 properties.  Plaintiffs allege that Evergreen is the
lender under the Promissory Note Secured by Deed of Trust dated November 11,
2021 (“Note”), secured by the certain Deed of Trust, Assignment of Rents,
Security Agreement and Fixture Filing dated November 11, 2021 and recorded on
November 29, 2021; and that Evergreen is the beneficiary under the DOT.  On November 8, 2022, Plaintiffs and Evergreen
entered into a Modification and Extension Agreement (“Extension Agreement”),
which had a principal balance of $11,080,000, 10.5% per annum interest rate,
required interest payments of $96,950 per month beginning January 1, 2023, and
extended the maturity date to June 1, 2023. 

Plaintiffs allege they were ultimately unable
to make the payment beginning June 2023. 
On July 3, 2023, Evergreen caused a Notice of Default (“NOD”) to be
recorded against each property, for an estimated default of
$11,359,476.46.  On March 1, 2024,
Evergreen caused a Notice of Trustee’s Sale (“NOTS”) to be recorded for the
properties, pursuant to which it sought $13,949,223.81 (estimated) through the
foreclosure of the properties.  Plaintiffs
allege that Evergreen caused the properties to be sold at foreclosure
sale.  
             The complaint, filed April 24, 2024, alleges
causes of action for: (1) violation of California Usury Law; (2) recovery of
usury interest; (3) declaratory relief; (4) violation of Civil Code, §
2924(c)-(d); and (5) unfair business practices – violation of Business &
Professions Code, § 17200 et seq. 

B.    
Motion on Calendar
On July 16, 2024, Evergreen filed a motion
for leave to file the cross-complaint. 
The Court is not in receipt of an
opposition brief. 
LEGAL
STANDARD
“A party who fails to plead a cause of action subject to the
requirements of this article, whether through oversight, inadvertence, mistake,
neglect, or other cause, may apply to the court for leave to amend his
pleading, or to file a cross-complaint, to assert such cause at any time during
the course of the action. The court, after notice to the adverse party, shall
grant, upon such terms as may be just to the parties, leave to amend the
pleading, or to file the cross-complaint, to assert such cause if the party who
failed to plead the cause acted in good faith. This subdivision shall be
liberally construed to avoid forfeiture of causes of action.”  (CCP § 426.50.)  
CCP § 428.10 states: 
A
party against whom a cause of action has been asserted in a complaint or
cross-complaint may file a cross-complaint setting forth either or both of the
following:
(a)
Any cause of action he has against any of the parties who filed the complaint
or cross-complaint against him. Nothing in this subdivision authorizes the
filing of a cross-complaint against the plaintiff in an action commenced under
Title 7 (commencing with Section 1230.010) of Part 3.
(b)
Any cause of action he has against a person alleged to be liable thereon,
whether or not such person is already a party to the action, if the cause of
action asserted in his cross-complaint (1) arises out of the same transaction,
occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences as the cause brought
against him or (2) asserts a claim, right, or interest in the property or
controversy which is the subject of the cause brought against him.
(CCP § 428.10.)  
DISCUSSION
            Evergreen moves for leave to file a cross-complaint pursuant to CCP §§
426.50 and 428.10.  A copy of the
proposed cross-complaint is attached as Exhibit 1 to the declaration of James
J. Ramos.  The proposed cross-complaint
is alleged against Hu, LACP, LAVGP, and Zhong Fang for: (1) breach of contract;
(2) fraud – intentional misrepresentation; (3) declaratory relief; (4)
violation of Civil Code, § 1950.5; and (5) breach of contract.  
            In support of the
motion, Mr. Ramos provides his declaration. 
He states that based upon his review of the complaint, he determined
that Plaintiff’s causes of action all stem from the same $17,500,000 mortgage
loan, upon which the proposed cross-complaint is based.  (Ramos Decl., ¶2.)  He states that he determined that Plaintiff’s
claims all arise out of a certain Deed of Trust encumbering the subject
property, all of which stem from the same security interest on which the
cross-complaint is based.  (Id.,
¶3.)  He states that the proposed
cross-complaint alleges a breach by Plaintiffs of the subject loan, fraudulent
misrepresentation by Plaintiffs in connection with the subject property, an
actual controversy surrounding the parties’ respective rights in the subject
loan and subject property, and seeks to recover the security deposits and
prepaid rent Plaintiffs withheld after the subject property was foreclosed
upon.  (Id., ¶4.)  He states that no trial date has been
set.  (Id., ¶5.)  Evergreen argues that the interests of justice support
granting this motion because the policy favors amendments to the pleadings and
the cross-complaint will allow the complete determination of the controversy
among the parties without duplication of time and effort.  
            Here,
Plaintiffs recently commenced this action on April 24, 2024, Evergreen has not
yet answered the complaint, and no trial date has been set, such that allowing
the filing of the cross-complaint would not prejudice the parties.  Further, Evergreen’s
motion papers and the declaration of Mr. Ramos show that the causes of action
in the proposed cross-complaint are alleged against the parties who filed the
complaint and that the cross-claims arise from the same transaction,
occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences as the complaint’s
allegations.  As such, there is merit to
granting this motion under CCP § 428.10. 
(The Court notes that Evergreen’s motion does not address CCP § 426.50’s
factors regarding whether the failure to file the cross-complaint was due to oversight, inadvertence, mistake,
neglect, or other cause.  Nevertheless,
there are other grounds to grant the motion.) 

CONCLUSION AND ORDER
            Defendant The Evergreen Advantage, LLC’s motion for leave to file the
cross-complaint is granted.  Defendant is
ordered to electronically file a separate copy of the cross-complaint following
the hearing on the matter. 
Defendant shall
provide notice of this order.
