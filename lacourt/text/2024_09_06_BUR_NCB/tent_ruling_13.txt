[1] The Court also
notes that the motion includes a reference to CCP § 473.5.  (See Mot. at p. 9.)  However, the motion does not include a
declaration showing that Defendants’ lack of actual notice in time to defend
the action was not caused by their avoidance of service or inexcusable
neglect.  Defendants have not established
how service of the summons and complaint did not result in actual notice of the
action to Defendants, other than arguments that the proof of service was
amended multiple times.  Also, the motion
is not accompanied by a copy of the proposed answer or responsive leading to be
filed in the action.  As such, relief
under section 473.5 would not be proper at this time.
