[1] The Court notes
that the “material facts” presented by Plaintiff in its separate statement are
sparse.  Plaintiff’s separate statement
refers to “Defendant” generally without specification (which the Court assumes
Defendants mean “Defendant Francisco Torres, individually and as sole
proprietor of Camarillo Discount Outlet” for the purposes of Facts 1-4).  The facts are also mere iterations of the
elements of the claim without specificity. 
For example, with respect to the breach of contract claims, Plaintiff’s
facts include: (10) and (14) “Plaintiff performance or excuse for
nonperformance”; (11) and (15) include “Defendant’s Breach”; and (12) and (16)
include “Due to Defendant’s breach, Plaintiff suffered damages as a
result.”  However, these facts lack
actual supporting facts regarding how Plaintiff performed or was excused
from nonperformance, how Defendant (general) breached (which agreement?), and
how Plaintiff suffered damages (in what amount?).  While Plaintiff cites to some evidence, the
citations are to whole exhibits without specification of pages, discovery
request numbers, etc. (e.g., Fact references Exhibits 1-2 of the Blanda
Declaration and Exhibits 1-7 to the Adams Declaration without specification).
