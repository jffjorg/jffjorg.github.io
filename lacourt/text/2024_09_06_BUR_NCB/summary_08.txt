And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further answers to form interrogatories filed by Plaintiff Michael Green. The motion was filed by Plaintiff Green on July 29, 2024, and Defendant Royal Garden Apartments Inc. filed an opposition brief on August 29, 2024. The Court notes that the voluminous amounts of discovery issues in this action have caused confusion for counsel.

The Court grants Plaintiff Green's motion to compel Defendant's further responses to FROG No. 16.1, which asks if Defendant contends that any person, other than Defendant or Plaintiff, contributed to the occurrence of the incident or the injuries/damages claimed by Plaintiff. The Court also orders Defendant to provide further responses to FROG No. 17.1, which asks if Defendant's response to each RFA served with the FROGs is an unqualified admission.

The Court denies Plaintiff Green's motion to compel further responses to FROG Nos. 15.1 and 17.1 in light of the supplemental responses that were provided by Defendant on August 30, 2024.

The Court awards Plaintiff Green monetary sanctions in the amount of $900 against Defendant, and orders Defendant to pay the sanctions within 20 days of notice of this order.
