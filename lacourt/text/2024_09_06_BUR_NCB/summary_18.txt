And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge John Kralik regarding a motion for leave to file a cross-complaint by The Evergreen Advantage, LLC (Evergreen) against Michelle Hu, Los Angeles City Plaza, LP, LA Valley Garden Plaza LP, and Zhong Fang. The motion is granted.

The background of the case is that Evergreen and the plaintiffs entered into a secured mortgage transaction for $17,500,000, which was modified and extended in 2022. The plaintiffs allege that they were unable to make payments and that Evergreen caused a notice of default and a notice of trustee's sale to be recorded. The complaint filed by the plaintiffs alleges causes of action for violation of California Usury Law, recovery of usury interest, declaratory relief, and unfair business practices.

Evergreen's proposed cross-complaint alleges causes of action for breach of contract, fraud, declaratory relief, and breach of contract against the plaintiffs and Zhong Fang. The court finds that the proposed cross-complaint arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the complaint and that the interests of justice support granting the motion.

The court notes that Evergreen's motion does not address the requirements of CCP § 426.50 regarding whether the failure to file the cross-complaint was due to oversight, inadvertence, mistake, neglect, or other cause. Nevertheless, the court grants the motion under CCP § 428.10, which allows a party to file a cross-complaint if the cause of action asserted in the cross-complaint arises out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences as the cause brought against him.
