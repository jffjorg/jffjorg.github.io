And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to set aside the default judgment and default entered against them. The defendants, Krikor Bardakjian DDS, LLC, et al., argued that they were not aware of the lawsuit and did not receive proper service of the summons and complaint. However, the judge found that the defendants had failed to show that they did not receive the documents and that their failure to review the documents after receipt was not a sufficient excuse to delay their duties in the litigation. The judge noted that the defendants' declaration stated that they were busy with their patients, but this was not a sufficient excuse to set aside the default judgment. The judge also pointed out that the defendants had not denied receiving the summons and complaint, and that they had not shown how the service was improper. Therefore, the motion was denied.
