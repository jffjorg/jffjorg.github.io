B.    
Relevant Background re: Discovery 
On August 1, 2024, the Court held an
Informal Discovery Conference (“IDC”). 
The Court ordered that each side may have 35 discovery requests and that
no additional discovery requests were permitted without further order of the
Court.  The Court continued the IDC to
August 9, 2024.  
On August 9, 2024,
the Court held another IDC in order to sequence and control discovery in this
matter: 
By
October 1, 2024, each party will serve upon all other parties a disclosure
statement as described in Code of Civil Procedure Section 2016.090(a)(1).
Except
for motions already filed and/or decided interrogatory and request for
admission discovery is stayed. 
Motions
to compel regarding document requests or depositions may be filed. As to
defendants' currently contemplated motions to compel further responses to
requests for production of documents, the time for filing those motions is
stayed by ten days from today's date to give plaintiff's the opportunity to to
[sic] provide supplemental responses.
(August
9, 2024 Minute Order.)

Court notes that following the August 9, 2024 IDC, the discovery matters on

C.    
Motion on Calendar 
On July 29, 2024, Plaintiff Michael Green
filed a motion to compel Defendant’s further responses to Form Interrogatories,
set one (“FROG”).  
On August 28, 2024, Plaintiff Michael
Green filed a notice of non-opposition, stating that he was not in receipt of
an opposition brief from Defendant.  
On August 29, 2024, Defendant filed an
untimely opposition brief.  In the
declaration in support of the opposition, counsel Daniel G. Flesch explains
that he was under the impression that the motion to compel further response to RFAs
needed to be heard before the motion to compel further responses to the FROG,
such that he believed the RFA motion was being held first such that Defendant
filed an opposition to the RFA motion on August 23, 2024 (the opposition due
date for the FROG motion).  He states
that he was confused given the voluminous amounts of discovery issues in this
action.  (Flesch Decl., ¶¶16-20.)  
On August 30, 2024, Green filed a reply
brief.  Green argues that Green already
filed a notice of non-opposition to the motion and that he will suffer
prejudice due to Defendant’s failure to timely file an opposition brief as
Plaintiffs’ counsel had to expend additional time to review over 60 pages of
documents from Defendant in 3 days so that Green’s reply brief would not be too
untimely in response.  
On September 3, 2024, Defendant filed the
supplemental declaration of Daniel G. Flesch in response to Plaintiff’s notice
of non-opposition.  
DISCUSSION 
Green moves to
compel Defendant’s further responses to FROG Nos. 15.1, 16.1, and 17.1.  
In Mr. Flesch’s
September 3, 2024 supplemental declaration, he states that Defendant served
verified supplemental responses on August 30, 2024.  The supplemental responses to FROG Nos. 15.1
and 17.1 are attached as Exhibit B to the declaration.  
FROG No. 15.1 asks Defendant to identify each denial of
a material allegation and each special or affirmative defense in the pleadings
and for each: (a) state all facts upon which it bases the denial or special or
affirmative defense; (b) state the contact information of all persons who have
knowledge of those facts; and (c) identify all documents and other tangible
things that support
its denial or special or affirmative defense, and
state the contact information of the person who has each document.  Defendant responded that the FROG was
premature, was served with the purpose of annoyance and harassment, was vague
and overbroad, sought information protected by the attorney-client and work
product privileges, sought irrelevant information, and sought an expert
opinion.  Here, the discovery is not
premature nor does it seek privileged or expert information.  The FROG seeks routine information regarding
the facts supporting the answer’s allegations. 
The objections are overruled and a further response will be compelled.  In the opposition papers, Defendant states
that it is in the process of providing supplemental responses to FROG No. 15.1
in light of the IDC.  As of August 30,
2024, it appears that supplemental responses have been provided.  However, the Court provides this discussion
in order to aid the parties in their meet and confer discussion in the event
the supplemental responses are unsatisfactory to Green.  As supplemental responses were provided, the motion
is denied as moot as to FROG No. 15.1.  
FROG No. 16.1 asks
if Defendant contends that any person, other than Defendant or Plaintiff,
contributed to the occurrence of the incident or the injuries/damages claimed
by Plaintiff and, if so, for each person: (a) state the name, address, and
telephone number (“contact information”) of the person; (b) state all facts
upon which the contention is based; (c) state the contact information of all
persons who have knowledge of the facts; and (d) identify all documents that support
the contention and state the contact information of the person who has each
document.  Defendant objected to the term
“incident” as vague and overbroad and objected that the FROG sought the
premature disclosure of expert opinion and sought attorney-client privileged
and attorney work product information.  Defendant
stated that it does not have any independent knowledge regarding the events
alleged in the complaint to permit it to provide a response to the FROG. 
In the FROG, “Incident” is
defined as the circumstances and events surrounding the alleged accident, injury,
or other occurrence or breach of contract giving rise to this action or
proceeding.  (See Mot., Ex. 1 [FROG at §
4(a)(1) (checked box)].)  The definition
as provided by the FROG form is not vague. 
The matter refers to this habitability action at the subject premises.  In addition, the objections are overruled for
the same reasons as stated in the discussion of FROG No. 15.1.  Finally, to the extent Defendant lacks
personal information, it should provide a response as follows: “If the responding
party does not have personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an
interrogatory, that party shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and
good faith effort to obtain the information by inquiry to other natural persons
or organizations, except where the information is equally available to the
propounding party.”  (CCP § 2030.220(c) [emphasis added].)  The motion is granted as to FROG No.
16.1.  
FROG No. 17.1 asks if Defendant’s response to each RFA
served with the FROGs is an unqualified admission and, if not, for each
response that is not an unqualified admission: (a) state the RFA number; (b)
state all facts upon which the response is based; (c) state the contact
information of all persons with knowledge of those facts; and (d) identify all
documents that support the response and contact information of persons who has
each document/thing.  Defendant responded
by identifying RFA Nos. 1-37, 39, 41-58, 60-67, and 72.  
With respect to the responses
to subsections (b)-(d) where Defendant responded that the wording of the
request made it not possible for Defendant to answer the question as drafted
and thus it lacks sufficient information to admit or deny, this is not an appropriate
response pursuant to CCP § 20233.220 (or in part, section 2033.220).  With other RFAs, Defendant responded that it
did not have any involvement in the management or operation of the location
where Plaintiff clamed an injury; however, Defendant should provide a response
that complies with CCP § 2030.220(c).) 
Defendant’s “responses” are essentially non-responsive as they state
that Defendant had no involvement (without any further clarification as to what
this means) or deferred its response to a later time to an expert opinion or a
trier of fact.  However, FROG No. 17.1 is
a routine interrogatory that should be responded to with the best of
Defendant’s ability and knowledge.  In
the opposition papers, Defendant states that it is in the process of providing
supplemental responses to FROG No. 15.1 in light of the IDC.  As of August 30, 2024, it appears that
supplemental responses have been provided. 
However, the Court provides this discussion in order to aid the parties
in their meet and confer discussion in the event the supplemental responses are
unsatisfactory to Green.  As supplemental
responses were provided, the motion is denied as moot as to FROG No. 17.1.  
Green seeks $1,470.50 against Defendant (=
4 hours on the motion papers, 3 anticipated hours for the reply and to attend
the hearing at $200/hour, plus $70.50 for filing fees).  In light of Defendant’s untimely filing of
the opposition brief and submission of supplemental responses that appears to
have been prompted by the filing of this motion, the Court will award sanctions
in the amount of $900 in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant.  
Defendant requests sanctions in the amount
of $2,127.50 for filing the opposition. 
Defendant’s request for sanctions is denied.  
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Plaintiff Michael Green’s motion to compel
Defendant Royal Garden Apartments, Inc.’s further
responses to FROG No. 16.1 is granted. 
The motion is denied as to Nos. 15.1 and 17.1 in light of the
supplemental responses that were provided on August 30, 2024.  Defendant is ordered to provide further responses
within 20 days of notice of this order.  
Defendant is ordered
to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $900 to Plaintiff, by and through
counsel, within 20 days of notice of this order.
Plaintiff shall provide notice of this
order.
