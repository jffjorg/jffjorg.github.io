BACKGROUND
A.   
Allegations
Plaintiffs Kristina Melara, Michelle
Lopez, Eddie Araujo, and Benny Sanchez (“Plaintiffs”) alleges that on October
11, 2021, they were involved in a motor vehicle with Defendant Alina Nazarenko (“Defendant”).

            The complaint, filed October 26,
2023, alleges a single cause of action for motor vehicle. 
B.    
Relevant Background and Motion on Calendar 
On July 18, 2024,
the Court an Order to Show Cause re: Dismissal for Lack of Prosecution.  The Court noted that Plaintiff failed to
appear, Plaintiff given proper notice of the hearing via the May 23, 2024
minute order, and that there was no proof of service filed in the action.  The Court dismissed the complaint without
prejudice.  
On July 24, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a
motion to vacate the dismissal. 
The Court is not in receipt of an
opposition brief.  
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiffs move to set aside the dismissal pursuant to
CCP § 473(b).   
            Plaintiffs provide the declaration
of counsel Seroj Meserkhani.  Mr. Meserkhani
states that the action was filed by attorney Nejdeh Bagramian and that Mr.
Bagramian had served a copy of the of the summons and complaint on Defendant on
January 12, 2024.  (Meserkhani Decl., ¶2,
Ex. 1.)  Counsel states that Mr.
Bagramian passed away unexpectedly on May 5, 2024 and thus he did not appear to
the May 23, 2024 hearing.  (Id.,
¶3.)  Mr. Meserkhani states that he does
not have personal knowledge about Mr. Bagramian’s cases, did not know of this
case or its procedural history/posture, and was not aware of the May 23, 2024
hearing or the subsequent July 18, 2024 hearing.  (Id., ¶4.)  Counsel states that he became aware of this
action recently when he was going through Mr. Bagramian’s cases and defense
counsel informed him of the dismissal entered in this action.  (Id., ¶5.)  Mr. Meserkhani states that he has now taken
over this case and has begun discussing with defense counsel issues ranging
from settlement to demurrer.  (Id.,
¶6.)  
Based on the
declaration of Mr. Meserkhani, the Court finds there is substantive merit to
the motion.  Further, the motion was
timely brought within 6 months of the dismissal and the motion is
unopposed.  Thus, the motion to vacate
the dismissal is granted.   
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER

Plaintiffs’ motion
to vacate the dismissal is granted.  
The Court sets a
Case Management Conference for March 12, 2025 at 8:30 a.m.  
Plaintiffs shall
provide notice of this order.
