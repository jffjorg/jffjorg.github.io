And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to set aside default. The motion refers to CCP ยง 473.5, but does not provide a declaration showing that the defendant's lack of actual notice was not caused by their avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. The defendant has not established how service of the summons and complaint did not result in actual notice, aside from arguing that the proof of service was amended multiple times. The motion is also missing a copy of the proposed answer or responsive pleading. As such, the judge has ruled that relief under section 473.5 would not be proper at this time.
