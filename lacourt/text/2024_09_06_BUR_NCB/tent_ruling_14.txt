  order RE:
motion for summary adjudication 
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.    Allegations

Plaintiff
Northern California Collection Service, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) alleges that within
the last 4 years, Defendant Valley View Congregate Living Inc., a California
Corporation, dba Valley View Congregate Living, Inc. (“Defendant”) became
indebted to Plaintiff’s assignor, State Compensation Insurance Fund, upon an
open book account for insurance premiums from the period of May 30, 2019 to
January 15, 2021 for Policy No. 9254966 in the sum of $28,381.96 principal, and
interest from April 20, 2021 to the entry of judgment at the rate of 10% per
annum (or $7.77 per day).  Plaintiff
alleges that no part of the sum has been paid. 
Plaintiff alleges that prior to the commencement of the action,
Plaintiff’s assignor assigned the right, title, and interest in and to the
amount for collection purposes.  
            The
complaint, filed October 17, 2023, alleges causes of action for: (1) open book
account; and (2) account stated.  
B.     Motion
on Calendar 
On
May 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for summary adjudication on its two
causes of action against Defendant: 
·        
Issue 1: Plaintiff
is entitled to judgment because it proved each element of the 1st
cause of action on an open book account; and 
·        
Issue 2: Plaintiff
is entitled to judgment because it proved each element of the 2nd
cause of action on an account stated. 
The Court is not
in receipt of an opposition brief. 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
            Plaintiff
requests judicial notice that: (1) Plaintiff’s complaint was filed on October
17, 2023 (Exhibit 12); (2) Defendant’s answer was filed on December 11, 2023
(Exhibit 13); (3) Plaintiff’s motion to deem matters admitted was filed on
March 18, 2024 (Exhibit 14); (4) Plaintiff’s motion to deem documents
genuine  was filed on March 18, 2024
(Exhibit 15); and (5) the order granting the two motion was issued on April 26,
2024 (Exhibit 16).  The request is
granted.  (Evid. Code, § 452(d).) 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff
moves for summary adjudication on the two causes of action alleged in its
complaint against Defendant and seeks judgment as a matter of law. 
            In
support of the motion, Plaintiff provides the following facts.  State Compensation Insurance Fund (“SCIF”)
provided workers’ compensation insurance to Defendant during the period May 30,
2019 to January 15, 2021.  (Fact 1,
14.)  Defendant paid SCIF an initial
deposit premium.  (Fact 2.)  During the coverage period of May 30, 2019 to
May 30, 2020, Defendant’s payments and credits totaled $34.59, and SCIF sent
Defendant a premium bill for $25,460.42; however, Defendant made no payments on
the bill.  (Fact 3-5, 15-16.)  During the coverage period of May 30, 2020 to
May 30, 2021, Defendant’s coverage renewed. 
(Fact 6.)  On December 7, 2020,
Defendant made its last payment to SCIF. 
(Fact 7.)  On January 15, 2021, at
Defendant’s request, the coverage was canceled. 
(Fact 8.)  During the coverage
period of May 30, 2020 to January 15, 2021, Defendant’s payments and credits
totaled $4,886.19, and SCIF sent Defendant a premium bill for $3,683.79;
however, Defendant made no payments on the bill.  (Fact
9-11, 17.)  SCIF assigned the 2 bills to
Plaintiff for collection, but Defendant has paid no monies to Plaintiff.  (Fact 12-13, 22-23.)  Defendant did not request reconsideration or
review regarding the classifications, ratings, the audit, or either of the
bills to SCIF’s Customer Assistance Program. 
(Fact 19.)  Defendant did not file
any complaint or request for action, or for reconsideration regarding the
ratings, classifications, the audit, or the 2 premium bills
to the Workers Compensation Insurance Rating Bureau. (Fact 20.)  Defendant did not file any appeal regarding
the ratings, classification, the audit, or either of the 2 premium bills to the
Insurance Commissioner.  (Fact 21.)  
            The
1st cause of action is for open book account.  A “book account” is “a detailed statement which constitutes the
principal record of one or more transactions between a debtor and a creditor
arising out of a contract or some fiduciary relation, and shows the debits and
credits in connection therewith ....”  (Professional Collection Consultants v. Lujan (2018) 23 Cal.App.5th 685, 690–691.)  “The creditor
must keep these records in the regular course of its business and ‘in a
reasonably permanent form,’ such as a book or card file. (Code Civ. Proc., §
337a.) ‘A book account is “open” where a balance remains due on the
account.’”  (Id. at 691.)  The elements of a cause of
action in common count includes: (1) the statement of indebtedness in a certain
sum; (2) the consideration, i.e., goods sold, work done, money loaned; and (3)
nonpayment.  (Allen v. Powell (1967) 248 Cal.App.2d 502, 510.)  
            For the open book account cause of
action, Plaintiff has shown that there is a statement of indebtedness as to a
certain sum for the coverage period of May 30, 2019 to
May 30, 2020 ($25,460.42) and for the coverage period of May 30, 2020 to
January 15, 2021 ($3,683.79).  (Mot., Ex.
5 [Premium Bill], Ex. 8 [Premium Bill].) 
As indicated above, Defendant obtained the benefit of worker’s
compensation insurance during the insurance coverage period from May 30, 2019
to January 15, 2021, until Defendant requested that its coverage be
canceled.  (Mot., Exs. 2-5, 6-7
[Insurance documents], Alexis Innis Decl., ¶22.)  Although Defendant was sent the premium
bills, Defendant did not make payments.  (Innis
Decl., ¶¶17, 25.)  Thus, Plaintiff has
established its initial burden in its motion for summary adjudication on the 1st
cause of action.  
            The 2nd cause of action
is for account stated.  “The essential
elements of an account stated are: (1) previous transactions between the
parties establishing the relationship of debtor and creditor; (2) an agreement
between the parties, express or implied, on the amount due from the debtor to
the creditor; (3) a promise by the debtor, express or implied, to pay the
amount due.”  (Zinn v. Fred R.
Bright Co. (1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 597, 600.)  
            For the account stated cause of
action, Plaintiff has shown that it was assigned the 2 bills from SCIF for
collection purposes.  (Mot., Ex. 9
[Assignment], Ex. 11 [Notice of Assignment]; Innis Decl., ¶28.)  The policy contemplated that in return for
Defendant’s payments on the premium and subject to the terms and conditions of
the policy, SCIF would provide workers’ compensation and employer’s liability
insurance.  (See Mot., Ex. 2 [Policy at
p. 1].)  Plaintiff has provided evidence
showing that although bills were sent for the policy periods, Defendant failed
to make payment.  Thus,
Plaintiff has established its initial burden in its motion for summary
adjudication on the 2nd cause of action.  
            As such, the burden shifts to
Defendant to raise a triable issue of material fact.  The motion is unopposed such that Defendant
has not raised opposing evidence or a triable issue of material fact.  Thus, the motion for summary adjudication is
granted.  
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Plaintiff
Northern California Collection Service, Inc.’s motion for summary adjudication
on the 1st and 2nd causes of action is granted.  Plaintiff is ordered to lodge with the
Court and serve on Defendant a proposed judgment within ten (10) days and to
provide notice of this order.
Plaintiff shall provide
notice of this order.
