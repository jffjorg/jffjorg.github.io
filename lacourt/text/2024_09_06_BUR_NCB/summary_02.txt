And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the action. The plaintiff had alleged that the defendants failed to pay the amounts due under a Conditional Sales Contract and had filed a complaint on May 2, 2023. The Court had dismissed the complaint without prejudice on May 2, 2023, but the plaintiff had not been aware of the dismissal until February 26, 2024. The plaintiff argued that the dismissal was invalid because the Court had continued to enter orders in the action after the dismissal had been entered. The judge found that the plaintiff had not been aware of the dismissal and that the Court had continued to accept the plaintiff's submissions and enter orders in the action. Therefore, the judge granted the motion to vacate the dismissal and set a Case Management Conference for January 2, 2025.
