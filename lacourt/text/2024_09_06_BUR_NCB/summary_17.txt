And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted Plaintiff North Mill Equipment Finance LLC's application for a writ of possession against Defendant Armen Sahakyan. The Judge finds that Plaintiff has established the probable validity of its claim to possession of the 2021 Technogen KL50FQT4 Diesel Generator, serial number 20.63985, which is the subject of the Lease Agreement between the parties. The Judge notes that Defendant failed to make a payment due and owing, and that Plaintiff has elected to accelerate the balance due under the Agreement. The Judge also finds that Defendant has no interest in the equipment, and therefore waives the requirement for Plaintiff to file an undertaking. The Judge orders that Plaintiff shall provide notice of the order, and that the writ of possession shall be issued to obtain the equipment at Defendant's address at 11936 West Magnolia Blvd., Suite 308, Los Angeles, CA 91607.
