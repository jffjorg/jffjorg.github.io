And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge notes that the facts presented by the plaintiff in its separate statement are lacking in detail. The plaintiff's statement refers to the defendant generically without specifying which defendant (Francisco Torres or Camarillo Discount Outlet) and lacks specific information about how the plaintiff performed or was excused from non-performance, how the defendant breached the contract, and how the plaintiff suffered damages. The plaintiff cites to exhibits without specifying the pages or discovery request numbers. The judge is concerned that the plaintiff's statement lacks actual supporting facts regarding these issues and is seeking more specific information before making a final decision.
