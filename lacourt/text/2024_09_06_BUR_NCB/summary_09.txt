And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment in its entirety. The Plaintiff, Forwardline Financial, LLC, alleges that the Defendants, including Francisco Torres and Frank Torres, Inc., owe it money for services rendered and loans made. The Plaintiff provided evidence to support its claims, but the Judge found that the Plaintiff failed to establish its initial burden of showing undisputed facts regarding the claims against all Defendants. Specifically, the Plaintiff did not provide evidence regarding the open book account with Camarillo Discount Outlet, a company involved in the dispute. The Judge also found that the Plaintiff failed to comply with the procedural requirements of Code of Civil Procedure § 437c. As a result, the motion for summary judgment was denied.
