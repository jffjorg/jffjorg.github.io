And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a motion to dismiss a cross-complaint filed by Defendant Gary Herman against Cross-Defendant Jonathan D. Pivo, DDS, Inc. The motion is based on the argument that the cross-complaint should be dismissed because Dr. Herman failed to timely name and serve Cross-Defendant with the cross-complaint, and that Dr. Herman lacked diligence in discovering the identity and location of Cross-Defendant. The judge has reviewed the parties' arguments and has determined that the motion should be denied. The judge notes that while Dr. Herman did wait a year to file the cross-complaint after sending a tender letter to Cross-Defendant, this delay alone is not a basis to grant the motion to dismiss. The judge also notes that the parties have a basis for indemnity and that the policy favors a resolution of the case on its merits. As a result, the judge is denying the motion to dismiss the cross-complaint.
