  Hearing Date:  September 6, 2024
 
 [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
motion for summary judgment 
 



 
BACKGROUND
A.    Allegations

Plaintiff Forwardline
Financial, LLC (“Plaintiff”) alleges that within the past 4 years of filing the
action, Defendants Francisco Torres, an individual and sole proprietor of
Camarillo Discount Center; Frank Torres, Inc.; and Francisco Torres, an
individual (collectively, “Defendants”) became indebted to Plaintiff on the
debt in the amount of $113,054.50 for a balance due on an open book account for
services rendered by Plaintiff to Defendants. 
Plaintiff alleges that the debt has not been paid and that the debt, including
interest at a rate of 10% per annum since the due date of December 21, 20223,
is now due and owing.  
Plaintiff also
alleges that on November 7, 2022, Francisco Torres, individually and as sole
proprietor of Camarillo Discount Outlet, received a loan from Plaintiff
pursuant to a Loan and Security Agreement in the amount of $45,576.09, but
Defendant failed to fulfill its obligations and breached the agreement such
that $55,127.16 is due and owing.  (Compl.,
¶¶26-30.)  Plaintiff
alleges that on November 23, 2022, Frank Torres, Inc. received a loan from
Plaintiff pursuant to a Loan and Security Agreement in the amount of $44,611.14,
but Defendant failed to fulfill its obligations and breached the agreement such
that $57,927.34 is due and owing.  (Id.,
¶¶26-30.)  Plaintiff
also alleges that on November 7, 2022, Francisco Torres executed a Personal
Guarantee whereby if Francisco Torres, individually and as sole proprietor of
Camarillo Discount Outlet, defaulted on the loan, Francisco Torres would be
personally responsible to Plaintiff and the outstanding debt amount is
$113,054.50.  (Compl., ¶¶33-39.)  
            The
complaint, filed July 12, 2023, alleges causes of action for: (1) open book
account against all Defendants; (2) account stated against all Defendants; (3)
reasonable value against all Defendants; (4) money lent against all Defendants;
(5) breach of written contract against Francisco Torres, an individual and sole
proprietor of Camarillo Discount Center; (6) breach of written contract against
Frank Torres, Inc.; and (7) breach of written guarantee against Francisco
Torres, an individual.  
B.     Motion
on Calendar 
On March 29,
2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment against Defendants.  
On August 23,
2024, Defendants filed an opposition brief.
On August 29,
2024, Plaintiff filed a reply brief. 
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff
moves for summary judgment on the complaint against Defendants.  The notice of the motion seeks only summary
judgment, though the memorandum of points and authorities includes law
regarding summary judgment and summary adjudication, and the separate statement
is separated into four “Issues.”  As the
notice of motion only includes a request for summary judgment, the Court will
treat this motion as a motion for summary judgment and not as a motion for
summary adjudication in the alternative. 
A.   
1st, 2nd, 3rd,
and 4th causes of action for common counts
The 1st cause of action is for
open book account.  A “book account” is
“a detailed statement which
constitutes the principal record of one or more transactions between a debtor
and a creditor arising out of a contract or some fiduciary relation, and shows
the debits and credits in connection therewith ....”  (Professional
Collection Consultants v. Lujan (2018)
23 Cal.App.5th 685, 690–691.)  “The creditor must keep these records in the regular
course of its business and ‘in a reasonably permanent form,’ such as a book or
card file. (Code Civ. Proc., § 337a.) ‘A book account is “open” where a balance
remains due on the account.’”  (Id.
at 691.)  The elements of a
cause of action in common count includes: (1) the statement of indebtedness in
a certain sum; (2) the consideration, i.e., goods sold, work done, money
loaned; and (3) nonpayment.  (Allen v. Powell (1967) 248 Cal.App.2d
502, 510.)  
The 2nd cause of action is for
account stated.  “The essential elements of an
account stated are: (1) previous transactions between the parties establishing
the relationship of debtor and creditor; (2) an agreement between the parties,
express or implied, on the amount due from the debtor to the creditor; (3) a
promise by the debtor, express or implied, to pay the amount due.”  (Zinn v. Fred R. Bright Co. (1969)
271 Cal.App.2d 597, 600.)  
The 3rd cause of action is for
reasonable value.  “To recover on a claim for the reasonable
value of services under a quantum meruit theory, a plaintiff must establish
both that he or she was acting pursuant to either an express or implied request
for services from the defendant and that the services rendered were intended to
and did benefit the defendant.”  (Ochs v. PacifiCare of California (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 782, 794.) 

The 4th cause of action is for
money lent.  “A claim for “money lent” is
one of the common counts.”  (Rubinstein
v. Fakheri (2020) 49 Cal.App.5th 797, 809.) 
“A common count claim broadly applies ‘wherever one person has received
money which belongs to another, and which in “equity and good conscience,” or
in other words, in justice and right, should be returned.’ [Citation.] The
claim does not require privity of contract. Although the plaintiff's right to
recover under a common count is based on equitable principles, the claim is
legal in nature. [Citation.]”  (Id.)  
Plaintiff provides the following facts in
support of the motion.  Plaintiff and Defendant
Francisco Torres, individually and as sole proprietor of Camarillo Discount
Outlet, entered into an open book account arising out of a contract.  (Fact 1.) 
Plaintiff kept an account of the debits and credits involved in the
transactions, recorded in a permanent form, which was not objected to.  (Fact 2.) 
Francisco Torres, individually and as sole proprietor of Camarillo
Discount Outlet, owes Plaintiff money on the account in the amount of
$113,054.50, plus costs and attorney’s fees. 
(Fact 3-4.)  In opposition,
Defendants dispute Facts 1-4, arguing that Plaintiff and Frank Torres, Inc. had
an open book account, it objected to the account, and it does not owe money on
the account.[1] 
For “Issue 1,” Plaintiff relies largely on
Exhibits 1 and 2 of the declaration of Jon Blanda, which include Plaintiff’s
RFA requests and Francisco Torres’ RFA responses.  Torres admitted that on November 23, 2022, he
executed a personal guaranty with Plaintiff for an underlying agreement with a
loan amount of $44,611.14.  (Blanda Exs.
1-2 [RFA Nos. 1-2].)  Torres admitted
that Frank Torres, Inc. received the loan amount, Plaintiff made a demand on
Torres to make payment on January 8, 2023, and Torres did not make payments
following January 8, 2023.  (RFA Nos. 5,
10, 11.)  Torres admits to the
authenticity of the Loan and Security Agreement entered between Frank Torres
Inc. and Plaintiff, the Account Statement with Frank Torres Inc., and the
January 8, 2023 letter Torres received from Plaintiff.   (RFA Nos. 14-16 at Exs. 1-3.) 
The exhibits attached to the RFA requests
refer to “Frank Torres, Inc.” and do not refer to “Francisco Torres,
individually and as sole proprietor of Camarillo Discount Outlet.”  As such, Plaintiff has not established its
initial burden showing that “Francisco Torres, individually and as sole
proprietor of Camarillo Discount Outlet” had an open book account with
Plaintiff.  It is Plaintiff’s burden to
follow the rules under CCP § 437c when bringing a motion for summary judgment,
including providing a separate statement that plainly and concisely provides
all material facts that it contends are undisputed followed with references to
supporting evidence.  (CCP §
437c(b)(1).)  CCP § 437c is a complicated
statute and there is little flexibility in the procedural imperatives of the
section and, as a result, section 437c is unforgiving.  (Hawkins
v. Wilton (2006) 144 Cal. App. 4th 936, 949-950.)  A failure to comply with any one of its
myriad requirements is likely to be fatal to the offending party.  (Id.)  The success or failure of the motion must be
determined by application of the required step-by-step evaluation of the moving
and opposing papers.  (Id.) 
Because of the drastic nature of the remedy sought, the moving party is
held to strict compliance with the procedural requisites.  (Id.)  Here, Plaintiff has not supported its Facts
1-4 with evidence regarding Camarillo Discount Outlet; rather, the evidence
references Frank Torres, Inc.  Thus, as
pointed out by Defendants in their opposition separate statement, there are
disputed material facts regarding Facts 1-4. 
This is a ground to deny the motion in its entirety.  (As noted above, Plaintiff only moved for
summary judgment and did not move for summary adjudication.)  
For “Issue 2,” Plaintiff also provides the
following facts: Plaintiff and Defendant Frank Torres, Inc. entered into an
open book account arising out of a contract. 
(Fact 5.)  Plaintiff kept an
account of the debits and credits involved in the transactions, recorded in a
permanent form, which was not objected to. 
(Fact 6.)  Frank Torres, Inc. owes
Plaintiff money on the account in the amount of $113,054.50, plus costs and
attorney’s fees.  (Fact 7-8.)  Facts 5-8 rely on Mr. Blanda’s Exhibits 1 and
2, similar to the above.  In contrast to
Facts 1-4, Defendant does not dispute Facts 5-8, as they refer to Frank Torres,
Inc.  However, Defendant’s lack of
dispute as to Facts 5-8 is not sufficient for the motion for summary judgment
to be granted as to the entirety of the complaint.  The 1st to 4th causes
of action are alleged against all Defendants and Plaintiff has not
established that it is entitled to summary judgment on the 1st to 4th
causes of action as to all Defendants. 
As such, the motion for summary judgment is denied in its entirety.  
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Plaintiff
Forwardline Financial, LLC’s motion for summary judgment is denied.  
Plaintiff shall provide
notice of this order.
