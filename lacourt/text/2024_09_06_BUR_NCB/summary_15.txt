And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiffs' motion to set aside the dismissal of their complaint. The complaint was filed on October 26, 2023, alleging a single cause of action for motor vehicle accident. However, the plaintiffs failed to appear at the May 23, 2024 hearing, and the court dismissed the complaint without prejudice. The plaintiffs then filed a motion to vacate the dismissal, citing CCP ยง 473(b).

The court finds that there is substantive merit to the motion, as the plaintiffs' counsel, Seroj Meserkhani, did not have knowledge of the case or its procedural history until after the dismissal. The court also notes that the motion was timely brought within 6 months of the dismissal and is unopposed.

As a result, the court grants the motion to vacate the dismissal and sets a case management conference for March 12, 2025. The plaintiffs are directed to provide notice of this order.
