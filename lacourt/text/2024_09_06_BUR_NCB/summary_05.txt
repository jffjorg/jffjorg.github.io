And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to quash a deposition subpoena issued by defendant Marc Y. Waki. The subpoena seeks to obtain business records from Dr. Cherkas, a medical doctor, and is relevant to the plaintiff's claims of emotional distress and physical symptoms resulting from emotional distress. The judge grants the motion in part and denies it in part, allowing the subpoena to proceed but limiting the scope of the documents sought to 5 years from the plaintiff's employment start date at Burbank Periodontics to the present. The judge also declines to award sanctions on the motion. The plaintiff had sought to quash the subpoena, arguing that it was overbroad and sought to obtain irrelevant information. The defendant had opposed the motion, arguing that the subpoena was necessary to obtain relevant information about the plaintiff's psychological state. The judge's ruling acknowledges that the plaintiff has placed her psychological state at issue by bringing the lawsuit and that the subpoena is necessary to obtain relevant information.
