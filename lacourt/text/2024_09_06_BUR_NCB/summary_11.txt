Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint. The plaintiff, Louis Roa, alleges that he was involved in a motor vehicle accident with Jason Ellis, who was employed by the defendant, Nothing But Class, LLC. The complaint was filed on July 24, 2023, and the court held a Case Management Conference on July 30, 2024, at which the court dismissed the complaint for lack of prosecution. The plaintiff's counsel, Costantinos Pavlakos, has provided a declaration stating that the previous attorney, Victor Ujkic, was on an extended medical leave and did not appear at the hearing, resulting in the dismissal. The court finds that there is substantive merit to the motion and grants it, vacating the dismissal. The court sets a new Case Management Conference for February 11, 2025, and requires the plaintiff to provide notice of this order.
