DISCUSSION

A.    Probable
Validity of Plaintiff’s Claims
Plaintiff filed an
application for writ of possession against Defendant.  The claimed property includes one 2021
Technogen KL50FQT4 Diesel Generator, serial number 20.63985.  (App., § 4.) 

“The standard elements of a claim for
breach of contract are: “(1) the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or
excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) damage to plaintiff
therefrom. [Citation.]”  (Wall
Street Network, Ltd. v. New York Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171,
1178.)  
In support of the application, Plaintiff
provides the declaration of Ellen W. Miller, who is the Vice President of
Plaintiff and states that she is the custodian of records.  (Miller Decl., ¶¶1-3.)  Ms. Miller states that on May 25, 2021, Defendant
entered into a written Commercial Lease Agreement (“Agreement”) with Plaintiff for
the lease of the subject equipment.  (Id.,
¶4, Ex. 1 [Lease Agreement].)  She
states, thereafter, Plaintiff performed all the terms and conditions of the
Agreement.  (Id., ¶5.)  Ms. Miller states that on March 26, 2023,
Defendant failed to make the payment due and owing, such that Plaintiff has
elected to acelrate the balance due under the Agreement.  (Id., ¶¶6-7.)  She states that the balance now due and owing
is $46,507.30, with default interest of 18% per annum from March 26, 2023, as
well as late charges of $839.90; NSF fees of $7,191.48; personal property tax,
insurance fees, residual fees, and sales tax of $2,678.78; and a termination
fee of $375.  (Id., ¶¶7-9.)  Ms. Miller states that by virtue of
Defendant’s default, Plaintiff is entitled to immediate possession of the
collateral, but that Defendant has failed to surunder possession. (Id.,
¶¶13-14, Ex. 2 [UCC-1 Financing Statement].) 
She states that in order to induce Plaintiff to furnish the equipment,
Defendant executed a Personal Guaranty on May 25, 2021, such that he too is
personally indebted to Plaintiff for the aforementioned amounts.  (Id., ¶¶16-17, Ex. 1.)  Plaintiff provides a Statement of Account,
reflecting the balance due on the Agreement. 
(Id., ¶19, Ex. 3 [Statement of Account].)  
Ms. Miller’s declaration
provides evidence to establish the probable validity of Plaintiff’s claim to
possession of the subject trailers against Defendant because it shows that
Plaintiff has the right to take immediate possession of the subject vehicle as
a result of Defendant’s default on the Agreement and Guaranty. 
B.    
Location of Vehicle 
Under CCP §
512.010(b)(4), the plaintiff must provide evidence of the location of the
property.  Further, if the property is
within a private place which may have to be entered to take possession, section
(b)(4) requires there to be a showing that there is probable cause to believe
that the property is located there. 
According  to the application documents, to Plaintiff’s
best knowledge, information, and belief, the subject equipment is located at:
(a) 11936 West Magnolia Blvd., Suite 308, Los Angeles, CA 91607, or (b) such
other location known to Defendants.  (App.
at §6.)  The West Magnolia Blvd. address
is the address provided in the Commercial Lease Agreement.  (See Compl., Ex. 1.)  
These facts are
sufficient to identify the location of the equipment at Defendant’s West
Magnolia Blvd. address.  
C.     Undertaking 
Finally,
CCP § 512.060 requires that an undertaking be filed before a writ of possession
may be issued.  CCP § 515.010(a) states
that the undertaking shall be set at an amount not less than twice the value of
the defendant's interest in the property. 
In addition, CCP § 515.010(a) defines the value of the defendant's
interest in the property as the market value of the property less the amount
due and owing on any conditional sales contract or security agreement and all
liens and encumbrances on the property, and any other factors necessary to
determine the defendant's interest in the property.  When a defendant does not have any interest
in the property, CCP § 515.010(b) permits the Court to waive the requirement of
the plaintiff's undertaking and set an undertaking for the defendant to keep
possession or regain possession.  
            If
the defendant seeks to retain possession of the property, CCP § 515.020 permits
the defendant to file an undertaking and retain the property in an amount equal
to the amount of the plaintiff’s undertaking determined in CCP § 515.010(a), or
in an amount determined by the Court pursuant to CCP § 515.010(b).  
            In
her declaration, Ms. Miller states that she is required to know the market
price for used collateral equipment and to keep in contact with equipment
re-marketers.  (Miller Decl., ¶23.)  She states that based upon her experience as
Vice President of the Re-marketing Department for Plaintiff, she is informed
and believes that the fair market value of the collateral covered by the lease
is $25,000.  (Id.)  She states that her opinion is based on the
original price, the equipment age, and the forecast of current market values, as
well as her conversations with various equipment vendors and based upon her
exerpeince in leasing equipment.  (Id.)  
According to Ms.
Miller’s declaration, the accelerated balance of the agreement due is $46,507.30.  This indicates that, for the purposes of CCP
§ 515.010, Defendant has no interest in the equipment.  Accordingly, the Court waives the requirement
for Plaintiff to file an undertaking because Defendant has no interest in the equipment.

            As
the application is not opposed and Defendant is in default, it does not appear
that Defendant seeks to retain possession of the equipment.

LLC, a limited liability company and servicing agent for North Mill Credit
