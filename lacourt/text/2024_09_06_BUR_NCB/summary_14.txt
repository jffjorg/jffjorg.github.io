And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication on the two causes of action: open book account and account stated. The plaintiff, Northern California Collection Service, Inc., alleged that the defendant, Valley View Congregate Living Inc., became indebted to the plaintiff's assignor, State Compensation Insurance Fund, for insurance premiums from May 30, 2019 to January 15, 2021. The plaintiff provided evidence showing that the defendant failed to pay the premium bills, despite receiving the bills and having the benefit of workers' compensation insurance during the relevant period. The judge found that the plaintiff has established its initial burden in its motion for summary adjudication on both causes of action, and since the defendant did not raise opposing evidence or a triable issue of material fact, the motion for summary adjudication is granted. The plaintiff is ordered to lodge a proposed judgment with the court and serve it on the defendant within 10 days.
