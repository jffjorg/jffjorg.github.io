And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice. The plaintiff is seeking $66,962.66 in damages, including $50,500.00 in damages, $15,917.50 in interest, $0.00 in attorney fees, and $545.16 in costs. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff's damage calculations are incorrect, and the bulk of the allegations in the complaint focus on the defendant's failures to perform under the August 4, 2020 agreement, not the June 23, 2020 agreement. Additionally, the plaintiff has not provided a certain date for calculating prejudgment interest, which is required by law. Finally, the defendant did not dismiss any of the doe defendants or submit an application for separate judgment. Therefore, the judge has denied the plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment without prejudice, and the case will proceed to a hearing on February 1, 2024.
