  Case Number:  22PSCV00248    Hearing Date:   February 1, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff
Cindy Lo’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendant: Treeium Inc. 
TENTATIVE RULING
            Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.           
BACKGROUND
            This
is a breach of contract and fraud action. On March 16, 2022, plaintiff Cindy Lo
(Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Treeium Inc. (Defendant) and
Does 1 through 100, alleging causes of action for fraud, breach of contract,
breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and negligent
hiring, supervision and retention. On December 18, 2023, the Court struck
Defendant’s answer to the complaint and entered default against Defendant for
failure to retain counsel. On January 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a request for
entry of default judgment.           
LEGAL
STANDARD
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a
proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment
is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil Procedure
section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7) exhibits
as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by
the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff seeks
default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $66,962.66,
including $50,500.00 in damages, $15,917.50 in interest, $0.00 in attorney
fees, and $545.16 in costs. The Court finds there are a few problems with Plaintiff’s
request for entry of default judgment. First, Plaintiff’s damage calculations do
not add up. Plaintiff seeks to recover $4,000.00 from the first services
agreement with Defendant, which is dated June 23, 2020. (Lo Decl., Ex. A.) That
agreement covered Defendant providing a floor plan and submitting it for
approval. (Lo Decl., ¶ 3.) Plaintiff states in her declaration that Defendant
did just that. (Lo Decl., ¶ 7.) 
Additionally,
the bulk of the allegations of the complaint focus on Defendant’s failures to
perform under the August 4, 2020 agreement, not the June 23, 2020 agreement.
(See Compl., ¶¶ 5-14.) As such, Defendant did not breach the June 23, 2020
agreement, and the $4,000.00 paid thereunder is not recoverable. “To prevail on a cause of action for
breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove (1) the contract, (2) the
plaintiff's performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, (3) the
defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the plaintiff.
[Citation].” (See Richman v. Hartley
(2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186, emphasis added.) 
As for the
August 4, 2020 agreement, the Court finds that the evidence at most supports $46,050.00
in payments made to Defendant. (Lo Decl., Exs. E-L.) 
Second, Plaintiff must provide a certain date for
calculating prejudgment interest, which would be the date there was both a
breach and a liquidated claim. (Civ. Code § 3287, subd. (a).; Maurice L. Bein, Inc. v. Housing Authority of
City of Los Angeles (1958) 157
Cal.App.2d 670, 762-763; County of Solano v. Lionsgate Corp. (2005) 126
Cal.App.4th 741, 753; see also F. Prejudgment Interest, Cal. Prac. Guide
Civ. Trials & Ev. Ch. 17-F, ¶ 17:1093 [“Interest commences on the first day
there exists both a breach and a
liquidated claim. [Citations].”]) Plaintiff’s
interest calculation appears to be based on the dates Plaintiff made payments
rather than the date Defendant breached the August 4, 2020 agreement. (See Lo
Decl. re Interest.) 
Third, Defendant did not dismiss any of
the doe Defendants or alternatively submit an application for a several and
separate judgment. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(7); Code Civ.
Proc., § 579.)

CONCLUSION
            Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request
for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
