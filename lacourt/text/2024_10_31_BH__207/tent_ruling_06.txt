MOTION
 
This case arises from a dispute over a commercial lease.  On August 18, 2022, the Court granted summary
judgment in favor of Defendants Pellequr LLC; Anna Margaryan; Dennis Colonello;
and Steven Yoon Shin (“Defendants”). 
Judgment was entered on September 19, 2022.  Plaintiff Elite Financial Realty, LLC (“Plaintiff”)
timely appealed on October 3, 2022.  The
appellate court affirmed the judgment and the remittitur issued on October 10,
2024.  
 
Defendants now move to recover their attorneys’ fees and costs
incurred after judgment was entered in the amount of $82,001.15.  The motion is unopposed.[1]
 
ANALYSIS
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 1033.5, which outlines recoverable costs to a prevailing party under Code
of Civil Procedure section 1032, permits the recovery of attorneys’ fees when
authorized by contract, statute, or law. 
(Code Civ. Proc.. § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).)  Code of Civil Procedure section 1021 provides:
 “[e]xcept as attorney’s fees are
specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of
attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied,
of the parties [….]”  
 
Similarly, Civil Code section
1717 provides:  “[i]n any action on a
contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and
costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to
one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined
to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party
specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s
fees in addition to other costs.”  (Civ.
Code, § 1717, subd. (a).)  The
Code of Civil Procedure defines the “prevailing party” as follows: 
 
[T]he party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a
dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains
any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any
relief against that defendant. If any party recovers other than monetary relief
and in situations other than as specified, the “prevailing party” shall be as
determined by the court, and under those circumstances, the court, in its
discretion, may allow costs or not and, if allowed, may apportion costs between
the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under
Section 1034.
 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (a)(4).)  Because
Summary Judgment was entered in Defendants’ favor, and Plaintiff recovered
nothing by the lawsuit, Defendants are “prevailing parties” in this action.
 
Although Defendants did not attach a copy of the lease agreement to
this motion, the Court notes that in connection with its August 18, 2022
summary judgment ruling, the Court found:
 
Section 31 of the lease states, in pertinent part “If any Party or
Broker brings an action or proceeding involving the Premises whether founded in
tort, contract or equity or to declare rights hereunder, the Prevailing Party
(as hereafter defined) in any such proceeding, action, or appeal thereon, shall
be entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees… The term ‘Prevailing Party’ shall
include, without limitation, a Party or Broker who substantially obtains or
defeats the relief sought, as the case may be, whether by compromise,
settlement, judgment, or the abandonment by the other Party or Broker of its
claim or defense.” (Ex. 2 to Margaryan Decl.) The guaranty executed by
Defendants Anna Margaryan, Dennis Colonello, and Steven Yoon Shin similarly
provides “In the event any action be brought by said Lessor against Guarantors
hereunder to enforce the obligation of Guarantors hereunder, the unsuccessful
party in such action shall pay to the prevailing party therein a reasonable
attorney’s fee.” (Id.)
 
(Minute
Order, Aug. 18, 2022 at p. 9.)  Therefore,
Defendants are generally entitled to their reasonable attorneys’ fees.
 
            In support of the motion, Defendants
have provided records for attorneys’ fees incurred at a rate of $400/hour, set
forth as follows:
 
·      
First year – 9/30/22 - 9/29/23 – 108 hours -
$43,200
·      
Second year – 9/30/24 – 9/1/19 (sic) – 131 hours
- $52,400
 
(Ex.
A to Tumpson Decl.)
 
            The Court notes that the $43,200 +
$52,400 = $95,600 attorneys’ fees incurred exceed the $81,776.83[2] in
attorneys’ fees requested, and Plaintiff has not opposed the motion to
challenge the reasonableness of the attorneys’ fees.
 
Conclusion
 
Therefore, the Court grants Defendants’
unopposed motion for attorneys’ fees only in the amount of $81,776.83.  
 
Further, Defendants shall file and serve a
proposed Order in conformance with the Court’s ruling on or before November 15,
2024.  
 
Further, Defendants shall provide notice
of the Court’s ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
