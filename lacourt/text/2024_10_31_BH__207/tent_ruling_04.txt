MOTION
 
On July 16, 2024, Plaintiff Nick Nasser Pourmand (“Plaintiff”) filed
the Complaint alleging two causes of action for (1) fraud by false promise; and
(2) violations of California’s Fair Debt Collection Practices Act against
Defendant Verizon Wireless Service, LLC (“Defendant”) stemming from Defendant’s
alleged false promise to provide Plaintiff free internet service with
Plaintiff’s purchase of a telephone service subscription and alleged attempt to
collect on false collection bills.
 
Defendant now moves to compel arbitration and stay the instant
proceedings based on the arbitration provision in the Verizon Wireless Customer
Agreement.  Defendant’s motion is
unopposed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.    
MOTION TO COMPEL ARBITRATION – LEGAL STANDARDS
 
            “[T]he advantages of arbitration
include a presumptively less costly, more expeditious manner of resolving
disputes.  It follows a party to a valid
arbitration agreement has a contractual right to have its dispute with another
party to the contract resolved quickly and inexpensively.”  (Henry v. Alcove Investment, Inc.
(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 94, 99–100 [cleaned up].) 
Thus, “on petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the
existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party to
the agreement refuses to arbitrate that controversy, the court shall order the
petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines
that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2; see also 
EFund
Capital Partners v. Pless (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1311, 1320 [the language
in section 1281.2 compelling arbitration is mandatory].) The right to compel
arbitration exists unless the court finds that the right has been waived by a
party’s conduct, other grounds exist for revocation of the agreement, or where
a pending court action arising out of the same transaction creates the possibility
of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2, subds.
(a)-(c).)    
 
            “On a petition to compel
arbitration, the trial court must first determine whether an agreement to
arbitrate the controversy exists. 
Because the existence of the agreement is a statutory prerequisite to
granting the petition, the petitioner bears the burden of proving its existence
by a preponderance of the evidence.  The
party seeking arbitration can meet its initial burden by attaching to the
petition a copy of the arbitration agreement purporting to bear the
respondent's signature.”  (Bannister
v. Marinidence Opco, LLC (2021) 64 Cal.App.5th 541, 543-544 [cleaned
up].)  The party seeking to compel arbitration must also “plead and prove a
prior demand for arbitration and a refusal to arbitrate under the
agreement.”  (Mansouri v. Superior
Court (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 633, 640-641.) 

 
            And while the moving party on a
motion to compel arbitration “bears the burden of proving the existence of a
valid arbitration agreement by a preponderance of the evidence, [a] party
opposing the petition bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the
evidence any fact necessary to its defense.  The trial court sits as the
trier of fact, weighing all the affidavits, declarations, and other documentary
evidence, and any oral testimony the court may receive at its discretion, to
reach a final determination.”  (Ruiz
v. Moss Bros. Auto Group, Inc. (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 836, 842 [cleaned
up]; see also Pinnacle Museum Tower Assn. v. Pinnacle Market Development (US), LLC (2012) 55 Cal.4th 223, 236 [“The party
seeking arbitration bears the burden of proving the existence of an arbitration
agreement, and the party opposing arbitration bears the burden of proving any
defense, such as unconscionability”].)

(Ex.
1 to Ninete Decl.)   The Customer
Agreement attached as Exhibit 2 provides:
 
HOW DO I
RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH VERIZON? 
WE HOPE TO MAKE YOU A HAPPY CUSTOMER, BUT IF
THERE’S AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED, THIS SECTION OUTLINES WHAT’S
EXPECTED OF BOTH OF US. 
 
YOU AND VERIZON BOTH AGREE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES
ONLY BY ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS DISCUSSED BELOW. YOU UNDERSTAND
THAT BY THIS AGREEMENT YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM IN COURT OR
IN FRONT OF A JURY. WHILE THE PROCEDURES IN ARBITRATION MAY BE DIFFERENT, AN
ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD YOU THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF, AND MUST HONOR THE SAME
TERMS IN THIS AGREEMENT, AS A COURT WOULD, SUBJECT TO THE LIMITS ON ARBITRATOR
AUTHORITY SET FORTH BELOW. IF THE LAW ALLOWS FOR AN AWARD OF ATTORNEYS’ FEES,
AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THEM TOO. THE SAME DEFENSES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE TO BOTH
PARTIES AS WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN COURT INCLUDING ANY APPLICABLE STATUTE OF
LIMITATIONS. WE ALSO BOTH AGREE THAT: 
 
(1) THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT APPLIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT. EXCEPT FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT CASES OR AS SPECIFICALLY NOTED BELOW,
ANY DISPUTE THAT IN ANY WAY RELATES TO OR ARISES OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, WILL BE
RESOLVED BY ONE OR MORE NEUTRAL ARBITRATORS BEFORE THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION
ASSOCIATION (“AAA”) AS EXPLAINED BELOW IN PARAGRAPH 2. THIS INCLUDES, BUT IS
NOT LIMITED TO, ANY DISPUTE REGARDING THE VALIDITY, ENFORCEABILITY, OR SCOPE OF
ANY PORTION OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE), ANY
EQUIPMENT, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES YOU RECEIVE FROM US, ANY ADVERTISING FOR ANY
SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OUR EFFORTS TO COLLECT AMOUNTS YOU MAY OWE US FOR
SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURY OR INVASION OF PRIVACY
RELATING TO SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES AND INCLUDES ANY DISPUTES YOU HAVE WITH
OUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS. YOU CAN ALSO BRING ANY ISSUES YOU MAY HAVE TO THE
ATTENTION OF FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AND IF THE LAW
ALLOWS, THEY CAN SEEK RELIEF AGAINST US FOR YOU. THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE
CONTINUES TO APPLY EVEN AFTER YOU HAVE STOPPED RECEIVING SERVICE FROM US. 
 
(2) UNLESS YOU AND VERIZON AGREE OTHERWISE, THE
ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE COUNTY OF YOUR BILLING ADDRESS. AND THE
AAA’S CONSUMER ARBITRATION RULES WILL APPLY. IF THE AAA REFUSES TO ENFORCE ANY
PART OF THE ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU AND VERIZON WILL SELECT ANOTHER
ARBITRATOR. IF THERE IS NO AGREEMENT, A COURT IN THE COUNTY OF YOUR BILLING
ADDRESS WILL SELECT AN ARBITRATOR TO DECIDE THE DISPUTE. UNLESS OTHERWISE
PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATOR APPOINTED TO DETERMINE THE
MERITS OF THE DISPUTE SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY TO ARBITRATE, INCLUDING
BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY DISPUTE REGARDING THE VALIDITY, ENFORCEABILITY OR SCOPE
OF ANY PORTION OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE). YOU
CAN GET PROCEDURES, RULES AND FEE INFORMATION FROM THE AAA (WWW.ADR.ORG) OR
FROM US. FOR CLAIMS OF $25,000 OR LESS, YOU CAN CHOOSE WHETHER YOU’D LIKE THE
ARBITRATION CARRIED OUT BASED ONLY ON DOCUMENTS SUBMITTED TO THE ARBITRATOR, OR
BY A HEARING IN PERSON OR BY PHONE. ALTERNATIVELY, FOR CLAIMS WITHIN THE
JURISDICTIONAL LIMIT OF THE SMALL CLAIMS COURT IN THE STATE ENCOMPASSING YOUR
BILLING ADDRESS, EITHER YOU OR VERIZON CAN CHOOSE TO BRING AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION
IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT INSTEAD OF PROCEEDING IN ARBITRATION; FURTHERMORE, IF THE
CLAIMS IN ANY REQUEST OR DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION COULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN
SMALL CLAIMS COURT, THEN EITHER YOU OR VERIZON MAY CHOOSE TO HAVE THE CLAIMS
HEARD IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, AT ANY TIME BEFORE THE
ARBITRATOR IS APPOINTED, BY NOTIFYING THE OTHER PARTY OF THAT CHOICE IN
WRITING. IF THIS PROVISION OR THE LIMITATION ON BRINGING ACTIONS TO SMALL
CLAIMS COURT IS FOUND TO BE INVALID, THEN THIS PROVISION SHALL BE SEVERABLE AND
THE MATTER WILL PROCEED IN ARBITRATION; IN NO WAY WILL THIS PROVISION ALLOW FOR
AN ACTION TO BE BROUGHT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS. 
 
(3) THIS AGREEMENT DOESN’T ALLOW CLASS OR
COLLECTIVE ARBITRATIONS EVEN IF THE AAA PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD
MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF
AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY’S
INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. NO CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR
GENERAL INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THEORIES OF LIABILITY OR PRAYERS FOR RELIEF MAY BE
MAINTAINED IN ANY ARBITRATION HELD UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. ANY QUESTION REGARDING
THE ENFORCEABILITY UNDER APPLICABLE LAW OR INTERPRETATION OF THIS PARAGRAPH
SHALL BE DECIDED BY A COURT AND NOT THE ARBITRATOR. 
 
(4) IF EITHER OF US INTENDS TO SEEK ARBITRATION
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTY SEEKING ARBITRATION MUST FIRST NOTIFY THE OTHER
PARTY OF THE DISPUTE IN WRITING AT LEAST 60 DAYS IN ADVANCE OF INITIATING THE
ARBITRATION. NOTICE TO VERIZON SHOULD BE SENT TO VERIZON WIRELESS DISPUTE
RESOLUTION MANAGER, USING THE FORM AVAILABLE HERE:
HTTPS://WWW.VERIZON.COM/ABOUT/NOD/NOTICEOF-DISPUTE-WIRELESS-FORM. THE NOTICE
MUST INCLUDE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY YOUR ACCOUNT AS WELL AS
TO ASSESS AND ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE YOUR CLAIM, INCLUDING THE NAME OF THE VERIZON
WIRELESS ACCOUNT HOLDER, THE MOBILE TELEPHONE NUMBER AT ISSUE, A DESCRIPTION OF
THE CLAIM, THE SPECIFIC FACTS SUPPORTING THE CLAIM, THE DAMAGES YOU CLAIM TO
HAVE SUFFERED AND THE RELIEF YOU ARE SEEKING. THE NOTICE REQUIREMENT IS
DESIGNED TO ALLOW VERIZON TO MAKE A FAIR, FACT-BASED OFFER OF SETTLEMENT IF IT
CHOOSES TO DO SO. YOU CANNOT PROCEED TO ARBITRATION UNLESS YOU PROVIDE THIS
INFORMATION. YOU MAY CHOOSE TO BE REPRESENTED BY AN ATTORNEY OR OTHER PERSON AS
PART OF THIS PROCESS, BUT IF YOU DO YOU MUST INDICATE THAT YOU ARE REPRESENTED
BY AN ATTORNEY ON THE FORM AVAILABLE AT HTTPS://WWW.
VERIZON.COM/ABOUT/NOD/NOTICE-OF-DISPUTE-WIRELESS-FORM AND CONFIRM YOU AUTHORIZE
US TO DISCUSS YOUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION WITH THIS ATTORNEY OR OTHER PERSON. THE
SUFFICIENCY OF THIS NOTICE OF DISPUTE IS AN ISSUE TO BE DECIDED BY A COURT
PRIOR TO THE FILING OF ANY DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION AND THE AAA MUST NOT ACCEPT,
ADMINISTER, ASSESS, OR DEMAND FEES IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DEMAND THAT HAS NOT
SATISFIED THIS NOTICE OF DISPUTE REQUIREMENT. IF YOU HAVE PROVIDED THIS
INFORMATION AND WE ARE UNABLE TO RESOLVE OUR DISPUTE WITHIN 60 DAYS, EITHER
PARTY MAY THEN PROCEED TO FILE A CLAIM FOR ARBITRATION. WE’LL REIMBURSE ANY
FILING FEE THAT THE AAA CHARGES YOU FOR ARBITRATION OF THE DISPUTE AT THE
CONCLUSION OF THE ARBITRATION IF YOU FULLY PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCEEDING. WE’LL
ALSO PAY ANY ADMINISTRATIVE AND ARBITRATOR FEES CHARGED BY THE ARBITRATION
TRIBUNAL. IF THE ARBITRATOR DETERMINES THAT YOUR CLAIM WAS FILED FOR PURPOSES
OF HARASSMENT OR IS PATENTLY FRIVOLOUS, THE ARBITRATOR WILL REQUIRE YOU TO
REIMBURSE VERIZON FOR ANY FILING, ADMINISTRATIVE OR ARBITRATOR FEES ASSOCIATED
WITH THE ARBITRATION. THE ARBITRATOR ASSIGNED TO ANY ARBITRATION BETWEEN
VERIZON AND A CUSTOMER SHALL RESOLVE THE CLAIMS WITHIN 120 DAYS OF APPOINTMENT
OR AS SWIFTLY AS POSSIBLE THEREAFTER, CONSISTENT WITH FAIRNESS TO THE PARTIES.
 
(5) WE MAY, BUT ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO, MAKE A
WRITTEN SETTLEMENT OFFER ANYTIME BEFORE THE ARBITRATION HEARING. THE AMOUNT OR
TERMS OF ANY SETTLEMENT OFFER MAY NOT BE DISCLOSED TO THE ARBITRATOR UNTIL
AFTER THE ARBITRATOR ISSUES AN AWARD ON THE CLAIM. IF YOU DON’T ACCEPT THE
OFFER AND THE ARBITRATOR AWARDS YOU AN AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT’S MORE THAN OUR
OFFER BUT LESS THAN $5,000, OR IF WE DON’T MAKE YOU AN OFFER, AND THE
ARBITRATOR AWARDS YOU ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY BUT LESS THAN $5,000, THEN WE AGREE
TO PAY YOU $5,000 INSTEAD OF THE AMOUNT AWARDED. IN THAT CASE WE ALSO AGREE TO
PAY ANY REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND EXPENSES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LAW
REQUIRES IT FOR YOUR CASE. IF THE ARBITRATOR AWARDS YOU MORE THAN $5,000, THEN
WE WILL PAY YOU ONLY THAT AMOUNT.
 
(6) IF 50 OR MORE CUSTOMERS INITIATE NOTICES OF
DISPUTE PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH 4 ABOVE, OTHERWISE ATTEMPT TO COMMENCE AN
ARBITRATION, OR FILE A COMPLAINT IN COURT, WHICH RAISE SIMILAR CLAIMS, AND
COUNSEL FOR THE VERIZON WIRELESS CUSTOMERS BRINGING THE CLAIMS ARE THE SAME OR
COORDINATED FOR THESE CUSTOMERS, THE CLAIMS SHALL PROCEED IN ARBITRATION IN A
COORDINATED PROCEEDING. IN THE FIRST STAGE, 50 ARBITRATIONS WILL PROCEED AND
COUNSEL FOR THE VERIZON WIRELESS CUSTOMERS AND COUNSEL FOR VERIZON WIRELESS SHALL
EACH SELECT 25 CASES TO PROCEED FIRST IN ARBITRATION IN INDIVIDUAL BELLWETHER
PROCEEDINGS BEFORE SEPARATE ARBITRATORS. AFTER THE FIRST STAGE IS COMPLETED,
THE PARTIES MUST ENGAGE IN A MEDIATION OF ALL REMAINING CASES, AND VERIZON WILL
PAY THE MEDIATION FEE. IF THE PARTIES CANNOT AGREE HOW TO RESOLVE THE REMAINING
CASES AFTER MEDIATION, THEY WILL REPEAT THE PROCESS OF SELECTING AND FILING
CASES TO BE RESOLVED IN INDIVIDUAL BELLWETHER PROCEEDINGS BEFORE SEPARATE
ARBITRATORS, FOLLOWED BY MEDIATION. IN THE SECOND STAGE, 80 ARBITRATIONS WILL
PROCEED AND COUNSEL FOR THE VERIZON CUSTOMERS AND COUNSEL FOR VERIZON SHALL
EACH SELECT 40 CASES TO PROCEED IN ARBITRATION IN INDIVIDUAL BELLWETHER
PROCEEDINGS BEFORE SEPARATE ARBITRATORS. AFTER THE SECOND STAGE IS COMPLETED,
THE PARTIES MUST ENGAGE IN A MEDIATION OF ALL REMAINING CASES, AND VERIZON WILL
PAY THE MEDIATION FEE. AFTER THE SECOND SET OF ARBITRATIONS AND MEDIATION
CONCLUDE, IF THE PARTIES CANNOT AGREE HOW TO RESOLVE THE REMAINING CLAIMS, ANY
INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER WHO IS PART OF THIS COORDINATED PROCEEDING, OR VERIZON, MAY
ELECT TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION BY PROVIDING NOTICE TO OPPOSING COUNSEL, AND IF
THE CUSTOMER WISHES TO PROCEED WITH THE CLAIM THEY MAY FILE AN INDIVIDUAL
COMPLAINT IN COURT. FOR THOSE CUSTOMERS WHO DO NOT OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION,
THEIR CLAIMS WILL PROCEED IN ARBITRATION IN CONTINUED BATCHES OF 80 CLAIMS AS
SET FORTH ABOVE FOR THE SECOND SET. ADDITIONAL CASES INVOLVING SIMILAR CLAIMS
BROUGHT BY THE SAME OR COORDINATED COUNSEL SHALL NOT BE FILED IN ARBITRATION
UNTIL THE ARBITRATIONS AND MEDIATION FOR PRIOR SETS HAS BEEN COMPLETED. YOU
AGREE TO THIS PROCESS EVEN THOUGH IT MAY DELAY THE ARBITRATION OF YOUR CLAIM.
IF SUCH A PROCESS IS INITIATED, THE FILING OF A NOTICE OF DISPUTE BY A CUSTOMER
IN ACCORDANCE WITH PARAGRAPH 4 OR FILING OF A COMPLAINT IN COURT WILL TOLL ALL
APPLICABLE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS FOR THAT CUSTOMER’S DISPUTE UNTIL THE
COMPLETION OF THE PROCESS DESCRIBED IN THIS PARAGRAPH. A COURT WILL HAVE
AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THIS PARAGRAPH INCLUDING BY ENTERING AN INJUNCTION TO
PROHIBIT FILINGS IN VIOLATION OF THIS PARAGRAPH.
 
(7) AN ARBITRATION AWARD AND ANY JUDGMENT
CONFIRMING IT APPLY ONLY TO THAT SPECIFIC CASE; IT CAN’T BE USED IN ANY OTHER
CASE EXCEPT TO ENFORCE THE AWARD ITSELF.
 
(8) IF A COURT, PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH 3,
DETERMINES THAT THE PROHIBITION ON CLASS ARBITRATIONS OR THE LIMITS ON THE
ARBITRATOR’S AUTHORITY CANNOT BE ENFORCED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW AS TO ALL OR
PART OF A DISPUTE, THEN THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE WILL NOT APPLY TO THAT
DISPUTE OR PART OF THE DISPUTE, WHICH MAY PROCEED IN COURT EITHER ONCE THE
ARBITRATED MATTERS HAVE CONCLUDED OR SOONER IF THE COURT SO REQUIRES. 
 
(9) IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN
COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, INCLUDING IF A CUSTOMER OR VERIZON OPT
OUT OF ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH (6) ABOVE, YOU AND VERIZON AGREE THAT,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW,NO ACTION WILL BE BROUGHT ON A
CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS AND YOU AND VERIZON UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY WAY. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH
MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.
 
(Ex.
2 to Ninete Decl. [emphases original.])
 
            Therefore, Defendant has
demonstrated that an agreement to arbitrate exists between the parties that
covers the instant dispute, and Plaintiff has not opposed the motion.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            For the foregoing reasons, the Court
grants Defendant’s unopposed motion to compel arbitration and stays the civil action
pending the completion of the Arbitration. 

 
            Further, on the Court’s own motion,
the Court vacates the Case Management Conference set on November 20, 2024, and
sets a Status Conference re Arbitration on July 22, 2025 at 8:30 A.M. in
Department 207.  The parties shall file a
Joint Report regarding the status of the Arbitration no later than 5 court days
before the scheduled Status Conference.  
 
            Defendant shall provide notice of
the Court’s orders and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
