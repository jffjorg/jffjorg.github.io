```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the third and fourth causes of action alleged by the defendant, which are based on negligent and intentional misrepresentation, respectively. The judge found that the allegations in the cross-complaint do not state a cause of action for misrepresentation because they are based on speculative opinions about future events that did not occur as planned. The judge also found that the allegations do not demonstrate that the promises were knowingly false when made, and that the defendant's conduct was not outrageous or intended to inflict emotional distress. The judge has ordered the parties to file a reply to the demurrer and has set a hearing on the tentative ruling.
