MOTION
 
On July 26, 2021, Plaintiff 1427
Lincoln Santa Monica LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed suit against Defendant Nicholas
Morris (“Defendant”) to recover for breach of a lease and damages to
Plaintiff’s real property.  
 
On March 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a Notice of Settlement, and the Court set an Order to Show Cause Re: Settlement
(“OSC”) for September 13, 2024. 
Plaintiff did not submit any documents or appear at the OSC.  Consequently, the Court dismissed the case
without prejudice.
 
Plaintiff now moves to set aside
the dismissal and have judgment entered against Defendant for breaching the
settlement agreement.  The motion is
unopposed.
 
LEGAL
STANDARDS
 
                         
I.         
SET ASIDE DISMISSAL
 
a.     DISCRETIONARY
AND MANDATORY RELIEF
 
Code of Civil procedure section 473 “includes a discretionary
provision, which applies permissively, and a mandatory provision, which applies
as of right.” (Minick v. City of Petaluma (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 15, 25
(hereafter Minick).)  “Section 473
is a remedial statute to be “applied liberally” in favor of relief if the
opposing party will not suffer prejudice. 
Because the law strongly favors trial and disposition on the merits, any
doubts in applying section 473 must be resolved in favor of the party seeking
relief from default.  Unless inexcusable
neglect is clear, the policy favoring trial on the merits prevails.”  (Minick, supra, 3 Cal.App.5th at p. 24
[cleaned up].)  
 
The party or the legal
representative must seek such relief “within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was
taken.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); see Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980 [“because more than
six months had elapsed from the entry of default, and hence relief under
section 473 was unavailable”]; People v.
The North River Ins. Co. (2011) 200 Ca.App.4th 712, 721 [motion
for relief under section 473 must be brought “within a reasonable time, in no
case exceeding six months”]).  “The
six-month limit is mandatory; a court has no authority to grant relief under
section 473, subdivision (b), unless an application is made within the
six-month period.”  (Arambula v. Union Carbide Corp. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 333, 340,
citations omitted.)  
 
                                                                       
i.     DISCRETIONARY
RELIEF
 
Per Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b), a court may “relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” 
 
                                                                     
ii.     MANDATORY
RELIEF
 
Notwithstanding any other requirements of this
section, the court shall, whenever an application for relief is made no more
than six months after entry of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied
by an attorney's sworn affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect, vacate any
(1) resulting default entered by the clerk against his or her client, and which
will result in entry of a default judgment, or (2) resulting default judgment
or dismissal entered against his or her client, unless the
court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by the
attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)  “In considering whether the trial court
properly denied relief under section 473(b), the first question is the
sufficiency of defendants' showing of attorney fault, if believed, to trigger
the mandatory relief provisions of that statute.”  (Standard Microsystems Corp. v. Winbond
Electronics Corp. (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 868, 896, disapproved on other
grounds by Even Zohar Construction & Remodeling, Inc. v. Bellaire
Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 830 (hereafter Standard).)  “Under section 473(b), a party is entitled to
relief from a default and resulting judgment whenever, on timely application
for relief, his attorney ‘attest[s] to his or her mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or neglect’ in connection with the default or the judgment.”  (Ibid.)  
 
                       
II.         
ENFORCE SETTLEMENT
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides that “[i]f parties to
pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the
presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the case,
or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the
terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6.) In ruling on a motion to
enter judgment, the court acts as a trier of fact. The court must determine
whether the parties entered into a valid and binding settlement. To do so, the
court may receive oral testimony in addition to declarations. (Kohn v.
Jaymar-Ruby, Inc. (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1530, 1533.)
 
The issue on a motion to enforce settlement agreement under Code of
Civil Procedure section 664.6 is whether the parties entered into a valid and
binding settlement agreement. (See Viejo v. Bancorp. (1989) 217
Cal.App.3d 200, 209, fn. 4 [“a court's power to make factual determinations
under section 664.6 is generally limited to whether the parties entered into a
valid and binding settlement agreement”].) 
In other words, the only issue before the court is whether an agreement
exists; not whether the agreement has been breached.
 
DISCUSSION
 
            As a threshold matter, Code of Civil
Procedure section 1005 provides that written notice shall be given of all
moving and supporting papers at least 16 days prior to the hearing.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).)  
 
            Here, although Plaintiff has
provided a “Certificate of Service” that indicates “I hereby certify that on
October 4, 2024, a true and correct copy of the foregoing document was served
on Defendant via electronic mail” the Court finds the certificate to be
faulty.  First, it is not signed under
penalty of perjury, and therefore holds no evidentiary value.  It also does not indicate what electronic
service address was used to send the document or what electronic service
address the documents were sent to, or specifically what document(s) were
served on Defendant.  It also does not
specify Defendant’s name.  
 
            Therefore, Plaintiff has not met its
burden of demonstrating that it properly served the moving and supporting
papers on Defendant at least 16 days prior to the hearing.
 
CONCLUSION
 
            Therefore, the Court continues the
hearing to December 16, 2024 at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207 to enable Plaintiff
to perfect service, as necessary, and to provide proper proof to the Court of
such service.  
 
            Plaintiff shall also provide
Defendant with notice of this order and of the continued hearing and file the
notice with a proof of service forthwith.
