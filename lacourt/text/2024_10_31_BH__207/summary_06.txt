Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion for attorneys' fees and costs filed by the defendants, Pellequr LLC, Anna Margaryan, Dennis Colonello, and Steven Yoon Shin. The motion is unopposed and seeks to recover attorneys' fees and costs incurred in the amount of $82,001.15.

The judge finds that the defendants are the prevailing parties in this action, as summary judgment was entered in their favor and the plaintiff, Elite Financial Realty, LLC, did not recover any relief. The lease agreement and guaranty executed by the defendants provide that the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees.

The judge grants the motion for attorneys' fees only in the amount of $81,776.83, which is the amount requested by the defendants. The judge notes that the defendants incurred attorneys' fees at a rate of $400/hour and that the total amount of attorneys' fees incurred ($95,600) exceeds the amount requested ($81,776.83).

The judge orders the defendants to file and serve a proposed order in conformance with the court's ruling on or before November 15, 2024, and to provide notice of the court's ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
