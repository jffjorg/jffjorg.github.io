And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion by plaintiff 1427 Lincoln Santa Monica LLC to set aside a dismissal of the case and have judgment entered against defendant Nicholas Morris. The motion is unopposed. The judge notes that the case was originally filed in 2021 and that the plaintiff filed a notice of settlement in 2023. However, the plaintiff did not appear at an order to show cause re: settlement and the case was dismissed without prejudice.

The judge discusses the legal standards for setting aside a dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure section 473 and notes that the plaintiff must show that the dismissal was the result of the defendant's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The judge also discusses the requirements for enforcing a settlement agreement under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has not properly served the defendant with the moving and supporting papers and therefore continues the hearing to December 16, 2024 to enable the plaintiff to perfect service and provide proper proof to the court of such service. The judge also orders the plaintiff to provide the defendant with notice of the order and of the continued hearing and to file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
