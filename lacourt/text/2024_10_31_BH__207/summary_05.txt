Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a Tentative Ruling in the case of 24SMCV04559, addressing a demurrer filed by Defendant Aleshia Hunter to the Complaint filed by Plaintiffs Stocker Square, LLC and One Stocker Group, LLC. The demurrer claims that the Complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The Judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the Complaint adequately states a cause of action.

The Judge has also ordered that the Defendant shall file and serve an Answer to the Verified Complaint on or before November 8, 2024. Additionally, the Plaintiffs shall provide notice of the Court's ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.

The Judge's ruling is based on the principle that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint, and that a court must liberally construe the allegations of the complaint with a view to substantial justice between the parties. The Judge has also applied the rule that a complaint will be held good if it appears that the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of the court against the defendants, even if the facts are not clearly stated or are intermingled with other facts irrelevant to the cause of action.
