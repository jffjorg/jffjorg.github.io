MOTION
 
On September 20, 2024, Plaintiffs Stocker Square, LLC and One Stocker
Group, LLC (“Plaintiffs”) filed the unlawful detainer Complaint against
Defendant Aleshia Hunter (“Defendant”). 
Defendant demurs to the Complaint on the grounds that it fails to state
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 430, subdivision (e). 
Plaintiffs oppose the demurrer.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
               
I.         
DEMURRER
 
“It is black letter law that a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of
the allegations in a complaint.”  (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015)
235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  In testing the sufficiency of a cause of
action, a court accepts “[a]s true all material facts properly pled and matters
which may be judicially noticed but disregard contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.  [A court
also gives] the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole
and its parts in their context.”  (290
Division (EAT), LLC v. City & County of San Francisco (2022) 86
Cal.App.5th 439, 450 [cleaned up]; Hacker v. Homeward Residential, Inc.
(2018) 26 Cal.App.5th 270, 280 [“in considering the merits of a demurrer,
however, “the facts alleged in the pleading are deemed to be true, however
improbable they may be”].)
 
Further, in ruling on a demurrer, a court must “liberally construe”
the allegations of the complaint “with a view to substantial justice between
the parties.”  (See Code Civ. Proc., §
452.)  “This rule of liberal construction
means that the reviewing court draws inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not
the defendant.”  (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209
Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.)   
 
In summary, “[d]etermining whether the complaint is sufficient as
against the demurrer on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action, the rule is that if on consideration of all the
facts stated it appears the plaintiff is entitled to any relief at the hands of
the court against the defendants the complaint will be held good although the
facts may not be clearly stated, or may be intermingled with a statement of
other facts irrelevant to the cause of action shown, or although the plaintiff
may demand relief to which he is not entitled under the facts alleged.”  (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193
Cal.App.2d 636, 639.)
 
A.   
FAILURE TO STATE A CAUSE OF ACTION
 
Defendant demurs on the grounds that the 3-day Notice overstates the
amount of rent due.  The Demurrer
contains no accompanying memorandum of points and authorities, and merely
states that the amount of rent due listed on the 3-day notice is overstated.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1161(2) provides:
 
When the tenant continues in possession, in
person or by subtenant, without the permission of the landlord, or the
successor in estate of the landlord, if applicable, after default in the
payment of rent, pursuant to the lease or agreement under which the property is
held, and three days’ notice, excluding Saturdays and Sundays and other
judicial holidays, in writing, requiring its payment, stating the amount that
is due, the name, telephone number, and address of the person to whom the rent
payment shall be made, and, if payment may be made personally, the usual days
and hours that person will be available to receive the payment (provided that,
if the address does not allow for personal delivery, then it shall be
conclusively presumed that upon the mailing of any rent or notice to the owner
by the tenant to the name and address provided, the notice or rent is deemed
received by the owner on the date posted, if the tenant can show proof of
mailing to the name and address provided by the owner), or the number of an
account in a financial institution into which the rental payment may be made,
and the name and street address of the institution (provided that the
institution is located within five miles of the rental property), or if an
electronic funds transfer procedure has been previously established, that
payment may be made pursuant to that procedure, or possession of the property,
shall have been served upon the tenant and if there is a subtenant in actual
occupation of the premises, also upon the subtenant.
 
Here, the 3-day “Notice to Pay
Rent or Quit” attached to the verified Complaint, dated September 11, 2024
outlines the outstanding rent due as follows:
 
Date Amount Became Due               Amount

09/01/2024                                          $6,350.00 
08/01/2024                                          $6,350,00  
07/01/2024                                          $6,350.00 
06/01/2024                                          $6,350.00 
05/01/2024                                          $6,350.00 
 
Total Delinquent Rent:
$31,750.00
 
            The verified Complaint similarly
indicates that monthly rent is $6,350 (Complaint ¶ 6) and Plaintiff requests
past-due rent of $31,750 (Complaint ¶ 19). 
Thus, there is nothing on the
face of the verified Complaint that indicates the amount of delinquent rent is
overstated on the 3-Day Notice.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
For the reasons stated, the Court overrules Defendant’s Demurrer.  Defendant shall file and serve an Answer to
the Verified Complaint on or before November 8, 2024.  
 
Plaintiffs shall provide notice of the Court’s ruling and file the
notice with a proof of service forthwith.
