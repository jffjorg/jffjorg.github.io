And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is overruled. The plaintiff, Msrop E. Movsisian, filed the complaint against the defendant, Escrow Time, Inc., alleging causes of action for professional negligence and breach of contract. The defendant demurred, arguing that the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action. However, the judge found that the demurrer is flawed, as it relies on extrinsic facts and fails to analyze the allegations in the complaint. The judge further found that the defendant did not properly meet the requirements for a demurrer. As a result, the judge has overruled the defendant's demurrer and ordered the defendant to file and serve its answer to the complaint within 20 days.
