And here is the English text to summarize this judge's tentative ruling:

The court has identified a deficiency in the plaintiff's default judgment packet. The plaintiff's explanation for why it is entitled to recover funds is inadequate, as it assumes familiarity with the facts of the case and does not address the standing issue. Specifically, the plaintiff has not explained why it is entitled to recover funds paid by Zhao and Zhang, rather than the money it itself claims it paid for the two vehicles. The court notes that Lexury was unjustly enriched by the payments, but this does not necessarily mean that the plaintiff is entitled to recover those payments. The plaintiff will be given one final opportunity to address this issue, with 30 days to provide a revised explanation.
