And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling states that Plaintiff Maria L. Torres Gil's motion to compel initial responses to her Demands for Inspection is moot. The Court declines to award sanctions at this time. The Plaintiff filed suit against General Motors, LLC (Defendant) alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Act on February 17, 2023. The Plaintiff served the Defendant with Demands for Inspection on August 1, 2023, but the Defendant did not provide a timely response. The Defendant claims it has since provided responses to the discovery requests, and the Plaintiff did not satisfy her meet and confer obligations with regard to this motion. Therefore, the Court finds that the Plaintiff's motion to compel initial responses is moot, and sanctions are not appropriate at this time.
