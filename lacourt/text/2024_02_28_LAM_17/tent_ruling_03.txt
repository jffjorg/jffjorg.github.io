  vs.
 
FCC LOGISTICS,
  INC., et al. 


 Case
  No.:  BC714907
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  February 28, 2024



 
 
 
            After
review, the Court has identified the following deficiency with Plaintiff’s
default judgment packet:
 
-        
Plaintiff’s explanation remains
inadequate, largely because it assumes familiarity with the facts of the case,
and still does not address the standing issue. 
 
Plaintiff has
still not explained why it is entitled to a sum paid by Zhao and Zhang, rather
than the money it itself claims it paid for the two vehicles. While the Court
understands that Lexury was unjustly enriched by the payments remitted by Zhao,
Plaintiff was not detrimentally impacted by these payments given that
Plaintiff did not make these payments. Plaintiff has still not offered any
explanation as to why it has standing to recover funds wrongfully obtained by
Lexury but which it did not pay. The mere fact that Lexury was unjustly
enriched by the payments does not mean that Plaintiff is entitled to recover
those payments, given that it has not offered any connection to those
payments. 
 
Plaintiff
will be afforded one final opportunity to address this. Plaintiff has 30 days.
