US
  WAREHOUSE, INC. 
 


 Case No.: 23STCV12452 
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  February 28, 2024



 
Plaintiff’s request to vacate the
default judgment in this action is GRANTED. Plaintiff’s case is dismissed
pursuant to the dismissal filed 1/26/2024.  

 
            On 6/1/2023, Plaintiff Jamison 5455
Wilshire, LLC (Plaintiff) filed an unlawful detainer action against US
Warehouse, Inc. 
 
            On 7/10/2023, default was entered
against Defendant. 
 
On 7/13/2023, Plaintiff obtained a default judgment. 
 
On 7/26/2023, a writ of possession was issued and
Defendant was locked out of the Premises on 10/10/2023 by the Los Aneles County
Sherriff’s Department. 
 
Now, on 1/26/2024, Plaintiff moves for the Court to
vacate the default judgment, and dismiss this action.
 
The motion is unopposed.
 
Discussion

 
            Plaintiff seeks to vacate the
default and default judgment it obtained on the basis that Plaintiff and
Defendant have entered a new lease amendment for continuance of their lease
term. Plaintiff then intends to dismiss this action.
 
Pursuant to CCP section 473c, the court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or
her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.
 
            Here, the
circumstances are a bit unusual in that it is Plaintiff who is seeking
to set aside his own judgment. However, given the Court’s authority to set
aside default judgments against Defendant, the Court’s authority must
naturally extend to setting aside a judgment at the prevailing party’s own
request. This is especially true when the setting aside of default is necessary
for Plaintiff to dismiss this action, and Plaintiff has already filed a pending
dismissal.
 
            Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s request to vacate the default judgment in this action is
granted. Plaintiff’s case is dismissed pursuant to the dismissal filed
1/26/2024.   
 
 
It is so ordered.
