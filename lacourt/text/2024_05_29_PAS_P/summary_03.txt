And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants Defendant Xuesong Guan's unopposed motion for leave to amend and file a first amended answer. The motion is supported by the declaration of Guan's attorney, James Andion, who explains that Guan had mistakenly filed an answer prior to retaining him as counsel due to a misunderstanding about the court process and advice from others. The judge finds that the procedural requirements are met and that the motion is not untimely. The judge orders Guan to file and serve the proposed 1st Amended Answer on Plaintiff Deeson Pan within 30 days' notice of this order.
