  Case Number:  23AHCV01599    Hearing Date:   May 29, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER SUSTAINING THE DEMURRER TO THE THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION WITHOUT LEAVE TO
AMEND; GRANTING MOTION TO STRIKEI.        INTRODUCTION
          In this insurance coverage action, Plaintiffs Tristan C.
Hatfield and Lucille Annkilsby Renville allege that Renville had automobile
insurance coverage provided by Defendant California Casualty Indemnity
Exchange. Plaintiffs allege that on August 22, 2015, they got in a car (Renfield)
versus motorcycle (Hatfield) accident in which Hatfield was seriously
injured.  Hatfield made a policy limit
($100,000) demand to Defendant, which Defendant did not pay.  In 2022, Hatfield obtained a judgment against
Renville of over $9,000,000.  Hatfield
and Renville then jointly brought this action against Defendant, alleging three
causes of action: (1) Breach of the Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing,
(2) Breach of Contract and (3) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.
          Defendant filed the instant demurrer and motion to strike
on December 15, 2023. Plaintiffs filed an opposition on May 15, 2024.
Defendants filed a reply on May 21, 2024.
Before
the Court are Defendant’s challenges to the third cause of action in the second
amended complaint. Defendant alleges that the third cause of action fails to
state sufficient facts. Defendant also moves to strike punitive damages and
attorney fees. 
The
demurrer is sustained. The motion to strike is granted.II.      DEMURRER
A. Legal Standard
Code
Civ. Proc. Section 430.10(e) provides for a demurrer on the basis that a
complaint fails to state a cause of action. (CCP § 430.10(e).) A demurrer tests
the legal sufficiency of a complaint. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  A demurrer is treated as “admitting all
material facts properly pleaded,” but not the truth of “contentions, deductions
or conclusions of law.” (Aubry v. Tri-Defendants Hospital Dist. (1992) 2
Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) The general rule on demurrer is that the pleadings are
“deemed to be true, however improbable they may be.” (Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.4th 593, 604.) 
Questions
of plaintiff’s ability to prove unlikely allegations are of no concern. (Committee
on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
213-214.)
Allegations
need not be accepted as true if they are contradicted by judicially noticeable
facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462,
1474.) 
“We
treat the demurrer as admitting all the properly pleaded material facts and
consider matters which may be judicially noticed, but we do not treat as
admitted contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. (Align
Technology, Inc. v. Tran (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 949, 958 [102 Cal.Rptr.3d
343].) Further, ‘ “ ‘we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading
it as a whole and its parts in their context.’ ”’ (Ibid.) Because a
demurrer tests only the legal sufficiency of the pleading, we accept as true
even the most improbable alleged facts, and we do not concern ourselves with
the plaintiff's ability to prove its factual allegations. (Ibid.)
‘“Facts appearing in exhibits attached to the first amended complaint also are
accepted as true and are given precedence, to the extent they contradict the
allegations.”’ (Paul v. Patton (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 1088, 1091.)
Although a demurrer does not ordinarily reach affirmative defenses, it ‘“will
lie where the complaint ‘has included allegations that clearly disclose some
defense or bar to recovery.’ ”’ (Casterson v. Superior Court (2002) 101
Cal.App.4th 177, 183, Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015) 236
Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406. )
Code
Civ. Proc. Section 430.10(f) provides for a demurrer where a pleading is
uncertain. (CCP § 430.10(f).) Demurrers for uncertainty are disfavored and are
only sustained where a pleading is so incomprehensible a defendant cannot
reasonably respond. (A.J. Fistes v. GDL Best
Contractors, Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 695; Khoury v. Maly’s of California (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)
          B. Meet and Confer Requirement Met
          The Declaration of Christopher P. Wesierski is offered in
support of counsel’s compliance with Code Civ. Proc. Section 430.41. Wesierski
declares that he sent a meet and confer letter to Plaintiff’s counsel on
November 27, 2023. (Wesierski Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. A.) Parties were unable to come
to a resolution. (See Wesierski Decl. Exh. B.) 
The
meet and confer requirement has been met. 
          C. Analysis
           “The elements of a
cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress are (1) the
defendant engages in extreme and outrageous conduct with the intent to cause,
or with reckless disregard for the probability of causing, emotional distress;
(2) the plaintiff suffers extreme or severe emotional distress; and (3) the
defendant’s extreme and outrageous conduct was the actual and proximate cause
of the plaintiff’s extreme or severe emotional distress.” (Potter v.
Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 965, 1001.) “[O]utrageous
conduct is conduct that is intentional or reckless and so extreme as to exceed
all bounds of decency in a civilized community.” (Ibid.) The defendant’s
conduct must be directed to the plaintiff, but malicious or evil purpose is not
essential to liability. (So v. Shin (2013) 212
Cal.App.4th 652, 671, internal citations omitted.) 
          Here, the second amended complaint (SAC) alleges that the
Defendants refused to cover the injuries and damages Plaintiffs sustained from
the accident, (SAC ¶ 43), intentionally refused Plaintiffs’ settlement offer
(SAC ¶¶ 44-48) and Plaintiffs suffered distress due to Defendant’s conduct,
including missing classes, missing a job opportunity, and being forced to
litigate this case. (SAC ¶¶ 50, 54.) However, extreme and outrageous conduct on
the part of the Defendant is not alleged nor is extreme emotional distress.
Participating in the court process does not amount to extreme emotional
distress. Denying coverage or settlement offers does not rise to the level of
extreme and outrageous conduct. This issue is not resolved by Plaintiffs’ opposition.
(See Opposition p. 3-7, Reply p. 2: 21-24.)
          The
demurrer to the third cause of action is sustained without leave to amend.
III.     MOTION
TO STRIKE
           A.
Legal Standard
          Code Civ. Proc. §436 provides: “The court may, upon a
motion made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon
terms it deems proper:
(a) Strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.
(b) Strike out all or any
part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this
state, a court rule, or an order of the court.”       
Civ.
Code § 3294(a) provides that where it is proven by clear and convincing
evidence that a defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, the
plaintiff may recover punitive damages. (CC § 3294.)
Attorney
fees are only available if provided for by statute or contract. (Code Civ.
Proc. §§ 1021, 1035(a)(10).)
B.
Motion to Strike is Granted 
As
the demurrer to the third cause of action for intentional infliction of
emotional distress is sustained, there is no cause of action from which
punitive damages can be requested. Additionally, there are no factual allegations
of oppression, fraud or malice. (See Reply p.4.) The motion to strike punitive
damages is granted.
Defendant
also seeks to strike attorney fees. The Court agrees. The SAC does not allege a
right to recover fees under either statute or contract; the insurance policy
attached to the pleading does not contain an attorney fee provision.[1] Without
such basis, the Court strikes the request.
The
motion to strike is granted.
IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
 Defendant California Casualty Insurance
Exchange’s demurrer is sustained without leave to amend. The motion to strike
is granted. 
          Counsel for California Casualty Insurance Exchange to give
notice of this order.
