And here is the English text summarizing the tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the third cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The Court has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning that the plaintiffs cannot re-file the complaint. The Court has also granted the motion to strike punitive damages and attorney fees. The Court has determined that the third cause of action is insufficient and that the defendant's refusal to cover the injuries and damages does not rise to the level of extreme and outrageous conduct. The Court has also determined that the plaintiffs have no basis for requesting punitive damages or attorney fees.
