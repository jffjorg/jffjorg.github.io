INDEMNITY INSURANCE COMPANY and Defendant Miguel Pacheco
(“Defendants”) seek a trial continuance from April 10, 2024 to August 8,
2024.  Because the parties are seeking to conduct additional
depositions and to have additional discovery motions heard, the Court finds
good cause to continue trial until April 25, 2024, the maximum period allowed under
CCP § 36.  On April 2, 2024, the Court appointed a discovery referee
for the depositions of Harry Naldzyan, Sammy Sahakyan, Kristine Naldzyan, Gary
Mouradian, and Miguel Pacheco.  The
parties should be prepared to advise the court what dates have been selected
for these and the remaining depositions.   
Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to continue trial is
GRANTED in part.  Trial is continued from
April 10, 2024 to April 25, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-F.
