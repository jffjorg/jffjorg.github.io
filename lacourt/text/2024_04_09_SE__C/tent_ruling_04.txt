#9 
Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiff Erik Moreno’s Motion to Consolidate
is DENIED. 
Defendant to give notice. 
 
Background
Plaintiff Erik Moreno (“Plaintiff”) originally filed a
complaint in this Court on July 12, 2016 against Defendant Martha Moreno
(“Defendant”) for Quiet Title to real properties commonly known as 10231
Trabuco Street, Bellflower, California 90706 and 11829 Arkansas Street
(collectively “the Properties”). Plaintiff dismissed his complaint against
Defendant on August 11, 2021. On January 29, 2019, Defendant filed a
cross-complaint against Plaintiff for: 1. Breach of Fiduciary Duty 2.
Conversion 3. Waste 4. Unjust Enrichment 5. Constructive Trust 6. Intentional
Misrepresentation 7. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress and 8.
Declaratory Relief.  Default was entered
against Plaintiff on May 10, 2019 as to the cross-complaint and judgment was
entered on May 10, 2022. Plaintiff has appealed the default. Plaintiff then
filed this Complaint on May 20, 2022 against Defendant which contains many of
the same allegations as his previous lawsuit. 
Defendant answered on June 20, 2022 and then filed a demurrer on
September 26, 2022.
Plaintiff now seeks to consolidate this case (22NWCV00388)
with the unlawful detainer actions (23NWUD00749 and 23NWUD00751) brought
against Erik and Raul Moreno with regard to the described property located at
10231 Trabuco Street, Bellflower, CA, 90706.
Legal
Standard 
 
Code
Civ. Proc.,¿§ 1048, subd.¿(a) states, “[w]hen actions involving a common
question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a joint
hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it may
order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning
proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.” (Code
Civ. Proc.,¿§ 1048,¿subd.¿(a);¿see also¿Spector v. Superior Court¿(1961)
55 Cal.2d 839, 844 [Two actions that present essentially the same, or
overlapping, issues should be consolidated and disposed of as a single
proceeding].)¿¿¿ 
¿ 
Consolidation,
however, is not a matter of right; it rests solely within the sound discretion
of the trial judge. (Fisher v. Nash Bldg. Co.¿(1952) 113 Cal.App.2d 397,
402.)¿ Actions may be thoroughly “related” in the sense of having common
questions of law or fact, and still not be “consolidated,” if the trial court,
in the sound exercise of its discretion, chooses not to do so.¿ (Askew v.
Askew¿(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 942, 964.)¿ It is not abuse of discretion to
deny motion for consolidation of actions where parties in each action are
different or issues are different.¿ (See¿Muller v. Robinson¿(1959) 174
Cal App 2d 511, 515.)¿ On the other hand, actions may be consolidated in the
discretion of the trial court whenever it can be done without prejudice to a
substantial right.¿ (Carpenson¿v.¿Najarian¿(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 856,
862.) 
 
In
deciding whether to grant a motion to consolidate, the court should weigh
whether the common issues predominate over the individual issues and whether
any risks of jury confusion or prejudice to the parties outweighs the reduction
in time and expense that would result from consolidation.¿ (Todd-Stenberg v.
Shield¿(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 976, 978.)¿ 
 
Discussion 
 
Plaintiff
contends that the actions should be consolidated because there are common
questions of law and fact concerning the cloud on title and right of
possession.  Consolidation will save judicial resources.  
 
Defendant
Martha Moreno contends that the actions do not share common questions of law
and fact.  Defendant Moreno argues that she sold and conveyed title
to the properties to Heydi Caceres, the plaintiff in both unlawful detainer
actions.  In those actions, Plaintiff has
been evicted from the subject property. 
Defendant argues these
claims should be barred due to res judicata and the unlawful detainer actions
are now moot, given the evictions. Under these
circumstances, the Court declines to consolidate this matter with the unlawful
detainer actions.  
 
Accordingly,
the motion is DENIED.
