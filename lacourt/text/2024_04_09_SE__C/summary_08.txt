Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to have requests for admissions deemed admitted and awards sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,200.00. The plaintiff alleges that on June 9, 2021, he was struck by the defendant's vehicle while in a wheelchair in a crosswalk. The plaintiff propounded discovery, including requests for admissions, and the defense counsel requested extensions of time to respond to the discovery. Despite these requests, no discovery responses were provided as of the date of the filing of this motion. The court finds that the defendant's failure to respond to discovery constitutes misuse of the discovery process and awards sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,200.00.
