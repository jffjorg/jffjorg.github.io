And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the Petitioner's motion to deposit surplus funds and discharge the Petitioner. The Petitioner, Quality Loan Service Corp., is the trustee under a Deed of Trust executed by Raul Ruvalcaba. The Deed of Trust was secured by real property located at 7716 Stewart and Grey Road #B, Downey, CA 90241. After a non-judicial foreclosure sale, there remained surplus funds in the amount of $266,619.97. The Petitioner sent written notice to all persons with recorded interests in the subject property, but Raul Ruvalcaba failed to respond with a claim or waiver of claim. The Petitioner filed a petition and declaration regarding unresolved claims and deposit of undistributed surplus proceeds, and a motion to deposit surplus funds and discharge. The judge finds that the Petitioner has complied with all procedural requirements outlined in Civil Code § 2924j and has demonstrated that, despite due diligence, the Petitioner is unable to distribute the surplus funds associated with the non-judicial foreclosure sale of the subject property. Therefore, the Petitioner is granted permission to deposit the surplus funds with the court and is discharged of further responsibility for the disbursement of sale proceeds.
