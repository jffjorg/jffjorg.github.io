And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Erik Moreno's motion to consolidate his case with the unlawful detainer actions (23NWUD00749 and 23NWUD00751) brought against him and Raul Moreno regarding the property at 10231 Trabuco Street, Bellflower, CA 90706. The judge has declined to consolidate the cases, citing that the actions do not share common questions of law and fact. The defendant, Martha Moreno, argued that she sold and conveyed title to the properties to Heydi Caceres, the plaintiff in the unlawful detainer actions, and that these claims should be barred due to res judicata and the unlawful detainer actions are now moot given the evictions. The court has weighed the potential benefits of consolidation against the potential risks of jury confusion or prejudice to the parties and has determined that consolidation is not warranted in this case.
