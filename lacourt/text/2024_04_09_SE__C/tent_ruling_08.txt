#5 
Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiff Jorge Martinez’s Motion to Have Requests
for Admissions (Set One) Deemed Admitted is GRANTED. Sanctions are awarded in
the reduced amount of $1,200.00.
Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
This motion is unopposed as of April 3, 2024.  
 
Background 
Plaintiff Jorge Martinez {“Plaintiff”) alleges that on June
9, 2021, he was seated in his wheelchair and entered the crosswalk on Pioneer
Boulevard at the onramp to the 91 Freeway. While Plaintiff was in the
crosswalk, he was struck by Defendant Allen Joseph Charbonnet who was traveling
in a vehicle registered to Defendant the Word of God Ministry
(“Defendants”).  
Legal Standard 
Pursuant to CCP § 2033.280, if a party to whom requests for
admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the party to whom the
requests for admission are directed waives any objection to the requests,
including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product. (CCP §2033.280(a).) 
The requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of
any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction. (CCP
§2033.280(b).)  It is mandatory that
the court impose a monetary sanction on the party or attorney, or both, whose
failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion. (CCP §2033.280(c).)  
Discussion
On August 9, 2023, Plaintiff propounded discovery,
including Requests for Admissions (Set One) upon Defendant Word of God
Ministries. (Freedman Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. 2.) On or about September 8, 2023,
counsel for the defendants emailed Plaintiff’s counsel requesting an extension
of time to respond to all the outstanding discovery. (Freedman Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. 3.)
On October 1, 2023, defense counsel again requested an extension of time to
respond to Plaintiff’s discovery and proposed October 13, 2023. On October 2, 2023,
Plaintiff’s counsel agreed to an additional extension to October 13, 2023 on condition
that code complaint and good faith discovery responses and responsive documents
be provided. (Freedman Decl., at ¶ 5, Ex. 4.) Despite further attempts to
secure discovery responses, none have been provided as of the date of the
filing of this motion. (Freedman Decl., ¶ 11.) 

Plaintiff’s Motion is GRANTED. 
 
Sanctions 
Misuse of the
discovery process constituting conduct subject to sanctions include “failing to
respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery” and “failing to
confer in person, by telephone, or by letter with an opposing party or attorney
in a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve informally any dispute
concerning discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subds. (d) and (i).) The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that
conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).)
Plaintiff requests sanctions in the amount of $5,156.25 for
2.5 hours drafting and researching the motion, .5 hours preparing the
declaration, .25 hours preparing the proposed order, 2 hours reading and
replying to any opposition, and 1 hour preparing and attending the hearing at a
rate of $825.00 per hour. Given the simplicity of the motion and the lack of
opposition, the Court awards sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,200.00.  The Court notes that there are six other
discovery motions pending in this action.
