Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Tawana Jean Cooper's Motion to Compel Responses to Requests for Production of Documents (Set Two). The judge finds that the responses to the request for production of documents were properly verified and did not require an oath on the response itself. The judge also finds that the responses were not improper because they were based on "information and belief" and that this is a common practice for corporate discovery responses. The judge denies Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $5,000.00 and also denies Defendant's request for sanctions. The judge notes that Plaintiff's good faith belief in the merit of her arguments is important, but also warns that future motions with the same grounds may cast doubt on Plaintiff's good faith belief.
