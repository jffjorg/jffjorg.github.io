And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant's motion for summary judgment is granted. The plaintiff, Rosa M. Kingsbury, alleged that the defendant, Ralphs Grocery Company, maintained the premises in an unsafe condition, which caused her to fall and injure herself on April 24, 2020. However, the defendant presented evidence that the alleged dangerous condition was open and obvious, and the plaintiff failed to show that the defendant intentionally maintained the premises in an unsafe condition.

The defendant also presented evidence that the plaintiff intentionally placed her foot on the pallet and caused herself to fall. The plaintiff's expert witness, Ryan Radebach, opined that the defendant failed to provide a safe walkway for patrons inside the store, but his opinion was based on an inaccurate understanding of the facts. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of material fact as to the first cause of action for negligence.

As for the second cause of action for violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act, the court finds that the defendant did not intentionally discriminate against the plaintiff based on her age, marital status, or gender. The court concludes that the defendant's employees provided the plaintiff with assistance and did not intentionally discriminate against her.
