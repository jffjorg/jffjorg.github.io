Tentative Ruling 
Defendants’ Motion to Stay
Proceeding Pending Outcome of the Related Case is DENIED.  In the alternative, the request by the
parties to consolidate this case (23NWCV01111) with the related case, Kloss
v. Dawood (23NWCV02306) is GRANTED, with this case acting as the lead
case.  All dates in the related case are
VACATED and reset in this case.  

Defendants to give notice. 
 
Defendants move for an order staying this unlawful detainer
action pending the outcome of the related case, Kloss v. Dawood, No.
23NWCV02306 (“Related Case”).  
Background 
This is an unlawful detainer action filed on April 12, 2023
by Plaintiff Medline Management Corporation (“Medline”).  Although the complaint alleges Medline is the
“Owner-Landlord” of the subject property, Medline contends it is actually the
property manager for the true owner, Quantum Properties, LLC, which Defendant
Kloss has sued in the Related Case.  The Related
Case alleges that Kloss’s interest in the subject property was fraudulently
transferred utilizing a shell corporation controlled and managed by the
defendants in the Related Case. 
Medline concurs that Defendants have raised the issue of
title as an affirmative defense in this UD Action, and issues of title and
right to possession should not be tried in an unlawful detainer action.  However, instead of staying this UD action,
Medline proposes, and Defendants agree, that this action should be consolidated
with the Related Case in the interests of judicial economy.   
Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to Stay Proceeding Pending
Outcome of the Related Case is DENIED.  The
request by the parties to consolidate this case (23NWCV01111) with the related
case, Kloss v. Dawood (23NWCV02306) is GRANTED, with this case acting as
the lead case.
