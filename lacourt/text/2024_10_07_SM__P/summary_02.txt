And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Equinox's motion for summary judgment, which seeks to dismiss the claims brought by Homerin against Equinox and Stages Cycling, LLC. Homerin alleges that an Equinox employee negligently failed to properly secure the toe-cage on her bike during an indoor cycling class, causing her injury.

Equinox argues that Homerin signed an express waiver of liability, which bars her claim, and that she assumed the primary risk of indoor cycling by participating in the activity. However, Homerin disputes the existence of the waiver and argues that Equinox employee Amy Robertson substantially increased the risk of harm to her by failing to properly attach the toe-cage and ignoring her request for help.

The judge has ruled that the opposition to Equinox's motion was filed one day late, but will still be considered on its merits. The judge has also denied Equinox's request for summary judgment, as there are triable issues of fact regarding the existence of a liability waiver and whether Equinox employee increased the risk of harm to Homerin. The case will proceed to a hearing on October 7, 2024, where the judge will make a final ruling on the motion.
