And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to enforce a settlement agreement between Woodson (the plaintiff) and Darvish (the defendant). The parties entered into a settlement agreement on October 22, 2021, under which Darvish was to make monthly payments of $5,000 to Woodson for a total of $250,000. However, Darvish defaulted on the payments after making 15 payments totaling $73,700. Woodson is seeking to enforce the settlement and is requesting a judgment for the full stipulated amount of $250,000, as well as attorney's fees, costs, interest, and sanctions. The judge has granted the motion to enforce the settlement, but has reduced the amount of the judgment to the outstanding balance of $176,300 (the difference between the stipulated amount and the total payments made). The judge has also awarded Woodson attorney's fees of $1,600, payable within 30 days.
