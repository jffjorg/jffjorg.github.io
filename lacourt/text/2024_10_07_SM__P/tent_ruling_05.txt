Rejaei v. Siegel, Case no. SC126782
Hearing date October 7, 2024
Defendant
Siegel’s Motion for Return of Overcollection of Judgement
After
trial, plaintiffs requested costs totaling $127,220.30. The court taxed
plaintiffs’ costs by $64,613.25, awarding $62,607.05 in costs. Prior to the
court’s final ruling on plaintiffs’ costs, defendant Siegel placed funds into
escrow to satisfy the judgment against him, and plaintiffs withdrew funds,
including the full amount requested of $127,220.30. 
Upon
the court’s ruling on costs, defendant Siegel demanded return of the excess
$64,613.25 which was withdrawn by plaintiffs. Plaintiffs initially returned
only $48,882.90. After defendant Siegel filed this motion, plaintiffs returned
the remaining $15,730.35. Defendant seeks interest on the $15,730.35, as well
as attorney’s fees of $11,699. Plaintiffs request the court address arguments
raised at the 4/29/2024 hearing on motions to tax costs.
Plaintiffs
allege, and defendant concedes, that after the filing of this motion plaintiffs
returned the initially requested funds.
Interest
Defendant
argues he is entitled to interest on the improperly collected and unreturned
funds but offers no legal authority to support this contention; he argues “[f]or
every wrong there is a remedy.” Civ. Code §3523. Defendant’s improperly
collected funds were returned; as far as the initial funds go, defendant has
been made whole. Without legal argument or authority as to the basis under
which the court could order payment of such interest, the request is inappropriate
and must be denied.
Attorney’s Fees
Defendant
argues he is entitled to attorney’s fees incurred in connection with this
motion. Defendant argues sanctions are properly imposed against a party where
that party fails to timely comply with a court order requiring that party to
transfer property to the other party. Rayan v. Dykeman (1990) 224
Cal.App.3d 1629, 1636. 
No
such court order was issued here. Indeed, this motion was filed to seek such an
order, so seeking sanctions based on plaintiffs’ failure to return property pursuant
to an order is premature until such order issues. 
However,
per Code Civ. Proc. §128.5(a), the court may “order a party, the party’s
attorney, or both, to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by another party as a result of actions or tactics, made in bad faith,
that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.” Id.
The court agrees with defendant that plaintiffs erred in over-collecting on
their judgement and then subsequently failed to return the difference to
defendant once notified of their error. Whether defendant is awarded fees
depends on whether plaintiffs also acted in bad faith.
Plaintiffs
argue they relied on the court’s ruling on submitted matters to determine that
the costs taxed would add up to $48,788.04. Plaintiffs assert they believed the
court’s final ruling supplanted the court’s tentative ruling, which initially
taxed costs at $64,777.55. 
This
argument is unavailing. Plaintiffs returned $48,882.90 upon defendant’s initial
request. Decl. Angulo para. 8. This alone does not match what plaintiffs argue
they believe they owed.
Further,
plaintiffs do not explain how the court’s language “The tentative ruling issued
on 02/16/24 is adopted as the final order of the Court with the following
amendments” left room for ambiguity regarding what costs were taxed. Decl. Angulo
para. 6, ex. D. 
Plaintiffs
offer no reasonable explanation for their timely failure to return the
over-collected funds once defendant made them aware of the discrepancy.
Plaintiffs point to their eventual return of the requested funds following
filing of this motion as proof of good faith. The court disagrees. This motion
should not have been necessary after the issue was pointed out to plaintiffs.
Plaintiffs delayed until after this motion was filed. An award of fees is appropriate.

Defendant
seeks $11,699 in attorney’s fees, for work by (1) Alejandro Angulo, partner, at
$800/hour for 4.5 hours; (2) Marcel Budiono, associate, at $460/hour for 12.7
hours spent researching and drafting the motion; and (3) Nicholas Boroski,
summer associate, at $305/hour for 7.4 hours spent outlining the motion. Decl. Angulo
para. 9.
Two
attorneys and a summer associate spending 24.6 hours is excessive. The court awards
all the time by Budiono (460/hr. x 12.7 hours), 2.5 hours by Angulo (800/hr. x
2.5 hours) and 3 hours by Boroski (305/hr. x 3 hours). Payable within 30 days.
Plaintiffs
request that the court address arguments raised by plaintiffs’ counsel on
4/29/2024. The court issued an order pursuant to those arguments and need not
return to those issues. 
Defendant’s
motion for an order directing plaintiffs to return the improperly collected
funds is DENIED AS MOOT, as the funds have been returned.
Defendant’s
request for interest on the improperly collected funds is DENIED.
Defendant’s
request for attorney’s fees pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §128.5(a) is GRANTED.
