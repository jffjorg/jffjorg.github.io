Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Rejaei v. Siegel, Case no. SC126782. The case involves a dispute over the collection of costs totaling $127,220.30, which were taxed by the court at $64,613.25. The defendant, Siegel, had placed funds into escrow to satisfy the judgment, and the plaintiffs withdrew the full amount requested, including the excess $64,613.25.

The defendant has moved for the return of the excess funds, which were not returned promptly. The court has denied the defendant's request for interest on the improperly collected funds, as the defendant has not provided any legal authority to support this contention.

The court has granted the defendant's request for attorney's fees, finding that the plaintiffs acted in bad faith by over-collecting on their judgment and failing to return the excess funds promptly. The court has awarded the defendant $11,699 in attorney's fees, with the amount payable within 30 days.

The court has also denied the defendant's request for an order directing the plaintiffs to return the improperly collected funds, as the funds have already been returned.
