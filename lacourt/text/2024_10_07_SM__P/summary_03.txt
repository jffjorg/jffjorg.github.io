And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Honorable Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Amend their complaint. The Plaintiffs, Jonathan and Sara Abitbol, are suing the Defendants, Pico Eleven, LLC and BD Management Company, LLC, for breach of lease, breach of the implied warranty of habitability, nuisance, negligence, NIED, and fraudulent concealment. The Plaintiffs are seeking leave to amend their complaint, which would add new allegations and delete some existing ones. The Defendants argue that the Plaintiffs' declaration is defective and that the proposed amendments would necessitate more discovery. However, the Judge has ruled that the Plaintiffs' declaration satisfies the requirements of the California Rules of Court and that the proposed amendments are necessary and proper. The Judge has granted the motion, allowing the Plaintiffs to file the amended complaint within 10 court days.
