Woodson v. Darvish, Case no. 19SMCV00632
Hearing date October 7, 2024
Plaintiff
Woodson’s Motion to Enforce Settlement
Plaintiff
sued defendant on 4/3/2019 for professional negligence. The parties entered
into a settlement agreement for $250,000 on 10/22/2021, under which defendant
was to make monthly payments of $5,000. Plaintiff alleges defendant defaulted
after making 15 payments totaling $73,700, with the last payment on 9/13/2023.
Plaintiff moves to enforce the agreement per Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §664.6 and seeks
a judgement for the stipulated amount of $250,000 and requests attorney’s fees,
costs, interest and sanctions.
Per
Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §664.6, a court may retain jurisdiction to enforce a
settlement if the parties stipulate to continued jurisdiction in a signed
writing or orally before the court. The parties orally stipulated to such on
10/22/2021. Plaint. ex. A pgs. 2-3. The court has jurisdiction to enforce this
settlement and retains jurisdiction per §664.6. 
There
is no opposition to the motion, so the motion is GRANTED. However, the amount
of the judgment will be for the outstanding balance, not the full stipulated
amount, as defendant has partially paid and should be credited for the amounts
paid. 
The
settlement agreement contained an attorney’s fee and costs provision in the
event of enforcement. Plaint. ex. A, pg. 3. The court has jurisdiction to award
costs and fees. 
Plaintiff
presented a declaration that defendant breached settlement. Decl. Verlato
paras. 7-8. Counsel bills time at $400 per hour and spent three hours preparing
the motion and anticipates billing one additional hour at the hearing on the
motion. Decl. Verlato para. 9. The hourly rate is not excessive, nor is the 4
hours requested. The court issues fees of $1,600, payable within 30 days.
The
court declines to further sanction defendant. The award of fees sufficiently
recompenses plaintiff for the delay that seeking enforcement presents, and the
recovery of the remainder of the settlement will make plaintiff whole. Plaintiff
to provide a proposed order consistent with this minute order.
