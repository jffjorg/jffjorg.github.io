And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Yosef Shalom, has moved to set aside his default and vacate the default judgment entered against him. The court finds that the defendant's default resulted from a simple, excusable mistake made by his counsel, who accidentally calendared the response date for the wrong year. As a result, the counsel did not timely follow up with the plaintiff. The court grants the defendant's motion and vacates the default and default judgment. The defendant is ordered to file his proposed answer forthwith.
