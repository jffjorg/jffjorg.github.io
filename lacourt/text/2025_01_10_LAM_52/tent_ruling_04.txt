 Case Number:  24STCV15043    Hearing Date:   January 10, 2025    Dept:  52 Demurrers by Defendants Pedro Jacobo
Villanueva, Henry Magana Villanueva, and H Metals Trucking
Defendants Pedro
Jacobo Villanueva, Henry Magana Villanueva, and H Metals Trucking each demur to
the complaint by plaintiffs Shileeta Latoya Diaz and Antonio Jason Diaz.  
Plaintiffs did not
oppose these demurrers.  Instead, plaintiffs
submitted their attorney’s affidavit fault under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b) and sought leave to file a first amended
complaint.  Relief under that provision
may have been unnecessary.  Code of Civil
Procedure section 472, subdivision (a) provides, “A party may amend its
pleading once without leave of the court … after a demurrer or motion to strike
is filed but before the demurrer or motion to strike is heard if the amended
pleading is filed and served no later than the date for filing an opposition to
the demurrer or motion to strike.”  Plaintiffs
filed and served the affidavits of fault on December 23, 2024, before the
deadline to oppose the demurrers.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b) [9 court days before hearing].)  Plaintiffs could have instead filed a first
amended complaint.  The court will
sustain the demurrers with leave to amend.
Defendants Pedro
Jacobo Villanueva, Henry Magana Villanueva, and H Metals Trucking’s demurrers
to plaintiffs’ complaint are sustained with leave to amend.  Plaintiffs Shileeta Latoya Diaz and Antonio
Jason Diaz shall file a first amended complaint within 20 days.
