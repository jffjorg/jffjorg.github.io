  Case Number:  23STCV26243    Hearing Date:   January 10, 2025    Dept:  52 Defendant Yosef Shalom –
Creative Remodeling #1’s Motion to Set Aside Default and Vacate Any Default
Judgment
            Defendant
Yosef Shalom, sued as “Yosef Shalom – Creative Remodeling #1”, moves to set
aside his default.  
Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) provides,
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her
legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.”  “Because the law
favors disposing of cases on their merits, ‘any doubts in applying section 473
must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default.’
”  (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994)
8 Cal.4th 975, 980.)                   
Defendant Yosef Shalom shows his default resulted
from mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  Defendant’s counsel states she accidentally
“calendared the response date … for the wrong year.”  (Levy Decl., ¶ 8.)  She states, “As a result I did not realize
the date was miscalendared and I did not timely follow up with Plaintiff.”  (Ibid.)  Defendant’s counsel made a simple, excusable
mistake.  Vacating defendant’s default
and the default judgment serves the interests of justice.
Defendant Yosef Shalom’s motion to set aside default
and vacate default judgment is granted.  The court
hereby vacates defendant Yosef Shalom’s defaulted entered on May 29, 2024, and
sets aside the default judgment entered on August 21, 2024.  Defendant shall file his proposed answer
(attached as Exhibit A to the declaration of Efrat Levy) forthwith.
