And here is a summary in English text:

In a tentative ruling, the judge sustains the demurrers filed by defendants Pedro Jacobo Villanueva, Henry Magana Villanueva, and H Metals Trucking against the complaint filed by plaintiffs Shileeta Latoya Diaz and Antonio Jason Diaz. The defendants had demurred to the complaint, and the plaintiffs did not oppose the demurrers. Instead, the plaintiffs filed and served an attorney's affidavit of fault under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) and sought leave to file a first amended complaint. However, the court notes that relief under this provision may have been unnecessary, as the plaintiffs could have filed a first amended complaint. The court grants leave to amend and orders the plaintiffs to file a first amended complaint within 20 days.
