 Case Number:  24STCV09959    Hearing Date:   January 10, 2025    Dept:  52 Defendants’ Motion for
Attorney Fees and Costs
Defendants Will Abbott, Alexey
Mikhaylov, Thomas Rini, 4E Capital LP, and Pharm Capital, LLC move for $210,779.20 in attorney fees and
costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c).  In determining what constitutes a
reasonable fee, the court ordinarily begins with the lodestar, that is, “the
number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.”
(PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22
Cal.4th 1084, 1095 (PLCM).)  The court may rely on its own experience and
knowledge in determining the reasonable value of attorney fees.  (Id. at p. 1096; accord Taylor v.
Nabors Drilling USA, LP (2014) 222 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1249.)
Evidentiary
Objections       
            Plaintiffs Meridian Capital LLC, M2
Growth Partners IV, LLC, OBM PDG, LLC, Wilmington Investors, LLC, Omar
Mangalji, David Mehlman, and Michael Steinberg make 21 objections to the
declaration of Christopher D. Beatty and 10 objections to the declaration of
Keith M. Maziarek.  All objections are overruled.
   
The
moving defendants make 16 evidentiary objections.  All objections are overruled.
Number of Hours
            The
court will reduce the number of hours in defendants’ lodestar.  In calculating the lodestar, the court must
determine whether the tasks performed by an attorney were necessary and whether
the amount of time billed for each task was reasonable.  (Baxter
v. Bock (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 775, 793.) 

            Defendants
cannot recover the 43.7 hours they billed for their demurrer.  “A prevailing defendant on an anti-SLAPP motion is entitled to seek
fees and costs ‘ “incurred in connection with” ’ the anti-SLAPP motion itself,
but is not entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs incurred for the entire
action.”  (569 East County Boulevard
LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426,
433.)  The award “includes attorney fees
incurred to litigate the special motion to strike (the merits fees) plus the
fees incurred in connection with litigating the fee award itself (the fees on
fees).”  (Ibid.)  “The defendant may recover fees and costs
only for the motion to strike, not the entire litigation.”  (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor
(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1320.)    
            Defendants
contend the fees incurred on the demurrer are compensable because they were
inextricably intertwined with the anti-SLAPP motion.  (See Kearney v. Foley and Lardner (S.D. Cal. 2008) 553
F.Supp.2d 1178, 1183-1184.)  The court
finds the demurrer and anti-SLAPP motion were not inextricably
intertwined.  The fact that defendants
identified 43.7 hours of work attributed solely to the demurrer illustrates it
was not intertwined with the anti-SLAPP motion. 
And to the extent the two motions were intertwined, it was unreasonable
and highly inefficient to spend 43.7 hours on the demurrer.  The court will exclude these 43.7 hours from
defendants’ lodestar.
Defendants also billed
excessive hours for this motion for attorney fees.  They billed 21.5 hours for the fee motion and
claim another 11 hours for the reply brief and hearing.  (Beatty Decl., ¶¶ 23.e-27.)  Fee motions are generally rather
straightforward.  This fee motion is not
so complex as to merit 32.5 hours of work. 
It should not have taken more than 22 hours of work, representing 67.8%
of the time defendants claimed.
Defendants reasonably incurred
all 129.4 hours of fees on the anti-SLAPP motion.  (Beatty Decl., ¶ 24.)  The motion had high stakes.  Plaintiffs asserted novel legal
theories.  Defendants’ counsel achieved a
total victory and performed good work to accomplish it.  They also had to thoroughly explain the
collection case, which was fundamental to the anti-SLAPP motion.  The court further notes defendants exercised
billing judgment (see Syers Properties III, Inc. v. Rankin (2014) 226
Cal.App.4th 691, 700) by excluding several entries.  (Beatty Decl., ¶ 30.) 
Hourly Rates
            Defendants’
counsel’s rates are excessive.  “The reasonable hourly
rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.”  (PLCM, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1095.) 
For hourly rates, “the trial court is in the best position to value the
services rendered by the attorneys.” (569
East County Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc. (2016)
6 Cal.App.5th 426, 436.)  The court
should consider many factors, including the nature and difficulty of the
litigation, the stakes involved, the skill required and employed by the
attorney in handling the case, the attorney’s age, experience, and learning,
the success or failure of the litigation, and other relevant
circumstances.  (Id. at p. 1096; Contractors
Labor Pool, Inc. v. Westway Contractors, Inc. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 152,
168.)  
            Each attorney for defendants billed
at an unreasonable hourly rate.  Chris
Beatty billed at $1,420 hourly.  Though
he has some impressive credentials, he has only practiced law in California
since 2009.  (Beatty Decl., ¶ 15.)  Murad Salim bills $990 hourly.  Salim began practicing law in 2017 and was
admitted to the State Bar of California in 2021.  (Id., ¶ 16.)  Ashley T. Brines also bills $990 hourly.  She has practiced law in California since
2018.  (Id., ¶ 17.)  Sarah J. Lee bills $885 hourly but has only
practiced law since 2021.  (Id., ¶
18.)  Finally, Reid R. Gordon bills $725
hourly but has only practiced law since 2022. 
(Id., ¶ 19.)  The court
finds that, based on each attorney’s credentials and experience, each attorney’s
reasonable market rate is 30 percent lower than the rate charged.  The court will therefore reduce the entire
lodestar by 30 percent.
Reduced Lodestar
            Based
on the reductions discussed above, the court calculates the lodestar as
follows: ($129,591 [anti-SLAPP motion] + $37,165 [fee motion] x 67.8% [reduced
hours on fee motion only]) x 70% [hourly rate reduction] = $108,352.21.  Defendants’ motion also claims $2,426.20 in
costs other than attorney fees, as stated in their memorandum of costs.  Plaintiffs did not challenge these expenses.  Defendants therefore will recover a total of
$110,778.41 in attorney fees and other expenses from plaintiffs.     
Disposition

LP, and Pharm Capital, LLC’s motion for attorney fees and costs is granted
