 Case Number:  24STCV11406    Hearing Date:   January 10, 2025    Dept:  52 Plaintiff Mustache Productions,
Inc.’s Motion for Nunc Pro Tunc Order Correcting Complaint Filing Date
Plaintiff Mustache Productions, Inc.
moves for a nunc pro tunc order correcting the filing date of the complaint to
May 6, 2024, instead of May 7.  Courts
may issue such an order when the clerk improperly rejects a filing.  (Rojas v. Cutsforth (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 774, 776-778.)  “[A] paper is
deemed filed when it is deposited with the clerk with directions to file the
paper.”  (Id. at p. 778.)  “The functions of the clerk are purely
ministerial.  [Citation.]  The clerk has no discretion to reject a
complaint that substantially conforms to the local rules.”  (Id. at p. 777; accord Mito v.
Temple Recycling Center Corp. (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 276, 279-281.)
Plaintiff shows it deposited the
complaint with the clerk on May 6, 2024, but the clerk improperly rejected it.  At 4:00 p.m. that day, plaintiff submitted
the summons, complaint, and civil case cover sheet to an electronic filing and
service provider, One Legal. 
(Villalpando Decl., ¶¶ 2-3, Ex. 1.) 
The clerk issued a “notice of court rejection of electronic filing”,
which stated the court received the papers at 4:01 p.m. on May 6.  (Id., Ex. 2.)  The notice states the filing was rejected
because it had the “incorrect court district/court location.”  (Ibid.)  Plaintiff checked the wrong box to identify
the reason for assignment to the Central District on the Civil Case Cover Sheet
Addendum and Statement of Location.  (Villalpando
Decl., ¶¶ 5-6, Ex. 3, p. 7.)  That
mistake did not permit the clerk to reject filing the complaint.  The complaint must be deemed filed on May 6,
2024.
Plaintiff Mustache Productions, Inc.’s
motion for a nunc pro tunc order correcting the filing date of the complaint to
May 6, 2024, is granted.  
The court hereby
orders, nunc pro tunc, that plaintiff’s complaint
shall be deemed filed on May 6, 2024.  The
clerk is directed to correct the filing date on the complaint and in the
court’s other records.
