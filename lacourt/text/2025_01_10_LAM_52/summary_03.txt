And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Plaintiff Mustache Productions, Inc.'s motion for a nunc pro tunc order correcting the filing date of the complaint. The complaint was originally filed on May 7, 2024, but the clerk improperly rejected it. The judge concludes that the complaint was actually filed on May 6, 2024, when it was deposited with the clerk, and that the clerk's rejection was improper. The judge relies on case law to support this conclusion, citing Rojas v. Cutsforth (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 774, 776-778 and Mito v. Temple Recycling Center Corp. (2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 276, 279-281. The judge orders that the complaint shall be deemed filed on May 6, 2024, and directs the clerk to correct the filing date on the complaint and in the court's other records.
