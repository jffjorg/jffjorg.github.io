And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the motion for summary adjudication filed by Robert J. Wood, as the declaration submitted in support of the motion does not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure Section 2015.5. Specifically, the declaration was not signed in Wood's own hand, and it does not state where it was executed. The judge notes that the declaration was executed in a typewritten format with an electronic signature, which is not permissible under Section 2015.5. The judge also finds that the other evidence submitted by Wood in support of his motion did not satisfy his burden of demonstrating that there are no disputed issues of material fact as to the causes of action on which he seeks summary adjudication.
