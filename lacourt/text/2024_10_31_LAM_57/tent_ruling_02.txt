 Case Number:  23STCV36317    Hearing Date:   October 31, 2024    Dept:  57 Pending
before the Court is the motion of Plaintiff Robert J. Wood (“Wood”) for summary
adjudication on the first three causes of action in his First Amended Complaint
against Defendant Gerald Marcus, the personal representative of the estate of
Alexandra Menchacha (“Marcus”).  The
Court is denying Wood’s motion because the declaration of Wood on which the
motion rests does and to which Marcus objected does not comply with the requirements
of Code of Civil Procedure Section 2015.5.
Subject
to exceptions that are inapplicable here, Section 2015.5 prescribes the form of
the certification that must accompany any affidavit or declaration that
California law permits to be filed as support for any matter.  California law permits a party moving for
summary judgment or summary adjudication to submit affidavits or declarations
in support of the motion  (Section
437c(b)(1).)  Thus, Section 2015.5
applies to such affidavits or declarations. 
(Kulshrestha v. First Union Commercial Corp. (2004) 33 Cal.4th
601, 612 [“Kulshrestha”].)  
Section
2015.5 states that an unsworn affidavit or declaration is acceptable, provided
that the affiant of declarant certifies or declares in writing that that
affidavit or declaration is “true under penalty of perjury, is subscribed by
him or her, and (1) if executed within [California], states the date and place
of execution, or (2) if executed at any place, within or without [California],
states the date of execution and that it is so certified or declared under the
laws of the State of California.”  The
requirement in Section 2015.5 that the affidavit or declaration be “subscribed”
by the affiant or declarant “means to sign with one’s own hand.”  (Stockinger v. Feather River Community
College (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1014, 1026.) 
In turn, the subscription requirement means that the affiant or declarant’s
attorney cannot sign the affidavit or declaration on behalf of the affiant or
declarant, even if the affiant or declarant authorizes the attorney to do that.  (In re Marriage of Reese & Guy
(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1222-1223.)   Section 2015.5 was adopted to enable affiants
and declarants to bypass the “cumbersome” process of obtaining a notary public
to administer an oath to the affiant or declarant.  (Kulshrestha, supra, 33 Cal.4th
at 609.)  An affidavit or declaration
that meets the Section 2015.5 specifications is treated the same as one that is
“administered under oath.” (Id. at p. 610.)  The Court can, however, disregard a
declaration or affidavit that does not meet those specifications.  (Id. at p. 612 [trial court properly
excluded from consideration in disposing of a summary judgment motion the
plaintiff’s declaration because it failed to comply with Section 2015.5]; see
also Baron v. More (1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 304, 308; Truslow v. Woodruff
(1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 158, 163-164.)
Here, Wood’s
motion for summary adjudication rests largely on a supporting typewritten declaration
dated August 15, 2024 that contains Wood’s electronic signature in the
following form: 
/s/ Robert J. Wood
                             Robert J. Wood
The
Court will refer to this typewritten declaration as the “August 15 Declaration.”
  Wood also submitted in support of his motion
a handwritten declaration, dated August 1, 2024, that he executed in his own hand
at the state prison where he is incarcerated and that states “I Robert Wood authorize
my attorney Jeff Price to affix my signature to a declaration for filing with
the Court [in this action] after said declaration has been read to me in its
entirety.”  The Court will refer to this
handwritten declaration as the “August 1, Declaration.”
The
August 15 Declaration is defective under Section 2015.5 in the following respects.  
First,
the August 15 Declaration was not subscribed by Wood in his own hand  It has what purports to be Wood’s electronic
signature, which presumably was entered by Wood’s attorney Jeff Price
consistent with Wood’s authorization in the August 1 Declaration for Price to
affix his signature to a future declaration (i.e, the declaration that became
the August 15 Declaration) .  Price’s act
of affixing Wood’s electronic signature on the August 15 Declaration, even if
authorized by Wood, is not permissible under Section 2015.5’s subscription requirement.  Marcus objected to the August 15 Declaration
on this ground.  The Court is sustaining
that objection.
Second,
the August 15 Declaration does not state where it was executed. If it was
executed in California, then the Declaration needed to state, in order to comply
with Section 2015.5, where in California it was executed.  The August 15 Declaration does not comply with
that requirement.  Alternatively, the
August 15 Declaration would have complied with Section 2015.5 if it stated that
it was certified or declared under the laws of California.  The August 15 Declaration does not comply
with that requirement either.
Because
the August 15 Declaration does not comply with the specifications of Section
2015.5, the Court is disregarding it for purposes of considering Wood’s motion
for summary adjudication.  The other
evidence that Wood submitted in support of his motion was excerpts from the transcript
of the deposition of Ashley Broda and a declaration from Broda.  In the Court’s view, this evidence did not satisfy
Wood’s burden of demonstrating under Section 437c(f) that there are no disputed
issues of material fact as to the causes of action on which Wood seeks summary adjudication
so as to indicate that Wood is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on those
causes of action and thereby shift the burden to Marcus to show the presence of
disputed issues of material fact.  (See  Duffey v. Tender Heart Home Care Agency,
LLC (2019) 31 Cal.App.5th 232, 240–241 [discussing initial burden and burden
shifting in connection with motions for summary adjudication;     Cornell
v. Berkeley Tennis Club (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 908, 924-925 [same].)
