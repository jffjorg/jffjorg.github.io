SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
April 4, 2022, Plaintiffs Betty Chen entered into a written contract with defendant
V-Stream Aviation Corp. for a one-way private jet aircraft charter from Maui
Hawaii to Van Nuys California. The flight date was scheduled for April 15, 2022
at a cost of $47,600. Plaintiff Becky Yue was an intended co-passenger. 
 
On
April 8, 2022 Chen cancelled the charger via email “due to covid-19 exposure”
with a confirmed positive test result. Chen subsequently requested a refund
based on the language in the agreement allowing for a “no charge” refund for
cancellations “at least 100 hours in advance of scheduled departure.” Registered
agent for V-Stream, Eli Levy, purportedly confirmed the refund in June and July
2022, but no refund appeared. 
 
On
June 15, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their complain for Breach of Contract and
Conversion. On October 6, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint
for Breach of Contract, Conversion, and Intentional Misrepresentation. On
December 22, 2023, the court granted a motion to strike the claims for punitive
damages and attorney fees. On January 22, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their second
amended complaint for Breach of Contract, Conversion, and Intentional
Misrepresentation
 
RULING: Granted in
Part/Denied in Part.
Defendant V-Stream Aviation
Corp. (V-Stream) moves to compel further responses to request admissions (set
one) numbers 3, 10 and 11 from Plaintiff Betty Chen. The requests seek the
following admissions: “Admit that YOU read the CONTRACT before signing it,”
“Admit that YOU (Betty Chen) did not pay Defendant the $47,600.00 for the one
way flight to Hawaii,” and “Admit that YOU were not going to be a passenger on
the one way flight to Hawaii.” Plaintiff submitted general and specific
objections, including “vague, ambiguous and uncertain,” with conditional
responses, including an admission to reading the contract before signing it,
admitting that co-Plaintiff Becky Yue in fact paid the $47,600, and an
admission that Chen “did not necessarily intend to be a passenger on one or
more of the flight[s] for which payment was made to Defendant.” V-Stream
maintains the responses are non-code compliant in that Plaintiff fails to
provide a straight-forward response. Plaintiff in opposition challenges the
format of the separate statement without any address of the substantive
arguments. The court electronic filing system shows no reply on file at the
time of the tentative ruling publication cutoff.
 
The court declines to consider the challenges solely based
on the separate statement, and finds the argument sufficiently articulated. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (b)(2).)
 
The vague, ambiguous and uncertain for of question
objections also lack merit. Defendants may not intentionally misconstrue a work
for obstreperous purposes. “Indeed,
where the question is somewhat ambiguous, but the nature of the information
sought is apparent, the proper solution is to provide an appropriate response.”
(Deyo v.
Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771,
783 superseded by statute on unrelated ground as stated in Guzman v. General Motors Corp. (1984)
154 Cal.App.3d 438, 444.) 
 
The response to
number three (3) technically fails to constitute code-compliant answers. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.220.) Plaintiff
needs to provide factually consistent information with the “admit” or “deny”
response. If Plaintiff read the contract, then an “admit” response with a
factual follow-up admitting to reading the contract before signing eliminates
the factual incongruity. response. 
 
Numbers 10 and
11, however, both constitute admissions with an explanation regarding the
paying party, and lack of intention to join the charter flight. The responses
are therefore code compliant.
 
The motion is
therefore granted as to number 3 and denied as to numbers 10 and 11. Plaintiff
to serve a revised response to number 3 within 10 days of this order in
compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.290, subdivision (a).) 
 
Defendant requests sanctions, but only prevailed on one of
the three items, while Plaintiff provided no counter request, though could have
also made a request. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (d).) The court finds
no basis for the imposition of sanctions given the offsetting results in the
ruling.
 
Trial remains set for November 12, 2024.

Misrepresentation RULING: Granted.Defendant V-Stream Aviation
Corp. (V-Stream) moves to compel further responses to form interrogatories (set
one) numbers 17.1, 50.1 and 50.2 from Plaintiffs Betty Chen and Becky Yue. The
court consolidates the motions into a single ruling. Plaintiffs submitted general and specific objections,
including “vague, ambiguous, overbroad and burdensome,” as well as “legal
conclusions, attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine” to numbers
17.1 and 50.1. Notwithstanding, Plaintiffs follow-up with reference the “first
amended complaint” and documents potentially in the possession of third party “Pegasus.”
On number 50.2, Plaintiffs respond with “yes,” and refer to the same items as
the prior two responses. Defendant maintains the responses fail to specifically
address the sub-parts. Plaintiff in opposition first challenges the format of
the separate statement, contends the motion lacks a legal or factual basis
compelling further responses, then maintains the responses are factually
sufficient and code compliant. The court electronic filing system shows no
reply on file at the time of the tentative ruling publication cutoff. The court declines to consider the challenges solely based
on the separate statement, and finds the argument sufficiently articulated. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b)(2).) The vague, ambiguous and uncertain for of question
objections also lack merit. Defendants may not intentionally misconstrue a work
for obstreperous purposes. “Indeed,
where the question is somewhat ambiguous, but the nature of the information
sought is apparent, the proper solution is to provide an appropriate response.”
(Deyo v.
Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771,
783 superseded by statute on unrelated ground as stated in Guzman v. General Motors Corp. (1984)
154 Cal.App.3d 438, 444.)   On
the overbroad objections, the court finds no support, especially in response to
form interrogatories in response to a complaint brought by responding parties.
“When discovery requests are grossly overbroad on
their face, and hence do not appear reasonably related to a legitimate
discovery need, a reasonable inference can be drawn of an intent to harass and
improperly burden. When a judge evaluates such factors to determine whether a
party has acted reasonably and in good faith in attempting informal resolution,
a factual component of decision, derived from the trial judge's knowledge of
the case, is inevitably involved.” (Obregon v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.)  On the burdensome and harassing objections, objecting
parties must file evidence detailing the amount of work involved, in order to
support objections based upon burden and oppression. (West Pico Furniture
Co. v. Sup. Ct. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 417.) “[S]ome burden is
inherent in all demands for discovery. The objection of burden is valid only
when that burden is demonstrated to result in injustice.” (Id. at p. 418.) The opposition
lacks support. Again, the items involves response to form
interrogatories in response to a complaint brought by responding parties. The attorney-client privilege attaches to a confidential
communication between the attorney and the client and bars discovery of the
communication irrespective of whether it includes unprivileged material.” (Costco Wholesale
Corp. v. Superior Court (2009) 47 Cal.4th 725, 734.) The transmission
of information between third parties and counsel also maintain attorney client
privilege protection, if the communication is in further interest of the
client. (Evid. Code, § 952.) “Once that party establishes facts necessary to
support a prima facie claim of privilege, the communication is presumed to have
been made in confidence and the opponent of the claim of privilege has the
burden of proof to establish the communication was not confidential or that the
privilege does not for other reasons apply.” (Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Superior Court, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 733.)  The work product privilege applies where the sought after
documents contains Defendant’s “impressions, conclusions, opinions or legal
research or theories,” the information is protected by the work product
doctrine. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2018.030(c).) “An
objecting party may be entitled to protection if it can make a preliminary or
foundational showing that answering the interrogatory would reveal the
attorney's tactics, impressions, or evaluation of the case, or would result in
opposing counsel taking undue advantage of the attorney's industry or
efforts”].) (Coito v.
Superior Court (2012) 54 Cal.4th
480, 502.) Notes, statements, and impressions of the case are protected
by the work product doctrine. A list of potential witnesses is not work
product. (Id. at p. 495; Nacht & Lewis Architects, Inc. v.
Superior Court (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 214, 217–218.) Neither of the subject objections present any basis of
support. The court declines to consider any “legal conclusion” objections as
well due to lack of support.  “Answers must be
complete and responsive. Thus, it is not proper to answer by stating, ‘See my
deposition’, ‘See my pleading’, or ‘See the financial statement’. Indeed, if a
question does require the responding party to make reference to a pleading or
document, the pleading or document should be identified and summarized so the
answer is fully responsive to the question.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 783–784.) The responses to previously produced documents and/or
extrinsic references are improper.  The remainder of the responses are
otherwise incomplete. (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 2030.210-2030.220.)  The court therefore orders supplemental responses to the
form interrogatories 17.1, 50.1 and 50.2, from both plaintiffs Becky Yue and
Betty Chen within 10 days of this order.  Sanctions of $500 ($250 per motion) imposed ($250 per
plaintiff) joint and several with counsel for Plaintiffs. Payable within 30
days. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (d).) Trial remains set for November 12, 2024. Moving party to provide notice.
