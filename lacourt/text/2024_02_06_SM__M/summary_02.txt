And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the defendant's motion to bifurcate the trial of the probable cause element of the plaintiff's malicious prosecution cause of action. The defendant argues that the issue of probable cause is purely a question of law that can be resolved based on stipulated facts and legal argument. However, the judge finds that the issue of probable cause is not solely a question of law, but also involves factual questions that must be resolved by a jury. The judge notes that the plaintiff has submitted sufficient circumstantial evidence indicating that the defendant lacked probable cause to continue prosecuting the unlawful detainer (UD) action, and that the defendant's good faith, subjective belief in the truth of the facts on which the underlying action was based is a factual question that must be determined by a jury. The judge concludes that bifurcation is not proper in this case and that the trial will proceed as scheduled.
