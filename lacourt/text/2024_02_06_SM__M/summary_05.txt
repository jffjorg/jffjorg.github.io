Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, City of Santa Monica, has moved for summary judgment and summary adjudication in this negligence action. The plaintiff, Magdalena Monterroso, seeks damages for injuries sustained in a motor vehicle collision. The defendant argues that the plaintiff did not file the lawsuit within the six-month statute of limitations following the service of the notice of claim rejection. The defendant relies on the declaration of City Risk Management Adjuster Michael Mack, which states that the notice of rejection was mailed to the plaintiff's counsel on October 15, 2021. The defendant asserts that the six-month clock began to run on October 15, 2021, and the plaintiff had to file the lawsuit within 182 days, which is on or before April 15, 2022. The plaintiff did not file the lawsuit until March 23, 2023, and therefore, the action is untimely. The Court finds that the defendant has met its initial burden on summary judgment and that the plaintiff has not presented any triable issues of fact in opposition. The Court grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
