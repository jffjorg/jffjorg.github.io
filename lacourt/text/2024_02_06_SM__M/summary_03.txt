And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, UHC of California, et al., have filed a motion to continue the trial and related dates due to the recent addition of Optum as a defendant. The parties had previously stipulated to a trial continuance, but that stipulation was denied due to the lengthy continuance requested. The court finds good cause for Optum to have a trial continuance, as it needs time to take discovery and pursue summary judgment, if warranted, before trial. The motion is granted, and the matter will be continued to approximately March 2025. The court will discuss a convenient date with the parties at the hearing.
