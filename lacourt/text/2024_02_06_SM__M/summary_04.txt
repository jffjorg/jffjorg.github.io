And here is a summary in English text:

This is the Judge's tentative ruling on a motion to demurrer to the second amended complaint. The Plaintiff, Juan Gabriel Casio Togel, alleges that the Defendant, BDO USA, PC, invaded his privacy and violated California laws. The Judge sustains the demurrer as to all five causes of action without leave to amend.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's allegations of invasion of privacy are insufficient to state a cause of action because he failed to identify any protected privacy interests or reasonable expectations of privacy. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff's causes of action for violation of California Penal Code sections 632, 632.7, and 637 are barred by the statute of limitations.

The Judge further finds that the Plaintiff's cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress is also barred by the statute of limitations. The Judge concludes that the Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a cause of action for invasion of privacy, violation of California Penal Code, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The Judge orders the Defendant to prepare a proposed judgment and sustains the demurrer without leave to amend.
