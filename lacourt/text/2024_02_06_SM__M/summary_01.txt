And here is the English-text summary:

This is the tentative ruling in the case of Sunrise Projects, LLC v. Allstar Financial Services, Inc. et al., case number 21SMCV00756. The case arises from the sale of real property located at 2478 Glyndon Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90291. Defendant/Cross-Defendant Allstar Financial Services, Inc. ("Allstar") sought to sell the property at a non-judicial foreclosure sale, but Plaintiff Sunrise Projects, LLC and Cross-Complainant Alvin Cox each claim to be the highest bidder for the property under the provisions of a recently enacted statutory scheme codified at Civil Code § 2924m.

Allstar moves for summary judgment on the sole cause of action for quiet title asserted against it in Cox's Cross-Complaint in the 21SMCV00756 action. The Court had previously granted Allstar's motion for summary judgment as to Cox's First Amended Complaint in the 21SMCV01011 action, finding that Cox could not claim the benefit of section 2924m because he had not complied with the statutory requirements of section 2924m in tendering his bid to Allstar.

The Court finds that Cox is unable to maintain his claim of quiet title raised in his Cross-Complaint in the 21SMCV00756 action pursuant to the doctrine of collateral estoppel. The Court grants Allstar's motion for summary adjudication and declines to address the remaining arguments raised in Allstar's motion for summary judgment.
