And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the application for default judgment filed by Robindale Villas Condominium Association, Inc. (Plaintiff) against Arlene L. Danganan (Defendant). The Plaintiff is seeking to foreclose an assessment lien and collect delinquent assessment debt, among other things. The Judge has denied the application without prejudice, citing two defects: the proposed order does not provide for a revised judgment, and the attorney fees and costs charged by the Plaintiff's counsel are excessive and duplicate. The Judge requests a revised proposed order on a JUD-100 form and for the Plaintiff's counsel to clarify and modify the attorney fees and costs.
