[Tentative] Order Granting
Applications for Writs of Possession 
 
INTRODUCTION
 
Plaintiff PNC Bank, National Association,
successor to PNC Equipment Finance, LLC (“Plaintiff”) moves for writs of
possession against Defendant PLD & Sons Pallets, Inc. and Urbano Miranda
Ortega (collectively, “Defendants”) over the following property: 2017 Doosan
G25 Forklift, Serial No. FGA0B-1790-05463 (the “Equipment”).  No
oppositions to the applications have been filed by either Defendant.  Because Plaintiff satisfies all statutory
requirements, the writs of possession are granted.      
             
LEGAL STANDARD 
 
“Upon the filing
of the complaint or at any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply pursuant to
this article for a right to attach order and a writ of attachment by filing an
application for the order and writ with the court in which the action is
brought.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 484.010.)  “The Attachment Law statutes are subject to
strict construction.” (Epstein
v. Abrams (1997) 57
Cal.App.4th 1159, 1168.)  
 
“Except as otherwise
provided by statute, an attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim
or claims for money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or
implied, where the total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily
ascertainable amount not less than five hundred dollars ($500) exclusive of
costs, interest, and attorney's fees.” 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 483.010.)  The court shall issue a right to attach order if the court
finds all of the following: 
 
(1)   The claim upon which the attachment is based is one upon
which an attachment may be issued. 
 
(2)   The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
claim upon which the attachment is based. 
 
(3)   The attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the
recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based. 
 
(4)   The amount to be secured by the attachment is greater than
zero.  
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 484.090.)  
 
“A claim has ‘probable
validity’ where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a
judgment against the defendant on that claim.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
481.190.)    “The application
shall be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the facts
presented would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the
attachment is based.” ¿(Code Civ. Proc. § 484.030.)¿“In contested applications,
the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective
parties and make a determination of¿the probable outcome of the
litigation.”¿  (Hobbs v. Weiss (1999)
73 Cal.App.4th 76, 80.)  
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 482.040 states in pertinent part: “The facts stated in each affidavit
filed pursuant to this title shall be set forth with particularity. Except
where matters are specifically permitted by this title to be shown by
information and belief, each affidavit shall show affirmatively that the affiant,
if sworn as a witness, can testify competently to the facts stated therein. As
to matters shown by information and belief, the affidavit shall state the facts
on which the affiant's belief is based, showing the nature of his information
and the reliability of his informant. The affiant may be any person, whether or
not a party to the action, who has knowledge of the facts.”  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
A.        Notice – Plaintiff has provided proper notice.  
 
B.        Probable
Validity of Plaintiff’s Claim – Plaintiff
seeks a writ of possession based on its claims for breach of written agreement
and breach of guaranty.  On or about November
29, 2017, Defendant PLD & Sons Pallets, Inc. entered into a written Loan
and Security Agreement (“Agreement”) for the lease and purchase of the
Equipment from Plaintiff.  (McGinley
Decl. ¶ 5, Exh. 1.)  Plaintiff perfected
its security interest in the Equipment through a California Secretary of State
UCC Financing Statement.  (Id. ¶
6, Exh. 2.)  Defendant Urbano Miranda Ortega
executed a personal guaranty (the “Guaranty”) of the debt obligations in the Loan
Agreement.  (Id. Exh. 1.)  Defendants defaulted on the Loan Agreement
and Guaranty by failing to make payments when due, and there is a balance due
of $12,020.40.  (Id. ¶¶ 11, 23, Exh.
3.)  This establishes that Plaintiff
probably will prevail on the claims.
 
C.        Wrongful
Detention – Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
512.010(b)(2), the application must include “a showing that the property is
wrongfully detained by the defendant, of the manner in which the defendant came
into possession of the property, and, according to the best knowledge,
information, and belief of the plaintiff, of the reason for the detention.”  Under the Loan Agreement, Plaintiff has the
right to repossess the Equipment in the event of default.  (McGinley Decl. Exh. 1.)  Plaintiff has demanded that Defendants
surrender the Equipment.  (Id.
¶ 19.)  Thus, Plaintiff has made a showing that Defendants have
wrongfully detained the Equipment.  
 
D.        Description and Value of Property
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 512.010(b)(3), the application
must include a particular description of the property and a statement of its
value.  Plaintiff
has satisfied this requirement by including a description of the make/model,
the vehicle identification number, and the approximate value.  
 
E.         Statutory Statement
 
Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 512.010(b)(5), Plaintiff must provide a statement
that the property has not been taken for a tax, assessment, or fine, pursuant
to statute and has not been seized under an execution against the Plaintiff’s
property.  Plaintiff has satisfied  this requirement.
 
F.         Location
of the Property
 
Pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 512.010(b)(4), Plaintiff must identify the probable location of the Equipment and establish “probable cause “to
that effect.  (See Code Civ. Proc. §§
512.010(b)(4), 512.080.)  Plaintiff seeks
a writ of possession directing the levying officer to take the Equipment from
real property located at the following two addresses: (1) 8913 Miner Street,
Los Angeles, California 90002; and (2) 225 E. Caldwell Street, No. B, Compton, California
90220. (Appl. ¶ 6.)  Plaintiff has satisfied
that burden with respect to both addresses. 
(See McGinley Decl. ¶ 17 and Exh. 1, Schedule A [Equipment
Location Address of 8913 Miner St.]; see also Proofs of Service filed on July 17, 2024 [showing service on both Defendants at 225 E. Caldwell Street, Compton, California 90220].)  According to the proof of service, “[t]here
is no Unit B” clearly marked at 225 East Caldwell Street in Compton,
California.  Therefore, the court shall
issue the writ of possession for 225 East Caldwell Street, Compton, California
90220.    
 
G.        Undertaking

 
Code of Civil Procedure section 515.010 requires an undertaking to be
filed before the writ issues in the amount of “not less than twice the value of
the defendant’s interest in the property.” 
Section
515.010(a) states that the value of the defendant’s interest “is determined by
the market value of the property less the amount due and owing on any
conditional sales contract or security agreement and all liens and encumbrances
on the property, and any other factors necessary to determine the defendant’s
interest in the property.”
 
Plaintiff submits
evidence that there is a balance due of $12,020.40 on the Loan
Agreement and Guaranty, including $7,361.73 for a “Fixed Purchase Option.”  (McGinley Decl. ¶¶ 11, 23, Exh. 3.)  Plaintiff submits evidence that the Equipment
has a fair market value of approximately $15,000.  (Id. ¶ 22.)  Based on this statement of value, Defendant PLD
& Sons Pallets, Inc., the purchaser, has an interest in the Equipment of approximately
$3,000.  Defendant Urbano Miranda Ortega,
the guarantor, does not have an interest in the Equipment as the Loan Agreement
and Guaranty did not include any purchase option for Ortega individually.  Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
515.010, the court orders Plaintiff to post an undertaking of $6,000 for the
writ of possession against Defendant PLD & Sons Pallets, Inc.   No undertaking is required for the writ of
possession against Defendant Urbano Miranda Ortega.
 
            H.        Turnover Order
 
Plaintiff requests a turnover order. 
(See Proposed Order ¶ 5.g.)  Section 512.070
states: “If a writ of possession is issued, the court may also issue an order
directing the defendant to transfer possession of the property to the
plaintiff. Such order shall contain a notice to the defendant that failure to
turn over possession of such property to plaintiff may subject the defendant to
being held in contempt of court.” 
(emphasis added.) “Thus a ‘turnover’ order, issued pursuant to section 512.070, is not a
separate remedy but rather an alternative means of enforcing a writ of
possession.”  (Edwards v. Superior Court (1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 173, 178.)  Because Plaintiff has satisfied all of the
requirements for writs of possession, the court also issues turnover
orders.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER 
 
Based upon the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
1.         The applications for
writs of possession of the Equipment are granted with respect to the following
addresses: (1) 8913 Miner Street, Los Angeles, California 90002; and (2) 225 E.
Caldwell Street, Compton, CA 90220.
 
            2.         The court issues a turnover order
associated with each writ.
 
3.         The
court orders Plaintiff to post an undertaking in the amount of $6,000 for the
writ of possession against Defendant PLD & Sons Pallets, Inc.   No undertaking is required for the writ of
possession against Defendant Urbano Miranda Ortega.
 
4.         Plaintiff’s counsel shall prepare and
lodge proposed orders.  
 
            5.         Plaintiff’s
counsel shall provide notice and file proof of service with the court.
