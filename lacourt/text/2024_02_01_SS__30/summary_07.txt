And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively granted the defendant's motion to quash service of summons and complaint. The defendant, Jose Ramiro, argues that he was not validly served because the property manager at the apartment complex where service was made does not have any personal knowledge or record of an individual named Jose Ramiro living at the apartment complex, currently or on the date of service. The judge finds that the defendant has submitted sufficient evidence to support his claim, including a declaration from the property manager. The plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the defendant was validly served. Therefore, the motion to quash service of summons and complaint is granted.
