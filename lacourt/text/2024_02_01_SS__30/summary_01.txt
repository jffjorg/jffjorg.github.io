```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion to compel the deposition of the Plaintiff. The Judge has also denied both parties' request for sanctions. The Plaintiff failed to appear for his deposition, despite being properly served with a notice of deposition. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has not properly objected to the deposition notice and has failed to appear for the deposition. As a result, the motion to compel the Plaintiff's deposition is granted. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to appear for deposition within 30 days of the order. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff's request for sanctions is denied because Code of Civil Procedure Section 2025.450(g)(1) only allows for sanctions against the deponent, not the attorney.
