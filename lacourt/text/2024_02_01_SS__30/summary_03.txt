Significant Statements:
  - "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'" (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377)
  - "First, Court notes that whether Plaintiff complied with the Court’s order to pay monetary sanctions is not relevant to the determination of whether terminating sanctions should be imposed."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff, dismissing the plaintiff's complaint with prejudice. The plaintiff has failed to comply with the court's orders to respond to discovery requests and to pay court-ordered sanctions. The court has found that the plaintiff's failure to comply is willful and has a history of discovery abuse, despite numerous attempts to obtain compliance. The court has also found that the plaintiff's failure to comply is detrimental to the defendants' ability to prepare for trial. Therefore, the court has granted the motion for terminating sanctions and dismissed the plaintiff's complaint.
