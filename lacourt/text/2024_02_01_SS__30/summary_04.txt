English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied defendant Arnold Monteagudo's motion for summary adjudication as to the punitive damages claim. The court found that there are triable issues of material fact as to whether defendant's conduct was despicable and carried on with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others. Defendant had admitted to the plaintiffs that he almost crashed into another car due to his inoperable brakes prior to the collision, and continued to drive despite knowing his brakes were inoperable. The court found that this evidence shows defendant's conduct was carried on with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others, and that he was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his conduct because he almost crashed, yet he willfully failed to avoid such consequences by driving again.
