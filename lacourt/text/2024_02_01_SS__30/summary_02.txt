And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's independent medical examination (IME). The plaintiff failed to appear for a previously scheduled IME on October 18, 2023, and has not responded to the defendant's attempts to meet and confer to stipulate to the examination. The judge orders the plaintiff to appear for a new IME on February 28, 2024, at 11:30 a.m. with Orthopedic Surgeon Dr. Jeffrey Korchek.

The judge denies the defendant's request for sanctions, as the plaintiff did not oppose the motion and did not unsuccessfully oppose it. The judge also denies the defendant's request for sanctions under CCP section 2023.010 for the misuse of discovery, citing a previous court decision that these sections do not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.
