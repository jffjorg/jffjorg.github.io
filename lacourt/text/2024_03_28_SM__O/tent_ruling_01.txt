TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendant
Rene R. Rivas and Dora G. Rivas’ Motion to Compel Arbitration is GRANTED.  The Court orders this action stayed pending
resolution of arbitration.  Defendants met their burden to establish the
existence of a valid arbitration agreement. Plaintiffs did not meet their
burden to challenge the existence and enforcement of the valid enforcement
agreement. Enforcement of the arbitration agreement is under the FAA as per
arbitration agreement. Given the Court’s order granting Defendant’s motion to
compel arbitration, Plaintiffs Motion to Consolidate is DENIED as moot. 
 
“The petitioner bears the burden of
proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement by the preponderance of
the evidence, and a party opposing the petition bears the burden of proving by
a preponderance of the evidence any fact necessary to its defense. In these
summary proceedings, the trial court sits as a trier of fact, weighing all the
affidavits, declarations, and other documentary evidence, as well as oral
testimony received at the court's discretion, to reach a final determination.”
(Giuliano v. Inland Empire Personnel, Inc. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1276,
1284.)   “The party opposing arbitration
has the burden of demonstrating that an arbitration clause cannot be
interpreted to require arbitration of the dispute.” (Rice v. Downs
(2016) 247 Cal.App.4th 1213, 1223, citing Coast Plaza Doctors Hospital v.
Blue Cross of California (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 677, 686-87.)   “On petition of a party to an arbitration
agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a
controversy and that a party to the agreement refuses to arbitrate that
controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to
arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the
controversy exists, unless it determines that: (a) The right to compel
arbitration has been waived by the petitioner…” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.)  “A
party opposing the petition bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
evidence any fact necessary to its defense.” (Olvera v. El Pollo Loco, Inc.
(2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 447, 453.) 
 
 
If the court
determines that a party to the arbitration is also a party to litigation in a
pending court action or special proceeding with a third party as set forth
under subdivision (c), the court (1) may refuse to enforce the arbitration
agreement and may order intervention or joinder of all parties in a single
action or special proceeding; (2) may order intervention or joinder as to all
or only certain issues; (3) may order arbitration among the parties who have
agreed to arbitration and stay the pending court action or special proceeding
pending the outcome of the arbitration proceeding; or (4) may stay arbitration
pending the outcome of the court action or special proceeding. 
 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
1281.2.)
 
            Defendants Rene
Rivas and Dora Rivas (“The Rivas Defendants”) move to compel arbitration based
on the Arbitration Agreement within the California Residential Purchase
Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”) entered into between the parties on 6-7-21.
(Rivas Decl., Ex. 1, ¶ 22b.) The Purchase Agreement included an agreement to arbitrate
any dispute or claim arising out of the Purchase Agreement.  The existence of this arbitration agreement
is undisputed. The agreement states:
 
B. ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES: The
Parties agree that any dispute or claim in Law or equity arising
between them out of this Agreement or any resulting transaction, which is
not settled through mediation, shall be decided by neutral, binding
arbitration. The Parties also agree to arbitrate any disputes or claims
with Broker(s), who, in writing, agree to such arbitration prior to, or within
a reasonable time after, the dispute or claim is presented to the Broker. The
arbitrator shall be a retired judge or justice, or an attorney with at least 5
years of residential real estate Law experience, unless the parties mutually
agree to a different arbitrator. The Parties shall have the right to discovery
in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure §1283.05. In all other respects, the
arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with Title 9 of Part 3 of the Code
of Civil Procedure. Judgment upon the award of the arbitrator(s) may be entered
into any court having jurisdiction. Enforcement of this agreement to
arbitrate shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Exclusions from
this arbitration agreement are specified in paragraph 22C. 
 
"NOTICE: BY INITIALING IN THE
SPACE BELOW YOU ARE AGREEING TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF THE MATTERS
INCLUDED IN THE 'ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES' PROVISION DECIDED BY NEUTRAL
ARBITRATION AS PROVIDED BY CALIFORNIA LAW AND YOU ARE GIVING UP ANY RIGHTS YOU

INITIALING IN THE SPACE BELOW YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR JUDICIAL RIGHTS TO
DISCOVERY AND APPEAL, UNLESS THOSE RIGHTS ARE SPECIFICALLY INCLUDED IN THE
'ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES' PROVISION. IF YOU REFUSE TO SUBMIT TO ARBITRATION
AFTER AGREEING TO THIS PROVISION, YOU MAY BE COMPELLED TO ARBITRATE UNDER THE
AUTHORITY OF THE CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE. YOUR AGREEMENT TO THIS
ARBITRATION PROVISION IS VOLUNTARY."
 
"WE HAVE READ ANO UNDERSTAND THE
FOREGOING AND AGREE TO SUBMIT DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF THE MATTERS INCLUDED IN
THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES' PROVISION TO NEUTRAL ARBITRATION."
 
(Rivas Decl., ¶ 1, Ex. 1 at ¶22B,
emphasis added.)
 
            It is undisputed the Plaintiffs’
claims in this action against the Rivas Defendants arise out of the Purchase
Agreement “or any resulting transaction.”
 
            Plaintiffs
argue the California Arbitration Act (“CAA” - Code of Civil Procedure, §§
1280–1294.2), and not the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), should govern the
enforcement of the arbitration agreement. Plaintiffs argue CCP § 1281.2(c)
applies because the Purchase Agreement adopts California Law. (Oppo., pp. 6–7;
Motion to Consolidate, pp. 7–8.)  Further,
Plaintiffs argue there are third parties involved in the real estate
transaction that are not signatories to the arbitration agreement.  Therefore, Plaintiff’s argue the Court can
and should deny the motion to compel arbitration under CCP 1281.2(c) because there
is a “possibility of conflicting rulings on common issues of law or fact should
the matter proceed to arbitration.” (Oppo, p. 6)  In their opposition, Plaintiffs do not raise
any challenge to the enforcement of the arbitration agreement.      
            
            However, in
their Reply Memorandum filed in support of Plaintiff’s motion to consolidate this
action with another pending arbitration proceeding, Plaintiffs argue, without
any evidence, that the Rivas Defendants “waived” their rights to arbitration.  The Court sustains the Rivas Defendants’ objection
to this new matter raised for the first time in their Reply Memorandum.    
 
            The Rivas
Defendants argue that the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) applies to the
enforcement of the arbitration agreement because it expressly states  “[E]nforcement of this agreement to
arbitrate shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.” The Rivas
Defendants show the resolution of this issue is governed by  the holding of Victrola 89, LLC v. Jaman
Props. 8 LLC (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 337, 346. There, the Court held that
under the exact same circumstances and with identical arbitration agreement language
as at issue in this case, “when an agreement provides that its
“enforcement” shall be governed by the FAA, the FAA governs a party's motion to
compel arbitration.”  Thus, the
Rivas Defendants argue the FAA preempts the application of CCP § 1281(c) and
the Motion to Compel Arbitration must therefore be granted.    
 
For the same reasons as in Victoria,
supra, the Court finds the FAA preempts the application of  CCP § 1281(c). 
The Court finds that the FAA governs the enforcement of the Arbitration
Agreement. “The FAA embodies a clear federal policy in favor of arbitration.” (Simula,
Inc. v. Autoliv, Inc. (9th Cir. 1999) 175 F.3d 716, 719.) “The standard for
demonstrating arbitrability is not high . . . . [the] FAA leaves no place for the
exercise of discretion by a district court, but instead mandates that district
courts direct the parties to proceed to arbitration on issues as to which an
arbitration agreement has been signed.” (Ibid.)
 
            The Court
finds that since there is a valid arbitration agreement entered into by the
parties, and the Plaintiffs did not meet their burden to challenge the
agreement, the Motion to Compel Arbitration is GRANTED and orders this action is stayed. pending resolution of arbitration.
