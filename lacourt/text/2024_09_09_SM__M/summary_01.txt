Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion for a protective order, which sought to prevent the defendants from taking a deposition of a third-party expert, Mary Cronin, beyond the discovery cutoff date. The plaintiff argued that the deposition is subject to the discovery cutoff because Cronin is a percipient witness, but the court found that the defendants' designation of Cronin as a non-retained expert witness rendered the deposition exempt from the cutoff. The court noted that the defendants properly served the supplemental expert designation and that the deposition was noticed within the expert witness discovery cut-off period. The court also found that the plaintiff failed to show good cause for the protective order and that the deposition could proceed as noticed within 5 days.
