Code of Civil Procedure section
1987.1 states that “[i]f a subpoena requires the attendance of a witness or the
production of books, documents, electronically stored information, or other
things before a court, or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of
a deposition, the court, upon motion reasonably made by any person described in
subdivision (b), or upon the court’s own motion after giving counsel notice and
an opportunity to be heard, may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely,
modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as
the court shall declare, including protective orders.”  (CCP §
1987.1(a).)  “In addition, the court may make any other order as may be
appropriate to protect the person from unreasonable or oppressive demands,
including unreasonable violations of the right of privacy of the person.” 
(Id.)  
   
Courts have considerable discretion in granting and
crafting protective orders. (Raymond Handling Concepts Corp. v. Superior
Court (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 584, 588.) “The court, for good cause
shown, may make any order that justice requires to protect any party, deponent,
or other natural person or organization from unwarranted annoyance,
embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense.” (CCP §
2025.420(b).) A court may make any order that justice requires to protect a
party from “unwanted annoyance, embarrassment or oppression or undue burden and
expense.”  (CCP, § 2030.090(b).) The court may make any order
that justice requires to protect any party from unwarranted annoyance,
embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense upon a showing of
good cause. (CCP § 2031.060(b).)  
 
The burden of proof is on the party seeking the
protective order to show “good cause” for the order he or she seeks. (Fairmont
Insurance Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.) A motion
for a protective order “shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040.” (CCP, § 2030.090.) “A meet and confer
declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and
good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the
motion.”  (CCP § 2016.040.)   
 
As a general rule, all unprivileged
information that is relevant to the subject matter of the action is
discoverable if it would itself be admissible evidence at trial or if it
appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
(CCP § 2017.010; Schnabel v. Superior Court (1993) 5 Cal.4th 704,
711.) Information is relevant if it might reasonably assist a party in
evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement. (Gonzalez
v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546.)
 
ANALYSIS
 
Plaintiff Eileen Singer moves for a
protective order, protecting her from the “undue burden and expense in having
to attend a fact witness deposition noticed by Defendants beyond the August 16,
2024, discovery cutoff.”  Plaintiff
explains that on August 11, 2024, Defendants served third-party Mary Cronin,
Singer’s 2016 real estate agent, with a subpoena to appear at deposition. Plaintiff
objected to the subpoena on grounds the deposition is beyond the discovery
cutoff and was served without sufficient notice. On August 16, 2024, Defendants
served a supplemental expert designation, designating Cronin as a “non-retained
expert.” Defendants re-noticed Cronin’s deposition for August 28, 2024.
Plaintiff maintains that a non-retained percipient witness, like Cronin, is
still a fact witness subject to the August 16, 2024, discovery cutoff, even if
she was properly designated as an expert.
 
Plaintiff does not notice on which
statutory grounds the motion is made. Plaintiff’s only cited authority is Huntley
v. Foster (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 755, which concerns the distinction between
percipient versus retained experts under a prior version of the discovery
statute. In Huntley, the question was whether the trial court correctly excluded
plaintiffs' treating physicians from testifying as experts at trial, because
plaintiff did not provide a timely expert witness declaration for them. (Id.
at 755-757.) The court reversed, holding that the disclosures were not required
for treating physicians because they are percipient witnesses, not retained
experts, even if they may be presented with questions at trial that call for an
expert opinion. (Id. at 756.) “Because a percipient expert is not given
information by the employing party, but acquires it from personal observation,
the [former] statute treats him or her as a fact witness. Requiring an attorney
to analyze such a witness's anticipated testimony and submit the analysis to
the opponent [required for drafting an expert declaration] would invade the
absolute protection given by the work product doctrine to the thought processes
of an attorney in preparation for trial.” (Hurtado v. Western Med. Ctr
(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1198, 1203.) These principles have limited application to
the case at hand. Plaintiff raises no issue with Defendants’ supplemental
designation of Cronin as a non-retained expert, even if Plaintiff believes that
Cronin will only provide testimony as a percipient witness. 
 
Plaintiff does not argue that
expert depositions cannot go forward at this time. Special cutoffs apply to
expert witnesses. Discovery proceedings pertaining to
expert witnesses designated under section 2034.010 et seq. may be completed until
15 days before trial, and motions concerning such discovery may be heard until 10
days before trial. (CCP § 2024.030.) On August 16, 2024, Defendants served
their Supplemental Designation of Expert Witnesses, designating Ms. Cronin as a
non-retained expert witness. (Earl Decl. ¶ 5.) The date of the noticed
deposition was August 28, 2024, within the expert witness discovery cut-off
period. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion for
a protective order is DENIED. The deposition of Ms. Cronin is ordered to
proceed as noticed within 5 days.
