1.      Margaret
M. Lindsey, et al.’s Demurrer to Complaint 
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
            Margaret M. Lindsey, et al.’s Demurrer to
Complaint is overruled. 
 
            Background
 
            Plaintiff
filed the Complaint on February 1, 2024. Plaintiff alleges the following facts.
This is an unlawful detainer action as to
the following residential property: 512
Evergreen Street, #309, Inglewood, CA 90302. Defendants have failed to vacate the premises after defaulting on their
loan and losing their property to foreclosure.
 
            Demurrer

 
            Delta Imports v. Municipal Court (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 1033, 1036 holds that a motion
to quash service of summons is the proper procedure to test whether a complaint
states a cause of action for unlawful detainer. 
However, other recent cases have held that a demurrer is the appropriate
method to challenge whether a complaint states a valid cause of action for
unlawful detainer.  See Borsuck v. Appellate Division of Superior Court (2015) 242
Cal.App.4th 607, 610.  Here,
Defendants filed and served a demurrer. In any event, whether brought as a
demurrer or motion to quash, the defect in the pleading must appear on the face
of the Complaint.  See Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.
 
            A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law and raises
only questions of law. (Schmidt v. Foundation Health (1995) 35
Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In testing the
sufficiency of the complaint, the court must assume the truth of (1) the
properly pleaded factual allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably inferred
from those expressly pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank v.
Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) 
The Court may not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of
fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe
(1994) 7 Cal.App.4th 634, 638.)  Because
a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint, the plaintiff must show
that the complaint alleges facts sufficient to establish every element of each
cause of action.  (Rakestraw v.
California Physicians Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.)  Where the complaint fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the
demurrer.  (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig
v. County of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
 
            Sufficient
facts are the essential facts of the case "with reasonable precision and
with particularity sufficiently specific to acquaint the defendant with the
nature, source, and extent of his cause of action.”  (Gressley v. Williams (1961) 193
Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.)  "Whether
the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is irrelevant to ruling
upon the demurrer."  (Stevens v.
Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605, 609–610.)  Under Code Civil Procedure § 430.10(f), a
demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is “uncertain.”  Uncertainty exists where a complaint’s
factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently apprise a
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
 
            CCP §
1166 sets forth the pleading requirements of an unlawful detainer
complaint.  CCP 1166(a) states, in
relevant part: “The complaint shall: (1) Be verified and include the typed or
printed name of the person verifying the complaint. (2) Set forth the facts on
which the plaintiff seeks to recover. (3) Describe the premises with reasonable
certainty. (4) If the action is based on paragraph (2) of Section 1161, state
the amount of rent in default. (5) State specifically the method used to serve
the defendant with the notice or notices of termination upon which the
complaint is based.” CCP § 1166(c) states: “In an action regarding residential
real property based on Section 1161a, the plaintiff shall state in the caption
of the complaint “Action based on Code of Civil Procedure Section 1161a.””
 
            Code
Civ. Proc., § 1161a states, in relevant part:
            “(a)
As used in this section:
(1) “Manufactured home” has the same meaning as
provided in Section 18007 of the Health and Safety Code.
(2) “Mobilehome” has the same meaning as provided in
Section 18008 of the Health and Safety Code.
(3) “Floating home” has the same meaning as provided
in subdivision (d) of Section 18075.55 of the Health and Safety Code.
(b) In any of the following cases, a person who holds
over and continues in possession of a manufactured home, mobilehome, floating
home, or real property after a three-day written notice to quit the property
has been served upon the person, or if there is a subtenant in actual
occupation of the premises, also upon such subtenant, as prescribed in Section
1162, may be removed therefrom as prescribed in this chapter:
(1) Where the property has been sold pursuant to a
writ of execution against such person, or a person under whom such person
claims, and the title under the sale has been duly perfected.
(2) Where the property has been sold pursuant to a
writ of sale, upon the foreclosure by proceedings taken as prescribed in this
code of a mortgage, or under an express power of sale contained therein,
executed by such person, or a person under whom such person claims, and the
title under the foreclosure has been duly perfected.
(3) Where the property has been sold in accordance
with Section 2924 of the Civil Code, under a power of sale contained in a deed
of trust executed by such person, or a person under whom such person claims,
and the title under the sale has been duly perfected.
(4) Where the property has been sold by such person,
or a person under whom such person claims, and the title under the sale has
been duly perfected.
(5) Where the property has been sold in accordance
with Section 18037.5 of the Health and Safety Code under the default provisions
of a conditional sale contract or security agreement executed by such person,
or a person under whom such person claims, and the title under the sale has
been duly perfected.”
 
             Defendants demur on the grounds of
failure to state sufficient facts and uncertainty. Essentially, Defendants
argue that the foreclosure sale was not lawful and that they were not properly
served with the 3/30/90-day notice to quit. 
 
            However,
here, Plaintiff has alleged all the essential elements noted above to state a
cause of action for unlawful detainer. Plaintiff attached the notice to quit as
Exhibit 2. Plaintiff attached the proof of service of the notice to quit. Whether
Defendants were or were not served with the 3/30/90-day notice is a question of
fact which is not proper for resolution with a demurrer. 
 
            In
addition, whether the underlying foreclosure sale was or was not lawful,
likewise, constitutes issues of fact which are not appropriate for resolution
with a demurrer. “In an unlawful detainer
action brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1161a, subdivision
(b)(3), the plaintiff must show that he or she acquired the property at a
regularly conducted sale and thereafter “duly perfected” title.”  The Bank of New York Mellon v. Preciado
(2013) 224 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1, 9. Plaintiff has adequately pled such
allegations. (Complaint, ¶ 7.)
 
            Therefore,
Defendants’ demurrer is overruled.
 
            Defendants
are ordered to file an Answer within five days of this date. 
 
            Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
