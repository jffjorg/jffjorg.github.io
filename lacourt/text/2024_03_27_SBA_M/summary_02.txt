And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendants, Margaret M. Lindsey, et al., is overruled. The defendants had argued that the complaint failed to state sufficient facts and was uncertain, but the judge has determined that the plaintiff, Norwest Management, LLC, has adequately pled all the essential elements of an unlawful detainer action. The judge has also determined that whether the defendants were properly served with the notice to quit and whether the foreclosure sale was lawful are questions of fact that are not suitable for resolution with a demurrer. The defendants are ordered to file an answer within five days of this date, and the plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
