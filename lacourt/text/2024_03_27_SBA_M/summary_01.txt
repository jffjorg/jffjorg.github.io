Summary of Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The judge has granted Big Brothers Big Sisters of America's (BBBSA) motion for summary judgment, granting judgment in favor of BBBSA. The judge found that BBBSA had no duty of care to protect the plaintiff from the alleged sexual abuse by Daniel Donohue, a mentor in BBBSA's program. The judge based this decision on the evidence presented, which showed that BBBSA had no control over the day-to-day operations of its affiliates, including BBBSLA, and that the plaintiff's allegations were similar to those presented in the case of Brown v. USA Taekwondo (2021) 11 Cal.5th 204. The judge ruled that there was no competent evidence to show that BBBSA had a special relationship with the plaintiff, and therefore, no duty of care existed on the part of BBBSA.
