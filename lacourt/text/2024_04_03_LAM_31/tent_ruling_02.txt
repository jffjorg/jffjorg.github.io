[1] A failure to oppose a motion may
be deemed a consent to the granting of the motion.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.54(c).)


[2] The court notes that Plaintiff
also argues that the responses to Nos. 1, 2, 4-8, 19, 20, 31, 35, and 39 do not
comply with Section 2031.280 because Quik Tow did not label any of the
documents produced to correspond with the demand.   This argument lacks marit.  Plaintiff relies on an outdated version of
Section 2031.280.  The current version of
Section 2031.280 does not set forth any such “labeling” requirement.
