And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the Third Cause of Action, which alleges disparate treatment and harassment based on age. The judge finds that the pleading style of the complaint is unclear and obfuscates the basis for the disparate treatment claim. The judge directs the plaintiff to specifically allege the factual basis for this and other causes of action. The judge also gives the plaintiff the option to clarify the pleading by setting out the disparate treatment claim as separate causes of action.
