[1] The Sixth Cause of Action is
asserted against all Defendants.  All
other causes of action are asserted against APL only.


[2] Defendants also argue that the
grouping of three separate discrimination claims in the Third Cause of Action
is improper.  “Whether captioned as one
or more causes of action in a complaint, discrimination based on each protected
characteristic is a separate claim under FEHA.  (Soria v. Univision Radio Los Angeles, Inc.
(2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 570, 585, fn. 6.) 
For this reason, Defendants contend that the court should order
Plaintiff to provide a more definite pleading. Citing Hindin v. Rust (2004)
118 Cal.App.4th 1247, Galindo argues, in essence, that the Third Cause of
Action is properly pleaded because he has alleged an invasion of only one
primary right: disparate treatment.  “The
manner in which a plaintiff elects to organize his or her claims within the
body of the complaint is irrelevant to determining the number of causes of
action alleged under the primary right theory.  ‘[I]f a plaintiff states several purported
causes of action which allege an invasion of the same primary right he has
actually stated only one cause of action.’” (Hindin, at p. 1257.)  Galindo may be technically correct but misses
the point.  Here, Galindo’s choice of
pleading style obfuscates the basis for his disparate treatment claim.  A more definite pleading is therefore
necessary.  Given that the court has
sustained the demurrer to the Third Cause of Action based, in substantial part,
on the uncertainty of the allegations, the court directs Plaintiff to
specifically allege the factual basis for this and other causes of action (as
discussed herein).  Galinda may
alternatively clarify the pleading by setting out the disparate treatment claim
as separate causes of action. 


[3] As to harassment based on age,
there are zero allegations of any comments or conduct regarding Galindo’s
age.
