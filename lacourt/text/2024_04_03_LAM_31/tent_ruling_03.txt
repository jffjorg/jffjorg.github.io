MOTION
FOR ENTRY OF JUDGMENT



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Morrison Express Corporation (USA)
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On February 24, 2023, Plaintiff, Morrison Express
Corporation (USA), filed a Complaint against Defendant, MFS Supply, LLC, for (1)
breach of written contract, (2) breach of oral contract, (3) account stated, and
(4) quantum meruit.  As alleged,
Plaintiff’s business includes importing, freight forwarding and logistical services.  Pursuant to a written and oral contract, Plaintiff
provided such services to Defendant. The bill amounted to $80,290.70.  Defendant did not pay the bill. 
 
            On January
26, 2024, the court granted Plaintiff’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.  Plaintiff served Defendant with a notice of ruling
and proposed judgment.
 
            On February
14, 2024, the court issued a minute order stating that the order granting
Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the pleadings did not indicate whether
Defendant would be granted leave to amend. 
Consequently, Defendant had ten days to file any amendment. Because
Defendant did not file an amended pleading, the court directed Plaintiff to
move for entry of judgment in its favor. 

 
            On February
29, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for entry of judgment in the sum of
$102,346.94, consisting of the principal amount due of $80,290.70 as stated in
the Complaint, $13,302.24 in interest, $8,019.00 in attorney fees, and $735.00
for costs of suit.  
 
            Defendant
has not filed an Opposition.[1]
 
II.        JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
            Plaintiff requests judicial notice of (1) the
court’s minute order granting Plaintiff’s Motion for judgment on the Pleadings
(Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) 1), (2) the court’s minute order of February
14, 2024 (RJN 2), and (3) the Notice of Ruling filed and served by Plaintiff on
January 26, 2024 (RJN 3).
 
            The
unopposed request is GRANTED.  (Evid.
Code, § 452, subds. (a), (d).)
 
III.       DISCUSSION & LEGAL STANDARD
            
Plaintiff moves for entry of
judgment in its favor and against Defendant pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
(CCP) section 438.
 
             CCP
section 438 provides that “if the motion [for judgment on the pleadings] is
granted with respect to the entire complaint or answer with leave to file an
amended complaint or answer, as the case may be, but an amended complaint or
answer is not filed, then after the time to file an amended complaint or
answer, as the case may be, has expired, judgment shall be entered forthwith in
favor of the moving party.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (h)(4)(C).) 
CCP section 438 further provides the following: 
 
(i)(1) Where a motion for judgment
on the pleadings is granted with leave to amend, the court shall not enter a
judgment in favor of a party until the following proceedings are had: 
 
(A) If an amended pleading is filed
and the moving party contends that pleading is filed after the time to file an
amended pleading has expired or that pleading is in violation of the court’s
prior ruling on the motion, then that party shall move to strike the pleading
and enter judgment in its favor. 


(B)  If no amended pleading is filed,
then the party shall move for entry of judgment in its favor. 
 
          (2) All motions made pursuant to this
subdivision shall be made pursuant to Section 1010. 
 
          (3) At the hearing on the motion
provided for in this subdivision, the court shall determine         
               whether to enter judgment
in favor of a particular party. 
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 438, subd. (i).) 
 
On January 26, 2024, the court
granted Plaintiff’s motion for judgment on the pleadings. (RJN 1.) The
order did not indicate whether Defendant had leave to amend.  (Id.)  On February 14, 2024, the court issued a
minute order indicating that Defendant had ten days to file an amendment
pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1320(g).  (RJN 2.)  Thus, Defendant had until February 5, 2024 to
file an amended answer.  Despite being served with notice of the January
26, 2024 ruling, Defendant has failed to file an amended answer.  (RJN 3.) 
 
As Defendant has not filed an
amended answer, Plaintiff is entitled to judgment pursuant to CCP section 438,
subdivision (h)(4)(C).)  However, the court cannot enter judgment in the
sum of $102,346.94.  The requested
judgment consists, in part, of $735.00 for costs of suit.  Plaintiff has yet to file a Memorandum of
Costs supporting the costs incurred. 
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
Accordingly,
the motion for entry of judgment is CONTINUED to April 16, 2024 to allow
Plaintiff to file a Memorandum of Costs. 

 
Moving party to give notice. 

 
 
Dated:   April 3, 2024
