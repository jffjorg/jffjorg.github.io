And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge, Kerry Bensinger, issued a tentative ruling in the case of Morrison Express Corporation (USA) v. MFS Supply, LLC. The plaintiff, Morrison Express Corporation, filed a complaint against the defendant, MFS Supply, LLC, for breach of written and oral contract, account stated, and quantum meruit. The plaintiff provided goods and services to the defendant, but the defendant failed to pay the bill. The court granted the plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings, but the order did not indicate whether the defendant had leave to amend. The defendant failed to file an amended answer, so the plaintiff is entitled to judgment. However, the court cannot enter judgment in the sum of $102,346.94 because the plaintiff has not filed a Memorandum of Costs supporting the costs incurred. The motion for entry of judgment is continued to April 16, 2024, to allow the plaintiff to file the Memorandum of Costs.
