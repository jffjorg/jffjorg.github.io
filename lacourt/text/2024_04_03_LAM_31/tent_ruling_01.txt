MOTIONS
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY 



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Fermin Garcia
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
On September 26, 2022, Plaintiff, Fermin Garcia, filed this
action against Defendants, Quik Tow LLC (“Quik Tow”) and Ignacio Gonzalez, for wage
and hour violations.
 
On March 5, 2024, Plaintiff timely filed these motions to
compel further responses to Form Interrogatories (General), Set One, Nos. 12.1,
15.1, and 17.1; Special Interrogatories, Set One, No. 6; and Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. 1, 2, 4-8, 19, 20, 25, 28, 31, 35, and
39.  Plaintiff requests sanctions against
Quik Tow and its counsel.
 
The motions are unopposed.[1]
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
 
            Under Code
of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300 and 2031.310, parties may move for a
further response to interrogatories and requests for production of documents
where an answer to the requests are evasive or incomplete or where an objection
is without merit or too general.¿ A motion to compel further response to
requests for production “shall set forth specific facts showing good cause
justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(1).)¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
Notice of the motions must be given within 45 days of
service of the verified response, otherwise, the propounding party waives any
right to compel a further response.  (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (c); 2031.310, subd. (c).)¿ The motions must
also be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (b)(1);
2031.310, subd. (b)(2).) 
¿¿¿ 
Finally, California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345 requires
that all motions or responses involving further discovery contain a separate
statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of
factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses.¿ (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(a)(3).)¿¿¿ 
 
Monetary Sanctions¿¿ 
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court to
impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which
includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without
substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an
evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial
justification making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿¿ 
 
            If
sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that
the notice specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought
and the type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points
and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the
amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿ 
 
            If the
court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made or opposed a motion to compel
responses to interrogatories or inspection demands, the court “shall impose a
monetary sanction . . . unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c);
2031.310, subd. (h).)¿¿¿  
 
Sanctions against counsel:¿ The court in Kwan
Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81 (Hennings)
noted that discovery sanctions against an attorney are governed by a different
standard than sanctions against a party:¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
By the terms of the statute, a trial court under section
2023.030(a) may not impose monetary sanctions against a party’s attorney unless
the court finds that the attorney “advised” the party to engage in the conduct
resulting in sanctions. (§ 2023.030(a); Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 256, 261, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ “Unlike monetary sanctions
against a party, which are based on the party's misuse of the discovery
process, monetary sanctions against the party's attorney require a finding the
‘attorney advis[ed] that conduct.’ ” (Ibid.) “It is not enough that the
attorney's actions were in some way improper.” (Corns v. Miller (1986)
181 Cal.App.3d 195, 200, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247 (Corns).) Because an
attorney's advice to a client is “peculiarly within [his or her] knowledge,”
the attorney has the burden of showing that he or she did not counsel discovery
abuse. (Ibid.) Accordingly, when a party seeking sanctions against an
attorney offers sufficient evidence of a misuse of the discovery process, the
burden shifts to the attorney to demonstrate that he or she did not recommend
that conduct. (Id. at pp. 200–201, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247; Ghanooni,
at p. 262, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff seeks a further response to Form Interrogatories
(General), Set One, Nos. 12.1, 15.1, and 17.1; Special Interrogatories, Set
One, No. 6; and Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. 1, 2, 4-8,
19, 20, 25, 28, 31, 35, and 39. 
 
            Form
Interrogatory No. 12.1: State the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number
of each individual; (a) who witnessed the INCIDENT or the events occurring
immediately before or after the INCIDENT; (b) who made any statement at the
scene of the INCIDENT; (c) who heard any statements made about the INCIDENT by
any individual at the scene; and (d) who YOU OR ANYONE ACTON ON YOUR BEHALF
claim has knowledge of the INCIDENT (except for expert witnesses covered by
Code of Civil Procedure section 2034).
            
            Quik Tow
responded: “Rocio Rivera – 562-321-3723.” 

 
The court finds Quik Tow’s response to Form Interrogatory
No. 12.1 is incomplete and evasive.  A
further response is warranted.  
 
            Form
Interrogatory No. 15.1: Identify
each denial of a material allegation and each special or affirmative defense in
your pleadings and for each: (a) state all facts upon which you base your
denial or special or affirmative defense; (b) state the name, ADDRESSES, and
telephone numbers of all PERSONS who have knowledge of those facts and; (c)
identify all DOCUMENTS and other tangible things that support your denial or
special or affirmative defense, and state the name of the PERSON who has each
DOCUMENT.
 
            Quik Tow
responded: “(a) General denial of unverified facts. All defenses based in part
or in full upon lack of employee/employer relationship or other exemption from
DIR provisions asserted or relief requested by Plaintiff. Defendant was an
independent contractor. (b) Rocio Rivera – 562-321-3723. (c) 1099.”  
 
The court finds Quik Tow’s response to Form Interrogatory No.
15.1 is incomplete and evasive.  A
further response is warranted.  
 
Form Interrogatory No. 17.1: Is your response to each request for admission served with
these interrogatories as an unqualified admission? If not, for each response
that is not a qualified admission: (a) state the number of the request; (b)
state all facts upon which you base your response; (c) state the name,
ADDRESSES, and telephone numbers of all PERSONS who have knowledge of those
facts; and (d) identify all DOCUMENTS and other tangible things that support
your response and state the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the PERSON
who has each DOCUMENT or thing.
 
Quik Tow responded: “#29 RFA Set 2 Plaintiff was an
independent contractor, providing a specialized service for the business that
was beyond the normal scope and equipment capability of the company. He
provided long-hail towing which we did not prior to his approaching the company
with this new business opportunity. 1099 Rocio Rivera 562-321-3732.”  
 
The court finds Quik Tow’s response to Form Interrogatory
No. 17.1 is incomplete and evasive.  A
further response is warranted.  
 
            Special
Interrogatory No. 6:  Please
IDENTIFY each and every one of YOUR employees who worked with PLAINTIFF during
PLAINTIFF’s employment with you.”  The Definitions
and Explanations section of the discovery requests states the “term “IDENTIFY,”
when used in relation to an individual, shall be interpreted as requesting the
name, current address, last known address if no current address is known, phone
number, job title or position held with Defendant or its company, whether the person
is presently employed by respondent, and if not, whether Defendant or any of
its employees or agents knows of the person's whereabouts.”  
 
            Quik Tow
responded:  “Carlos Delgado: 840-213-5012.
Rocio Rivera: 562-321-3723. Julio Martinez: 562-391-8743. Francisco Torres:
909-218-0191.”
 
            The court
finds Quik Tow’s response to Special Interrogatory No. 6 is incomplete and
evasive.  A further response is
warranted.  
 
            Request
for Production, Nos. 1, 2, 4-8, 19, 20,
31, 35, and 39: 
 
            Quik Tow
responded as follows to Nos. 1, 2, 4-8, 19, 20, 31, 35, and 39: “Responding
party will comply with the particular demand. The item(s) will be allowed in
whole and all documents or things in the demanded category that are in the
possession, custody, or control will be included in the production.”
 
            Plaintiff
argues a further response is warranted because it does not comply with Code of
Civil Procedure section 2031.220.[2]  Section 2031.220 provides, “A statement that
the party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling has
been directed will comply with the particular demand shall state that the
production, inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, and related activity
demanded, will be allowed either in whole or in part, and that all documents or
things in the demanded category that are in the possession, custody, or control
of that party and to which no objection is being made will be included in the
production.”  The court agrees. A further
response to Nos. 1, 2, 4-8, 19, 20, 31, and 35 is warranted. 
 
Request for Production, Nos. 25 and 28:  
 
            Quik Tow
responded to Nos. 25 and 28 as follows: “Responding party lacks the ability to
comply with the demand. Responding party affirms that a diligent search and a
reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply with the demand in
full, but the particular one or more items have been lost. Responding party
does not know of any natural person or organization to have possession,
custody, or control of that item or category of item.”
 
            Plaintiff
seeks a further response to Nos. 25 and 28 because Quick Tow “does not state
that it is not in possession of any responsive documents, or that all
responsive documents have been lost.”  In
other words, Plaintiff argues Quik Tow’s response is to Nos. 25 and 28 are not
Code-compliant.  The court agrees.  
 
A representation of inability to comply under section
2031.230 has three parts:¿ the statement must¿(1) affirm that a diligent search
and reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to comply, and¿ (2) the
statement shall specify whether the inability to comply is because “the
particular item or category has never existed, has been destroyed, has been
lost, misplaced, or stolen, or has never been, or is no longer, in the
possession, custody, or control of the responding party.”¿¿And, (3) The third
part comes into play if the responding party knows or believes someone else has
possession of the documents:¿ if so, “[t]he statement shall set forth the name
and address of any natural person or organization known or believed by that
party to have possession, custody, or control of that item or category of
item.”¿ 
 
Here, Quik Tow’s response to Nos. 25 and 28 is evasive and
incomplete as it is unclear if Quik Tow possesses some documents that are
responsive to Nos. 25 and 28.  A further response
to Requests for Production, Nos. 25 and 28 is warranted.
 
            Monetary
Sanctions
 
            Plaintiff
requests sanctions against Quik Tow and its counsel.  Given the Court has granted the motions,
sanctions are warranted.  Pursuant to Hennings, supra,
imposition of monetary sanctions against counsel is also proper unless counsel
shows that he or she did not counsel the discovery abuse.¿ (Hennings, 58
Cal.App.5th at p. 81.)¿ Defense counsel does not meet their burden. 
Accordingly, sanctions are imposed against Quik Tow and its attorney of record
in the amount of $1,860, consisting of three hours at plaintiff’s counsel
hourly rate and $210 in filing fees.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The motions
to compel further responses to Form Interrogatories (General), Set One, Nos.
12.1, 15.1, and 17.1, Special Interrogatories, Set One, No. 6, and Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. 1, 2, 4-8, 19, 20, 25, 28, 31, 35, and
39 are GRANTED.  Defendant Quik Tow LLC
is ordered to provide further responses within 15 days of this order.
 
            The
requests for sanctions are granted. 
Defendant Quik Tow LLC and its counsel are ordered to pay, jointly and
severally, sanctions in the sum of $1,860, to be paid to Plaintiff, by and
through his counsel within 30 days of this order.
