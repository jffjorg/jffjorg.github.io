of action fail because Lim complained to AOOS rather than to a governmental
agency or body.  However, AOOS relies on authority
that has been superseded by statute. 
Under the plain terms of Labor Code section 1102.5, retaliation is
actionable for disclosure of information “to a person with authority over
the employee or another employee who has the authority to investigate,
discover, or correct the violation or noncompliance.”  (Lab. Code, § 1102.5, subd. (b), emphasis added.)  The court sustains the demurrer to the Sixth
and Seventh Causes of Action on other grounds.
