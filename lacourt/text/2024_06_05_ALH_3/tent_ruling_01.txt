Plaintiff Georgina Onaga, as trustee of
the Kiyoko Keefe Trust, seeks a default judgment against defendant Krystal Clay
for unpaid rent and repairs to property. On May 17, 2024, Plaintiff submitted a
revised proposed judgment specifying a total judgment of $50,473.04. Plaintiff
identified $435 in costs and incorrectly claimed $50,038.44 in damages, which
contradicts the $50,038.04 in damages claimed on Form CIV-100. Therefore, the Court
interlineates the claimed damages on the proposed judgment and enters a default
judgment of $50,473.04, consisting of $435 in costs and $50,038.04 in damages.
