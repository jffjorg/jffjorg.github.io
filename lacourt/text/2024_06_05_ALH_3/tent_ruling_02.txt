I.      INTRODUCTION
         On September
25, 2023, plaintiffs Michelle Angel Aguilar and Esperanza de la Rosa Vazquez (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) filed this action against defendants Cerritos Ford, Inc. dba Norm
Reeves Ford Superstore (“Defendant”) and Ford Motor Company (“Ford”). Plaintiff
filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on December 12, 2023. 
          On
January 16, 2024, Defendant filed this demurrer to Plaintiffs’ fourth cause of
action for negligent repair. The demurrer is unopposed.  
II.     LEGAL
STANDARDS
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency
of the pleadings and will be sustained only where the pleading is defective on
its face. (City of Atascadero v. Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 445, 459.)
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded but not
contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. We accept the factual
allegations of the complaint as true and also consider matters which may be
judicially noticed. [Citation.]” (Mitchell
v. California Department of Public Health (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 1000, 1007; Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials
Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604 [“the facts alleged in the pleading are
deemed to be true, however improbable they may be”].) Allegations are to be
liberally construed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) In construing the allegations,
the court is to give effect to specific factual allegations that may modify or
limit inconsistent general or conclusory allegations. (Financial Corporation of America v. Wilburn (1987) 189 Cal.App.3rd
764, 769.) 
III.    DISCUSSION
To state a claim for negligent repair,
a plaintiff must allege that the repair facility (1) owed a duty to use
ordinary care and skill, (2) breached its duty, (3) caused damage to the
plaintiff, and (4) that this caused the plaintiff to sustain damages. (Lytle
v. Ford Motor Co. (E.D. Cal. 2018) 2018 WL 4793800, citing Burgess v.
Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 1064, 1072.) Here, Plaintiffs fail to identify
they suffered any damages from Defendant’s alleged negligent repair because
they allege that the repairs were “performed under warranty [sic] issued by
[Ford].” (FAC, ¶ 6.) Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer is SUSTAINED. 
IV.    CONCLUSION
Defendant’s demurrer to the Fourth
Cause of Action is SUSTAINED. Because Plaintiffs did not oppose the demurrer or
argue how amendment is possible, the demurrer is sustained without leave to
amend.
