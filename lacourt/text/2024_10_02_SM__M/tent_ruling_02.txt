LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (CCP §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the
factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28
Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the
construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore
Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations
omitted.) 
 
A special demurrer for uncertainty is
disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that
defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what
issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed
against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat
vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)  
 
Any party, within the time allowed to
respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole
or any part thereof. (CCP § 435(b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1322(b).)
The court may, upon a motion or at any time in its discretion and upon terms it
deems proper: (1) strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted
in any pleading; or (2) strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or
filed in conformity with the laws of California, a court rule, or an order of
the court. (CCP §§ 436(a)-(b); Stafford v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767,
782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not essential to the claim is surplusage;
probative facts are surplusage and may be stricken out or disregarded”].) 
 
“Liberality in permitting amendment is
the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to show¿in
what manner¿plaintiff can amend the complaint, and¿how¿that
amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.¿(Id.) 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Defendant General Motors LLC demurs to
Plaintiff Daniel Robert Lewis’s Second Amended Complaint (SAC), including the
first cause of action for fraudulent concealment and second cause of action for
a violation of Business & Professions Code section 17200.
 
Fraud
 
Defendant argue that the fraud cause of action fails
because the SAC does not specifically allege (1) the identity of the individuals
at GM who purportedly concealed material facts or made untrue representations
about the Bolt; (2) their authority to speak and act on behalf of GM; (3) GM’s
knowledge about alleged defects in Plaintiff’s Bolt at the time of sale; (4)
any interactions with GM before or during the purchase of his Bolt; or (5) GM’s
intent to induce reliance by Plaintiff to purchase the specific Bolt at issue.
 
The
elements of fraud are: “(a) misrepresentation (false representation,
concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c)
intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e)
resulting damage.” (Charnay v. Cobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 184.)
In California, fraud, including negligent misrepresentation, must be pled with
specificity. (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th
167, 184.) “The particularity demands that a plaintiff plead facts which show
how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were
tendered.” (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462,
1469.) Negligent misrepresentation requires the defendant to make false
statements believing them to be true, but without reasonable ground for such
belief. (Bily v. Arthur Young & Co. (1992) 3 Cal.4th 370, 407.)
 
Absent
a fiduciary duty, there are at least three instances in which a cause of action
for non-disclosure of material facts may arise: “(1) the defendant makes
representations but does not disclose facts which materially qualify the facts
disclosed, or which render his disclosure likely to mislead;¿(2) the facts are
known or accessible only to defendant, and defendant knows they are not known
to or reasonably discoverable by the Plaintiffs;¿(3) the defendant actively
conceals discovery from the Plaintiffs.” (Warner Constr. Corp. v. City of
Los Angeles¿(1970) 2 Cal.3d¿285, 294.) A specific, direct commercial transaction
between plaintiff and defendant may give rise to a duty to disclose material
facts concerning the transaction. (Bigler-Engler v. Breg, Inc. (2017) 7
Cal.App.5th 276, 312; LiMandri v. Judkins¿(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326, 337.)

 
The Court sustained the demurrer to the FAC, in
part, because it did not allege the specific authority that the representative
had to make any representations on behalf of GM. (See Tarmann v. State Farm
Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., (1991) 2 Cal. App. 4th 153, 157 [plaintiff
was required to allege the names of the persons who made the allegedly
fraudulent representations and their authority to speak, beyond general
allegations that the persons were “authorized
agents” and were “adjustors and/or claims supervisors/managers”].) The FAC
alleged that in June 2021, a salesperson spoke to Plaintiff about the Subject
Vehicle and represented how far it could drive on a single charge and reiterated
written representations GM made in its advertisements and publications
regarding the 2021 Chevrolet Bolt EV, among other representations. (FAC ¶¶ 8,
39.) Since the FAC alleged that Plaintiff relied on affirmative
misrepresentations, the Court required further facts concerning the authority
that the salesperson had to make representations on behalf of GM. 
 
The SAC attempts to avoid this issue by relying
solely on allegations of concealment by nondisclosure, rather than false representations.
(SAC ¶ 30.) Plaintiff notes that “[t]he requirement of specificity is relaxed
when the allegations indicate that the defendant must necessarily possess full
information concerning the facts of the controversy or when the facts lie more
in the knowledge of the opposite party.” (Tarmann, supra, 2 Cal. App.
4th at 158.) Indeed, caselaw has recognized that less specificity is required for
pleading fraud if it appears from the nature of allegations that defendant must
necessarily possess full information, or if the facts lie more in the knowledge
of opposing parties. (Alfaro v. Community Housing Improvement System &
Planning Assn., Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1384-1385 [“it does not
appear necessary to require each of the 38 plaintiffs to allege each occasion
on which an agent of either defendant could have disclosed …. Surely defendants
have records of their dealings with the plaintiffs”] accord Bushell v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 915, 931 [“plaintiffs did
not have to specify the … personnel who prepared these documents because that
information is uniquely within … [defendant’s] knowledge”].) “‘[T]he courts
should not ... seek to absolve the defendant from liability on highly technical
requirements of form in pleading. Pleading facts in ordinary and concise
language is as permissible in fraud cases as in any others, and liberal
construction of the pleading is as much a duty of the court in these as in
other cases.’” (Appollo Capital Fund, LLC v. Roth Capital Partners, LLC
(2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 226, 242.) Logically, the rule of specificity of
pleading is intended to apply only to affirmative representations and not to
fraud by concealment. (Alfaro, supra, 171 Cal.App.4th at 1384.)
As the Alfaro court observed: “it is harder to apply [the requirement of
specificity] to a case of simple nondisclosure. ‘How does one show “how” and
“by what means” something didn't happen, or “when” it never happened, or
“where” it never happened?’ ” (Ibid.; see Jones v. ConocoPhillips
(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1187, 1200 [concealment is sufficiently pled when the
complaint as a whole provides sufficient notice of the claims against
defendants].) 
 
Plaintiff
argues that the SAC relies purely on an omission by GM. The SAC alleges that GM
concealed certain material facts concerning the Subject Vehicle, including that
it was equipped with a defective battery that had shorter range and can cause a
fire. (SAC, ¶¶ 13-26.) As a matter of ultimate fact, GM was allegedly aware of
the battery problems with the Vehicle prior to the Subject Vehicle’s June 27,
2021, lease. (SAC ¶ 13.) The SAC supports this conclusion by alleging facts
showing that GM had knowledge of the battery defect since at least 2017 through
its internal analysis and feedback. (¶¶ 13-26.) If Plaintiff knew of the defect
at the at the time of lease, Plaintiff would not have leased the Subject
Vehicle. (¶¶ 27-28.)
 
GM allegedly concealed,
suppressed and/or omitted material facts concerning the presence of the
defective high voltage battery pack in the Vehicle which posed a material fire-safety
risk to consumers. (¶¶ 30-31.) GM possessed superior and exclusive knowledge
regarding the defect through various means including, but not limited to,
customer complaints, internal investigations, and internal testing. (Id.) GM
knew of the defect, and never intended to replace the battery during the
warranty periods. (¶¶ 32-33.) GM knew its
concealment and suppression of the battery defect would “encourage Plaintiff to
purchase the defective vehicle,” and that GM therefore “intended to defraud”
Plaintiff. (¶ 34.) Plaintiff had no knowledge of the defect, and had he been
aware of the defect, he would not have leased the Vehicle. (¶ 35.) As a result
of the omission of the safety defect, Plaintiff has a Vehicle that cannot fully
charge or park indoors due to the risk of fire. (¶ 36.)
 
The SAC thereby
establishes that GM had a duty to disclose the fire risk posed by the battery
defect. GM allegedly knew the truth of battery defect to the exclusion of
Plaintiff. GM intended that their non-disclosure
would induce Plaintiff into purchasing the vehicle. Plaintiff justifiably
relied on the non-disclosure when leasing the Vehicle, and, as a result,
suffered damages. Thus, the pleading standard for fraud-by-omission is met.
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer is OVERRULED.
 
UCL
 
GM reiterates its
argument against the fraud cause of action. GM asserts that the SAC does not meet
the heightened pleading standards for fraud. A demurrer is properly sustained
under the “unlawful” prong if a complaint “identifies no particular section of
the statutory scheme which was violated.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc.
(1994) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 619.) Here, Plaintiff’s UCL claim alleges that GM’s
conduct was “unlawful because, as set forth herein, it violates the
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act and the Consumer Legal Remedies Act”. (SAC ¶
39.) Thus, the cause is not entirely premised on fraud. Moreover, a “fraudulent
business practice” under section 17200 ‘is not based upon proof of the common
law tort of deceit or deception, but is instead premised on whether the public
is likely to be deceived.’” (Pastoria v. Nationwide Ins. (2003) 112
Cal.App.4th 1490, 1498.) GM does not cite any authority which suggests that UCL
claims would be subject to the same heightened pleading standard as common law fraud.
In any case, the pleading standard for fraud is met, as discussed above.
 
GM also argues
that Plaintiff lacks standing to recover under the UCL. A
private party has standing to bring a UCL claim if he or she has suffered
injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of unfair
competition. (Law Offices of Mathew Higbee v. Expungement Assistance
Services (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 544, 555-56.) Any “identifiable trifle [of
injury] is enough for standing . . . .” (Id. at 561; see Kwikset
Corp. v. Superior Court (2011) 51 Cal.4th 310, 324 [a plaintiff must have
lost money or property to have standing to allege a UCL claim].) The SAC alleges sufficient facts for UCL
standing. Plaintiff allegedly leased the vehicle in reliance on the alleged nondisclosures,
thereby losing money in the Lease transaction and thereby suffering an injury
in fact. (SAC ¶ 36.) This is an identifiable injury sufficient for UCL standing.
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer is OVERRULED.
 
Punitive Damages
 
GM moves to strike
the request for punitive damages on the grounds that the causes of action
cannot support the imposition of punitive damages, and the SAC fails to allege
facts showing that it “intentional[ly] misrepresent[ed], decei[ved], or
conceal[ed] . . . a material fact known to [GM] with the intention . . . of . .
. depriving [Plaintiff] of property or legal rights or otherwise causing
injury.” (Civ. Code § 3294(c)(3).) GM argues that the SAC does not allege
whether Plaintiff had any interaction with GM before or after the lease; nor
did he identify when, where, or how anyone from GM misrepresented the condition
or quality of the Bolt, or any actual misrepresentation or omission. GM reasons
that without such facts pled, Plaintiff cannot pursue a claim for punitive
damages. However, as discussed infra, the SAC establishes that GM intentionally
concealed the material battery defect from Plaintiff with the intention of
inducing Plaintiff to purchase the defective vehicle. Thus, the SAC pleads
sufficient facts for fraud as defined by the punitive damages statute.
 
Accordingly,
the motion to strike is DENIED.
