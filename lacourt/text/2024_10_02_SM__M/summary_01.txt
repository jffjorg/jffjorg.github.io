And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for an order permitting Alan Grayson, an attorney from another jurisdiction, to appear pro hac vice in the State of California. The motion is granted because the application submitted by Grayson satisfies the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 9.40. The application includes the required information, including Grayson's residence and office addresses, his admission to other courts, and a representation that he is a member in good standing and is not currently suspended or disbarred. The $50.00 fee required by rule 9.40 has also been paid. Therefore, the application is granted and Grayson is permitted to appear pro hac vice in this case.
