And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Daniel Robert Lewis v. General Motors LLC, et al. The case involves a claim for fraudulent concealment and a violation of the Unfair Competition Law (UCL) based on General Motors' alleged concealment of a battery defect in a 2021 Chevrolet Bolt EV.

The judge has overruled General Motors' demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) on the grounds that the SAC alleges sufficient facts to establish a cause of action for fraudulent concealment. The judge has also overruled General Motors' demurrer to the UCL claim, finding that the SAC alleges sufficient facts to establish a claim for unfair competition.

The judge has denied General Motors' motion to strike the request for punitive damages, finding that the SAC alleges sufficient facts to establish a claim for fraud as defined by the punitive damages statute.

The judge has ordered General Motors to file an answer to the SAC within 20 days.
