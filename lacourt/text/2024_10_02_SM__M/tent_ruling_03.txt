Standard
 
Relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b)
is either discretionary or mandatory. A motion for mandatory relief must be
made no more than six months after entry of judgment and be accompanied by an
attorney’s sworn affidavit attesting to the attorney’s “mistake, inadvertence,
surprise or neglect.” (CCP § 473(b).) The attorney affidavit of fault must
contain a “straight forward admission of fault.” (State Farm Fire &
Casualty Co. v. Pietak (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 600, 610.) But it need
not contain an explanation of the reasons for the attorney’s mistake,
inadvertence surprise or neglect. (Martin
Potts & Assocs., Inc. v. Corsair, LLC (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 432, 438-441.) Relief must be granted
“unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by
the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Ibid.) If mandatory relief is
granted, the court must “direct
the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs” to the
opposing counsel or parties. (CCP § 473(b).)
 
Where a party cannot obtain an attorney affidavit of
fault, the party may seek discretionary relief under section 473(b) due to
“mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 473(b).) A
motion for discretionary relief must be made “within a reasonable time but in
no instance exceeding six months after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.” (Id.) If discretionary relief is granted, the court may
in its discretion order the moving party to pay the costs, including attorney fees,
incurred in obtaining the default. (Rogalski v. Nabers Cadillac (1992)
11 Cal.App.4th 816, 823; Vanderkous v. Conley (2010) 188
Cal.App.4th 111, 118-119.) If the motion for discretionary relief is granted,
the court may order the offending attorney to pay monetary sanctions up to
$1,000 to opposing parties, or up to $1,000 to the State Bar Client Security
Fund, or “[g]rant other relief as is appropriate.” (CCP § 473(c)(1)(A), (B),
(C).)
 
A motion for relief under section 473(b) “shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted. . .” (CCP § 473(b).)
However, this requirement is
not jurisdictional; substantial compliance may suffice. (Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403
[finding substantial compliance where counsel offered proposed answer at
motion hearing rather than serving it with moving
papers].) 
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff Mark Stanley moves to
vacate the order of dismissal issued by the Court on May 2, 2024.  On May 2, 2024, Plaintiff failed to appear at
an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal for Plaintiff counsel’s failure to appear.
Plaintiff filed this motion for relief on July 8, 2024, approximately two
months after notice of the order was given by Defendant. 
 
Plaintiff demonstrates that the
dismissal resulted from his counsels’ negligence. Plaintiff presents his
counsels’ sworn affidavits,
which provides a straightforward admission of neglect. (See Makasian Decl.;
Wagner Decl.) Counsel explains counsels’ staff had scheduled that the CMC hearing
for December 8, 2023, but inadvertently failed to secure an appearance attorney.
(Wagner Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.) On February 22, 2024, counsels’ staff filed a Case
Management Statement and declaration concerning the non-appearance, but Mr.
Wagner failed to see the hearing on calendar and therefore failed to appear. (¶
7.) Counsels’ paralegal received emailed notice of the hearing, but did not see
the email. (¶ 8.; Siavii Decl., ¶¶ 3-7.) At the time of the hearing, Mr.
Makasian of the Wagner Firm was counsel of record for Plaintiff. He declares
that he was not advised of the OSC because it was inadvertently on Mr. Wagner’s
calendar. (Makasian Decl., ¶¶ 3-8.) Thus, Plaintiff explains that, though his
counsels’ negligence and errors, he failed to appear for the OSC. As
such, Plaintiff shows entitlement to mandatory relief. The Court therefore lacks
discretion to deny the motion.
 
Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.  Since mandatory relief is granted, the Court must “direct the attorney to pay
reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs” to the opposing counsel or
parties. (CCP § 473(b).) Defendant opposes but does not provide for its
reasonable fees and costs resulting from counsels’ failures to appear.  Therefore, nothing shall be awarded.
