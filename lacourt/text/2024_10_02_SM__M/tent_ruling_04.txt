MOTION:                  Motion
to Compel Initial Discovery Responses
HEARING DATE:   10/2/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
 If a
party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2030.290(b).) The statute contains no time limit for
a motion to compel where no responses have been served. All that need be shown
in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on
the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response
of any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.
App. 3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
Where there has been no timely
response to a CCP section 2031.010 inspection demand, the demanding party must
seek an order compelling a response. (CCP § 2031.300.) Failure to timely
respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product. Thus,
unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief from waiver, he
or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. There is no deadline
for a motion to compel responses. Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving
party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing the
motion. Where the motion seeks only a response to the inspection demand, no
showing of "good cause" is required. 
   
ANALYSIS 
 
  Plaintiff Can Capital Inc. moves to compel initial
discovery responses from Defendants Benjamin Sarcadi and Breaking Barriers
Developmentally Disabled Services as to their respective Special
Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents, Sets One.
On March 26, 2024, Plaintiff served on Defendant Sarcadi and Breaking
Barriers, via counsel, certain written discovery including the first sets of Special
Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents. (Katz Decl., ¶ 4,
Exs. A.)  On July 8, 2024, Defendants
served discovery responses to the Request for Production and Special
Interrogatories. (Id. Ex. E.) Defendants have provided initial responses to the
discovery. As such, the motion to compel initial discovery responses is moot. When
responses are served, the proper motion is a motion to compel further
responses, which is governed by CCP §§ 2030.300 and 2031.310. Plaintiff has not
met the procedural requirements for motions to compel further. (CRC, Rule
3.1345.)
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motions to compel initial responses are
DENIED.
