And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to vacate the order of dismissal filed by Plaintiff Mark Stanley. The dismissal was caused by the negligence of Plaintiff's counsel, who failed to appear at an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal hearing. Plaintiff's counsel's sworn affidavits admit fault and demonstrate that the dismissal was caused by their mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. The Court finds that mandatory relief is warranted and grants the motion. As a result, the Court must direct the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to the opposing counsel or parties.
