And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel initial discovery responses from the defendants. The plaintiff, Can Capital Inc., served written discovery on the defendants, Benjamin Sarcadi and Breaking Barriers Developmentally Disabled Services, on March 26, 2024, and the defendants responded on July 8, 2024. The judge found that the defendants have provided initial responses to the discovery, making the motion to compel initial responses moot. The proper motion would be a motion to compel further responses, governed by California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.300 and 2031.310. However, the plaintiff has not met the procedural requirements for this type of motion, so the motion is denied.
