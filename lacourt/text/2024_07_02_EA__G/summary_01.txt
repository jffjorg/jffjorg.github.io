Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the hearing on Tawney Alonso's petition for approval of a compromise of claim or action for Kaitlyn Alcala, a minor, to a date to be determined. The petition seeks approval of a $19,999.99 settlement between Alcala and defendant Linda Rodriguez. The judge has ordered Alcala's counsel to file a supplemental declaration in support of the request for attorney fees no later than nine court days before the hearing. The reason for the continuance is that the court needs more information about the attorney fees requested by Alcala's counsel.
