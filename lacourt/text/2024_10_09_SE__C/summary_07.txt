And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is granting in part and denying in part Plaintiff Irvin Pelagio's motion to compel Defendant FCA US LLC's further responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One), numbers 29 and 31. The motion is timely, as it was filed within the 45-day deadline from the date the verified response was served.

The judge finds that the parties sufficiently met and conferred, as evidenced by the exchange of meet and confer letters and the service of supplemental responses. However, the judge denies the motion to compel further response to Special Interrogatory No. 29, as FCA US LLC has already sufficiently answered the question.

The judge grants the motion to compel further response to Special Interrogatory No. 31, as FCA US LLC has not identified the specific repair presentations it used to calculate its pre-litigation offer. The judge orders FCA US LLC to provide a verified further response within 45 days.

Additionally, the judge notes that no sanctions will be awarded, as the motion is being granted in part and denied in part.
