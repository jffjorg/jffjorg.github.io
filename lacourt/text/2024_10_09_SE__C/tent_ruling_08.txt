TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Defendants Min Xiao and
Ke Yao’s motion to quash service of summons is MOOT. 
 
Clerk to give NOTICE.
 
The motion is unopposed as of October 7, 2024. 
 
 
This is a habitability action. Defendants
Min Xiao and Ke Yao move to quash service of summons served on them. 
 
The Complaint was filed on August 1, 2023.  
 
On February 26, 2024, Plaintiffs filed Doe
Amendments naming Defendants Min Xiao and Ke Yao as Doe 1 and Doe 2,
respectively.  
 
On March 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed Proofs of Service
by Substituted Service upon Defendants Ke Yao and Min Xiao.  
 
Plaintiffs filed the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”)
on August 9, 2024.  
 
Defendants Min Xiao and Ke Yao filed the instant
motion to quash on August 14, 2024.  The
motion challenges the validity of the March 14, 2024 proofs of service.  However, these documents relate to service of
the Complaint, which has been superseded by the First Amended Complaint.  
 
Thus, the motion is MOOT.
