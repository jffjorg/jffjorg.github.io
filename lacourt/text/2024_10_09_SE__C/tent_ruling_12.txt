TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff National Commercial
Recovery, Inc.’s motion to enforce settlement agreement is GRANTED. 
 
The motion is unopposed as of October
7, 2024.  
 
Moving party to give Notice.
 
This is a continuation. On
September 12, 2024, Plaintiff National Commercial Recovery, Inc. moved ex parte
for entry of stipulated judgment. The Court deemed the ex parte application to
be the moving papers and allowed the parties the opportunity to file opposition
and reply briefs. 
 
Legal Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 states: “If
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement
of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment
pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court
may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6,
subd. (a) [emphasis added].)
 
Discussion
 
This is an action for
common counts between two businesses. Plaintiff contends that on August 21,
2024, the parties entered into a conditional settlement which required
Defendants to make weekly payments beginning on August 22, 2024, and ending on
November 7, 2024 for a total sum of $35,292.05. (Decl. Besnyl, ¶ 2.) Defendants
have not made any payments. (Decl. Besnyl, ¶ 3, and 4.) The
parties also stipulated to give the Court jurisdiction to enforce the
settlement agreement. (Decl. Besnyl, ¶ 5; Ex. A, ¶¶ 7-8.)

 
Based
on the above, the motion to enforce settlement agreement is GRANTED.
