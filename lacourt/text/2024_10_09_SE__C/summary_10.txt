And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion of the County of Los Angeles (Plaintiff-in-Intervention) to file a complaint-in-intervention in this case. The County seeks to intervene on the grounds that it is the employer of the plaintiff and the plaintiff was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the automobile collision. The County must pay the plaintiff's indemnity and medical expenses, and under Labor Code section 3852, the employer may recover damages in addition to the total amount of compensation paid to the employee. The judge orders the County to separately file the complaint-in-intervention and serve notice of the court's decision to the parties who have appeared.
