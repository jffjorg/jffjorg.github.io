TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Plaintiff
Yesenia Garcia and Armanda Garcia’s motion to compel the deposition of Defendant
American Honda Motor Company, Inc.’s Person Most Qualified is GRANTED.  Defendant is ordered
to produce its Person Most Qualified for deposition within 60 days of the
issuance of this order.  This time may be
extended by agreement of the parties.  Monetary
sanctions are awarded.   
 
Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
This
motion is unopposed as of October 7, 2024. 
 
 
This is a Song-Beverly action. Plaintiffs Yesenia Garcia and Armando Garcia move to compel Defendant’s
Person Most Qualified (PMQ) deposition according to Code of Civil Procedure section
2025.450.  
 
Legal
Standards
 
If
a party or an officer, director, managing agent, or
employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization that is a
party under Section 2025.230 does not appear for deposition after service of a
deposition notice and the party has not validly objected, the noticing party
may move to compel the deponent’s attendance and testimony. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2025.450, subd. (a).)  
 
Article 2, commencing with Section 2025.210, sets forth
the grounds for objection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.410, subd.
(a).) A party served with a deposition notice waives any error or irregularity
unless that party serves a written objection specifying that error or
irregularity at least three calendar days before the deposition. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2025.410, subd. (a).) 
 
Further, the motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration, or, when the deponent fails to attend
the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored information, or
things described in the deposition notice, a declaration stating that the
petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b)(2).) The
declaration shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2016.040.) 
 
For purposes of
determining whether there was a reasonable and good faith effort to meet and
confer, such an attempt at informal resolution requires something more than
bickering with opposing counsel; rather, the law requires that counsel attempt
to talk the matter over, compare their views, consult, and deliberate. (Clement
v. Alegre (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1294.) 
 
Discussion
 
On April 30, 2024, Plaintiff noticed the
deposition of Defendant’s person most qualified for June 17, 2024. (Decl. Tran,
¶ 4, Ex. A.) On May 28, 2024, Plaintiff followed up on the deposition dates. (Decl.
Tran, ¶ 6, Ex. B.)  
 
On June 11,
2024, Defendant objected to the notice of deposition. (Decl. Tran, ¶ 7, Ex. C.)

 
On June 12,
2024, Plaintiff met and conferred with Defendant about Defendant’s objections.
(Decl. Tran, ¶ 8, Ex. D.)
 
On June 17,
2024, Plaintiffs sent Defendant a video link for Defendant’s witness to
participate in the deposition. (Decl. Tran, ¶ 9, Ex B.) Defendant’s counsel
stated that the witness could not be produced and that they were working on
finding a mutually agreeable deposition date. (Decl. Tran, ¶ 9, Ex. B.) 
 
On June 21,
2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel logged onto the video link. (Decl. Tran, ¶ 10, Ex B.)
 
On July 9, 2024,
Plaintiff sent a follow up email seeking dates for the deposition.  (Decl. Tran, ¶ 11, Ex. B.) As of August 9,
2024 (the motion filing date) Defendant has not responded.  
 
The motion to
compel the deposition of Defendant’s Person Most Qualified is GRANTED. Defendant
is ordered to produce its Person Most Qualified for deposition within 60 days
of the issuance of this order.  This time
may be extended by agreement of the parties. 

 
Sanctions
 
“To the extent
authorized by this chapter governing any particular discovery method or any
other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected party,
person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose [sanctions]
against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process …”
(CCP §2023.030.) Failing to respond to an authorized method of discovery and
disobeying a court order to provide discovery are both misuses of the discovery
process.” (CCP §§2023.010 (d) and (g).)
 
The Court finds
that Defendant did not meet and confer about setting deposition dates; thus, it
did not respond to an authorized method of discovery.  The Court grants attorney fees for 4.5 hours
of work, consisting of 2.5 hours at $295.00 per hour and 2 hours at $425.00 per
hour, for a total of $1,587.50. It also awards $60 in motion filing fees.
