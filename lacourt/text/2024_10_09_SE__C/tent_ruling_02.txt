Moving Party to give
NOTICE.
 
 
On April 26, 2022, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Pacific Southwest
District of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod (“PSD”) filed its complaint
against Defendant/Cross-Complainant Peace Lutheran Church (“PLC”) and Chastity Carvel
(“Carvel”), among other defendants, to recover the real property currently
occupied by PLC. 
 
On May 5, 2023, PLC filed a cross-complaint against PSD. On May
15, 2023, Carvel filed her own cross-complaint against PLC. PSD filed
anti-SLAPP motions against each of these cross-complaints. 
 
On October 25, 2023, the Court granted PSD’s special motion to
strike as to PLC’s second through tenth causes of action and denied it as to PLC’s
first cause of action, declaratory relief, without prejudice. It granted PSD’s
special motion to strike as to Carvel’s first through fourth causes of action. 
 
PSD moves for $25,979.19 in attorney fees and
costs against PLC and $22,321.52 in attorney fees and costs against Carvel. 
 
Prevailing Parties
 
Chastity
Carvel’s Cross-Complaint 
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16(c)(1)
provides that “a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be
entitled to recover his or her attorney’s fees and costs.” As to moving
parties who are partially successful as to SLAPP motions, judges must exercise
discretion in determining prevailing parties, and the amount of fees and costs
to award considering the relative success in achieving objectives. (Fremont Reorganizing Corp. v. Faigin
(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1153, 1177.)
 
Because PSD prevailed on all
four causes of action in Chastity Carvel’s cross-complaint, PSD is the
prevailing party. 
 
Peace Lutheran Church’s Cross-Complaint
 
PLC
argues that the success of the motion did not end the litigation; therefore, PSD
is not entitled to attorney’s fees. (Moran v. Endres (2006) 135
Cal.App.4th 952.)
 
In
Moran v. Endres, supra, 135 Cal.App.4th 952, church members
alleged that defendant had committed various torts as part of a wrongful
attempt to control the church, asserting causes of action for defamation, false
light, intrusion upon seclusion, assault, battery, and civil conspiracy. Defendants
filed a special motion to strike the complaint under the anti-SLAPP statute,
and the Court granted the motion as to the civil conspiracy cause of action
only. The Court held that the anti-SLAPP motion held such insignificant effect
on the lawsuit that defendants could not be viewed as prevailing for purposes
of the attorney fees award. 
 
Moran is distinguishable
from the circumstances here.  In Moran,
the Court found no change in the possible recovery against defendants before
and after the motion. (Id. at 955.)  Here, PSD is no longer
liable for damages.  In Moran, the Court found that the work
involved in trying the case did not change. (Ibid.) Here, PSD no longer is
required to defend against claims seeking medical and emotional damages. 
In Moran, the results of the motion were minimal and insignificant.”
(Ibid.) Here, nine out of the 10 causes of action were stricken. 
 
The
Court determines that PSD is the prevailing party and that a partial award of
attorney’s fees is warranted.    
 
Reasonableness of Attorney’s Fees
 
As the moving party, the prevailing defendant seeking fees and
costs bears the burden of establishing entitlement to an award and documenting
the appropriate hours expended and hourly rates. (Christian Research. Inst.
v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321 (Christian Research).)
 
To assess the fees and costs, the trial court begins with a
touchstone or lodestar figure based on the compilation of the time spent and
reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney who worked on the case. (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131–1132.) The court tabulates the
attorney fee touchstone by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended
by the reasonable hourly rate prevailing in the community for similar
work. (Id. at p. 1134; Serrano v. Priest (1977)
20 Cal.3d 25, 49.) The court may increase or decrease the lodestar figure
depending on a variety of factors, including (1) the novelty and difficulty of
the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award. (Ketchum, at
p. 1132.) The purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair
market value for the particular action. (Id.) 
 
For that purpose, the court may require a party to produce records
to provide a proper basis for determining how much time was spent on particular
claims. The court also may reduce compensation because the attorney did not
maintain appropriate time records. (ComputerXpress, Inc. v. Jackson (2001)
93 Cal.App.4th 993, 1020.) The party that seeks payment must “keep records in
sufficient detail that a neutral judge can make a fair evaluation of the time
expended, the nature and need for the service, and the reasonable fees to be
allowed.”  (Hensley v. Eckerhart (1983) 461 U.S. 424, 441 (conc.
opn. of Burger, C.J.).)  The evidence should allow the court to consider
whether the case was overstaffed, how much time the attorneys spent on
particular claims, and whether the hours were reasonably expended. (ComputerXpress,
supra, 93 Cal.App.4th 993, 1020.)
 
Contemporaneous time records in support of an attorney fee motion
are often the most useful evidence but are not indispensable.  A detailed declaration describing the legal
work done is acceptable.  (PLCM Group,
Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095, n. 4
[fee claim based on detailed reconstructed records upheld; noting that
contemporaneous records facilitate accuracy]; Taylor v. County of L. A.
(2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 205, 207 [contemporaneous time records are the
best evidence of lawyer’s hourly work; they are “not indispensable”]; People
v. Kelly (2020) 59 Cal.App.5th 1172, 1182 [“no legal requirement
that an attorney supply billing statements to support a claim for attorney
fees”; attorney declarations acceptable].) 
Block billing is not impermissible per se. (Christian
Research, supra, 165 Cal.App.4th at p. 1325.) Trial
courts retain discretion to penalize block billing when the practice prevents
them from discerning which tasks are compensable and which are not. (Heritage
Pac. Fin., LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1011.) 
 
Here, PSD submits the declarations of Jackson Leverone, David
Lenhardt, Daniel Kolcz, and Cathryn Lopez. But the declarations and supporting
documents do not distinguish what work the attorneys performed regarding Peace
Lutheran Church’s cross-complaint and what work the attorneys performed
regarding Chastity Carvel’s cross-complaint. Without further information, the
Court cannot determine whether the fees are reasonable. 
 
Thus, the motion for attorney fees is CONTINUED to Wednesday, December 4, 2024 at 10:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C. PSD is
to submit further information that distinguishes the work the attorneys
performed regarding Peace Lutheran Church’s cross-complaint and the work the
attorneys performed regarding Chastity Carvel’s cross-complaint. This will be
due 16 court days before the hearing date. Any oppositions will be due 9 court
days before the hearing. Any replies will be due 5 court days before the
hearing.
