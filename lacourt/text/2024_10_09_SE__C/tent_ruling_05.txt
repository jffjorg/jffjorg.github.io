RULING
 
Defendant
Rudy Espinoza’s motion to set aside default is
CONTINUED to October 30, 2024 at 10:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C.  Defendant is ORDERED to file a responsive
pleading on or before October 23, 2024.  

 
Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
This
motion is unopposed as of October 1, 2024. 
 
 
This
is an action for breach of contract and common counts. 
 
On
March 14, 2024, default was entered against defendant Rudy Espinoza.  
 
Defendant
seeks to set aside default based upon mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect under CCP § 473, subd. (b). 
 
Discussion
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivision (b) states: 
 
The court may, upon any
terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her
through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy
of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable
time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.  
 
The
purpose of mandatory relief is to alleviate the hardship on parties who lose
their day in court due to an inexcusable failure to act by their attorneys. (Rodriguez v. Brill
(2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 715, 723.) “Section 473 is often applied liberally where
the party in default moves promptly to seek relief, and the party opposing the
motion will not suffer prejudice if relief is granted. [Citations.] In such
situations ‘very slight evidence will be required to justify a court in setting
aside the default.’ [Citations.] [¶] Moreover, because the law strongly favors
trial and disposition on the merits, any doubts in applying section 473 must be
resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default.” (Fasuyi v.
Permatex, Inc. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 681, 695.)
 
Here, default was entered on March 14, 2024,
and Defendant filed the instant motion on April 19, 2024, within the six-month time
specified in CCP § 473.  Hence, the
motion is timely.  
 
Defendant states that he was hospitalized
during the response time. (Decl. Espinoza, ¶ 3.) This is inadvertence and
excusable neglect. 
 
Defendant did not include a copy of the answer
and cross-complaint. 
 
Based upon
this, the Court is inclined to set aside default.  However, Defendant has not attached a
responsive pleading to the motion.  “Application
for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading
proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted.”
(CCP § 473, subd. (b).)  Therefore, the motion
to set aside default is CONTINUED to October 30, 2024 at 10:30 A.M. in Dept.
SE-C.  Defendant is ORDERED to file a
responsive pleading on or before October 23, 2024.
