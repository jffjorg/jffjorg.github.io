The Plaintiff, Stewart Title Guaranty Company, had requested to have its Motion heard prior to the trial date, but no earlier than December 18, 2024. However, the Court's congested calendar cannot accommodate this request. As a result, the trial date will proceed as scheduled on January 17, 2025. The parties are not precluded from seeking a trial continuance, but absent agreement or stipulation, the Court is unable to continue the trial date.
