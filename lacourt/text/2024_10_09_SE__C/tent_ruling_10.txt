TENTATIVE
RULING
 
Plaintiff-in-Intervention’s
motion for leave to file complaint-in-intervention is GRANTED.
 
Moving
Party to give NOTICE.
 
The
motion is unopposed as of October 7, 2024. 
 
 
This is about an automobile collision between
two vehicles. The plaintiff is the driver of one of the vehicles and defendants
are the driver, owner, and lessor of the other vehicle.  At the time of the accident, Plaintiff was
employed by the County of Los Angeles.  
 
Plaintiff-in-Intervention County of Los Angeles
seeks leave to intervene in the complaint based on Labor Code section 3852.
 
Discussion
 
Where
an employee brings an action for damages proximately caused by a third person,
an employer who pays or becomes obligated to pay compensation, or salary in
lieu of compensation, may likewise make a claim or bring an action against the
third person.  (Lab. Code, § 3852.)  “[T]he employer may recover in
the same suit, in addition to the total amount of compensation, damages for
which he or she was liable including all salary, wage, pension, or other
emolument paid to the employee or to his or her dependents.”  (Ibid.)  
 
“A
workers’ compensation carrier is authorized to attempt recovery of benefits
paid either through the maintenance of an independent action (Lab. Code, §
3852), intervention in the employee’s action (Lab. Code, § 3853), or assertion
of lien rights in the employee’s recovery (Lab. Code, § 3856, subd.
(b).)”  (Catello v. I.T.T. General Controls (1984) 152 Cal.App.3d
1009, 1015, fn. 7.) 
 
Here,
County of Los Angeles seeks leave to file a complaint-in-intervention on
grounds that it is Plaintiff’s employer, and Plaintiff was acting in the course
and scope of his employment with the County of Los Angeles when the alleged
accident occurred. (Decl. Fox, ¶ 2.) Further, County of Los Angeles must pay
Plaintiff’s indemnity and medical expenses. (Decl. Fox, ¶ 2.) 
 
Based on the above, the
motion is granted. Intervenor shall separately file
the complaint in intervention and serve notice of the court’s decision to
parties who have appeared. (Code Civ. Proc. § 387, subd. (e).)
