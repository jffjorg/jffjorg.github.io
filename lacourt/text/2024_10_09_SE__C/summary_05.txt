And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of U.S. National Bank Association v. Rudy Espinoza. The defendant, Rudy Espinoza, has filed a motion to set aside a default judgment entered against him on March 14, 2024. Espinoza claims that he was hospitalized during the response time and that his failure to file a responsive pleading was due to excusable neglect.

The judge has decided to continue the motion to set aside default to October 30, 2024, at 10:30 A.M. in Dept. SE-C. Espinoza is ordered to file a responsive pleading on or before October 23, 2024. The judge is inclined to set aside the default, but notes that Espinoza has not attached a copy of the answer and cross-complaint to the motion as required by CCP ยง 473, subdivision (b).
