And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge C Stovall regarding a hearing on October 9, 2024. The defendants, Min Xiao and Ke Yao, have moved to quash the service of summons, claiming that the proofs of service are invalid. However, the Judge has determined that the motion is moot because the original complaint has been superseded by a First Amended Complaint, which was filed on August 9, 2024. The motion to quash challenges the validity of the proofs of service, which were filed on March 14, 2024, for the original complaint. Since the original complaint is no longer in effect, the motion to quash is no longer relevant.
