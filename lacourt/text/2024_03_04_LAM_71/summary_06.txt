And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's default judgment packet and set a hearing on an order to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or the plaintiff's counsel should be sanctioned for failing to enter default judgment. The hearing is scheduled for April 4, 2024, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse. The judge's decision is based on the plaintiff's incorrect calculation of attorney fees, which is in violation of Local Rule 3.2. The plaintiff had requested attorney fees in the amount of $3,880.43, but the correct calculation would result in a fee of $2,679.00. The judge is requiring the plaintiff's counsel to attend the hearing and explain the discrepancy in their calculation.
