  MANUEL OLAZABAL, et al.


 Case No.: 
  22STCV37457
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  March 4, 2024



 
The Court
denies Plaintiff’s default judgment packet. 

The Court sets a hearing on an order to show cause why the complaint
should not be dismissed and/or Plaintiff’s counsel sanctioned $250 for failing
to enter default judgment (California Rule of Court, rule 3.110(h)) on April 4,
2024, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse for the following
reasons:

1.     Attorneys’
fees are incorrectly calculated according to Local Rule 3.2 schedule.
 
Plaintiff requests attorney fees in
the amount of $3,880.43.  Plaintiff
incorrectly calculates attorneys’ fees as $1,890 + (2% x excess of $50,000,
$99,521.92 = 1,990.43)
Attorneys’ fees should be
calculated as follows:
$89,450.00
- $50,000 = $39,450 x .02 = 789 + 1,890 = $2,679.00
