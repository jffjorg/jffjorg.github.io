And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of defendants' counsel, Karen A. Rooney, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed on February 9, 2024, and the court has reviewed the necessary forms and declarations. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and the motion has been granted as long as there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. The motion was granted because counsel has provided a declaration stating a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship, and has served notice of the motion on all other parties. Counsel will be relieved as counsel upon filing proof of service on their client of the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel.
