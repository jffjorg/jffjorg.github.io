And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The motion to disqualify counsel, Guy E. Jamison, is denied. The Court finds that Plaintiff Ernest J. Franceschi, Jr. has not met his burden of showing an attorney-client relationship with Jamison that creates a conflict of interest through concurrent conflicting representations. The Court also finds that there is no evidence of any confidential information shared between Jamison and Plaintiff, and that Jamison's representation of HHO and its general partner, Wolfe, does not automatically create an attorney-client relationship with HHO's limited partners, including Plaintiff.

The Court also notes that the purpose of the "advocate-witness rule" is to protect the client, and that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any specific prejudice would result from Jamison's dual capacity as an advocate and witness. The Court concludes that given the lack of standing, the lack of authority requiring disqualification under these circumstances, and the importance of a client's right to choose their counsel, the motion to disqualify counsel is denied.

Additionally, the Court orders Plaintiff to file a Notice of Related Cases in this action and in the Hawthorne Hangar action, LASC No. 21STCV39700, on or before January 24, 2025.
