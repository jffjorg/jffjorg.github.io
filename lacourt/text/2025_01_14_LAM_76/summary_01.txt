And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for terminating sanctions filed by All Star Travel Holdings (Defendant) against a travel agency (Plaintiffs). The motion was based on the Plaintiffs' failure to comply with a discovery order to identify responsive documents by August 9, 2024. The judge has denied the motion without prejudice, meaning that the Defendant can still bring the motion again in the future. The judge's decision was based on the fact that the Plaintiffs did not withhold production of documents, but rather made it difficult for the Defendant to evaluate the production. The judge also noted that the Defendant has alternative options, such as organizing the responsive documents itself and seeking sanctions against the Plaintiffs for the actual costs of such organization.
