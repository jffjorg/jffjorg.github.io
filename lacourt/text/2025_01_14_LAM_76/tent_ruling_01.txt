ANALYSIS
Motion For Terminating, Issue and/or Evidentiary
Sanctions
            Defendant
All Star Travel Holdings moves for terminating sanctions based upon Plaintiffs’
failure to comply with the Court’s July 11, 2024 discovery order that
Plaintiffs identify responsive documents in accordance with Civ. Proc. Code, §
2031.280(a) by August 9, 2024
The court has the authority to
impose sanctions against a party that engages in the misuse of the discovery
process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) This includes failing to respond to an
authorized method of discovery and disobeying a court order to provide
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 2023.010 (d) and (g).)  A party engaging in such conduct may be
subject to monetary, issue and/or evidentiary, and terminating sanctions. (Code
Civ. Proc. §§ 2023.030(a), (b) (c) and (d).)           
            Where a
party fails to obey an order compelling responses, “the court may make those
orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction . . . In lieu of or in addition to
that sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction. . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(c); §
2031.300(c).) Indeed, the court may impose terminating sanctions after a
party’s failure to comply with one court order to produce discovery if it is an
“attempt[ ] to tailor the sanction to the harm caused by the withheld
discovery.” (Collisson & Kaplan v.
Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1618-19.)
 
"[T]he question before this court
is not whether the trial court should have imposed a lesser sanction; rather,
the question is whether the trial court abused its discretion by imposing the
sanction it chose. [Citation.] Moreover, imposition of a lesser sanction would
have permitted [defendants] to benefit from their stalling tactics. [Citation.]
The trial court did not abuse its discretion by tailoring the sanction to the
particular abuse. [Citation.]" ( Id. at pp. 36-37.) 

(Collisson, supra, 21 Cal.App.4th at
1620.)
            In deciding
whether to impose a terminating sanction, the trial court is to consider the
totality of the circumstances: “conduct of the party to determine if the
actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the number of
formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.” (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)
            In
the instant matter, the Court indicated in its July 11, 2024 minute order that
if Defendant wishes to obtain such organization sooner, Defendant may undertake
the costs of organizing the documents itself, then seek sanctions against
Plaintiffs for the actual costs of such organization. This appears to be
Defendant’s recourse. Plaintiffs have not withheld production of documents, but
have only made it difficult for Defendant to evaluate such production.
Defendant has not demonstrated that it would be impossible to do so. If Defendant
attempts to organize the responsive documents to no avail, then Defendant may
bring a renewed motion for terminating, issue and/or evidentiary sanctions.
            As
such, the motion for sanctions is DENIED without prejudice.
