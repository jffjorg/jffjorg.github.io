The court is considering a dispute over the method of appointing an arbitrator in an arbitration agreement. The agreement does not specify a method, and the parties cannot agree on one. The court has the authority to appoint an arbitrator in this situation. The court's process for appointment involves nominating five persons from lists supplied by the parties or a governmental agency. The parties may jointly select an arbitrator from this list, or if they fail to do so, the court will appoint one from the list. This process is governed by California Code of Civil Procedure, ยง 1281.6.
