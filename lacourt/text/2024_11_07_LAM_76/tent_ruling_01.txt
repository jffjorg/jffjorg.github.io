Motion For Attorney’s
Fees
Discussion
Following a court trial, judgment
was entered on July 10, 2024 in favor of Plaintiff in the principal amount of
$313,000.00. Plaintiff seeks an award of attorney’s fees in the amount of
$162,936.00[1].  pursuant to Civil Code, § 1717(a), which
provides in pertinent part:   
(a) In any action on a contract,
where the contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which
are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the
parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the
party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in
the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in
addition to other costs.
 
Where a contract provides for
attorney’s fees, as set forth above, that provision shall be construed as
applying to the entire contract, unless each party was represented by counsel
in the negotiation and execution of the contract, and the fact of that representation
is specified in the contract.
 
Reasonable attorney’s fees shall be
fixed by the court, and shall be an element of the costs of suit.

     (Civ. Code § 1717(a).)
            The
Promissory Note provides for the recovery of attorney’s fees as follows: 
In the event the Note shall be in
default and given to an attorney for collection or enforcement, or if suit is
brought for collection or enforcement, or if it is collected or enforced
through probate, bankruptcy, or other judicial proceeding, then Borrower shall
pay Lender all costs of collection and enforcement.
     (Promissory Note,
¶ 5; Complaint, Exh. A.)
The
determination of reasonable amount of attorney fees is within the sound
discretion of trial courts. (PLCM Group
v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095; Akins v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000) 79 Cal. App. 4th 1127, 1134.) “The
determination of what constitutes a reasonable fee generally ‘begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate….’”  “[T]he lodestar
is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the community; it may be
adjusted by the court based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the
novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in
presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded
other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee
award….”  (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th
140, 154.) In setting the hourly rate for an attorney fees award, courts are
entitled to consider the rate of “‘fees customarily charged by that attorney
and others in the community for similar work.’" (Bihun v. AT&T Information Systems, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal. App. 4th
976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin v. Watkins Associated Indus.
(1993) 6 Cal. 4th 644, 664.)  The burden
is on the party seeking attorney fees to prove reasonableness of the fees. (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of
San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal. App. 4th 603, 615.) 
The Court has broad discretion in
determining the amount of a reasonable attorney's fee award which will not be
overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law,
or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.” (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008)
167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-94.)  The
Court need not explain its calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded
in detail; identifying the factors considered in arriving at the amount will
suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Industries Inc.
(2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-75.)
The Court notes that this case was
a breach of contract/promissory note case which presented a somewhat complex
issue regarding interest, as well as a Cross-Complaint seeking amounts which
would offset any judgment on the promissory note. In this regard, the Court
finds that time spent on the Cross-Complaint was related to the net recoverable
amount on the promissory note, and thus, apportionment is not required.
Such fees need not be apportioned when
incurred for representation of an issue common to both a cause of action for
which fees are permitted and one for which they are not. All expenses incurred
on the common issues qualify for an award. (See Reynolds Metals Co. v. Alperson
(1979) 25 Cal. 3d 124, 129-130 [158 Cal. Rptr. 1, 599 P.2d 83] [contractual
right to fee case].) When the liability issues are so interrelated that it
would have been impossible to separate them into claims for which attorney fees
are properly awarded and claims for which they are not, then allocation is not
required. (See Liton Gen. Engineering Contractor, Inc. v. United Pacific
Insurance (1993) 16 Cal. App. 4th 577, 588 [20 Cal. Rptr. 2d 200] [no
allocation of two parties' liability required].) 
 
(Akins v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co.
(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1127, 1133.)
The Court has reviewed the case
history spanning almost 5 years, considered the ruling summarized in the Court’s 27-page Statement of Decision, and
the billing records attached to the Declaration of Rouben Varozian as Exhibit 4.
The Court finds the hourly rate of $550/hour, and the $162,936 lodestar amount
to be reasonable. Defendant/Cross-Complainant did not file an opposition.
The motion for attorney’s fees is
GRANTED in the amount of 162,936.00.
