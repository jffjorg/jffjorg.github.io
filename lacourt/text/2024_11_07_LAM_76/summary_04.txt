And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to dismiss filed by Defendant Robert H. Roe. The motion was filed on April 9, 2024, and the judge has determined that the Plaintiff failed to serve the Defendant within the three-year period required by California Code of Civil Procedure, § 583.210. The judge has also noted that the Plaintiff never filed a proof of publication, despite having been granted an order to serve by publication on February 16, 2024. As a result, the judge has ordered the case to be dismissed with prejudice, meaning that the Plaintiff will not be able to re-file the lawsuit. The judge has also granted the Defendant's request to take judicial notice of the case information and register of actions from the court's online database.
