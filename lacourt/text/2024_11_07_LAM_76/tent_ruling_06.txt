[1] 
If the
arbitration agreement provides a method of appointing an arbitrator, that
method shall be followed. If the arbitration agreement does not provide a
method for appointing an arbitrator, the parties to the agreement who seek
arbitration and against whom arbitration is sought may agree on a method of
appointing an arbitrator and that method shall be followed. In the absence of
an agreed method, or if the agreed method fails or for any reason cannot be
followed, or when an arbitrator appointed fails to act and his or her successor
has not been appointed, the court, on petition of a party to the arbitration
agreement, shall appoint the arbitrator.
When a petition is made to the court to
appoint a neutral arbitrator, the court shall nominate five persons from lists
of persons supplied jointly by the parties to the arbitration or obtained from
a governmental agency concerned with arbitration or private disinterested
association concerned with arbitration. The parties to the agreement who seek
arbitration and against whom arbitration is sought may within five days of
receipt of notice of the nominees from the court jointly select the arbitrator
whether or not the arbitrator is among the nominees.
If the parties fail to select an
arbitrator within the five-day period, the court shall appoint the arbitrator
from the nominees.
