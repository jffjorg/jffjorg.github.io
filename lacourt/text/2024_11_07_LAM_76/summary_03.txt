And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case number 23STCV04345. The hearing date is November 7, 2024. The plaintiffs, Paul C. Armbruster and Penny Armbruster, have moved for leave to file a First Amended Complaint. However, the judge has denied this motion without prejudice, meaning it can be re-filed. The reason for the denial is that the plaintiffs' motion does not comply with the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324, which governs motions to amend pleadings. The judge requires notice of intent to appear at the hearing and notes that oral argument will not be permitted unless notice is given by a party seeking oral argument.
