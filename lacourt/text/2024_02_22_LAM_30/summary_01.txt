Here is a summary in English text:

The tentatively ruling denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The defendant, Encino Villas Condominium Association, Inc., argued that the plaintiff, Amir Golan, cannot establish a breach of duty, and that the plaintiff's damages were caused by his own actions, not the defendant's negligence. However, the court found that the defendant failed to meet its initial burden to show that the undisputed facts entitle it to summary judgment. The defendant's arguments were based on conjecture and opinion, rather than facts. The court also found that the defendant failed to establish reasonable investigation, weighing of costs and benefits, or exercise of discretion to select among means for discharging an obligation to maintain and repair common areas. As a result, the motion for summary judgment is denied.
