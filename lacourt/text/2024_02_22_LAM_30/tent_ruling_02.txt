Flynn vs. Huart,
et. al., Case No. 23STCV23121
 
Tentative Ruling
re:  Defendants’ Demurrer to Complaint;
Motion to Strike
 
Defendants Warren Huart and
Lancaster Audio, LLC (hereinafter “Defendants”), demurs to  the third and fourth causes of action alleged
in the Complaint.  The demurrer is
sustained with ten (10) days leave to amend. 
The motion to strike if moot.
 
The party against whom a complaint has been
filed may object to the pleading, by demurrer, on several grounds, including
the ground that the pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action and it cannot be determined how, or in what manner, Defendants
committed or can be liable for such cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc. §§
430.10(e) and 430.10(f).) 
“A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
complaint as a matter of law.”  (Durell
v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) “[T]he court gives
the complaint a reasonable interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded.”  (Ibid.)
A demurrer accepts as true all well pleaded facts and those facts of which the
court can take judicial notice but not deductions, contentions, or conclusions
of law or fact. (Fox v. JAMDAT Mobile, Inc. (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1068,
1078.) Although courts construe pleadings liberally, sufficient facts must be
alleged to support the allegations pled to survive a demurrer. (Rakestraw v.
California Physicians' Serv. (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.)  
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend
must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful
amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d
335, 349.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading
can be amended successfully. (Ibid.) “If there is any reasonable
possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to
sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation
Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245.)  
 
Third Cause of Action—Breach of
Fiduciary Duty 
The elements of a claim for breach
of fiduciary duty are (1) the existence of a fiduciary duty, (2) breach, and
(3) damages proximately caused by the breach. (Stanley v. Richmond
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1070, 1086.) As to the first element, the basic fiduciary
obligations are twofold: undivided loyalty and confidentiality. (Pierce v.
Lyman (1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1102, superseded by statute on different
issue as stated in Pavicich v. Santucci (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 382, 396.)
A fiduciary or confidential obligation or relationship can arise when
confidence is reposed by persons in the integrity of others, and if the latter
voluntarily accepts or assumes to accept the confidence, he or she may not act
to take advantage of the other’s interest without that person’s knowledge or
consent. (Oates v. City of Lincoln (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 25, 35.) 
Because of the vagueness of the
common law definition of the confidential relation that gives rise to a
fiduciary duty, and the range of the relationships that can potentially be
characterized as fiduciary, the “essential elements” have been distilled as
follows: (1) the vulnerability of one party to the other which (2) results in
the empowerment of the stronger party by the weaker which (3) empowerment has
been solicited or accepted by the stronger party and (4) prevents the weaker
party from effectively protecting itself. (Persson v. Smart Inventions, Inc.
(2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1161.) Vulnerability, in short, is the necessary
predicate of a confidential relation, and the law treats it as essential. (Ibid.)
 
The complaint alleges that “a
relationship of trust, confidence, integrity, and fidelity has been created
between Defendants, on the one hand, and Plaintiff, on the other hand.”
(Complaint, ¶ 32.) The complaint alleges that “[a]mong other things, Defendants
have acted as Plaintiff’s fiduciary by keeping valuable musical equipment on
behalf of and owned by Plaintiff and by taking the responsibility to maintain
the equipment in good condition and not sell the equipment.” (Complaint, ¶ 32.)
Defendants are alleged to have breached their fiduciary duties by “(1) failing
to maintain certain of Plaintiff’s equipment free from damage, [and] (2)
selling certain of Plaintiff’s equipment without Plaintiff’s permission.”
(Complaint, ¶ 33.)
 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has
not alleged sufficient facts to state a cause of action for breach of fiduciary
duty. Plaintiff has not alleged that Defendants accepted Plaintiff’s musical
equipment in the capacity of a fiduciary. A fiduciary duty does not arise based
on the mere entrustment of property to another. (City of Hope National
Medical Center v. Genentech, Inc. (2008) 43 Cal.4th 375, 387.) 
 
Fourth Cause of Action—Violation
of Penal Code § 496
“Every person who buys or receives any
property that has been stolen or that has been obtained in any manner constituting
theft or extortion, knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained, or who
conceals, sells, withholds, or aids in concealing, selling, or withholding any
property from the owner, knowing the property to be so stolen or obtained,
shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year,
or imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170.” (Pen. Code §
496(a).) “The elements of receiving stolen property under section 496(a) are
(1) stolen property; (2) knowledge that the property was stolen; and (3)
possession of the stolen property.” (People v. Coca (2023) 96
Cal.App.5th 451, 459.)  Pursuant to Pen.
Code Section 496(c) “[a]ny person injured by a violation of subdivision (a) or
(b) may  bring an action for three times
the amount of actual damages, if any, sustained by the plaintiff, costs of
suit, and reasonable attorney’s fees.” As a general rule, “statutory causes of
action must be pleaded with particularity.” (Lopez v. Southern Cal. Rapid
Transit Dist. (1985) 40 Cal.3d 780, 795.) 
Here, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not
stated a cause of action under Penal Code § 496 with particularity. Plaintiff
makes the conclusory allegation that “Defendants have obtained Plaintiff’s
musical equipment in a manner constituting theft or extortion and sold and/or
withheld, or aided in selling and/or withholding, the property from Plaintiff
(the owner), knowing the property to be maintained in a manner constituting
theft or extortion.” (Complaint, ¶ 38.) Plaintiff does not allege that the
musical equipment was stolen. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that
the motion to strike is moot.
