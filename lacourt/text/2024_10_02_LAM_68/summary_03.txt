Summary of Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The court is considering a motion to compel arbitration brought by the defendants, HEXPOL Holding, Inc. and Kirkhill Rubber Company, Inc. The motion is based on an arbitration agreement allegedly signed by the plaintiff, Johny Callejas, on January 24, 2023. The plaintiff denies ever signing the agreement and claims that the signature on the document is not his. The court finds that the hearsay objection to the declaration of Todd Mowery regarding the purported communications with Hector Murua, and the discrepancy in spelling and signature, are sufficient to render the execution of the agreement in question.

The court sets an evidentiary hearing for January 16, 2025, to determine the authenticity of the signature on the arbitration agreement. The parties may submit supplemental declarations only from the witnesses to the transaction, and any declaration of a handwriting expert. The court will not consider any new points and authorities or additional exhibits except in support of the limited and narrow consideration of the purported executed signature on the represented date in question.

The court will also set a follow-up hearing on the motion to compel arbitration following the evidentiary hearing, which is currently scheduled for February 18, 2025.
