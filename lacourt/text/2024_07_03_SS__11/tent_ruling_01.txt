TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s motion to compel
documents is granted.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a putative class action. 
Defendant provides video and audio technology for conventions,
conferences, and other events.  Plaintiff
used to work for Defendant.  He alleges
that Defendant subjected him and other current and former employees to multiple
wage-and-hour violations.
 
Here, Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant to comply with a purported
agreement to produce documents in response to document request numbers 11, 34,
and 35.
 
DISCUSSION
 
Document Requests
 
REQUEST FOR
PRODUCTION NO. 11:
 
All DOCUMENTS that
reflect work related business expenses paid to COVERED EMPLOYEES during the
COVERED PERIOD. 
 
REQUEST FOR
PRODUCTION NO. 34: 
 
All DOCUMENTS that
RELATE TO, reflect, refer to, or record requests from COVERED EMPLOYEES for
reimbursement of business expenses during the COVERED PERIOD. 
 
REQUEST FOR
PRODUCTION NO. 35:
 
. . . All DOCUMENTS
that RELATE TO, reflect, refer to, or record payments made to COVERED EMPLOYEES
for reimbursement of business expenses.
 
(Plaintiff’s
Separate Statement, pp. 1-2, underlining in original.)
 
Plaintiff
 
According to Plaintiff, “[t]he
only issue remaining” concerning document request numbers 11, 34, and 35 is
production of “reimbursement data.” 
(Motion to Compel, p. 2.)  He contends
the motion to compel should be granted because Defendant “has already agreed to
produce” the reimbursement data.  (Id. at
p. 3, capitalizing and bolding deleted.) 
He asserts that the agreement is reflected in the Court’s November 20,
2023 minute order.  (See id. at pp. 1,
3-4; see also id. at pp. 4-6 [claiming the reimbursement data is relevant].)
 
Defendant
 
Defendant contends the motion
should be denied for three reasons: 
 
* the November 20th
minute order does not “require Defendant to produce” the reimbursement data
(Opposition, p. 2; see also id. at p. 3); 
 
* “Plaintiff testified that he
cannot recall a time he used the Concur or Certify software to request
reimbursement and was not reimbursed” (id. at p. 2; see also id. at pp. 3-5);
and 
 
* “Plaintiff testified he does
not have any knowledge as to whether” any other employee “has had problems with
being reimbursed for business expenses” (id. at p. 2; see also id. at p. 5). 
 
Reply
 
In reply, Plaintiff claims:
 
* Defendant’s interpretation of
the November 20th minute order “renders the order superfluous” as to
document request numbers 11, 34, and 35 (Reply, p. 1, capitalizing and bolding
deleted);
 
* “the requested documents are
expected to reflect the non-payment of mileage by omission” (ibid.,
capitalizing and bolding deleted; see also id. at p. 2); and
 
* it is improper to use “a
discovery motion . . . to challenge the merits of Plaintiff’s claim” (id. at p.
2, capitalizing and bolding deleted; see also id. at pp. 3-4).
 
Analysis
 
Defendant’s first contention is
technically correct.  The plain language
of the November 20th minute order is silent regarding reimbursement
data:
 
. . . defendants
agreed to produce all relevant payroll records, pay stubs, or electronic
equivalent related to the 400 representative sample members identified by the
third-party administrator.  Defendants
agreed to produce the payroll records, the relevant employee handbook, and
policy manuals effective during the relevant class time frame by January 12,
2024. 
 
(11/20/23 Minute Order, p. 2; cf.
11/13/23 Joint Statement Re: Discovery Dispute, p. 3 [Plaintiff requesting
“class-wide time and payroll data, expense reimbursement data,
and any meal period or rest break waivers”], emphasis added.)  Admittedly, silence is different than an
express order or agreement and is insufficient to establish an agreement to
produce.
 
Nevertheless, the Court finds
that the motion to compel should be granted. 
The reimbursement data appears relevant and discoverable.  Indeed, Plaintiff’s complaint alleges a class
claim for failure to reimburse business expenses (see Complaint, ¶¶ 36-39), he
requested reimbursement data in the joint statement for the discovery
conference (see 11/13/23 Joint Statement Re: Discovery Dispute, p. 3), and he
needs the information to support his upcoming certification motion.  (See Motion, pp. 4-6.)  Simply put, the requested documents fall
within the scope of permissible class discovery.   
 
Defendant’s second and third
contentions do not change the result. 
This is a discovery motion, not a merits motion.  Typicality and adequacy are not at issue at
this stage, and the Court declines to prejudge them.
