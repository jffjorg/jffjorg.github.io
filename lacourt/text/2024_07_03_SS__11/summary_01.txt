And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel documents related to reimbursement of business expenses. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant, Encore Group (USA) LLC, subjected him and other employees to wage-and-hour violations while he worked there. The Plaintiff requests production of documents that reflect work-related business expenses paid to employees, requests for reimbursement of business expenses, and payments made to employees for reimbursement of business expenses. The Defendant opposes production of the reimbursement data, citing the November 20, 2023 minute order, which it claims does not require production of the data. The Judge finds that the reimbursement data is relevant and discoverable and grants the motion to compel. The Judge also declines to address the merits of the Plaintiff's claim, stating that this is a discovery motion and not a merits motion.
