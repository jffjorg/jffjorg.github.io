And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to bifurcate the trial without prejudice. The defendants had requested that the trial be split into two parts, focusing on liability and damages. The judge has decided that the trial judge, who will be handling the trial, should make the determination about whether bifurcation is warranted. The judge has also ruled that the defendants may submit a motion for bifurcation at the same time as motions in limine are filed, and that any oppositions to bifurcation can be filed at the same time as oppositions to motions in limine. The judge has ordered that the bifurcation briefing be included in the trial binders, along with any motions in limine filed in the case.
