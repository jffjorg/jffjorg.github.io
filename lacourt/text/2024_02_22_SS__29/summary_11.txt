And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the motion to continue trial filed by Pacific Steel Group and Hensel Phelps Construction Co. (Defendants). The trial date is advanced and continued to a date on or after August 19, 2024. The Court finds that good cause exists for the continuance due to the tardiness of the receipt of out-of-state medical and employment records of the Plaintiff. The Court also considers the proximity of the trial date, the availability of alternative means to address the problem, and the interests of justice. The motion is granted, and all deadlines are reset based on the new trial date.
