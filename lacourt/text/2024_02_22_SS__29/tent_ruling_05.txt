Background
On November 17, 2021, Plaintiff Norma Berry
(“Plaintiff”) filed the Complaint in this action against Mercy Eye Care
Medical, Inc. (“Defendant”), Miguel Unzueta, M.D., and Sandeep Khanna, M.D.,
and Does 1 through 25, asserting causes of action for (1) Medical Malpractice,
and (2) Lack of Informed Consent. Plaintiff alleges that she was injured over
the course of several eye surgeries from June 2020 to September 30, 2020. 
On January 17, 2024, Samuel O. Ogbogu filed this motion to be relieved as
counsel for Plaintiff. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
Counsel states a
material disagreement with the client as well as a failure by the client to
communicate provide a basis for the requested relief.
After considering
all of the evidence and argument presented, the Court grants the motion.  The Court finds that there is good cause for the
requested relief, and all substantive and procedural requirements are
satisfied.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is GRANTED.
The order is
effective upon the filing with the Court of a proof of service showing service
of the signed order on the client.
Moving counsel to give notice.
