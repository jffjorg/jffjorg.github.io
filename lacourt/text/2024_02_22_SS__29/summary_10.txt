And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion filed by Plaintiff Lisa L. Saver to continue the trial date. The motion was filed because Plaintiff was unable to serve the defendants with proof of service. Despite attempts to serve the defendants at the addresses listed in the Traffic Collision Report, Plaintiff was unsuccessful. The judge concluded that Plaintiff has shown good cause for a continuance to serve the defendants with proof of service and granted the motion. As a result, the trial date has been advanced and continued to February 6, 2025, and the final status conference and all deadlines have been reset based on the new trial date.
