And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the plaintiffs' motion for judgment on the pleadings, with leave to amend. The motion was filed in response to the defendant's answer, which contained a general denial of the allegations in the complaint. The judge has taken judicial notice of the complaint and answer, and has determined that the defendant's denial is improper because the complaint is verified. The judge has also found that the plaintiffs' motion is not frivolous, but rather meritorious, and has granted the motion. The defendant is given leave to amend its answer within 10 days of notice.
