And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendants, Har-South Marengo LLC, Har-South Marengo Manager LLC, and Har-South Marengo Avenue, LLC. The case arises from an alleged turnstile accident that occurred on November 13, 2017, at a building owned by the defendants in Pasadena, California. The plaintiff, Aaron Espinoza, filed a complaint against the defendants alleging causes of action for premises liability and general negligence.

The defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that they had no actual knowledge of the dangerous condition of the turnstile and therefore could not be held liable for the plaintiff's injuries. The court found that the defendants had met their initial burden of showing that there was no triable issue as to their actual knowledge of the dangerous condition, and therefore the burden shifted to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue existed. The court concluded that the plaintiff had not met this burden and therefore granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment.

The court noted that the defendants had no duty to inspect the property for dangerous conditions, as they were the landlords of a lease that commenced in the 1970s and did not have actual knowledge of the dangerous condition. The court also found that the plaintiff's exercise of its option to extend the lease did not change this result, as the extensions were deemed to be true extensions of the lease and not renewals or new lease agreements.
