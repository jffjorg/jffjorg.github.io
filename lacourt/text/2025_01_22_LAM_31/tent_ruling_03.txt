MOTION
FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS PURSUANT TO CIVIL CODE SECTION 1794(d)



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
David Aguilera
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant General
Motors, LLC
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            This is a Song-Beverly action relating to a 2018 Chevrolet
Silverado (the “Vehicle”).  On December 21,
2022, Plaintiff, David Aguilera, filed a Complaint against Defendant, General
Motors, LLC, after Defendant failed to repair the transmission of the Vehicle,
among other parts, pursuant to a Chevrolet Limited Warranty for the Vehicle.  
 
On July 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement of
Entire Case.
 
            On October
31, 2024, Plaintiff filed this Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs Pursuant to
Civil Code Section 1794(d) and concurrently filed a Memorandum of Costs.
 
            On December
6, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition.
 
            On January 14,
2025, Plaintiff filed a reply.
             
II.        DISCUSSION & LEGAL STANDARD 
 
            Plaintiff seeks a total award of $82,913.75,
consisting of $64,645 in attorneys’ fees, a 0.25 multiplier in the amount of $16,161.25,
and $2,107.50 in costs.  
 
On July 2, 2024,
the parties agreed to settle the matter.  (Barry Decl., ¶ 21, Ex. 3.) The settlement
provides for attorney fees by motion under Civil Code section 1794, subdivision
(d).  (Id.)¿ 
 
Civil Code section
1794, subdivision (d) provides:¿¿ 
 
(d) If the buyer prevails in an
action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover
as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and
expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined
by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with
the commencement and prosecution of such action.¿¿ 
 
(Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d).)¿¿ 
 
The settlement
provides Plaintiff is the prevailing party under the Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act for the purposes of this motion.¿ Accordingly, Plaintiff is
entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees as the prevailing party.¿ The
only matter at issue is the reasonableness of the requested fees and costs.¿¿ 
 
A.   
Attorney Fees 
 
The determination
of reasonable amount of attorney fees is within the sound discretion of trial
courts. (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095; Akins v.
Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1127, 1134.) “The
determination of what constitutes a reasonable fee generally ‘begins with the
‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate….’”¿ “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for comparable
legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court based on
factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent
to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys,
(4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”¿ (Graciano v. Robinson Ford
Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)¿ In setting the hourly rate
for an attorney fees award, courts are entitled to consider the rate of “‘fees
customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community for similar
work.’”¿ (Bihun v. AT&T Information Systems, Inc. (1993) 13
Cal.App.4th 976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other
grounds by Lakin v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644,
664.)¿ The burden is on the party seeking attorney fees to prove reasonableness
of the fees.¿ (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino
(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 615.)¿¿ 
 
It is settled “
‘that the determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is
committed to the discretion of the trial court .... [Citations.] The value of
legal services performed in a case is a matter in which the trial court has its
own expertise. [Citation.] The trial court may make its own determination of
the value of the services contrary to, or without the necessity for, expert
testimony.’ ” (PLCM Group v. Drexler, supra, 22 Cal.4th at p.
1096; accord, Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132 [the “ ‘
“experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional
services rendered in his court, and ... his judgment ... will not be disturbed
unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong” ’ ”].) 
 
1.     
Reasonable Hourly Rate¿¿¿ 
 
Plaintiff retained
The Barry Law Firm for this matter which involved work by attorneys David N.
Barry, Debora Rabieian, Logan G. Pascal, Elizabeth Quinn, Andrew P. Matera, and
C. Richard Lara billing at hourly rates of $675, $500, $400, $600, $500, and $350,
respectively.  (Barry Decl., ¶ 28.) 
The bulk of the work was completed by Mr. Barry, Ms. Rabieian, and Mr. Pascal.
 
¿ Defendant argues
the hourly billing rates for Plaintiff’s attorneys are unreasonable because
counsels’ declarations and own billing records from other cases shows that
Plaintiff’s counsel retroactively increased their historic hourly rates.  For instance, Mr. Barry’s declaration
indicated he increased his rate on January 1, 2024 to $675 per hour.  However, all of Mr. Barry’s work on this case
is billed at $675.  (See Barry Decl., Ex.
4.)  The same is true for Plaintiff’s
other attorneys.  Accordingly, Defendant
requests a reduction. 
 
¿ “A fee request
that appears unreasonably inflated is a special circumstance permitting the
trial court to reduce the award or deny one altogether.”  (Serrano v. Unruh (1982), 32 Cal.3d
621, 634.)
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel does not explain the discrepancies in the rates.  Accordingly, the court finds counsels’ rates
are unreasonably inflated.  The court
will reduce the award by $5,000.
 

Number
     of Hours Reasonably Expended¿¿ 

 
Plaintiff’s
counsel’s records reflect a total of 126 billable hours spent litigating this
matter. ¿(Barry Decl., Ex. 4.)  Defendant argues the hours billed is
unreasonable because Plaintiff’s Song-Beverly claims were joined with fraud
claims (for which attorney fees are not permitted).[1]  Defendant also objects to counsel’s
pre-representation billing, the amount of billing given Plaintiff’s counsel’s
use of template discovery, and excessive billing in connection to this fee
motion.  Defendant challenges specific entries.  
 
¿¿ “[I]t is the
burden of the challenging party to point to the specific items challenged
[within the moving party’s verified billing invoice], with a sufficient
argument and citations to evidence.¿ General arguments that fees claimed are
excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.”¿ (Lunada Biomedical v.
Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488.)¿¿¿¿ 
 
The court
appreciates that this case progressed towards trial.¿ Along the way, Plaintiff
served and responded to standard written discovery.  There was relatively little
law and motion practice.¿¿¿ 
¿ 
Moreover, there
was nothing particularly complex or unique about this case.¿ The issues
involved were applicable to other consumers’ vehicles, thereby triggering
economies of scale in terms of Plaintiff’s counsel’s efficiency in litigating
this type of lemon law case.¿ ¿ 
 
Considering these
facts, the court agrees that in some instances, the time quoted is excessive or
unreasonable under the circumstances.¿¿Accordingly, the court finds the total
amount of reasonable attorney’s fees in this case is $45,945.00.  This was
calculated by reducing the award by $5,000 due to the discrepancies in
counsel’s billable rate; declining to apply a multiplier given this
Song-Beverly case did not involve novel or complex issues of law; and, by reducing
Plaintiff’s counsels’ billing entries as follows:
