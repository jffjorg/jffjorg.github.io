MOTION
FOR DEFAULT JUDGMENT



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Monique Cooper, et al.
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION

 
On July 25, 2022, plaintiff Monique Cooper filed a Complaint
against defendants B. Ruth Allen, Leonard F. Delpit, and Charles S. Clark for
wrongful eviction.  The Complaint was
partially handwritten and included exhibits that were not clearly referenced in
the allegations.  Plaintiff was
self-represented at the time of the filing of the Complaint.  
 
On September 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file
the proposed First Amended Complaint (FAC).  On January 5, 2024, the court granted the
motion after taking the matter under submission and deemed the FAC filed as of
September 23, 2024.  The FAC adds Jayon
Levon as a plaintiff, B. Ruth Allen Trust as a defendant, and several causes of
action.
 
On December 10, 2024, plaintiffs Monique Cooper and Jayon
Levon (hereafter, Plaintiffs) filed this Motion for Default Judgment Against Defendants
Charles Clark, B. Ruth Allen, B. Ruth Allen Trust, and Leonard F. Delpit
(collectively, Defendants).
 
The motion is unopposed.
 
II.        DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiffs seek default judgment against Defendants in the
sum of $4,230,160, consisting of $161,290.00 in compensatory damages,
$483,870.00 in punitive damages, and $3,585,000.00 in civil statutory penalties.  The motion, however, is premature.  Default has not been entered against any defendant.  Plaintiffs must obtain Defendants’ default
before proving up a default judgment. 
Further, any request for default judgment must be made on Judicial
Council Form Civ-100.
 
III.      CONCLUSION 
 
            The motion
is DENIED.
 
Moving party to give notice.
