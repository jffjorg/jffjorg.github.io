And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for default judgment filed by the plaintiffs, Monique Cooper and Jayon Levon, against the defendants, B. Ruth Allen, B. Ruth Allen Trust, Charles S. Clark, and Leonard F. Delpit. The motion seeks a default judgment in the sum of $4,230,160. However, the judge finds that the motion is premature because default has not been entered against any defendant. The judge orders the plaintiffs to obtain a default from the defendants before seeking a default judgment. The judge also notes that the motion was unopposed and that the plaintiffs must use Judicial Council Form Civ-100 when requesting a default judgment. The motion is therefore denied.
