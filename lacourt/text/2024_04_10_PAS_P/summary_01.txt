And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the special motion to strike filed by the cross-defendants, which alleged that the cross-complaint was brought in bad faith and without a reasonable possibility of success. The court found that the cross-complaint was brought in furtherance of a protected activity, namely the exercise of the constitutional right of free speech and petition. The court also denied the cross-defendants' request for attorney's fees.

The court has also sustained the demurrer to the cross-complaint without leave to amend as to the first, second, and fourth causes of action. The court found that these causes of action were time-barred, as they were brought more than four years after the alleged breach of contract and more than six years after the last payment was due.

The court has sustained the demurrer to the cross-complaint with leave to amend as to the third cause of action for fraud. The court found that the cross-complaint failed to plead the essential elements of fraud with sufficient particularity.

The court has ordered the cross-complainant to file a first amended cross-complaint within 20 days of the ruling.
