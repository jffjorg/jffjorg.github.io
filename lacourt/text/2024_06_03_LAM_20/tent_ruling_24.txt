On February 20, 2024, Plaintiff Brison Hardin filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) against the County of Los Angeles for (1) FEHA disability discrimination, (2) FEHA retaliation, (3) FEHA failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation, (4) FEHA failure to engage in the interactive process, (5) FEHA failure to provide reasonable accommodations, (6) FEHA race discrimination, (7) “discrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and the California Constitution”, (8) “discrimination and wrongful discharge in violation of Labor Code § 233(c)”, (9) FEHA harassment, and (10) wrongful termination. DemurrerDefendant County of Los Angeles demurs to the entirety of the SAC for failure to state sufficient facts.  Specifically, Defendant argues that: “First, the SAC fails to adequately plead compliance with the Government Tort Claims Act. Second, the SAC fails to allege facts showing constructive termination or any other adverse employment action necessary to state a claim for discrimination and retaliation. Third, the SAC fails to plead the requisite hostile work environment to state a claim for harassment. Fourth, the SAC fails to plead any discrimination, retaliation, or harassment, and thus fails to state a claim for failure to prevent such acts. Fifth, because the SAC fails to plead facts showing the County denied Hardin a reasonable accommodation, both his failure to accommodate and failure to engage in the interactive process claims fail. Finally, the SAC fails to state a claim under the California Constitution or Labor Code section 233.”When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context, and “treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.)  “A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.”  (Hahn v. Mirda¿(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  It is error “to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment.”  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.¿(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)Government Tort Claim Defendant first argues that the seventh and eighth causes of action fail because Plaintiff did not plead compliance with the Claims Act.Under the Government Claims Act, all claims for money or damages against local public entities generally must be presented to those entities before formal legal action may be pursued. (Arntz Builders v. City of Berkeley (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 276, 279.)  The purpose of this general requirement is to provide public entities with notice of claims. (Ibid.)  Notice in turn provides the opportunity to settle just claims and to investigate and defend against unjust claims. (Id. at p. 298.)“[A] plaintiff may allege compliance with the claims presentation requirement in the Government Claims Act by including a general allegation that he or she timely complied with the claims statute.”  (Perez v. Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1237.)Here, the SAC pleads that Plaintiff “has satisfied Plaintiff’s administrative prerequisites with respect to these and all related filings.”  (SAC ¶ 13.)  This is too general as there is no direct assertion as to whether there has been compliance specifically with the Claims Act.Therefore, the Demurrer is sustained as to the seventh and eighth causes of action, with twenty days leave to amend. Adverse Action Defendant next argues that the SAC fails to plead a constructive discharge or other adverse action.  An adverse employment action is an action which “materially affect[s] the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.”  (Yanowitz v. L'Oreal USA, Inc. (2005) 36 Cal.4th 1028, 1054.)   “ ‘[A] mere offensive utterance or ... a pattern of social slights by either the employer or coemployees cannot properly be viewed as materially affecting the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment for purposes of [the FEHA]....’ ” (Ibid.)  “However, a series of alleged discriminatory acts must be considered collectively rather than individually in determining whether the overall employment action is adverse [citations] and, in the end, the determination of whether there was an adverse employment action is made on a case-by-case basis, in light of the objective evidence.”  (Jones v. Dep't of Corr. & Rehab. (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 1367, 1381.)  “[C]onstructive discharge occurs only when an employer terminates employment by forcing the employee to resign. (Turner, supra, 7 Cal.4th at p. 1244, 32 Cal.Rptr.2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022; see also Scott v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (1995) 11 Cal.4th 454, 468, 46 Cal.Rptr.2d 427, 904 P.2d 834.) A constructive discharge is equivalent to a dismissal, although it is accomplished indirectly. (Turner, supra, 7 Cal.4th at p. 1245, 32 Cal.Rptr.2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022.) Constructive discharge occurs only when the employer coerces the employee's resignation, either by creating working conditions that are intolerable under an objective standard, or by failing to remedy objectively intolerable working conditions that actually are known to the employer. (Id. at p. 1249, 32 Cal.Rptr.2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022.) We have said ‘a constructive discharge is legally regarded as a firing rather than a resignation.’ (Id. at p. 1245, 32 Cal.Rptr.2d 223, 876 P.2d 1022.)”  (Mullins v. Rockwell Internat. Corp.  (1997) 15 Cal.4th 731, 737.)The SAC indicates that Plaintiff was subject to harsher and more rigorous drills, false or unfair evaluations, pestering as to when he would return from medical leave, and a requirement to report weekly during leave “despite the Department having a date certain for his return”.  The Court believes that this is sufficient to plead an adverse action and that factual issues largely remain. Harassment Defendant next argues that “Hardin has not alleged a work environment so objectively hostile that it interfered with his employment.”To establish a prima facie case of harassment under the FEHA, the plaintiff must show that (1) she was a member of a protected class, (2) she was subjected to unwelcome harassment based on her protected status, and (3) the harassment unreasonably interfered with her work performance by creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.  (Thompson v. City of Monrovia (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 860, 876.)  “ ‘Harassment cannot be occasional, isolated, sporadic, or trivial; rather the plaintiff must show a concerted pattern of harassment of a repeated, routine or a generalized nature.’ ”  (Aguilar v. Avis Rent A Car System, Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 121, 131.)  In other words, the harassment must be “sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the condition of the victim’s employment and create an abusive environment,” as judged by the reasonable person belonging to the plaintiff’s protected class.  (Thompson, at p. 877.) Defendant’s argument lacks merit because the SAC plainly alleges that Plaintiff was routinely subject to demeaning and belittling comments because of his race, disability, and decision to take medical leave.  The Demurrer is overruled as to the harassment claim.  Derivative Claims The claims for failure to prevent misconduct survive given that the underlying claims for discrimination, retaliation, and harassment continue on. Interactive Process & Reasonable Accommodation Finally, Defendant argues that “Hardin cannot prevail on his interactive process claim because he has not identified any available accommodation the interactive process would have produced. He has not alleged facts showing a failure to provide a reasonable accommodation. To the contrary, he requested leave on three separate occasions in June, July, and August of 2021. (SAC ¶¶ 24-26, 30-32, 50.) Each time he was granted leave by the County. (Id. ¶¶ 28-29, 33, 50.) These admissions doom the claim.”The elements of a reasonable accommodation cause of action are (1) the employee suffered a disability, (2) the employee could perform the essential functions of the job with reasonable accommodation, and (3) the employer failed to reasonably accommodate the employee's disability.  (Nealy v. City of Santa Monica (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 359, 373.)  “The ‘interactive process' required by the FEHA is an informal process with the employee or the employee's representative, to attempt to identify a reasonable accommodation that will enable the employee to perform the job effectively. [Citation.] Ritualized discussions are not necessarily required.”  (Scotch v. Art Inst. of California (2009) 173 Cal. App. 4th 986, 1013.)This is not a summary judgment hearing or bench trial.  The SAC sufficiently alleges that Plaintiff needed more time on medical leave to cope with his mental disability and that Defendant unreasonably, prematurely, and without a good faith discussion sought to compel Plaintiff back to work. Summary In sum, the Demurrer is sustained as to the seventh and eighth causes of action, with twenty days leave to amend.  The Demurrer is otherwise overruled.   The Requests for Judicial Notice are granted.Motion to Strike Defendant also seeks to strike the SAC’s references to portions of the seventh cause of action.  The Motion to Strike is denied as moot given the ruling on the Demurrer.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
