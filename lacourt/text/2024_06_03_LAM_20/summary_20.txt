And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in an employment action. The defendant, Jobsource Downey, Inc., has filed a motion to withdraw its admissions to several requests for admission made by the plaintiff, Jasson Reyes Lopez. The defendant's counsel, Anahita Kouroshnia, prepared the responses to the requests, but the defendant did not thoroughly review them. The defendant now seeks to withdraw the admissions, citing mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The plaintiff argues that the defendant's communications with counsel are relevant to a fair adjudication of the withdrawal motion. The court has granted the defendant's motion to quash the plaintiff's subpoena for appearance and production of documents, citing the attorney-client privilege. The court has also granted the defendant's motion to withdraw its admissions, finding that the defendant's failure to thoroughly review its counsel's responses was excusable neglect. The court has set a trial date for April 28, 2025, and has declined to award costs.
