**Tentative Ruling**

In this employment action, Plaintiff Marilyn Kaye seeks to quash a deposition subpoena issued by her former employer, Grande Cheese Company. The subpoena seeks a wide range of documents, including personnel records, tax forms, and payroll records. The court finds that the subpoena is overbroad and unjustified, particularly with respect to Plaintiff's privacy rights. Although the defendant withdrew the objectionable portions of the subpoena and made a reasonable proposal, Plaintiff refused the proposal. The court grants the motion to quash the subpoena and awards reduced sanctions in the amount of $1,250.
