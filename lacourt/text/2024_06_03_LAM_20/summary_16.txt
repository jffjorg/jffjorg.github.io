"The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel and quash. In regards to the motion to compel, the Court has determined that the narrowly tailored request for admission discussed above might be relevant to credibility in this specific case. The Court will require further responses within 20 days. The request for production directed at Weifeng seeks all contracts signed on its behalf by Chen, which the Court believes is overbroad and can be better addressed through a request for admission or deposition inquiry. In regards to the motion to quash, the Court has granted the motion in part, limiting the financial documents for Weifeng to those dealing with AIIC/the restaurant. The Court has also ruled that the tax privilege does not extend to underlying notes, memoranda, workpapers, and other similar documents, which are not an integral component of the tax process."
