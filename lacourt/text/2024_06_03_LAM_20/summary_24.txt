And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The County of Los Angeles demurred to the second amended complaint filed by Brison Hardin, alleging that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to support the claims of discrimination, retaliation, and harassment. The court ruled that the complaint does not sufficiently plead compliance with the Government Tort Claims Act and that the claims for failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation must be dismissed. However, the court overruled the demurrer as to the harassment claim, finding that the complaint sufficiently alleges that Hardin was subject to unwelcome harassment based on his race, disability, and medical leave. The court granted the defendant's motion to strike the complaint's references to portions of the seventh cause of action, but denied the motion as moot given the ruling on the demurrer.
