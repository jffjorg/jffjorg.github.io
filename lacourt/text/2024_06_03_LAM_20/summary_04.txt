The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant, D&A Endeavors, Inc., will exclude the expert testimony of Dr. Shilpa Sayana, M.D., due to lack of foundation in science/medicine and lack of evidence of causation. Dr. Sayana is not board certified in certain medical fields and her opinions are based on incomplete and unreliable information. The court finds that Dr. Sayana's opinions are unsubstantiated and will therefore be excluded. The motion to exclude expert testimony is granted.
