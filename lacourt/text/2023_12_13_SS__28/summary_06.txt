And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge rules that the motion to be relieved as counsel is granted. The plaintiff's counsel, Daniel Moossai, has submitted the required forms and declared that there has been an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client communication. Despite making reasonable efforts to confirm the client's current address, counsel was unable to do so. The judge finds that the motion is justified and grants the request to be relieved as counsel. The order relieving counsel will be effective upon filing proof of service on the client.
