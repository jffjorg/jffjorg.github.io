PARTIES’ REQUESTS

LEGAL STANDARD 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), provides
in part: 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve
a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order,
or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall
be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken. . . .” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (b).) 
DISCUSSION 
The
clerk entered Defendant’s default on November 17, 2022.  Over nine months later, Defendant filed a motion
to set aside the default.  The motion is untimely. 
Defendant
argues that he was not aware of the default.  However, Plaintiff’s request for entry of
default contains a declaration of mailing which states that Plaintiff mailed a
copy of the request to Defendant on November 17, 2022. 
The
Court denies the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES Defendant Stephen John Binder’s motion to set aside the November
17, 2022 default. 
The
Court sets an OSC re: dismissal for failure to submit default judgment packet
on February 6, 2024 at 08:30 AM in Department 28 at Spring Street Courthouse. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
