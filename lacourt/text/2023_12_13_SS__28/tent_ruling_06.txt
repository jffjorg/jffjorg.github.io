BACKGROUND 
On
June 3, 2022, Plaintiff Elior Elady (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendants Vanessa Reynaldo, Dane Patrick Reynaldo, and Does 1-50 for motor
vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
November 16, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel, Daniel Moossai, filed a motion to be relieved
as counsel to be heard on December 13, 2023. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
COUNSEL’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff’s
counsel, Daniel Moossai, requests to be relieved as counsel. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, provides: 
“(a) Notice 
“A notice of motion and motion to be relieved as
counsel under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) must be directed to the
client and must be made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel-Civil (form MC-051). 
“(b) Memorandum 
“Notwithstanding any other rule of court, no
memorandum is required to be filed or served with a motion to be relieved as
counsel. 
“(c) Declaration 
“The motion to be relieved as counsel must be
accompanied by a declaration on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion
to Be Relieved as Counsel-Civil (form MC-052). The declaration must state in
general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section
284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure
section 284(1). 
“(d) Service 
“The notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and
the proposed order must be served on the client and on all other parties who
have appeared in the case. The notice may be by personal service, electronic
service, or mail. 
“(1)  If the
notice is served on the client by mail under Code of Civil Procedure section
1013, it must be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing that
either: 
“(A)   The
service address is the current residence or business address of the client; or 
“(B)   The
service address is the last known residence or business address of the client
and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after making
reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the motion to
be relieved. 
“(2)  If the
notice is served on the client by electronic service under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1010.6 and rule 2.251, it must be accompanied by a
declaration stating that the electronic service address is the client's current
electronic service address. 
“As used in this rule, ‘current’ means that the
address was confirmed within 30 days before the filing of the motion to be
relieved. Merely demonstrating that the notice was sent to the client's last
known address and was not returned or no electronic delivery failure message
was received is not, by itself, sufficient to demonstrate that the address is
current. If the service is by mail, Code of Civil Procedure section 1011(b)
applies. 
“(e) Order 
“The proposed order relieving counsel must be prepared
on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel-Civil (form
MC-053) and must be lodged with the court with the moving papers. The order
must specify all hearing dates scheduled in the action or proceeding, including
the date of trial, if known. If no hearing date is presently scheduled, the
court may set one and specify the date in the order. After the order is signed,
a copy of the signed order must be served on the client and on all parties that
have appeared in the case. The court may delay the effective date of the order
relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the
client has been filed with the court.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362.) 
DISCUSSION 
Counsel
submitted completed MC-051, MC-052 and MC-053 forms. Counsel has provided a
declaration stating “there has been an irremediable breakdown in the attorney -
client communication that stands in the way of effective representation.”  Counsel served Plaintiff by mail at his last
known address, return receipt requested, but could not confirm that the address
is current or locate a more current address for the client after calling the
client’s last known phone number or numbers, hiring a private investigator to locate
the client, and sending multiple emails to the client. 
The
Court grants the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS the motion of Plaintiffs’ counsel Daniel Moossai to be relieved as
counsel for Plaintiff Elior Elady. 
 Counsel will be relieved upon filing proof of
service on the client of the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel--Civil (Judicial Council form MC-053). 
Counsel
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Counsel
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
