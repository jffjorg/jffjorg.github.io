And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motions, oppositions, and replies filed in this case and has ruled as follows. The plaintiff, Andrea Kassandra Garcia, filed a lawsuit against the defendant, Stephen John Binder, and others for motor vehicle tort, general negligence, and negligence per se. The plaintiff filed a statement of damages and proof of service showing that the defendant was served with the summons and complaint. The clerk entered the defendant's default on November 17, 2022, and the defendant filed an answer on December 8, 2022. The defendant then filed a motion to vacate the default on August 30, 2023, which the plaintiff opposes. The judge finds that the motion is untimely, as it was filed over nine months after the default was entered. The judge denies the motion and sets a hearing to consider dismissal of the case if the defendant fails to submit a default judgment packet.
