Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has reviewed the petitions filed by Claimants April Magdelano and Noemi Magdelano, who were injured in a vehicle collision caused by Defendant Stephanie Gutierrez. The petitions are mostly complete, but there are some issues that need to be clarified. Specifically, the Petitioner, Maria Marquez, has made two separate requests for distribution of the settlement proceeds, but the petitions do not include the required attachment (Attachment 20b(4)). Additionally, the Petitioner has requested that the settlement proceeds be issued by check and deposited in a specific bank account. To resolve these issues, the Judge requires the Petitioner or their counsel to appear and clarify the intended form of distribution.
