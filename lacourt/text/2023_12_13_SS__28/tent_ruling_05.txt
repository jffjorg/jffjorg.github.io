 DISCUSSION:
 The
petitions are mostly complete.  However, in
each petition, Petitioner makes two separate requests for distribution.  In the MC350EX forms, Petitioner requests that the
total be delivered “to a parent of the minor” as specified in Attachment 20b(4),
but the petitions do not include Attachment 20b(4). In the MC-351 forms,
Petitioner requests that the total be issued by check for deposit in Logix
Credit Union, 18700 Ventura Blvd. Suite 110, Tarzana, CA 91356. 
Petitioner
or Petitioner’s counsel must appear to clarify the intended form of
distribution.
