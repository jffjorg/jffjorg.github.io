Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Black Pyramid, LLC, and the opposition and reply filed by the plaintiffs, Jane Doe and John Doe. The judge has denied Black Pyramid's motion for judgment on the pleadings on most of the substantive claims, including claims for strict liability under the dog-bite statute, premises liability, negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and loss of consortium. The judge has granted Black Pyramid's motion for judgment on the pleadings on Plaintiff Jane Doe's claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress with 30 days leave to amend. The judge has also denied Black Pyramid's motion for judgment on the pleadings based on the workers' compensation exclusive remedy, as Black Pyramid has not established that it was Jane Doe's employer.
