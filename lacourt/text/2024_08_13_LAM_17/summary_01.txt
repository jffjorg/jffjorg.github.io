And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants' motion to transfer the venue of the case from Los Angeles County to San Bernardino County. The defendants argued that venue is not proper in Los Angeles County because none of the defendants are residents of the county, the claims and occurrences arose in San Bernardino County, and all non-party witnesses reside in San Bernardino County and would be inconvenienced by having to travel to Los Angeles County. The judge agreed that the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice would be best served by transferring the venue to San Bernardino County, where the defendants and witnesses reside and where the plaintiff worked and the claims arose. The judge found that the defendants met their burden of showing that both convenience of witnesses and ends of justice would be promoted by the transfer, and granted the motion to transfer.
