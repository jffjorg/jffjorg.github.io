JANE DOE C.J. 
 
        
  vs.
 
DOE #1, et al. 
 


 Case
  No.:  22STCV35324 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: August 13, 2024



 
 
            Los
Angeles Unified School District’s motion for a stay is DENIED.
 
On 11/4/2022,
Plaintiff Jane Doe C.J. filed suit against Doe #1 (a public entity) and Doe #2
alleging personal injuries and damages from childhood sexual abuse. 
 
            On
7/18/2024, Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District’s (LAUSD) moved for a
stay of proceedings. 
 
Discussion 
 
            LAUSD
seeks a stay of proceedings pending resolution of the following pending writs: West
Contra Costa USD v. Superior Court (First District Case No. A16934); and Roe
#2 v. Superior Court (Second Appellate District, Div. 6, Case No. B334707).
 
            At
issue in both these cases is whether or not AB 218’s retroactive elimination of
tort claim presentation requirements runs afoul of the constitutional
prohibition against gifts of public funds. 
 
“Trial courts
generally have the inherent power to stay proceedings in the interests of
justice and to promote judicial efficiency.” (Freiberg v. City of Mission
Viejo (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1484, 1489.) Courts specifically have the power
to issue stays where another pending action will issue a ruling or
determination of an issue which will be dispositive to the stayed action. (See
Caifa Prof. Law Corp. v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. (1993) 15
Cal.App.4th 800.) 
 
In a demurrer
here, Defendant raised the very argument at issue in West Contra and Roe
#2. The Court was unpersuaded by Defendant’s argument at the time, and
overruled Defendant. However, the Court acknowledged that there was a lack of
guiding authority from the higher courts on this issue. 
 
While the
Court may have been inclined to grant a stay, Defendant indicated in reply that
on July 31, 2024, the First Appellate District, Division Five, of the
California Court of Appeal issued an opinion, certified for publication, in West
Contra Costa Unified School District v. Superior Court of Contra Costa County,
Appellate Case No. A169314. The Court of Appeal upheld the constitutionality of
AB218.
 
Defendant
argues a stay is still appropriate because a ruling in Roe #2 has not
been issued, and it is unclear whether parties will further appeal the West
Contra decision. In so arguing, Defendant is essentially asking the Court
to stay this action until every possible alternative has been exhausted for Defendant
to get the ruling it is hoping for. 
 
A stay would
have been warranted to allow clarification on a critical issue, i.e., the
constitutionality of AB218. Now, the Court of Appeal has spoken on this issue
and deemed it constitutional. It would not serve the interests of justice and
judicial efficiency to now delay Plaintiff’s entitlement to relief under that
statute. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, LAUSD’s motion for a stay is denied. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
