(collectively, Defendants), alleging: (1) failure to provide meal breaks; (2)

            On
7/16/2024, Defendants moved to transfer venue to the Civil Division of the San
Bernardino District, Superior Court of California, County of San Bernardino,
courthouse.
 
Legal Standard 
 
 Code of Civil Procedure
section 397 provides that
“the court may, on motion, change the place of
trial . . . [w]hen the convenience
of witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted by the change.” “A motion for a
change of venue, grounded upon the convenience of witnesses, rests in the
discretion of the trial court.” (Blossom v. Waller (1916) 30 Cal.App. 439, 441.) The party moving to change an action’s
venue has the burden of proving that both convenience of witnesses and
ends of justice will be thereby promoted. (Prewitt v. Prewitt (1954)
128 Cal.App2d 344, 346.) The motion must be accompanied by declarations that
establish a substantial factual basis for granting the motion based on
“convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice.” (Juneau v. Juneau (1941)
45 Cal.App.2d 14, 16.) 
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendants
argue that venue is not proper in Los Angeles County because: (1) none of the
defendants are residents of Los Angeles County, California (2) because
Plaintiff’s claims and the occurrences and transactions arose in San Bernardino
County, California; and (3) all nonparty witnesses reside in San Bernardino
County, California and it would be inconvenient for them to travel to Los
Angeles County.
 
            After
review, the Court agrees. 
 
Generally,
"[v]enue is determined based on the complaint on file at the time the
motion to change venue is made." (See Cholakian & Associates v.
Superior Court (2015) 236 CA4th 361, 367.)
 
Once a
defendant demonstrates that it is not a resident of the plaintiffs chosen
venue, "the burden is on the plaintiff to show that the case comes clearly
within one of the statutory exceptions to the general rule that actions are
triable in the place of the defendant's residence." (Archer v. Superior
Court of Humboldt County (1962) 202 CA2d 417, 420.)  Plaintiff does not dispute that all Defendants
and witnesses reside in San Bernardino County and this is where Plaintiff was employed,
other than to indicate Los Angeles is Defendant’s corporate address.
 
Actions are
triable in the county where the injury occurred. CCP §395(a). CCP section 395
states, in relevant part, "the superior court in the county where the
defendants or some of them reside at the commencement of the action is the
proper court for the trial of the action." CCP §395.
 
Here, all
Defendants reside in San Bernardino County. All of Plaintiff’s claims under the
Complaint arose during her employment in San Bernadino County. As such, all of
the nonparties witnesses that Defendants will call at trial reside and work in
San Bernardino County.
 
Accordingly,
the Court finds that the ends of justice and convenience of witnesses would be
best served if venue was transferred to San Bernadino County. (Blossom, supra, 30 Cal.App. at p. 441.) 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Defendants’ motion to transfer is granted. 
 
 It is
so ordered.
