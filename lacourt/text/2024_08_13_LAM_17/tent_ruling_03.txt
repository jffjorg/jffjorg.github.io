MICHAEL J. GELSKEY, et al. 
 


 Case
  No.:  24STCV02379
 
 
 Hearing Date:  August 13, 2024



 
 
Plaintiff’s motion for a
preliminary injunction is DENIED.
 
            On
1/30/2024, Plaintiff Linda Jie Cai, individually and as Trustee
of the Jie Cai Separate Property Trust, dated February 26, 2013, filed suit
against Michael J. Gelskey, Emily Gelskey, as individuals and as Co-Trustees of
the Gelskey Family Trust U/D/T February 18, 1999, alleging: (1) trespass; (2)
private nuisance; (3) negligence; (4) ejectment; (5) quiet title; (6)
declaratory relief; and (7) breach of governing documents. 
 
            On
5/28/2024, Plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction.
 
Discussion 

 
            Plaintiff
seeks an for an order and injunction requiring
adjoining landowner and Defendant Michael J. Gelskey to remove encroachments
from Plaintiff’s land installed without consent by Defendant, and consist of
the following: (1) a ficus tree; (2) assorted shrubbery and groundcover plants;
(3) supporting irrigation lines; and (4) supporting lights, with 20 days of
entry of the Court’s Order; ejecting Michael J. Gelskey from Plaintiff’s
property, located at 7186 Vista De Oro, La Verne, CA 91750, also known as
Assessor Parcel Number (APN) 8678-066-009. 
 
To obtain a
preliminary injunction, a moving party must show that it is likely to succeed
on the merits of its claims, that it will suffer irreparable harm if alleged
conduct is not enjoined, and that its entitlement to an injunction outweighs
any harm to the opposing parties. (Cal. Civ. Proc. § 526(a); Shoemaker v.
County of Los Angeles (1995) 37 Cal. App.4th 618, 624; Robbins v.
Superior Court (1985) 38 Cal.3d 199, 206.) 
California courts have recognized that injunctive relief is
extraordinary and should only be granted when the stringent requirements for
such relief are met. “The power to issue preliminary injunctions is an
extraordinary one and should be exercised with great caution and only where it
appears that sufficient cause for hasty action exists.” (West v. Lind
(1960) 186 Cal.App.2d 563, 565.) 
 
To justify
“the exercise of the rather extraordinary power to restrain defendant’s actions
prior to a trial on the merits,” a plaintiff must show a real and imminent
threat of “irreparable injury” if injunctive relief is not granted. (Tahoe
Keys Prop. Owners’ Ass’n v. State Water Res. Control Bd. (1994) 23
Cal.App.4th 1459, 1471.) An irreparable injury is typically “one for which
either (1) its pecuniary value is not susceptible to monetary valuation, or (2)
the item is so unique its loss deprives the possessor of intrinsic values not
replaceable by money or in kind.” (Jessen v. Keystone Sav. & Loan
Ass’n (1983) 142 Cal.App.3d 454, 457.) 
“If monetary damages afford adequate relief and are not extremely
difficult to ascertain, an injunction cannot be granted.” (Thayer Plymouth
Center, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp. (1967) 255 Cal. App. 2d 300, 306; see
also Doyka v. Superior Court (1991) 233 Cal. App. 3d 1134, 1136 (injunction
will not issue where “only money is involved”).
 
            After
review, the Court has insufficient evidence to conclude that imminent,
irreparable harm will result if Defendant is not ordered to remove various
plants, irrigation lines, and supporting lines. Moreover, Plaintiff has not
shown that any losses or harm to her property are neither susceptible to
monetary valuation or would result in losses which could not be replaced or
remedied. (Jessen, supra, 142
Cal.App.3d at p. 457.)  Given
that monetary damages could afford adequate relief, an injunction cannot be
granted. (Thayer, supra, 255 Cal. App.
2d at p. 306.) 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction is denied.  
 
It is so ordered.

TENATIVE RULING
 



LINDA JIE CAI, individually and as Trustee

  vs.
 
MICHAEL J. GELSKEY, et al. 
 


 Case
  No.:  24STCV02379
 
 
 Hearing Date:  August 13, 2024



 
Defendant
Gelskey’s motion to set aside entry of default is GRANTED.
 
On 1/30/2024,
Plaintiff Linda Jie Cai, individually and as Trustee of the Jie Cai
Separate Property Trust, dated February 26, 2013, filed suit against Michael J.
Gelskey, Emily Gelskey, as individuals and as Co-Trustees of the Gelskey Family
Trust U/D/T February 18, 1999, alleging: (1) trespass; (2) private nuisance;
(3) negligence; (4) ejectment; (5) quiet title; (6) declaratory relief; and (7)
breach of governing documents. 
 
On 4/22/2024, default was
entered against Defendant Michael J. Gelskey (Defendant or Gelskey).
 
Now, Gelskey moves to set
aside the entry of default. 
 
Discussion 
 
Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section 473, subdivision
(b) provides:
 
The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a
party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or
other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall
be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.
 
            Here,
default was entered on 4/22/2024, and Gelskey moved to set aside the entry of
default on 6/11/2024. Accordingly, Gelskey’s motion is timely.
 
            In
his motion, Gelskey explains that:
 
In the midst
of settlement negotiations, Defendant traveled to Buza, Tanzania for two weeks
for a long-awaited mission trip where he did charity work at the Valentines
Children’s Home orphanage. After returning to Baja California, Mexico, where
Defendant lives full time, Defendant flew out again to Europe. Nonetheless,
Defendant continued to communicate with Plaintiff’s counsel regarding
settlement. Towards the end of March, Defendant believed the parties had
reached a settlement in principle and even sent the settlement check while he
and Plaintiff’s counsel worked on finalizing the written settlement agreement.
When certain disputes arose with respect to the specific terms, Defendant
advised Plaintiff’s counsel that he would follow up after his counsel returned.
After ignoring Defendant’s emails for a week, Defendant was surprised to hear
from Plaintiff’s counsel that she had requested the Court to enter his default.
At that point, Defendant did not appreciate the nature of the legal documents
he received or the significance of entry of default. Nonetheless, Defendant
immediately retained counsel he had previously worked with, David Prince
(“Prince”), to take over the settlement negotiations. Unfortunately, after a
breakdown between him and Prince, Defendant was forced to hire new counsel.
After retaining new counsel, Schorr Law, Defendant promptly seeks to respond to
the lawsuit filed against him so that this case can be resolved on the merits.
Unfortunately, due to Defendant’s mistake, inadvertence, and/or excusable
neglect, the Court has already entered Defendant’s default.
 
            (Motion,
2: 17-3:5.) 
 
            After
review, the Court finds relief should be granted based on inadvertence and
excusable neglect. (Benjamin v. Dalmo Mfg. Co. (1948) 31 Cal. 2d 523,
527; Hodge Sheet Metal Products v. Palm Springs Riveriera Hotel (1961)
189 Cal.App.2d 652, 656.)
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Defendant Gelskey’s motion to set aside entry of default is
granted. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
