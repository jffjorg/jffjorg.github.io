And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion by the Govind Parties to stay proceedings and release levied funds. The Govind Parties have posted bonds in excess of $20.5 million and argue that a stay is mandatory given the amount of bonds posted and the fact that the Prashant Parties have not resolved the central question underlying the allegedly due payments. The Prashant Parties argue that the funds should not be released and that they should be held pending resolution of a dispute concerning the proper disposition of the funds. The court finds that the levied funds should be held until the dispute between the parties on the first bond is resolved, and grants the Govind Parties' motion in part, denying the release of the levied funds. The court orders the parties to work cooperatively towards an outcome that does not require court intervention.
