And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Amy Pham's Motion for Summary Judgment. The judge found that the motion was not properly served on the Plaintiff because the Plaintiff never submitted notice or manifestation of affirmative consent to receive electronic service. Additionally, the judge found that the Separate Statement accompanying the motion did not comply with the essential requirements for a Separate Statement, as it failed to describe any facts and did not identify each cause of action that is the subject of the motion. The judge cited various California laws and court rules to support this ruling, including Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6, Code of Civil Procedure section 437c(b)(1), and Rule of Court 3.1350(d).
