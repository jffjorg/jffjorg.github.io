CASE:                         Moayed Harb v. Ford Motor Company, et
al. 
 
CASE NO.:                 23STCV18736            
 
MOTION
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION (SET ONE)

 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff Moayed Harb 
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): Defendant Ford
Motor Company
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a lemon law action filed on August 8, 2023. Plaintiff purchased a
2019 Ford F150 equipped with a 10R80 transmission system which he alleges has a
series of known defects causing hesitation, shuddering, and shifting issues. 
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to requests for production propounded to Defendant Fort Motor
Company.
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production is DENIED as
untimely. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to requests for production propounded to Defendant Fort Motor Company.
 
Legal Standard
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (a), a court
may order a party to serve a further response to a demand for inspection when
the court finds that: “(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete[;] (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive[; or] (3) An objection in the response is without merit
or too general.”
 
The burden is on the moving party to “set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) These facts must also be set forth in a separate
statement filed by the moving party. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1345(c).) This
burden “is met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.” (TBG Ins.
Servs. Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)
 
Timeliness
 
A motion to compel further
responses to requests for production must be served “within 45 days of the
service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on
or before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the
responding party have agreed in writing.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
2031.310(c).) The 45-day requirement is mandatory and jurisdictional. (Sexton
v. Superior Court¿(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
Plaintiff propounded the Requests
for Production at issue on this motion to Defendant on December 18, 2023.
(Declaration of Tyson R. Smith ISO Mot. Exh. 6.) Defendant provided responses
on January 19, 2024. (Id. Exh. 4.) 45 days from January 19, 2024 was
March 4, 2024. However, this motion was filed and served on March 15, 2024,
eleven days after that deadline, and Plaintiff provides no indication that the
parties agreed to any specific later date in writing. The Court therefore lacks
jurisdiction to hear this motion. (Sexton v. Superior Court¿(1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production is
DENIED as untimely. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
