Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike brought by Defendant Bristol Central SPE, LLC. The Defendant demurred to the Complaint in its entirety, arguing that the Plaintiff, EMI, LLC, lacks standing to assert claims for breach of contract, fraudulent inducement, and declaratory relief. The Judge has sustained the demurrer, finding that the Plaintiff's Complaint does not state a cause of action.

The Judge has given the Plaintiff 30 days to amend the Complaint to either allege a basis for standing or to join the real party in interest as a Plaintiff. The Judge has also denied the Defendant's request for judicial notice of several documents.

The Defendant's Motion to Strike is moot because the demurrer has been sustained. The Judge has ordered that the Plaintiff shall have 30 days leave to amend the Complaint, and the Defendant shall be notified.
