STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for quiet
title and injunctive relief. Plaintiff contends that Defendant is fraudulently
claiming ownership of the property in which Plaintiff resides and which he
contends that he owns.
 
Defendant Amy Pham moves for
summary judgment. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Defendant Amy Pham moves for
summary judgment. 
 
            Defendant’s
proof of service states that this motion was served by electronic service on February
14, 2024. Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1010.6, an unrepresented party
may only be served by electronic service when express consent has been
manifested by either (1) serving notice on all parties and filing the notice
with the Court, or (2) by manifesting affirmative consent through electronic
means with the Court or its electronic filing service provider and providing
the party’s electronic address with that consent for the purpose of receiving
electronic service. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.6(c).) Plaintiff never submitted
any notice or manifestation of affirmative consent to receive electronic
service to the Court. For that reason alone, the Court would be inclined to
deny this potentially dispositive motion as improperly noticed. 
 
            Defendant’s
motion is also fatally deficient because the putative “Separate Statement of
Undisputed Material Facts” accompanying the motion fails to comply with essential
requirements for a Separate Statement. “The
separate statement serves two important functions in a summary judgment
proceeding:  It notifies the parties which material facts are at issue,
and it provides a convenient and expeditious vehicle permitting the trial court
to hone in on the truly disputed facts.”  (Collins v. Hertz Corp. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 64, 74.) Here, Defendant’s
Separate Statement purports to identify three “material facts,” but in truth
merely references three documents for which Defendant separately sought
judicial notice: a title deed bearing Defendant’s name, an unlawful detainer
judgment in a separate action, and the Court’s order in this action dismissing
Defendant U.S. National Bank. The Separate Statement does not describe any
facts which are evidenced by the cited documents, which defeats the purpose of
a Separate Statement. Moreover, Rule of Court 3.1350(d) requires that the
Separate Statement identify each cause of action that is the subject of the
motion and state the material facts claimed to be without dispute as to each
cause of action. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1350(d).) Defendant’s Separate
Statement fails to do so. 
 
The failure to provide a compliant
separate statement is, in the Court’s discretion, grounds for denial of the
motion. (Code Civ. Proc. § 437c(b)(1).) Moreover, appellate precedent has
consistently encouraged trial courts to require strict compliance with the
requirements for separate statements. (United Community Church v. Garcin (1991)
231 Cal.App.3d 327, 335 [superseded by statute on other grounds]; North
Coast Business Park v. Nielsen Construction Co. (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 22,
30-32.) As the Court of Appeal for the Fourth District bluntly stated this past
December, “[t]rial courts should not hesitate to deny summary judgment motions
when the moving party fails to draft a compliant separate statement.” (Beltran
v. Hard Rock Hotel Licensing, Inc. (2023) 97 Cal.App.5th 865, 876.) This
Court shall not hesitate.
 
Defendant’s Motion for Summary
Judgment is DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
