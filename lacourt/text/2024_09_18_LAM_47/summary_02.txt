```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production, citing that the motion was filed and served 11 days after the 45-day deadline. The plaintiff had propounded the requests for production on December 18, 2023, and the defendant provided responses on January 19, 2024. The judge found that the plaintiff failed to show good cause justifying the discovery sought, and therefore lacked jurisdiction to hear the motion. The judge noted that the 45-day requirement is mandatory and jurisdictional, and that the plaintiff provides no indication that the parties agreed to any specific later date in writing.
