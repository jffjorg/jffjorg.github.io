And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint (FAC) is overruled. The demurrer is based on the argument that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the one-year statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure Section 340.6. The plaintiff filed the action on August 7, 2023, and alleges that the statute of limitations began to run when the defendants ceased representing the plaintiff in the underlying action on June 24, 2022. The plaintiff also alleges that an agreement with the defendants to toll the statute of limitations for a year, until August 9, 2023, prevented the expiration of the statute of limitations. The defendants argue that the statute of limitations began to run on May 11, 2021, and expired a year later on May 11, 2022, rendering the tolling agreement null and void. The judge finds that the parties' competing versions of events manifest a factual dispute that cannot be resolved at the pleading stage, and therefore the demurrer is overruled. The judge also grants the defendants' motion to strike the prayers in the FAC for punitive and exemplary damages, as the FAC lacks allegations of intentionally fraudulent, malicious, or oppressive conduct that would support the award of punitive or exemplary damages. The plaintiff is directed to serve and file a second amended complaint by September 28, 2024.
