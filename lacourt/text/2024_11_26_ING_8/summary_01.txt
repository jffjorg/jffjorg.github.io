Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Ford Motor Company to the Sixth Cause of Action for Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment in the case Ayline A. Amirayan v. Ford Motor Company, et al. The Judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, finding that the Plaintiff's allegations of fraudulent concealment are insufficient.

The Judge's analysis is based on the Supreme Court's recent decision in Rattagan v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (2024) 17 Cal.5th 1, which held that a plaintiff must allege two essential elements to establish a cause of action for fraudulent concealment: (1) the elements of the fraud cause of action must be established independently of the parties' contractual rights and obligations, and (2) the allegedly tortious conduct must have exposed the plaintiff to a risk of harm beyond the reasonable contemplation of the parties when they entered into the agreement.

The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's allegations do not meet these requirements, as they do not allege any accident or injury resulting from the transmission defect, and the allegedly tortious conduct is within the contemplation of the parties when they entered into the warranty agreement.

The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff's reliance on the precedent in Dhital v. Ford Motor Co. (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1391-1392 is unpersuasive, and that the Supreme Court's recent decision in Gilead Tenofovir Cases (2024) 98 Cal.App.5th 911, 949 does not support the Plaintiff's position.

The Judge therefore sustains the demurrer without leave to amend, finding that the Plaintiff's Sixth Cause of Action for Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment is insufficient.
