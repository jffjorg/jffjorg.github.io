MOVING
PARTY: Plaintiffs
Haroon Temueri; and Shaheen Temueri (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)
RESPONDING
PARTY: Defendant
Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (“Defendant”)
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order compelling further responses to Plaintiffs’ Requests for Production of
Documents (“RFPs”), Set One. Plaintiffs further request monetary sanctions to
be imposed against Defendant and its counsel in the amount of $3,541.75.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is denied. The Court imposes sanctions against Plaintiffs’ counsel in
the amount of $300.00.
 
Plaintiffs are reminded to review the 5/3/19 First Amended
General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil. When e-filing
documents, parties must comply with the “TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS” which are set
forth at page 4, line 4 through page 5, line 12 of the Court’s 5/3/19 First
Amended General Order Re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil (particularly bookmarking
declarations and exhibits). (Cal. Rules of Ct., rule 3.1110(f)(4).) Failure to
comply with these requirements in the future may result in papers being rejected,
matters being placed off calendar, matters being continued so documents can be
resubmitted in compliance with these requirements, documents not being
considered and/or the imposition of sanctions.
 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiffs bring this action under the Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act (Civil Code § 1790 et seq.) for a vehicle they purchased on or
around 7/24/22, for which Defendant issued the manufacturer’s express warranty.
(Compl. ¶¶ 5, 11.) Plaintiffs allege that “the Subject Vehicle was delivered to
Plaintiffs with serious defects and nonconformities to warranty and developed
other serious defects and nonconformities to warranty including, but not
limited to the Vehicle abruptly shutting off and jerking, and check engine
warning light illumination, and other serious nonconformities to warranty” (Id.
at ¶ 12.) Plaintiffs allege that on 10/8/22, they presented the vehicle for
repair at an authorized repair facility, defendant Mercedes-Benz of Valencia
(“MB Valencia”), but the defects remain. (Id. at ¶¶ 13–15, 84.) 
 
On 1/6/23, Plaintiffs filed their complaint, alleging
against Defendants the following causes of action: (1) Violation of
Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty; (2) Violation of Song-Beverly
Act – Breach of Implied Warranty; (3) Violation of Song-Beverly Act §
1793.2(b); and (4) Negligent Repair (against MB Valencia).
 
On 4/27/23, Plaintiffs served their Requests for Production
of Documents, Set One, on Defendant. (Decl. of Michael Saeedian ¶ 5.) On 5/31/23,
Defendant served its objection-only responses thereto. (Id. at ¶ 8.)
 
On 9/7/23, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to compel further
responses to his RFPs, Set One. On 11/30/23, Defendant filed its opposition. On
12/6/23, Plaintiff filed his reply.
 
ANALYSIS
 
California law requires a responding party to respond to
each request for production of documents with either a statement of compliance,
a representation that the party lacks the ability to comply, or an objection to
the demand. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.210, subd. (a).) 
 
If the response includes an objection to the demand in
part, it must also include a statement of compliance or noncompliance as set
forth above. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.240, subd. (a).) Additionally, the
response must (1) identify the particular
document that falls within the category of the
request to which the objection is being made, and (2) expressly set forth the
extent of, and specific ground for, the objection. (Id., subd. (b).) A propounding party may move
for an order compelling further response to a discovery request if it decides
that “an objection in the response is without merit or too general.” (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2031.310, subd. (a).)
 
Here, Plaintiffs seek to compel additional responses to their
first set of RFPs in full, arguing that Defendant failed to provide any
responsive documents.
 
A.   
Meet and Confer 
 
A motion to compel further discovery responses must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration stating “facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2031.310, subd. (b)(2); 2016.040.) 
 
Here, Plaintiffs’ counsel declares that on 8/21/23, he sent
Defendant’s counsel a meet and confer letter raising the issues set forth in
the instant motion, but received no substantive responses. (Saeedian Decl. ¶ 10.) The
Court finds that counsel has satisfied the preliminary meet and confer
requirement under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (b)(2). 
//
//
B.    
Timeliness
 
“A
motion to compel further response … [must] be made within 45 days of the
service of the response.” (Standon Co. v Superior Court (1990) 225
Cal.App.3d 898, 902.) “Unless notice of this motion is given within 45 days of
the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or
on or before any specific later date to which the demanding party and the
responding party have agreed in writing, the demanding party waives any right
to compel a further response to the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310, subd.
(c).)
 
Here,
Plaintiffs argue that the instant motion is timely because Defendant failed to
provide verified responses. (Pls. Mot. 8:26–9:1, citing Golf & Tennis
Pro Shop, Inc. v. Superior Court (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 127, 135 “If
responses are not verified, the clock cannot begin to run.”) “In addition,
Defendant MBUSA counsel contended that the case was stayed pending the outcome
of its motion. It is estopped from contending the case was not stayed for
purposes of opposing this Motion in order to argue that it is not timely.” (Id.
at 9:2–4.)
 
Defendant
argues in opposition that Plaintiffs’ reliance on Golf & Tennis is
misplaced  because there, the Court’s
ruling was based on discovery responses containing both objections and
substantive responses, whereas here, Defendant served objection-only responses
which need not be verified. (Def.’s Opp. 4:9–19.) The Court agrees, and finds
that Golf & Tennis is inapplicable here, where Defendant served
objection-only responses, because such responses do not require verification.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.250.)
 
In
reply, Plaintiffs maintain that their motion is timely, arguing that the 45-day
time limit began on 7/28/23, which they argue was the deadline for Defendant to
provide discovery responses. (Pls.’ Reply 3:24–27.) Plaintiffs base their
argument on the assumption that discovery was stayed pending the Court’s ruling
on Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration, filed on 4/28/23 and denied on
6/26/23. (Ibid.) The Court disagrees, and notes that Plaintiffs provide
no legal authority to support a finding that absent a Court order, discovery
was stayed pending the outcome of Defendant’s motion to compel arbitration, nor
any support for a finding that the statutory deadline to bring a motion to
compel further responses is extended based on these circumstances.
 
The
Court therefore finds that the latest date on which Plaintiffs were authorized
to bring the instant action was 7/19/23, which is 45 days after 5/31/23, when
Defendant served its objection-only responses to Plaintiffs’ RFPs. (Code Civ.
Proc. § 2030.300, subd. (c).)¿As Plaintiffs filed and served the instant motion
on 9/7/23, 51 days past their statutory deadline to do so, the Court finds that
Plaintiffs have therefore waived their right to compel a further response to
their RFPs. Even if, assuming arguendo the Court were to accept Plaintiffs’
contention that discovery was stayed pending the outcome of Defendant’s motion
to compel arbitration, Plaintiffs filed the instant motion 74 days after the
Court’s ruling, therefore the motion would nevertheless be untimely. Accordingly,
the motion is denied.

C.   
Sanctions 
 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction … against any
party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to
compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310, subd.
(h).) 
 
Here, Plaintiffs request sanctions in the total amount of $3,541.75
to be imposed on Defendant and its attorney. In opposition, Defendant requests
that the Court impose $1,100.00 in monetary sanctions against Plaintiffs and/or
their counsel. This amount includes: (1) $800.00 in attorney time for drafting
Defendant’s opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion; and (2) an anticipated $300.00
reviewing Plaintiffs’ reply and preparing for and attending the instant hearing.
(Decl. of Donna Hooper ¶ 12.)
 
In denying the instant motion, the Court finds it
reasonable to award Defendant sanctions against Plaintiffs in the amount of $300.00.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is denied. The Court imposes sanctions against Plaintiffs’
counsel in the amount of $300.00.
