BACKGROUND
On November 5, 2020, Plaintiff Adrianne Pearson filed this
trip and fall negligence action against Defendant Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.
On February 21, 2024, Defendant filed a Motion to Compel
Nonparty David Vesco, M.D. to Comply with the Subpoena. On February 27, 2024,
Dr. Vesco responded to the Subpoena with an Affidavit of No Records.
On April 4, 2024, Defendant filed the instant Motion to
Compel Further Responses to Deposition Subpoena for Production of Business
Records Issued to Non-Party David Vesco, M.D. No opposition has been filed.
On May 20, 2024, the Court heard the instant motion and
continued the hearing for Defendant to provide additional briefing. Defendant
filed a supplemental brief on May 24, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Personal service of any deposition subpoena is effective to
require a deponent who is a resident of California to: personally appear and
testify, if the subpoena so specifies; to produce any specified documents; and
to appear at a court session if the subpoena so specifies. (CCP § 2020.220(c).)
CCP § 2025.480(a) provides that “[i]f a deponent fails to
answer any question or to produce any document, electronically stored
information,¿or tangible
thing under the deponent's control that is specified in the deposition notice
or a deposition subpoena, the party seeking discovery may move the court for an
order compelling that answer or production.” Unlike
CCP § 1987.1, CCP § 2025.480
also includes a time limit. If a nonparty disobeys a deposition subpoena, the
subpoenaing party may seek a court order compelling the nonparty to comply with
the subpoena within¿60 days¿after completion of the¿deposition record. (CCP § 2025.480(b); Unzipped Apparel, LLC v. Bader (2007) 156 CA4th
123, 127.) The deposition record is “complete” either on the date documents are specified for production or on
the date objections are served. (Board of Registered Nursing v. Sup.Ct.
(Johnson & Johnson) (2021) 59 CA5th 1011, 1032-1033.)
A motion to compel production of documents described in a
deposition notice must be accompanied by a showing of “good cause”—i.e.,
declarations containing specific facts justifying inspection of the documents
described in the notice. (CCP § 2025.450(b)(1))
“A written notice and all moving papers supporting a motion
to compel an answer to a deposition question or to compel production of a
document or tangible thing from a nonparty deponent must be personally served
on the nonparty deponent unless the nonparty deponent agrees to accept service
by mail or electronic service at an address or electronic service address
specified on the deposition record.” (CRC Rule 3.1346.)
A separate statement is required for motions to compel
further responses to a demand for inspection of documents or tangible things.
(CRC Rule 3.1345(a)(3).)
DISCUSSION
Defendant moves to compel further responses to the
deposition subpoena for production of business records issued to non-party
David Vesco, M.D. 
On July 27, 2022, Defendant issued a Deposition Subpoena for
Production of Business Records to the Custodian of Records for David Vesco,
M.D. (the "Subpoena.") On August 8, 2022, Array effectuated service
on Dr. Vesco. (Lopez Decl., ¶5; Exh. 2A.) The Subpoena requested records from
November 9, 2008 to the present. (Lopez Decl., ¶6.) The Subpoena commanded
production of records to the Deposition Officer (Array) by August 26, 2022.
(Lopez Decl., ¶ 7.)
On February 27, 2024, Dr. Vesco responded to the Subpoena
with an Affidavit of No Records. (Lopez Decl., ¶13, Exh. 6.)  Defendant now indicates that informal
production of records related to Plaintiff’s treatment was sent via e-mail.
After Defendant received the informal production, counsel requested Dr. Vesco
also provide the records to the deposition subpoena officer and provide an
affidavit of records confirming the production is complete. To date, Dr. Vesco
has not complied with either request. (See Supp. Brief.) 
Based on the foregoing, it appears that Dr. Vesco is in
possession of the records Defendant seeks, and the records should be produced
as there is good cause and no objection has been made, thus Dr. Vesco must
produce these records to the deposition officer. 
Defenant also seeks sanctions against Dr. Vesco for misusing
the discovery process. The Court declines to award sanctions as Dr. Vesco is a
non-party and some production has been made, albeit informally. 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is GRANTED. Sanctions are
denied. 
Defendant is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
