And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the defendant's motion to compel further responses to the deposition subpoena for production of business records issued to non-party David Vesco, M.D. The defendant had issued a subpoena for production of business records related to the plaintiff's treatment, and Dr. Vesco responded with an affidavit stating that he had no records. However, the defendant has since received informal production of some records, but Dr. Vesco has not complied with the subpoena's request for formal production. The court finds that Dr. Vesco is in possession of the records sought and must produce them as there is good cause and no objection has been made. The court also declines to award sanctions against Dr. Vesco for misusing the discovery process, as he is a non-party and some production has been made. The court orders the defendant to give notice of this ruling.
