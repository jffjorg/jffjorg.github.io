The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a protective order to prevent the discovery of her medical records. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant's conduct, including harassment and discrimination, caused her to suffer psychological and physical injuries. The defendant seeks to discover medical records related to the plaintiff's claimed injuries to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination. The judge finds that the defendant has a legitimate interest in discovering medical records related to the plaintiff's disability and that the records are relevant to the plaintiff's cause of action for disability discrimination. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's privacy interests in her medical records are reduced because she has placed her medical condition at issue in the action. The judge concludes that the defendant's subpoena of medical records is justified and that the plaintiff's motion for a protective order is denied.

**English Text Summary:**

This tentative ruling addresses Plaintiff Tamika Youngblood's motion for a protective order to prevent Defendants from accessing her medical records. The ruling denies the motion.

The Judge acknowledges Plaintiff's right to privacy regarding her medical information. However, because Plaintiff's Complaint alleges both physical and psychological injuries stemming from Defendants' actions, her medical history is considered relevant to the case. Specifically, the Judge notes that Plaintiff's allegations of disability discrimination, based on her claim of a retinal detachment, necessitate review of her medical records. 

The Judge finds that Defendants have a legitimate interest in obtaining these records to investigate Plaintiff's claims.  The Judge also determines that the subpoenas requesting medical records from 2011 to the present are appropriately limited in scope.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Tamika Youngblood's motion for a protective order to prevent the discovery of her medical records. The Plaintiff had argued that the Defendant's subpoena for her medical records violated her privacy rights, but the judge found that the Defendant had a legitimate interest in seeking the records to prove its defense in the lawsuit.

The judge also found that the Defendant's need for discovery outweighed the Plaintiff's privacy interests in this case. The judge ordered that the Defendant's deposition subpoenas be served on the medical providers listed in the subpoenas, and that the Plaintiff's motion for a protective order be denied.

Summary:
The tentative ruling denies Plaintiff's motion for a protective order to preclude the discovery of Plaintiff’s medical records. The court finds that the burden, expense, or intrusiveness of discovering Plaintiff’s medical records does not clearly outweigh the likelihood that the information sought will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The court also finds that Defendants have shown good cause to seek medical records related to Plaintiff's claimed injuries and disability, which are directly relevant to the case. Plaintiff's privacy rights are acknowledged, but the court balances these rights against Defendants' need for the medical records and finds that the latter outweighs the former.
