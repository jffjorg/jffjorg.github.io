And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a protective order to prevent the discovery of her medical records. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant's conduct, including harassment and discrimination, caused her to suffer psychological and physical injuries. The defendant seeks to discover medical records related to the plaintiff's claimed injuries to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination. The judge finds that the defendant has a legitimate interest in discovering medical records related to the plaintiff's disability and that the records are relevant to the plaintiff's cause of action for disability discrimination. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's privacy interests in her medical records are reduced because she has placed her medical condition at issue in the action. The judge concludes that the defendant's subpoena of medical records is justified and that the plaintiff's motion for a protective order is denied.
