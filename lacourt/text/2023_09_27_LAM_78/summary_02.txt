And here is a brief English-text summary:

The Judge has denied the County of Los Angeles's motion for summary judgment in this case. The case involves claims of negligence, premises liability, and professional negligence against the County related to the treatment of a minor, Christopher Lopez Jr., who suffered cardiac arrest during a CT scan at Olive View-UCLA Medical Center. The County argued that its employees' conduct fell within the standard of care and that Lopez's injuries were not caused by its employees' conduct. However, the Judge found that there was a triable issue of material fact regarding the County's employees' conduct during the CT scan and that the County failed to meet its burden of showing that its employees were not incompetent or unfit. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment was denied.
