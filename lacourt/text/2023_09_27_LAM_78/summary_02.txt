The case involves claims of negligence, premises liability, and professional negligence against the County related to the treatment of a minor, Christopher Lopez Jr., who suffered cardiac arrest during a CT scan at Olive View-UCLA Medical Center. The County argued that its employees' conduct fell within the standard of care and that Lopez's injuries were not caused by its employees' conduct. However, the Judge found that there was a triable issue of material fact regarding the County's employees' conduct during the CT scan and that the County failed to meet its burden of showing that its employees were not incompetent or unfit. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment was denied.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The County of Los Angeles has moved for summary judgment in this case, alleging that it complied with the standard of care at all times and that no act or omission of the County was a substantial factor in causing the minor plaintiff's injuries. The County relies on expert testimony from Dr. David Barcay, a licensed physician, who states that the County's staff complied with the standard of care during Lopez's admission and resuscitation.

The judge denies the County's motion for summary judgment, finding that there is no evidence of whether the County's employees' conduct during the CT scan fell within the standard of care. The judge also finds that the County failed to provide evidence of the CT technician's training or fitness for his position, and that there is no evidence showing whether the County's employees' conduct caused Lopez's injuries.

The judge also denies the County's motion for summary judgment on the ground of negligent hiring, finding that there is no evidence that the County knew or should have known that hiring the employee created a particular risk or hazard, and that the County failed to show that the employee's conduct was the proximate cause of Lopez's injuries.
