```

Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge grants the Defendant's motion to quash the service of process, citing lack of jurisdiction due to ineffective service. The Plaintiff failed to prove that it made a good faith effort or proceeded with reasonable diligence to personally serve the Defendant or its agent for service of process. Additionally, the Plaintiff did not attach a declaration of diligence stating the actions taken to attempt personal service. The Judge declines to award sanctions to the Defendant, as there is no evidence that the Plaintiff acted in bad faith. The case is dismissed, and the Plaintiff is prohibited from serving the Defendant with the summons and complaint.
