Background
            This
case arises from Plaintiff Judy Oh (Plaintiff) purchasing a bag of a popular
line of rice cakes (the rice cakes) manufactured by Defendant Wehah Farm, Inc
dba Lundberg Family Farms (Defendant). Plaintiff claims that Defendant has
falsely represented the quantity of product in each of the rice cakes’ package,
which leads consumers to believe they are receiving more product than what is
actually contained within the package. (Compl., ¶ 12.) Specifically, Plaintiff
alleges that the rice cakes’ packaging contains “nonfunctional slack-fill.”
“Nonfunctional slack-fill is the empty space in a package that is filled to
substantially less than its capacity for reasons other than” those enumerated
in the statute. (See Bus. & Prof. Code § 12606.2(c).)
            On
April 10, 2024, Plaintiff Judy Oh filed a complaint against Defendant Wehah
Farm, Inc dba Lundberg Family Farms, alleging causes of action for (1) common
law fraud; and (2) violation of the California Consumers Legal Remedies Act.      
            On
September 27, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion for judgment on the
pleadings (MJOP). 
            On
October 17, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition.   
            On
October 23, 2024, Defendant filed a reply.
 
Legal
Standard
A motion for judgment on the pleadings is
the functional equivalent to a general demurrer.  (Lance Camper Mfg.
Corp. v. Republic Indemnity Co. of Am. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 194,
198).  Like demurrers, motions for judgment on the pleadings challenge the
legal sufficiency of the allegations, not their veracity.  (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994). Any defects must
either appear on the face of the pleading, or else be taken by judicial
notice.  (Bezirdjian v. O'Reilly (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 316,
321-22).  The parties’ ability to prove their respective claims is of no
concern.  (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th
995, 99.)  Though the Court must accept the allegations of the complaint
and answer as true (Gerawan Farming, Inc. v. Lyons (2000) 24 Cal.4th
468, 515), it will not do so for “conclusions of law or fact, opinions,
speculation, or allegations contrary to law or [judicially noticed] facts…” (Stevenson
Real Estate Servs., Inc. v. CB Richard Ellis Real Estate Servs., Inc.
(2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1219-20). 
 
Meet and Confer
A motion for
judgment on the pleadings must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
demonstrating an attempt to meet and confer in person or by telephone, at least
five days before the date a motion for judgment on the pleadings is filed.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 439.)  
Here,
Defendant’s counsel sent Plaintiff’s counsel a meet and confer letting setting
forth the substance of the instant motion. (Altura Decl., ¶ 2.) Defendant’s
counsel then received an email from Plaintiff’s counsel stating that
Defendant’s meet and confer letter was reviewed and they would oppose
Defendant’s motion for judgement on the pleadings. (Id. at ¶ 5.) Thus,
the meet and confer requirement is met. 
            
Discussion
            Here, Defendant seeks a judgement on
the pleadings on the grounds that (1) Plaintiff fails to plausibly allege Defendant
made an actionable misrepresentation or that a reasonable consumer would be
misled by the product packaging in this case and therefore her Consumer Legal
Remedies Act (CLRA) claim fails; (2) Plaintiff fails to allege she actually
relied or justifiable relied on the size of the product packaging, given the
undisputed accuracy of the product label; (3) Plaintiff lacks standing to seek
injunctive relief because she does not allege she is at risk of future harm. 
 
Whether
Plaintiff has standing to pursue injunctive relief
            Defendant contends that Plaintiff
lacks standing to assert a claim for injunctive relief because she is now
informed about the number and weight of rice cakes, and therefore cannot be
misled about that information in the future. (MJOP, page 12.) Thus, according
to Defendant, Plaintiff cannot plausibly allege that she is at risk of future
harm. 
“[S]tanding requires that (1) the
plaintiff suffered an injury in fact ... (2) the injury is fairly traceable to
the challenged conduct, and (3) the injury is likely to be redressed by a
favorable decision.” (Mazza v. Am. Honda Motor Co. (9th Cir. 2012) 666
F.3d 581, 594-95.) 
However, courts have come to diverging
conclusions as to whether plaintiffs have standing to seek injunctive relief
despite their knowledge that a product’s packaging contains slack-fill. Some
courts have taken the approach that a plaintiff, like the Plaintiff here, does
not have standing for injunctive relief when the plaintiff is aware of the
product’s representation and its misleading nature. (See Romero v. Flowers
Bakeries, LLC (N.D. Cal. May 6, 2015) No. 14-CV-05189-BLF, 2015 WL 2125004,
at *7; Anderson v. The Main Celestial Grp., Inc. (N.D. Cal. 2015) 87 F.
Supp. 3d 1226, 1233-35; Ham v. Hain Celestial Grp., Inc. (N.D. Cal.
2014) 70 F. Supp. 3d 1188, 1196; Garrison v. Whole Foods Mkt. Grp., Inc.
(N.D. Cal. June 2, 2014) No. 13-CV-05222-VC, 2014 WL 2451290, at *5; Cordes
v. Boulder Brands USA, Inc. (C.D. Cal. Oct. 17, 2018) No. CV 18-6534 PSG
(JCX), 2018 WL 6714323, at *4.) Specifically, these courts held that plaintiffs
“who were misled by deceptive food labels lack standing for injunctive relief
because there is no danger that they will be misled in the future.” (Ham,
70 F. Supp. 3d at p. 1196.) 
Other courts allow plaintiffs to seek
injunctive relief even with the knowledge of the package’s alleged
misrepresentation. (Lanovaz v. Twinings North America, Inc. (N.D. Cal.
Jan. 6, 2014) No. C-12-02646-RMW, 2014 WL 46822, at *9-* 10; Escobar v. Just
Born Inc. (C.D. Cal. June 12, 2017) No. CV1701826BROPJWX, 2017 WL 5125740,
at *6; Barrett v. Optimum Nutrition, No. CV 21-4398-DMG (SKX) (C.D. Cal.
Jan. 12, 2022) 2022 WL 2035959, at *5.) 
While there is conflicting case law
surrounding whether a plaintiff in similar circumstances as Plaintiff can
pursue injunctive relief, the Court concludes Plaintiff is unable to seek
injunctive relief. Here, Plaintiff alleges in the complaint that “Plaintiff
intends to purchase the Product in the future but cannot reasonably do so
without an injunctive relief order from the Court ensuring Defendant’s
packaging, labeling, and filling of the Product is accurate and lawful, at
which point Plaintiff will reasonably be able to rely upon Defendant’s
representations about the Product.” (Compl., ¶ 4.) Plaintiff has alleged that
she could be harmed in the future if the packaging of the rice cakes continues
in its current form. However, Plaintiff cannot plausibly be misled in the
future because the rice cakes’ packaging displays the number of rice cakes in
each package. (MJOP, page 4.) 
In Cordes, the Court held that the
plaintiff is unable to seek injunctive relief because the “[p]laintiff is on
notice about potential underfilling, [and] he could easily determine the number
of pretzels in each package before making a future purchase by simply reading
the back panel, which lists the number of servings in each bag and the number
of pretzels in each serving.” (Cordes, supra, 2018 WL 6714323, at *4.)
In Jackson, the Court held that the plaintiff “now knows she can
ascertain the amount of cereal she is buying by looking at the label, she has
not shown any likelihood she will be deceived in the future.” (Jackson v.
Gen. Mills, Inc. (S.D. Cal. Sept. 23, 2019) No. 18CV2634-LAB (BGS), 2019 WL
4599845, at *5.) Similarly here, Plaintiff is able to ascertain the precise
number of rice cakes in the package by looking at the label. The nutrition
label of the rice cakes’ packaging states that each package is about five (5)
servings, and each serving is thirteen (13) rice cakes. (MJOP, page 4.) Thus,
Plaintiff is on notice that the packaging contains about 65 rice cakes. 
The case here is dissimilar to Davidson v. Kimberly-Clark Corp. (9th Cir. 2018) 889 F.3d 956. There, the Court
held that a plaintiff who alleged that a defendant falsely advertised its wipes
as “flushable” had standing to seek injunctive relief because the plaintiff
could not otherwise determine whether the wipes were flushable without opening the
packages of wipes and trying to flush them. (Id. at p. 969-70.) In Barrett,
the Court held that the plaintiff “cannot tell how much empty space is in the
container without first purchasing the Product and opening it. As discussed
above, though the Product Label discloses the net weight and number of
servings, this does not necessarily provide the reasonable consumer a
meaningful metric for how much powder is in the container.” (Barrett v.
Optimum Nutrition, supra, 2022 WL 2035959, at *5.) Unlike the plaintiffs in
Davidson and Barrett, Plaintiff here can readily determine the
number of rice cakes contained in the packaging by looking at the nutritional
label. Plaintiff does not need to first open the packaging to discover the
contents of the rice cakes’ packaging because the nutritional label expressly
states that there are about 65 rice cakes in each package. 
Therefore, the Court grants
Defendant’s motion with respect to the prayer for injunctive relief. 
 
Whether the complaint alleges actionable representation 
An actionable representation
may be (1) “an affirmative representation,” or an omission if the omitted fact
is (2) “contrary to a material representation actually made by the defendant”
or (3) “is a fact the defendant was obliged to disclose.” (Shaeffer v.
Califia Farms, LLC (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 1125, 1136; Lazar v. Superior Court
(1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 638 (elements of common law fraud).) 
Here, Plaintiff sufficiently
alleges an actionable misrepresentation. Plaintiff alleges that the packaging
itself misrepresents the amount of product (rice cakes) contained within that
packaging. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that “Defendant falsely represents
the quantity of product in each of the Product’s opaque package. The size of
each package leads reasonable consumers to believe they are purchasing a
package full of product when, in reality, consumers are actually receiving
significantly less than what is represented by the size of the package.”  (Compl., ¶ 12; see Escobar, supra, 2017
WL 5125740, at *11 [“Plaintiff does not admit that the box at issue lacks a
false statement or misrepresentation. To the contrary, Plaintiff maintains that
the size of the Products’ box itself misrepresents the amount of Product
contained within the box. Plaintiff alleges that the Products’ boxes mislead
consumers as to the amount of candy contained therein.”]; Costa v. Reliance
Vitamin Co., Inc. (N.D. Cal. Apr. 18, 2023) 2023 WL 2989039, at *6 [“Taken
together, [slack-fill allegations] [are] sufficient to plead an intentional
misrepresentation claim]; Stewart v. Kodiak Cakes, LLC (S.D. Cal. 2021)
537 F. Supp. 3d 1103, 1139 [noting the plaintiff’s allegation that “the CLRA
claim premised on slack fill is viable because product size is a
misrepresentation.”].) 
 
Whether a Reasonable Consumer would be misled 
Plaintiff's claim under the
CLRA is governed by the “reasonable consumer test.” (Williams v. Gerber
Prods. Co. (9th Cir. 2008). 552 F.3d 934, 938.) Under the reasonable
consumer test, Plaintiff must show that “members of the public are likely to be
deceived” by slack-fill in the rice cakes’ package. (Ibid.; Consumer
Advocates v. Echostar Satellite Corp. (2003) 113 Cal. App. 4th 1351, 1360.)
“[T]hese laws prohibit ‘not only advertising which is false, but also
advertising which [,] although true, is either actually misleading or which has
a capacity, likelihood or tendency to deceive or confuse the public.’” (Kasky
v. Nike, Inc. (2002) 27 Cal. 4th 939, 951 (quoting Leoni v. State Bar
(1985) 39 Cal. 3d 609, 626.) 
Whether the defendant's
practices are deceptive is usually a question of fact that is not appropriate
for determination at the motion to dismiss stage. (Williams, 552 F.3d at
938–39.) Indeed, the Ninth Circuit has made clear that granting a motion to
dismiss on this question will only be appropriate in “rare situation[s].” (Id.
at p. 939; Samet v. Procter & Gamble Co. (N.D. Cal. June 18, 2013)
2013 WL 3124647, at *9 [“[T]he amount of slack-fill expected by the reasonable
consumer is a debatable factual question that is inappropriate to resolve at
the motion to dismiss stage.”].)
Defendant contends that “an
ordinary consumer acting reasonably under the circumstances would not be misled
about the number of rice cakes in the Product because the number of rice cakes
is indicated on the product label. An ordinary consumer would also palpate and
shake the package to assess the amount of slack fill.” (MJOP, page 9.)
Plaintiff alleges in the complaint that “[e]ven if consumers had a reasonable
opportunity to review, prior to the point of sale, other representations of
quantity, such as net weight or serving disclosures, they did not and would not
have reasonably understood or expected such representations to translate to a
quantity product meaningfully different from the size of the package.” (Compl.,
¶ 13.) The Court finds that this is not one of the “rare situation[s]” where it
is appropriate to determine at the motion for judgment on the pleadings stage
whether a reasonable consumer would not be misled. Like Cordes, the
Court now finds it “at least plausible that a consumer could be deceived by a
package filled with [65 percent air], regardless of whether the number of [rice
cakes] in the package is displayed on the ingredient list.” (Compl., ¶ 3; Cordes,
supra, 2018 WL 6714323, at *7; see Izquierdo v. Mondelez Int'l, Inc.
(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 26, 2016) No. 16-CV-04697 (CM), 2016 WL 6459832, at *7 [“Whether
a reasonable consumer would think to shake, squeeze, or manipulate the Candy
box, and whether that reasonable consumer would actually be able to feel the
existence of slack-fill, are questions of fact that are inappropriate for
resolution at the motion to dismiss stage.”].) 
Plaintiff’s allegations on whether a reasonable consumer would be misled
are sufficient to survive the instant motion.
 
Whether Plaintiff has alleged actual or justifiable reliance 
            Defendant argues
that Plaintiff has failed to plead both actual reliance and justifiable
reliance because (1) she is a “tester” and (2) “no reasonable consumer would
assume a package of rice cakes is full to the brim without looking at any other
information on the package, such as the product label.” (MJOP, page 11.) 
            Firstly, the
claim that Plaintiff is a tester is immaterial to the instant motion. (Ibarra,
supra, 660 F. Supp. 3d at p. 922 [“There is nothing facially implausible
about [a consumer’s] dual motives—consumers are allowed to have multiple
reasons behind their purchasing decisions.”]; Cordes, supra, 2018 WL
6714323, at *2 [“[W]hile Plaintiff’s allegation that he purchased the Product
in part to determine whether it was lawfully filled suggests that he may have
suspected that the package contained a significant amount of slack-fill, it
does not demonstrate that he knew for certain about the amount of slack-fill
before he purchased and opened the product.”].) Plaintiff specifically alleged
that she “was genuinely interested in consuming and enjoying the product, and
did so – with disappointment that the package was mostly empty.” (Compl., ¶
17.) 
            Secondly, Plaintiff's
allegations give rise to an inference that she would not have purchased the
Product had she known about the amount of slack-fill in advance, or, at
the very least, that he would not have paid as much for it. (Compl, ¶ 4
[“Plaintiff understood the size of the package and product label to indicate
that the amount of product contained therein was commensurate with the size of
the package, and would not have purchased the Product, or would not have paid a
price premium for the Product, had plaintiff known that the size of the package
and product label were false and misleading.”]; Id. at ¶ 45
[“Defendant’s packaging of the Product was a material factor in Plaintiff’s
decisions to purchase the Product. Based on Defendant’s packaging of the
Product, Plaintiff reasonably believed that Plaintiff would receive more
product than actually received. Had Plaintiff known the truth of the matter,
Plaintiff would have not have purchased the Product.”].) These allegations are
sufficient to “give rise to a plausible inference that Plaintiff relied on the
slack-fill in making [her] purchase.” (Cordes, supra, 2018 WL 6714323,
at *7.) 
 
The Court
therefore GRANTS Defendant’s motion only as it pertains to Plaintiff’s prayer
for injunctive relief. Because Plaintiff cannot claim that Plaintiff is
entitled to injunctive relief, Plaintiff is not given leave to amend.  
.The Court DENIES
the rest of Defendant’s motion
It is so
ordered.
