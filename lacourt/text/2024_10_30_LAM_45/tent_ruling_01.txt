The Court GRANTS  in part Plaintiff’s motion to quash Defendant’s deposition subpoena seeking  Plaintiff’s medical records from Kaiser Permanente.              Plaintiff’s  request for monetary sanctions is DENIED.              AFI’s  request for monetary sanctions is DENIED.   Background             This  is a disability discrimination and wrongful termination matter.               On  July 14, 2021, Plaintiff Eliza Suruchlian (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against  Defendants Answer Financial, Inc.; Answer Financial; The Allstate Corporation;  Allstate; and Sharday Bailey. Plaintiff alleged causes of action for (1)  disparate treatment based on disability and/or perceived disability; (2)  failure to provide reasonable accommodation; (3) failure to engage in the  interactive process; (4) retaliation; (5) failure to do everything reasonably  necessary to prevent discrimination and retaliation from occurring; (6)  violation of Government Code § 12945.2(a) of the California Family Rights Act;  (7) retaliation for taking/requesting CFRA; (8) wrongful termination in  violation of public policy; and (9) intentional infliction of emotional  distress.                  On  May 31, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to quash Defendant Answer  Financial, Inc.’s (AFI) deposition subpoena for Plaintiff’s medical and billing  records from Kaiser Permanente (Kaiser).              On  October 17, 2024, AFI filed its opposition.               On  October 24, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.   Legal  Standard Where the witness whose deposition is  sought is¿not¿a party, a¿subpoena¿must be served to compel his or her  attendance, testimony, or production of documents. (Code Civ. Proc., §  2020.010, subd. (b).) A deposition subpoena may request (1) only the attendance  and testimony of a deponent, (2) only the production of business records for  copying, or (3) the attendance and testimony, as well as the production of  business records.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.020.)  The court, upon  motion or the court’s own motion, “may make an order quashing the subpoena  entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon those terms or  conditions as the court shall declare, including protective orders. ” (Code  Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (a).)       In addition, “the court may make any  other orders as may be appropriate to protect the person from unreasonable or  oppressive demands, including unreasonable violations of the right of privacy  of the person.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (a).)  “A deposition  subpoena that commands only the production of business records for copying  shall designate the business records to be produced either by specifically  describing each individual item or by reasonably particularizing each category  of item…” (Code Civ. Proc., §2020.410, subd. (a).)    Separate Statement  A motion to  quash production of documents at a deposition must be accompanied by a separate  statement setting forth the particular documents or demands at issue and the  factual and legal reasons why production should not be compelled. (CRC, rule  3.1345(a)(5).)¿When no separate statement is filed with a discovery motion, the  matter may be ordered off calendar.¿(BP Alaska Exploration, Inc. v. Sup. Ct.  (1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 1240, 1270.)  On May 31, 2024,  Plaintiff filed a Separate Statement in support of her instant motion to quash.  However, AFI states that Plaintiff’s Separate Statement is procedurally  defective as it does set forth separately the text of each request on which  Plaintiff is moving, any objection, and a statement setting forth the legal  reasons as to why the request should be quashed. (See (CRC, rule 3.1345(c).)  The Court agrees with AFI and notes that Plaintiff’s Separate Statement does  not comply with California Rules of Court rule 3.1345(c). Though, the Court  will still address Plaintiff’s motion on the merits.               Discussion             Here, Plaintiff seeks to quash AFI’s  deposition subpoena in its entirety, or in the alternative limit them to records  pertaining to any emotional distress from January 1, 2019 to present where the  chief complaint/reason for visit was for either stress, anxiety, for  depression, subject to a first peek agreement.  On May 6, 2024, AFI served its deposition  subpoena upon Kaiser seeking Plaintiff’s medical records from January 1, 2014,  to the present. (Motion, Exhibit 1.) Specifically, AFI seeks the following  records:  1.       Any and all WRITINGS REFERRING OR  RELATING TO professional services rendered by any medical doctor, osteopathic  doctor, physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, radiologist, nurse, physical  therapist, occupational therapist, hospital or other health care provider,  including YOU, in the care, treatment and/or evaluation of MS. SURUCHLIAN.  2.       Any and all WRITINGS REFERRING OR  RELATING TO testing and/or evaluation of MS. SURUCHLIAN's physical/ medical/  psychological condition which YOU relied upon, referenced and/or utilized in  any manner, which was performed, administered, requested and/or ordered by any  medical doctor, osteopathic doctor, physician psychiatrist, psychologist,  radiologist, nurse, physical therapist, occupational therapist, hospital or  other health care provider. 3.       Any and all doctor’s notes or other  WRITINGS authorizing OR RELATING TO medical leave of absence for MS.  SURUCHLIAN. 4.       Any and all WRITINGS REFERRING OR  RELATING TO any accommodations MS. SURUCHLIAN needs to work and/or any medical  restrictions on MS. SURUCHLIAN's ability to work. 5.       Any and all patient history notes  or medical charts REFERRING OR RELATING TO MS. SURUCHLIAN. 6.       Any and all WRITINGS REFERRING OR  RELATING TO examinations/ tests conducted, procedures performed and/or  diagnoses made in connection with MS. SURUCHLIAN. 7.       Any and all WRITINGS REFERRING OR  RELATING TO medications administered, prescriptions written, referrals of MS.  SURUCHLIAN to any health care providers, or care treatments administered and/or  ordered in connection with MS. SURUCHLIAN. 8.       Any and all WRITINGS REFERRING OR  RELATING TO communications between YOU and MS. SURUCHLIAN, including but not  limited to any attorney or anyone representing or acting as an agent for MS.  SURUCHLIAN. (Id.)     Privacy         Plaintiff  contends that AFI’s deposition subpoena infringes on her privacy rights.  “The California Constitution guarantees to  individuals the right of privacy.”  (Grafilo v.   Wolfsohn (2019)  33 Cal.App.5th 1024, 1033.)  The party asserting a privacy right must  establish a legally protected privacy interest, “an objectively reasonable  expectation of privacy in the given circumstances, and a threatened intrusion  that is serious.” (Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531,  552.) If this standard is met, requesting party must then show that the  requested documents are “directly relevant” to the litigation. (Tylo v.  Superior Court (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1387, citing Britt v.  Superior Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 858-859.)¿¿¿¿  A person has a  right of privacy to information contained in their medical records.  (Grafilo,  supra, 33 Cal.App.5th at p. 1034.)  “The right to privacy, however, is  not absolute.”  (Ibid.)  “Potential invasions of privacy are  ordinarily evaluated by balancing the privacy interest at stake and the  seriousness of the threatened invasion with the strength of legitimate and  important countervailing interests.”  (Ibid.)  “On occasion [a  party’s] privacy interests may give way to the opponent’s right to a fair  trial. Thus, courts must balance the right of civil litigants to discovery  relevant facts against the privacy interests of persons subject to discovery.”   (John B. v. Superior Court, (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1177,  1199.)  Where a plaintiff places their medical condition at issue, such  plaintiff has lowered their expectation of privacy.  (Ibid.)   A party seeking to limit discovery must show good cause for such  limitation.  (Valley Bank of Nevada v. Superior Court (1975) 15  Cal.3d 652, 657.)    As stated above,  Plaintiff has a right to privacy in her medical records. (John B., supra, 38  Cal.4th at p. 1198.) However, Plaintiff contends that the scope  of AFI’s deposition subpoena is too overbroad and is not limited to conditions  put at issue by Plaintiff, specifically “stress, anxiety, and depression”  related to her emotional distress claim. Plaintiff argues that AFI is engaging  in a “fishing expedition” into Plaintiff’s medical records, some of which would  expose private information unrelated to the issues of the current litigation.  AFI contends  that its subpoena is appropriate in scope because it is “limited in time and  scope, requesting eight categories of information directly relevant to the  issues in this case.” (Opposition, page 13.) Specifically, Plaintiff claimed  her verified responses to AFI’s form interrogatories that her disability  consists of medical and physical symptoms in addition to mere emotional  distress, such as alleged depression, panic attacks, and insomnia. (Ordway  Decl., Ex. 5, Nos. 204, 212.2.) AFI also argues that it is permitted to  discover whether Plaintiff had other forms of emotional distress that existed  prior to her termination, and whether she had other stressors that caused  emotional distress unrelated to the termination, for which AFI would not be  liable. (Ibid.)  The Court agrees  with Plaintiff that the requests at issue are not sufficiently limited to  adequately protect Plaintiff’s privacy interests. While AFI has a legitimate  interest in Plaintiff’s medical records related to her claimed conditions, AFI  has not properly demonstrated that its requests are appropriately restricted in  scope so as not to obtain records completely unconnected to the case. AFI  cannot speculate as to the possibility that some portion of the records might  be relevant to the issues of this action, thereby being permitted to delve into  the entirety of Plaintiff’s medical records without adequate restrictions. (Davis  v. Superior Court (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1008, 1017-20 [“Mere speculation as  to the possibility that some portion of the records might be relevant to some  substantive issue does not suffice” for showing direct relevance as to private  information sought in discovery].) And while AFI limited the requests to  January 1, 2014 to the present, AFI has not explained why AFI would need records  spanning six (6) years prior to Plaintiff’s termination (even prior to the  start of Plaintiff’s employment with AFI) is directly relevant other than  potentially “identifying possible alternative stressors that may be responsible  for her alleged emotional distress.” (Opposition, page 13.) The notion that  there may be a “connection” between Plaintiff’s alleged distress and potential  other stressors that would be revealed in Plaintiff’s past medical records is  not grounds for the type of privacy-right infringement that AFI seeks. (Huelter  v. Superior Court. (1978) 87 Cal. App. 3d 544, 549; Boler v. Superior  Court (1986) 201 Cal.App.3d 467, 472   [“[R]elevancy in right of privacy cases seems to be governed by a more  stringent standard of ‘direct relevance,’ apparently to prevent a searching for  only tangentially pertinent sensitive information.”].) The documents  that AFI seeks concern a broad array of medical records, some of which are not  at issue in the litigation and are not limited to the identified conditions  that Plaintiff has put at issue. (Vinson v. Superior Court (1987) 43  Cal.3d 833, 841-42 [“Plaintiff is not compelled, as a condition to entering the  courtroom, to discard entirely her mantle of privacy.”].) For example, Request  No. 2 seeks all writings related to Plaintiff’s physical/ medical/  psychological condition which was used by Kaiser, and which was performed,  administered, requested and/or ordered by any “medical doctor, osteopathic  doctor, physician psychiatrist, psychologist, radiologist, nurse, physical  therapist, occupational therapist, hospital or other health care provider.” The  Court may only compel disclosure of “only those matters directly relevant to  the nature of the specific ‘emotional or mental’ condition which the patient  has voluntarily disclosed and tendered in his pleadings or in answer to  discovery inquiries.” (In re Lifschutz (1970) 2 Cal. 3d 415, 431.) AFI  has also not demonstrated that its requests will result in production limited  strictly to what Plaintiff has specifically put at issue.  Lastly,  Plaintiff has offered AFI, during the meet and confer process, to limit the  records to all records pertaining to emotion distress from January 1, 2019 to  the present, where the reason for the visit was for “stress, anxiety,  depression,” which are the conditions that Plaintiff has alleged. Plaintiff  requests a “first peek” of the records to redact any other irrelevant portions  of the records and will provide a privilege log to AFI. While AFI contends in  its opposition that a “first peek agreement” is “highly inappropriate and  legally unsupported,” AFI fails to explain why. (Opposition, pages 7-8.) Thus,  the Court will grant Plaintiff’s request at a first peek arrangement. However,  because Plaintiff has disclosed that she suffers from the condition of  “insomnia” and from “panic attacks, Plaintiff has directly put these conditions  at issue in addition to “depression, stress, and anxiety.” (Ordway Decl. at ¶  4, Exhibit. 6, No. 212.2.) Also, Plaintiff responded to AFI’s interrogatory  that she began to suffer from anxiety and depression due to work-related stress  starting from 2018. (Id. at ¶ 4, Exhibit. 6, No. 204.2.)  Therefore, the Court will grant Plaintiff’s  alternative request but broaden the time frame from January 1, 2018 to present,  with the addition of the condition of insomnia and panic attacks.   Sanctions California Code  of Civil Procedure Section 1987.2(a) provides, as follows:¿  Except  as specified in subdivision (c), in making an order pursuant to motion made  under subdivision (c) of¿Section 1987¿or under¿Section 1987.1, the court  may in its discretion award the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred in  making or opposing the motion, including reasonable attorney’s fees, if the  court finds the motion was made or opposed in bad faith or without substantial  justification or that one or more of the requirements of the subpoena was  oppressive.              Because  of the mixed outcome of Plaintiff’s motion—the Court will not quash the  subpoena in its entirety and does not fully grant Plaintiff’s alternative  request—the Court declines to award sanctions to either party.                             The  Court therefore GRANTS in part Plaintiff’s motion to quash AFI’s deposition  subpoena seeking Plaintiff’s medical records from Kaiser. AFI’s deposition  subpoena is limited to: records pertaining to any emotional distress from  January 1, 2018 to present where the reason for visit was stress, anxiety,  depression, panic attacks, and insomnia, subject to a first peek agreement.              Plaintiff’s  request for monetary sanctions is DENIED.              AFI’s  request for monetary sanctions is DENIED.   /// /// It is so  ordered.   Dated:  October 30, 2024       _____________________ MEL RED RECANA Judge of the  Superior CourtSuperior Court of

Suruchlian (Plaintiff) filed this action against Defendants Answer Financial
Inc. (Defendant), Answer Financial, The Allstate Corporation, Allstate, Sharday
Bailey, and Does 1 to 100, inclusive, on July 14, 2021. Plaintiff alleges causes
of action for (1) Disability Discrimination under Government Code section
12940(a); (2) Disability Discrimination under Government Code section 12940(m);
(3) Disability Discrimination under Government Code section 12940(n); (4)
Retaliation under government Code section 12940(h); (5) Failure to Do
Everything Reasonably Necessary to Prevent Discrimination and Retaliation under
Government Code section 12940(k); (6) Violation of Government Code section
129545.2(a) of the California Family Rights Act; (7) Retaliation for Taking/Requesting
CFRA in Violation of Government Code section 12945.2(l); (8) Wrongful
Termination; and (9) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.The complaint
alleges the following: Plaintiff was employed by Defendant as an insurance
agent from December 8, 2014 until November 10, 2020. (Compl., ¶¶ 1, 22.) During
Plaintiff’s employment, she developed disabilities including an anxiety
disorder and panic attacks. (Id. at ¶ 25.) Plaintiff notified Defendants
and sought reasonable accommodations. (Id. at ¶ 26-27.)
On November 2, 2020 Plaintiff’s doctor placed her on modified activity from
November 3, 2020 to November 30, 2020 as a result of her disabilities. (Id.
at ¶ 28.) Subsequently, Plaintiff’s doctor placed her on medical leave from
November 10, 2022 until November 16, 2020 for her disabilities. (Id. at ¶
29.) Plaintiff provided Defendants with all doctor’s notes, but Defendants
refused to implement accommodations. (Id. at ¶ 30.) On November 10,
2020, Defendants terminated Plaintiff’s employment. (Id. at ¶ 31.) Since
being terminated, Plaintiff has not been re-hired, re-employed, or reinstated.
(C Id. at ¶ 33.)On August 30,
2021, Defendant filed a demurrer to Plaintiff’s Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress claim. The Court sustained the demurrer. (07/02/2024 -
Minute Order.On June 27 and
June 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motions to compel further responses
to Form Interrogatories - General (Set One) and Form Interrogatories –
Employment (Set One). Defendant filed oppositions on October 14, 2024.  Legal
StandardMotion to Compel
Further Responses to Form Interrogatories (FROGs)Where responses to interrogatories have
been served but the requesting party believes that they are deficient because
the answers are evasive or incomplete, or, because an objection is without
merit, that party may move for an order compelling a further response. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).) The motion must be made within 45 days after
service of verified responses in question, or any verified supplemental
responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (c).) The motion must be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration in compliance with Civil Procedure
section 2016.040. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (b).)Evidentiary
Objections (if applicable)None.DiscussionMotion
to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories – General (Set One)Merits of MotionPlaintiff moves to compel further
responses from Defendant to Form Interrogatories – General (Set One) Nos. 4.1,
4.2, and 12.1. Plaintiff moves on the grounds that: “(1) Defendant has refused
to provide complete responses to Plaintiff’s interrogatories, (2) the
objections made by Defendant as to Plaintiff’s interrogatories are without
merit or too general and (3) despite extensive meeting and conferring,
Defendant refuses to correct the discovery.” (Motion to Compel Further FROGs -
General, pg. 2:10-13.)a. FROG No. 4.1“At the time of the INCIDENT, was there in
effect any policy of insurance through which you were or might be insured in
any manner (for example, primary, pro-rata, or excess liability coverage or
medical expense coverage) for the damages, claims, or actions that have arisen
out of the INCIDENT? If so, for each policy state:(a) the kind of coverage; (b) the name and ADDRESS of the insurance
company; (c) the name, ADDRESS, and telephone
number of each named insured; (d) the policy number; (e) the limits of coverage for each type
of coverage contained in the policy; (f) whether any reservation of rights or
controversy or coverage dispute exists between you and the insurance company;
and(g) the name, ADDRESS, and telephone
number of the custodian of the policy.” (FROG No. 4.1)Defendant initially responded as follows:
“Defendant objects to this interrogatory on the grounds that it is vague,
confusing, ambiguous, irrelevant, and not reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence. Among other issues, Defendant further objects
to this interrogatory on the ground that the term "INCIDENT," as
defined by Plaintiff,[1] is
vague and ambiguous in the context of this litigation. Defendant further
objects to this request on the grounds that it seeks confidential and/or
proprietary business information.” (Response to FROG No. 4.1.)In response to Plaintiff’s issues with its
initial response, Defendant restated the same objections and added the
following supplemental response: “Subject to and without waiving the foregoing
objections, AFI responds as follows: No.” (Supplemental Response to FROG No.
4.1.) Where an interrogatory asks a “specific
and explicit [question], an answer which supplies only a portion of the
information sought is wholly insufficient.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 783.) “A party may not deliberately misconstrue a question for
the purpose of supplying an evasive answer. [Citation.] Indeed, where the
question is somewhat ambiguous, but the nature of the information sought is
apparent, the proper solution is to provide an appropriate response.” (Ibid.) Plaintiff’s definition of “incident” is
clear and asks Defendant to disclose whether Defendant had an insurance policy
that would cover damages and causes of action arising out of Plaintiff’s factual
allegations. Thus, the Court strikes Defendant’s objections. Accordingly, because Defendant provided a supplemental
response of “No” to FROG No. 4.1, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request to
compel further responses. b. FROG No. 4.2“Are you self-insured under any statute
for the damages, claims, or actions that have arisen out of the INCIDENT? If
so, specify the statute.” (FROG No. 4.2)Defendant initially responded as follows:
“Defendant objects to this interrogatory on the grounds that it is vague,
confusing, ambiguous, overly broad, unduly burdensome, irrelevant, and not
reasonably calculated to the lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Among other issues, Defendants further objects to this interrogatory on the
ground that the term “INCIDENT”, as defined by Plaintiff, is vague and
ambiguous in the context of the litigation. Defendant further objects to this
request on the grounds that it seeks confidential and/or proprietary business
information. Defendant further objects to this request on the grounds that it
is overly broad, unduly burdensome and oppressive.” (Response to FROG No. 4.2.)In response to Plaintiff’s issues with its
initial response, Defendant restated the same objections and added the
following supplemental response: “Subject to and without waiving the foregoing
objections, AFI responds as follows: No.” (Supplemental Response to FROG No.
4.2.) Where an interrogatory asks a “specific
and explicit [question], an answer which supplies only a portion of the
information sought is wholly insufficient.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84
Cal.App.3d 771, 783.) “A party may not deliberately misconstrue a question for
the purpose of supplying an evasive answer. [Citation.] Indeed, where the
question is somewhat ambiguous, but the nature of the information sought is
apparent, the proper solution is to provide an appropriate response.” (Ibid.) Defendant’s initial and supplemental
responses to FROG No. 4.2 suffer from the same issues as FROG No. 4.1. Thus, the
Court strikes Defendant’s objections. Accordingly, because Defendant provided a
supplemental response to FROG No. 4.2, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request to
compel further responses. c. FROG No. 12.1“State the name, ADDRESS, and telephone
number of each individual: (a) who witnessed the INCIDENT or the
events occurring immediately before or after the INCIDENT; (b) who made any statement at the scene of
the INCIDENT; (c) who heard any statements made about
the INCIDENT by any individual at the scene; and (d) who YOU OR ANYONE ACTING ON YOUR
BEHALF claim has knowledge of the INCIDENT (except for expert witnesses covered
by Code of Civil Procedure section 2034).” (FROG
No. 12.1)Defendant initially responded as follows:
“Defendant objects to this interrogatory on the grounds that it is vague,
confusing, ambiguous, overly broad, unduly burdensome, irrelevant, and not
reasonably calculated to the lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Among other issues, Defendants further objects to this interrogatory on the
ground that the term “INCIDENT”, as defined by Plaintiff, is vague and
ambiguous in the context of the litigation. Defendant further objects to this
interrogatory to the extent it seeks information that is protected from
disclosure by the attorney-client privilege and/or attorney work product
doctrine. Coito v. Superior Court (2012) 54 Ca1.4th 480, 486; Nacht
& Lewis Architects, Inc. v. Superior Court (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 214, 217.
Defendant further objects to this interrogatory on the grounds that it seeks
information that violates third parties’ constitutional rights to privacy.
Subject to and without waiving the foregoing objections, the following
individuals may have information relevant to this litigation: Plaintiff, who
may be contacted through Plaintiff’s counsel of record; Jennifer Sherry, Senior
Vice President, Agency Operations and Human Resources; Terri Alexander,
Director, Human Resources; both of whom may be contacted through Defendant’s
counsel of record. Defendant reserves the right to supplement its response to
this interrogatory with respect to any additional information discovered hereafter
pursuant to Defendant’s continuing investigation of the facts relating to this
case.” (Response to FROG No. 12.1.)In response to Plaintiff’s issues with its
initial response, Defendant restated the same objections and response.”
(Supplemental Response to FROG No. 12.1.) Attorney-client privilege“[W]itness statements are entitled as a
matter of law to at least qualified work product protection. The witness
statements may be entitled to absolute protection if defendant can show that
disclosure would reveal its ‘attorney’s impressions, conclusions, opinions, or
legal research or theories.’ If not, then the items may be subject to discovery
if plaintiff can show that ‘denial of discovery will unfairly prejudice [her]
in preparing [her] claim . . . or will result in an
injustice.’” (Coito v. Superior Court (2012) 54 Cal.4th 480, 486,
quoting Code Civ. Proc., § 2018.030, subds. (a), (b).) However, a list of
potential witnesses who gave counsel “their independently prepared statements
would have no tendency to reveal counsel’s evaluation of the case. Such a
list would therefore not constitute qualified work product.” (Nacht &
Lewis Architects, Inc. v. Superior Court 47 Cal.App.4th 214, 217-218.)Here, Defendant has already revealed the
names of employees with relevant information to Plaintiff’s claims. (Response
to FROG No. 12.1.) Plaintiff does not seek notes or anything referencing
Defendant’s counsel’s thoughts or strategy. Thus, information relating to the
potential witnesses’ telephone numbers and addresses is not protected by
attorney-client privilege or the work product doctrine.Right to privacy In analyzing person’s right to privacy in
the discovery context: (1) “a claimant must possess a ‘legally
protected privacy interest.’ (Citation)”; (2) “the claimant must have a
reasonable expectation of privacy under the particular circumstances, including
the customs, practices, and physical settings surrounding particular
activities. (Citation)”; and (3) “the invasion of privacy must be serious in
nature, scope, and actual or potential impact.” (Puerto v. Superior Court
(2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1250-1251.) “If there is a reasonable expectation
of privacy and the invasion of privacy is serious, then the court must balance
the privacy interest at stake against other competing or countervailing
interests, which include the interest of the requesting party, fairness to the
litigants in conducting the litigation, and the consequences of granting or
restricting access to the information. (Citation)” (Id. at p. 1251.)Expectation of Privacy
Former and current corporate employees
have a legitimate expectation privacy where they provide
their employers with their telephone numbers and addresses as a condition of
employment.  (Puerto v. Superior Court (2008) 158
Cal.App.4th 1242, 1252.) Here, the named individuals are
Defendant’s current employees, and thus have a reasonable expectation of
privacy.   Serious
InvasionWhere the
requested discovery is personal (i.e., contact information), rather than
sensitive (i.e., medical or financial details, political affiliations, sexual
relationships, or personnel information), sharing the information is not a
serious invasion of privacy; it is basic civil discovery. (Id. at pp.
1253-1254.) Information such as addresses and telephone numbers—the location of
witnesses—“is generally discoverable, and it is neither unduly personal nor
overly intrusive.” (Id. at p. 1254, citing Pioneer, at p. 373.) Any
such intrusion is less significant where the party withholding the information
has already disclosed the identity of the witnesses. (Puerto, supra,
158 Cal.App.4th at p. 1254.)Here, Plaintiff
seeks address and telephonic information of individuals Defendant already named
in order to contact them regarding what they witnessed at the scene of the
incident at issue. Plaintiff does not seek unrelated sensitive information. Because
Defendant has already disclosed the identity of individuals in responding to
FROG 12.1, disclosing the individuals’ address and telephone numbers is not a
serious invasion of privacy. Balancing of Interests“[W]hen the court concludes that there is
no serious invasion of privacy no balance of opposing interests is required.” (Puerto,
supra, 158 Cal.App.4th at p. 1256.) Accordingly,
because no issue of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, or
invasion of privacy exists, the Court grants Plaintiff’s request to compel
supplemental responses to FROG No. 12.1, including the individuals’ addresses
and telephone numbers.   Requests for Monetary Sanctions1.     
Awarding SanctionsAs
to monetary sanctions, Defendant contends that the Court should deny sanctions
because Defendant produced verified, supplemental responses to Plaintiff’s
motion before the hearing. (Opposition, p. 10:3-6.) Courts shall
impose monetary sanctions “against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a
demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., ¶ 2031.310, subd. (h).) “If a party
provides an untimely interrogatory response that does not
contain objections and that sets forth legally valid responses to
each interrogatory, the untimely response might completely or
substantially resolve the issues raised by a motion to
compel responses under section 2030.290.” (Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 408-409.) However, courts may award sanctions under the Discovery Act “in
favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though . . . the
requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.”
(See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1030(a); see also Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 409.) The
Court finds Defendant did not act with substantial justification or that
circumstances make imposing sanctions unjust. Plaintiff initially served this
discovery request on Defendant in November 2023. After Defendant served its
initial responses, Plaintiff gave Defendant numerous extensions to submit
supplemental responses. Over the course of five months, Plaintiff emailed with
Defendant, had telephone calls with Defendant, and clarified all Defendant’s
concerns. Defendant waited until the day before its most recent deadline
extension to request another extension to July 11, 2024. (Ordway Decl., ¶¶
10-11.) On June 26, 2024, Defendant informed Plaintiff that it would take some
time and effort to collect and review the documents and information sought, but
Plaintiff had given Defendant several extensions already for this same reason.
Frustrated with the constant back and forth, Plaintiff filed this motion to
compel supplemental responses on June 28, 2024. But for Defendant not sticking
to the parties’ agreed upon deadline extensions, Plaintiff would not have filed
this motion. Defendants did not serve supplemental responses until October 14,
2024. The Court notes that Plaintiff also requests monetary sanctions against
Defendant’s counsel of record for repeatedly failing to stick to extension
deadlines. The
Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to sanctions even though Defendant
served and filed supplemental responses prior to the hearing. Defendant’s
untimely responses contain objections and do not resolve all issues as the Court
has ordered Defendant to submit further responses. The Court therefore finds
monetary sanctions against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel of record are
proper because Plaintiff successfully made the motion.2.     
Plaintiff’s RequestPlaintiff
requests $1,350.00 in attorney’s fees and costs as monetary sanctions against Defendant
and Defendant’s counsel of record. Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate is $450. (Rodriguez
Decl., ¶ 45(a).) Plaintiff seeks to recover three hours: 1 hour for preparing
and filing this motion; 1 hour for attending the hearing; and anticipating 1
hour to review any opposition a prepare a reply brief. (Rodriguez Decl., ¶
45(a)-(c), (e).)The
Court finds Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate is reasonable, but the number of hours
Plaintiff seeks to recover is unreasonable. As of October 22, 2024, Plaintiff’s
counsel has not filed a reply brief. Additionally, the hearing on this matter
will likely last no more than 30 minutes. Accordingly, the Court finds it
reasonable to reduce the Plaintiff’s recoverable time as follows: 1 hour for
preparing and filing this motion; 0.5 hours for attending the hearing; and 0.5
hours for reviewing the opposition. Thus, Plaintiff’s total reduced recoverable
amount in attorney’s fees and costs is $900 ([1 hour + 0.5 hours + 0.5 hours) x
$450/hour).The
Court therefore GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against
Defendant and Defendant’s counsel of record in the reduced amount of $900 in
attorney’s fees. The Court orders Defendant Answer Financial Inc. and its
counsel of record, jointly and severally, to pay $900 to Plaintiff Eliza
Suruchlian, through her counsel of record, within 20 days of the date of this
ruling.

to from Defendants to Form Interrogatories - Employment Law, Set One (EROGs) 200.1,
200.3, 201.1, 201.3-201.4, 201.5-201.6, 204.3 and 204.6, 204.5, 204.7, 207.1,
207.2, 209.2, 211.1, 214.1 and 214.2, 215.1, 215.2.Plaintiff
establishes the following: On November 15, 2023, Plaintiff propounded on
Defendant EROGs (Set One). (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. 1.) After months of
extensions, Defendant served responses on January 10, 2024. (Rodriguez Decl., ¶
9, Exh. 2.) On February 5, 2024, Plaintiff sent Defendant a detailed meet and
confer letter outlining deficient responses and objections to Plaintiff’s
discovery. (Rodriguez Decl., ¶11, Exh. 3.) The letter explained to Defendant
that it failed to include full responses and responsive documents, laid out the
relevant statute and case law, and instructed Defendant on how to correct their
deficiencies. (Ibid.) Plaintiff requested Defendant provide further
responses by February 12, 2024. (Ibid.) On February 12, 2024, Defendant
responded to schedule a meet and confer call on February 21, 2024 and agreed to
extend Plaintiff’s deadline to file a Motion to Compel further to March 21,
2024. (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 13, Exh. 4.)On February 28,
2024, the parties met and conferred and reached an agreement regarding the
majority of Defendant’s responses and agreed to further evaluate their
responsive positions. (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 15, Exh. 5.) Plaintiff granted
Defendant’s request to provide supplemental responses by March 21, 2024, and
Defendant agreed to extend Plaintiff’s motion to compel deadline to April 4,
2024. (Ibid.) On March 19,
2024, Defendant responded to Plaintiff’s email and further agreed to supplement
more responses. (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 17, Exh. 6.) On March 21, 2024, Defendant
requested a two-week extension to supplement responses and granted an
additional two-week extension to Plaintiff’s motion to compel deadline to April
18, 2024. (Ibid.) On April 2,
2024, Defendant requested another extension to respond until April 16, 2024. (Rodriguez
Decl., ¶ 17, Exh. 7.) Plaintiff’s counsel responded that they would need
document production for review. (Ibid.) On April 3, 2024, the parties
had a second meet and confer call, wherein the remaining responses were
discussed and Defendant agreed to supplement. (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 21, Exh. 8.) On
April 5, 2024, Defendant provided its initial document production which
consisted of 111 pages. (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 23, Exh. 9.)  On April 16,
2024, Plaintiff’s counsel responded to Defendant’s counsel regarding what was
believed to be the remaining requests at issue. (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 25, Exh.
10.) Plaintiff’s again extended the respective deadlines to Defendant’s
supplemental responses and remaining documents to April 23, 2024 and
Plaintiff’s motion to compel deadline to May 9, 2024. (Ibid.)On May 1, 2024, Plaintiff’s
counsel emailed Defendant’s counsel again to confirm the agreement and
Defendant’s counsel agreed to extend Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel by two weeks
to May 16, 2024. (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 27, Exh. 11.)  On May 9, 2024,
the parties had a third meet and confer phone call wherein that parties
discussed the remaining issues, specifically Request for Production Nos. 11,
16, 17, 22, 36, 47 and 55. (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 29, Exh. 12.) Defendant would
not provide a date to provide supplemental responses. (Ibid.) On May 10, 2024,
Defendant counsel served its unverified supplemental responses to EROGs (Set
One), RFP (Set One), and FROGs (Set One). (Rodriguez
Decl., ¶ 42, Exh. 11.) However, the  supplemental responses remained deficient,
evasive, and incomplete. (Ibid.) Defendant’s counsel also failed to
provide any internal communications, such as emails, regarding Plaintiff’s
termination. (Ibid.) On May 16, 2024,
Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendant’s counsel again to confirm the agreement
and Defendant’s counsel agreed to extend Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel by two
weeks to after supplemental responses. (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 30, Exh. 12.) However,
this date was later changed. (Ibid.)On May 24, 2024,
Plaintiff’s counsel emailed Defendant’s counsel again to confirm the agreement
to supplement the remaining Production Request for Nos. 47. 33. (Rodriguez
Decl., ¶ 32, Exh. 13.)On May 30, 2024,
the parties had a fourth telephonic meet and confer to discuss Defendant’s
supplemental responses. (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 34, Exh. 14.) The parties agreed
that Defendant’s counsel would provide supplemental responses by June 13, 2024,
with Plaintiff’s motion to compel deadline extended to June 27, 2024. (Ibid.)
On June 3, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel sent an email to memorialize the May 30,
2024 conversation regarding Production Request No. 47, stating, “If this does
not match your understanding, please let me know.” (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 35, Exh.
14.) Defendant did
not provide supplemental responses, as agreed, by June 13, 2024. (Rodriguez
Decl., ¶ 37.) 38. On June 19, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel reached out to
Defendant’s counsel informing her that the supplemental responses were not
received. (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 38, Exh. 15.) Defendant did not respond. (Ibid.)On June 26,
2024, Defendant’s counsel emailed Plaintiff’s counsel to confirm the May 30,
2024 agreement and extended Defendant’s deadline to provide supplemental
responses to July 11, 2024. (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 40, Exh. 16.) Plaintiff’s
counsel denied this additional time as it was past the allegedly agreed due
date of June 3, 2024. (Ibid.) Throughout these
emails and telephonic meet and confers, Plaintiff attempted to clarify and
narrow its discovery requests.Defendant contends that Plaintiff’s motion
is unnecessary and not substantially justified because it served its
supplemental responses on October 14, 2024 before the hearing on the instant
motion. Defendant argues Plaintiff’s EROGs are overbroad, vague, and ambiguous
relative to the nine causes of action Plaintiff alleges and that they request
information which is protected under attorney-client privilege and the
work-product doctrine. Defendant also argues that Plaintiff’s motion ignores
good faith agreements the parties made during their meet and confer efforts. EROG Nos. 200.1 and 200.3EROG No. 200.1: “Do you contend that the
EMPLOYMENT relationship was “at will”? If so: (a) state all facts upon which you base
this contention; (b) state the name, ADDRESS, and telephone
number of each PERSON who has knowledge of those facts; and (c) identify all DOCUMENTS that support
your contention.”(EROG
No. 200.1.)EROG No. 200.3: “Do you contend that the
EMPLOYMENT relationship was governed by any agreement— written, oral, or
implied? If so: (a) state all facts upon which you base
this contention; (b) state the name, ADDRESS, and telephone
number of each PERSON who has knowledge of those facts; and (c) identify all DOCUMENTS that support
your contention.”(EROG
No. 200.3.)Defendant’s initial responses included the
following: “Yes, the employment relationship was “at-will.” (a) On November 20,
2014, Plaintiff signed an offer letter stating that her employment was “at
will.” On December 7, 2014, Plaintiff also signed an acknowledgement of the
Associate Handbook, which also indicated that her employment was at will. (b)
Plaintiff; Jennifer Sherry, Senior Vice President, Agency Operations and Human
Resources, who may be contacted through counsel for Defendant. (c) Defendant’s
policies and procedures; Plaintiffs acknowledgement of receipt and
understanding of Defendant’s policies and procedures; Plaintiffs offer letter.”
(Response to EROG Nos. 200.1, 200.3.)In clarifying her request for information
regarding whether Plaintiff was an “at-will” employee with Defendant,
Plaintiff’s counsel stated that for subsection (b) she would agree to Defendant
accepting “service and/or providing current employees last known contact if
they cease employment.” (Rodriguez Decl., Exh. 5, at p. 1, Exh. 6, at p. 2.)
For subsection (c), Plaintiff requested updated responses identifying specific
documents (“policies and procedures” and “Plaintiff’s acknowledgement of
receipt and understanding of Defendant’s policies and procedures”) supporting a
contention that Plaintiff was an “at will” employee. (Ibid.) Defendant provided supplemental responses
on October 14, 2024 naming specific documents (AFI’s policies and procedures;
Plaintiff’s acknowledgement of receipt and understanding of AFI’s policies and
procedures; Plaintiff’s offer letter) and listing the bates numbers AFI-00001-000111
and 000119-147 where Plaintiff can find these documents in Defendant’s
production. (Declaration of Alexandria M. Ordway [Ordway Decl.], Exh. 3, at p.
4.)However, Defendant failed to include
addresses and telephone numbers for the individuals named in its initial and
supplemental responses. As mentioned above, privacy issues are of no concern
here, especially because Defendants already disclosed the names of the
individuals, and Plaintiff’s counsel never agreed to Defendant’s request for a
protective order controlling what Plaintiff requests from the named
individuals.Accordingly, the
Court grants Plaintiff’s request to compel supplemental responses to EROG Nos.
200.1 and 200.3, including the individuals’ addresses and telephone numbers.  EROGs No. 201.1 EROG No.: “Was
the EMPLOYEE involved in a TERMINATION? If so:(a) state all
reasons for the EMPLOYEE’S TERMINATION; (b) state the
name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of each PERSON who participated in the
TERMINATION decision; (c) state the
name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of each PERSON who provided any information
relied upon in the TERMINATION decision; and (d) identify all
DOCUMENTS relied upon in the TERMINATION decision.”(EROG No. 201.1.) Plaintiff
requested supplemental responses with witness contact information and
references to specific bates numbers identifying documents relied upon for
Plaintiff’s termination. (Rodriguez
Decl., Exhs. 3, 5.) For subsection (b), Defendant provided supplemental
responses on October 14, 2024 identifying specific employees and their
positions, but without their contact information, and stating both employees
can be contacted through Defendant’s Counsel. (Ordway Decl., Exh. 3, at p. 6.)
For subsection (d), Defendant’s supplemental response refers Plaintiff to
specific bates numbers in it document production and a November 6, 2020 email
between Plaintiff Terri Alexander Ramsay, Jennifer Sherry and Roxy Balian. (Ibid.)Thus, while Defendant’s supplemental response
to subsection (d) was sufficient, Defendant’s supplemental response to subsection
(b) was not. As mentioned above, Defendant must provide Plaintiff with the
addresses and telephone addresses of the named individuals. Accordingly, the
Court grants Plaintiff’s request to compel supplemental responses to EROG No.
201.1, including the individuals’ addresses and telephone numbers. EROGs Nos. 201.3 and 201.4 EROG No. 201.3:
“Were there any other ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTIONS, including (the asking
party should list the ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTIONS): Reduction in hours,
demotion, suspension, disciplinary write ups, performance improvement plans,
verbal discipline If so, for each
action, provide the following: (a) all reasons
for each ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION; (b) the name,
ADDRESS, and telephone number of each PERSON who participated in making each
ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION decision; (c) the name,
ADDRESS, and telephone number of each PERSON who provided any information
relied upon in making each ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION decision; and (d) the identity
of all DOCUMENTS relied upon in making each ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION decision.”(EROG No. 201.3.)EROG No. 201.4:
“Was the TERMINATION or any other ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTIONS referred to in
Interrogatories 201.1 through 201.3 based in whole or in part on the EMPLOYEE’S
job performance? If so, for each action: (a) identify the
ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION; (b) identify the
EMPLOYEE’S specific job performance that played a role in that ADVERSE
EMPLOYMENT ACTION; (c) identify any
rules, guidelines, policies, or procedures that were used to evaluate the
EMPLOYEE’S specific job performance; (d) state the
names, ADDRESSES, and telephone numbers of all PERSONS who had responsibility
for evaluating the specific job performance of the EMPLOYEE; (e) state the
names, ADDRESSES, and telephone numbers of all PERSONS who have knowledge of
the EMPLOYEE’S specific job performance that played a role in that ADVERSE
EMPLOYMENT ACTION; and (f) describe all
warnings given with respect to the EMPLOYEE’S specific job performance.”(EROG No. 201.4.)Plaintiff challenges
Defendant’s responses on the grounds that they are evasive, unresponsive, and
incomplete. Defendant’s initial response was that the interrogatory was vague
(specifically the definition of “ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION, confusing,
ambiguous, overly broad, unduly burdensome, irrelevant, and not reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Response to EROG
nos. 201.3, 201.4.) Defendant’s
supplemental responses repeat the same objections and argues the interrogatory
seeks information protected by attorney-client privilege and the attorney work
product doctrine and seeks information violating third parties’ constitutional
rights.  Defendant refers Plaintiff to
bates numbers in its production containing her counseling statements. (Ordway Decl., Exh.
3, at p. 7.) Additionally, Defendant provides specific dates and descriptions
of Plaintiff’s counseling sessions and provides the names of the employees
involved in those sessions. (Supplemental Response to EROG Nos. 201.3, 201.4.)
Defendant also provides the names of specific employees who were involved in
adverse employment actions. (Ordway Decl., Exh. 3, at pgs. 7:7-28, 8-9, 10:1-19,
12:9-18; 13-18, 19:1-4.)However, Defendant fails to provide the
addresses and telephone numbers of the requested individuals. As mentioned
above, no privacy or attorney-client privilege issues exist here. Plaintiff
seeks this information in order to determine which individuals were involved in
Plaintiff’s termination and to learn the steps taken leading up to Plaintiff’s
termination. This information is relevant to Plaintiff’s claims, and Plaintiff
cannot access the information any other way. Accordingly, the
Court grants Plaintiff’s request to compel supplemental responses to EROG Nos.
201.3 and 201.4, including the individuals’ addresses and telephone numbers. EROGs Nos. 201.5 and 201.6EROG No. 201.5: “Was any PERSON hired to replace the EMPLOYEE after the
EMPLOYEE’S TERMINATION or demotion? If so, state the PERSON’S name, job title,
qualifications, ADDRESS and telephone number, and the date the PERSON was
hired.”(EROG No.
201.5.)EROG No. 201.6: “Has any PERSON performed any of the EMPLOYEE’S former
job duties after the EMPLOYEE’S TERMINATION or demotion? If so: (a) state the PERSON’S name, job title, ADDRESS, and telephone number; (b) identify the duties; and (c) state the date on which the PERSON started to perform the duties.”(EROG No.
201.6.)Plaintiff requested the Defendants provide full non-evasive responses.Defendant’s initial response to 201.5 objected on vagueness grounds,
overbreadth grounds, and constitutional rights to privacy grounds, and stated
Plaintiff’s job duties were not transferred to anyone else and then went into a
description of the Defendant’s company does. Defendant’s initial response to
201.6 objected and responded on the same grounds.Defendant’s supplemental response to 201.5 objected on the same grounds
but explicitly stated “No, Plaintiff was not specifically replaced, and her job
duties were not transferred to any specific employee” and included the same
description of Defendant’s company. (Ordway Decl., Exh. 3, at p. 19.)
Defendant’s supplemental response to 201.6 objected on the same grounds as the
original response and provided the same response. Here, Defendant’s
supplemental response to EROG No. 201.6 is completely unresponsive to
Plaintiff’s question of whether any person performed any of Plaintiff’s former
jobs duties after Plaintiff’s termination. Where an interrogatory asks a
“specific and explicit [question], an answer which supplies only a portion of
the information sought is wholly insufficient.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne
(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 783.) “A party may not deliberately misconstrue a
question for the purpose of supplying an evasive answer.” (Ibid.) Accordingly, because Defendant provided a
proper supplemental response to EROG No. 201.5, the Court denies Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses. The Court grants Plaintiff’s request to
compel further responses to EROG No. 201.6.EROGs Nos. 204.3, 204.5, 204.6, and 204.7Plaintiff requested responses regarding Defendant’s communications about
Plaintiff’s disability and need for accommodations, regardless of whether those
communications were between Plaintiff and Defendant or Plaintiff’s healthcare
provider and Defendant. Defendant’s initial responses objected on vagueness grounds, overbreadth
grounds, and constitutional rights to privacy grounds, and stated Plaintiff’s
job duties were not transferred to anyone else and then explained that the
request was unduly burdensome and expensive because it required Defendant to
prepare of summary of its business records in order to produce any relevant
communications. (Ordway
Decl., Exh. 3, at p. 58-59.)Defendant’s supplemental responses object
on the same grounds, states Plaintiff did not have written communications with
Defendant about having a disability or needing accommodations and that
Plaintiff provided Defendant with notes from Plaintiff’s healthcare provider.
(Ordway Decl., Exh. 3, at p. 21.) Defendant also referred Plaintiff to specific
bates numbers in Defendant’s production. (Ibid.) Defendant also stated
that Plaintiff never submitted the requested ADA form detailing and certifying
any specific work restrictions or requested accommodation to Defendant. (Ibid.)
Defendant also provided a description and timeline of Plaintiff’s requests for
approved modified work schedules beginning in February 2020, as well as the
reason for these requests, including Plaintiff needing to be with her daughter.
(Ordway Decl., Exh. 3, at p. 21-25.)However, Defendant did not provide the
names, addresses, or telephone numbers of individuals who witnessed the
communications requested.Accordingly, because Defendant provided a
proper supplemental response to EROG No. 204.5, the Court denies Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses for this EROG. The Court grants Plaintiff’s request to
compel further responses to EROG Nos. 204.3,
204.6, and 204.7. EROGs Nos. 207.1 and 207.2EROG No. 207.1: “Were there any internal written policies or regulations
of the EMPLOYER that apply to the making of a complaint of the type that is the
subject matter of this lawsuit? If so:(a) state the title and date of each DOCUMENT containing the policies or
regulations and a general description of the DOCUMENT’S contents; (b) state the manner in which the DOCUMENT was communicated to EMPLOYEES;
(c) state the manner, if any, in which EMPLOYEES acknowledged receipt of
the DOCUMENT or knowledge of its contents, or both; (d) state, if you contend that the EMPLOYEE failed to use any available
internal complaint procedures, all facts that support that contention; and (e) state, if you contend that the EMPLOYEE’S failure to use internal
complaint procedures was excused, all facts why the EMPLOYEE’S use of the
procedures was excused.”(EROG No.
207.1.)EROG No. 207.2: “Did the EMPLOYEE complain to the EMPLOYER about any of
the unlawful conduct alleged in the PLEADINGS? If so, for each complaint: (a) state the date of the complaint; (b) state the nature of the complaint; (c) state the name and ADDRESS of each PERSON to whom the complaint was
made; (d) state the name, ADDRESS, telephone number, and job title of each
PERSON who investigated the complaint; (e) state the name, ADDRESS, telephone number, and job title of each
PERSON who participated in making decisions about how to conduct the
investigation; (f) state the name, ADDRESS, telephone number, and job title of each
PERSON who was interviewed or who provided an oral or written statement as part
of the investigation of the complaint; (g) state the nature and date of any action taken in response to the
complaint; (h) state whether the EMPLOYEE who made the complaint was made aware of
the actions taken by the EMPLOYER in response to the complaint, and, if so,
state how and when; (i) identify all DOCUMENTS relating to the complaint, the investigation,
and any action taken in response to the complaint; and (j) state the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of each PERSON who has
knowledge of the EMPLOYEE’S complaint or the EMPLOYER’S response to the
complaint.”(EROG No.
207.2.)Plaintiff requested responses stating the title and date of Defendant’s
internal written policies or regulations that would apply to the types of
complaints Plaintiff alleges in this lawsuit. Defendant’s initial responses
referred to a mass of documents including its Associate Handbook without
provide bates numbers for Plaintiff’s reference and objected on grounds that
the interrogatories are vague, confusing, ambiguous, overly broad, unduly
burdensome, irrelevant, and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery
of admissible evidence. Defendant also complained it did not understand the
meaning of “complaint” and “unlawful conduct” in the context of the
interrogatories.Plaintiff clarified the meanings, and Defendant’s supplemental responses
included the same objections and provided specific document names and bates
numbers for EROGs No. 207.1. However, Defendant’s supplemental response to EROG
No. 207.2 again objected on the same grounds and answered “No.” (Ordway Decl.,
Exh. 3, at p. 36-37:1-5.) Thus, Defendant’s supplemental responses were
sufficient.Accordingly, because Defendant provided
proper supplemental responses, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request to compel
further responses to EROG Nos. 207.1 and 207.2. EROGs Nos. 209.2EROG No. 209.2: “Except for this action, in the past 10 years has any
employee filed a civil action against the EMPLOYER regarding his or her
employment? If so, for each civil action: (a) state the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of each employee who
filed the action; (b) state the court, names of the parties, and case number of the civil
action; (c) state the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of any attorney
representing the EMPLOYER; and (d) state whether the action has been resolved or is pending.”(EROG No.
209.2.) Defendant’s initial response objected on grounds of vagueness,
overbreadth, unduly burdensome expenses, attorney-client privilege,
constitutional rights to privacy, and that Plaintiff could find the information
itself. After meeting and conferring, the parties agreed to limit the request to
the last five years on all claims except the Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress Claim, which has since been dismissed. Defendant’s
supplemental response presented the same objections as above, but also listed
one case, naming a former employee, Defendant’s counsel in the case, and the
status of the case.Accordingly, because Defendant provided a
supplemental response based on the parties’ agreement, the Court denies
Plaintiff’s request to compel further responses to EROG No. 209.2.  EROGs No. 211.1EROG No. 211.1: “Identify each type of BENEFIT to which the EMPLOYEE
would have been entitled, from the date of the ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION to the
present, if the ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION had not happened and the EMPLOYEE had
remained in the same job position. For each type of benefit, state the amount
the EMPLOYER would have paid to provide the benefit for the EMPLOYEE during
this time period and the value of the BENEFIT to the EMPLOYEE.”(EROG No.
211.1.)Defendant’s initial response objected on grounds that the interrogatory
is vague, confusing, ambiguous, overly broad, irrelevant, and seeks information
that is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence and is protected by attorney-client privilege and attorney work
product doctrine. Defendant also objected on the ground that the term “ADVERSE
EMPLOYMENT ACTION” and “BENEFIT” as defined by Plaintiff, is vague, ambiguous,
and overly broad in the context of this litigation.Defendant’s supplemental response objected on the same grounds as above,
but also provided a list of both the benefits available to Plaintiff and the
benefits Plaintiff received at the time she was terminated. (Ordway Decl.,
Exh. 3, at pgs. 39:25-28, 40:1-14.) Defendant also provided a bates number
referencing Plaintiff’s paystubs from 2014-2020.Accordingly, because Defendant provided a
proper supplemental response based on the parties’ agreement, the Court denies
Plaintiff’s request to compel further responses to EROG No. 211.1.  EROGs Nos. 214.1 and 214.2EROG No. 214.1: “At the time of the ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION, was there
in effect any policy of insurance through which you were or might be insured in
any manner for the damages, claims, or actions that have arisen out of the
ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION? If so, for each policy state:(a) the kind of coverage; (b) the name and ADDRESS of the insurance company; (c) the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of each named insured; (d) the policy number; (e) the limits of coverage for each type of coverage contained in the
policy; (f) whether any reservation of rights or controversy or coverage dispute
exists between you and the insurance company; and (g) the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the custodian of the
policy”(EROG No.
214.1.)EROG No. 214.2: “Are you self-insured under any statute for the damages,
claims, or actions that have arisen out of the ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION? If
so, specify the statute.”(EROG No.
214.2.)Defendant’s initial response objected on the grounds that it is vague,
confusing, ambiguous, overly broad, irrelevant, and seeks information that is
not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and
that it seeks confidential, proprietary and/or trade secret information or
seeks information that violates third parties’ constitutional rights to privacy.
Defendant also objected on the ground that the term “ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION”
as defined by Plaintiff, is vague, ambiguous, and overly broad in the context
of this litigation. Defendant’s supplemental responses objected on the same
grounds but included the answer “No.” (Ordway Decl., p. 41:3-11, 41:16-24.)
Plaintiff’s request is clear and straightforward, and the Court strikes
Defendant’s objections.Accordingly, because Defendant provided a
proper supplemental response, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request to compel
further responses to EROG Nos. 214.1 and 214.2. EROGs Nos. 215.1 and 215.2EROG No. 215.1: “Have YOU OR ANYONE ACTING ON YOUR BEHALF interviewed any
individual concerning the ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION? If so, for each individual
state: (a) the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the individual
interviewed;(b) the date of the interview; and (c) the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the PERSON who conducted
the interview.”EROG No. 215.2: “Have YOU OR ANYONE ACTING ON YOUR BEHALF obtained a
written or recorded statement from any individual concerning the ADVERSE
EMPLOYMENT ACTION? If so, for each statement state: (a) the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the individual from whom
the statement was obtained; (b) the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of the individual who
obtained the statement; (c) the date the statement was obtained; and (d) the name, ADDRESS, and telephone number of each PERSON who has the
original statement or a copy.”(EROG No.
215.2.)Defendant’s initial responses objected on the grounds that the
interrogatory is vague, confusing, ambiguous, overly broad, unduly burdensome,
irrelevant, and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. Defendant also objected to the interrogatory because it
seeks information that is protected from discovery by the attorney-client
privilege and/or the attorney work product doctrine. After the parties agreed that the interrogatory does not seek information
regarding statements following the commencement of this litigation obtained by
or at the direction of counsel, Defendant’s supplemental responses objected on
the same grounds and provided an answer of “No.” The Court strikes Defendant’s
objections.Accordingly, because Defendant provided a
proper supplemental responses based on the parties’ agreement, the Court denies
Plaintiff’s request to compel further responses to EROG Nos. 215.1 and 215.2.   Requests for Monetary Sanctions3.     
Awarding SanctionsAs
to monetary sanctions, Defendant contends that the Court should deny sanctions
because Defendant produced supplemental responses to Plaintiff’s motion before
the hearing. (Opposition, p. 19:8-11.) Courts shall
impose monetary sanctions “against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a
demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., ¶ 2031.310, subd. (h).) “If a party
provides an untimely interrogatory response that does not
contain objections and that sets forth legally valid responses to
each interrogatory, the untimely response might completely or
substantially resolve the issues raised by a motion to
compel responses under section 2030.290.” (Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at pp. 408-409.) However,
courts may award sanctions under the Discovery Act “in favor of a party who
files a motion to compel discovery, even though . . . the
requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.”
(See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1030(a); see also Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc., supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p, 409.) The
Court finds Defendant did not act with substantial justification or that
circumstances make imposing sanctions unjust. Plaintiff initially served this
discovery request on Defendant in November 2023. After Defendant served its
initial responses, Plaintiff gave Defendant numerous extensions to submit
supplemental responses. (Rodriguez Decl., ¶¶ 9-40.) Over the course of five
months, Plaintiff emailed with Defendant, had telephone calls with Defendant,
and clarified all Defendant’s concerns. Defendant waited until the day before
its most recent deadline extension to request another extension to July 11,
2024. (Ordway Decl., ¶¶ 10-11.) Defendant served deficient supplemental
responses on May 10, 2024, but Defendant’s responses were still incomplete and
evasive. (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 42, Exh. 11.) On June 26, 2024, Defendant informed
Plaintiff that it would take some time and effort to collect and review the
documents and information sought, but Plaintiff had given Defendant several
extensions already for this same reason. Frustrated with the constant back and
forth, Plaintiff filed this motion to compel supplemental responses on June 28,
2024. But for Defendant not sticking to the parties’ agreed upon deadline
extensions, Plaintiff would not have filed this motion. Defendants did not
serve supplemental responses until October 14, 2024. The Court notes that
Plaintiff also requests monetary sanctions against Defendant’s counsel of
record for repeatedly failing to stick to extension deadlines. The
Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to sanctions even though Defendant
served and filed supplemental responses prior to the hearing. Defendant’s
untimely responses contain objections and do not resolve all issues as the Court
has ordered Defendant to submit further responses. The Court therefore finds
monetary sanctions against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel of record are
proper because Plaintiff successfully made the motion.4.     
Plaintiff’s RequestPlaintiff
requests $2,700.00 in attorney’s fees and costs as monetary sanctions against Defendant
and Defendant’s counsel of record. Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate is $450.
(Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 45(a).) Plaintiff seeks to recover for six hours: 3 hours
for preparing and filing this motion; 1 hour for attending the hearing; and
anticipating 2 hours to review any opposition a prepare a reply brief.
(Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 45(a)-(c), (e).)The
Court finds Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate is reasonable, but the number of
hours Plaintiff seeks to recover is unreasonable. As of October 22, 2024,
Plaintiff’s counsel has not filed a reply brief. The hearing will cover all
Plaintiff’s requests to compel further responses for which the Court has
already awarded sanctions. Accordingly, the Court finds it reasonable to reduce
the Plaintiff’s recoverable time as follows: 3 hours for preparing and filing
this motion; 0 hours for attending the hearing; and 1 hour for reviewing the
opposition. Thus, Plaintiff’s total reduced recoverable amount in attorney’s
fees and costs is $1,800 ([3 hours + 1 hours) x $450/hour).The
Court therefore GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against
Defendant and Defendant’s counsel of record in the reduced amount of
$1,800  in attorney’s fees. The Court
orders Defendant Answer Financial Inc. and its counsel of record, jointly and
severally, to pay $1,800  to Plaintiff
Eliza Suruchlian, through her counsel of record, within 20 days of the date of
this ruling.             It
is so ordered. Dated: October 30, 2024 _______________________MEL RED RECANAJudge of the

Suruchlian (Plaintiff) filed this action against Defendants Answer Financial
Inc. (Defendant), Answer Financial, The Allstate Corporation, Allstate, Sharday
Bailey, and Does 1 to 100, inclusive, on July 14, 2021. Plaintiff alleges
causes of action for (1) Disability Discrimination under Government Code
section 12940(a); (2) Disability Discrimination under Government Code section
12940(m); (3) Disability Discrimination under Government Code section 12940(n);
(4) Retaliation under government Code section 12940(h); (5) Failure to Do
Everything Reasonably Necessary to Prevent Discrimination and Retaliation under
Government Code section 12940(k); (6) Violation of Government Code section
129545.2(a) of the California Family Rights Act; (7) Retaliation for
Taking/Requesting CFRA in Violation of Government Code section 12945.2(l); (8)
Wrongful Termination; and (9) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.The complaint
alleges the following: Plaintiff was employed by Defendant as an insurance
agent from December 8, 2014 until November 10, 2020. (Compl., ¶¶ 1, 22.) During
Plaintiff’s employment, she developed disabilities including anxiety disorder,
and panic attacks. (Id. at ¶ 25.) Plaintiff notified all Defendants and
sought reasonable accommodations. (Id. at ¶
26-27.) On November 2, 2020 Plaintiff’s doctor placed her on modified activity
from November 3, 2020 to November 30, 2020 as a result of her disabilities. (Id.
at ¶ 28.) Subsequently, Plaintiff’s doctor placed her on medical leave from
November 10, 2022 until November 16, 2020 for her disabilities. (Id. at
¶ 29.) Plaintiff provided Defendants with all doctor’s notes, but Defendants
refused to implement accommodations. (Id. at ¶ 30.) On November 10,
2020, Defendants terminated Plaintiff’s employment. (Id. at ¶ 31.) Since
being terminated, Plaintiff has not been re-hired, re-employed, or reinstated.
(C Id. at ¶ 33.)On August 30,
2021, Defendant filed a demurrer to Plaintiff’s Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress claim. The Court sustained the demurrer. (07/02/2024 -
Minute Order.On June 27 and
June 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to compel further responses
to Request for Production of Documents (Set One). Defendant filed an opposition
on October 14, 2024. Defendant
produced its second document production (bates numbers AFI-000112-000965) on
August 6, 2024. (Ordway Decl., ¶ 21.) Defendant produced its third document
production (bates numbers AFI-000966-001293) on August 23, 2024. (Ordway Decl.,
¶ 22.) Defendant produced its fourth document production on October 14, 2024.
Defendant did not provide bates numbers for this production. (Ordway Decl., ¶ 26.) Legal
StandardMotion
to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production of DocumentsWhere responses to requests for production
of documents have been served but the requesting party believes that they are
deficient because the statement of compliance is incomplete, the representation
of an inability to comply is inadequate, evasive, or incomplete, or, because an
objection is without merit, that party may move for an order compelling a
further response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).) The motion must be
made within 45 days after service of verified responses in question, or any verified
supplemental responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).) The motion
must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration in compliance with Civil
Procedure section 2016.040. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b).)  Attorney-Client Privilege and the Work
Product Doctrine“[W]itness statements are entitled as a
matter of law to at least qualified work product protection. The witness
statements may be entitled to absolute protection if defendant can show that
disclosure would reveal its ‘attorney’s impressions, conclusions, opinions, or
legal research or theories.’ If not, then the items may be subject to discovery
if plaintiff can show that ‘denial of discovery will unfairly prejudice [her]
in preparing [her] claim . . . or will result in an
injustice.’” (Coito v. Superior Court (2012) 54 Cal.4th 480, 486,
quoting Code Civ. Proc., § 2018.030, subds. (a), (b).) However, a list of
potential witnesses who gave counsel “their independently prepared statements
would have no tendency to reveal counsel’s evaluation of the case. Such a
list would therefore not constitute qualified work product.” (Nacht &
Lewis Architects, Inc. v. Superior Court 47 Cal.App.4th 214, 217-218.)When a party withholds information
responsive to an inspection demand, the party must provide the court with a
privilege log. (Hernandez v. Superior Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 285,
291-202.) The privilege log should “provide the identity and capacity of all
individuals who authored, sent, or received each allegedly privileged document,
the document's date, a brief description of the document and its contents or
subject matter sufficient to determine whether the privilege applies, and the
precise privilege or protection asserted.” (Catalina Island Yacht Club v.
Superior Court (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1130.)  Evidentiary
Objections (if applicable)None.  DiscussionMotion
to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production (RFP) of Documents (Set
One) Nos. 1-2, 4-12, 16-22, 24-27, 31-41, 43-58, 60Merits of MotionPlaintiff moves to compel Defendant to
produce all documents relating to Plaintiff’s employment, communications from
termination decision makers regarding Plaintiff’s termination, and any other
communications from individuals involved in Plaintiff’s termination and the
alleged illegal practices. (Declaration of Melanie Rodriguez [Rodriguez Decl.],
¶ 14.) As of the date Plaintiff filed this motion, Defendant’s responses
limited document production to those documents Defendant deems relevant or
responsive. (Rodriguez Decl., Exh. 3.)Defendant
alleges that it has good cause for the delay in producing all the requested
documents because of the length of Plaintiff’s employment, the number of
requests for production, the amount of time it took to collect relevant
information from third parties, and because it took a significant time to
collect, review, and produce the documents demanded. (Declaration of Alexandria
M. Ordway [Ordway Decl.], ¶ 27.)  RFP No. 1RFP No. 1: “Any files or DOCUMENTS
PERTAINING to PLAINTIFF’s performance evaluations or discipline during
PLAINTIFF’s employment with DEFENDANT.”Defendant’s initial response objected on vagueness,
ambiguity, and overbreadth grounds regarding the terms “pertaining” and
“defendant.” Defendant also objected due to attorney-client privilege and work
product doctrine grounds. Defendant further objected to the request on the
grounds that Plaintiff sought documents containing confidential, proprietary
and/or trade secret information or information the disclosure of which would
violate third parties’ constitutional rights to privacy. (Responses to RFP No.
1.)Defendant’s supplemental response objected
on the same grounds, but also provided the following response: “Subject
to . . . the parties’ agreement that “PERTAINING TO” mean
“refer to” or “constitute,” AFI responds as follows: AFI will produce all
non-privileged responsive documents that AFI is able to locate in its
possession, custody and/or control after a reasonable search and diligent
inquiry.” (Supplemental Responses to RFP No.1.)The Court disagrees with Defendant’s
objections. The request explicitly seeks all documents relating to Plaintiff’s performance
evaluation and discipline, if any, during Plaintiff’s employment with
Defendant. Defendant cannot hide behind attorney-client privilege or the work
product doctrine to avoid providing the requested RFP. Thus, the Court strikes
Defendant’s objections. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 1 and orders Defendant to
provide a Privilege Log listing all privileged documents which are responsive
to RFP No. 1. RFP No. 2RFP No. 2: “Every written job description
for any position held by PLAINTIFF during PLAINTIFF’s employment with
DEFENDANT”Defendant’s initial response objected on
the grounds that it is vague, confusing, ambiguous, overly broad, unduly
burdensome, irrelevant, not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence, overbroad regarding the term “Defendant,” and the
documents sought contain confidential and trade secret information. Defendant
also responded as follows: “Defendant will produce the job description for an
AFI insurance sales agent, Plaintiffs only position during her employment with
Defendant following her hire as a sales agent trainee, that Defendant is able
to locate in its possession, custody and/or control after a reasonable search
and diligent inquiry.” (Responses to RFP No. 2.)Defendant’s supplemental response included
the same objections in addition to the following: “AFI will produce all
non-privileged responsive documents that AFI is able to locate in its
possession, custody and/or control after a reasonable search and diligent
inquiry.” (Supplemental Responses to RFP No. 2.) Defendant does not state
whether it has “privileged responsive documents” in its possession that relate
to this request. The answering party must produce direct
and straightforward answers in good faith and produce all documents in the requested
category. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.200; Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.
App. 3d 771, 783; Hernandez v. Superior Court, (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th
285, 293-294.) The Court disagrees with Defendant’s
objections and finds Defendant’s responses evasive. The request explicitly
seeks a job description for each role Plaintiff had when employed by Defendant.
Defendant cannot hide behind attorney-client privilege or the work product
doctrine to avoid providing the requested RFP. Thus, the Court strikes
Defendant’s objections.Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 2 and orders Defendant to
provide a Privilege Log listing all privileged documents which are responsive
to RFP No. 2.   RFPs No. 4RFP No. 4: “Any DOCUMENTS setting forth
DEFENDANT’s rules and policies for its employees at any time during PLAINTIFF’s
employment at DEFENDANT.”Defendant’s initial response objected on
vagueness, overbreadth, and unduly burdensome grounds. Defendant also claimed
Plaintiff’s request included confidential trade secret information. Defendant’s
response limited Plaintiff’s request to the following: “Defendant will produce
its anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation policies, and medical leaves of
absence policies, including its procedures for reporting discrimination and/or
retaliation, that were operative during Plaintiffs employment with Defendant that
Defendant is able to locate in its possession, custody and/or control after a
reasonable search and diligent inquiry.” (Responses to RFP No. 4.)After the parties agreed to limit the
request to policies regarding medical leave including FMLA leave, medical
absences, discipline including progressive discipline, attendance, performance
evaluations, anti-retaliation / discrimination, and complaint procedures, Defendant’s
supplemental response mirrored the same objections as its initial response, but
included the following: “AFI will produce all non-privileged responsive
documents that it is able to locate in its possession, custody, and/or control
after a reasonable search and diligent inquiry.” (Supplemental Responses to RFP
No. 4.)The Court disagrees with Defendant’s
objections. The request is very clear in that it seeks all documents relating
to Plaintiff’s wages, compensation, and explicitly stated benefits Plaintiff
may have received during her employment with Defendant. Thus, the Court strikes
Defendant’s objections. However, Defendant has provided a sufficient
supplemental response.Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 4.RFP No.5RFP No. 5: “All DOCUMENTS RELATING to
DEFENDANT’s hiring of PLAINTIFF.”Defendant’s initial response objected on
vagueness, overbreadth, and unduly burdensome grounds. Defendant’s initial
responses also claimed Plaintiff’s request included confidential trade secret
information. (Responses to RFP No. 5.) Defendant also stated it would produce “Plaintiff’s
offer letter and onboarding documents that it is able to locate in its
possession, custody, and/or control after a reasonable search and diligent
inquiry.” (Responses to RFP No. 5.)Defendant’s supplemental response mirrored
the same objections as its initial response but included the following: AFI
will produce all non-privileged responsive documents that it is able to locate
in its possession, custody, and/or control after a reasonable search and
diligent inquiry.” (Supplemental Responses to RFP Nos. 5.)The Court disagrees with Defendant’s objections
and strikes each one.Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 5 and orders Defendant to
provide a Privilege Log listing all privileged documents which are responsive
to RFP No. 5. RFP No. 6RFP No. 6: “All DOCUMENTS constituting
COMMUNICATIONS between PLAINTIFF and DEFENDANT.”Defendant’s initial response objected on
the following grounds: “vague, confusing, ambiguous, overly broad, unduly
burdensome, irrelevant, and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery
of admissible evidence.” (Responses to RFP No. 6.) Defendant also stated it
would produce “Plaintiff’s offer letter and onboarding documents that it is
able to locate in its possession, custody, and/or control after a reasonable
search and diligent inquiry.” (Responses to RFP No. 6.)After the parties agreed to limit the
request to “All DOCUMENTS constituting COMMUNICATIONS between PLAINTIFF and
PLAINTIFF’s manager(s) and/or Human Resources personnel constituting
evaluations of PLAINTIFF’s job performance, or discussing Plaintiff’s alleged
disability, request for medical leave, or accommodation requests, and time off
requests,” Defendant’s supplemental response mirrored the same objections as
its initial response, but included the following: “AFI responds as follows: AFI
will produce all non-privileged responsive documents that it is able to locate
in its possession, custody, and/or control after a reasonable search and
diligent inquiry.” (Supplemental Responses to RFP No. 6.)The Court strikes Defendant’s objections.Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 6 and orders Defendant to
provide a Privilege Log listing all privileged documents which are responsive
to RFP No. 6. RFPs Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12RFP No. 7: “All DOCUMENTS used by
DEFENDANT within the past five (5) years in training of its officers,
shareholders, supervisors, managers, associate managers, associate supervisors,
or human resources directors regarding accommodation of employees with physical
disabilities.”RFP No. 8: “All DOCUMENTS used by
DEFENDANT within the past five (5) years in training of its officers,
shareholders, supervisors, managers, associate managers, associate supervisors,
or human resources directors regarding the providing of leaves of absence to
DEFENDANT’s employees.” RFP No. 9: “All DOCUMENTS used by
DEFENDANT within the past five (5) years in training of its officers,
shareholders, supervisors, managers, associate managers, associate supervisors,
or human resources directors regarding discrimination or prevention of
discrimination in relation to employees with physical disabilities or employees
on medical leave.” RFP No. 10: “All DOCUMENTS RELATING to
DEFENDANT’s policy with respect to leaves of absence during PLAINTIFF’s
employment with DEFENDANT.” RFP No. 11: “All DOCUMENTS RELATING to
DEFENDANT’s policy with respect to disabled employees and/or employees with
physical disabilities, limited to the last 5 years.”RFP No. 12: “All DOCUMENTS RELATING to
DEFENDANT'S policy with respect to discrimination or prevention of
discrimination against employees with physical or mental disabilities or
employees on medical leave, limited to the last 5 years.”Defendant’s initial responses objected on
vagueness, overbreadth, and unduly burdensome grounds. Defendant’s initial
responses also claimed Plaintiff’s request included confidential trade secret
information. Defendant’s response limited Plaintiff’s request to the following:
“Defendant will produce its anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation policies,
and medical leaves of absence policies, including its procedures for reporting
discrimination and/or retaliation, that were operative during Plaintiffs
employment with Defendant that Defendant is able to locate in its possession,
custody and/or control after a reasonable search and diligent inquiry.” (Responses
to RFP Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.)Defendant’s supplemental response mirrored
the same objections as its initial response but included the following: “AFI
will produce all non-privileged responsive documents that it is able to locate
in its possession, custody, and/or control after a reasonable search and
diligent inquiry.” (Supplemental Responses to RFP Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.)The Court disagrees with Defendant’s
objections. The request is very clear in that it seeks all documents relating
to Plaintiff’s wages, compensation, and explicitly stated benefits Plaintiff
may have received during her employment with Defendant. Thus, the Court strikes
Defendant’s objections. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 and
orders Defendant to provide a Privilege Log listing all privileged documents
which are responsive to RFP Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. RFP No. 16RFP No. 16: “All DOCUMENTS reflecting
insurance policies and/or insurance coverage which DEFENDANT has or has had for
any claims alleged in this lawsuit.”(RFP
No. 16.)Defendant’s initial response objected on
vagueness, overbreadth, and unduly burdensome grounds. Defendant’s initial
responses also objected on the grounds of attorney client privilege, work
product doctrine, and confidential trade secret information. (Responses to RFP
No. 16.) Defendant’s supplemental response mirrored the objections in its
initial response and included the follow response: “After conducting a diligent
search and reasonable inquiry, AFI cannot comply with this request because
there are no non-privileged documents responsive to this request in AFI’s
possession, custody or control.” (Supplemental Responses to RFP No. 16.)
Defendant does not state whether there are privileged documents responsive to
this request. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 16 and orders Defendant to
provide a Privilege Log listing all privileged documents which are responsive

to PLAINTIFF including, but not limited to, PLAINTIFF’s PERSONNEL FILE and the
records PERTAINING to duties, salary, salary raise, promotions, evaluations,
discipline, benefits, discharge, layoff and retirement.”Defendant’s initial response objected on the
grounds of vagueness, overbreadth, undue burden, failure to describe with
reasonable particularity the items requested, and request seeks discovery for
an unlimited period of time. Defendant also responded as follows: “Defendant
will produce all non-privileged documents in Plaintiff’s personnel file that
Defendant is able to locate in its possession, custody or control after a
reasonable search and diligent inquiry.” (Responses to RFP No. 17.)Defendant’s supplemental response mirrored
its initial response and included the following: “[S]ubject to the parties’
agreement that “complete files” means “personnel file” and this request is
limited to Plaintiff’s job description for any position(s) she held; documents
sufficient to show any and all raises, bonuses, commissions; documents constituting
job performance evaluations; and documents pertaining to her discharge, AFI
responds as follows: AFI will produce all non-privileged responsive documents that
it is able to locate in its possession, custody, and/or control after a
reasonable search and diligent inquiry.” (Supplemental Responses to RFP No.
17.)Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 17 and orders Defendant to
provide a Privilege Log listing all privileged documents which are responsive
to RFP No. 17. RFP No.18RFP No. 18: “All DOCUMENTS constituting
communications between PLAINTIFF and DEFENDANT RELATED TO PLAINTIFF’S medical
condition(s).”Defendant’s initial response objected on
the grounds of vagueness, overbreadth, undue burden, failure to describe with
reasonable particularity the items requested, and request seeks discovery for
an unlimited period of time. Defendant also responded as follows: “Defendant
will produce all non-privileged documents mentioning the medical condition that
Plaintiff alleges she suffered from in the Complaint that Defendant is able to
locate in its possession, custody and/or control after a reasonable search and
diligent inquiry.” (Responses to RFP No. 18.) Defendant’s supplemental response contains
the same objections and includes the following: “AFI will produce all
non-privileged, responsive documents that AFI is able to locate in its
possession, custody and/or control after a reasonable search and diligent
inquiry.” (Supplemental Responses to RFP No. 18.)The Court disagrees with Defendant’s
objections. The request is very clear in that it seeks documents containing
communications between Plaintiff and Defendant about discussing Plaintiff’s
medical conditions. Thus, the Court strikes Defendant’s objections. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 18 and orders Defendant to
provide a Privilege Log listing all privileged documents which are responsive
to RFP No. 18. RFP No. 19RFP No. 19: “All DOCUMENTS RELATING to
PLAINTIFF which DEFENDANT contends satisfied its record keeping requirements
pursuant to California Labor Code Section 226.”Defendant’s initial response objected on
the grounds of vagueness, overbreadth, undue burden, and that the request calls
for a legal conclusion. Defendant also responded as follows: “Defendant will
produce Plaintiff’s W-2s for the period of her employment with Defendant from
2017 to 2020 that Defendant is able to locate in its possession, custody and/or
control after a reasonable search and diligent inquiry.” (Responses to RFP No.
19.) Defendant’s supplemental response mirrors its original objections and
includes the following: “AFI will produce all responsive, non-privileged
documents AFI is able to locate in its possession, custody and/or control after
a reasonable search and diligent inquiry.” (Supplemental Responses to RFP No.
19.) Defendant does not mention whether it has responsive privileged documents
in its possession.The Court disagrees with Defendant’s
objections and strikes each one. This request does not contain a legal
conclusion but asks Defendant to produce all documents it should keep on file
according to state law. Thus, the Court strikes Defendant’s objections.Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 19 and orders Defendant to
provide a Privilege Log listing all privileged documents which are responsive
to RFP No. 19.    RFP No. 20RFP No. 20: “All DOCUMENTS RELATING to and
copies of all of PLAINTIFF’s pay-stubs for earnings of PLAINTIFF during the
scope of PLAINTIFF’s employment with DEFENDANT.”Defendant’s initial response objected on
the grounds of vagueness, overbreadth, undue burden, and that the request calls
for a legal conclusion. Defendant also responded as follows: “Subject to and
without waiving the foregoing objections, Defendant responds as follows:
Defendant will produce Plaintiff’s W-2s for the years 2017 to 2020 that
Defendant is able to locate in its possession, custody and/or control after a
reasonable search and diligent inquiry.” (Responses to RFP No. 20.) Defendant’s
supplemental response mirrors its original objections and includes the following,
which is limited to all Plaintiff’s paystubs Defendant can find after a
reasonable search and diligent inquiry: “AFI will produce all responsive,
non-privileged documents AFI is able to locate in its possession, custody
and/or control after a reasonable search and diligent inquiry.” (Supplemental
Responses to RFP No. 20.)The Court disagrees with Defendant’s
objections and strikes them all. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 20 and orders Defendant to
provide a Privilege Log listing all privileged documents which are responsive
to RFP No. 20. RFP No. 21RFP No. 21: “All DOCUMENTS RELATING to
PLAINTIFF’s work schedule PERTAINING to PLAINTIFF’s employment with DEFENDANT.”Defendant’s initial response objected on
the grounds of vagueness, overbreadth, undue burden, confusion, ambiguity, and
that the request is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.” (Responses to RFP No. 21.) Defendant’s supplemental
response includes the same objections and the following: “AFI will produce all
non-privileged responsive documents that it is able to locate in its
possession, custody, and/or control after a reasonable search and diligent
inquiry.” (Supplemental Responses to RFP No. 21.) The Court disagrees with Defendant’s
objections. The request explicitly seeks documents related to Plaintiff’s work
schedule during Plaintiff’s employment with Defendant. Thus, the Court strikes
Defendant’s objections. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 21 and orders Defendant to
provide a Privilege Log listing all privileged documents which are responsive
to RFP No. 21. RFP No. 22RFP No. 22: “All DOCUMENTS signed by
PLAINTIFF in YOUR possession, custody or control.”Defendant’s initial response objected on
the grounds of vagueness, overbreadth, undue burden, confusion, ambiguity, and
that the request is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.” Additionally, Defendant responded that: “Defendant will
produce all non-privileged documents in Plaintiff’s personnel file that it is
able to locate in its possession, custody or control after a reasonable search
and diligent inquiry.” (Responses to RFP No. 22.) Defendant’s supplemental responses
include objections mirroring its initial objections and includes the following:
“AFI will produce responsive, non-privileged documents it is able to locate in
its possession, custody or control after a reasonable search and diligent
inquiry.” (Supplemental Responses to RFP No. 22.)The Court disagrees with Defendant’s
objections and finds Defendant’s response evasive. The request seeks all
documents Plaintiff signed while employed by Defendant. Thus, the Court strikes
Defendant’s objections.Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 22 and orders Defendant to
provide a Privilege Log listing all privileged documents which are responsive
to RFP No. 22. RFPs Nos. 24RFP No. 24: “Any and all DOCUMENTS

DEFENDANT, including but not limited to performance appraisals or evaluations,
commendations, reprimands, written warnings, documentation of verbal warnings,
awards, and/or letters of thanks, recognition or appreciation or any other
similar DOCUMENTS.”Defendant’s initial response objected on
the grounds of vagueness, overbreadth, undue burden, confusion, ambiguity, and
that the request is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.” Additionally, Defendant responded that: “Subject to and
without waiving the foregoing objections, Defendant responds as follows:
Defendant will produce all non-privileged responsive documents reflecting
evaluations or assessments of Plaintiff’s job performance that it is able to
locate in its possession, custody or control after a reasonable search and
diligent inquiry.” (Responses to RFP No. 24.) Defendant’s supplemental
responses include objections mirroring its initial objections and includes the
following: “AFI will produce all non-privileged responsive documents that it is
able to locate in its possession, custody or control after a reasonable search
and diligent inquiry.” (Supplemental Responses to RFP No. 24.)The Court disagrees with Defendant’s
objections. The request seeks documents related to Plaintiff’s job performance
and even lists examples of relevant document categories. Thus, the Court
strikes Defendant’s objections. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 24 and orders Defendant to
provide a Privilege Log listing all privileged documents which are responsive
to RFP No. 24. RFP No. 25RFP No. 25: “Any and all DOCUMENTS showing
or describing the position(s) held by PLAINTIFF and/or job duties performed by
PLAINTIFF during PLAINTIFF’s employment with DEFENDANT.” Defendant’s initial response objected on
the grounds of vagueness, overbreadth, undue burden, confusion, ambiguity, and
that the request is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence.” Additionally, Defendant responded that: “Defendant will
produce the offer letter Plaintiff signed upon her hire and the job description
for an AFI insurance sales agent, Plaintiff’s only position during her
employment with Defendant following her hire as a sales agent trainee, that
Defendant is able to locate in its possession, custody and/or control after a
reasonable search and diligent inquiry.” (Responses to RFP No. 25.) Defendant’s
supplemental response mirrors the same objections as its initial responses and
includes the following: “AFI will produce all non-privileged responsive
documents that it is able to locate in its possession, custody or control after
a reasonable search and diligent inquiry.” (Supplemental Responses to RFP No. 25.)The Court disagrees with Defendant’s
objections. The request explicitly seeks documents listing and describing
Plaintiff’s job titles and duties for each position while Plaintiff was
employed with Defendant. Thus, the Court strikes Defendant’s objections. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 25 and orders Defendant to
provide a Privilege Log listing all privileged documents which are responsive
to RFP No. 25. RFP No. 26RFP No. 26: “Any and all DOCUMENTS

of compensation earned by PLAINTIFF during PLAINTIFF’s employment with
DEFENDANT, including but not limited to wages, bonuses, stock options, deferred
compensation, pension benefits, retirement plans, medical or other insurance,
etc.”Defendant’s initial response objected on
the grounds of vagueness, overbreadth, undue burden, confusion, ambiguity, that
the request is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence, fails to describe with reasonable particularity the items requested
for inspection, and to the extent that it seeks information protected by the
attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine. Defendant
responded as follows: “Defendant will produce Plaintiff’s offer letter and W-2s
for the years 2017 to 2020 that Defendant is able to locate in its possession,
custody and/or control after a reasonable search and diligent Inquiry.”
(Responses to RFP No. 26.) Defendant’s supplemental response mirrors the same
objections as its initial responses and includes the following: “AFI will
produce all non-privileged responsive documents that it is able to locate in
its possession, custody or control after a reasonable search and diligent
inquiry.” (Supplemental Responses to RFP No. 26.)The Court disagrees with Defendant’s
objections. The request seeks all documents relating to Plaintiff’s wages,
compensation, and benefits Plaintiff may have received during her employment
with Defendant. Thus, the Court strikes Defendant’s objections. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 26 and orders Defendant to

hierarchical corporate structure of DEFENDANT, including but not limited to
organizational charts or graphs, showing, describing, explaining, PERTAINING or
showing or explaining the chain of authority or command above or below
PLAINTIFF.”Defendant’s initial response objected on
the grounds of vagueness, overbreadth, undue burden, confusion, ambiguity, and
that the request is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. (Responses to RFP No. 27.) Defendant’s supplemental
response, which is limited by the parties’ agreement to limit the request to
the Sales Center’s hierarchical, corporate structure, mirrors the same
objections as its initial response and includes the following: “AFI will
produce all non-privileged responsive documents that it is able to locate in
its possession, custody or control after a reasonable search and diligent
inquiry.” (Supplemental Responses to RFP No. 27.)Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 27 and orders Defendant to

constituting or RELATING to communications (whether written, oral or otherwise)
between DEFENDANT and PLAINTIFF regarding any need for medical leave by
PLAINTIFF during PLAINTIFF’s employment with DEFENDANT.”Defendant’s initial responses objected to
the request on the grounds that it is vague, confusing, ambiguous, overly
broad, unduly burdensome, irrelevant, not reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence, that it entitles Plaintiff to discovery for
an unlimited period of time, and that it fails to describe with reasonable
particularity the items requested for inspection. Defendant also responded as
follows: “Defendant will produce all non-privileged documents mentioning the
disability and/or medical condition that Plaintiff alleges she suffered from in
the Complaint that Defendant is able to locate in its possession, custody
and/or control after a reasonable search and diligent inquiry.” (Responses to

provide a Privilege Log listing all privileged documents which are responsive
to RFP No. 50. RFP No. 51RFP No. 51: “Any and all DOCUMENTS
constituting or RELATING to communications (whether written, oral or otherwise)
among DEFENDANT’S management regarding any of Plaintiff’s need for
accommodations.”Defendant’s initial response objected to
this request on the grounds that it is vague, confusing, ambiguous, overly
broad, unduly burdensome, irrelevant, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of admissible evidence. Defendant responded as follows: “Defendant
will produce all non-privileged documents constituting requests for medical
leave by Plaintiff to Defendant related to the disability and/or medical
condition Plaintiff alleges she suffered from in the Complaint, and any
responses thereto by Defendant, that Defendant is able to locate in its
possession, custody and/or control after a reasonable search and diligent
inquiry.” (Responses to RFP No. 51.)Defendant’s supplemental response included
the same objections and the following: “[D]efining “need” to mean “request”,
AFI responds as follows: AFI will produce all responsive, non-privileged
documents it is able to locate in its possession, custody or control after a
reasonable search and diligent inquiry.” (Supplemental Responses to RFP No. 51.)The Court strikes Defendant’s objections
because they lack support. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 51 and orders Defendant to
provide a Privilege Log listing all privileged documents which are responsive
to RFP No. 51. RFP No. 52RFP No. 52: “All DOCUMENTS related to
DEFENDANT'S policy with respect to retaliation or the prevention of
retaliation, limited to the last five (5) years.”Defendant’s initial response objected to
this request on the grounds that it is vague, confusing, ambiguous, overly
broad, unduly burdensome, irrelevant, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of admissible evidence. Defendant responded as follows: “Defendant
will produce its anti-retaliation policies, including its procedures for
reporting retaliation, that were operative during Plaintiff’s employment with
Defendant that it is able to locate in its possession, custody, and/or control
after a reasonable search and diligent inquiry.” (Responses to RFP No. 52.) Defendant’s
supplemental response included the same objections and the following: “AFI will
produce all responsive, non-privileged documents it is able to locate in its
possession, custody or control after a reasonable search and diligent inquiry.”
(Supplemental Responses to RFP No. 52.)The Court strikes Defendant’s objections
because they lack support. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 52 and orders Defendant to
provide a Privilege Log listing all privileged documents which are responsive
to RFP No. 52. RFP No. 53RFP No. 53: “All DOCUMENTS RELATING to
DEFENDANT’s policy with respect to providing disabled employees with reasonable
accommodations.”Defendant’s initial response objected to
this request on the grounds that it is vague, confusing, ambiguous, overly
broad, unduly burdensome, irrelevant, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of admissible evidence. Defendant responded as follows: “Defendant
will produce its anti-discrimination policies, including its procedures for
reporting discrimination, that were operative during Plaintiff’s employment
with Defendant that it is able to locate in its possession, custody, and/or
control after a reasonable search and diligent inquiry.” (Responses to RFP No. 53.)Defendant’s supplemental response included
the same objections and the following: “Subject to and without waiving the
foregoing objections and subject to the parties’ agreement that the term
“RELATING TO” will mean “constituting”, AFI responds as follows: AFI will
produce all non-privileged responsive documents that it is able to locate in
its possession, custody, and/or control after a reasonable search and diligent
inquiry.” (Supplemental Responses to RFP No. 53.)Defendant has provided a sufficient
supplemental response.The Court strikes Defendant’s objections
because they lack support. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 53 and orders Defendant to
provide a Privilege Log listing all privileged documents which are responsive
to RFP No. 53.RFP No. 54RFP No. 54: “Please produce all DOCUMENTS
relating to DEFENDANT’S discipline policy.”Defendant’s initial response objected to
this request on the grounds that it is vague, confusing, ambiguous, overly
broad, unduly burdensome, irrelevant, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of admissible evidence. Defendant responded as follows: “Subject
to and without waiving the foregoing objections, Defendant responds as follows:
Defendant will produce its policies relating to discipline that were operative
during Plaintiff’s employment with Defendant that it is able to locate in its
possession, custody, and/or control after a reasonable search and diligent
inquiry.” (Responses to RFP No. 54.)Defendant’s supplemental response included

DEFENDANT’s rules and policies for its employees at any time during PLAINTIFF’s

this request on the grounds that it is vague, confusing, ambiguous, overly
broad, unduly burdensome, irrelevant, duplicative and overlaps with other
requests, seeks information protected by attorney-client privilege and work
production doctrine, seeks information in violation of third-party
constitutional rights to privacy, and not reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence. Defendant responded as follows: “Defendant
will produce its anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation policies, and medical
leaves of absence policies, including its procedures for reporting
discrimination and/or retaliation, that were operative during Plaintiff’s
employment with Defendant that Defendant is able to locate in its possession,
custody and/or control after a reasonable search and diligent inquiry.”
(Responses to RFP No. 55.)Defendant’s supplemental response included
the same objections and the following: “Subject to and without waiving the
foregoing objections, and following the parties’ agreement following a meet and
confer that this request will be limited to policies regarding medical leave
including FMLA leave, medical absences, discipline including progressive
discipline, attendance, performance evaluations,
anti-retaliation/discrimination, and complaint procedures . . . AFI
will produce all non-privileged responsive documents that it is able to locate
in its possession, custody, and/or control after a reasonable search and
diligent inquiry.” (Supplemental Responses to RFP No. 55.)The Court strikes Defendant’s objections
because they lack support. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 55 and orders Defendant to
provide a Privilege Log listing all privileged documents which are responsive
to RFP No. 55. RFP No. 56RFP No. 56: “Any and all DOCUMENTS or

that Defendant is able to locate in its possession, custody and/or control
after a reasonable search and diligent inquiry.” (Responses to RFP No. 56.) Defendant’s
supplemental response included the same objections and the following: “AFI will
produce all responsive, non-privileged documents it is able to locate in its
possession, custody or control after a reasonable search and diligent inquiry.”
(Supplemental Responses to RFP No. 56.)The Court strikes Defendant’s objections
because they lack support. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 56 and orders Defendant to
provide a Privilege Log listing all privileged documents which are responsive
to RFP No. 56.   RFP No. 57RFP No. 57: “Please produce all doctor’s
notes sent by PLAINTIFF to DEFENDANT.”Defendant’s initial response objected to
this request on the grounds that it is vague, confusing, ambiguous, overly
broad, unduly burdensome, irrelevant, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of admissible evidence. Defendant responded as follows: “Defendant
will produce all medical provider’s notes related to the disability and/or
medical condition Plaintiff alleges she suffered from in the Complaint provided
to Defendant that Defendant is able to locate in its possession, custody and/or
control after a reasonable search and diligent inquiry.” (Responses to RFP No. 57.)
Defendant’s supplemental response included the same objections and the
following: “AFI will produce all responsive, non-privileged documents it is
able to locate in its possession, custody or control after a reasonable search
and diligent inquiry.” (Supplemental Responses to RFP No. 57.)The Court strikes Defendant’s objections
because they lack support. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 57 and orders Defendant to
provide a Privilege Log listing all privileged documents which are responsive
to RFP No. 57. RFP No. 58RFP No. 58: “Please produce a copy of all
FMLA paperwork sent to PLAINTIFF.”Defendant’s initial response objected to
this request on the grounds that it is vague, confusing, ambiguous, overly
broad, unduly burdensome, irrelevant, and not reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of admissible evidence. Defendant responded as follows: “Defendant
will produce all paperwork Defendant sent to Plaintiff to fill out pertaining
to her request for medical leave related to the disability and/or medical
condition Plaintiff alleges she suffered from in the Complaint that Defendant
is able to locate in its possession, custody and/or control after a reasonable
search and diligent inquiry.” (Responses to RFP No. 58.)Defendant’s supplemental response included
the same objections and the following: “AFI objects to this request on the
grounds that the request is overbroad, vague and ambiguous with respect to the
phrase “FMLA paperwork. . . . Subject to and without
waiving the foregoing objections, AFI responds as follows: AFI will produce all
responsive, non-privileged documents it is able to locate in its possession,
custody or control after a reasonable search and diligent inquiry.”
(Supplemental Responses to RFP No. 58.)The Court strikes Defendant’s objections
because they lack support. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 58 and orders Defendant to
provide a Privilege Log listing all privileged documents which are responsive
to RFP No. 58. RFPs No. 60RFP No. 60: “All W2 forms provided to
PLAINTIFF during her employment with DEFENDANT.”Defendant’s initial response objected to
this request on the grounds that it is vague, confusing, ambiguous, overly
broad, unduly burdensome, irrelevant, duplicative and overlaps with other
requests, seeks information protected by attorney-client privilege and work
production doctrine, seeks information in violation of third-party
constitutional rights to privacy, and not reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence. Defendant also responded as follows: “Defendant
responds as follows: Defendant will produce Plaintiff’s W-2s for the years 2017
to 2020 that Defendant is able to locate in its possession, custody and/or
control after a reasonable search and diligent inquiry.” (Responses to RFP No. 60.)Defendant’s supplemental response included
the same objections and the following: “AFI will produce all responsive,
non-privileged documents it is able to locate in its possession, custody or
control after a reasonable search and diligent inquiry.” (Supplemental
Responses to RFP No. 60.)The Court disagrees that this request is
duplicative because here, Plaintiff requests W-2s which were given to
Plaintiff, rather than the W-2s Plaintiff completed herself. The Court strikes
Defendant’s objections because they lack support. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
request to compel further responses to RFP No. 60 and orders Defendant to
provide a Privilege Log listing all privileged documents which are responsive
to RFP No. 60. Requests
for Monetary Sanctions1.     
Awarding SanctionsAs
to monetary sanctions, Defendant contends that Court should deny sanctions
because Defendant produced verified supplemental responses to Plaintiff’s
motion before the hearing. (Opposition, p. 19:9-12.) Courts shall
impose monetary sanctions “against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel further response to a
demand, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., ¶ 2031.310, subd. (h).) “If a party
provides an untimely interrogatory response that does not
contain objections and that sets forth legally valid responses to
each interrogatory, the untimely response might completely or
substantially resolve the issues raised by a motion to
compel responses under section 2030.290.” (Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 408-409.) The
Court finds Defendant did not act with substantial justification or that
circumstances make imposing sanctions unjust. Plaintiff initially served this
discovery request on Defendant in November 2023. After Defendant served its
initial responses, Plaintiff gave Defendant numerous extensions to submit adequate
supplemental responses. (Rodriguez Decl., ¶¶ 9-40.) Over the course of five
months, Plaintiff emailed with Defendant, had telephone calls with Defendant,
and clarified all Defendant’s concerns. Plaintiff reached out one last time on
June 26, 2024 to request another deadline extension to July 11, 2024. (Ordway
Decl., ¶¶ 10-11.) Frustrated with the constant back and forth, Plaintiff filed
this motion to compel supplemental responses on June 28, 2024. Defendant has
since completed four rounds of document production including the documents
produced with the this motion. (Ordway Decl., ¶¶ 21-22, 26.) But for Defendant
not sticking to the parties’ agreed upon deadline extensions, Plaintiff would
not have filed this motion. Defendants did not serve supplemental responses to
this RFP until October 14, 2024. The Court also notes that Plaintiff also
requests monetary sanctions against Defendant’s counsel of record for
repeatedly failing to stick to extension deadlines. The
Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to sanctions even though Defendant
served and filed supplemental responses prior to the hearing. Defendant’s
untimely responses contain objections and do not resolve all issues as the Court
has ordered Defendant to submit further responses. The Court therefore finds
monetary sanctions against Defendant and Defendant’s counsel of record are
proper because Plaintiff successfully made the motion.2.     
Plaintiff’s RequestPlaintiff
requests $3,600.00 in attorney’s fees and costs as monetary sanctions against
Defendant and Defendant’s counsel of record. Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate
is $450. (Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 46.) Plaintiff seeks to recover for eight hours: 5
hours for preparing and filing this motion; 1 hour for attending the hearing;
and anticipating 2 hour to review any opposition a prepare a reply brief.
(Rodriguez Decl., ¶ 46(a)-(c), (e).)The
Court finds Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate is reasonable, but the number of
hours Plaintiff seeks to recover is unreasonable. As of October 22, 2024,
Plaintiff’s counsel has not filed a reply brief. Additionally, the hearing on
this matter will likely last no more than 30 minutes and will take place at the
same time as two other related motion hearings. Accordingly, the Court finds it
reasonable to reduce the Plaintiff’s recoverable time as follows: 4 hours for
preparing and filing this motion; 0 hours for attending the hearing; and 1 hour
for reviewing the opposition. Thus, Plaintiff’s total reduced recoverable
amount in attorney’s fees and costs is $2,250 ([5 hour + 1 hours) x $450/hour).The
Court therefore GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions against
Defendant and Defendant’s counsel of record in the reduced amount of $2,250 in
attorney’s fees. The Court orders Defendant Answer Financial Inc. and its
counsel of record, jointly and severally, to pay $2,250 to Plaintiff Eliza
Suruchlian, through her counsel of record, within 20 days of the date of this
ruling.              It is so ordered.                                                                                                                                                Dated: October 30, 2024 _______________________MEL RED RECANAJudge of the
