And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling addresses five motions in limine filed by the Athletix defendants and Elias Aziz-Lavi. The Court denies the first motion, which seeks to exclude the expert testimony of C. Kerry Fields regarding the breach of fiduciary duty to Textile 26. The Court also denies the second motion, which seeks to exclude any testimony of Plaintiffs' experts regarding any damages allegedly caused by Aziz-Lavi's conduct.

The Court grants the motion to set aside or vacate the July 3, 2019 Discovery Sanctions Order against Aziz-Lavi, as the service of the subpoena was void on its face. The Court also denies the remaining three motions in limine, including those seeking to exclude evidence and argument regarding Elias Abiginesaz's individual claims, to limit the testimony of Plaintiffs' CPA expert Jennifer Ziegler-Benjamin, and to exclude Plaintiffs' conspiracy claims against Aziz-Lavi.

The Court rules that Fields will be allowed to testify on how Aziz-Lavi's conduct caused damage to Plaintiffs, but may not testify as to the law governing claims for breach of fiduciary duty. The Court will instruct the jury on that law.
