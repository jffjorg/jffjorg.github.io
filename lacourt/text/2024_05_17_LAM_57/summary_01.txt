And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies Bernards Builders, Inc.'s (Bernards) motion for leave to amend its First Amended Complaint (FAC) without prejudice. The court denies the motion on two procedural grounds. First, Bernards moved under Code of Civil Procedure Section 428.50, which governs leave to file permissive cross-complaints, but Bernards intended to move under Section 426.50, which addresses leave to amend complaints. Second, Bernards' supporting declaration does not comply with Rule of Court 3.1324, which requires a separate declaration specifying the effect of the amendment, why it is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered, and the reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The court notes that failure to comply with Rule 3.1324 may be grounds to deny a motion for leave to amend. However, the court gives Bernards the opportunity to re-file the motion with a compliant supporting declaration, and notes that the strong policy in favor of allowing leave to amend may result in the court granting the motion if Bernards addresses the procedural defects.
