  Case Number:  22STCV00763    Hearing Date:   May 17, 2024    Dept:  57 Bernards Builders, Inc.'s ("Bernards") motion for leave to amend its First Amended Complaint ("FAC") is denied without prejudice on two procedural grounds.  First, Bernard's notice of motion states that Bernards is moving for leave to amend its FAC under Code of Civil Procedure Section 428.50.  By its terms, however, Section 428.50 governs motions to file permissive cross-complaints.  (Crocker National Bank v. Emerald (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 852, 864.)  The FAC is not a cross-complaint.  It appears from Bernards' memorandum in support of the motion that Bernards intended to move for leave to amend the FAC under Section 426.50, which address leave to amend complaints under certain circumstances and is cited in the memorandum, along with precedent applying that provision.  Bernards' memorandum also cites precedent under Section 473(a), a provision addressing leave to amend complaints under certain other circumstances.  Put another way, it does not appear that Bernards intended to move under Section 428.50.  But that is what Bernards moved under.  The Court cannot grant Bernards leave to amend the current iteration of its complaint under a provision that deals with leave to amend cross-complaints.    Second, under Rule of Court 3.1324, a motion for leave to amend a pleading must be accompanied by a separate declaration that specifies the following :  "(1) The effect of the amendment; (2)  Why the amendment is necessary and proper;(3)  When the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) The reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier."  (Rule of Court 3.1324.)  The supporting declaration of Bernards' counsel that accompanied its motion for leave to amend the FAC does not comply with these specifications.  Failure to comply with Rule 3.1324 may be grounds to deny a motion for leave to amend.  (Hataishi v. First American Home Buyers Protection Corp.  (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1454, 1468-1469.)  As indicated, the Court is denying Bernards' motion without prejudice.  It should be fairly simple for Bernards to address the procedural defects set forth herein through another motion and supporting declaration.  If Bernards does that, the Court likely would grant that motion in light of the strong policy in favor of allowing leave to amend.  (Board of Trustees v. Superior Court (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1163 [applying Section 473(a)]; (Silver Organizations Ltd. v. Frank (1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 94, 99 [applying Section 426.50].)
