 Case Number:  BC720469    Hearing Date:   May 17, 2024    Dept:  57 MOTION
IN LIMINE # 2 OF THE ATHLETIX DEFENDANTS TO PRECLUDE TESTIMONY, STATEMENTS AND
OPINIONS OF PLAINTIFFS’ EXPERT WITNESS C. KERRY FIELDS
The Motion
is DENIED because it sweeps too broadly. The Motion seeks to exclude in its
entirety Fields’s expert testimony regarding Hersel Abiginesaz’s alleged breach
of fiduciary duty to Textile 26 and Elias Abiginesaz.  But that relief is broader than what is
countenanced by the precedent on which the Motion rests, Amtower v. Photo
Dynamics, Inc. (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1582.  The Court of Appeal in Amtower did not
entirely preclude expert testimony regarding the breach of fiduciary claim that
was asserted in that case.   Rather, the Court of Appeal left standing the
trial court’s ruling in that case that plaintiff’s expert could testify as to
how the defendant breached his fiduciary duty to plaintiff.  Here, Fields will be allowed to testify along
those lines.  Fields may not, however,
testify as to the law governing claims for breach of fiduciary. The Court will
instruct the jury on that law.  Fields
also will be allowed to testify on how Athletix was the continuation of Textile
26 such that Hersel owed continued fiduciary duties to Textile 26 after the
formation of Athletix.
MOTION
IN LIMINE # 3 OF THE ATHLETIX DEFENDANTS TO EXCLUDE EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT REGARDING
PLAINTIFF ELIAS ABGINESAZ’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS THAT ARE DUPLICATE OF TEXTILE
26’S
The Motion
is DENIED.  The Motion presumes that Elias’s
claims for damage are derivative of Textile’s 26’s.   The Court cannot make that presumption at the
motion in limine stage.  The Athletix Defendants
should have moved for summary adjudication on whether Elias’s claims for
damages are derivate of Textile 26’s and not waited for the motion in limine
stage.
MOTION
OF ELIAS AZIZ-LAVI TO VACATE OR SET ASIDE THE JULY 3, 2019 DISCOVERY SANCTIONS
ORDER AGAINST AZIZ-LAVI
The Motion
is GRANTED.  
Code of
Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d) provides this Court with the
authority,¿ upon motion by a party or upon the Court’s own motion, to set aside
any void order.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (d) [“The court may, upon
motion of the injured party, or its own motion, correct clerical mistakes in
its judgment or orders as entered, so as to conform to the judgment or order
directed, and may, on motion of either party after notice to the other party,
set aside any void judgment or order.”].)¿ Only “void” orders may be set aside
under Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d), as opposed to
voidable orders.¿ (Ibid.)¿¿¿ “There is no time limit to attack a
judgment [or order which is] void on its face.”¿ (Pittman v. Beck Park
Apartments Ltd. (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 1009, 1021.)¿ An order is considered
“void on its face” where “the invalidity is apparent from an inspection of the
judgment roll or court record without consideration of extrinsic evidence.”¿ (Ibid.;
see OC Interior Services, LLC v. Nationstar Mortgage, LLC (2017) 7
Cal.App.5th 1318, 1327 [“[t]o prove that the judgment is void [on its face[,
the party challenging the judgment is limited to the judgment roll, i.e., no
extrinsic evidence is allowed”].)¿ 
CCP
§2020.220 (b) states that “any person may serve [a] subpoena by personal
delivery of a copy of it as follows: (1) If the deponent is a natural person,
to that person; (2) If the deponent is an organization, to any officer,
director, custodian of records, or to any agent or employee authorized by the
organization to accept service of a subpoena.” (CCP §2020.220 (b).)  CCP §2020.220 (c) further states that
“personal service of any deposition subpoena is effective to require all of the
following of any deponent who is a resident of California at the time of service:(1)
Personal attendance and testimony, if the subpoena so specifies. (2) Any
specified production, inspection, testing, and sampling; (3) The deponent's
attendance at a court session to consider any issue arising out of the
deponent's refusal to be sworn, or to answer any question, or to produce
specified items, or to permit inspection or photocopying, if the subpoena so
specifies, or specified testing and sampling of the items produced.” CCP
§2020.220 (c).) 
Defendant
Aziz-Lav’s Motion to Set Aside or Vacate the July 3, 2019, Order is granted because
service of the subpoena that led to the entry of that Order is void on its
face.  The proof of service of the subpoena
shows that Aziz-Lavi purportedly was served 
by substitute service on the Custodian of Records for Elias Aziz-Lavi
CPA.  The problem is that Aziz-Lavi is
natural person and not a corporation. Therefore, Aziz-Lavi did not have a
custodian of records and he was not personally served as required by CCP
§2020.220 (b).  
 MOTION
IN LIMINE # 1 OF DEFENDANT ELIAS AZIZ-LAVI TO EXCLUDE DISCOVERY SANCTIONS ORDERS
The Motion
is DENIED because it is rendered moot by the Court’s ruling granting Aziz-Lavi’s
separate Motion to Vacate the July 3, 2019 Discovery Sanctions Order Against
Aziz-Lavi.
MOTION
IN LIMINE # 2 OF DEFENDANT ELIAS AZIZ-LAVI TO EXCLUDE ANY TESTIMONY OF PLAINTIFFS’
EXPERTS REGARDING ANY DAMAGES ALLEGEDLY CAUSED BY AZIZ LAVI’S CONDUCT AND/OR
THE AMOUNT OF ANY SUCH DAMAGES
The Motion
is DENIED because it sweeps too broadly. 
The Motion seeks to preclude Plaintiffs’ CPA expert Jennifer Ziegler-Benjamin
from testifying that Aziz-Lavi, who is alleged to be a joint
conspirator/tortfeasor, caused damage to Plaintiffs.  Benjamin did not testify at her deposition as
to the amount of damages to Plaintiffs that could be apportioned to Aziz-Lavi's
conduct.  But Plaintiffs are not seeking
to apportion damages between and among Aziz-Lavi and the other Defendants, and thus
Benjamin will not be testifying to that. 
This does not mean that Benjamin should be precluded from testifying as
to how Aziz-Lavi's conduct caused damage to Plaintiffs.  Aziz-Lavi's Motion in Limine # 3 would
improperly bar that line of testimony.
MOTION
IN LIMINE # 4 OF DEFENDANT ELIAS AZIZ-LAVI TO EXCLUDE PLAINTIFFS’ CONSPIRACY
CLAIMS AGAINST AZIZ-LAVI
The Motion
is DENIED because it is, in essence, a dispositive motion by Aziz-Lavi on the Plaintiffs’
claims against him.  Trial courts have
discretion to decline to exclude evidence based on a motion in limine that functions
as a dispositive motion. (Tung v. Chicago Title Co. (2021) 63
Cal.App.5th 734, 740.)  In the Court’s
view, Aziz-Lavi could have, well in advance of the trial, sought the relief
through a dispositive motion that he is seeking through this motion in limine.
MOTION
IN LIMINE # 5 OF DEFENDANT ELIAS-AZIZ-LAVI TO LIMIT THE TESTIMONY OF PLAINTIFFS’
CPA EXPERT JENNIFER ZIEGLER-BENJAMIN WITH RESPECT TO AZIZ-LAVI’S ALLEGED BREACH
OF FIDUCIARY DUTY
The MOTION is
DENIED.  The Motion is based on the
proposition that Plantiffs have not sued Aziz-Lavi for breach of fiduciary
duty.  That is correct.  The Motion is nevertheless denied because it
sweeps too broadly in that it would preclude Plaintiffs’ CPA Expert Benjamin
from testifying as to Aziz-Lavi’s breach of the fiduciary duty of care he owed
to Plaintiffs, which is part and parcel of the Plaintiffs’ negligence claim
against Aziz-Lavi.
