And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to quash the service of summons. The defendants argue that the service of summons was made at an incorrect address, which belongs to the Office of the Attorney General of California. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to show that the California Attorney General is a "clerk, secretary, president, presiding officer, or other head" of the Department of State Hospitals. The court also notes that the Department of State Hospitals is a separate entity from the State of California. As a result, the motion to quash the service of summons is granted, and the defendants are directed to give notice.
