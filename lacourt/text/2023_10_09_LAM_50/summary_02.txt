English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the demurrer and motion to strike portions of the complaint filed by defendant Transunion Rental Screening Solutions, Inc. (TURSS). The complaint alleges that TURSS and other defendants violated the Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (ICRAA) by obtaining investigative consumer reports about plaintiffs without complying with the mandatory requirements. The Court overrules TURSS's demurrer to the first and third causes of action, but sustains the demurrer to the second cause of action for invasion of privacy. The Court grants TURSS's motion to strike paragraph 61 of the complaint, but denies the motion to strike other paragraphs. The Court orders plaintiffs to file an amended complaint, if any, within 20 days of the date of the order.
