And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Plaintiff Douglas A. Bagby to compel Defendant Joseph Daniel Davis to return $3.5 million transferred to Nevis Island LLC and to issue additional orders against Defendants pending trial. The judge has denied the motion, finding that Plaintiff has not adequately demonstrated the grounds for issuance of the requested orders in the notice of motion and that the motion is premature as it was filed before the operative Second Amended Complaint was filed. The judge also notes that Plaintiff has not specifically referenced any of Plaintiff's causes of action in the instant motion and that the burden is on the party seeking injunctive relief to show all elements necessary to support issuance of a preliminary injunction. The judge orders Plaintiff to provide notice of this ruling.
