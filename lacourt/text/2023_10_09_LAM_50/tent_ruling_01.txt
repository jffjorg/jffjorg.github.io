TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:
 
MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE



 
Background
On April
25, 2022, Plaintiffs Janet Haywood (“Haywood”) and 8424 Western Plaza LLC filed
this action against Defendants Stephen Cho and Creative Recovery Concepts
(jointly, “Defendants”). On February 9, 2023, Haywood filed the operative FAC
in this action against Defendants, alleging causes of action for (1) breach of
contract, (2) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and
(3) conspiracy to commit fraud. 
On
September 10, 2020, Creative Recovery Concepts, Inc. filed an action entitled Creative
Recovery Concepts, Inc. v. 8424 Western Plaza, LLC, et al., Case No.
20STCV34671 (the “CRC Action”). 
On
July 25, 2023, the Court issued a minute order providing, inter alia,
that “[t]he Court finds that the following cases, 22STCV13629 and 20STCV34671,
are related within the meaning of California Rules
of Court, rule 3.300(a). 20STCV34671 is the lead case. For good cause
shown, said cases are assigned to Judge Teresa A. Beaudet in Department 50 at
Stanley Mosk Courthouse for all purposes.”
M. Stephen Cho, Esq., erroneously sued as Stephen Cho (herein, “Cho”) now moves for an order
consolidating the instant action and the CRC Action for all purposes. The motion is
unopposed. 
Discussion
Code of Civil Procedure section 1048 grants
discretion to trial courts to consolidate actions involving common questions of
law or fact. “Consolidation
is not a matter of right; it rests solely within the sound discretion of the
trial judge. . .” (Fisher v. Nash
Bldg. Co. (1952) 113 Cal.App.2d 397, 402.) There are two types of consolidation under section 1048: “a consolidation for purposes of trial
only, where the two actions remain otherwise separate; and a complete
consolidation or consolidation for all purposes, where the two actions are
merged into a single proceeding under one case number and result in only one
verdict or set of findings and one judgment.” (Hamilton v.
Asbestos Corp. (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1127, 1147.) “The purpose is to enhance trial court efficiency (i.e., to
avoid unnecessary duplication of evidence and procedures); and to avoid the substantial
danger of inconsistent adjudications (i.e., different results because tried
before different juries, or a judge and jury, etc.).” (Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civ. Proc. Before
Trial (The Rutter
Group 2022) ¶ 12:340.) 
The Instant Case – Janet Haywood v. Stephen
Cho, et al. (Case No. 22STCV13629) 
            As set forth above,
in the FAC in the instant case, Haywood alleges cause of action for (1)
breach of contract, (2) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing, and (3) conspiracy to commit fraud. 
            In the FAC, Haywood alleges that in
2017, she retained Cho to represent her in a lawsuit filed in the Los Angeles
County Superior Court known as “Genus v.
Haywood,” a dispute arising out of an improved parcel of residential property
owned and/or controlled by Haywood and located at 10427 S. Denker Avenue, Los
Angeles, California (the “Denker Property”). (FAC, ¶ 7.) Haywood alleges that
Cho “aggressively litigated the case, in the process conducting elaborate
unnecessary Discovery as well as engaging in unnecessary litigation activities
that were not prudent given the ‘big picture’ economic constraints of the
litigation, with the legal fees increasing exorbitantly with the passing of
each month…” (FAC, ¶ 8.) 
            Haywood alleges that
Cho “pressured and coerced [Haywood] to participate…in a Settlement
Conference,” and that during the Settlement Conference, Haywood “caved into the
active efforts of [Cho] to induce if not compel [Haywood] to settle the
dispute…” (FAC, ¶ 11.) Haywood further alleges that Cho falsely informed
Haywood that she “faced the prospect of being incarcerated by the trial judge”
if Haywood did not relinquish her interest in the Denker Property for the
amount of $650,000.00. (FAC, ¶ 12.) 
Haywood further alleges that after the
settlement was memorialized, Cho “passed off his large Bill for attorneys fees
to [Creative Recovery Concepts], who aggressively sought payment of the
attorneys fees from [Haywood]…” (FAC, ¶ 14.) Haywood alleges that “[t]he
Draconian collection actions of [Creative Recovery Concepts] confirmed
[Haywood’s] suspicions that the reason that [Cho] racked up such and [sic]
exorbitant amount of unnecessary attorneys fees when he intended to induce
settlement was because [Cho] was overtly engaging in actions to manifest the and
act out a [conspiratorial scheme] to use [Creative Recovery Concepts] to
collect aggressively his exorbitant and worthless attorneys fees…” (FAC, ¶15.) 
 
The CRC Action – Creative Recovery Concepts, Inc. v. 8424 Western
Plaza, LLC, et al. (Case No. 20STCV34671)
In the CRC Action, Creative Recovery Concepts,
Inc. filed a Complaint against Defendants 8424 Western Plaza, LLC and Kathleen
Janet Haywood aka Kathleen Robinson, alleging causes of action for (1) breach
of contract and (2) to set aside fraudulent transfer. The Complaint alleges
that “[o]n or about May 23, 2018 Defendant, 8424 Western Plaza, LLC entered
into a written agreement with Plaintiffs Assignor,” which is attached as
Exhibit “1” to the Complaint. (Compl., ¶ 6, Ex. 1.) The agreement attached as
Exhibit “1” to the Complaint is titled “Legal Engagement,” and provides, inter
alia, that “[w]e are pleased that you have selected CKB VIENNA, LLP to
represent 8424 Western Plaza LLC (‘Client’) in connection with Genus v. 8424
Western Plaza (Case No. BC 706314).” (Compl., ¶ 6, Ex. 1.) The agreement is
signed by Stephen Cho on behalf of CKB Vienna LLP. (Ibid.)
Creative Recovery Concepts, Inc. alleges that “[o]n or about November 2, 2019
Defendant breached the agreement by failing to make payment for the legal
services incurred in the sum of $46,484.57.” (Compl., ¶ 7.) 
Creative Recovery Concepts, Inc. further
alleges that “[t]he Defendant through its Managing Member, Kathleen Janet
Haywood aka Kathleen Robinson had full knowledge that Plaintiff intended to
make all efforts to collect the balance due its assignor including filing a
lawsuit.” (Compl., ¶ 11.) “On April 20, 2020 a Grant Deed was recorded with the
Los Angeles County Recorder…whereby 8424 Western Plaza, LLC purportedly made a
bona fide gift of the real property located at 8424 South Western Avenue, Los
Angeles, California 90047 to Kathleen Janet Haywood aka Kathleen Robinson.”
(Compl., ¶ 14.) Creative Recovery Concepts, Inc. alleges that “[t]his deed was
made with full knowledge of Plaintiff’s claim and will full [sic] knowledge and
intent to hinder, delay and/or defraud Plaintiff as a creditor of 8424 Western
Plaza, LLC from the ability to enforce the claim and potential judgment against
the principal asset of 8424 Western Plaza, LLC.” (Compl., ¶ 14.) 
            Consolidation 
            Cho asserts that the instant action and the CRC Action “should be consolidated because the cases are related; both matters pertain to legal fees billed by Mr. Cho to Ms.
Haywood and paid in part by Ms. Haywood. The [instant] action challenges fees charged by Mr. Cho to Ms. Haywood
and alleges that Mr. Cho conspired with
CRC to collect the fees owed to Mr. Cho.” (Mot. at p.
3:5-9.) Cho asserts that the underlying issue is
the amount of legal fees charged by Mr. Cho to Haywood and 8424 Western Plaza LLC, and that “[a]s such
there are common questions of law and fact in both cases which are pending in
this same court, warranting consolidation under Code of Civil Procedure
[section] 1048(a) for all purposes.” (Mot. at p. 7:16-18.) Cho asserts that
judicial economy and convenience will be served by consolidation. 
The Court agrees with Cho
that the instant action and the CRC Action involve common questions fact. Based
on the foregoing, the Court finds it appropriate to consolidate the two
actions.
Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, the Court
grants Cho’s motion to consolidate.  
Cho is ordered to give notice of
this ruling.
