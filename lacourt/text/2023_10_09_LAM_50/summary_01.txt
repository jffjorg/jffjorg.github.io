Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to consolidate two related cases, Case No. 22STCV13629 (the "Instant Case") and Case No. 20STCV34671 (the "CRC Action"). The Instant Case was filed by Janet Haywood against Stephen Cho and others, alleging causes of action for breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and conspiracy to commit fraud. The CRC Action was filed by Creative Recovery Concepts, Inc. against 8424 Western Plaza, LLC and others, alleging causes of action for breach of contract and to set aside fraudulent transfer.

The Court finds that the two cases involve common questions of law and fact, and that consolidating the cases will serve the purposes of judicial economy and convenience. The Court grants the motion to consolidate the cases for all purposes.
