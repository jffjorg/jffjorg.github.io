English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer and a motion to strike in a lawsuit filed by Summer Hopkins against Omid Vesal, M.D., dba “IRVINE URGENT CARE”, Carlos Ernesto Monge, and Does 1 through 10.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer as to the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Causes of Action, which alleged disability discrimination, failure to accommodate, failure to engage in the interactive process, and retaliation, respectively. The Judge found that the Complaint did not sufficiently plead a qualifying disability, nor did it plead Defendants' knowledge of the disability.

The Judge has also granted the motion to strike paragraphs 43 and portions of paragraph 60 in the Complaint, which sought punitive damages. The Judge found that the allegations did not state a prima facie claim for punitive damages and that the corporate Defendant IUC cannot be directly liable for punitive damages unless it is shown that the corporation had advance knowledge of the unfitness of its employee, Monge, and employed him with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others. However, the Judge imputed liability for punitive damages on IUC as Monge is a managing agent of IUC.
