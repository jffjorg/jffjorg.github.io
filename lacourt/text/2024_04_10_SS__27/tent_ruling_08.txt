On March 28, 2024, the
Parties attended an IDC and resolved the discovery disputes at issue.
Defendant's counsel was ordered to provide further responses by electronic mail
to Plaintiff by April 8, 2024. The motions to compel further were subsequently
continued to April 10, 2024. The Court notes that the motions have not been
taken off calendar. Thus, the Court will hear from the Parties on the status of
the production of further responses, specifically whether Defendant's counsel
has provided the agreed-upon further responses by electronic mail to Plaintiff
by April 8, 2024, unless the parties agree that no such hearing is necessary.
