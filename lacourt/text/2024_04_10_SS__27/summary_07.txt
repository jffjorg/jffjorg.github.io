Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The tentative ruling is about a motion to quash an amendment to a complaint filed by the plaintiff, Mahdad Seyd Berenji, against Peterberg Construction, Inc. The plaintiff alleged that he fell from a ladder while working as a subcontractor for Peterberg Construction on October 16, 2020. He filed a complaint on October 5, 2022, and an amendment to the complaint on February 7, 2024, adding Peterberg Construction as a defendant. The defendant moved to quash the amendment, arguing that the plaintiff knew of Peterberg Construction's identity before filing the complaint and failed to amend the complaint for two years. The court found that the plaintiff had knowledge of Peterberg Construction's identity and failed to amend the complaint in a timely manner. Therefore, the court granted the defendant's motion to quash the amendment.
