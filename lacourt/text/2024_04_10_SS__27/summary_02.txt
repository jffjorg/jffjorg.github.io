And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel responses to special interrogatories and for sanctions. The plaintiff responded to the special interrogatories with objections, which are considered timely under California law, even without verification. The defendant's motion for sanctions is also denied. The judge notes that the plaintiff's responses were not verified, but since they consisted solely of objections, they were timely. The defendant is required to meet and confer with the plaintiff before filing a motion to compel further. The case will proceed to a hearing on April 10, 2024, for oral argument.
