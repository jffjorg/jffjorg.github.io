And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Melkon Chamichyan, moved the court to compel the plaintiff, Natalie Moore, to provide discovery responses. The defendant served his form interrogatories and request for admissions on October 2, 2023, but the plaintiff failed to serve discovery responses by November 3, 2023. The defendant provided the plaintiff with extensions to serve the discovery responses, but the plaintiff still failed to do so. The defendant moved the court to compel the plaintiff to provide discovery responses and to deem the content of the defendant's request for admissions admitted.

The court granted the defendant's motion to compel discovery responses and deemed the content of the defendant's request for admissions admitted. The court also ordered the plaintiff to provide verified discovery responses within 20 days. The court denied the defendant's request for terminating sanctions, as there was no evidence of the plaintiff's prior sanctions or history of discovery abuses.

The court noted that the plaintiff recently became pro per and may need guidance on how to handle her own lawsuit. The court warned that if the plaintiff fails to comply with the orders contained in the ruling, more severe sanctions may be warranted.
