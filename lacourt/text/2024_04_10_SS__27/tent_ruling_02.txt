Hearing Date:                4/10/2024 at 1:30 p.m.
Case No./Name.:         22STCV07583 DERRYL MINNER vs DAVID REYES
Motion Name:                MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET THREE,
AND FOR SANCTIONS
Moving Party:                 Defendant Postmates, LLC
Responding Party:      Plaintiff
Notice:                                Sufficient
 
Ruling:                               MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO SPECIAL
INTERROGATORIES, SET THREE, AND FOR SANCTIONS IS DENIED.
 
 
On March 2, 2022, Plaintiff filed the present
auto accident case. On February 7, 2024, Defendant Postmates served its Special
Interrogatories, Set Three, on Plaintiff. On March 12, Plaintiff served timely
discovery responses, consisting of only objections. On March 15, Defendant
moved the court to compel initial responses, arguing that Plaintiff’s responses
are not timely because they are unverified. However, the party to whom the
interrogatories are directed shall sign the response under oath unless the response
contains only objections. (CCP 2030.250(a).) Since Plaintiff’s responses
consist solely of objections, they were timely, even without verifications.
Should Defendant take issue with Plaintiff’s objections, Defendant is required
to meet and confer and then attend an informal discovery conference (IDC)
before filing a motion to compel further. Defendant’s motion for sanctions is
likewise denied for the reasons above.
