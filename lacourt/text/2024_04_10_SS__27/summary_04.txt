And here is the summary in English text:

This tentative ruling denies the Defendant's motion to compel responses to special interrogatories and for sanctions. The Plaintiff filed an auto accident lawsuit on March 2, 2022, and the Defendant served special interrogatories on February 7, 2024. The Plaintiff responded with objections on March 12, 2024, which the Defendant argued were untimely. However, the court ruled that the Plaintiff's responses were timely despite lacking verification, as required by CCP 2030.250(a). The Defendant's motion for sanctions was also denied for the same reasons. The court set the hearing for April 10, 2024, and parties are required to submit any objections or arguments by email.
