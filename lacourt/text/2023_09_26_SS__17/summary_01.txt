Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Walter Pearce v. Gardena Retirement Center, Inc. dba Gardena Retirement Center. The defendant has moved to quash two subpoenas for records from the Community Care Licensing Division (CCLD) related to the plaintiff's injury in the bathtub. The court has denied the motion to quash, but has narrowed the scope of the subpoenas to July 1, 2021 to March 1, 2022.

The court has found that the CCLD records are relevant to the case and necessary for discovery, and that the defendant's arguments that the subpoenas are overbroad and seek privileged materials are not persuasive. The court has also found that the records can be redacted and deleted to protect privacy concerns, and that there is no violation of HIPAA.

The court's ruling is based on California Code of Regulations, section 87303, which requires facilities to maintain hot water controls in faucets and bathtubs to prevent scalding. The court has also relied on Government Code section 6253, which requires state and local agencies to make public records available to the public.

The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court by 4 p.m. the day prior to the hearing, as directed by the instructions provided on the court website. If all parties submit, the court will adopt this tentative as the final order.

**Case Number:** 23STCP00500

**Plaintiff:** Walter Pearce

**Defendant:** Gardena Retirement Center, Inc. dba Gardena Retirement Center

**Hearing Date:** September 26, 2023

---

Walter Pearce (Plaintiff) filed a lawsuit on February 21, 2023, against Gardena Retirement Center, Inc. dba Gardena Retirement Center (Defendant), alleging dependent adult abuse/neglect and negligence. The Defendant moved to quash two subpoenas for Community Care Licensing Division (CCLD) records.

Pearce was a resident at the Defendant's facility and alleges that he was scalded by hot water on February 26, 2022, due to the facility's failure to comply with temperature regulations. The subpoenas sought CCLD records from January 1, 2019, to present, but the court narrowed the scope to July 1, 2021, to March 1, 2022.

Defendant argued that the subpoenas were overbroad, irrelevant, and sought privileged materials. However, the court found the requests to be discoverable under the limited scope. The court considered relevancy, scope, privilege, and privacy concerns. The court determined that the requested records were relevant to establish whether the Defendant was aware of its non-compliance with temperature regulations.

The court found that methods such as redaction and de-identification of health information could mitigate privacy concerns. Additionally, the court determined that there was no violation of HIPAA, Civil Code section 56.10, or CCP section 1798.24.

Based on these findings, the Defendant's motions to quash are denied, and the scope of the subpoenas is narrowed to July 1, 2021, to March 1, 2022.

**Judge:** Hon. Jon R. Takasugi
