And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to stay the lawsuit pending the outcome of the Nazar Action will be continued to a date after October 3, 2023. This is because the judge wants to wait for Judge Long's ruling on the Notice of Related Cases, which may determine whether the two lawsuits are related or should be consolidated. The judge notes that the issues in the two lawsuits are substantially identical, and that a stay would not be lengthy or undermine judicial economy. However, the judge also acknowledges that a stay may be appropriate if the Nazar Action renders moot or narrows many of the plaintiff's claims.
