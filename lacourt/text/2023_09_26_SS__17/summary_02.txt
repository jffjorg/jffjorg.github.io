## English Text Summary

The judge in this case has tentatively decided to continue the hearing on a motion to stay the case until after October 3, 2023. This is because a related case involving similar issues is scheduled for trial in October, and a decision in that case may impact the outcome of this one. 

The judge is waiting for another judge to rule on whether this case is related to the other case. If they are deemed related, the judge in this case may consolidate the two cases.

If the cases are not related, the judge will likely grant a stay in this case until the related case is resolved. A stay would prevent the court from making decisions that could be contradicted by the outcome of the related case.

## English Summary

The judge in this case is postponing his decision on whether to delay the case (stay it) until after October 3rd, 2023. This is because another lawsuit involving similar issues is pending trial in a different department. The judge is waiting to see if the two cases will be related and potentially consolidated. 

The Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against several Defendants claiming they have the right to use a specific toll-free number. The Defendants are challenging the lawsuit and asking the judge to delay it until another lawsuit (the Nazar Action) is resolved. The Nazar Action also involves the same toll-free number and similar claims.

The judge believes it's prudent to wait for a decision in the related case before deciding whether or not to delay this case.

### English-Text Summary
The judge's tentative ruling in the case of The Dominguez Firm, LLP et al. v. Jose Luis Nazar et al. (Case No. 23STCV15315) is to continue the hearing to a date after October 3, 2023, to allow for Judge Long's ruling on the Notice of Related Cases.

The court finds that the issues in this case are substantially identical to those in another case, the Nazar Action, which is set for trial on October 23, 2023. The court exercises its discretion to continue the hearing, as a stay would mitigate the risk of conflicting rulings and would not be lengthy. The court's decision is based on the consideration that the Nazar Action may render moot or substantially narrow many of the plaintiffs' claims.

**Roles:** Plaintiffs, Defendants, Judge

**Significant Statements:**

* "Granting a stay in a case where the issues in two actions are substantially identical . . . is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court." (Thomson v. Continental Ins. Co. (1967) 66 Cal.2d 738, 746.)
* "In opposition, Plaintiff argues that a stay will undermine judicial economy. However, here, it is possible that the Nazar Action may render moot, or otherwise substantially narrow, many (if not all) of Plaintiffs’ claims."

This tentative ruling grants the application to be admitted pro hac vice and continues the hearing until after October 3, 2023, to allow for Judge Long’s ruling on the Notice of Related Cases.
