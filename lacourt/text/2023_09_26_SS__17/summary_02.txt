The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to stay the lawsuit pending the outcome of the Nazar Action will be continued to a date after October 3, 2023. This is because the judge wants to wait for Judge Long's ruling on the Notice of Related Cases, which may determine whether the two lawsuits are related or should be consolidated. The judge notes that the issues in the two lawsuits are substantially identical, and that a stay would not be lengthy or undermine judicial economy. However, the judge also acknowledges that a stay may be appropriate if the Nazar Action renders moot or narrows many of the plaintiff's claims.

## English Text Summary

The judge in this case has tentatively decided to continue the hearing on a motion to stay the case until after October 3, 2023. This is because a related case involving similar issues is scheduled for trial in October, and a decision in that case may impact the outcome of this one. 

The judge is waiting for another judge to rule on whether this case is related to the other case. If they are deemed related, the judge in this case may consolidate the two cases.

If the cases are not related, the judge will likely grant a stay in this case until the related case is resolved. A stay would prevent the court from making decisions that could be contradicted by the outcome of the related case.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of The Dominguez Firm, LLP, et al. v. Jose Luis Nazar, et al. The ruling continues the hearing to a date after October 3, 2023, to allow for Judge Long's ruling on the Notice of Related Cases. The judge does not reach the merits of the demurrer or the request to stay, but instead exercises discretion to continue the hearing. The lawsuit involves a dispute over the ownership and rights to the toll-free number 800-777-7777, with the plaintiffs seeking to protect their right to use the number and the defendants seeking to dismiss or stay the lawsuit. The judge notes that the issues in this case are substantially identical to those in another case, the Nazar Action, which is scheduled for trial on October 23, 2023. The judge finds it prudent to withhold a ruling until Judge Long has had an opportunity to determine whether the two cases are related or should be consolidated. If the cases are found to be related or consolidated, the motion to stay may be moot.
