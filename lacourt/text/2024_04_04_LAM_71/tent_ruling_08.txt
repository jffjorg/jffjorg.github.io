[1] The Court notes the Declaration of Brooks skips from
paragraph 5 to paragraph 8 and omits paragraphs 6 and 7.
 


[2] The Court notes ¶13 of the Declaration of Brooks
includes conflicting requests for the number of hours sought on the instant
motion.  Brooks declares the following: “I
have spent at least four (3) hours preparing this fee motion. I
anticipate spending an additional four (5) hours in connection with
reviewing/anallzing [sic] the anticipated opposition to this attorney fee
motion; preparing a reply; appearing at the hearing on this motion; and
preparing a notice of entry of this Court’s order on this motion.”  (Decl. of Brooks ¶13, emphasis added.)  
 
The Court relied on the
numbers included in parentheticals to calculate the attorneys fees sought on
this motion, as they reflect the total values sought (i.e., 44.3 hours –
36.3 hours = 8 hours; 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours.).  (See Decl. of Brooks ¶¶5, 14, Exh. B.)  
 
The Court reminds
Hovsepian’s counsel to proofread his papers before filing them with the Court.
