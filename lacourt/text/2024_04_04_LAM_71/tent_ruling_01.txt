WESLEY ROBBINS,  
  
        
  vs.
 
CARL SHAFF, II, et al.


 Case
  No.:  21STCV03788
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  April 4, 2024



 
Defendants Lionel Pereira’s and Southern California
Coin and Stamps’ motion for summary judgment of pro per Plaintiff
Wesley Robbins’ 7th cause of action in his second amended complaint is
denied.  
Defendants Lionel Pereira’s and Southern
California Coin and Stamps’ motion in the alternative for summary adjudication
of the 1st, 2nd, 7th, 12th, and 15th causes of action in his second amended
complaint is denied.
 
Defendants
Lionel Pereira (“Pereira”) and Southern California Coin and Stamps (“SCCA”)
(collectively, “Moving Defendants”) move for summary judgment of pro
per Plaintiff Wesley Robbins’ (“Robbins”) (“Plaintiff”) 7th and
12th causes of action in
his second amended complaint.  (Notice
Motion; C.C.P. §§437c, 437c(f).)[1]  The Court notes Moving Defendants’ demurrer
to the 12th cause of action was sustained without leave to amend on March 23,
2023.  Therefore, the only remaining
cause of action against Moving Defendants is the 7th cause of action.  (See 3/23/23 Minute Order (Ruling on
Submitted Matter).)
 
CRC
Violations
CRC, Rule 3.1350(d) provides that when
multiple causes of action, issues or defenses are presented for summary
adjudication in one motion, each cause of action, issue or defense to
which the motion is directed must have a separate section heading indicating
the issue number and specifying the issue. The headings must be followed by
two columns.  (CRC, Rule 3.1350(d),
emphasis added; see CRC, Rule 3.1350(h) [illustrating format for
separate statements in a motion for summary adjudication].)  Failure to comply with the requirements for
filing a separate statement may in the trial judge’s discretion constitute a
sufficient ground for denial of the motion.  (C.C.P. §437c(b)(1).)
Moving Defendants’ separate statement is in violation of CRC, Rule 3.1350(d) because it fails to identify each
cause of action in its separate statement for its motion for summary
adjudication as a separate section heading indicating the issue number and
specifying the issue.  Accordingly,
Moving Defendants’ motion for summary adjudication is denied on the basis its
separate statement is defective. 
However, the Court will rule on Moving Defendants’ motion for summary
judgment as to the 7th cause of action.
 
Background
Plaintiff filed his initial Complaint on January 29,
2021.  Plaintiff filed his first amended
complaint (“FAC”) on January 14, 2022. 
Plaintiff filed the operative SAC on November 14, 2022, alleging
thirteen causes of action: (1) civil conspiracy, (2) fraud (I), (3) tortious interference
(I), (4) defamation, (5) invasion of privacy, (6) trespass, (7) conversion, (8)
tortious interference (II), (9) fraud (II), (10) gross negligence, (11)
appropriation, (12) intentional infliction of emotional distress (“IIED”), and
(15) receipt of stolen property.[2]
On March 23, 2023, the Court sustained Moving Defendants’
demurrers to the 2nd and 12th causes of action alleged against Moving
Defendants and overruled Moving Defendants’ demurrers to the 1st, 7th, and 15th
causes of action on the basis Moving Defendants were only named in the prayer
for damages, and not in the substantive causes of action.  For whatever this Court’s rulings may seem to
indicate, the only existing cause of action factually alleged against Moving
Defendants is the 7th cause of action.
Moving Defendants filed the instant motion on January 23,
2024, with a second notice of errata on January 24, 2024, including a
reformatted separate statement.  Since
the separate statement attached to Moving Defendants’ second notice of errata
does not allege new facts and only reformats the columns to be in compliance
with the requirements in CRC, Rule 3.1350, the Court will consider the motion
for summary judgment.  Plaintiff filed
his opposition to the motion, without substantively opposing the motion on the
merits on March 8, 2024.  Moving
Defendants filed their reply on March 21, 2024.
 
Legal
Standard
A
motion for summary judgment shall be granted if all the papers submitted show
that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving
party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.  (C.C.P.
§437c(c).) 
 
Conversion (7th COA)
“Conversion
is the wrongful exercise of dominion over the property of another. The elements
of a conversion are: (1) the plaintiff’s ownership or right to possession of
the property at the time of the conversion; (2) the defendant’s conversion by a
wrongful act or disposition of property rights; and (3) damages. It is not
necessary that there be a manual taking of the property; it is only necessary
to show an assumption of control or ownership over the property, or that the
alleged converter has applied the property to his own use.”  (Farmers Insurance Exchange v. Zerin
(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445, 451-452.)
Moving
Defendants argue they did not engage in any wrongful act or dispose of any
property right.  (Motion Memo, pg. 10.)
Moving Defendants
submitted evidence that on May 22, 2018, Brandon Vidal (“Vidal”) visited SCCA
with 3-4 boxes of stamps (“Vidal Collection”) and Vidal got the boxes from an
unknown individual who said he inherited the stamps from his grandfather.  (Defendants’ Undisputed Separate Statement of
Fact [“D-USSF”] 3-4.)  The evidence
Moving Defendants submit in support of this proposition is hearsay evidence
from the Declaration of Colin Schmitt, who claims to attach a declaration
signed by Brandon Vidal as an exhibit, in which Vidal attests to the truth of
the matters asserted.  Vidal’s
declaration is unsigned and includes a second page that is blurry and purports
to be signed by Vidal.  
Regardless
of the admissibility of the proffered evidence, the Court is not convinced that
Moving Defendants submitted evidence that as a matter of law, they are bona
fide purchasers of the Vidal Collection. 
(D-USSF 10-11, 15.)  That Moving
Defendants accepted the Vidal Collection from Vidal who received them from an
unknown individual who purported to inherit them from his grandfather does not constitute
taking for value without notice of the fraud. 
Rather, knowledge of such facts and circumstances would have put
cautious and prudent men on inquiry.  (See
Regent Alliance Ltd. v. Rabizadeh (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 1177, 1184, citing
Oakdale Village Group v. Fong (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 539, 546 as
modified on denial of reh’g (Apr. 10, 1996).)  Therefore, Moving Defendants failed to meet
their burden to demonstrate that they are entitled to summary judgment on the
7th cause of action as a matter of law.
Accordingly,
Moving Defendants’ motion for summary judgment is denied.
 
Conclusion
Moving
Defendants’ motion for summary judgment of the 7th causes of action is denied. 
Moving
Defendants’ motion for summary adjudication is denied. 
Moving
Party to give notice.
