The judge has granted Raymond Hovsepian's motion for attorneys' fees and costs in the total amount of $27,170.00. This amount consists of $26,580.00 in attorneys' fees and $570.00 in costs. The motion was brought in response to Hovsepian's successful Anti-SLAPP motion, which struck Plaintiff Jaydon Douglas Paull's cause of action for abuse of process. The court has determined that Hovsepian is entitled to recover attorneys' fees and costs as the prevailing party in the Anti-SLAPP motion. The court has also denied Plaintiff's opposition to Hovsepian's motion for attorneys' fees, finding that Plaintiff's objections were insufficient.
