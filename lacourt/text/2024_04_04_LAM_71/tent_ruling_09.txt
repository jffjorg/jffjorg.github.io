 Hearing Date:  April 4, 2024



 
Defendant 821
Traction FM LLC’s demurrer to Plaintiff Juicerie VII, LLC’s complaint is sustained
as to the 2nd and 3rd causes of action with 20 days leave to amend and
overruled as to the 1st cause of action.
 
          Defendant 821 Traction FM LLC (“821 Traction”) (“Defendant”)
demurs to the complaint (“Complaint”) of Plaintiff Juicerie VII, LLC (“Juicerie”)
(“Plaintiff”) on the grounds that the 2nd and 3rd causes of action fail to state
facts sufficient to constitute viable causes of action against it, and the 1st
cause of action is uncertain.  (Notice of
Demurrer, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§430.10(e), (f).)
 
Meet
and Confer
Defendant’s counsel declares
she met and conferred telephonically with Plaintiff’s counsel on February 28,
2024, however the parties were unable to reach an agreement as to the
deficiencies raised by the demurrer. 
(Decl. of Pérez ¶3.). Defendant’s counsel’s declaration is proper;
therefore, the Court will consider Defendant’s demurrer.
 
Background
On December 21, 2023, Plaintiff
filed its operative Complaint against Defendant alleging three causes of action:
(1) declaratory relief, (2) recission, and (3) anticipatory breach of lease,
arising from Plaintiff’s tenancy at real property located at 821 Traction
Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90021 (“Premises”), leased by Defendant.  (See Complaint ¶¶1-2, 9.)  
Defendant filed the instant
demurrer on March 6, 2024.  Plaintiff
filed its opposition on March 21, 2024. 
Defendant filed its reply on March 27, 2024.
 
Summary of Allegations
Plaintiff alleges it entered
into a lease agreement (“Lease”) with Defendant on January 31, 2022, for
Plaintiff to open and operate a Butcher’s Daughter restaurant.  (Complaint ¶9, Exh. 1.)  Plaintiff alleges as reflected on the Lease’s
Exhibit B, Defendant was require to substantially complete the landlord work (including
receipt of a certificate of occupancy for the Building, or its legal equivalent
allowing Plaintiff to commence construction of the Tenant Improvements, and
allowing Plaintiff to legally occupy the Premises for the Permitted Use
following Plaintiff’s completion of the Tenant Improvements and receipt of any
required governmental approvals relating to the Tenant Improvements), and only
upon those occurrences did the “Delivery Date” occur. (Complaint ¶10.)  Plaintiff
alleges the Lease Commencement Date is defined in the Lease as 120 days after
the “Delivery Date.”  (Complaint ¶10.) 
Plaintiff alleges upon such
delivery, the Premises was required to be in good working order and condition,
and in compliance with applicable laws, including the ADA, to the extent
required to allow the legal use of the Premises for the Permitted use upon Plaintiff’s
receipt of permits for and completion of the Tenant Improvements in the
Premises, and free of Hazardous Materials in violation of applicable laws.  (Complaint ¶11.)  Plaintiff alleges as of the date this
complaint is filed, the Delivery Date has not occurred due to various
incomplete items for which Defendant is responsible.  (Complaint ¶12.)  Plaintiff alleges for example, the Premises
is not ADA compliant.  (Complaint ¶13.)  Plaintiff alleges parts of landlord’s “delivery
conditions” have also not been fulfilled. 
(Complaint ¶13.)  Plaintiff
alleges that as required before the “Delivery Date,” Plaintiff has not
completed its Tenant Improvements due, in part, to Defendant’s refusal to
provide the Tenant Improvement funds. 
(Complaint ¶14.)
Plaintiff alleges it began
its Tenant Improvement work, has already expended over $200,000 in various
expenses related to the Tenant Improvement work, and submitted a reimbursement
package on or about July 14th and followed-up with all information and documents
on July 25th.  (Complaint ¶15.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant, on or about
August 8, 2023, informed Plaintiff that “TI should be approved and transferred
by the end of next week.”  (Complaint
¶16.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant’s
representation was false.  (Complaint
¶16.)  
Plaintiff alleges Defendant, on
the other hand, contends the “Delivery Date” occurred in December 2022 solely
based on Landlord obtaining a certificate of occupancy.  (Complaint ¶17.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant, however, was
mistaken in that this is but just one of the items required of Defendant as
alleged above in ¶10.  (Complaint
¶17.)  Plaintiff alleges in response to Defendant’s
multiple demands for rent payments or else face the consequences, although not
yet due, Plaintiff remitted rent payments in June, July, August, and September
2023 as an accommodation and under protest.  (Complaint ¶18.)  Plaintiff alleges, however, it stopped making
rent payments after understanding that Defendant had failed to satisfy the
“Delivery Conditions” and didn't have the right in the first instance to demand
rent payments.  (Complaint ¶18.)  
Plaintiff alleges on October
20, 2023, it informed Defendant that because Defendant was not allowing the
Tenant Improvement Allowance, Plaintiff would exercise its right to offset rent
against the Tenant Improvement Allowance under paragraph 2.3 of the Lease’s
Exhibit B.  (Complaint ¶19.)  Plaintiff alleges it stated: “Want to call to
your attention section 2.3 Exhibit B - let this email serve as second notice.
To the extent Landlord fails to pay from the Tenant Improvement Allowance amounts
due to Tenant in accordance with the terms thereof, and such amounts remain
unpaid for thirty days after notice from Tenant, then without limiting Tenant’s
other remedies under the Lease, Tenant may, after Landlord’s failure to pay
such amounts within five business days after Tenant’s delivery of a second
notice from Tenant delivered after the expiration of such 30-day period, pay
the same and deduct the amount thereof from the Rent.”  (Complaint ¶19.)
Plaintiff alleges in response
Defendant indicated through counsel that an unlawful detainer action would be
filed immediately, or as of December 20, 2023.  (Complaint ¶20.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant, through counsel,
issued a “Three-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit” and a second “Three-Day Notice
to Cure or Quit” with respect to an estoppel certificate that was not delivered
according to the “notice” provisions in the Lease.  (Complaint ¶20.) 
 
Summary of Demurrer
In support of its demurrer to
Plaintiff’s Complaint, Defendant argues the 2nd and 3rd claims fails to allege
facts sufficient to constitute viable causes of action against it, and the 1st
cause of action is uncertain.  (Demurrer,
pg. 3; C.C.P. §§430.10(e), (f).)
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal
sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  A demurrer can be used only to challenge
defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from matters
outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Insurance Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994
[ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider declarations, matters not
subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted for the truth of their
contents].)  For purposes of ruling on a
demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed to be true, but the
reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of law.  (Aubry
v. Tri-City Hospital District (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Failure to State a Claim
Recission (2nd COA)
The
grounds for rescission and the procedure by which parties may rescind their
contract are governed by Civil Code §§1688, et seq.  (Wong v. Stoler (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th
1375, 1384.)  “[A] party to a contract
cannot rescind at his pleasure, but only for some one or more of the [seven]
causes enumerated in section 1689 of the Civil Code.”  (Nmsbpcsldhb v. County of Fresno (2007)
152 Cal.App.4th 954, 959.)  
Pursuant
to Civil Code §1689(b)(1), a party to a contract may rescind the contract “[i]f
the consent of the party rescinding, or of any party jointly contracting with
him, was given by mistake, or obtained through duress, menace, fraud, or undue
influence, exercised by or with the connivance of the party as to whom he rescinds,
or of any other party to the contract jointly interested with such party.”   (Civ. Code §1689(b)(1).)
Plaintiff
alleges it believed that the Tenant Work Letter, Exhibit B to the Lease,
controlled the “Delivery Date” and when the Lease Commencement Date would be
triggered.  (Complaint ¶24.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant, on the other
hand, contends the Delivery Date occurred in December 2022 notwithstanding that
the delivery conditions had not been satisfied. 
(Complaint ¶25.)  
Plaintiff
alleges it expended significant funds with respect to its tenant improvement
work, all without receipt of the Tenant Improvement Allowance of $330,995.  (Complaint ¶26.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant represented on or
about August 8, 2023, that the Tenant Improvement Allowance would be paid in
mid-August 2023, but Defendant’s representation was false, made with the intent
that Plaintiff rely on it, which Plaintiff reasonably did, because Plaintiff
did not have any grounds to contest Defendant’s false representations about
when the Tenant Improvement Allowance would be paid.  (Complaint ¶27.)  Plaintiff alleges its reliance was reasonable
and justified.  (Complaint ¶28.)  Plaintiff alleges based on that reliance, Plaintiff
continued to fund the Tenant Improvement work without receiving any of the
promised $330,995 in Tenant Improvement Allowance.  (Complaint ¶28.)  
Plaintiff
alleges Plaintiff and Defendant are required to restore each other to the same
position they were in prior to January 31, 2022.  (Complaint ¶29.)
With
regard to mutual mistake, Plaintiff fails to allege that both parties were
mistaken as to any material matter.  (Civ.
Code §1577 [“Mistake of fact is a mistake . . . consisting in: [¶] 1. An
unconscious ignorance or forgetfulness of a fact past or present, material to
the contract; or, [¶] 2. Belief in the present existence of a thing material to
the contract, which does not exist, or in the past existence of such a thing,
which has not existed.”]; Wood v. Kalbaugh (1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 926, 932
[“It is settled that to warrant a unilateral rescission of a contract because
of mutual mistake, the mistake must relate to basic or material fact . . . .”].)  Plaintiff alleges what it believed regarding
the Tenant Work Letter and the Delivery Date, and what Defendant now contends,
not what Defendant believed at the time the parties entered into the Lease
regarding the Delivery Date.  (See
Complaint ¶24.)  
“A
‘mutual’ mistake is one made by both parties as to the same proposition.” (See
1 Miller and Starr Cal. Real Est. §1:135 [4th ed.].)  “Because one or the other may have been
mistaken does not constitute mutuality of mistake; and does not constitute
ground for rescission for mutual mistake.”  (Wood v. Metzenbaum (1951) 107
Cal.App.2d 727, 730-731; see also Harding v. Robinson (1917) 175 Cal.
534, 541-542; Miller v. Lantz (1937) 9 Cal.2d 544, 548.)  Parties having differing interpretations of a
contract does not constitute a “mistake” for rescission purposes.  (See, e.g., Hedging Concepts, Inc.
v. First Alliance Mortgage Co. (1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1410, 1421.)
With
regard to fraud, Plaintiff does not allege fraud in the inducement.  Rather, Plaintiff alleges a fraudulent
misrepresentation made on August 8, 2023, more than 1.5 years after the
parties entered into the Lease on January 31, 2022. (See Complaint ¶¶9,
27.)  Fraudulent inducement is a type of fraud
that occurs when one party misrepresents information or makes false statements
to another party to convince them to enter into a contract. The fraud that
justifies rescission must induce the making of the contract.  (See Crow v. Kenworthy (1939) 30
Cal.App.2d 313, 315; Wong, 237 Cal.App.4th at pg. 1388 [“[A] single
misstatement as to a material fact, knowingly made with intent to induce
another into entering the contract, will, if believed and relied on by that other,
afford a complete ground for rescission. . . .].)
Accordingly,
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s 2nd cause of action is sustained with
20 days leave to amend.
 
Anticipatory
Breach of Lease (3rd COA)
“If
a party to an obligation gives notice to another, before the latter is in
default, that he will not perform the same upon his part, and does not retract
such notice before the time at which performance upon his part is due, such
other party is entitled to enforce the obligation without previously performing
or offering to perform any conditions upon his part in favor of the former
party.”  (Civ. Code §1440.)
“Repudiation
of a contract, also known as “anticipatory breach,” occurs when a party
announces an intention not to perform prior to the time due for performance.”  (Stephens & Stephens XII, LLC v.
Fireman’s Fund Insurance Co. (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 1131, 1150.)  Anticipatory breach can be express or
implied: “An express repudiation is a clear, positive, unequivocal refusal to
perform; an implied repudiation results from conduct where the promisor puts it
out of his power to perform so as to make substantial performance of his
promise impossible.”  (Taylor v.
Johnston (1975) 15 Cal.3d 130, 137.)
Plaintiff
alleges the Lease contains a “Landlord Lease Restrictions” clause that
prohibits Defendant from leasing to any entity that will have a use identified
as a coffee shop, roaster, or café where coffee and tea beverages are
anticipated to make up more than 30% of total annual revenues.  (Complaint ¶31.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant, in violation of
this provision, has leased a larger portion of the Premises to an entity, of
which Defendant is the majority or controlling member, called Freemarket,
which, in turn, is anticipated to sub-lease a portion of Freemarket’s space to “Concierge
Coffee.”  (Complaint ¶32.)  
Plaintiff
alleges when it requested information about Concierge Coffee to ascertain its effect
vis-à-vis the “Landlord Lease Restrictions” clause, Defendant and its counsel
refused to provide any salient information and only concluded that Concierge
Coffee, despite its name, will not exceed to anticipated total annual revenue
threshold.  (Complaint ¶33.)  Plaintiff alleges Defendant’s actions
constitute an anticipatory breach of the Lease that will cause Plaintiff damage
and completely obliterate the “Landlord Lease Restrictions” clause.  (Complaint ¶34.)  Plaintiff alleges it is entitled to rescind
the Lease based on Defendant’s anticipatory breach of the Lease and/or obtain
damages for Defendant’s breach in an amount subject to proof.  (Complaint ¶35.)
Plaintiff
fails to allege that any repudiation occurred, specifically, that Defendant
expressly refused to perform under the Lease, or that it has “put it out of [its]
power to perform so as to make substantial performance of [its] promise
impossible.”  (Taylor, 15 Cal.3d
at pg. 137.)  Plaintiff fails to allege
that Concierge Coffee is anticipated to make up more than 30% of total
annual revenues in coffee and tea beverages. 
(See Complaint ¶¶32-33.) 
Further, Plaintiff fails to allege that it is operating its business at
the Premises, which is necessary to trigger §5.3 of the Lease.
Accordingly,
Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s 3rd cause of action is sustained with
20 days leave to amend.
 
Uncertainty
Declaratory
Judgment (1st COA)
A
demurrer for uncertainty will be sustained only where the complaint is so bad
that defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., he or she cannot reasonably
determine what issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are
directed against him or her.¿ (Khoury v. Maly’s of California, Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)¿¿ 
If
the complaint contains enough facts to apprise defendant of the issues it is
being asked to meet, failure to label each cause of action is not ground for
demurrer: “Although inconvenient, annoying and inconsiderate, the lack of
labels . . . does not substantially impair [defendant’s] ability to understand
the complaint.” (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185
Cal.App.3d 135, 139 n.2.)¿¿ 
Where
a demurrer is made upon this ground, it must distinctly specify exactly how or
why the pleading is uncertain, and where such uncertainty appears (by reference
to page and line numbers of the complaint).¿ (See Fenton v. Groveland
Community Services District (1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 797, 809.)¿¿ 
Plaintiff’s
pleading is not so bad that Defendant cannot reasonably determine what issues
must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed against
them.¿ (Khoury, 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)   
Plaintiff’s
claim for declaratory relief seeks to determine its rights and obligations
under the Lease.  (Complaint ¶21.)  Specifically, determinations of whether Plaintiff
can exercise its right to offset rent against the Tenant Improvement Allowance
under Lease Exhibit B ¶2.3, and whether the Delivery Date occurred in December
2022 because Defendant obtained a certificate of occupancy, or whether the
Delivery Date has yet to occur.  (See Complaint
¶¶12-20.)
Accordingly,
Defendant’s demurrer to the 1st cause of action on the basis of uncertainty is
overruled.¿ 
 
Conclusion
Defendant’s demurrer to
Plaintiff’s Complaint is sustained as to the 2nd and 3rd causes of action with
20 days leave to amend and overruled as to the 1st cause of action.
Moving Party to give notice.
