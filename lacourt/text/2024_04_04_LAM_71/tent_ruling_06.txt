 Hearing Date:  April 4, 2024



 
Defendant Raymond Hovsepian’s motion for attorneys’
fees against Plaintiff Jaydon Douglas Paull is
granted in the total amount of $27,170.00, comprised of $26,580.00 in
attorneys’ fees and $570.00 in costs.
 
Defendant
Raymond Hovsepian (“Hovsepian”) (“Defendant”) moves for an order awarding him
attorneys’ fees against Plaintiff Jaydon Douglas Paull (“Paull”) (“Plaintiff”) in
the total amount of $27,170.00.  (Notice
of Motion, pg. 1.)
 
Background
On December 5, 2023,
Plaintiff filed his operative complaint (“Complaint”) against Hovsepian and Defendants
Hasti Rahsepar (“Rahsepar”), HDR Law Group, Inc. (“HDR”), and Der Vartanian
(collectively, “Defendants”), alleging a single cause of action for abuse of
process against Hovsepian, with many other causes of action against non-moving
Defendants.  On March 12, 2024, this
Court granted Defendant’s special motion to strike (“Anti-SLAPP Motion”)
Plaintiff’s cause of action for abuse of process alleged against Hovsepian.  (3/12/24 Minute Order.)
On March 12, 2024, Hovsepian
filed the instant motion for attorneys’ fees. 
On March 21, 2024, Plaintiff filed his opposition.  On March 27, 2024, Hovsepian filed his reply.
 
Discussion
C.C.P.
§425.16(c)(1) provides, in part, “a prevailing defendant on a special motion to
strike shall be entitled to recover that defendant’s attorney’s fees and costs.”  California law makes the award of attorneys’
fees and costs to a prevailing anti-SLAPP defendant mandatory.  (See Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1131 [“[u]nder Code of Civil Procedure §425.16, subdivision (c), any
SLAPP defendant who brings a successful motion to strike is entitled to
mandatory attorney’s fees.”].)  Here, Hovsepian
was the prevailing party in the Anti-SLAPP Motion.  (See 3/12/24 Minute Order.)  Accordingly, Hovsepian’s motion for
attorneys’ fees is proper and he is entitled to recover attorneys’ fees and
costs.
 
Reasonable Fees
The California Supreme Court has determined
the lodestar method is the proper mechanism to calculate attorneys’ fees under
C.C.P. §425.16(c).  (See Ketchum, 24 Cal.4th at pg. 1136.)  To calculate a
lodestar amount, the Court must first determine the reasonableness of the
hourly rates sought by Defendant’s counsel.  The “reasonable hourly rate” applicable under
the lodestar method is the rate “prevailing in the community for similar work.”
(PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)  “The trial court makes its determination
after consideration of a number of factors, including the nature of the
litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in its
handling, the skill employed, the attention given, the success or failure, and
other circumstances in the case.”  (Id. at pg. 1096.)
Hovsepian’s Counsel declares his hourly rate
on this matter is $600.  (Decl. of Brooks
¶¶12.)  The Court determines based on its
experience that Hovsepian’s Counsel’s hourly rate is reasonable in his
community of practice.  (See Decl. of Brooks ¶¶10-12, Exh. C.)
An anti-SLAPP motion is complex in nature and requires the
submission of declarations and evidence akin to a motion for summary judgment
or a preliminary injunction.  Hovsepian argues the Anti-SLAPP motion in
the instant case was labor intensive due largely to the fact that the abuse of process
action was laid out over a 513 paragraph Complaint and followed a series of
litigated matters and implicated several other related lawsuits.  (Motion, pg. 7; Decl. of Brooks ¶9.)  Hovsepian argues this required his counsel to
review and analyze an underlying record in order to understand all of the
issues attendant to the Anti-SLAPP motion. 
(Motion, pg. 7.)  Hovsepian’s
efforts resulted in the dismissal of Plaintiff’s single cause of action alleged
against him.  Accordingly, Hovsepian’s
requested attorneys’ fees are reasonable.
 
Billed Hours
The verified time entries of the attorneys
are entitled to a presumption of credibility, which extends to an attorney’s
professional judgment as to whether time spent was reasonably necessary to the
litigation.  (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396 [“We think
the verified time statements of the attorney as officers of the court are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are erroneous.”].)
 “California courts do not require detailed
time records, and trial courts have discretion to award fees based on
declarations of counsel describing the work they have done and the court’s own
view of the number of hours reasonably spent.”  (Syers
Properties III, Inc. v. Rankin
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 698-699.) 
Here, the billing statement of Hovsepian’s counsel’s
fees and costs incurred on the motion and the declaration by counsel
demonstrates the reasonableness of the time spent on this case.  (See Decl. of Brooks ¶¶5-8, Exh. B.)[1]  Hovsepian
argues his counsel expended 36.3 hours litigating the anti-SLAPP motion, in
addition to three hours on the instant motion and includes five anticipated
hours in connection with reviewing and analyzing the opposition, preparing a
reply, appearing at the hearing, and preparing a notice of entry of this
Court’s order on the motion.  (See Decl. of Brooks ¶13.)[2]
Plaintiff’s arguments in opposition to Hovsepian’s
motion are unavailing because his objections to Hovsepian’s request for fees do
not point to the specific items challenged with sufficient arguments and
citations to the evidence; general arguments that fees claimed are excessive,
duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice. 
(Premier Medical Management
Systems, Inc. v. California Insurance Guarantee Association (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)
Accordingly, Hovsepian’s request for $26,580.00
in attorneys’ fees is granted.
 
Costs
Hovsepian seeks costs in the amount of $570.00.  (Decl. of Brooks ¶8.)  Defendant does not challenge Hovsepian’s request
for costs, and therefore the requested costs are granted pursuant to §425.16(c)(1).
 
Conclusion
Hovsepian’s
motion is granted in the total amount of $27,150.00, comprised of $26,580.00 in
attorneys’ fees and $570.00 in costs.
