Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted in part and denied in part the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant's demurrer to the second and third causes of action was sustained, and it was given 20 days' leave to amend. The demurrer to the first cause of action was overruled.

The plaintiff alleges that the defendant failed to substantially complete the landlord work, which includes obtaining a certificate of occupancy, and that the "Delivery Date" has not occurred. The defendant argues that the "Delivery Date" occurred in December 2022.

The court found that the plaintiff's second cause of action for recission was uncertain and failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute a viable cause of action. The court also found that the plaintiff's third cause of action for anticipatory breach of lease was uncertain and failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute a viable cause of action.

The court overruled the defendant's demurrer to the first cause of action for declaratory relief, finding that the complaint adequately stated a claim for declaratory relief.

The court's tentative ruling is subject to change based on further briefing and argument.
