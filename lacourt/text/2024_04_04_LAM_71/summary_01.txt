**Summary**

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for summary judgment brought by defendants Lionel Pereira and Southern California Coin and Stamps (SCCA) in the case of Wesley Robbins against Carl Shaff, Lionel Pereira, and Southern California Coin and Stamps (Case No. 21STCV03788). The defendants had moved for summary judgment on the 7th cause of action, which alleges conversion of property. The court has denied the motion, finding that the defendants failed to demonstrate that they are entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. The court has also denied the defendants' motion for summary adjudication on the 1st, 2nd, 7th, 12th, and 15th causes of action. The court's ruling is based on the defendants' failure to comply with the requirements for filing a separate statement in support of their motion. The court has also examined the evidence presented by the defendants, including a declaration by Brandon Vidal, which the court has found to be hearsay and unreliable.
