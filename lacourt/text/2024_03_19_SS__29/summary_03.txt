Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted in part the motions to continue the trial, which were filed by Uber and Gomillion. The trial date has been continued to May 9, 2024. The judge has also reset the Final Status Conference and all expert discovery deadlines based on the new trial date. The judge has denied Gomillion's motion to continue trial based on the substitution of counsel, finding that the substitution was voluntary and not a good cause for a continuance. The judge has also considered the arguments of Uber regarding the need for additional time to complete expert discovery and has granted the motion to continue in part based on this showing.
