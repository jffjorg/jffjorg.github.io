And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to be relieved as counsel, filed by Plaintiff's counsel Michael J. Emrani. The motion is denied without prejudice. The plaintiff, Jane King, and two other plaintiffs, Gerard Bamuturaki Kato and George B. Kakuru, filed a complaint against the defendant, Morgan Whitsett Weston, on March 7, 2022, alleging motor vehicle negligence and general negligence causes of action. The plaintiff's counsel filed the motion to be relieved as counsel on February 21, 2024, but no opposition was filed. The judge notes that the court may order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other. The judge also notes that the determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. In this case, the motion is denied as moot as to two of the plaintiffs, Gerard Bamuturaki Kato and George B. Kakuru, who were dismissed on March 11, 2024. The motion is also denied because no order was filed by the plaintiff's counsel.
