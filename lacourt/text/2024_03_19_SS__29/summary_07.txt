And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to compel plaintiff's responses to the request for production (set one) filed by defendant Jason Fladlien. The judge finds that the plaintiff, Nancy Michelle Simon Perez, failed to provide any response to the request for production, which was served on June 6, 2023. The judge notes that the plaintiff did not oppose the motion to compel, and therefore, the motion is granted. The judge also denies the defendant's request for sanctions, citing the California Supreme Court's review of the case City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC, which held that sections 2023.010 and 2023.030 of the Code of Civil Procedure do not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery. The judge orders the plaintiff to serve verified, code-compliant written responses, without objection, to the defendant's requests for production (set one) within 21 days of notice.
