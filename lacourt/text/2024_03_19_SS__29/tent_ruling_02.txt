Rent-A-Car, Company, EAN Holding, and Does 1 to 25 for motor vehicle negligence
and general negligence causes of action arising from an automobile accident

Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or substituted
at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon request by
either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other. (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where conflicts
between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
On February 15,
2024, Counsel filed the motion, declaration and proposed order to be relieved
as counsel. However, no service of this motion has been filed in regard to
Defendants Enterprise Rent-A-Car Company of Los Angeles, LLC, and EAN Holdings,
LLC, in accordance with Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).
As service has
not been made on all parties who have appeared in this case, the motion is
DENIED.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice.
Moving counsel
to give notice.
