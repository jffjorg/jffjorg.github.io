 Case Number:  KC069375    Hearing Date:   January 31, 2024    Dept:  K Plaintiff Classic
Maritime, Inc.’s Motion for Leave to File a Fourth Amended Verified Complaint
is granted, in part, and denied, in part.
Background   
Plaintiff Classic Maritime, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) alleges as
follows:
Under a contract of affreightment dated
June 29, 2009 (the “2009 COA”), Limbungan Makmus Sdn Bhd (“Limbungan”) agreed
to ship, and Plaintiff agreed to provide vessels to carry, 51 cargoes of iron
ore pellets from Tubarao or Ponta Ubu I Braxil to Port Kelang or Labuan in
Malaysia between 2009-2017. Limbungan’s obligations under the 2009 COA were
guaranteed by its parent company, Lion Diversified Holdings BHD (“Lion”)
pursuant to a written guarantee dated June 29, 2009 (the “2009 Guarantee”). On
June 30, 2014, Plaintiff and Limbungan executed an Addendum No. 1 to the 2009
COA which increased the number of shipments to 59. Likom Caseworks USA (“Likom
USA”) is a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Likom Caseworks Sdn Bhd (“Likom
Caseworks”) and a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Lion. Likom USA and Lion
are alter egos and, along with Likom Caseworks and Likom de Mexico, S.A.
de C.V. (“Likom Mexico”), operate as an integrated single enterprise. 
 
By mid-2016, Limbungan had breached its
obligations under the 2009 COA with respect to at least 4 “Index Shipments” and
3 “Scheduled Shipments,” which resulted in Plaintiff suing Limbungan and Lion
in a case styled Classic Maritime Inc. v. Limbungan Makmur Sdn Bhd and Lion
Diversified Holdings Bhd., Claim No. CL-2016-00421 (“English Action I”).
On September 13, 2018, judgment was handed down in English Action I. On
July 4, 2019, the Court of Appeal revised the lower court judgment in English
Action I. The judgment in English Action I is now final. 
 
Additionally, under the 2009 COA
Limbungan was required to declare laycans for 16 “Unscheduled Shipments” as
defined therein so that all of the Unscheduled Shipments fell in their entirety
before December 31, 2017. Limbungan breached the 2009 COA by failing to declare
laycans for 14 of the Unscheduled Shipments. Limbungan also made arrangements
with third parties for the carriage of certain Unscheduled Shipments in
violation of the 2009 COA. On May 30, 2018, Plaintiff filed a lawsuit against
Limbungan and Lion regarding the “Unscheduled Shipments” in a case styled Classic
Maritime Inc. v. Limbungan Makmur Sdn Bhd and Lion Diversified Holdings Bhd.,
Claim CL-2018-000352 (“English Action II”). 
 
Also, Limbungan owes delay damages to
Plaintiff in connection with a shipment it performed under the 2009 COA between
June-October 2013, employing the vessel Mineral Kyushu.
On March 3, 2020, Plaintiff filed a Third Amended Complaint,
asserting causes of action against Lion, Likom and Does 1-10 for:
1.                 
Recognition of Foreign-Country Judgment 
2.                 
Breach of Contract/Guarantee against Lion
3.                 
Alter Ego
On April 1, 2020, Lion filed a “Notice of Stay of
Proceedings,” advising therein of its Chapter 15 filing on March 18, 2020. On
December 15, 2020, the court ordered the action stayed as to Lion.
On August 25, 2023, Plaintiff filed an “Amendment to
Complaint,” wherein Tan Sri Cheng Young Kim (aka Albert Cheng) was named in
lieu of Doe 1.
On September 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed another “Amendment to
Complaint,” wherein Cheng Yong Kim (aka Albert Cheng) was named in lieu of Doe
2.
On November 29, 2023, Plaintiff dismissed Tan Sri Cheng
Young Kim (aka Albert Cheng) and Cheng Yong Kim (aka Albert Cheng), with
prejudice.
A Status Conference
Re: Bankruptcy is set for April 10, 2024.
Legal Standard
“The court
may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow a
party to amend any pleading…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (a)(1); and see §
576 [“Any judge, at any time before or after commencement of trial, in the
furtherance of justice, and upon such terms as may be proper, may allow the
amendment of any pleading or pretrial conference order”].)
“[T]he trial
court has wide discretion in allowing the amendment of any pleading.” (Bedolla v. Logan & Frazer (1975) 52
Cal.App.3d 118, 135.) “[I]t is irrelevant that new legal theories are
introduced as long as the proposed amendments relate to the same general set of
facts.” (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior
Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048 [quotation marks and citation
omitted].) “[E]ven if the proposed legal theory is a novel one, the preferable
practice would be to permit the amendment and allow the parties to test its legal sufficiency by demurrer, motion for judgment on the
pleadings or other appropriate proceedings.” (Id. [quotation marks and citation omitted].) With that said, “the
failure of a proposed amendment to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action or defense may support an order denying a motion to amend.” (California
Casualty Gen. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 274, 280,
disapproved of on other grounds in Kransco v. American Empire Surplus Lines
Ins. Co. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 390)
Courts must
apply a policy of great liberality in permitting amendments to the complaint at
any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial, when no prejudice is
shown to the adverse party. (Atkinson v.
Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.) However, “even if a good
amendment is proposed in proper form, unwarranted delay in presenting it may—of
itself—be a valid reason for denial. . . denial may rest upon the element of
lack of diligence in offering the
amendment
after knowledge of the facts, or the effect of the delay on the adverse party.”
(Roemer v. Retail Credit Co.
(1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 926, 940.)
Also, “[a] motion to amend a pleading before trial must: (1)
Include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be
serially numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments;
(2) State what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted,
if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the deleted allegations
are located; and (3) State what allegations are proposed to be added to the
previous pleading, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the
additional allegations are located.” (Cal. Rules of Court (“CRC”), rule 3.1324,
subd. (a).)
Additionally, “[a] separate declaration must accompany the
motion and must specify: (1) The effect of the amendment; (2) Why the amendment
is necessary and proper; (3) When the facts giving rise to the amended
allegations were discovered; and (4) The reasons why the request for amendment
was not made earlier.” (CRC Rule 3.1324, subd. (b).)
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the court
for an order granting it leave to file its proposed Fourth Amended Complaint
(“4AC”).
Plaintiff represents that
the 4AC “primarily seeks: (1) recognition that the English Action II
has been reduced to Judgment; (2) to add a cause of action against defendant
Likom USA for Actually Fraudulent Transfers under California’s Uniform
Fraudulent Transfer Act (“UFTA”); and (3) to add an alternative cause of action
against defendant Likom USA for Constructively Fraudulent Transfers under the
UFTA.” (Motion, 2:11-15). Plaintiff also seeks to have the alter ego
allegations in the former third cause of action moved into the second cause of
action. (See Hansen Decl., ¶ 6(B).) The second cause of action is now also
directed against Likom USA. (Id.)
Plaintiff has attached a redline copy
reflecting the changes between the operative TAC and proposed 4AC. (Hansen
Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. B). Plaintiff has also attached as Addendum I to the motion a
listing or proposed deletions from, and proposed additions to, the proposed
4AC. The court determines that Exhibit B and Addendum I constitutes compliance
with CRC Rule 3.1324, subdivision (a).
Plaintiff’s counsel has provided the court
and opposing counsel with a declaration that sufficiently complies with CRC
Rule 3.1324, subdivision (b).
Likom USA, in opposition, contends that the proposed
third and fourth causes of action are time-barred. The statute of limitations
on a fraudulent transfer claim is governed by Civil Code § 3439.09 which reads,
in relevant part, as follows:
A cause of action
with respect to a transfer or obligation under this chapter 
is extinguished
unless action is brought . . .:
 
(a)              
Under
paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 3439.04[1], not
later than 
four years after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred or,
if 
later, not later than one year after the
transfer or obligation was or could 
reasonably have been discovered by the
claimant.
(b)              
Under
paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 3439.04[2] or
Section 
3439.05[3], not
later than four years after the transfer was made or the 
obligation was incurred.
 
Likom USA argues that the statute of
limitations on the proposed third and fourth causes of action ran, at the
latest, by December 3, 2022 (i.e., four years from December 3, 2018, which
Plaintiff alleges was the closing date of the sale of Likom USA’s ownership
interest in Likom Mexico’s shares, inventory and equipment; See proposed 4AC, ¶
44). It argues that Plaintiff knew of the alleged transfer prior to the May 21,
2019 conference and received discovery relating to the sale of Likom Mexico on
or about September 28, 2021. (Sparkman Decl., ¶¶ 2 and 3).
Plaintiff, in turn, cites to Cortez v.
Vogt (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 917, 920, which held that “where an alleged
fraudulent transfer occurs while an action seeking to establish the underlying
liability is pending, and where a judgment establishing the liability later
becomes final, . . . the four-year limitation period, i.e., the language, ‘four
years after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred[]’  [is construed] to accommodate a tolling until
the underlying liability becomes fixed by a final judgment.” Likom USA argues
that Plaintiff “was already a judgment creditor of Defendant Lion” on December
3, 2018, that “[t]he entire premise of the present action is Plaintiff’s
allegations that LIKOM is LION’s property pursuant to a theory of alter -ego
and/or the integrated single entity theory and that, as such, Plaintiff should
not be permitted to rely on Cortez to extend the statute of limitations.
(Opp., 5:23-26).
Plaintiff, in
turn, asserts that it did not become a judgment creditor as to the claims of English
Action II (which was instituted on May 30, 2018) until March 11, 2020
(Houghton Decl., ¶¶ 3 and 4) and that, as such, the statute of limitations will
not run until March 11, 2024 as to the “completely separate” claims of English
Action II. Plaintiff’s counsel concedes that “while writing the Reply to
the 1st Motion to Leave to File FAC it was realized under the Third
and Fourth Causes of Action for fraudulent transfers that the English Action
I Judgment would not support those Causes of Action because it was time
barred.” (Hansen Decl., ¶ 9(B) [Bold added].)
The court believes
that the proposed third and fourth causes of action are time-barred. (See Cortez,
supra, 52 Cal.App.4th at 937 [“In cases. . . where there is an alleged
fraudulent transfer made during a pending lawsuit that will establish
whether in fact, and the extent to which, a debtor-creditor relationship exists,
we conclude the limitation period does not commence to run until the judgment
in the underlying action becomes final”].) A debtor-creditor relationship was
established, at the latest, when English Action I became final.
The court
declines to address the relation back doctrine as to the aforesaid proposed
fraudulent transfer causes of action, inasmuch as it was not raised by
Plaintiff.
Likom USA does
not appear to oppose any of the other amendments in Plaintiff’s proposed 4AC;
as such, the court will deny the motion in part (i.e., as to Plaintiff’s
request to add a third cause of action for Actually Fraudulent Transfers and a
fourth cause of action for Constructively Fraudulent Transfers) and otherwise
grant the motion.
Plaintiff’s
counsel is instructed to file and serve a revised version of the proposed 4AC,
omitting the third cause of action for Actually Fraudulent Transfers and fourth
cause of action for Constructively Fraudulent Transfers within 10 days from the
date of the hearing of the motion.
