And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants in part and denies in part Plaintiff Classic Maritime, Inc.'s motion for leave to file a fourth amended verified complaint. The motion is granted in part as to the addition of new allegations and the rewriting of existing allegations, but denied in part as to the addition of new causes of action for Actually Fraudulent Transfers and Constructively Fraudulent Transfers. The judge finds that these new causes of action are time-barred and that the statute of limitations on fraudulent transfer claims is governed by Civil Code § 3439.09. The judge also declines to address the relation back doctrine as it was not raised by the plaintiff. The judge instructs the plaintiff's counsel to file and serve a revised version of the proposed fourth amended complaint, omitting the time-barred causes of action, within 10 days from the date of the hearing.
