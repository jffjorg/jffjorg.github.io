And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to consolidate two cases, BC700926 and 23PSCV02834, for all purposes. The motion was filed on October 5, 2023, but failed to comply with California Rules of Court Rule 3.350, which requires a notice of motion to consolidate to list all named parties, contain the captions of all cases sought to be consolidated, and be filed in each case. The court notes that the plaintiff's counsel is admonished in this regard. The court also denies the plaintiff's request for consolidation, citing the fact that the court has already entered an Interlocutory Judgment in Case #2 on December 27, 2023, which states that Bread Factory's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is sustained and no trial of other issues shall be had until the final determination in Case No. BC700926.
