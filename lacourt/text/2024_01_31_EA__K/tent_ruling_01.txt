Legal Standard
“When actions involving a common question of law or fact are
pending before the court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all
the matters in issue in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated
and it may make such orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid
unnecessary costs or delay.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd. (a).)
“There are two types of consolidation: a complete consolidation
resulting in a single action, and a consolidation
of separate actions for trial. Under the former procedure, which may be
utilized where the parties are identical and the causes could have been joined,
the pleadings are regarded as merged, one set of findings is made, and one
judgment is rendered. In a consolidation
for trial, the pleadings, verdicts, findings and judgments are kept separate;
the actions are simply tried together for the sake of convenience and judicial
economy.” (Sanchez v. Superior Court
(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1391, 1396 [citation omitted].)
“A notice of motion to consolidate must: (A) List all named parties in
each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names of their
respective attorneys of record; (B) Contain the captions of all the cases
sought to be consolidated, with the lowest numbered case shown first; and (C)
Be filed in each case sought to be consolidated.” (Cal. Rules of Court [“CRC”]
Rule 3.350(a)(1).) “The motion to consolidate: (A) Is deemed a single motion
for the purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but memorandums,
declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in the lowest
numbered case; (B) Must be served on all attorneys of record and all
nonrepresented parties in all of the cases sought to be consolidated; and (C)
Must have a proof of service filed as part of the motion.” (CRC Rule 3.350(b).)
Discussion
Plaintiff moves the court for an order consolidating this instant action (i.e., “Case #1”) with case styled
Rideau v. Smart & Final LLC, et al., Case No. 23PSCV02834 (i.e., Case
#2”) for all purposes.
Procedural Deficiencies
At the outset, the court notes
that Plaintiff’s motion fails to comply with CRC Rule 3.350, subdivision (a)
(i.e., “[a] notice of motion to consolidate must: (A) List all named parties in
each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names of their
respective attorneys of record; (B) Contain the captions of all the cases
sought to be consolidated, with the lowest numbered case shown first; and (C)
 Be filed in each case sought to be consolidated”). Plaintiff’s counsel is
admonished in this regard.
Merits
Plaintiff’s request for consolidation is denied. The motion
was filed on October 5, 2023. The court subsequently entered an Interlocutory
Judgment in Case #2 on December 27, 2023, which expressly states that “Bread
Factory's Demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint made pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 430.10 is SUSTAINED. An Interlocutory Judgment shall be
entered in favor of Bread Factory and no trial of other issues shall be had
until the final determination in Case No. BC700926.” (Emphasis added).
