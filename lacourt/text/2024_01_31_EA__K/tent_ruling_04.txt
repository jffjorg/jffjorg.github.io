Discussion
Plaintiff moves the
court, per Civil Code § 8800, for an award of attorney’s fees in the amount of $102,231.75.
The motion originally came on calendar for hearing on
October 31, 2023. The court posted a tentative ruling prior to the hearing,
advising therein that “Defendants assert that Plaintiff is not, in fact,
entitled to recovery of fees pursuant to Civil Code § 8800, subdivision (c) on
the basis that there is no progress payment contract in this case. The court
needs additional briefing on this matter to make that determination” and
that “[t]o the extent Plaintiff seeks attorneys’ fees under Civil Code § 8800, the
court seeks further briefing how the various invoices introduced as trial
exhibits comply with the provisions of section 8800.” (Bold in original;
italics added). The court’s tentative ruling indicated that the hearing on the
motion would be continued to January 26, 2024.
The court’s October 31, 2023 minute order reflects that
Plaintiff’s counsel did not make an appearance on that date. The court clerk
provided notice to both counsel of the new January 26, 2024 hearing date. On
December 13, 2023, a “Notice Re: Continuance of Hearing and Order” was filed,
wherein the court rescheduled the hearing to January 31, 2024; again, both
counsel were provided notice by the court clerk. On December 20, 2023,
Plaintiff filed (and email-served) a “Notice of Continuance of Motion for Attorneys’
Fees,” advising therein of the new January 31, 2024 hearing date.
The court has not received any additional briefing from the
parties, to date (i.e., as of January 24, 2024 at 9:35 a.m.).
The court, then, will deny the motion, on the basis that
Plaintiff has failed to show an entitlement to fees pursuant to Civil Code §
8800.
