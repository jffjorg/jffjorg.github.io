RULING:
 
With respect to defendants National Transportation Inc.,
John Eldon Kindt, and Jim Gleich, the UNOPPOSED Applications for Writ of
Possession by plaintiff Ally Bank Lease Trust are DENIED. Under CCP § 512.030,
prior to the hearing on an application for a writ of possession, the defendant
“shall be served” with specific documents, including the Summons and Complaint,
the Notice of Application and Hearing, and a copy of the application and any
affidavits. Plaintiff has neither filed any proofs of service of the foregoing
with the Court nor attached proofs of service to the filed documents. Because
plaintiff has failed to provide proof of service on defendants as required, the
applications cannot be granted.
