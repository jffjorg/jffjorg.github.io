```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling is based on the administrative per se law, which requires the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to immediately suspend the driver's license of a person who is driving with a blood-alcohol concentration of .08% or more. The petitioner does not challenge the findings that led to the suspension, including the reasonable cause that the petitioner drove under the influence of alcohol, the lawful arrest, and the notice of consequences for failure to submit to a chemical test. The judge is taking judicial notice of the California Supreme Court's orders in Case No. S274860. The ruling follows the Court of Appeal's prior opinion in California DUI Lawyers Assn. v. Department of Motor Vehicles (2022).
