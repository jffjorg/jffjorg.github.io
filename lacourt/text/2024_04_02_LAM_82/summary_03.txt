And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the unopposed application for a writ of possession by plaintiff Ally Bank. The application was denied because the plaintiff failed to provide proof of service on the defendants as required by California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) ยง 512.030. The code requires that defendants be served with specific documents, including the Summons and Complaint, Notice of Application and Hearing, and a copy of the application and any affidavits. The plaintiff has not filed any proofs of service with the court or attached them to the filed documents. Therefore, the judge has denied the application for a writ of possession.
