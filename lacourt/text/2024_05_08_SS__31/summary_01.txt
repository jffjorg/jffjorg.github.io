```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling grants the motion to set aside the dismissal of the action. The plaintiff's counsel made a calendaring error, which caused the dismissal of the action. The court finds that the plaintiff's counsel's affidavit of mistake due to a mistake in writing the correct hearing date is sufficient to set aside the dismissal. The motion is granted and the action is reinstated. The moving party is ordered to give notice.
