And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling is about a motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena for production of business records. The defendant seeks to compel the VA Long Beach Healthcare System to produce medical records of the plaintiff, who received treatment at VA Long Beach for injuries from a motor vehicle incident. The defendant initially filed the motion, but it was denied without prejudice because the defendant failed to personally serve the non-party VA Long Beach. The defendant re-filed the motion and provided proof of personal service, but the timing of the service is at issue. The court finds that the defendant's motion fails to provide proper statutory notice, as required by CCP §1005, and continues the hearing. The defendant must provide VA Long Beach with proper notice of the continued hearing date.
