Here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has granted Defendants' motion to file a First Amended Answer (FAA) including a tenth affirmative defense of workers' compensation exclusive remedy. The Court disagrees with Plaintiff that the affirmative defense would unnecessarily expand the scope of this litigation. The Court finds that the facts of the case suggest a possibility that the injuries arose out of an employment relationship, making it possible for Defendants to raise the workers' compensation exclusive remedy defense. The Court also finds that Plaintiff has not identified any actual prejudice from the amendment. The Court grants the motion to file the FAA and orders Defendants to file a separate copy of the proposed FAA within ten days of the date of this Order.
