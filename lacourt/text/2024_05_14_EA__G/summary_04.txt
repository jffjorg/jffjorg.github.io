```
Case Number: KC069072
Hearing Date: May 14, 2024
Dept: G
Defendant/Cross-Complainant: West Hills Construction, Inc.
Respondents: Plaintiffs McKinley Home Foundation and McKinley Children’s Center, Inc.

Tentative Ruling: West Hills’ Motion to Bifurcate Issues of Warranty and Order for Court Trial is GRANTED.

Background:

  * Plaintiffs McKinley Home Foundation and McKinley Children’s Center, Inc. (collectively McKinley) entered into an agreement with Defendant West Hills Construction, Inc. (West Hills) in June 2011.
  * West Hills agreed to install a solar power system manufactured and supplied by Green Volts, Inc. (Green Volts) in exchange for payment of $2,481,088.21.
  * In April 2015, a large number of components failed leading to the complete failure of the system.
  * McKinley filed an operative First Amended Complaint against West Hills and Does 1-30, alleging causes of action for (1) breach of warranty, (2) breach of contract, and (3) breach of contract - third party beneficiary.
  * West Hills filed a cross-complaint against Green Volts and Roes 1-20 for (1) equitable indemnity, (2) declaratory relief, (3) contribution, and (4) express indemnity.
  * On December 22, 2020, the Court of Appeal issued a decision that reversed the Court’s grant of summary judgment.

Analysis:

  * Code of Civil Procedure section 598 establishes the following procedure for bifurcation of issues at trial: “The court may, when the convenience of witnesses, the ends of justice, or the economy and efficiency of handling the litigation would be promoted thereby, on motion of a party, after notice and hearing, make an order, no later than the close of pretrial conference in cases in which such pretrial conference is to be held, or, in other cases, no later than 30 days before the trial date, that the trial of any issue or any part thereof shall precede the trial of any other issue or any part thereof in the case, except for special defenses which may be tried first pursuant to Sections 597 and 597.5.”

Discussion:

  * West Hills argues the Court should bifurcate trial of McKinley’s claims and first determine whether the warranty provisions at issue imposed a duty on West Hills.
  * McKinley argues this is merely an attempt to short-circuit McKinley’s right to a jury trial as there are multiple issues of fact with regards to West Hills’ alleged warranty obligations.
  * The Court of Appeal held the warranty contract between McKinley and West Hills is facially ambiguous as a matter of law.
  * West Hills argues Green Volts’ warranty and an email discussion between McKinley and West Hills suggest the solar panels were covered by Green Volts’ warranty.
  * McKinley points to their own evidence which they argue establishes West Hills’ actions prior to the dispute were consistent with McKinley’s interpretation of the warranty contract including West Hills undertaking repairs of the solar panel components without cost.

Intentions:

  * West Hills’ motion to bifurcate is GRANTED.
