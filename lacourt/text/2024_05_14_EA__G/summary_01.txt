And here is the summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has denied Mt. San Antonio Community College District's motion for recovery of attorney's fees as part of allowable costs and for failure to prosecute in good faith. The court found that the motion was not frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless, and that the plaintiff's action was not rendered frivolous by the plaintiff's failure to succeed on the merits. The court also found that the plaintiff made reasonable, albeit unsuccessful, arguments to explain why the arbitration decision did not have issue preclusive effect on the plaintiff's FEHA claim.
