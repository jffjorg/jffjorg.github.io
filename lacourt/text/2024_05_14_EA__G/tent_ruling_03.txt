for Default Judgment
Respondent: NO OPPOSITION
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff U.S. Bank National Association’s Application
for Default Judgment is GRANTED.
BACKGROUND
This
is a breach of contract action arising from an equipment finance agreement. In
February 2023, Plaintiff U.S. Bank National Association (U.S. Bank) entered
into a written equipment finance agreement with Defendant Koky, Inc. (Koky) in
which U.S. Bank agreed to provide financing for Koky’s purchase of two
semi-trucks. In support of the agreement, Defendant Jorge Chavez Avalos
executed a personal guaranty. Starting in May 2023, U.S. Bank alleges Koky and
Chavez Avalos breached the agreement by failing to make the required monthly
payments.
On September
14, 2023, U.S. Bank filed a complaint against Koky, Chavez Avalos, and Does
1-100, alleging the following causes of action: (1) breach of written
agreement, (2) breach of personal guaranty, (3) account stated, (4)
indebtedness, (5) unjust enrichment, (6) claim and delivery, and (7)
conversion. On
October 2, 2023, U.S. Bank’s process server served Koky and Chavez Avalos with
substitute service in Hesperia.
On December
7, 2023, the Court entered default against Koky and Chavez Avalos after they
filed to timely file an answer. On April 12, 2024, U.S. Bank submitted the present
application for default judgment.
An
OSC Re: Default Judgment is set for May 14, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
Code
of Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a
party has filed to timely respond or appear.  A party seeking judgment on
the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment, and: (1) a
brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in
support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4)
a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of judgment; (6) a
dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application
for separate judgment under CCP § 579, supported by a showing of grounds for
each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees
if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of
Court 3.1800.)
ANALYSIS
U.S.
Bank seeks default judgment against Koky and Chavez Avalos in the total amount
of $120,660.01, including $105,931.44 in damages, $11,005.26 in interest, $2,949.31
in attorney fees, and $774.00 in costs. Because the Court finds U.S. Bank has
submitted sufficient evidence, the Court GRANTS U.S. Bank’s application
for default judgment.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, U.S. Bank’s application for default
judgment is GRANTED.
