And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants U.S. Bank's application for default judgment against Koky, Inc. and Jorge Chavez Avalos. The case arises from a breach of contract action arising from an equipment finance agreement. U.S. Bank and Koky entered into an agreement in which U.S. Bank agreed to provide financing for Koky's purchase of two semi-trucks. Defendant Jorge Chavez Avalos executed a personal guaranty. Starting in May 2023, U.S. Bank alleges that Koky and Chavez Avalos failed to make required monthly payments. The Court finds that U.S. Bank has submitted sufficient evidence to support its application for default judgment. The total amount sought is $120,660.01, including damages, interest, attorney fees, and costs.
