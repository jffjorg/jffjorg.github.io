And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

"The motion filed by plaintiff Emad Qubrosi to set aside the dismissal of his action is granted. The court finds that Qubrosi's counsel, Nicholas Dagher, failed to appear for a case management conference due to a calendaring error, which was not discovered until April 2, 2024. As a result, the court grants Qubrosi's motion and vacates the dismissal of his action. A hearing on the motion is set for May 14, 2024."
