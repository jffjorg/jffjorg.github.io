Plaintiff alleges that it entered into a ten-year lease with Defendant Kreation Juicery, Inc. and Defendant failed to pay rent.DISCUSSIONArash Sadat and Camron Dowlatshahi, Counsel for Defendant Kreation Juicery, Inc., move to be relieved as counsel.“The question of granting or denying an application of an attorney to withdraw as counsel (Code Civ. Proc., § 284, subd. (2)) is one which lies within the sound discretion of the trial court ‘having in mind whether such withdrawal might work an injustice in the handling of the case.’  [Citation.]”  (People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406 [internal quotations omitted].)  The court should consider whether the attorney’s “withdrawal can be accomplished without undue prejudice to the client’s interests.”  (Ramirez v. Sturdivant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 requires that the following be submitted in support of an attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel pursuant Code of Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision (2): (1) a notice of motion and motion directed to the client (made on Notice of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil (Judicial Council Form, MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision (2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284, subdivision (1) (made on Declaration in Support of Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil (Judicial Council Form, MC-052)); (3) a proof of service evidencing service of the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order on the client and on all other parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) a proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil (Judicial Council Form, MC-053)).  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (a), (c), (d), (e).)Counsel filed a Notice of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel (MC-051), an Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel (MC-053), and a Declaration in Support of Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel (MC-052) on the appropriate forms, as outlined within California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subdivisions (a), (c), and (e). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (a), (c), (e).) Counsel represents they served Defendant at its last known address which they confirmed was current via telephone at least 30 days before this motion was filed. (MC-052, Item 3.) The next hearing in this matter is a final status conference set for June 17, 2024 and a non-jury trial set for July 1, 2024. (MC-052, Items 5, 6.) An attorney’s right to withdraw is conditioned on proper notice and a showing of why a court order is required. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.) An attorney for a corporation must seek Court approval to withdraw. (Laskowitz v. Shellenberger (1952) 107 F.Supp. 397, 398.) Although a corporation cannot act in propria personal in a California state court, an attorney may still withdraw without offending this rule given proper grounds. (Thomas G. Ferruzzo, Inc. v. Superior Court (1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 501, 504.) For example, where a corporate client is not cooperating with its counsel and refuses to consent to a substitution of counsel, the attorney representing the corporate client has proper grounds to seek court approval to withdraw. (Id.)Here, Counsel merely state they are making this motion instead of filing a consent under Code Civ. Proc., § 284(1) because Defendant is a business entity. Although Counsel must seek court approval to withdraw, the Court must also determine  whether proper grounds exist for the withdrawal. Counsel do not state whether another attorney will substitute in or what grounds exist to justify the withdrawal. The Court cannot determine whether withdrawal is proper without this information.DATED: April 30, 2024 ________________________Hon. Jill Feeney Judge of the Superior Court
