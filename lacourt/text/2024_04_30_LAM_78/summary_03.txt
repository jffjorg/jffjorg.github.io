And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge denies the motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Kreation Juicery, Inc. filed by Arash Sadat and Camron Dowlatshahi. The Court cannot determine whether the withdrawal is proper without more information from the counsel. Although counsel must seek court approval to withdraw, the Court must also determine whether proper grounds exist for the withdrawal.
