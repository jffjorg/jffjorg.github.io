  Case Number:  23STCV18463    Hearing Date:   March 21, 2024    Dept:  57 Solis Demurrer Seventh Cause of Action: Intentional Infliction of Emotional DistressThe Court rejects Solis's argument that the Workers' Compensation Act provides the exclusive remedy for Plaintiff's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.  That Act does not apply to claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress in the employment context where the allegedly actionable conduct also forms the basis for an alleged of the Fair Employment and Housing Act.  (M.F. v. Pacific Pearl Hotel Management LLC (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 693, 700.)   The Court is nevertheless sustaining Solis's demurrer to Plaintiff's cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress with leave to amend because Solis correctly argues that the allegations in Plaintiff's fail to establish conduct so outrageous and distress so severe to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distressEighth Cause of Action:  AssaultThe Court is sustaining Solis's demurrer to the cause of action for assault with leave to amend because the allegations in Plaintiff's complaint fail to establish willful assault,  which is necessary to avoid preemption of workplace assaults under the Workers'  Compensation Act.Ninth Cause of Action: False Imprisonment The Court is sustaining Solis's demurrer to the cause of action for false imprisonment with leave to amend because Plaintiff's complaint fails to allege the necessary element of intentional confinement.REGENTS' MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGSFirst Cause of Action: Whistleblower RetaliationThe motion is sustained with leave to amend as to the cause of action for whistleblower retaliation because Plaintiff has failed to allege that she exhausted the necessary administrative remedies or that exhaustion was excused.Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Causes of ActionThe motion is sustained as to these causes of action with leave to amend for two reasons.  First, the Regents are immune from vicarious liability arising out of the actions of their employee, Solis.   Plaintiff does not address this argument in her opposition to the Regents' motion.  Second, even if the Regents are not immune, they cannot be held vicariously liable for Solis's action because, as set forth above in connection with the ruling on Solis's demurrer, Plaintiff has failed to establish that Solis himself is liable on these causes of action.
