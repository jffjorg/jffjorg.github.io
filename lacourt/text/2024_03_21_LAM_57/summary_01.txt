And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer motions filed by Solis and the Regents. The judge rejects Solis's argument that the Workers' Compensation Act provides the exclusive remedy for the Plaintiff's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. However, the judge sustains Solis's demurrer to the Plaintiff's cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress with leave to amend, finding that the allegations fail to establish conduct so outrageous and distress so severe to state a claim.

The judge also sustains the Regents' motion for judgment on the pleadings with leave to amend as to the Plaintiff's causes of action for whistleblower retaliation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, assault, and false imprisonment. The judge finds that the Plaintiff has failed to exhaust the necessary administrative remedies or that exhaustion was excused, and that the Regents are immune from vicarious liability arising out of the actions of their employee, Solis.
