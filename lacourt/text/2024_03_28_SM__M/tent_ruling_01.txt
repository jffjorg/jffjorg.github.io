LLC v. 1055 Shadow Hill LLC, et al.
CASE NO.:                22SMCV00854

to Compel the Deposition of Kimora Lee Simmons and the PMK of Plaintiff Royal
Lee LLC
HEARING DATE:   3/28/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
Service of a proper deposition
notice obligates a party or “party-affiliated” witness (officer, director,
managing agent or employee of party) to attend and testify, as well as produce
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing for
inspection and copying. (CCP § 2025.280(a).) If, after service of a deposition
notice, a party deponent fails to appear, testify, or produce documents or
tangible things for inspection without having served a valid objection under
CCP § 2025.410, the deposing party may move for an order compelling attendance,
testimony, and production. (CCP § 2025.450(a).) The motion must be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration, or, when a party deponent fails to attend the
deposition, the motion must also be accompanied by a declaration stating that
the moving party has contacted the party deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance. (CCP § 2025.450(b)(2).) 
 
A motion to compel production
of documents described in a deposition notice must be accompanied by a showing
of good cause. (CCP § 2025.450(b)(1).) In other words, the moving party must
provide evidence (generally in the form of declarations) showing specific facts
justifying inspection of the documents described in the notice. Courts
liberally construe good cause in favor of discovery where facts show the
documents are necessary for trial preparation.
 
The motion to compel must be
“made no later than 60 days after the completion of the record of the
deposition.” (CCP § 2025.480(b).) This time limit also applies to motions based
on a deposition subpoena for production of documents or a business records subpoena.
The 60-day time limit runs from the date objections are served because the
deposition record is then complete. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co.
(2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1192.) 
 
 
EVIDENTIARY ISSUES
 
Plaintiffs’ objections are OVERRULED.
 
 
Analysis
 
Defendants 1055 Shadow Hill LLC and
Steve B. Mikhov moves to compel the deposition of Cross-Defendant Kimora Lee
Simmons and the Person Most Knowledgeable (PMK) of Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Royal
Lee LLC. Defendants also move sanctions against Plaintiffs and their attorneys
of record pay the moving party the sum of $10,565.00.
 
On March 17, 2023, Defendants
noticed the depositions of Kimora Lee Simmons and the Royal Lee LLC’s PMK,
setting the dates for May 8, 2023 and May 9, 2023. (Browning Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. 1.)
Simmons and Royal Lee claimed they were unavailable for those dates. Following
meet and confer efforts, Defendants served First Amended Notices of
Depositions, setting the depositions for June 28, 2023, and June 29, 2023.
(Browning Decl. ¶5, Ex. 5.) Plaintiffs objected to the notice on June 23, 2023.
(Id., ¶ 5, Ex. 6.) Following a meet and confer letter, Plaintiffs advised Defendants
on June 27, 2023, that they would be out of town for “most (if not all) of the
next few months” and provided dates three months out. (Id. ¶7; Ex. 8.) Over the
next few months, the parties met and conferred to no avail. (Id., ¶¶ 8-11.) On December
28, 2023, Defendants advised Plaintiffs that they would select a date for the
depositions and notice the depositions. (Id., ¶12, Ex. 10.) Plaintiffs did not
respond. (Id.) 
 
On January 9, 2024, counsel for
Defendants served Second Amended Notices of Deposition. (Id. ¶13; Ex. 11.) On
January 25, 2024, counsel for Plaintiff served objections to the Second Amended
Notices of Deposition, claiming that “the currently scheduled deposition dates
of February 1 and February 6 don’t work for our clients, but we are working
with them to find dates of availability in late February.” (Id., Ex. 12.) On
January 26, 2024, Defendants advised that they planned on moving forward with
the depositions unless firm dates were provided by Plaintiffs by the end of the
day. On January 28, 2024, Simmons and Royal Lee advised Defendants that they
were available February 28 and February 29, 2024. (Id. ¶15.) On January 30,
2024, Defendants served Third Amended Notices of Deposition with the provided
dates. (Id. ¶15; Ex. 14.) The deposition notices requested that the deponents
produce thirty-one (31) categories of documents at their deposition. (Ex. 14,
Ex. A.)
 
On February 21, 2024, Simmons and
Royal Lee served objections to the deposition notices and insisted that the
depositions proceed remotely because the deponents “would have to drive from
the hills in Beverly Hills [to Torrance] through rush hour traffic. That is a
risky proposition in LA and there is no guaranty that they will make it there
in a timely fashion.” (Id. ¶16, Ex. 15.) Defendants insisted on in-person
depositions. (Id., ¶ 17.) On February 22, 2024, Plaintiffs stated that they
“are not opposed to in person depositions” but requested that the depositions
take place in Plaintiffs’ counsel’s offices instead for the “convenience” of
the deponents. (Id. ¶18, Ex. 15.) Defendants advised Plaintiffs that the
depositions would take place at their noticed location. (Id.) On February 23,
2024, counsel for Plaintiffs claimed that the deponents were now “out of town”
and would be unable to participate in person for their scheduled depositions on
February 28 and 29, 2024, despite the fact that they had selected and provided the
dates of February 28 and 29 as available dates after months of delays in
providing dates. (¶19, Exs. 15.) On February 27, 2024, one day before the first
scheduled deposition, Plaintiffs unilaterally cancelled the in-person
depositions via e-mail, claiming that “we have informed our clients that the
depositions are no longer going forward this week.” (Id. ¶20, Ex. 15.)  Defendants conducted the in-person
depositions as noticed on February 28 and 29, 2024. (Id. ¶20, Ex. 16 & 17.)
Simmons, Royal Lee’s PMK, and their counsel did not appear at their depositions.
(Id.) 
 
Defendants establish that they
served valid deposition notices on Simmons and Royal Lee, and that RP failed to
appear as noticed. The objections to the notice are not valid objections under Code
of Civil Procedure section 2025.410. Thus, the depositions should have gone
forward as noticed.
 
Simmons and Royal Lee insist that
they were compliant with the deposition notices by being available for remote
depositions, but fail to justify their refusal to attend the depositions as
noticed. They further argue that the notice was confusing, and they believed
that the deposition was to be conducted remotely. (Simmons Decl., ¶ 2, Yemini
Decl., ¶ 2.) However, there was nothing confusing about the notice, as they
clearly state that the deposition was to be “conducted in person at Kendall
Law, a Professional Law Corporation located at 1230 Crenshaw Blvd, Suite 101,
Torrance, CA 90501.” The fact that Defendants reserved the right to use certain
technologies would not contradict the clear instructions that the deposition
was to be conducted in person at a specific time and place. Simmons and Royal
Lee’s purported confusion about the requirements of the deposition should have
been clarified by counsel. Further, their counsel objected to this notice on
February 22, 2024, asserting that it would be inconvenient for Simmons and
Royal Lee to drive from Beverly Hills to Torrance. (Ex. 15.) Counsel then
conceded that they were “not opposed to in-person depositions” but requested
that the depositions take place in Century City. (Id.) Counsel clearly
understood that the notice was for an in-person deposition. In addition, counsel
should have explained to Simmons and Royal Lee’s PMK the legal effect of the
deposition notices so that they did not leave the state on those dates. 
 
Simmons and Royal Lee fail to show
good cause for the Court to order remote depositions, or an alternative
location for the depositions. They raise for the first time that they have
ailments which prevent them from attending in-person depositions in Torrance. Yemini
claims that he had “several back surgeries and have severe back problems [and]
cannot sit [f]or extended periods of time without severe back pain and need to
stand, walk or lie prone to avoid or alleviate that pain.” (Yemini Decl., ¶ 5.)
Simmons claims that she has “recently been sick with the COVID-19 virus,” that
she has been avoiding “lengthy in person meetings with people outside my family
in closed environments,” and that she is concerned about “health risks” posed
by those attending the deposition. (Simmons Decl., ¶3.) The Court does not find
these conclusory excuses sufficient to avoid the in-person depositions at the
noticed location. The record also contradicts these excuses. Simmons claims
that he cannot travel for prolonged periods of time yet travels to and from New
York on business several times a year. (Yemini Decl., ¶ 4.) Yemini’s ability to
handle 5-6 hour flights multiple times a year would undercut his assertion that
an hour long drive to Torrance is unmanageable. 
Simmons broadly cites COVID-19 and concerns over unspecified health
risks posed by the deposition, yet she has recently posted pictures of herself
attending a crowded professional basketball game. (See Rep., at fn. 11.) Thus,
the Court sees no persuasive reason to modify the location of the deposition. 
 
Accordingly, the motion to compel
is GRANTED. Simmons and Yemini (or another PMK for Royal Lee) must attend their
respective depositions within 20 days at the noticed location – Kendall Law, a
Professional Law Corporation, 1230 Crenshaw Blvd, Suite 101, Torrance, CA 90501.
The parties are ordered to meet and confer on scheduling the depositions at
mutually agreeable times and dates.
 
Defendants request sanctions in the
amount of $10,565.00, for 21.9 hours of time at varying rates and costs of $1,880.00.
(Browning Decl., ¶¶ 22-23.) Reviewing the totality of the record, the Court
finds that a reasonable fee in this instance would be $6,280.00, inclusive of
costs. Sanctions are therefore imposed in the reduced total amount of
$6,280.00, inclusive of costs, against Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Royal Lee LLC,
Cross-Defendant Kimora Simmons and their counsel of record Barnes &
Thornburg LLP, jointly and severally. Sanctions are to be paid within 30 days.
