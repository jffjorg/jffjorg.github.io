  Case Number:  20STCV45280    Hearing Date:   December 23, 2024    Dept:  34 Plaintiff Juan Carlos Morales II’s Motion to Strike Notice
of Lien is GRANTED.  
 
Background
On November 25, 2020,
Plaintiff Juan Carlos Morales II (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against
Defendants Honey Science Corporation and PayPal, Inc. (“Defendants”) arising
from Plaintiff’s employment with Defendants alleging causes of action for:
1.    
      Recission
of Contract; and 
2.    
      Declaratory
Relief. 
On January 27, 2021, the court
found related cases 20STCV11118 and 20STCV45280 and designated 20STCV11118 as
the lead case.
On June 4, 2021, the court
ordered this case to arbitration and stayed this case pursuant to the court
granting the same relief in 20STCV11118.
On May 4, 2023, a final
award in this matter was issued following arbitration. 
On June 23, 2023, the court
granted Defendants’ Petition to Confirm Contractual Arbitration Award.
On August 15, 2023, the court
granted in part Defendants’ Motion for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs.
On August 24, 2023, the court
entered its Amended Judgment in this matter.
On August 28, 2023,
Plaintiff filed Judicial Council Form APP-002, Notice of Appeal. 
On November 6, 2024,
Plaintiff filed this Motion to Strike the Notice of Lien filed by Judgment
Creditor in Violation of the Automatic Stay. On December 10, 2024, Defendants
filed a Notice of Non-Opposition to Plaintiff’s motion. On December 12, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a reply. 
Legal Standard
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
436, “the court may, upon a motion made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time
in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper: (a) Strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (b) Strike out
all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws
of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.” The grounds for a
motion to strike must “appear on the face of the challenged pleading or from
any matter of which the court is required to take judicial notice.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437.)
 
Discussion 
 
Request for Judicial Notice 
 
            Plaintiff’s request for judicial
notice is granted. “A court may
properly take judicial notice of its own records. (Evid. Code, § 452, subd.
(e).)” (Garcia v. Sterling (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 17, 21.) Judicial
notice may also be taken of “[f]acts and propositions that are not reasonably
subject to dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate determination by
resort to sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code §§ 452(c),
(h).)
Merits 
 
            Plaintiff
moves for an order striking the Notice of Lien filed in case number 21STCV16653
on December 1, 2023, by Defendants, in violation of the stay present in the
current matter pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 916 following
Plaintiff’s appeal. (Motion, at p. 3, Exh. 2.) 
 
            Defendants
do not oppose Plaintiff’s motion striking their Notice of Lien.
(Non-Opposition, at p. 2.) However, Defendants note that Defendants’ counsel had
previously informed counsel in case number 21STCV16653 that Defendants would
not be enforcing the filed lien due to Plaintiff’s appeal in the current
matter. (Ibid.) As such, Defendants argue Plaintiff’s motion was
unnecessary. (Ibid.)
 
            In
reply, Plaintiff argues that Defendants had not conceded that their Notice of Lien
was improper but merely informally promised not to enforce it. (Sugars Decl., ¶¶
4-9.) 
 
            As
this matter is stayed pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 916(a) and
there are no objections to the granting of Plaintiff’s motion, the court orders
to strike Defendants’ Notice of Lien filed on December 1, 2023.   
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff
Juan Carlos Morales II’s Motion to Strike Notice of Lien is GRANTED.
