And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Plaintiff Juan Carlos Morales II's motion to strike the Notice of Lien filed by Defendants Honey Science Corporation and PayPal, Inc. in violation of the automatic stay. The court has taken judicial notice of its own records and has determined that the Notice of Lien was filed in violation of the stay. The court has also considered the parties' arguments and has noted that while Defendants did not oppose the motion, they did argue that their counsel had previously informed counsel in the related case that they would not be enforcing the filed lien due to Plaintiff's appeal. However, the court has found that Plaintiff's motion was necessary to protect his rights and has ordered the Notice of Lien to be stricken.
