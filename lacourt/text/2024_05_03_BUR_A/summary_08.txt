And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion to hold the default against Alfredo Mendoza and Mendoza Pool & Plaster, Inc. in abeyance. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants' negligence caused leaks in the guest house, and that the defendants failed to install waterproof tile. The court finds that the claims against the appearing defendants (Archstone) and the non-appearing defendants (Mendoza) are inseparable, and that holding the default in abeyance until the claims are fully litigated is appropriate. The court also notes that no party has opposed the motion, and that a failure to oppose a motion may be deemed consent to the granting of the motion.
