  - "A party moving for discovery sanctions based on the intentional destruction of evidence must make an initial prima facie showing that the responding party in fact destroyed evidence that had a substantial probability of damaging the moving party's ability to establish an essential element of his claim or defense." (Williams v. Russ)
  - "The Court finds that Martinez is inapplicable to this case. The issue here is not whether the Plaintiff retained the vehicle, but the Plaintiff disposing of the vehicle knowing that an inspection was pending."
