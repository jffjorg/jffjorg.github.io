And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted Plaintiff's motion to compel further response to Form Interrogatory 2.6. The court finds that Defendant's response to the interrogatory is incomplete because it omits information about his ownership of other gas stations. The court also finds that Defendant's objection to providing further information is without merit. The court awards sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $410, which includes one hour of attorney time at $350 per hour and a filing fee of $60. The court orders Defendant to provide further response to Form Interrogatory 2.6 within 30 days.
