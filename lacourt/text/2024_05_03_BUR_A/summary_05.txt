Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court has considered a motion to compel the attendance of Plaintiff Eileen Figueroa at a deposition. The motion was brought by Kumar & Associates, Inc. and Vijay Kumar (the "Kumar Defendants"). The Plaintiff opposes the motion, claiming that she is not available for deposition until certain documents are produced.

The court has considered the Kumar Defendants' argument that the Plaintiff's objection to the deposition notice is untimely. However, the court declines to consider the objection waived, as it was served electronically within the time period allowed by law.

The court has also considered the Kumar Defendants' failure to meet and confer with the Plaintiff's counsel, as required by law. However, the court does not consider this failure dispositive of the motion.

The court finds that good cause exists to depose the Plaintiff, and grants the motion to compel her attendance at a deposition. The deposition will take place no later than July 31, 2024. The parties are ordered to meet and confer to agree on a deposition date.
