And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge rules that the Defendant's Motion to Strike the Plaintiff's request for punitive damages is GRANTED with 20 days' leave to amend. The Plaintiff's Complaint does not allege facts supporting Defendant's malice, oppression, or fraud, and therefore, the Plaintiff does not have a prima facie claim for punitive damages. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's Complaint is bereft of any facts and therefore, the Defendant's Motion to Strike is granted. The Case Management Conference set for July 1, 2024 remains unchanged.
