And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion from Defendant Reza Safaie to set aside the default judgment entered against him. Defendant argues that he was not properly served with the summons and complaint and was unaware of the action until he received a notice of ruling in November 2023. The Judge notes that a default judgment entered against a defendant who was not served in the manner prescribed by statute is void, and that the Court may set aside such a judgment at any time.

The Judge finds that the service of the summons and complaint by substituted service on March 15, 2023, complied with the relevant statutes, including Code of Civil Procedure section 415.20, subdivision (b), which allows for service by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint with a competent member of the household or a person apparently in charge of the office or place of business. The Judge also notes that the process server made a good-faith attempt at physical service on a responsible person and notified the defendant by mailing the summons and complaint to his business address.

The Judge denies Defendant's motion to set aside the entry of default and also denies his request for a penalty against Plaintiff Law Offices of Rafi Moghadam APC and Rafi Moghadam, jointly and severally, in the amount of $1,000.00 and for an award of attorneys' fees in the amount of $3,705.00.
