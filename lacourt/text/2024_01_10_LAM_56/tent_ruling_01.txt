  JUDGMENT
 
Date:

Time: 8:30 a.m. 
Dept. 56
Jury Trial: April 8, 2024



 
MOVING
PARTY: Defendant Allied Physicians of California, PMC (“Moving Defendant”)
 
The
Court has considered the moving papers. 
No opposition papers were filed. 
Any opposition papers were required to have been filed and served at
least 14 days before the hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”)
section 437c, subdivision (b)(2).
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff’s
complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges: (1) general negligence.  In relevant part, the Complaint alleges:
Plaintiff visited Moving Defendant’s facility for an appointment on April 27,
2022.  (Complaint at p. 4.)  While waiting to be see, Plaintiff overheard
Physician’s Assistant Joseph Fung (“Fung”) ask a nurse, “Are you ready for
fish?”  (Id.)  This statement distressed Plaintiff, who had
been treated by Fung on April 6, 2022 for a possible UTI and vaginal odor and
interpreted the comment as a hurtful joke made at her expense.  (See id.)
 
On
June 28, 2023, Moving Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment (the
“Motion”) on the grounds that there are no triable issues of material fact and
Moving Defendant is therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
 
REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL
NOTICE
            Moving Defendant’s Request for Judicial Notice is
GRANTED.
 
DISCUSSION
The function of a motion for summary judgment or
adjudication is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party cannot
show evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and to enable an order of
summary dismissal without the need for trial.  (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.)  CCP section 437c, subdivision (c)
requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence
submitted, and all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence and
uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable
issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment
as a matter of law.  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7
Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)
 
As to each claim as framed by the complaint, the
defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial burden of proof
by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to establish a defense.  (CCP § 437c, subd. (p)(2); Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.)  Courts
liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that
party.  (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.  To establish a triable issue of material
fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive
evidence.  (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151, 166.)  
 
Undisputed
Material Facts
In support of the Motion, Moving Defendant provides
evidence that right before Plaintiff’s examination, Fung ate a fish
sandwich.  (Separate Statement of
Undisputed Material Facts (“UMF”) 4.) 
Before entering Plaintiff’s examination room, Fung asked a medical
assistant, Cristina Macias (“Macias”) if his breath smelled like fish.  (UMF 5.) 
Fung asked Macias this question because he wanted to conduct himself
professionally and did not want to have unpleasant breath when he met with
Plaintiff.  (UMF 6.)  At the time of Plaintiff’s visit, Fung had no
information about Plaintiff’s emotional or psychological history that may have indicated
that she may have had an increased sensitivity to overhearing the question he
asked Macias.  (See UMF 8.)   
 
 
 
 
Moving Defendant also provides the expert opinion
of Derrick P. Olzack, who provides the opinion that Fung’s conduct was
consistent with the standard of care for a licensed physician’s assistant in
California.  (See UMF 7.)
 
Professional
Negligence
The elements of a cause of action for medical
malpractice are: (1) a duty to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as other
members of the profession commonly possess and exercise; (2) a breach of the
duty; (3) a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the
injury; and (4) resulting loss or damage. 
(Johnson v. Superior Court (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 297, 305.)  As a general rule, the testimony of an expert
witness is required in every professional negligence case to establish the
applicable standard of care, whether that standard was met or breached by the
defendant, and whether any negligence by the defendant caused the plaintiff's
damages.  (Scott v. Rayhrer (2010)
185 Cal.App.4th 1535, 1542.)
 
            The Court finds that Moving
Defendant has met its burden to show that Plaintiff’s claim is not viable
because Fung did not breach the applicable standard of care when he treated
Plaintiff.[1]  As the Motion is unopposed, Plaintiff has not
satisfied her burden to introduce facts that create a triable issue of material
fact.  The Court therefore GRANTS the
Motion.  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
