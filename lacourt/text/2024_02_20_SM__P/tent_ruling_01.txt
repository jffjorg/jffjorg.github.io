Arsham Tabibian et
al. v. The Bungalow Santa Monica et al., Case No. 23SMCV00429
Hearing Date
February 20, 2024
Defendant Ocean
Avenue LLC’s Motion for Leave to File Cross-Complaint (UNOPPOSED) 
 
Plaintiffs Arsham
Tabibian and Mohammed Ali allege they were assaulted by a security guard
employed by defendants the Bungalow Santa Monica and Ocean Avenue LLC. Ocean
Avenue moves for leave to file a cross-complaint for indemnity, contribution,
and declaratory relief against ATF Private Security, an entity they allege
employed the guard directly. 
 
A cross-complaint against
a third party (i.e. a permissive cross-complaint) may be filed without leave any
time before trial is set. Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §428.50(b). Once trial has
been set, leave of the court is required to file a permissive cross-complaint,
and may be granted in the interest of justice at any time during the action. Id.
(c).  
 
Trial has not been
set in this matter, and the proposed cross-complaint is not a compulsory
cross-complaint against the plaintiff. Therefore, leave of the court is not
required to file it. Even if leave were required here, it would be readily
granted since doing so would serve the interest of justice, there is no opposition
to the motion and no evidence of prejudice to any party.
 
GRANTED.
