Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains in part and overrules in part the demurrers filed by Rajesh Thakkar and Nidhi Mittal to the second amended cross-complaint (SACC) filed by Satish Mahajan and Humble Retailers, Inc. The court sustains the demurrers as to the second cause of action for conversion, but overrules demurrers on all other grounds.

The court finds that the SACC fails to adequately allege a cause of action for conversion, as it does not demonstrate how Humble Retailers and Satish Mahajan were entitled to the profits of the Azusa market before the closing of escrow. The court also finds that the SACC fails to allege from where the prohibition on Thakkar and Mittal's assumption of control of the business prior to the close of escrow came.

On the other hand, the court overrules the demurrers to the first cause of action for breach of contract and the third cause of action for specific performance, as the SACC adequately alleges a cause of action for breach of contract and specific performance. The court also overrules the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for declaratory relief, as the SACC demonstrates the presence of an actual controversy between the parties regarding their obligations under the purchase agreement.

The court grants Thakkar and Mittal 20 days leave to amend their demurrers as to the second cause of action only.
