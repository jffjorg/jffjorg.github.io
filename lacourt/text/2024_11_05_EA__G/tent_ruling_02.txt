ANALYSIS
Mercedes-Benz
moves for a writ of possession against Michelle Terkelsen with regards to 2019
Mercedes-Benz E300W. For the following reasons, the court GRANTS Mercedes-Benz’s application.
Legal Standard
“California’s
claim and delivery law (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 511.010-516.050) authorizes the
issuance of a prejudgment writ of possession for specific personal property.” (Sea
Rail Truckloads, Inc. v. Pullman, Inc. (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 511, 514.)
“Except as otherwise provided this section, no writ shall be issued under this
chapter except after a hearing on a noticed motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
512.020, subd. (a).) Prior to the hearing, Plaintiff must serve Defendants
serve with (1) a copy of the summons and complaint, (2) a notice of application
and hearing, and (3) a copy of the application and any affidavit in support
thereof. (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.030, subd. (a).)
The
application for writ of possession must be executed under oath and include (1)
a “showing of the basis of the plaintiff’s claim and that the plaintiff is
entitled to possession of the property claimed” as well as a copy of the
written instrument if the basis of the claim is a written instrument, (2) a
“showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant,” (3) a
showing of “the manner in which the defendant came into possession of the
property,” (4) a showing of “the reason for the detention,” (5) a particular
description of the property and its value, (6) a statement of the location of
the property, including a showing that there is probable cause to believe the
property is located there if alleged to be within a private place, and (7) a “statement
that the property has not been taken for a tax, assessment, or fine” or “seized
under an execution against the property of the plaintiff[.]” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 512.010, subd. (b).)
Furthermore,
Code of Civil Procedure section 512.060 provides that a writ of possession
shall issue if the plaintiff meets the undertaking requirements of Code of
Civil Procedure section 515.010 and establishes the probable validity of their
claim to possession of the property. Code of Civil Procedure section 515.010
requires the plaintiff to file an undertaking of at least “twice the value of
the defendant’s interest in the property” with the court before the court
issues any writ of possession, unless the court finds defendants have “no
interest in the property.” “No writ directing the levying officer to enter a
private place to take possession of any property shall be issued unless the
plaintiff has established that there is probable cause to believe that the
property is located there.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 512.060, subd. (b).)
Discussion
In
this case, Mercedes-Benz moves for a writ of possession for a 2019
Mercedes-Benz E300W motor vehicle with serial number WDDZF4JB1KA585932.
The
court finds Mercedes-Benz has followed the statutory requirements of Code of
Civil Procedure sections 512.030 and 512.010. Pursuant to the motor vehicle
lease agreement at issue in this action, Michelle Terkelsen was required to
return possession of the subject vehicle upon the end of lease on February 28,
2023, and has failed to do. (McClurg Decl., ¶ 16, Ex. 1, § 22(1).) Mercedes-Benz
has also established they have a right to immediate possession of the subject
vehicle. (McClurg Decl., Ex. 1, § 23(c).) Michelle Terkelsen failed to oppose
this application or timely appear in this action. Because Mercedes-Benz has
shown a right to immediate possession of the subject vehicle and because it
remains in Michelle Terkelsen’s possession, The court waives Mercedez-Benz’s
undertaking requirement.  The¿undertaking
required by Michelle Terkelsen for redelivery or stay shall be $41,000.00. (Mercedez-Benz’s
estimation of damages - McClurg Decl., ¶ 24.) (See Code Civ. Proc., §
515.020.)
Accordingly,
the court GRANTS Mercedes-Benz’s application.
CONCLUSION
Based on the foregoing, Mercedes-Benz’s
application for a writ of possession against Michelle Terkelsen is GRANTED.
