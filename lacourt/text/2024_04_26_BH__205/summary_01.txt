The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding Plaintiff Nicolae Tanase's motion to continue a case management conference. The conference was initially set for January 9, 2023, but it's unclear if this was a typo, as the correct date might be January 9, 2024. Regardless, both the original and the revised dates have passed. The Court has denied both motions to continue as they are now moot. The case will proceed as scheduled.
