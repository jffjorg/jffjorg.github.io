This tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Shane Shahab Satey's motion for attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses in a dispute over an allegedly defective Tesla. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's brief exceeds the page limit set forth in the California Rules of Court and that there is no indication that Plaintiff sought or obtained permission to file a brief exceeding the limit. Therefore, the Court will not consider the late-filed brief. The Court also notes that the failure to abide by the page limits was not due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, and that Plaintiff may re-file a code-compliant motion.
