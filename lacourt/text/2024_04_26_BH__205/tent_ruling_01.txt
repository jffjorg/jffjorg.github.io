  Case Number:  23SMCV02261    Hearing Date:   April 26, 2024    Dept:  205 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205  NICOLAE TANASE,    Plaintiff, v.  ARMAN MINASYAN, et al.,    Defendants.    Case No.:  23SMCV02261     Hearing Date:  April 26, 2024   [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:   PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO CONTINUE        This hearing is on Plaintiff Nicolae Tanase’s motion to continue a case management conference set for January 9, 2023.  It is unclear if the date is a typo.  Regardless, the date has clearly passed, even if Plaintiff meant to say January 9, 2024.  There is another document filed by Plaintiff (without a noticed hearing date or reservation number) that seeks to continue a case manaagement conference set for March 8, 2024.  That date and case management conference also have passed.   Accordingly, the Court denies both motions as moot.  IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: April 26, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
