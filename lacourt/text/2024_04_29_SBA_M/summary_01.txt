And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has tentatively ruled on several issues. Firstly, the demurrer to the third cause of action for fraud is overruled, as the plaintiffs have alleged specific facts of misrepresentations regarding the contractors' license status of Defendant's preferred vendors. Secondly, the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for negligent misrepresentation and fraud is also overruled, as the plaintiffs have alleged specific facts of misrepresentations and knowledge of the falsity and intent to deceive. Thirdly, the court has granted the motion for determination of good faith settlement, as the settlement of $7,000 is deemed to be in good faith.
