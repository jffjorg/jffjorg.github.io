Demurrer
 
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a
matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v. Foundation Health
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In
testing the sufficiency of the complaint, the court must assume the truth of
(1) the properly pleaded factual allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably
inferred from those expressly pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) 
The Court may not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of
fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe
(1994) 7 Cal.App.4th 634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency
of a complaint, the plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts
sufficient to establish every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw v. California Physicians
Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) 
Where the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.  (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County of
Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
 
Sufficient facts are the essential facts of the case
"with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently specific to
acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his cause of
action.”  (Gressley v. Williams
(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.) 
"Whether the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is
irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer." 
(Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605,
609–610.)  Under Code Civil Procedure §
430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is “uncertain.”  Uncertainty exists where a complaint’s
factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently apprise a
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
 
Meet and Confer
 
Defendant set forth a meet and confer declaration in
sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41. (Decl., Susan J. Welde, ¶¶ 2-4.) 
 
Demurrer
 
Defendant Liberty Insurance Corporation demurs to the
third and fourth causes of action for failure to state sufficient facts to
state a cause of action. CCP § 430.10(e).  
 
Third Cause of Action for Fraud 
 
The demurrer to the third cause of action is
overruled. Plaintiffs state facts sufficient to state the cause of action. 
 
“A complaint for fraud must allege the following
elements: (1) a knowingly false representation by the defendant; (2) an intent
to deceive or induce reliance; (3) justifiable reliance by the plaintiff; and
(4) resulting damages.”  Service by
Medallion, Inc. v. Clorox Co. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1807, 1816. “[T]he
elements of an action for fraud and deceit based on a concealment are: (1) the
defendant must have concealed or suppressed a material fact, (2) the defendant
must have been under a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff, (3) the
defendant must have intentionally concealed or suppressed the fact with the
intent to defraud the plaintiff, (4) the plaintiff must have been unaware of
the fact and would not have acted as he did if he has known of the concealed or
suppressed fact, and (5) as a result of the concealment or suppression of the
fact, the plaintiff must have sustained damage.” Boschma v. Home Loan
Center, Inc. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 230, 248.
 
“Every element of the cause of action for fraud must
be alleged in the proper manner and the facts constituting the fraud must be
alleged with sufficient specificity to allow defendant to understand fully the
nature of the charge made.”  Tarmann
v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.  Plaintiffs must state facts which “show how,
when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were
tendered.”  Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645.
 
Plaintiffs have alleged specific facts of alleged
misrepresentations regarding the contractors’ license status of Defendant’s
preferred vendors including facts of who, to whom, how, when, where, and by
what means the representations were made. (4AC, ¶¶ 53-54, 120.)  Plaintiffs have alleged specific facts of
knowledge of the falsity and intent to deceive. (4AC, ¶¶ 55-57.) Plaintiffs
have alleged specific facts to meet the element of justifiable reliance. Plaintiffs
now allege that the representations substantially influenced Plaintiffs’
decision to allow the Rainbow defendants to work on the property. (4AC, ¶¶ 121,
127.)  Plaintiffs have alleged resulting
damages. (4AC, ¶ 128.) 
 
Defendant’s demurrer to the third cause of action is overruled.

 
Fourth Cause of Action for Negligent Misrepresentation
and Fraud – Contractor Status
 
Defendant’s demurrer is overruled. Plaintiffs state
facts sufficient to state a cause of action.
 
“The elements of negligent misrepresentation are (1)
the misrepresentation of a past or existing material fact, (2) without
reasonable ground for believing it to be true, (3) with intent to induce
another's reliance on the fact misrepresented, (4) justifiable reliance on the
misrepresentation, and (5) resulting damage. While there is some conflict in
the case law discussing the precise degree of particularity required in the
pleading of a claim for negligent misrepresentation, there is a consensus that the
causal elements, particularly the allegations of reliance, must be specifically
pleaded.” National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA v. Cambridge
Integrated Services Group, Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 35, 50 (internal
citations and quotations omitted).
 
Alternatively, with the fourth cause of action,
Plaintiffs allege that the above noted representations were made despite the
fact that Defendant should have known of their falsity – thus, without
reasonable ground for believing them to be true. (4AC, ¶ 131.)  The other elements of the cause of action are
well stated for the same reasons already noted above. 
 
Defendant’s demurrer to the fourth cause of action is
overruled. 
 
Defendant is ordered to file and serve an Answer
within 10 days of this date. 
 
Motion for Determination of Good Faith Settlement
 
Farmers Insurance Exchange’s (“Farmers”) Motion for
Determination of Good Faith Settlement is granted.  
 
Farmers’ request for judicial notice is granted
pursuant to Evid. Code § 452(d).
 
Farmers Insurance Exchange moves for an order finding
that the settlement between Plaintiffs and Farmers was made in good faith
pursuant to CCP §§ 877 and 877.6.
 
“[Code of Civil Procedure] Section 877.6 was enacted
by the Legislature in 1980 to establish a statutory procedure for determining
if a settlement by an alleged joint tortfeasor has been entered into in good
faith and to provide a bar to claims of other alleged joint tortfeasors for
equitable contribution or partial or comparative indemnity when good faith is
shown.”  IRM Corp. v. Carlson (1986) 179 Cal. App. 3d 94, 104.
 
CCP § 877.6(a)(1) provides, in relevant part, that, on
noticed motion, “[a]ny party to an action wherein it is alleged that two or
more parties are joint tortfeasors or co-obligors on a contract debt shall be
entitled to a hearing on the issue of the good faith of a settlement entered
into by the plaintiff . . . and one or more alleged tortfeasors or co-obligors
. . . .”  “A determination by the court
that the settlement was made in good faith shall bar any other joint tortfeasor
or co-obligor from any further claims against the settling tortfeasor or
co-obligor for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative
indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault.”  CCP § 877.6(c).  Although a determination that a settlement
was in good faith does not discharge any other party from liability, “it shall
reduce the claims against the others in the amount stipulated” by the
settlement.  CCP § 877(a).    
 
In Tech-Bilt,
Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde & Associates (1985) 38 Cal.3d 488, 499, the
California Supreme Court identified the following nonexclusive factors courts
are to consider in determining if a settlement is in good faith under section
877.6:  “a rough approximation of
plaintiffs' total recovery and the settlor's proportionate liability, the
amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among
plaintiffs, and a recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than
he would if he were found liable after a trial. 
Other relevant considerations include the financial conditions and
insurance policy limits of settling defendants, as well as the existence of
collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of
nonsettling defendants.”  
 
The evaluation of whether a settlement was made in
good faith is required to “be made on the basis of information available at the
time of settlement.”  Tech-Bilt, 38 Cal.3d at 499.  “‘[A] defendant’s settlement figure must not
be grossly disproportionate to what a reasonable person, at the time of the
settlement, would estimate the settling defendant’s liability to be.’ [Citation.]”  Id.
at 499.  
 
“The party asserting the lack of good faith, who has
the burden of proof on that issue (§ 877.6, subd. (d)), should be permitted to
demonstrate, if he can, that the settlement is so far ‘out of the ballpark’ in
relation to these factors as to be inconsistent with the equitable objectives
of the statute.  Such a demonstration
would establish that the proposed settlement was not a ‘settlement made in good
faith’ within the terms of section 877.6.” 
Tech-Bilt, 38 Cal.3d at
499-500.  
 
 “Thus, Tech-Bilt held that in determining
whether a settlement was made in good faith for purposes of section 877.6, a
key factor a trial court should consider is whether the amount paid in
settlement bears a reasonable relationship to the settlor’s proportionate share
of liability. (Tech-Bilt, supra, 38
Cal.3d at pp. 499–500 . . . .)  This is
because one of the main goals of section 877.6 is ‘allocating costs equitably
among multiple tortfeasors.’  (Tech-Bilt, supra, 38 Cal.3d at p. 502 .
. . .).”  TSI Seismic Tenant Space, Inc. v. Superior Court (2007) 149 Cal.
App. 4th 159, 166. 
“Accordingly, a court not only looks at the alleged tortfeasor's
potential liability to the plaintiff, but it must also consider the culpability
of the tortfeasor vis-à-vis other parties alleged to be responsible for the
same injury.  Potential liability for
indemnity to a nonsettling defendant is an important consideration for the
trial court in determining whether to approve a settlement by an alleged
tortfeasor.  [Citation.]”  Id.
at 166.
 
No written opposition has been filed to this
motion.  When a motion for determination
of good faith settlement is uncontested, a “barebones” motion that sets forth
the ground of good faith, accompanied by a declaration which sets forth a brief
background of the case, is sufficient to support a good faith
determination.  City of Grand Terrace v. Superior Court (1987) 192 Cal. App. 3d
1251, 1261.  Moving Defendant has
provided evidence showing the amount of the settlement and a brief background
of the case.  (Declarations, Brieanna
Dolmage, Zeina Nehme; Request for Judicial Notice.) The Court finds that this
evidence is sufficient to support a good faith determination.   
 
Therefore, Defendant’s Motion for Determination of
Good Faith Settlement is granted. Defendant’s settlement with Plaintiff in the
amount of $7,000 is deemed to be in good faith.
 
Because the Court has determined that the settlement
was made in good faith, the determination “shall bar any other joint tortfeasor
or co-obligor from any further claims against the settling tortfeasor or
co-obligor for equitable comparative contribution, or partial or comparative
indemnity, based on comparative negligence or comparative fault.” Code Civ.
Proc., § 877.6(c).
 
Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
