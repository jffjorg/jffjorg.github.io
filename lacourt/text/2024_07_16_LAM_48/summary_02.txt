And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying a motion filed by Cross-Defendant Oscar De La Hoya to compel further responses from Cross-Complainant Gina Ruccione regarding a Request for Production No. 1. The motion was filed on November 1, 2023, and sought documents related to any final or draft agreement, compromise, or settlement between Ruccione and the parties in this action. The judge found that the request was overbroad and sought information that is inadmissible under Evidence Code sections 1119, 1121, 1152, and 1154. Additionally, the judge determined that Cross-Defendant De La Hoya did not show good cause for the discovery sought and that the Court did not authorize discovery about a good faith settlement. The judge denied the motion and ordered Cross-Defendant De La Hoya to give notice.
