[1] An
individual named Jin Ree at East West Legal has contacted Plaintiff on behalf of
Douglas Kwi Ching and Kathy Kwang Nam Ching “as registered legal document assistant
and certified interpreter and the authorized person for settlement and manager for
remote control, etc.”  (Fitzgerald Decl. ¶¶
2-3 & Ex. A.)  Plaintiff provides a copy
of the State Bar’s partial list of Unlicensed Practice of Law Cease and Desist Notices.  “Jin Ree, aka Jin Rie, dba East West Legal of
Los Angeles” was sent such a notice on February 8, 2022.  As of the date of this order, Jin Ree/Rie still
is not a licensed attorney with the State Bar of California and cannot file anything
on behalf of other parties.  At this time,
the Court will not enter an order under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, subdivision
(f)(1)(D)—as requested by Plaintiff (Opposition at pp. 3-4)—because Jin Ree has
not engaged in any conduct before this Court and is not “an attorney, law firm,
or party” in this action.  Douglas Kwi Ching
and Kathy Kwang Nam Ching are warned, however, that Jin Ree may not act as their
counsel and cannot file the Answer on their behalf.
