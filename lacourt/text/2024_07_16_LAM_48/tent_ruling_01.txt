  CASE NO.: 20STCV25026
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING PETITION TO APPROVE
  MINOR’S COMPROMISE
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
July 16, 2024



 
Claimant
C.R., a minor, by and through his guardian ad litem, L Mayra
N. Rodriguez, has agreed to settle his claims against Defendants Los Angeles
Unified School District, Luis Rodriguez-Cazares, and Karen Fattal in exchange for
$139,500.00.  Of this amount, $726.47 is
allocated for a Medi-Cal lien, $55,800.00 is allocated for attorney fees, and $27,351.68
is allocated for costs and expenses, leaving a balance of $55,621.90 for Claimant.  If approved, the funds will be deposited into
a blocked account, subject to withdrawal only upon authorization of the court.
Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code
Civ. Proc., § 372.)  The Court has reviewed
the proposed settlement and cannot find that it is fair and reasonable at this
time.  Although Claimant’s guardian
agreed to pay up to 45% of any settlement as attorney fees and all costs and
expenses (Petition, Ex. 17(a)), the $55,800.00 in attorney fees and $27,351.68 in
costs and expenses are a combined 59.6% of the total settlement amount.  After all expenses, Claimant will receive
only about 39.8% of the total settlement amount.
At
the hearing, counsel should be prepared to more thoroughly address the factors
of California Rules of Court, rule 7.955(b) to justify such a high amount of
attorney fees and expenses.  Otherwise,
the Court is inclined to deny the petition without prejudice.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
