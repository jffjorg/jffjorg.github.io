This tentative ruling addresses a dispute regarding Jin Ree's unauthorized practice of law. Jin Ree, who is not a licensed attorney with the State Bar of California, has been acting as a registered legal document assistant and certified interpreter for Douglas Kwi Ching and Kathy Kwang Nam Ching. The Court has received a Cease and Desist Notice sent to Jin Ree on February 8, 2022. The Plaintiff has requested an order under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, but the Court will not enter such an order as Jin Ree has not engaged in any conduct before the Court and is not a party to this action. The Court warns Jin Ree and the Chings that Jin Ree may not act as their counsel and cannot file the Answer on their behalf.
