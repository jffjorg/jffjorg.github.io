And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motions for summary adjudication, attorney fees, and to quash subpoena. The court has ordered the parties to revise their separate statements to include only material facts pertinent to the disposition of the motion. The motion for attorney fees is denied, and the motion to quash subpoena is granted as to Request No. 2.

The court has also continued the hearing on the motion for summary adjudication to October 8, 2024. The parties are ordered to file revised separate statements and responses by September 26, 2024.

The court's ruling is based on the parties' lengthy and non-material separate statements, which do not serve their intended purpose. The court expects the revised separate statements to be significantly shorter and more focused.

The judge has also ruled that the motion for attorney fees is denied because the motion is no longer moot and the defendants have not been prejudiced by the filing of the second amended complaint.
