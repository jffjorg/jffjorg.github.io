Summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the petition to approve the minor's compromise. The compromise is between Claimant C.R. and the defendants, including the Los Angeles Unified School District, Luis Rodriguez-Cazares, and Karen Fattal. The settlement amount is $139,500.00, with $726.47 allocated for a Medi-Cal lien, $55,800.00 for attorney fees, and $27,351.68 for costs and expenses. The Court finds that the proposed settlement is not fair and reasonable due to the high amount of attorney fees and costs, which total 59.6% of the settlement amount. The Court is inclined to deny the petition without prejudice and requests that counsel justify the high amount of attorney fees and expenses at the hearing.
