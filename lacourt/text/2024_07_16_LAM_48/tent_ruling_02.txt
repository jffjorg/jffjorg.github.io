  CASE NO.: 21STCP04124
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING CROSS-DEFENDANT’S
  MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
July 16, 2024



 
On November 1, 2023, Cross-Defendant
Oscar De La Hoya filed a motion to compel further responses from Cross-Complainant
Gina Ruccione for Request for Production No. 1.
A
party may move to compel a further response to a demand for production of documents
if the demanding party deems that the statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete; the representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete,
or evasive; or an objection in the response is without merit or too general.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)  The motion must set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).)
RFP
No. 1 asks Ruccione to “Produce all DOCUMENTS, including COMMUNICATIONS, RELATING
TO any final or draft agreement, compromise, or settlement between RUCCIONE and
CME PARTIES, or any of them, that RELATES TO the ACTION.”  Ruccione provided only objections.
De
La Hoya argues that the requested documents are “directly relevant to Ruccione’s
claims for damages against De La Hoya and his defenses against the same” because
he “is entitled to a setoff from any award of damages in the amount of settlements,
if any, paid by the settling cross-defendants.” 
(Motion at p. 4.)  He also requires
the terms of the settlement agreements “so that he may determine whether he may
be entitled to indemnity and/or contribution.” 
(Ibid.)
De
La Hoya contends that “the Court specifically ordered that discovery relating to
the issue of ‘good faith settlement’ would be permitted.”  That is not accurate.  On August 3, 2023, the Court continued the trial
date and ordered, “Discovery and motion deadlines are not reset based on the new
Trial date except for expert discovery, good faith settlement, deposition of Oscar
de la Hoya (with document production), and such other items as may be shown to have
good cause.”  The Court did not authorize
discovery about a good faith settlement. 
In any event, no party has filed a motion for determination of good faith
settlement, and everyone except Ruccione and De La Hoya has been dismissed from
this action.
De
La Hoya has not shown good cause for this discovery.  RFP No. 1 is overbroad and seeks information that
is inadmissible under Evidence Code sections 1119, 1121, 1152, and 1154.  The Court will not attempt to narrow such an overbroad
request.
The
motion to compel further responses to RFP No. 1 is DENIED.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
