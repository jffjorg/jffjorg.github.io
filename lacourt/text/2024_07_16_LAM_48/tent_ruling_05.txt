[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO COMPEL
  COMPLIANCE WITH RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
July 16, 2024




 


 


 



 
On
March 22, 2024, Plaintiff Isabel Kilroe served 11 Requests For Production of Documents
on Defendant FCA US LLC.  On May 27, 2024,
Defendant served responses, which stated that it “will comply in full” with RFP
Nos. 1-8.
On
June 14, 2024 and May 7, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion to compel Defendant’s compliance
with its responses about production.  Defendant
did not file an opposition.
If
a party filing a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling
thereafter fails to permit the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in accordance
with that party’s statement of compliance, the demanding party may move for an order
compelling compliance.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.320, subd. (a).)
Defendant’s
responses declaring that it would comply in full with RFP Nos. 1-8 were made on
May 27, 2024, but Defendant still has not produced any documents.
The
unopposed motion to compel is GRANTED.  Defendant
is ordered to produce all responsive documents for RFP Nos. 1-8 within 30 days.
The
request for sanctions is GRANTED.  Sanctions
are imposed only on Defendant’s counsel and not on Defendant itself.  Defendant’s counsel is ORDERED to pay sanctions
of $3,110.00 to Plaintiff within 30 days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
