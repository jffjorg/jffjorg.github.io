And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a demurrer filed by Douglas Kwi Ching, as Trustee of The Douglas Kwi Ching and Kathy Kwang Nam Ching Revocable Trust Dated 10/19/99, on behalf of himself and Kathy Kwang Nam Ching as Trustees. The demurrer argues that the complaint does not state a cause of action, that Plaintiff lacks standing to bring the claim, and that the action is frivolous. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the complaint sufficiently alleges that Plaintiff has standing to bring an action under the Unruh Civil Rights Act. The judge has also ordered the defendants to file an answer no later than September 17, 2024.

Additionally, the judge has ruled that Douglas Kwi Ching, as a non-attorney trustee, cannot represent himself or Kathy Kwang Nam Ching as Trustees in this action. The judge has ordered the defendants to retain licensed counsel and has scheduled an Order to Show Cause Re: Retention of Counsel for September 17, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. If the defendants have not retained counsel and filed an answer by that date, the court may place them in default.
