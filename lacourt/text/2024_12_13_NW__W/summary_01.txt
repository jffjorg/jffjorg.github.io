The judge has granted the motion filed by Richard Jacobson and Jennifer Jacobson to set aside the dismissal of their case against Valley Oaks III Condominium Association, Hilda Viscarra, Wendy Duran, and Humberto Granados. The judge finds that the dismissal was taken against the plaintiffs due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect by their counsel.

The judge's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure Section 473(b), which provides for relief from dismissal under certain circumstances. The judge notes that the request for relief is timely and that the plaintiffs' counsel's failure to appear for the hearing was due to excusable neglect, mistake, and surprise.
