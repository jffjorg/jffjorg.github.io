And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Coastline Real Estate Advisors, Inc.'s motion to strike the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) filed by Christopher Nowlin, et al. The motion was based on the alleged untimely filing of the SAC and the addition or change of allegations without leave to amend.

The judge found that the filing of the SAC, which was late by three calendar days and one court day, did not affect the substantial rights of any of the parties. The judge also found that the minor amendments to the SAC did not alter the tenor of the plaintiffs' claims and/or allegations in any material way.

The judge also denied the request to strike the seventh cause of action, which was previously a cause of action for Intentional Misrepresentation and was changed to a cause of action for False Promise. The judge found that False Promise is a species of fraud and that the amended allegations directly responded to the court's prior ruling striking the prayer and allegations of attorneys' fees with leave to amend to plead a statutory or contractual basis for such fees.

The judge ordered Coastline Real Estate Advisors, Inc. to file and serve an Answer within 10 days of the date of the ruling, and ordered the plaintiffs to give notice of the ruling.
