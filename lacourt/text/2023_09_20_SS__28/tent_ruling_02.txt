 Case Number:  20STCV39795    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2023    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
October 16, 2020, Plaintiff Hongde Cui (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Defendants Ting Kwan Chan (“Chan”), Daniel Yanez
(“Yanez”), and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle and general negligence. 
On
February 3, 2022, Chan filed an answer and a cross-complaint against
Cross-Defendants Yanez and Roes 1-10 for implied indemnity, total indemnity,
declaratory relief and apportionment of fault. 
On
March 7, 2022, Yanez filed an answer and a cross-complaint against
Cross-Defendants Chan and Roes 1-25 for indemnity, apportionment of fault and
declaratory relief. 
On
November 7, 2022, the Court granted the parties’ stipulated request to continue
the trial to July 10, 2023. 
On May
18, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s ex parte unopposed application to
continue the trial to October 31, 2023. 
          On July 17, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s
motion to be relieved as counsel. 
On
July 27, 2023, Chan filed a motion to continue the trial, to be heard on
September 20, 2023.  No opposition has been
filed. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for October 31, 2023. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Chan
requests that the Court continue the trial to February 2, 2024, and continue
discovery and motion cut-off dates to trail the new trial date. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(b), provides that “a party seeking a continuance of
the date set for trial, whether contested or uncontested or stipulated to by
the parties, must make the request for a continuance by a noticed motion or an
ex parte application under the rules in chapter 4 of this division, with
supporting declarations. The party must make the motion or application as soon
as reasonably practical once the necessity for the continuance is discovered.” 
          Under
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c), the Court may grant a continuance
only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance.
Circumstances that may indicate good cause include “a party's excused inability
to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite
diligent efforts,” or the unavailability of a party, counsel, or expert due to
death, illness or other excusable circumstance. The Court should consider all
facts and circumstances relevant to the determination, such as proximity of the
trial date, prior continuances, prejudice suffered, whether all parties have
stipulated to a continuance, and whether the interests of justice are served.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).) 
DISCUSSION 
Chan
states that he cannot complete discovery before the currently-scheduled trial date
despite his due diligence.  The parties agreed
to settle the case in November 2022, but the settlement fell apart after
Plaintiff’s former counsel lost contact with Plaintiff and moved to be relieved
as counsel.  Plaintiff currently does not
have counsel and no party has been able to contact Plaintiff to complete
discovery. 
The
Court finds good cause to grant the requested continuance. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court
GRANTS Defendant Ting Kwan Chan’s motion to continue the trial and related
dates.  The Court continues the trial to February
2, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 28 of the Spring Street Courthouse. The
Final Status Conference is January 19, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 28 of
the Spring Street Courthouse. All related motion and discovery dates will trail
the new trial date. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is are ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
