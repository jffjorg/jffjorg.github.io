## English Text Summary:

The judge considered a demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant Jamie Goldstein in a case involving Plaintiff Farideh Davoudpour's claims for personal injuries, emotional distress, and battery stemming from a dog attack.

The judge overruled Goldstein's demurrer to the claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress and battery, finding that the complaint adequately alleged the necessary elements for those claims.

The judge gave Plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint to potentially reinstate the punitive damages claim.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the moving papers and issued a tentative ruling in this case. The plaintiff, Farideh Davoudpour, filed a lawsuit against the defendant, Jamie A. Goldstein, and others for personal injuries, strict liability, premises liability, negligence, and battery. Goldstein filed a demurrer and a motion to strike to be heard on September 20, 2023. The plaintiff did not file an opposition.

The judge ruled that Goldstein's demurrer to the claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress and battery is overruled. The court found that the plaintiff's allegations of negligent infliction of emotional distress are sufficient to withstand the demurrer, and that the allegations of battery are also sufficient.

However, the judge granted Goldstein's motion to strike the punitive damage claim. The court found that the allegations in the complaint do not show that Goldstein acted with malice, fraud, or oppression, as required to support a claim for punitive damages.

The judge ordered that the moving party give notice of this ruling and file proof of service within five days of the date of the hearing.

English summary:
The case number is 21STCV37100 and the hearing date is September 20, 2023. The plaintiff, Farideh Davoudpour, filed a lawsuit against defendants Jamie A. Goldstein, Erica Gerard, and Erica Gerard Family Trust for personal injuries, strict liability, premises liability, negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and battery. On August 24, 2023, defendant Goldstein filed a demurrer and a motion to strike. The plaintiff did not file an opposition.

Goldstein requested that the court sustain the demurrer to the causes of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress and battery, and strike the punitive damage claim.

The court considered the legal standard for a demurrer and motion to strike. A demurrer can be sustained if the pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, or if the pleading is uncertain. A motion to strike can be granted if the matter is irrelevant, false, or improper.

The court overruled the demurrer to the NIED claim and the battery claim. The plaintiff alleged that Goldstein's negligent conduct in allowing the dog to attack her caused her to suffer severe emotional distress, and that defendants caused a harmful or offensive contact with the plaintiff's body. These allegations were sufficient to state a claim for NIED and battery.

The court granted the motion to strike the punitive damage claim because the first amended complaint did not allege facts showing that Goldstein acted with malice, fraud, or oppression.

In conclusion, the court overruled defendant Goldstein's demurrer to plaintiff Davoudpour's claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress and battery, and granted the motion to strike plaintiff Davoudpour's claim for punitive damages with 30 days leave to amend.
