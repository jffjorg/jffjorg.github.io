LEGAL STANDARD  
 Code of Civil Procedure section
  2023.030 provides in part: 
 “To
  the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery
  method or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any
  affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may
  impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a
  misuse of the discovery process: 
 “(a)
  The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the
  misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or
  both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
  anyone as a result of that conduct. The court may also impose this sanction
  on one unsuccessfully asserting that another has engaged in the misuse of the
  discovery process, or on any attorney who advised that assertion, or on both.
  If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this title, the
  court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the
  sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
  make the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
 *
  * *
  “(d)
  The court may impose a terminating sanction by one of the following orders: 
 “(1)
  An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party
  engaging in the misuse of the discovery process. 
 “(2)
  An order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery
  is obeyed. 
 “(3)
  An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party. 
 “(4)
  An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
  2023.030, subds. (a), (d).) 
 A violation of a discovery
  order supports the imposition of terminating sanctions. (Collison &
  Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.) Terminating
  sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court's
  orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 795-796 (Deyo).) 
 A terminating sanction is a
  "drastic measure which should be employed with caution." (Deyo,
  supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "A decision to order terminating
  sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful,
  preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
  sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court
  is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v. Tenet
  Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.) 
DISCUSSION




 On June 12, 2023, the Court
  granted Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition and ordered
  Plaintiff to appear for a deposition within 30 days of the hearing on the
  motion.  The Court also granted
  Defendant’s request for sanctions and ordered Plaintiff to pay Defendant
  $510.00 in sanctions within 30 days of the hearing on the motion. 
 On June 21, 2023, Defendant
  served a deposition notice setting Plaintiff’s deposition on July 14,
  2023.  Plaintiff did not appear at the July
  14 deposition and did not communicate with Defendant to schedule a different,
  mutually agreeable date. 
 The Court grants the motion
  for terminating sanctions because the Court does not believe that a less
  severe sanction would produce compliance with the discovery rules. 
 Defendant requests monetary
  sanctions of $1,833.30 based on 3 hour of attorney’s work at a rate of
  $200.00 per hour, a non-appearance fee of $1,171.65, and 1 $61.65 filling
  fee. 
 The Court awards $1,433.30
  based on based on 1 hour of attorney’s work at a rate of $200.00 per hour, a
  non-appearance fee of $1,171.65, and 1 $61.65 filling fee.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c),
  2031.300, subd. (c), 2023.010, subd. (g).) 
CONCLUSION 
 The Court GRANTS Defendant
  Concepcion Flores Garcia’s motion to dismiss Plaintiff Jeffrey Buteyn’s
  complaint.  The Court dismisses the
  complaint filed by Plaintiff Jeffrey Buteyn with prejudice under Code of
  Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision (d)(3). 
 The Court GRANTS Defendant
  Concepcion Flores Garcia’s request for sanctions. Plaintiff Jeffrey Buteyn is
  ordered to pay $1,433.30 in sanctions to Defendant within 30 days of the
  hearing on the motion. 
 Defendant is ordered to
  give notice of this ruling.
