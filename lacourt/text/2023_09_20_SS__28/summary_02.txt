And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Honorable Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 20STCV39795. The case involves a motor vehicle accident and was filed on October 16, 2020. The Plaintiff, Hongde Cui, is suing the Defendant, Ting Kwan Chan, for negligence. The case has been ongoing for several years, with multiple continuances granted to the parties.

The Defendant, Ting Kwan Chan, has filed a motion to continue the trial to February 2, 2024, citing that he is unable to complete discovery before the currently-scheduled trial date. The Plaintiff does not have counsel and has been unable to contact the Plaintiff to complete discovery.

The Judge has found good cause to grant the requested continuance, citing the parties' agreement to settle the case in November 2022, which fell apart due to the Plaintiff's former counsel losing contact with the Plaintiff. The Judge has continued the trial to February 2, 2024, and has set a final status conference for January 19, 2024. All related motion and discovery dates will trail the new trial date.
