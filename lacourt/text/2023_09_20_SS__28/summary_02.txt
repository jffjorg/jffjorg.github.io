The Defendant, Ting Kwan Chan, has filed a motion to continue the trial to February 2, 2024, citing that he is unable to complete discovery before the currently-scheduled trial date. The Plaintiff does not have counsel and has been unable to contact the Plaintiff to complete discovery.

The Judge has found good cause to grant the requested continuance, citing the parties' agreement to settle the case in November 2022, which fell apart due to the Plaintiff's former counsel losing contact with the Plaintiff. The Judge has continued the trial to February 2, 2024, and has set a final status conference for January 19, 2024. All related motion and discovery dates will trail the new trial date.
