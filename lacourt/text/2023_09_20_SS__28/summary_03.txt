And here is a summary in English:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Concepcion Flores Garcia's motion to dismiss Plaintiff Jeffrey Buteyn's complaint with prejudice, citing Plaintiff's failure to appear at a court-ordered deposition. The Court also awards Defendant $1,433.30 in sanctions due to Plaintiff's non-compliance with the discovery process. The Judge finds that a less severe sanction would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, and therefore grants the motion for terminating sanctions.
