On March 25, 2021, the Court  dismissed the County from the complaint  without prejudice at Plaintiffs’ request.  On  September 14, 2020, Washington and LACMTA filed an answer and a cross-complaint  against Cross-Defendants Ofelia Hagnazar Gharebeigi and Roes 1-10 for total  indemnity, equitable indemnity on a comparative fault basis, declaratory  relief, and motor vehicle negligence. On October 26, 2020, Cross-Defendant  Ofelia Hagnazar Gharebeigi filed an answer.  On  October 26, 2020, Defendants and Cross-Complainants Ofelia Hagnazar Gharebeigi,  Roben Gharabeigi, and Nairi Karapetian filed an answer and a cross-complaint  against Cross- Defendants Johnson-Bokelberg, Washington, LACMTA, the County,  and Roes 1-100 for indemnity, comparative contribution, and declaratory relief.  On November 19, 2020, Johnson- Bokelberg filed an answer. On November 23, 2020,  the County filed an answer. On December 1, 2020, Washington and LACMTA filed an  answer. On March 25, 2021, the Court dismissed Johnson-Bokelberg and the County  from the cross-complaint with prejudice at Cross- Complainants’ request. On May  12, 2021, the Court again dismissed Johnson-Bokelberg from the cross-complaint  with prejudice.  On  May 25, 2021, Plaintiff amended the complaint to add Defendant Sosy’s Flower’s  [sic] & Gifts as Doe 1.  On  September 6, 2022, the Court dismissed Defendants Ofelia Hagnazar Gharebeigi,  Roben Gharabeigi, and Nairi Karapetian with prejudice at Plaintiffs’ request.  On  November 4, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a notice of conditional settlement.  B.   Case number 20STCV47135  On  December 9, 2020, Plaintiff Ofelia Hagnazar Gharebeigi filed a complaint  against Defendants LACMTA and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle tort and general  negligence.

On  November 10, 2021, the Court consolidated the cases.  D.   Motion to enforce settlement  On  August 1, 2023, Johnson-Bokelberg filed a motion to enforce a settlement and award  judgment and sanctions against LACMTA.   On September 7, 2023, LACMTA filed an opposition and request for  sanctions.  PARTIES’ REQUESTS  Johnson-Bokelberg requests that the Court enforce a settlement agreement, enter judgment  for Johnson-Bokelberg for $74,147.67, and impose $9,147.67 in sanctions on  LACMTA.  LACMTA  requests that the Court deny the motion and impose sanctions of $2,300.00 on Johnson-Bokelberg.  LEGAL STANDARD                    Code  of Civil Procedure section 664.6 provides in part:  “(a) If parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a  writing signed by the parties outside of the presence of the court or orally  before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon  motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If  requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to  enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the  settlement.  “(b) For purposes of this section, a writing is signed  by a party if it is signed by any of the following:  “(1) The party.  “(2) An attorney who represents the party.  “(3) If the party is an insurer, an agent who is  authorized in writing by the insurer to sign on the insurer’s behalf.”  (Code  Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subds. (a), (b).)  In  deciding motions made under section 664.6, courts “must determine whether the  parties entered into a valid and binding settlement.”  (Kohn v. Jaymar-Ruby (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th  1530, 1533.)  On a motion to enforce a  settlement under section 664.6, courts have the power to decide disputed facts  and to interpret the agreement.  (Fiore  v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal.App.3d 561, 566; L. Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal.  Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (Rutter 2023) ¶¶ 12:977–12:978.5, pp.  12(ll)-139 to 12(ll)-140.) Courts may receive evidence, determine disputed  facts including the terms the parties previously agreed on, and enter the terms  of a settlement agreement as a judgment, but they may not create new material  terms. (Osumi v. Sutton (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1355, 1360.)  DISCUSSION  Johnson-Bokelberg  asserts that, on June 29, 2022, she and LACMTA entered into a  written settlement agreement which is attached as an exhibit to her counsel’s  declaration.  According to Johnson-Bokelberg,  the settlement agreement requires that LACMTA pay Johnson-Bokelberg $74,147.67.  Johnson-Bokelberg  argues that LACMTA has breached the agreement.    To  support her motion, Johnson-Bokelberg has submitted a  release that only she signed on June 29, 2022.  (Exhibit 1 to the Declaration of Sutton A.  Shapiro, Esq.)  LACMTA did not sign the release.  As a result, Johnson-Bokelberg has not proved  the existence of “a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the  court or orally before the court” agreeing to settle the case for purposes of  Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.   LACMTA  does not dispute that the parties agreed to settle the case and acknowledges  that “a significant amount of time has passed since receipt of all signed  Releases.”  (Opposition p. 4.)  According to LACMTA, however, the parties did  not agree on a deadline for payment of the settlement amount to Johnson-Bokelberg.  LACMTA attributes the delay in payment to the  need for Claims Committee approval of the settlement, which occurred after Johnson-Bokelberg  filed her motion to enforce the settlement.  Despite  Johnson-Bokelberg’s understandable frustration at the delay in receiving her  settlement check, her motion to enforce the settlement is frivolous.  Johnson-Bokelberg’s arguments are not “warranted  by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification,  or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law” (Code Civ. Proc., §  128.5, subd. (f)((2)(A)).  She cannot satisfy  the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6 because she cannot  show that the parties “stipulate[d], in a writing signed by the parties outside  of the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of the  case . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6,  subd. (a).)  The email exchanges on which Johnson-Bokelberg alternately appears to rely make it clear  that the settlement was conditioned on approval by the Claims Committee.  A  motion for sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure  section 128.5 must be “made separately from other motions or requests . . .  .”  (Code Civ.  Proc., § 128.5, subd. (f)(1)(A).)  In  addition, “[i]f the alleged action or tactic is the making or opposing of a  written motion . . . that can be withdrawn or appropriately corrected, a notice  of motion shall be served as provided in Section 1010, but shall not be filed  with or presented to the court, unless 21 days after service of the motion or  any other period as the court may prescribe, the challenged action or tactic is  not withdrawn or appropriately corrected.”  (Code Civ.  Proc., § 128.5, subd. (f)(1)(B).)  LACMTA  has not complied with these prerequisites to the Court’s consideration of a  sanctions motion under Code of Civil  Procedure section 128.5.  Therefore, the  Court denies LACMTA’s request for sanctions.  CONCLUSION  The  Court DENIES Plaintiff Jill Johnson-Bokelberg’s motion to enforce settlement.  The  Court DENIES Plaintiff Jill Johnson-Bokelberg’s request for sanctions.  The  Court DENIES Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation  Authority’s request for sanctions.  Moving  party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
