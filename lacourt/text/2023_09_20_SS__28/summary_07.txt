And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The plaintiffs, Michael Fullerton and Brenda Severns, have filed motions to deem admitted the truth of matters specified in their requests for admissions, set two and three, served on the defendants, Licea Logistics, Inc. and John Vela. The defendants failed to respond to the requests for admission, and the plaintiffs are seeking sanctions.

The court grants the motions and deems admitted the matters specified in the requests for admission. The court also awards sanctions of $435 on each motion to the plaintiffs. The court orders the defendants and their counsel to pay the plaintiffs $435 in sanctions by October 20, 2023.

The court notes that the defendants failed to serve a timely response to the requests for admission and did not provide a proposed response before the hearing on the motion. The court finds that the defendants' failure to serve a timely response was not due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and therefore, the court must impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
