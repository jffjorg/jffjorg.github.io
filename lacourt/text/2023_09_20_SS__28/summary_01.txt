And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Johnson-Bokelberg's motion to enforce a settlement agreement with LACMTA, which requires LACMTA to pay Johnson-Bokelberg $74,147.67. The judge found that Johnson-Bokelberg has not proved the existence of a writing signed by the parties agreeing to settle the case, as required by California Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The judge also denied Johnson-Bokelberg's request for sanctions against LACMTA, as LACMTA did not comply with the prerequisites for filing a sanctions motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5. The judge also denied LACMTA's request for sanctions against Johnson-Bokelberg. The judge concluded that the parties did not agree on a deadline for payment of the settlement amount, and that the parties did not sign a writing agreeing to settle the case.
