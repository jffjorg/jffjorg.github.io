## English Summary:

The judge denied the plaintiff's motion to enforce a settlement agreement with the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) because the parties never signed a valid agreement.  

While the plaintiff presented a signed release form, the defendant LACMTA did not sign it.  Therefore, the court found the plaintiff could not meet the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, which governs settlement agreements.

The judge also denied both parties' requests for sanctions.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Jill Johnson-Bokelberg's motion to enforce a settlement agreement with Defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA). The parties allegedly entered into a written settlement agreement on June 29, 2022, which requires LACMTA to pay Johnson-Bokelberg $74,147.67. However, Johnson-Bokelberg has not provided evidence of a valid and binding settlement agreement, as LACMTA did not sign the release.
