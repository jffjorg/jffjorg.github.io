And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena for production of business records. The motion was filed by the defendants, who are seeking cellphone records for Sharol Batres' cellphone number (213)-800-3547 for the period of 04/17/2020-04/18/2020. The defendants argue that the records are necessary to determine liability and damages, and that the plaintiff has already provided his own cellphone records for the same time period. The plaintiff and cross-defendant argue that the subpoena is overly broad and seeks information that is not relevant to the case. The Judge has granted the motion, finding that the subpoenaed records are necessary to determine liability and damages, and that the plaintiff has failed to establish a legally protected privacy interest in the records.
