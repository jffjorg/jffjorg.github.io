Background
            On
January 11, 2024, Plaintiffs Virginia Rockwell (“Rockwell”) and Daniel McCallum
(“McCallum”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed the operative Second Amended
Complaint (“SAC”) against Defendants Robert M. Ladesich, as trustee for the
Ladesich Family Trust dated December 24, 1986, as restated and amended on July 13,
2007, Joseph Charles Ladesich, as trustee for the Ladesich Family Trust dated
December 24, 1986, as restated and amended on July 13, 2007, Jonathan Macht
(“Macht”), an individual residing in California, Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage
Company (“Coldwell Banker”), a California corporation, and DOES 1 through 10,
inclusive for (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Breach of Implied Covenant of Good
Faith and Fair Dealing; (3) Breach of Duties; (4) Tortious Interference; (5)
Fraudulent Intentional Misrepresentation; (6) Fraudulent Concealment; and (7)
Negligent Misrepresentation. 
            The
SAC alleges in pertinent parts as follows. The Ladesich Defendants granted
Plaintiffs the exclusive right to purchase the real property located on 725 Via
de la Paz, Pacific Palisades, CA 90272 (“Property”) under a Lease Agreement.
(SAC ¶¶11, 14.) About April 23, 2022, the Parties had reached mutually
acceptable terms for the sale of the Property from the Ladesich Defendants to
Plaintiffs for $3.8 million. (SAC ¶20.) The Ladesich Defendants entertained
competing offers during the exclusivity period and attempted to seek
$150,000.00 above asking price. (SAC ¶¶22-23.)
            On
August 1, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motions to Compel Ladesich
Defendants to provide Further Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One).
On September 9, 2024, Ladesich Defendants filed their oppositions. On September
13, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their reply briefs. 
            
Legal
Standard
Where answers to
requests for interrogatories have been served but requesting party believes
that they are deficient because the answers are evasive or incomplete or
because an objection is without merit, that party may move for an order
compelling a further response. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (a).) 
The motion must
be made within 45 days after service of the verified response or any
supplemental verified response. (Code Civ. Proc.,  § 2033.290, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.300, subd. (c).)
Finally, California
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345 requires that all motions or responses involving
further discovery contain a separate statement with the text of each request,
the response, and a statement of factual and legal reasons for compelling
further responses. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1345, subd. (a)(3)).¿
 
Meet and Confer 
The motion must
be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration in compliance with Code of Civil
Procedure Section 2016.040. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.290, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.300, subd. (b).)
Plaintiffs
advance the declaration of their counsel of record, Victor R. Balladares,
attesting to meet and confer made prior to the filing of the instant motions.
Attorney Balladares sent a meet and confer letter on April 9, 2024. (Balladares
Decl., ¶4, Ex. 3.) On June 13, 2024, Ladesich Defendants served supplemental
responses. (Id. at ¶5, Ex. 4.) The Parties engaged in further meet and
confer efforts on July 1-2, 2024, regarding Ladesich Defendants’ supplemental
responses. (Id. at ¶6, Ex. 5.) Ladesich Defendants’ counsel, Ms. Guzman
stated the supplemental responses were appropriate. 
Thus, Plaintiffs’
sufficiently met and conferred in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure
Section 2016.040. 
 
 
 
 
Discussion

Plaintiffs seek
further responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) Nos. 6, 7, 8, 11, 17,
18, 19, 21, 22, 29, 30, and 31 from Ladesich Defendants. Also, Plaintiffs seek
further responses to Special Interrogatory No. 12 from Defendant Robert
Ladesich.  These interrogatories seek
identification of documents evidencing communications between Plaintiffs and Ladesich
Defendants, identification of communications between Plaintiffs and Ladesich
Defendants, description of how Ladesich Defendants came to the decision to sell
the Property, identification of documents evidencing persons who have
information regarding the decision to sell the Property for the $3.8 million,
and identification of documents evidencing the new information that Ladesich
Defendants relied on in increasing the purchase price by $150,000.00. 
In opposition,
Ladesich Defendants assert they have separately served a second set of further
responses to the interrogatories at issue. In reply, Plaintiffs argue the
amended supplemental responses are also deficient. Nevertheless, the present
motions have been rendered moot as the responses at issue have been further
supplemented. To the extent Plaintiffs contend the newly amended responses are
deficient, they must file a new motion to compel further. 
 
Therefore, the
Motions to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) are
DENIED as moot. 
 
            It
is so ordered.
