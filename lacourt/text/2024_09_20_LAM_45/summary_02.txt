```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motions to compel further responses to special interrogatories, finding that the motions are moot because the defendants have already provided further responses to the interrogatories at issue. The judge notes that the plaintiffs had previously sought further responses to special interrogatories, but that the defendants had argued that they had already provided sufficient responses. The judge finds that the parties had engaged in meet and confer efforts prior to the filing of the motions, but that the motions were still denied as moot. The judge orders that the motions be denied and that the plaintiffs must file a new motion to compel further if they are dissatisfied with the newly amended responses.
