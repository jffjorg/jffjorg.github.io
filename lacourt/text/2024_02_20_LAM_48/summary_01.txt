Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to bifurcate the issues relating to punitive damages. The court has ordered that the trial of punitive damages will be separate from the trial of actual damages. The defendants are required to cooperate in making available records to establish their ability to pay punitive damages if a finding of liability is made. The plaintiff has filed a conditional non-opposition to the motion, requesting that the defendants cooperate in making available records if a finding of liability is made. The court has noted that bifurcation is mandatory under these circumstances.
