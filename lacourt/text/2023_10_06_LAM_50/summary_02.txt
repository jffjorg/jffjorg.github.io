And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the Plaintiff's assertion that Exquisite Apparel failed to produce documents. The Court notes that Exquisite Apparel's counsel had requested an extension to provide responses and documents, which was granted by the Plaintiff. The counsel then served the responses and documents on January 23, 2022, and indicated that they were still waiting on verifications. However, Exquisite Apparel does not oppose the instant motion and has not provided evidence that verifications were served. The remaining issue is Exquisite Apparel's failure to provide verifications, which the Court will consider at the next hearing.
