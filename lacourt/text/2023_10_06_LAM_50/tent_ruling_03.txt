AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



            
Background 
On June 8, 2022, Plaintiffs Eugene Chorny (“Chorny”)
and Irina Ermakova (jointly, Plaintiffs”) filed the instant action against
Defendants Samuel Ohana (“Ohana”), Tamim, LLC (“Tamim”), The Barbara Willa
Johanna Katt Living Trust (the “Trust”), and Marks and Associates, a
California Accountancy Corporation (collectively,
“Defendants”).

On February 14, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the operative Second Amended
Complaint (“SAC”) in this action, alleging causes of action for (1) breach of covenant of good faith and
fair dealing, (2) fraud, (3)
cancellation of title, and (4) intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. 
On April 19, 2023, Ohana and Tamim (jointly, the “Ohana Defendants”)
filed a Cross-Complaint against Plaintiffs and the Trust, alleging causes of
action for (1) fraud, (2) negligent misrepresentation, (3) indemnity, (4)
contribution, and (5) declaratory relief.
On September 13, 2022, Tamim filed an Unlawful Detainer Action against
Plaintiffs in the case Tamim, LLC v. Eugene Chorny, et al., Case No.
22VECV01348 (the “UD Action”). On October 17, 2022, the Court issued a minute
order in the instant action providing, inter alia, that “[t]he Court
finds that the following cases, 22STCV18736 and 22VECV01348, are related within
the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule
3.300(a). 22STCV18736 is the lead case.” 

On March 28, 2023, the Court issued an Order granting Plaintiffs’
motion to consolidate the instant action with the UD Action. The Court’s March
28, 2023 minute order in this action provides that “[t]he Court orders the
following cases, 22STCV18736 and 22VECV01348, consolidated and assigned to
Department 50 in Stanley Mosk Courthouse for all purposes. The Court designates
22STCV18736 as the lead case. All future documents must be filed under 22STCV18736
(EUGENE CHORNY, et al. vs SAMUEL OHANA, et al.). Case numbers on all subsequent
filings should be reflected under the lead case.” 
Tamim now moves for an order “severing/deconsolidating” the instant action and the UD Action, and
requests that the Court set the UD Action for trial. Plaintiffs oppose. 
Discussion 
Tamim asserts that good cause exists for the Court to
“sever/deconsolidate” the instant action and the UD action because Chorny “has
no further claims affecting title of the Subject Property.” (Mot. at p.
4:24-25.) Tamim notes that on April 12, 2023, the Court issued an order
sustaining the Ohana Defendants’ demurrer to the second, third, and fourth
causes of action of the SAC, without leave to amend. The Court’s April 12, 2023
Order also provides that “[t]he Court orders the Ohana Defendants to file their
answer to the SAC within 10 days of this Order. As set forth above, the first
cause of action of the SAC is alleged against all Defendants, and the Ohana
Defendants do not demur to this cause of action.” (April 12, 2023 Order at p.
16:17-19.) 
The Court also notes that its March 28, 2023 Order on Plaintiffs’
motion to consolidate provides, inter alia, that “[b]ased on a consideration of the arguments presented by the
parties, the Court finds it appropriate to consolidate the two actions. As
set forth above, ‘[w]hen
an unlawful detainer proceeding and an unlimited action concerning title to the
property are simultaneously pending, the trial court in which the
unlimited action is pending may stay the unlawful detainer action until
the issue of title is resolved in the unlimited action, or it may consolidate
the actions. If it does neither and instead
tries the issue of title under the summary procedures that constrain unlawful
detainer proceedings, the parties’ right to a full trial of the issue of title
may be unfairly expedited and limited.’ (Martin-Bragg v. Moore, supra, 219 Cal.App.4th at p. 385
[internal citation omitted].)” (March 28, 2023 Order at p. 9:4-12.)  
Tamim argues that “[i]nsofar
as Chorney’s [sic] cause of action in the Related Action for cancellation of
deed of trust was
dismissed without leave to amend, there is no basis or need for the Unlawful
Detainer Action and
Related Action to remain consolidated.” (Mot. at p. 5:13-15.)[1]
Tamim asserts that “no ‘actions involving a common question of law or fact are
pending before the court’ requiring further consolidation.” (Mot. at p.
5:16-17). Tamim cites to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1048, subdivision (a), which provides that “[w]hen actions
involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may
order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the
actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders
concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.”  
However, Tamim does not appear to cite to any
legal authority specifically supporting Tamim’s request that the Court
“sever/deconsolidate” the instant action and the UD Action. 
In addition, as set forth above, Plaintiff’ first cause of
action for breach of the
covenant of good faith and fair
dealing is still alleged against the Ohana Defendants. On April 18, 2023, the
Ohana Defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings as to Plaintiffs’
first cause of action in the instant case. The hearing on the Ohana Defendants’
motion for judgment on the pleadings is set for October 18, 2023. (See
August 18, 2023 Minute Order.) In the opposition to the instant motion,
Plaintiffs assert that “[i]t is not practicable and not in the interest
of judicial economy to grant the instant TAMIM’S Motion before the MJOP
is heard.” (Opp’n at p. 3:25-27, emphasis omitted.) Tamim did not file any
reply in support of the motion and thus does not dispute this point. 
Plaintiffs also contend that the instant motion is an untimely motion
for reconsideration. Plaintiffs cite to Code of
Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a), which provides that “[w]hen an
application for an order has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused
in whole or in part, or granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any
party affected by the order may, within 10 days after service upon the
party of written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different
facts, circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that
made the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order. The party making the application shall state by affidavit what
application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions
were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed
to be shown.” (Emphasis added.) 
As set forth above, the Court issued an
Order on April 12, 2023 sustaining the Ohana Defendants’ demurrer to the
second, third, and fourth causes of action of the SAC, without leave to amend.
Plaintiffs note that the instant motion was filed on September 5, 2023, well over
10 days after April 12, 2023. As discussed, Tamim did not file any reply
in support of the instant motion, and thus does not respond to Plaintiff’s
assertion that the instant motion is an untimely motion for reconsideration.
Further, as discussed, Tamim does not appear to cite
to any legal authority specifically supporting Tamim’s request that the Court
“sever/deconsolidate” the instant action and the UD Action.
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Tamim’s motion is denied.  
///
Plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of this Order.
