[1]As an initial matter, Defendant asserts that Plaintiffs’
opposition was filed and served late, and as such, should not be considered. The opposition was filed on September 26, 2023, 8
court days prior to the October 6, 2023 hearing date. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b),
opposition
papers must be served and filed with the court at least 9 court days before
the hearing. In addition,
the proof of service attached to the opposition states that the opposition was
served on September 24, 2023 via email, but Defendant asserts that as of
September 26, 2023, no opposition to the motion had been served. (Wagner Reply
Decl., ¶ 4.) Because Defendant has submitted a substantive reply brief, the Court elects to exercise its discretion to
consider the untimely opposition. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1300, subd. (d).)
