And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants in part and denies in part the plaintiff's motion for terminating and monetary sanctions against the defendant, Exquisite Apparel Corp. The plaintiff, Fredy Vera Corona, filed a complaint against the defendants, alleging violations of the Private Attorneys General Act. The court had previously issued several orders requiring Exquisite Apparel to comply with discovery requests, but the defendant failed to do so. The plaintiff moved for sanctions, which the court granted in part. The defendant failed to pay the sanctions, and the plaintiff moved for terminating and monetary sanctions again. The court found that the defendant's non-compliance with court orders was wilful and ordered the defendant to pay $3,421.65 in sanctions and struck the defendant's answer to the complaint.
