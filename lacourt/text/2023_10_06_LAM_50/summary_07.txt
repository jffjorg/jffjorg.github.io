And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer to the complaint filed by Dr. Shawn Roofian MD, an individual, dba Integrated Pain Management against Downtown LA Law, et al. The defendants demurred to each of the causes of action in the complaint, and the plaintiff opposes. The court notes that the defendants did not file a declaration demonstrating that they met and conferred with the plaintiff before filing the demurrer, as required by the court's previous order. As a result, the court is taking the demurrer off calendar and ordering the defendants to give notice of this order. The defendants are also required to file a declaration setting forth their efforts to meet and confer with the plaintiff in compliance with California Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a)(3).
