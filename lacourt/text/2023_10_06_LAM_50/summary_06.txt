And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the Defendant's assertion that the Plaintiff's opposition to the motion was filed and served late. The opposition was filed on September 26, 2023, which is 8 court days prior to the October 6, 2023 hearing date. According to Code of Civil Procedure section 1005, subdivision (b), opposition papers must be served and filed with the court at least 9 court days before the hearing date. The proof of service attached to the opposition states that it was served on September 24, 2023 via email. However, the Defendant asserts that as of September 26, 2023, no opposition had been served. Despite this, the Judge decides to exercise its discretion to consider the untimely opposition, citing California Rules of Court, rule 3.1300, subd. (d).
