English summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Rolf M. Treu in a medical malpractice case filed by Santiago Ramirez, a minor, and his Guardian ad Litem, Martha Ramirez Moreno, against CHA Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center and Arus Zograbyan, M.D. The complaint alleges causes of action for general negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Zograbyan demurred to the second cause of action, arguing that it is duplicative of the first cause of action, and CHA joined in the demurrer. The Court finds that Zograbyan has the better argument and sustains the demurrer, with leave to amend. The Court also grants CHA's joinder in the demurrer. The Court orders the plaintiffs to file and serve an amended complaint, if any, within 20 days of the date of this order. If no amended complaint is filed, the defendants are ordered to file and serve their answers within 30 days of the date of this order.
