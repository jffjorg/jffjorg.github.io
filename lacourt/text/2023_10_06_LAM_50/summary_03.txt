Significant Statements:
  - "When an unlawful detainer proceeding and an unlimited action concerning title to the property are simultaneously pending, the trial court in which the unlimited action is pending may stay the unlawful detainer action until the issue of title is resolved in the unlimited action, or it may consolidate the actions. If it does neither and instead tries the issue of title under the summary procedures that constrain unlawful detainer proceedings, the parties' right to a full trial of the issue of title may be unfairly expedited and limited." (Martin-Bragg v. Moore, supra, 219 Cal.App.4th at p. 385)
  - "Good cause exists for the Court to 'sever/deconsolidate' the instant action and the UD action because Chorny 'has no further claims affecting title of the Subject Property.'" (Mot. at p. 4:24-25)
  - "Insofar as Chorney's cause of action in the Related Action for cancellation of deed of trust was dismissed without leave to amend, there is no basis or need for the Unlawful Detainer Action and Related Action to remain consolidated." (Mot. at p. 5:13-15)

Summary:

The Judge, Hon. Rolf M. Treu, has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion filed by Tamim, LLC to sever and deconsolidate the instant action (Case No. 22STCV18736) and the Unlawful Detainer Action (Case No. 22VECV01348). The Court had previously consolidated the two actions on March 28, 2023. Tamim argues that since Chorny's cause of action for cancellation of deed of trust was dismissed without leave to amend, there is no basis for the Unlawful Detainer Action and Related Action to remain consolidated. The Court finds that Tamim has not provided legal authority to support its request and that the instant motion is an untimely motion for reconsideration. The Court also notes that the Ohana Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings as to Plaintiffs' first cause of action is still pending and that it is not practicable to grant the instant motion before the hearing on the Ohana Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings.
