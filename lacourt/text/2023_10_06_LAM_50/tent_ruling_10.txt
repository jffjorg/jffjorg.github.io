TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:  
 
MOTION TO COMPEL
  PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENT BY DEFENDANT’s PERSON MOST QUALIFIED MR. ANDREW
  KUSZYNSKI, AND REQUEST FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,935.00 
 
 



            
Background
Plaintiff Consumer
Advocacy Group, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed this Proposition 65 (“Prop 65”) action
on June 20, 2017 against a number of Defendants, including Gel Spice Company,
Inc. (“Gel Spice”). The operative Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) was filed on
January 19, 2021, alleging that various defendants exposed California consumers
to lead without Proposition 65 warnings through the manufacture and sale of
certain food products (spices). This action was later consolidated with Consumer
Advocacy Group, Inc. v. Viva Bargain Center, Inc. (Case No. 19STCV24048),
in which the chemicals at issue were lead and arsenic.   
On July 6, 2022 and October 18, 2022, Plaintiff served amended notices
of deposition of Gel Spice’s
Person Most Qualified. (Yeroushalmi Decl., ¶ 2, Ex. A.) Plaintiff
indicates that the deposition was held on October 20, 2022. (Yeroushalmi Decl.,
¶ 3.) Plaintiff’s counsel states that “[o]n October 21, 2022, [Plaintiff] sent
the Defendant a meet and confer letter regarding Defendant’s objection to [Plaintiff’s]
notice to produce documents at deposition.” (Yeroushalmi Decl., ¶ 4, Ex. B.)  Plaintiff’s counsel states that as of the date
of his November 4, 2022 declaration in support of the instant motion,
“Defendant has not provided documents in response to Plaintiff’s deposition
notice.” (Yeroushalmi Decl., ¶ 7.)
On January 9, 2023, the parties participated in an Informal Discovery Conference
(“IDC”). The Court’s January 9, 2023 minute order provides, inter
alia, that “[t]he
parties participated in an Informal Discovery Conference regarding the issues
set forth in the Plaintiff’s
short statement regarding Informal Discovery Conference January 4, 2023.
The parties reached
tentative agreements regarding the issues raised but if Motions to Compel
Further are necessary,
Plaintiff has until January 30, 2023 to file such motions.”[1] 
            On January 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed
a “Supplemental Declaration of Kenneth W. Ralidis in Support of Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Production of Document [sic] By Defendant’s Person Most
Qualified Mr. Andrew Kuszynski, and Request for Monetary Sanctions in the
Amount of $1,935.00.” In his supplemental declaration, Mr. Ralidis states that
at the January 9, 2023 IDC, Gel Spice “agreed to provide documents ‘for
attorneys eyes only’ as well as provide supplemental responses stating that
Defendant has undertaken a diligent search and do not have any underlying data
within Gel’s possession, custody or control.” (Suppl. Ralidis Decl., ¶ 4.) Mr.
Ralidis further states that “Defendant
had provided no such supplemental response apart from producing a two-page memorandum of a Proposition 65
assessment for Ground Cinnamon, Turmeric and Cumin,” and that as of the date of
the January 30, 2023 supplemental declaration, “Defendant has not provided all
documents in response to Plaintiff’s deposition notice and request for
documents.” (Suppl. Ralidis
Decl., ¶¶ 5-6.) 
Plaintiff moves for an order compelling Gel Spice to produce documents responsive to Plaintiff’s Notice of
Deposition dated October 18, 2022, document requests nos. 14, 20-1, 23-4, 32-3,
and 40. Plaintiff also seeks monetary sanctions. On September 7, 2023, Gel
Spice filed a “Declaration of Dennis Raglin Re: Plaintiff’s Moot Motion to
Compel Further Document Production.”  
Discussion
Plaintiff indicates that
the instant motion is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480. (Notice of Mot. at p. 2:10.) Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480, subdivision (a), “[i]f a
deponent fails to answer any question or to produce any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing under the deponent’s
control that is specified in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena, the
party seeking discovery may move the court for an order compelling that answer
or production.” Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.480, subdivision (b), “[t]his motion
shall be made no later than 60 days after the completion of the record of the
deposition, and shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration
under Section 2016.040.” 
As set forth above, Plaintiff moves for an
order compelling Gel Spice “to produce
documents responsive to Plaintiff’s Notice of Deposition dated October 18,
2022, document requests no. 14, 20-1, 23-4, 32-3, and 40.” (Notice of Mot.
at p. 2:5-7.) In the motion, Plaintiff references testimony from the October
20, 2022 deposition of Gel Spice’s PMQ, Mr. Kuszynski. 
Specifically, Plaintiff references the
following testimony: “Q…So what, in at least the 2017 time period, was Gel
Spice’s limits for the presence of lead so that it would release these spices
from its inventory to be processed? A. Okay. So after the turmeric recall for
turmeric, we enacted a limit of 1 PPM internally, and we sent that to our
suppliers, and we also sent that to internal testing, so we knew that any
incoming lot would be tested for that, and 1 PPM was the detection limits at
the time set forth across the industry, and we spoke and we determined some
things. We also started studying consumption-ratio studies and things like that
to help determine.” (Yeroushalmi Decl., ¶ 6, Ex. C (Kuszynski Depo.) at p. 151:13-152:1.)
Plaintiff also cites the following testimony: “Q. Do you have documents
reflecting that MADL study? A. I don’t personally have them, but I’m sure there’s
something.” (Id. at p. 160:4-7.) 
Plaintiff asserts in the
motion that “[t]he day after the deposition,
Plaintiff met and conferred with the Defendant on October 21, 2022 and
again thereafter on November 4, 2022 seeking identity of this particular
document which Defendant blatantly refused to provide under the garb of
objections.” (Mot. at p. 7:11-14.) 
As an initial matter, Gel
Spice asserts that the instant motion is moot. Gel Spice’s counsel asserts in
his declaration that “Plaintiff
glosses over the fact that
this issue was
resolved at the January 9, 2023 Informal Discovery Conference (IDC), and further responses were served. All issues set out in the
motion, filed in November of 2022, have been
answered, and supplemental documents were served by Gel Spice on Plaintiff on
January 10, 2023.” (Raglin Decl., ¶ 9.) Gel Spice’s
counsel further states that “Olam” purchased Gel Spice, and that “[a]fter the deposition, and
after discussing with the witness and the
new team at Olam, another search was made in all places any such Gel Spice
documents that still existed after the
merger could be, and a two-page document that was an analysis of spice levels and consumption data from Gel Spice’s former counsel
and its on-staff scientist was
located, and I
produced it in January of 2023. This is the document the witness was talking
about. It is the only document that was found…” (Raglin Decl., ¶ 10.) Gel Spice’s counsel states that “I told Plaintiff’s counsel that
it was all that could be located after a diligent search. Plaintiff’s counsel claimed I was not telling the truth, and
that the company was lying.
Plaintiff’s ‘Supplemental
Statement’ followed in January of 2023…” (Raglin Decl., ¶ 10.)
In its response filed on
September 29, 2023, Plaintiff asserts that “[t]he supplemental responses served
by Defendant to CAG’s Motion relating to the PMQ deposition did not render
CAG’s motion moot because the document was not responsive to what CAG
requested.” (Plaintiff’s Response at p. 3:28-4:2.) But Plaintiff acknowledges
that supplemental responses were served. As discussed, Plaintiff moves for an
order compelling Gel
Spice to produce documents responsive to Plaintiff’s Notice of Deposition dated
October 18, 2022, document requests nos. 14, 20-1, 23-4, 32-3, and 40. Gel Spice provides evidence that after the instant motion
was filed (on November 9, 2022), “supplemental documents were served by Gel Spice on Plaintiff on
January 10, 2023.” (Raglin Decl., ¶ 9.) As discussed, Gel Spice’s counsel
states that “a two-page document that was an analysis of spice levels and
consumption data from Gel Spice’s former counsel and its on-staff scientist was
located, and I produced it in January of 2023. This is the document the witness
was talking about. It is the only document that was found, and Olam voluntarily
waived privilege in producing it. I told Plaintiff’s counsel that it was all
that could be located after a diligent search…” (Raglin Decl., ¶ 10.) Thus, the
Court agrees with Gel Spice that the instant motion is moot. 
Lastly, both parties
seek sanctions. Plaintiff cites to Clement v. Alegre (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1286-1287, where the Court
of Appeal noted that “[w]henever one party’s improper actions—even if not
‘willful’—in seeking or resisting discovery necessitate the court’s
intervention in a dispute, the losing party presumptively should pay a sanction
to the prevailing party…” The court does not
find that Plaintiff has demonstrated that Gel Spice took any improper actions
in “resisting discovery.” Thus, the Court declines to award sanctions to
Plaintiff. In addition, although Gel Spice seeks monetary sanctions (Raglin
Decl., ¶ 14), Gel Spice does not cite to any legal authority in support of such
request. Thus, the Court also denies Gel Spice’s request for sanctions. 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing,
Plaintiff’s motion is denied as moot. The parties’ requests for sanctions are
denied. 
The Court orders Gel Spice
to give notice of this ruling.
