TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:
 
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR TERMINATING AND MONETARY SANCTIONS AGAINST DEFENDANT
  EXQUISITE APPAREL CORP.



            
 
Background 
On
January 20, 2021, Plaintiff Fredy Vera Corona (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Exquisite Apparel Corp. (“Exquisite Apparel”) and Affluent
Staffing, LLC (“Affluent Staffing”) (jointly, “Defendants”). On March 16, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended Representative Action Complaint
(the “SAC”), which contains a single cause of action for violation of the
Private Attorneys General Act.
On
December 1, 2021, the Court issued an Order granting four motions to compel
brought by Plaintiff. The Court’s December 1, 2021 Order provides, inter
alia, that:
 
“The Court orders Exquisite Apparel to serve complete
verified responses, without objections, to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories
Set One, and Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and to produce
responsive documents to the Requests for Production of Documents, Set One,
within 30 days of notice of this order…The Court further orders Exquisite
Apparel and Affluent Staffing to each pay $1,605.80 to Plaintiff within 30 days
of notice of this order.”
 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel asserts that as of the date of his August 8, 2023 declaration in
support
of the instant motion, “Defendant has failed to pay sanctions” or “serve verified responses…in
response to Plaintiff’s SROG and RFP in violation of the December 1, 2021
Order.” (Alami Decl., ¶ 14.) 
Plaintiff previously
moved for an order compelling Exquisite Apparel to comply
with the Court’s December 1, 2021 Order, and for terminating, issue, evidence, and monetary sanctions against
Exquisite
Apparel. On October
6, 2022, the Court issued an Order providing, inter alia, that “Plaintiff’s
motion against Exquisite Apparel is granted in part and denied in part. The
Court grants Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions and orders Exquisite
Apparel to pay $6,431.65 to Plaintiff within 30 days of notice of this Order.
Plaintiff’s motion for sanctions against Exquisite Apparel is otherwise denied.” 
Plaintiff then filed another motion “for
an order seeking terminating, issue, evidentiary, and/or monetary sanctions
against Defendant Exquisite Apparel Corp…for its failure to comply with (1) the
Court’s December 1, 2021 Order Granting Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses
to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production, Set One…and Special Interrogatories,
Set One…from Defendant and Request for Sanctions…and (2) the Court’s October 6,
2022 Order granting Plaintiff additional sanctions against Defendant in the
amount of $6,431.65 for failing to comply with the Court’s December 1, 2021
Order.” (See June 1, 2023 Order.) 
On June 1, 2023, the Court issued an Order granting in part and
denying in part Plaintiff’s motion pertaining to Exquisite Apparel. The Court’s
June 1, 2023 Order provides, inter alia, that “Plaintiff’s
motion for terminating sanctions and evidentiary sanctions against Exquisite
Apparel is denied. Plaintiff’s motion for issue sanctions against Exquisite
Apparel is granted. Plaintiff’s motion for monetary sanctions against Exquisite
Apparel is granted in part. Exquisite Apparel is ordered to pay monetary
sanctions in the amount of $5,371.65 to Plaintiff within 30 days of the date of
this Order.” 
Plaintiff’s
counsel indicates that on June 13, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendants with
notice of the Court’s June 1, 2023 ruling. (Alami Decl., ¶ 45, Ex. J.)
Plaintiff indicates that 
“Defendant failed to pay [the] sanctions
in violation of the Court’s June 1, 2023 Order.” (Alami Decl., ¶ 27.) 
Plaintiff now moves for an order
imposing terminating and monetary sanctions against Exquisite Apparel. No
opposition to the motion was filed. 
Discussion 
Disobeying a court
order to provide discovery is a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (g).) There are a broad range of
sanctions available against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the
discovery process, including the issuance of monetary, issue, evidentiary, and
terminating sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.)  
A
monetary sanction may be imposed against one engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).)  In addition, “[t]o the extent authorized by the chapter
governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of this title,
the court, after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after
opportunity for hearing, may impose the following sanctions against anyone
engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process:…(d) The court may
impose a terminating sanction by one of the following orders: (1) An order striking out the
pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process. (2) An order staying further proceedings by that party until an order
for discovery is obeyed. (3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that
party. (4) An order rendering a judgment
by default against that party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030,
subd. (d).)
                   
i.           
Terminating Sanctions 
Plaintiff
moves for terminating sanctions against Exquisite Apparel “for its failure to comply with (1) the
Court’s December 1, 2021 Order Granting Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Responses
to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production, Set One…and Special Interrogatories,
Set One…from Defendant and Request for Sanctions (the ‘December 1, 2021 Order’);
(2) the Court’s October 6, 2022 Order granting Plaintiff additional sanctions
against Defendant in the amount of $6,431.65 for failing to comply with the
Court’s December 1, 2021 Order; and (3) the Court’s June 1, 2023 Order granting
Plaintiff issue sanctions and additional monetary sanctions against Defendant
in the amount of $5,371.65 for failing to comply with the Court’s December 1,
2021 and October 6, 2022 Orders.” (Notice of Motion at p. 2:5-13.) 
The Court finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated that the imposition of terminating sanctions against Exquisite
Apparel is warranted here. As set forth above, the Court’s December 1, 2021 Order provides, inter alia,
that: “[t]he Court orders Exquisite Apparel to serve complete verified
responses, without objections, to Plaintiff’s Special Interrogatories Set One,
and Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, and to produce responsive
documents to the Requests for Production of Documents, Set One, within 30 days
of notice of this order…The Court further orders Exquisite Apparel and Affluent
Staffing to each pay $1,605.80 to Plaintiff within 30 days of notice of this
order.” Plaintiff’s
counsel states that “[t]o
date, Defendant has failed to pay sanctions [or] serve verified responses…in
response to Plaintiff’s SROG and RFP in violation of the December 1, 2021
Order.” (Alami Decl., ¶ 14.)[1]
In addition, as set forth above, on October 6, 2022, the
Court issued an Order granting Plaintiff’s request for monetary sanctions
against Exquisite Apparel, and ordered Exquisite Apparel to pay $6,431.65 to
Plaintiff. The Court’s October 6, 2022 Order provides that “the Court finds
that monetary sanctions are warranted for Exquisite Apparel’s failure to comply
with the December 1, 2021 Order. Exquisite Apparel did not oppose the instant motion
and has not provided evidence that it served verifications as required by the
Order.” (October 6, 2022 Order at p. 6:13-16.) Plaintiff indicates in the
instant motion that “Defendant
failed to pay these sanctions in violation of the Court’s October 6, 2022 Order.”
(Alami Decl., ¶ 19.) 
Further, as dicussed above, on June 1, 2023, the Court issued an Order
providing, inter alia, that “Plaintiff’s motion for issue sanctions
against Exquisite Apparel is granted. Plaintiff’s motion for monetary sanctions
against Exquisite Apparel is granted in part. Exquisite Apparel is ordered
to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $5,371.65 to Plaintiff within 30
days of the date of this Order.” (June 1, 2023 Order at p. 9:12-15.) The
Court’s June 1, 2023 Order notes that “[a]s discussed in the Court’s May 4, 2023 Order, Plaintiff provides evidence that Exquisite Apparel
failed to provide verifications in accordance with the Court’s December 1, 2021
Order.” (June 1, 2023 Order at p. 8:25-26.) The Court also found that
“Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause for the requested issue sanctions.” (Id. at p. 8:18.) In the instant motion,
Plaintiff indicates that “Defendant
failed to pay [the] sanctions in violation of the Court’s June 1, 2023 Order.”
(Alami Decl., ¶ 27.) 
As set forth
above, Exquisite Apparel did not oppose the instant motion. The Court does not
find that the circumstances demonstrate that a less severe sanction
would produce compliance with the discovery rules. 
Plaintiff seeks “[a]n order issuing a terminating sanction striking Defendant’s Answer
to Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint in its entirety, and rendering a
judgment by default against
Defendant
with prejudice.” (Notice of Motion at p. 2:16-18.) As
set forth above, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.030, subdivision (d), “[t]he court may impose a terminating sanction by one of the
following orders: (1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of
the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process. (2) An order
staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery is
obeyed. (3) An order
dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party. (4) An order
rendering a judgment by default against that party.” (Emphasis added.) However,
it appears that Plaintiff seeks two of the foregoing orders. Thus, the Court only
grants Plaintiff’s first request that the Court issue a “terminating sanction striking
Defendant’s Answer to Plaintiff’s First Amended
Complaint in its entirety.” (Notice of Motion at p. 2:16-17.) The Court notes
that on April 26, 2021, Plaintiff filed a “First Amended Representative Action
Complaint,” and on July 26, 2021, Exquisite Apparel filed an “Answer to
Plaintiff’s Complaint.” 
                 
ii.           
Monetary Sanctions 
As discussed,
Plaintiff’s counsel states that to date, Exquisite Apparel has failed to serve
verified responses in accordance with the Court’s December 1, 2021 Order. (Alami
Decl., ¶ 14.) As discussed, Exquisite Apparel
did not oppose the instant motion and thus does not provide evidence that it
served verifications as required by the Order. 
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subdivision
(a), “[t]he
court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay
the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a
result of that conduct…” 
Plaintiff
requests that the Court award monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,506.65. (Alami Decl., ¶¶ 32-35.) Plaintiff’s
counsel states that he “spent a
minimum of 6.50 hours drafting this declaration, revising and finalizing the notice
of motion, memorandum, declarations, and proposed order; researching discovery
issues and sanctions; reviewing and finalizing the
exhibits; conferring with my co-counsel Daniel J. Hyun; and filing
the Motion and accompanying documents,” and further states that “[t]he total
reasonable attorneys’ fees for this minimum of 6.5 hours of time is therefore
$3,250.00.” (Alami Decl., ¶¶ 32, 34.) The Court deducts $85 in fees, as Plaintiff sought certain
fees in connection with filing a reply. (Alami Decl., ¶ 35.) Thus, the Court finds that sanctions in the
total amount of $3,421.65 is reasonable. 
Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion is granted in part and denied in part. 
Plaintiff’s
motion for an order “issuing
a terminating sanction striking Defendant’s Answer to Plaintiff’s First Amended
Complaint in its entirety” is granted. The Court strikes Exquisite Apparel’s
answer filed on July 26, 2021. 
Plaintiff’s
motion for monetary sanctions against Exquisite Apparel is granted in part. 
Exquisite Apparel is ordered to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,421.65 to Plaintiff within 30 days of the date of this Order. 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this Order.
