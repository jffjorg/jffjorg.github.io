[1]As to Plaintiff’s
assertion that Exquisite Apparel failed to produce documents (Alami Decl., ¶
14), the Court notes that the Court’s May 4, 2023 Order provides, “‘Plaintiff provides evidence that
Exquisite Apparel’s counsel requested an extension to January 23, 2022 to provided
responses and documents, which request was granted by Plaintiff…Exquisite
Apparel’s counsel then served the responses and documents on January 23, 2022,
and indicated that he was still waiting on verifications but anticipated having
them shortly…’ (October 6, 2022 Order at p. 6:2-6.) Thus, it appears that the
remaining issue is Exquisite Apparel’s failure to provide verifications. As
discussed, Exquisite Apparel does not oppose the instant motion or provide
evidence that verifications were served.” (May 4, 2023 Order at p. 9:19-26.)
