And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Heriberto Plascencia to the claims of harassment and intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) brought by Plaintiff Maynor Galindo. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the allegations in the complaint state a cause of action. The judge notes that while some of the alleged conduct may be trivial, other allegations, such as the use of curse words, requiring lunch deliveries, and speaking in a menacing manner, may constitute harassment. The judge orders discovery to explore these allegations further. The defendant is ordered to file an answer to the complaint within 20 days.
