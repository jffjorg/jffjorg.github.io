And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the Petition to Approve Minor's Compromise in part. The proposed settlement of $25,000 between the minor, Dawnielle Desensi, and the defendants, 3J1M LLC, Ironwood Velvet LLC, and Aperto Property Management Inc., is generally fair and reasonable. However, the judge reduces the attorneys' fees requested by the minor's attorney from 40% of the settlement sum to 32% or $8,000. The court finds that the 40% fee request is not reasonable and must be evaluated using a reasonable fee standard under Cal Rules of Court, Rule 7.955. The court grants the petition in part and orders the parties to file amended proposed orders within 10 days.
