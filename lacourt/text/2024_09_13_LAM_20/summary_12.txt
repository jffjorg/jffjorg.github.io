And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in this case, in which Plaintiff Latoya S. Redd claims that Defendants failed to pay her $35,489.51 attorneys' fee lien with settlement funds from case number YC072873. The Defendants, Thomas Kovich and William R. Johnson, have moved to set aside their defaults, and the Judge has granted this motion. The Judge has also denied Plaintiff's motion to lift the stay of discovery, as Plaintiff has failed to show good cause to conduct discovery.

In reaching this decision, the Judge considered the discretionary provision of Code Civ. Proc. § 473(b), which allows the court to relieve a party from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against them through their mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. The Judge found that the Defendants had shown excusable neglect in failing to respond to the Complaint in a timely manner, and therefore granted their motion to set aside their defaults.

The Judge also considered the anti-SLAPP motion filed by Defendant Tyson & Mendes, LLP, and denied Plaintiff's motion to lift the stay of discovery. The Judge found that Plaintiff had failed to show good cause to conduct discovery, as Plaintiff should have sufficient evidence in her possession to defend her tort claims. The Judge encouraged counsel to submit on the tentative ruling and to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
