And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendants' motions to compel further responses to discovery requests will be granted if the requested discovery responses have not been provided by the time of the hearing. If the responses have been provided, the motions will be mooted. The judge is inclined to grant the motions to compel and to continue the deemed admissions motion pending the provision of verified responses. The judge also continues the hearing on the issue of sanctions to allow counsel to negotiate a reasonable figure or for the court to decide once the verified responses are in hand.
