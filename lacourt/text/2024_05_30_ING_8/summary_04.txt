And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to compel arbitration in the case of Steven Barker v. Geico General Insurance Company. The judge has denied Barker's argument that he is able to choose any arbitrator. The court finds that the parties agreed to abide by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) rules, which include the selection of a AAA arbitrator from the AAA National Roster. As an alternative, the court will select a recently retired Superior Court judge from a local private judging facility, such as Steven Kleifield at ADR Services, Inc. The court notes that Geico's language is not a model of clarity, but finds that the intent of the parties was that if the parties could not agree on an arbitrator, then AAA would appoint one from its national roster.
