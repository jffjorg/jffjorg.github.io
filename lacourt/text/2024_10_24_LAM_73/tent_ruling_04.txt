PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES
AND COSTS (filed on 09/12/2024)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion for Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED. The Court awards Plaintiff
$47,899.94
in attorney fees and
costs. 
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On July 17, 2023, Plaintiff John Puncer brought this action
against Defendant General Motors, LLC. 
 
Plaintiff asserts causes of action for: (1) Breach of Implied
Warranty of Merchantability under The Song-Beverly Act; and (2) Breach of
Express Warranty under The Song-Beverly Act.
 
This action stems from Plaintiff’s purchase of a 2022 Chevrolet Silverado,
VIN 1GCPACEDINZ615314 (“Subject Vehicle” or Vehicle”), on November 19, 2022.
The Vehicle was manufactured and warranted by Defendant. Plaintiff alleges that
after persistent manufacturing defects, Plaintiff brought the vehicle in for
repairs to Defendant’s authorized dealership(s) who were unable to repair the
defects. Thus, Plaintiff’s lawsuit alleges breach of express and implied
warranties under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.
 
On September 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for
attorneys’ fees, arguing:
·      
Plaintiff is entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees
and costs pursuant to the Offer to Compromise and The Song-Beverly Consumer
Warranty Act (Civil Code § 1794(d)
·      
As the prevailing party, Plaintiff respectfully move this Court
for an award of attorneys' fees in the amount of $39,307.50. Plaintiff requests a 0.25 multiplier in the amount of $9,826.87.
Plaintiff incurred costs and expenses totaling $8,592.44. In total, Plaintiff
requests an award of fees and costs in the amount of $57,726.81.
 
Defendants filed an opposition, arguing: 
·      
Plaintiff’s counsel seeks an unreasonable award. Counsel
overbilled and used litigation templates.
o  
GM is challenging Counsel’s alleged hours because the record,
including Counsel’s own time records and its actual work product, does not
support that the time “billed” was either actually or reasonably incurred.
·      
The case does not warrant a multiplier
o  
Counsel has not satisfied the three elements to support any
enhancement under California law: (1) the novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved and the skill displayed in presenting them; (2) the extent
to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys; and (3) the contingent nature of the fee award, based on the
uncertainty of prevailing on the merits and of establishing eligibility for the
award. (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel Trailers of California, Inc. 144
Cal.App.4th 785, 819). 
·      
Counsel’s costs are not compensable.
·      
Counsel’s rate should be lowered to their 2023 rates.  
·      
Counsel should be awarded no more than $8,357.50 (representing
14.4 hours) in fees and $1,25252 in costs, for a total of award not to exceed
$9,610.02 against GM
 
Plaintiff filed a reply, arguing: 
·      
The Court should disregard Defendant’s oversized opposition as a late
filed opposition 
·      
Plaintiff’s request for positive multiplier is reasonable given
GM’s additional four month delay in resolving this case. Further, The Broad
Consumer Protection Aims of The Song-Beverly Act, Inherent Public Policy
Interest Accomplished by the Litigation of Plaintiff's Case, and Outcomes
Achieved Warrant A Lodestar Enhancement
·      
GM's Counsel Lumps Together Numerous Pages of Plaintiff’s Exhibit
"4" and Double Dips Time Entries to Achieve The Appearance of
Overbilling
·      
Plaintiff maintains that the requested fees/costs are reasonable. 
·      
Any Challenge by GM to the Fees Incurred by TBLF Must be Provided
With Specific Objections to the Challenged Entries and Not Just the Opinion of
Opposing Counsel About How Long an Activity "Should" Take.
·      
Defendant GM has not produced rebuttable evidence
·      
GM' s argument that Plaintiffs should not recover fees incurred
for any work that involved the use of a template should be rejected
o  
GM presents no evidence, or cites to any legal authority, to
support such a contention.
 
II. ANALYSIS
 

A.     Procedural
Deficiencies with Defendant’s Opposition
 
First, Plaintiff argues that the Court should disregard
Defendant’s oversized opposition and consider it as an untimely motion. (Cal.
Rules of Court, Rules 3.1113(g), 3.1300(d).)
 
Plaintiff argues Defendant’s opposition exceeds 15 pages long
because there are sections of the opposition that include single-spaced text
and the opposition contains reduced margins that allow Defendant to include
more text. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.108).) Memorandums that exceed their
respective page limits are deemed late. (Id., rule 3.1113, subd. (g).)
 
Nevertheless, the Court exercises its discretion to consider
the opposition. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300, subd. (d); Juarez v.
Wash Depot Holdings, Inc. (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 1197, 1202.) 
 
B.     Objections to
Evidence
 
Plaintiff’s objections
nos. 1-21 to Defendant’s evidence are overruled. 
 
C.     Legal
Standard 
 
If the buyer prevails in an action under [the Song-Beverly
Act], the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the
judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including
attorney's fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have
been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and
prosecution of such action. (Civ. Code, §1794, subd. (d).) 
 
The prevailing party has the burden of showing that the
requested attorney fees are reasonable. (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel
Trailers of California, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 817-818 (Robertson).)
The party seeking attorney fees “is not necessarily entitled to compensation
for the value of attorney services according to [his] own notion or to the full
extent claimed by [him].” (Levy v. Toyota Motor Sales, USA, Inc. (1992)
4 Cal.App.4th 807, 816, brackets in original and internal citations omitted.)
“’A trial court may not rubber stamp a request for attorney fees, but must
determine the number of hours reasonably expended.’ [Citation.]” (Morris v.
Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 38.) 
 
The lodestar approach is the prevailing method for
calculating attorney fees under Song-Beverly Act claims. (Robertson, supra, 144
Cal.App.4th at pp. 818-819.) “The reasonableness of attorney fees is within the
discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration of such
factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the
experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved.
[Citation.] The court may also consider whether the amount requested is based
upon unnecessary or duplicative work. [Citation.]” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan
(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.) “The courts repeatedly have stated that the
trial court is in the best position to value the services rendered by the
attorneys in his or her courtroom [citation], and this includes the
determination of the hourly rate that will be used in the lodestar
calculus.[Citation.]” (569 E. Cnty. Boulevard LLC v. Backcountry Against the
Dump, Inc. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 426, 436–437.) 
 
D.    
Plaintiff is entitled to recover
attorney’s fees
 
Here, the
parties do not dispute that Plaintiff is entitled to recover attorneys’ fees. On
July 11, 2024, the parties entered into an Offer to Compromise. (Barry Decl.,
Ex. 3.) The Offer to Compromise provides that Plaintiff may move for an award
of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to California Civil Code§
1794(d) and that Defendant agrees Plaintiff is the prevailing parties for the
purposes of this motion. Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff is entitled to
its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. 
 
E.    
Hourly Rate
 
“The
reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar
work.”  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “The
experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services
rendered in [her] court.” (Ibid.) An attorney’s
own billing rates carry a presumption of reasonableness. (Mandel v. Lackner
(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 747, 761.)
 
Plaintiff seeks to recover fees for four attorneys that billed time
in connection with this case. Their hourly rates are as follows: 
 
·       
David Barry:
$675/hour 
·       
Debora Rabieian: $500/hour 
·       
Brian Kim: $350/hour 
·       
C. Richard Lara: $350/hour 
 
Plaintiff’s
counsel states their hourly rate is well within the range of current market
rates in Los Angeles for attorneys of similar experience. (Barry Decl., ¶¶ 35-39.)
The Court finds that the rate
requested by Plaintiff’s counsel is reasonable. Defendant’s argument that counsel’s
hourly rate is unreasonably high is unpersuasive. Counsel’s
declaration sufficiently attests to their experience and the reasonableness of
the rates. (Barry Decl., ¶¶ 35-77.) Based on the evidence before it, the Court is not inclined to
reduce the hourly rates requested.
 
F.     
Reasonable Hours Incurred 
 
“A
trial court assessing attorney fees begins with a touchstone or lodestar
figure, based on the ‘careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable
hourly compensation of each attorney ... involved in the presentation of the
case.”  (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165
Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) “The reasonableness of attorney fees is within the
discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration of such
factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the
experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved. The court
may also consider whether the amount requested is based upon unnecessary or
duplicative work.” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443,
448.) 
 
While
not per se objectionable, block billing can exacerbate the vagueness of an
attorney fee request and support a court’s finding that time entries were
inflated and non-compensable.  (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor
(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1325-1326.) 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel states that they expended 100.2 hours
litigating this case. Defendant argues the time billed is not reasonable and
Plaintiff largely relied on templates. However, Defendant does not cite to any
authority in support of its assertion that the claimed hours should be reduced
based on the use of templates. The Court has considered the sought attorney fees based on
the stated tasks and does not find them unreasonable in light of the work
completed by counsel in this case. Further, verified cost bills are “prima
facie evidence the costs, expenses and services listed were necessarily
incurred…” (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682). In light
of the uncontroverted evidence in support and its own experience, the Court
finds the hourly rates and work billed by counsel reasonable. (See Morris v.
Hyundai Motor America (2019) 41 Cal.App.5th 24, 41, as modified
(Oct. 11, 2019), review denied (Jan. 2, 2020).) 
 
G.   
Multiplier
 
The Court is permitted, but not required, to
apply a multiplier to an award for attorney’s fees. (Ketchum v. Moses
(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1138.) Relevant factors to determine whether an
enhancement is appropriate include (1) the novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent
to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award. (Id. at 1132.) 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel seeks a lodestar enhancement of 0.25. The
Court does not find that Plaintiff
has shown that the case was particularly novel and complex. Though counsel
represented Plaintiff on a contingent basis and counsel argues that the outcome
of the case supports broader public policy interests, the Court declines to
increase fees by a 0.25 multiplier on these grounds. Since the Court does not
find a multiplier appropriate, counsel will be awarded the fees reasonably
incurred.
 
Accordingly, this Court grants Plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees for 100.2
hours of work, totaling $39,307.50.
 
H.   
Costs
 
Plaintiff also filed a Memorandum of Costs seeking the recovery of
its filing and service costs in connection with this matter. The “prevailing
party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or
proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd. (b).) While Defendant argues the
costs should be reduced, the Court finds the claimed costs were reasonably
incurred. Thus, the Court
further awards Plaintiff’s requested costs for $8,592.44.
 
In sum, this Court grants Plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees and costs
totaling $47,899.94.
 
III.
DISPOSITION 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion for
Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED. The Court awards Plaintiff $47,899.94 in attorney fees and costs.
