The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendants' motion to compel further responses to discovery requests. The judge denies the motion, finding that the defendants failed to meet and confer with the plaintiffs and failed to file a separate statement. The judge also grants the plaintiffs' request for monetary sanctions against the defendants in the amount of $1,807.26. This amount represents the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by the plaintiffs as a result of the defendants' misuse of the discovery process. The judge orders the defendants to pay the sanctions to the plaintiffs' counsel within 30 days.
