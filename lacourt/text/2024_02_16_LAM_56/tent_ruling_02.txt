  CASE NO.: 22STCV29999
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
MOTION TO QUASH SERVICE OF SUMMONS

Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 



 
MOVING
PARTY: Specially Appearing Defendant Robert T. Wang, M.D. (“Moving Defendant”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving papers.  No opposition papers were filed.  Any opposition papers were required to have
been filed and served at least nine court days before the hearing under
California Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision
(b).
 
BACKGROUND
            On September 14, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint (the “Complaint”)
alleging: (1) general negligence; (2) professional negligence; (3) wrongful
death; (4) elder abuse; and (5) violation of the Eighth Amendment 
 
 
On January 19, 2024, Moving Defendant filed a motion
to quash service of summons (the “Motion”) on the grounds that the Complaint
and summons were improperly served.
 
DISCUSSION
Under CCP section 418.10, subdivision (a), a defendant may
serve and file a notice of motion to quash service of summons on the ground of
lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.  (CCP § 418.10, subd. (a).)  Compliance with the statutory procedures for
service of process is essential to establish personal jurisdiction.  (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co.
(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1444.)  The filing of a proof of service
creates a rebuttable presumption that the service was proper but only if it
complies with the statutory requirements regarding such proofs.  (Id.
at 1441-42.)  When a defendant challenges the court’s personal
jurisdiction on the ground of improper service of process, the burden is on the
plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia, the
facts requisite to an effective service. 
(Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 403, 413.)
 
            Moving Defendant contends that the attempt at personal
service on December 21, 2023 was improper. 
(See Declaration of Robert T. Wang (“Wang Decl.”) ¶ 3.)  As it is unopposed, Plaintiff has not
satisfied the burden of demonstrating that service was proper.  The Court therefore GRANTS the Motion.  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
