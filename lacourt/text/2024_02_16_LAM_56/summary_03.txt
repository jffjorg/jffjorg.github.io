And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike certain allegations from the second amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs. The motion was filed by the defendant Dal-Tile Distribution, LLC, which argues that the allegations are not pled in accordance with the requirements of the case law, specifically Bockrath v. Adlrich Chemical Company, Inc. The judge has denied the motion as to one of the allegations, finding that the level of detail in the complaint is sufficient to meet the pleading requirements. However, the judge has granted the motion as to two other allegations, finding that the plaintiffs have conceded the point and have not argued against the motion's arguments regarding those allegations. The judge's ruling is subject to change pending further submissions from the parties.
