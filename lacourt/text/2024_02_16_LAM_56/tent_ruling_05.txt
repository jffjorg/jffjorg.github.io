The complaint in the 2021 Lawsuit alleges that “Plaintiff has received a Right
to Sue letter from the California Department of Fair Housing and Employment and
has thus exhausted all necessary administrative remedies.”  (Complaint in the 2021 Lawsuit, para.
9.)  The implication from this allegation
is that a right-to-sue letter was issued the DFEH before the 2021 Lawsuit was
filed on May 5, 2021.  No right-to-sue letter
was attached to any of the complaints in either the 2021 Lawsuit or the instant
lawsuit.
