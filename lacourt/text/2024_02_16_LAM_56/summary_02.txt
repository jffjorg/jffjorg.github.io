And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has considered the motion to quash service of summons filed by Robert T. Wang, M.D., one of the defendants, and has granted the motion. The Judge found that the plaintiff, Markella Thanou, failed to satisfy the burden of demonstrating that the service of summons was proper. The Judge noted that the defendant was served on December 21, 2023, and that the plaintiff did not file opposition papers to the motion. The Judge relied on California Code of Civil Procedure section 418.10 and case law to conclude that the service was improper and that the plaintiff has not established jurisdiction over the defendant. The Judge ordered the moving party to give notice of this ruling and instructed the parties who intend to submit on this tentative to send an email to the court as directed by the instructions provided on the court's website.
