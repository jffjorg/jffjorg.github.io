And here is the English text to summarize the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has considered the motions filed by the Plaintiff, including a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint and a motion to continue the trial date. The proposed second amended complaint adds a new cause of action alleging constructive eviction, but the Judge finds that the Plaintiff has not adequately explained why this amendment is necessary and proper. The Judge therefore denies the motion for leave to file the second amended complaint.

The Judge also considers the motion to continue the trial date, which is requested by the Plaintiff to allow for additional time to notice and conduct depositions. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has presented some grounds for a continuance, including the recent unavailability of Defendants' former employees. However, the Judge finds that the Plaintiff's explanation for the need for ongoing discovery is somewhat thin. The Judge therefore grants the motion to continue the trial date, but only to June 10, 2024, and vacates all pre-trial deadlines.
