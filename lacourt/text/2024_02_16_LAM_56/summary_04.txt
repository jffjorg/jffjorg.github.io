And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the demurrer filed by Defendant Life Steps Foundation, Inc. and has determined that the Plaintiff's complaint does not state a cause of action for discrimination in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). The judge has also sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action, which alleges that the Defendant failed to prevent discrimination, and the third cause of action, which alleges retaliation in violation of Labor Code section 1102.5. The judge has given the Plaintiff 20 days to amend these causes of action.

The judge has also ordered that if the Plaintiff chooses to amend the pleading, a copy of the referenced charge(s) and right-to-sue letter(s) from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) and the California Civil Rights Agency (CRA) both be attached to and incorporated into the amended pleading.

The judge has not made a final ruling on the matter and will consider any further submissions from the parties before making a final decision.
