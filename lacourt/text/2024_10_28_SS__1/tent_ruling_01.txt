TENTATIVE RULING
·       
Provide an updated declaration from the
administrator dated after the claim/response deadline of October 12, 2024. 
·       
There are apparently two objections from
Class Members Benjamin Wood and Ingrid Gutierrez. Counsel should file them with
the Court forthwith.
·       
Counsel for Plaintiff should submit a
declaration articulating the reasonableness of a class settlement where over
70% of the settlement funds are allocated for fees and costs. 
 
Upon the Court’s approval of the above items, the following order may
issue:
The Court hereby GRANTS
final approval and awards/approves the following: 
(1) $21,000 for attorney fees to Class Counsel, Oakwood Legal Group, LLP; (2) $10,944.85
for attorney costs to Class Counsel; (3) an enhancement payment of $2,500 to Plaintiff Justine Freeman; and (4) $30,000 for
settlement administration costs to CPT
Group. 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel shall also file an Amended Proposed
Order and Judgment, consistent with this ruling and containing the name of any class member who requested
exclusion. In addition, a paragraph should be added which sets forth the Gross
Settlement Amount, all deductions therefrom and the Net Settlement Amount
available for distribution to the class.  Further, remove language from the Proposed Order at ¶10 indicating that
Plaintiffs are ordered to dismiss their cases with prejudice. The Court
orders class counsel to file a final report summarizing all distributions made
pursuant to the approved settlement, supported by declaration. The Court will
set a non-appearance date for submission of a final report for October 28,
2025.
