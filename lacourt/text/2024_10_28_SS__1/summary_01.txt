The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Freeman v. Belcampo Group, Inc. The ruling addresses several issues related to the class settlement. The judge orders the settlement administrator to provide an updated declaration dated after the claim/response deadline of October 12, 2024. Additionally, the judge requires counsel for the plaintiff to submit a declaration articulating the reasonableness of the class settlement, as over 70% of the settlement funds are allocated for fees and costs. The judge also orders counsel to file objections from Class Members Benjamin Wood and Ingrid Gutierrez with the Court. If the above items are approved, the judge intends to grant final approval of the class settlement and award fees and costs to Class Counsel, as well as approve settlement administration costs. The judge also requires the plaintiff's counsel to file an amended proposed order and judgment, which includes the name of any class member who requested exclusion and a paragraph detailing the gross settlement amount, deductions, and net settlement amount available for distribution to the class.
