ANALYSIS
 
I.          Motion to Compel Initial 
            Plaintiff
Destynie Vanna moves for an order compelling Defendant Judy Bunma to serve
responses to the Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One.  
 
A.                                       
Legal Standard 
 
A party must respond to interrogatories and requests for
production of documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.260, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a).) If a party to
whom interrogatories or requests for production of documents are directed does
not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b);
Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (c).) The party also waives the right to
make any objections, including one based on privilege or work-product
protection. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.300, subd. (a).) No meet and confer efforts are required before filing a
motion to compel responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)
 
1.                 
Merits
 
As an initial matter, Plaintiff
includes statutes for a Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses, however, this
is a Motion to Compel Initial. 
 
Plaintiff brings
this Motion to Compel Response to Request for Production of Documents, Set One,
purportedly served on September 1, 2023. 
However, Plaintiff’s Exhibits “A”, “B”, and “C” which are to show that Plaintiff
served defendant the Request for Production of Documents, Set One, are the
incorrect documents.  Rather, Exhibits
“A”, “B”, and “C” pertain to Requests for Admission, which is not the discovery
dispute of the instant motion.  Also, the
Declaration of Attorney Bell refers to the Requests for Admission, which were
served on August 31, 2023, and attaches Requests for Admission, with
corresponding Proofs of Service, as Exhibits “B” and “C”.   Thus,
it is unclear whether Defendant was properly served with the Request for
Production of Documents. (On August 31, 2023, Plaintiff served Requests for
Admissions, Set One on Defendant Judy S. Bunma by mail. (Bell Decl. ¶ 2.)
 
In light of the evidence before the
Court, it is unclear whether Plaintiff was served with the Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, which is the subject of this motion.  Based thereon, the Court DENIES the
instant Motion without prejudice.  
 
2.                 
Sanctions
 
Plaintiff requests monetary
sanctions be awarded in the amount of $1,950.00 against Defendant and Defense
Counsel, jointly, and in favor of Plaintiff for misuse of discovery without
substantial justification. 
 
Since the Motion is DENIED without
prejudice, the Court finds that the request for sanctions is moot.  
 
III.       Conclusion 
 
            In all, the Court DENIES Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Defendant’s Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, without
prejudice. 
 
 The Court DENIES sanctions without
prejudice.  
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice and to attach a copy of the Court's Tentative
Ruling , as an exhibit to said notice, as the final order of the Court.
