English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion filed by Plaintiff Destynie Vanna to compel Defendant Judy Bunma to serve responses to the Plaintiff's Request for Production of Documents, Set One. The judge notes that the Plaintiff's exhibits are actually related to Requests for Admissions, not the Request for Production of Documents, which is the subject of the motion. The judge finds that it is unclear whether Defendant was properly served with the Request for Production of Documents, and therefore denies the motion without prejudice. The judge also denies the Plaintiff's request for sanctions without prejudice.
