English-text summary: The judge's tentative ruling grants Defendant Echo's motion for determination of good faith settlement under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6. The court finds that the agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant Echo to settle for $25,001.00 in exchange for a release and dismissal of Plaintiff's claims is a good faith settlement. The court considers the factors outlined in Tech-Bilt, including the rough approximation of Plaintiff's total recovery, the settlor's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, and the allocating of settlement proceeds among plaintiffs. The court finds that the settlement is reasonable and within the range of what a reasonable person would estimate as the settling defendant's liability.
