 Case Number:  22STCV15791    Hearing Date:   April 9, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Set Aside Default and Default Judgment filed by
Defendant Forum Entertainment, LLC.
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On May 11, 2022, Caroline Castaneda
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Forum Entertainment, LLC (“Defendant”),
The Kia Forum, and Does 1 through 50, for negligence and premises liability
causes of action arising from a slip and fall occurring on March 19, 2022. 
On August 29, 2022, default was entered
against Defendant.
On March 17,
2023, Defendant filed this motion to set aside and vacate default. That motion
was heard on May 17, 2023, and denied as untimely.
On October 6,
2023, Default Judgment was entered against Defendant.
On December 19,
2023, Defendant and Plaintiff jointly filed this motion to vacate the default
judgment entered against Defendant on October 6, 2023, and dismiss this action
in its entirety with prejudice.
Legal Standard
“ [A]s a general
rule, the parties should be entitled to a stipulated reversal to effectuate
settlement absent a showing of extraordinary circumstances that warrant an
exception to this general rule.” (Neary v. Regents of University of
California (1992) 3 Cal.4th 273, 276.) 
Code of Civil Procedure section 128,
subdivision (a), states: “Every court shall have the power to do all of the
following: … (8) To amend and control its process and
orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. An appellate court shall
not reverse or vacate a duly entered judgment upon an agreement or stipulation
of the parties unless the court finds both of the following: (A) There is no
reasonable possibility that the interests of nonparties or the public will be
adversely affected by the reversal. (B) The reasons of the parties for
requesting reversal outweigh the erosion of public trust that may result from
the nullification of a judgment and the risk that the availability of
stipulated reversal will reduce the incentive for pretrial settlement.”
Discussion
The parties have entered into a settlement
agreement.  (Lenkov Decl., ¶ 4; Caiafa
Decl., ¶ 4.)  As part of the settlement
agreement, the parties have agreed to seek to set aside the default judgment entered
against Defendant. (Lenkov Decl., ¶ 4; Caiafa Decl., ¶ 4.)
 
The Court has considered the arguments of counsel and the
evidence in the record.  The Court finds
that it has the power to set aside the judgment, that there are no extraordinary
circumstances present, and that setting aside the judgment would not have an
adverse effect on nonparties or the public. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(8); Neary
v. Regents of University of California (1992) 3 Cal.4th 273, 276.)
 
Accordingly, the
motion is GRANTED.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS the motion to set aside the judgment.
 
The Court SETS ASIDE the default judgment entered on
October 6, 2023.
 
The Court ORDERS that the entire action is DISMISSED WITH
PREJUDICE.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
