```

And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge grants the Plaintiffs' motion for trial preference, citing Code of Civil Procedure section 36, subdivision (b), which states that a civil action to recover damages for wrongful death or personal injury shall be entitled to preference upon the motion of any party to the action who is under 14 years of age unless the court finds that the party does not have a substantial interest in the case as a whole. The Plaintiffs, consisting of Sebastian I. Forbes, Lincoln Forbes, Joshua Chad Forbes, and Andrea Forbes, are under the age of 14, and have shown a substantial interest in the case. The Defendant City of South Pasadena argues that the Plaintiffs cannot obtain a preference under Code of Civil Procedure section 36, subdivision (e), but the Judge finds that the two subdivisions are alternative bases for a preference, not cumulative requirements. The trial date is currently set for June 25, 2024, and no adjustment to the trial date is made.
