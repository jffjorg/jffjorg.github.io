And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants AAA's motions to compel Plaintiff Susan Mizrahi and Plaintiff Amnon Mizrahi to respond to Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), and Requests for Production (Set One). The court also denies AAA's requests for sanctions. The court finds that AAA's motions to compel are justified because Plaintiffs failed to respond to the discovery requests served on November 30, 2023. The court grants the motions to compel because AAA need not show anything more. The court denies AAA's requests for sanctions because no opposition was filed to the motions to compel.
