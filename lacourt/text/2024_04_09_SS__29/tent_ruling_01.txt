  Case Number:  20STCV15518    Hearing Date:   April 9, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion for Deemed Admitted Order filed by Defendant Francisco
Jose Maisch.
 
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
This action arises from an automobile accident
that occurred on April 25, 2018, involving Plaintiff Brad Bello (“Plaintiff”)
and Defendant Francisco Jose Maisch (“Defendant”).  Plaintiff filed
the complaint in this action on April 23, 2020, against Defendant and Does 1
through 30, asserting one cause of action for motor vehicle
negligence.  Defendant filed his answer on November 19, 2021.
On April 28, 2023, the Court granted the motion
of Plaintiff’s counsel to be relieved. 
Since that time, Plaintiff has been representing himself.
On May 12, 2023, Defendant served Plaintiff with
Requests for Admission (Set One).  (Mittskus Decl., ¶ 4 & Exh.
A.)  Plaintiff was served by mail. 
(Ibid.)  Plaintiff did not
respond.  (Id., ¶¶ 6, 10.)
On February 22, 2024, Defendant filed this
motion.  Plaintiff was served by mail.
No opposition has been filed.
Legal
Standard
 
A party must
respond to requests for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.250, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed
does not provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an
order that … the truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for such a motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id.,
§ 2033.280; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).) 
The court “shall”
make the order that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed
admitted unless the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory
that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem
admitted the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil
Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a
party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)
Discussion
Defendant served Plaintiff with Requests for
Admission (Set One) on May 12, 2023.  (Mittskus Decl., ¶ 4 & Exh.
A.)  Plaintiff did not serve responses.  (Id., ¶¶ 6,
10.)
Defendant need not show anything more.  The request for a deemed-admitted order is GRANTED.
Defendant does not request monetary sanctions.
Conclusion
 
The Court GRANTS
Defendant’s Motion.
 
The Court ORDERS that Plaintiff is deemed to have
admitted the truth of the matters specified in Defendant’s Requests for
Admission (Set One).
 
Moving party is
ORDERED to give notice.
