Background
This case arises out of an accident that occurred on
November 10, 2021.  According to the
Complaint, Plaintiffs Amnon Mizrahi and Susan Mizrahi (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)
were injured when they were struck by their improperly secured vehicle after it
rolled off a flat bed tow truck. 
(Complaint, ¶¶ 10-23.)
On September 25, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the Complaint
in this action against Carmel Towing & Transport, Inc.; Bert’s Garage,
Inc.; Automobile Club of Southern California (“AAA”), and Does 1 through
25.  Plaintiffs assert causes of actions
for premises liability; negligence; vicarious liability; and loss of
consortium.  
AAA filed its Answer to the Complaint on October 17,
2023.
On November 30, 2023, AAA served discovery, including
Form Interrogatories (Set One) to each of the Plaintiffs; Special
Interrogatories (Set One) to each of the Plaintiffs; and Requests for
Production (Set One) to each of the Plaintiffs. 
(Harwood Decls., ¶ 3 & Exhs. A-B.) 
Plaintiffs did not respond to these discovery requests.  (Id., ¶ 5.)
On March 4, 2024, AAA filed these motions to compel.  AAA also seeks sanctions.
Plaintiffs have not filed any oppositions to any of these motions. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories
are directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290,
subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and
no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories,
“the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of documents
within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a
party to whom requests for production of documents are directed does not
provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling
response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time
limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts
are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting,
Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)
Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to requests for
production, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).)
In
Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.030
provides that the court may impose sanctions “[t]o the extent authorized by the
chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of
this title.”  Code of Civil Procedure
section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process”
to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery.”  Where a party or attorney
has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary
sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd.
(a).)
Discussion 
Defendant AAA served each of the Plaintiffs with form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production on November
30, 2023.  (Harwood Decls., ¶ 3 &
Exhs. A-B.)  Neither Plaintiff has
responded to any of these discovery requests. 
(Id., ¶ 5.)
AAA need not show
anything more.  The motions to compel are
GRANTED.
 
AAA’s requests for
sanctions are denied.
 
Defendants
seek sanctions under section 2030.290, subdivision (c); section 2031.300,
subdivision (c); and section 2023.030.  
 
Section
2030.290, subdivision (c), and section 2031.300, subdivision (c), authorize an
award of sanctions against a party or attorney “who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes” a motion to compel initial responses. 
Here, no opposition was filed, and so no award of sanctions is
authorized under these provisions.  
 
Section
2023.030 does “not independently authorize the trial court to
impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.”  (City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers,
LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504.)  (The Court is aware
that the California Supreme Court has granted review of the City of Los
Angeles case, but the Court notes that the order granting review, filed on
January 25, 2023, states that pending review, the appellate opinion “may be
cited,” including “for its persuasive value.”  The Court finds the
reasoning of Justice Moor in the City of Los Angeles case to be
persuasive.)
