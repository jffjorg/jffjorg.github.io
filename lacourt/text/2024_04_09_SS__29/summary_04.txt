Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion to set aside the default judgment entered against the defendant, Forum Entertainment, LLC. The plaintiff, Caroline Castaneda, had filed a complaint against the defendant, alleging negligence and premises liability, following a slip and fall on March 19, 2022. The defendant had filed a motion to set aside the default judgment, which was previously denied as untimely. However, the parties have since entered into a settlement agreement, and the court has found that setting aside the default judgment would not have an adverse effect on nonparties or the public. Therefore, the court has granted the motion to set aside the default judgment and has ordered the entire action to be dismissed with prejudice.
