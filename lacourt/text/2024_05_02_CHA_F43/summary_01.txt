And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to disqualify opposing counsel, Randall M. Awad, due to his ineligibility to practice law in California. The plaintiff notified Awad of his ineligibility in January 2024, but he failed to respond or provide notice of his ineligibility. The judge found that Awad's continued representation of the defendants would threaten the integrity of the judicial process and would constitute an ethical violation and unauthorized practice of law. The judge relied on California law and case citations to support the decision to disqualify Awad.
