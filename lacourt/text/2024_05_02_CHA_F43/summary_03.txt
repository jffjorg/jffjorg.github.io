The court grants Defendants' motion to set aside default. The court finds that the lack of response to the complaint was due to the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, or neglect. The court notes that the law favors hearings on the merits, so any doubts as to the application of CCP ยง 473 should be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default. The court imposes a penalty of $1,000 against each Defendant's attorney, Nicholas Koo, for a total of $2,000. The court also orders Koo to pay a total of $2,000 to Plaintiff's counsel for the defaults.
