And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to continue the trial date, final status conference, and all trial related dates. The motion was filed by the Department of Transportation (Moving Defendant) and is unopposed. The judge finds that Moving Defendant has shown good cause to continue trial, as its trial counsel is absent and it needs to conduct extensive discovery to investigate possible claims against LADWP. However, the judge cannot grant the motion as it was filed and served less than 16 court days prior to the hearing, as required by law. The judge orders the motion to be continued to March 6, 2024, so that Moving Defendant can provide proper notice to all interested parties.
