And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants defendant's motion to deem admissions admitted, imposing sanctions against plaintiff in the amount of $435.00. The plaintiff failed to respond to defendant's requests for admission, despite being served with the requests and a meet and confer letter. The judge finds that plaintiff's failure to respond was a misuse of the discovery process, and therefore orders plaintiff to pay defendant's reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, in the amount of $435.00.
