I.           
INTRODUCTION
The complaint arises from Plaintiff Gianna
Pilato (“Plaintiff”) injuring herself while riding a motorized scooter. On
April 15, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Complaint against Defendants City of Los
Angeles (“City”), County of Los Angeles (“County”), California Department of
Transportation (“CDOT”), Bird Rides, Inc. (“Bird”), Segway, Inc., and DOES 1-50
(collectively, “Defendants”), alleging causes of action for premises liability,
strict liability, and negligence. 
On October 3, 2022, Defendant Bird
filed a petition to compel arbitration (the “Petition”). On December 8, 2022,
the Court granted Defendant Bird’s Petition and compelled arbitration of
Plaintiff’s claims against Defendant Bird. The Court stayed this action pending
the completion of arbitration between Plaintiff and Defendant Bird. 
On December 19, 2022, Plaintiff filed a
request for dismissal as to Defendant County and Defendant County was dismissed
from this action on December 22, 2022. 
On December 20, 2022, Plaintiff filed a
request for dismissal as to Defendant Bird and Defendant Bird was dismissed
from this action on December 27, 2022.  
On July 20, 2023, the Court held a status
conference re: arbitration, and the Court lifted the stay of this action in its
entirety. 
On December 18, 2023, Defendant CDOT
was dismissed from this action pursuant to Plaintiff’s request for dismissal
filed on December 14, 2023. 
On January 3, 2024, R. Ethan Posey of
Wolfe & Wyman LLP filed and served the instant motion to be relieved as
counsel for Defendant City. Trial in this action is not currently set. 
 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
The court may order that an attorney be
changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment or final
determination upon request by either client or attorney and after notice from
one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(2).) “The determination whether to
grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion
of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 An application to be relieved as
counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and
Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1362(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(e)). The proposed order must specify all hearing dates scheduled in
the action or proceeding, including the date of trial, if known.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 Further, the requisite forms must
be served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the
case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay the
effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy
of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) A motion to withdraw will not be granted
where withdrawal would prejudice the client. 
(Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994)
21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
 
 
III.       
DISCUSSION
R. Ethan Posey of Wolfe & Wyman LLP
declares that the attorney-client relationship has been compromised and a
withdrawal of representation is necessary due to the non-payment of attorneys’
fees and expenses. (Form MC-052.) Counsel declares that Defendant City has been
advised of the status of the case. (Id.) 
The proof of service in support of the
motion indicates that the motion was served on Defendant City by mail and by
electronic service. Counsel attests to verifying Defendant City’s current
address through the website of Defendant City. (Form MC-052, ¶ 3(b)(1)(d).)  
Counsel has stated a valid basis to be
relieved as counsel. The Court, however, cannot grant the motion as counsel did
not complete the MC-051 Form. The Court notes that while the caption box on the
MC-051 Form does set forth the hearing date, time, and location pertaining to
the motion, counsel did not set forth the date or time in Section 2 of such
form. (Form MC-051, ¶ 2(a).) Also, Section 3 on the MC-051 Form is left blank
as counsel did not specify what supporting declaration accompanies the motion.
(Form MC-051, ¶ 3.) 
Thus, the Court CONTINUES the hearing
on the motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant City to Thursday, March 21,
2024 at 1:30 PM in this department, for counsel correct the above identified
deficiencies. 
IV.        
CONCLUSION
The motion to be relieved as counsel for
Defendant City is CONTINUED to Thursday, March 21, 2024 at 1:30 PM in this
department. Counsel is instructed to file and serve a revised motion at least 16
court days before the continued hearing in accordance with CCP § 1005(b). 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
