And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the City of Signal Hill's motion for leave to take a subsequent deposition of Thomas Bekele, the person most qualified to testify on behalf of the City. The City seeks to introduce newly discovered historical documents that were not available at the time of Bekele's initial deposition on August 1, 2023. The court finds that good cause exists to take the subsequent deposition and that the introduction of the newly discovered documents would not amount to a new legal theory. The court also finds that the City acted diligently in locating the historical documents and that discovery is broader than admissibility. The court concludes that the City has not established that it will be irreparably prejudiced if the motion is granted and therefore grants the motion. The parties are advised to submit on the tentative ruling and to be prepared to argue the matter at the hearing.
