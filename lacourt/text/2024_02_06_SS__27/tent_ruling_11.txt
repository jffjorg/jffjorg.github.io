[1] Trial is not currently scheduled
for March 22, 2024. Trial is scheduled to commence on April 5, 2024. Thus, the
Court assumes Moving Defendant made a typographical error in its notice of
motion as to the current trial date or is instead referring to the Final Status
Conference date which is March 22, 2024. 


[2] The Motion references a
declaration from a person with the last name of “Na.” However, no declaration
from such individual was filed with the Motion. The sole declaration filed in
support of the Motion is that of Nusha F. Ahmed (“Ahmed”).
