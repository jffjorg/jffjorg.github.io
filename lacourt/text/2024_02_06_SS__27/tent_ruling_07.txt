TENTATIVE
            Defendant’s Motion to Deem
Admissions Admitted is GRANTED. The Court imposes
sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $435.00.   
 

Background
            This case was commenced by Ambros
Gudino (Plaintiff) on August 26, 2022, when Plaintiff filed a Complaint
alleging that Marvin Gonzalez (Defendant) was negligent after colliding with
Plaintiff’s vehicle. The Complaint alleged two causes of action against
Defendant: (1) motor vehicle negligence, and (2) general negligence. Defendant
now files the motion before the Court, Defendant’s Motion to Deem
Admissions Admitted (Motion). 
 
Discussion
 
Legal Standard
            Code of
Civil Procedure § 2033.250, provides, in pertinent part, that “[w]ithin 30 days
after service of the request for admissions . . . the party to whom the
requests are directed shall serve the original of the response to them on the
requesting party.” A motion to deem admitted requests for admissions lies based
upon a showing of failure to respond timely. (CCP §2033.280(b); Demyer v.
Costa Mesa Mobile Home Estates (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 393, 395, disapproved
on other grounds by Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 983.) 
 
            If a party
to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the following rules apply:
   (a) The party to
whom the requests for admission are directed waives any objection to the
requests, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work
product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on
motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both
of the following conditions are satisfied:
   (1) The party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections
2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230.
   (2) The party's
failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect. (CCP § 2033.280)
 
Analysis
            Defendant
provides the Declaration of Terence Phan (Phan Decl.) which states that after
the Court granted a motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff’s initial
counsel, Defendant served Requests for Admission, Set One on Plaintiff on
September 6, 2023. (Phan Decl., ¶ 4.) On October 19, 2023, Defendant mailed a
meet and confer letter to Plaintiff regarding the overdue discovery responses.
(Phan Decl., ¶ 5.) To date, no responses nor objections were served on
Defendant. (Phan Decl., ¶ 6.) The Motion remains unopposed. 
 
Sanctions
            “The court
may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.” (CCP § 2023.030(a).) “Misuses of the discovery process
include, but are not limited to, the following: (d) Failing to respond or to
submit to an authorized method of discovery.” (CCP § 2023.010)
 
            Defense
counsel requests $435.00 in sanctions. This sanction request is reasonable.
Therefore, the Court imposes sanctions against Plaintiff, and awards them to
Defendant in the amount of 435.00. 
 
 
Conclusion
            Defendant’s
Motion to Deem Admissions Admitted is GRANTED. Further, the
Court orders Plaintiff to pay $435.00 in sanctions to Defendant, to be paid
directly to defense counsel, within 20 days of this ruling.   
 
 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
