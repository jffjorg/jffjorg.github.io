And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The moving parties, Burrell Construction, Inc. and George Robles, Jr., have filed a motion to strike the Answer to the Complaint and First Amended Cross-Complaint filed by The Dream @Tamarind, LLC, and to enter default on The Dream @Tamarind, LLC. The Court has reviewed the motion and the pleadings filed by the parties.

The Court finds that The Dream @Tamarind, LLC has been unrepresented since September 8, 2023, despite being warned six months ago that it faced a significant risk of proceeding without counsel. Given that trial is less than one week away, the Court grants the motion and strikes the pleadings of The Dream @Tamarind, LLC, and enters default on the company.

The Court agrees with the arguments made by Burrell Construction, Inc. and George R. Robles, Jr. that the pleadings of The Dream @Tamarind, LLC should be stricken and default entered due to the company's failure to retain new counsel.
