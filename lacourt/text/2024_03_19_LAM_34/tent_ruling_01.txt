against Defendant A1 American Builders Inc. on a cause of action for
negligence. 
 
On November

the doe defendants from the Complaint. 
 
On January
11, 2023, the Court scheduled Trial for December 4, 2023.
 
On July 24,
2023, Plaintiff filed its First Amended Complaint (FAC). 
 
On October
18, 2023, the Court denied the Parties’ request to continue trial because no
good cause was shown. 
 
On November
17, 2023, the Court on its own motion continued Trial from December 4, 2023 to
May 13, 2024. The Court stated: “No further continuance allowed.” (Minute Order
dated November 17, 2023, p. 1.)
 
On December
4, 2023, Defendant filed its Answer to the FAC.
 
On February
5, 2024, the Court denied the Parties’ request to continue trial, noting its
prior statement of “No further continuances.” (Minute Order dated February 5,
2024, p. 1.)
 
On February 20,
2024, Defendant filed its Motion to Continue Trial. Defendant concurrently
filed its Proposed Order. 
 
No opposition
or other response has been filed to the Motion. 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
Pursuant to California Rules of Court Rule
3.1332(b), “[a] party seeking a continuance of the date set for trial, whether
contested or uncontested or stipulated to by the parties, must make the request
for a continuance by a noticed motion or an ex parte application under the
rules in chapter 4 of this division, with supporting declarations. The party
must make the motion or application as soon as reasonably practical once the
necessity for the continuance is discovered.” 
 
“Although continuances of trials are
disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own
merits. The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of
good cause requiring the continuance.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(c);
See also In re Marriage of Falcone (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 814, 823
(“Continuances
are granted only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring a
continuance.”).)
 
Rule 3.1332(c) indicates that circumstances
that may indicate good cause include “the unavailability of trial counsel
because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances,” “[a] party's
excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material
evidence despite diligent efforts,” and “[a] significant, unanticipated change
in the status of the case a result of which the case is not ready for trial.”
 
Other factors to consider under California
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(d) include:
 
(1) The proximity of
the trial date;
 
(2) Whether there was
any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any
party;
 
(3) The length of the
continuance requested;
 
(4) The availability
of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion or
application for a continuance;
 
(5) The prejudice that
parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;
 
(6) If the case is
entitled to a preferential trial setting, the
reasons for that
status and whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid
delay;
 
(7) The court's calendar
and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials;
 
(8) Whether trial
counsel is engaged in another trial;
 
(9) Whether all
parties have stipulated to a continuance;
 
(10) Whether the
interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the
matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance; and
 
(11) Any other fact
or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or
application.
 
II.       Discussion
 
Defendant
moves the Court to vacate the current Trial and Trial Readiness Conferences
dates and to continue them until November 2024 or later. (Motion, p. 6:19–22.)
 
Defendant argues
that there is good cause for the requested continuance. (Motion, p. 4:4–5.)
Specifically, Defendant states: (1) that the Parties have not conducted
discovery, depositions, site inspections, expert discovery, or written
discovery; (2) that Defense Counsel has recently substituted into this matter;
(3) that Defendant has not previously requested a trial continuance; (4) that
the Parties have stipulated to the requested continuance; (5) that no party
will suffer prejudice from the continuance; (6) that Defendant will suffer
significant prejudice if it does not have more time to conduct discovery; and
(7) that the interests of justice are best served by the continuance. (Id. at
pp. 4:25-27, 5:1–2, 5:9–13, 6:6–7, 6:10–17.)
 
        Plaintiff
does not oppose the Motion. 
 
        The
Court disagrees with both parties. 
 
This case was
filed more than three years ago. The Court recognizes that there was
significant delay in this matter due to the entry and subsequent vacatur of
default judgment. Yet it appears that no discovery has been conducted by either
side during the past fourteen months since November 7, 2022, when the Court
vacated the default judgment. Furthermore, when Plaintiff and Defendant requested
via stipulation at multiple hearings for continuances, the Court was
consistently clear that there would not be any further continuances. (Minute Order dated November 17, 2023, p. 1;
Minute Order dated February 5, 2024, p. 1.)
 
Good cause
has not been shown. 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The Motion to Continue Trial is DENIED.
