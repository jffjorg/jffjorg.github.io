Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay or dismiss judicial proceedings. The defendant, West Covina Auto Retail, Inc., moved to compel arbitration and stay or dismiss the case pending the completion of arbitration, citing a purported arbitration agreement in the Retail Installment Sale Contract (RISC) signed by the plaintiff, Kaitlyn Limpias. The plaintiff argued that the defendant did not establish the existence of an arbitration agreement and that the agreement is invalid due to procedural and substantive unconscionability.

The judge found that the defendant failed to meet its burden of proving the existence of an arbitration agreement by a preponderance of the evidence. The defendant's declaration, submitted by Gen Balouev, did not sufficiently lay a proper foundation for authentication of the purported RISC and the arbitration agreement contained within it. The judge also noted that there was no declaration from anyone stating that the plaintiff signed the document, nor was there any evidence that the defendant followed its "custom and practice" in this particular case.

As a result, the judge denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and stay or dismiss judicial proceedings.
