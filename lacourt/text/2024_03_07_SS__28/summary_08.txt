The Tentative Ruling states that the court grants Defendant Robert R. Nacar's motion to compel Plaintiff Abrion Sims's responses to form interrogatories, set two, and orders Sims to serve verified code-compliant responses, without objections, by April 5, 2024. The court denies Nacar's motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set one. The court also grants Nacar's requests for sanctions and orders Sims and his counsel to pay Nacar $820.00 by April 5, 2024. The ruling is based on the failure of Sims to serve timely responses to the interrogatories and requests for admission, and the court finds that Sims's late responses are not in substantial compliance with statutory requirements.
