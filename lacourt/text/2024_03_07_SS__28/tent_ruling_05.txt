PARTY’S REQUESTS 
White
asks the Court to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission,
set one, and award sanctions. 
LEGAL STANDARD  
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides: 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission
are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on
privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing
with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this
waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are
satisfied:  
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response
that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and
2033.230.  
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely
response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the
truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as well as
for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010).  
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it
finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.”  
(Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280.)  
DISCUSSION  
On December
13, 2023, White served requests for admission, set one, on Plaintiff. 
Plaintiff
did not provide timely responses and had not provided responses by the time
White filed the motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for
admission.   The Court grants the motion
and deems admitted the matters specified in the requests for admission. 
Sanctions
are mandatory under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c).  Defendant requests $1,685.00 in sanctions based
on five hours of attorney time at a rate of $325.00 per hour and one $60.00
filing fee.  Counsel spent three hours to
prepare the motion and anticipated spending one hour to prepare a reply and one
hour to attend the hearing.  The Court
awards $560.00 in sanctions based on two hours of attorney time at a reasonable rate of
$250.00 per hour and one filing fee. 
CONCLUSION 
          The Court GRANTS Defendant Kimberlee
“Kim” White’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for
admission, set one, and deems the matters admitted. 
          The Court GRANTS Defendant
Kimberlee “Kim” White’s request for sanctions and
orders Plaintiff Valerie Roberts and her counsel to pay Defendant Kimberlee “Kim” White $560.00 by April 8,
