reviewed the petition for expedited approval of minor’s compromise, the Court
rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
          On September 8, 2021, Plaintiffs Sintia Marvely Garcia
Samayon (“Garcia”) and Luna Marvella Velasquez (“Luna Velasquez”) filed this
action against Defendants Jose Elias Jaime (“Defendant”) and Does 1-20 for
negligence. 
          On March 8, 2023, the Court dismissed the action without
prejudice.  On May 25, 2023, the Court
granted Plaintiffs’ motion to vacate the dismissal. 
          On July 5, 2023, Garcia filed a notice of settlement.  On September 20, 2023, the Court dismissed
Garcia’s action with prejudice at Garcia’s request. 
          On February 5, 2024, Petitioner Jose
Velasquez (“Petitioner”) filed a petition for expedited approval of the
compromise of the claims of minor Luna Velasquez (“Claimant”).

of Claimant’s action. 
DISCUSSION

TOTAL MEDICAL
EXPENSES: information not provided 
COSTS:
$585.85 
ATTORNEY’S

BALANCE
OF PROCEEDS: unclear 
Section
13a of the petition lists no medical expenses, reductions, amounts to be paid
or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds, or liens.  However, Section 13c(2) states that Medi-Cal
paid some or all of Claimant’s medical expenses and will accept $154.73 to
satisfy its lien rights.  Section
17b of the petition states that $1,154.73 in medical expenses will be paid from
the proceeds of the settlement.  The
petition does not explain the basis for the $1,154.73 amount.  Petitioner should modify the petition to
include the requested amounts in Section 13a and provide information supporting
the amounts listed. 
In
Section 14a of the petition, Petitioner requests $1,154.73 in attorney’s fees.  However, Section 17c of the petition requests
$1,750.00 in attorney’s fees.  Petitioner
should modify the petition to make the requests consistent. 
Section
19b(2) of the petition states that $3,509.42 will be deposited in insured
accounts in one or more financial institutions in this state, subject to
withdrawal only on authorization of the court.  It also states that the name, branch, and address
of each depository are specified in Attachment 19b(2).  The petition does not include Attachment 19b(2).

          The Court DENIES the petition for expedited approval of the
compromise of minor Luna Marvella Velasquez’s action filed by Petitioner Jose
Velasquez on February 5, 2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
