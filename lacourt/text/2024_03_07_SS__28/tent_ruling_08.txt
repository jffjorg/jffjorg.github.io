filed this action against Defendants Robert R. Nacar
(“Defendant”) and Does 1-20 for motor vehicle tort and general negligence. 
On
December 15, 2022, Defendant filed an answer and a cross-complaint against
Cross-Defendants Sims and Roes 1-20 for indemnity and contribution.  On January 11, 2023, Sims filed an answer to
the cross-complaint.

in requests for admission and for sanctions. 
The motions were set to be heard on March 7, 2024.  On February 23, 2024, Sims filed an
opposition. On February 29, 2024, Defendant filed a reply. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for May 6, 2024. 
PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Defendant
asks the Court to compel Sims to serve verified code-compliant responses to form
interrogatories, set two, to deem admitted matters specified in requests
for admission, set one, and to award sanctions. 
Sims
asks the Court to deny the motions and deny the requests for sanctions. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
A.   Interrogatories 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 provides: 
“If a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the interrogatories are
directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under
Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including
one based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that
party from this waiver on its determination that both of the following
conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The party propounding the interrogatories may
move for an order compelling response to the interrogatories. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to
interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling
answers, the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition
of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290.) 
B.       Requests for admission 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 2033.280 provides: 
“If a party to whom requests for admission are
directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply: 
“(a) The party to whom the requests for admission are
directed waives any objection to the requests, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
“(1) The party has subsequently served a response that
is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. 
“(2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response
was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
“(b) The requesting party may move for an order that
the genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010). 
“(c) The court shall make this order, unless it finds
that the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220. It is
mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing
with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to
serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this motion.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.280.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Defendant’s motion to compel responses to form
interrogatories 
On December
19, 2023, Defendant served form interrogatories, set two, on Sims. 
Sims
did not provide timely responses to the form interrogatories and had not
provided responses by the time Defendant filed the motion to compel responses
on February 8, 2024. 
Sims
argues that on February 23, 2024, he served verified responses to the form
interrogatories that substantially comply with statutory requirements.  Therefore, Sims argues, the Court should deny
Defendant’s motion to compel responses and deny Defendant’s request for
sanctions. 
The
Court has reviewed the interrogatory responses attached to Sims’s
opposition.  Even though Sims waived his
objections to the form interrogatories by failing to serve timely responses,
and the Court has not relieved Sims from this waiver (see Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290,
subd. (a)), Sims’s responses contain objections. 
Sims
failed to serve a timely response to the form interrogatories.  Due to Sims’s improper objections in his
late-served responses, Defendant’s motion is not moot.  
Contrary
to Sims’s contention, Defendant was not required to meet and confer before
filing the motion to compel.  (See L.
Edmon & C. Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial
(Rutter 2023) ¶ 8:1141, p. 8F-59 (Cal. Practice Guide) [“The moving party is
not required to show a ‘reasonable and good faith attempt’ to resolve the
matter informally with opposing counsel before filing the motion”].)  This is because “[t]he failure to timely
respond waives all objections to the interrogatories [citation], so there are
no issue left to ‘resolve’ with opposing counsel.”  (Id., ¶ 8:1142, p. 8F-59.) 
The
Court grants Defendant’s motion to compel and orders Sims to serve verified
code-compliant responses to the form interrogatories, without objections, by
April 5, 2024. 
Defendant requests $585.00 in sanctions based on three
hours of attorney time at a rate of $175.00 per hour and one $60.00 filing
fee.  Counsel spent one hour to prepare
the moving papers and anticipated spending two hours to attend the hearing.  The Court grants $410.00 in sanctions based
on two hours of attorney time and one filing fee. 
B.   Defendant’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in
requests for admission 
On December
19, 2023, Defendant served requests for admission, set one, on Sims. 
Sims
did not provide timely responses to the requests for admission and had not
provided responses by the time Defendant filed the motion to deem admitted
matters specified in requests for admission on February 8, 2024. 
Sims
argues that on February 23, 2024, he served verified responses to the requests
for admission that substantially comply with statutory requirements. Therefore, Sims argues, the Court should deny
Defendant’s motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission
and deny Defendant’s request for sanctions. 
The
Court must deny a motion to deem admitted matters specified in requests for
admission when “the party to whom the requests for admission have been directed
has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the
requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section 2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)  
The statute governing motions to compel responses to
interrogatories does not contain similar language.  Under that statute (Code
of Civil Procedure section 2030.290), a party must move for relief from the
waiver of objections resulting from the failure to serve timely responses.  But Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290 does not expressly require
the Court to deny a motion to compel when the party to whom the interrogatories
have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion to compel, a
proposed response.  The statute refers to
a party’s “substantial compliance” with statutory requirements only in the
context of the Court’s decision whether to relieve the party, on the party's motion, of the
party’s waiver of objections. 
Therefore,
while the Court granted Defendant’s motion to compel Sims’s responses to form
interrogatories, the Court denies Defendant’s motion to deem admitted matters
specified in requests for admission.  The
Court reaches this conclusion even though Sims’s late-served responses to the
requests for admission, like Sims's responses to the form interrogatories, contain
improper objections.  (See Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 8:1374.3, p.
8G-25 [“Remember that all objections to the RFAs are now waived (by failure
to timely respond [citation].)  Thus, the
only permitted responses to the requests are admissions, denials, or statements
of inability to admit or deny for lack of information”].) 
Under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (c), “[i]t is enough that
the response [to requests for admission] ‘substantially’ complies with [Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.220].” 
(Cal. Practice Guide, supra, ¶ 8:1374.1,
p. 8G-24.)  “To make this
determination, the court must evaluate the response ‘in toto,’ rather than
based on responses to individual RFAs.” 
(Id., ¶ 8:1374.1, pp. 8G-24 to 8G-25.)  The Court has reviewed Sims’s late-served
responses to the requests for admission and concludes that they substantially
comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.220.  This conclusion does not, however, preclude
Defendant from moving for further responses to the requests for admission if
Defendant believes a motion appropriate. 
Even
when the Court is required to deny a motion to deem admitted matters specified
in requests for admission, “[i]t is mandatory that the court impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney,
or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated
[the] motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.2280,
subd. (c).) 
Defendant
requests $585.00 in sanctions based on three hours of attorney time at a rate
of $175.00 per hour and one $60.00 filing fee. 
Counsel spent one hour to prepare the moving papers and anticipated
spending two hours to prepare for and attend the hearing.  The Court grants $410.00 in sanctions based
on two hours of attorney time and one filing fee. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court GRANTS Defendant
Robert R. Nacar’s motion to compel responses to form interrogatories, set two,
and orders Plaintiff Abrion Sims to serve verified code-compliant responses,
without objections, to the form interrogatories by April 5, 2024. 
The Court DENIES Defendant Robert R. Nacar’s motion to
deem admitted matters specified in requests for admission, set one. 
The
Court GRANTS Defendant Robert R. Nacar’s requests for sanctions and orders Plaintiff
Abrion Sims and his counsel to pay Defendant
Robert R. Nacar $820.00 ($410.00 on each motion) by April 5, 2024.
