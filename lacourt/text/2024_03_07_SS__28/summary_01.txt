And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a petition to approve a compromise of the pending action of Plaintiff Xiaoling Mai. The compromise involves a settlement of $902,364.88 in medical expenses, with $543,686.28 already reduced through various means. However, the proposed compromise only provides for payment of $91,910.17 from the settlement proceeds, leaving $266,768.43 in unpaid medical expenses. The judge is worried that this discrepancy may not be reasonable and has ordered the petitioner to explain why the remaining unpaid medical expenses will not be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.

The judge is also considering a request to create and/or fund a special needs trust for the benefit of Plaintiff Xiaoling Mai. The proposed trust instrument meets the requirements for court-created or funded trusts, and the judge is granting the request for broader investment authority for the trustee.

Finally, the judge is ordering the submission of a $75,340.26 bond by the trustee and setting a date for the first accounting due date and an OSC to ensure funding of the settlement, submission of the bond, and filing of the necessary documents. The hearing on the petition is continued to March 7, 2024.
