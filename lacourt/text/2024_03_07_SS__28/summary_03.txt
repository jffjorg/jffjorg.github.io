The petition requests approval of a settlement amount of $7,000.00, but there are inconsistencies in the petition regarding attorney's fees and medical expenses. The petition does not provide sufficient information to support the requested amounts, and the Court has ordered Petitioner to modify the petition to include the requested amounts and provide information supporting the amounts listed. The Court also orders Petitioner to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within five days.
