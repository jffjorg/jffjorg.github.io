2024.

PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
Yu Mai asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of
Plaintiff Xiaoling Mai. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
The
parties to a lawsuit may settle the claim of a person who lacks the capacity to
make decisions only with court approval. (Prob. Code., §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372; see Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202
Cal.App.4th 1333, 1337.) 
A
petition for court approval of a compromise or covenant not to sue under Code
of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court,
rules 7.950, 7.951 and 7.952. The petition must be verified by the petitioner
and contain a full disclosure of all information that has “any bearing upon the
reasonableness” of the compromise or the covenant. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
7.950.) 
The
person compromising the claim on behalf of the person who lacks capacity, and
the represented person, must attend the hearing on compromise of the claim
unless the court for good cause dispenses with their personal appearance. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 7.952.) 
DISCUSSION 
A.   Non-trust issues 
Section
12a(1) of the petition states that total medical expenses were $902,364.88.  Section 12a(3) states that, of this amount, $543,686.28
was the subject of negotiated, contractual, or statutory reductions.  This should mean that the difference between
these two amounts – $358,678.60 – will be paid or
reimbursed from the settlement proceeds. 
However, Section 12a(4) states that only $91,910.17 will
be paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  
Petitioner
should explain why $266,768.43 in medical expenses (the difference between $358,678.60
and $91,910.17) will not be paid or reimbursed from the settlement
proceeds.  The Court cannot approve a
compromise unless all medical expenses that have not been waived or reduced are
paid or reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  
B.   Special needs trust 
The
main requirements for court created or funded trusts are set forth at
California Rules of Court, rule 7.903(c), and LASC rule 4.116(b).  The proposed trust instrument meets those
requirements and is ready for approval for creation and/or funding. 
Petitioner
makes the following additional requests for relief that are beyond those
fundamental to the approval and funding of a settlement trust: 
Petitioner
requests authority for trustee to invest in proprietary funds, mutual funds,
and bonds with maturity dates greater than five years to provide for
diversification and a higher rate of investment return.  (Court’s pdf at p. 63, para. 3.)  This request would provide for a broader
investment authority than the statutory baseline.  The Court grants this request. 
The
proposed initial trustee is Lilit Movsesyan, a private professional fiduciary
(PPF) in Glendale, California.  Normally,
bond is required of a trustee unless the trustee is a corporate fiduciary.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.903(c)(5); Prob. Code, § 2320.)  A PPF does not meet
that definition and bond is required.  
Petitioner
requests a $75,340.26 bond.  The
calculation appears to be correct based on the assets to be funded into the
trust, plus anticipated annual income from investments and any annuity, plus an
additional amount required for the costs of any recovery on the bond.  
The
Court orders that the $75,340.26 bond be submitted by the trustee to this
department.  The bond will later be
resubmitted to the Probate Court in any trust supervision action. 
ORDERS/PROPOSED ORDER: 
The
proposed order should be modified to add a 14-month calendar date for the first
accounting due date (at p. 30, para. 9 of the proposed order). 
In
addition, the proposed order should be modified to add a 60-day calendar date for an OSC in this civil
department to ensure funding of the settlement,
submission of the bond, purchase of an annuity (if relevant), and filing of
LASC Form PRO 044 to open a trust supervision action in the Probate Court (at p. 30 of
proposed order). 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court CONTINUES the hearing on the petition to approve the compromise of
Plaintiff Xiaoling Mai’s action to a date
to be provided at the March 7, 2024 hearing. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file a proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
