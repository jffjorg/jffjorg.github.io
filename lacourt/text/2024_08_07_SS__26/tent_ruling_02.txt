(“Plaintiff”) in the action entitled Desert Passage Community Association v.

Discussion
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
The Motion is accompanied by a
request for judicial notice of the (1) Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and
Restrictions for Desert Passage recorded in the Pinal County, Arizona
Recorder's Office on December 30, 2004 as Instrument No. 2004-108203; (2)
Judgment entered in the Justice Court, Maricopa-Stanfield Precinct, County of
Pinal, State of Arizona in the action entitled Desert Passage Community
Association v. Gabriel Serrato and Monica Serrato in Case No. CV2017-0049;
and (3) Judgment on Sister-State Judgment entered in the above-entitled action,
in the Los Angeles County Superior Court, case number 20STCP03969. The request
for judicial notice is granted pursuant to Evidence Code section 452,
subdivisions (c) and (d). 
 
Entitlement
to Attorney Fees and Costs
 
“The judgment creditor may claim under this section the
following costs of enforcing a judgment: . . . (6) Attorney's fees, if allowed by Section
685.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.070, subd. (a).) Code of Civil Procedure, section 685.040
states: “The
judgment creditor is entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs of
enforcing a judgment. Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are not
included in costs collectible under this title unless otherwise provided by
law. Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are included as
costs collectible under this title if the underlying judgment includes an award
of attorney’s fees to the judgment creditor pursuant
to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) of Section
1033.5.” Also, the motion must be brought with two years of the incurred costs.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 685.080, subd. (a).) 
 
Based on the award of attorney’s fees in the judgment from the
sister-state case and the Court’s earlier order awarding attorney’s fees, Plaintiff is again entitled to attorney’s
fees incurred enforcing its judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 685.040.
(Motion, RJN, Exh. 2, p. 2.) The Motion is timely filed regarding fees incurred
from July 1, 2022 and May 31, 2024. Judgment Creditor seeks fees of $2,267.50
and costs of $693.60. (Motion, Bailio Decl., ¶¶17-18.) 
 
Calculation
of Attorney Fees and Costs
 
The Court’s objective is to award
attorney fees at the fair market value
based on the particular action.  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24
Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)  “The reasonable
hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.”  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “‘[T]he fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily
begins with the 'lodestar,' i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended
multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate . . . .’” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001)
24 Cal.4th 1122, 1134.)  The lodestar method is based on the factors, as
relevant to the particular case: “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent
to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”  (Id. at 1132.) “The ‘‘experienced
trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in
his court, and while his judgment is of course
subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong.’’” (Id.) A negative modifier was appropriate
when duplicative work had been performed.
(Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819.) 
 
Plaintiff
submits the declaration of its attorney, B. Austin Baillio (“Baillio”), in
support of its request for attorney fees. Baillio declares he billed $325.00
per hour until January 1, 2023, after which he billed $375.00 an hour. (Motion,
Baillio Decl., ¶6.) During the relevant time, Baillio billed $1,587.50 for 3.1
hours of attorney time. (Id. at ¶¶7, 14 and Exh. A.) The firm’s
paralegals also billed $645.00 for four hours billed at $150.00 to 175.00 per
hour. (Id. at ¶¶10-13 and Exh. A, p. 1.) This attorney and paralegal
time was spent attending the hearing on the first motion for attorney’s fees, searching
for Defendants’ assets, communicating with Judgment Creditor, obtaining and
recording an abstract of judgment, and drafting the instant Motion. (Id.
at Exh. A.) 
 
The
Court finds the rates charged by Plaintiff’s counsel for the hours billed, and
the time billed on collection efforts, reasonable based on the attorneys’
experience and the limited amount of time spent on collection efforts and this
Motion. Accordingly, Plaintiff is awarded attorney’s fees of $2,232.50. Plaintiff
also seeks an award of $693.60 for investigation, filing fees, appearance
fees, and other costs. (Id. at Exh. A, p. 2.) These costs are likewise
supported by the attorney declaration and are awarded to Plaintiff. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff
Desert Passage Community Association’s Motion
for Award of Attorney Fees and Costs is GRANTED
IN THE AMOUNT OF $2,232.50 IN ATTORNEY FEES AND $693.60 IN COSTS.
