RULING:
 
Minor Plaintiff Benyamin Hendeles (“Minor
Plaintiff”), by and through their Guardian Ad Litem Avraham Hendeles
(“Petitioner”), filed the instant action for personal injuries against
Defendant John Doe (“Defendant”) on February 8, 2023. On June 12, 2024,
Petitioner filed an Expedited Petition to Approve Compromise of Pending Action
(“the Expedited Petition”) on behalf of minor Plaintiff. Following review, the
Court denied the Expedited Petition for failing to attach a copy of a doctor’s report
of Minor Plaintiff’s injuries or a prognosis of their recovery. (Minute Order,
06/24/24.) The Court ordered Petitioner to file an amended petition and set the
matter for hearing on August 7, 2024. (Ibid.) 
 
No amended petition has been filed
to date. Therefore, the hearing on the Petition to Approve Compromise of
Disputed Claim on behalf of minor Plaintiffs Benyamin Hendeles is PLACED OFF
CALENDAR.
