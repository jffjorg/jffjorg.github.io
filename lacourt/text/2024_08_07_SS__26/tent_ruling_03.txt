ANALYSIS:
 
On January 23, 2024, Defendant Administrative Services
Cooperative, Inc. (erroneously named as United Checker Cab CO-OP d/b/a Checker
Cab Co.) (“Defendant ASC”) served Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents, Sets One, on
Plaintiff Fasica Shiferaw (“Plaintiff”). (Motion,
Mendoza Decl., Exhs. B-D.) Despite a meet and confer effort extending
the deadline to serve verified responses, Plaintiff has not served responses to
the discovery. (Id. at Exhs. E-F.) Defendant ASC filed the instant
Motion to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories,
and Request for Production of Documents, Sets One, and Request for Sanctions,
on June 12, 2024. No opposition has been filed to date. 
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, 2031.300.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the
responding party fails to provide the responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.)
Based on Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond to the propounded discovery,
Defendant ASC is entitled to an order compelling service of verified responses
to the discovery requests without objections. 
 
Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond constitutes a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).) Sanctions
are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and 2023.030
and have been properly noticed. However, the amount sought is excessive for a
simple and unopposed motion. Pursuant to a lodestar calculation, sanctions are
awarded against Plaintiff in the amount of $490.00 based on two hours of
attorney time billed at $245.00 per hour. (Motion, Mendoza Decl., ¶8.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Administrative Services Cooperative, Inc.’s Motion
to Compel Responses to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Request
for Production, Sets One, and Request for Sanctions is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF FASICA SHIFERAW IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO THE
DISCOVERY REQUESTS WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
 
PLAINTIFF FASICA
SHIFERAW IS FURTHER ORDERED TO
PAY SANCTIONS OF $490.00 TO DEFENSE COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS
ORDER.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
