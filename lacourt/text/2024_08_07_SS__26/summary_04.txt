And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the hearing on the Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim on behalf of minor plaintiff Benyamin Hendeles is placed off calendar due to the failure of the petitioner, Avraham Hendeles, to file an amended petition as ordered by the court. The court previously denied an expedited petition to approve the compromise due to the lack of a doctor's report and prognosis of the minor plaintiff's recovery. The matter is now set for a new hearing date.
