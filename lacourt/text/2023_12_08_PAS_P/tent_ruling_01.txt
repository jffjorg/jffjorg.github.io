I.        INTRODUCTION
          In this defamation action, Plaintiff Ivy Zihan Geng (Geng) alleges
that Defendant Wansong Houaka Ella Wansong Hou aka Ella Tsai (Hou) started
spreading damaging rumors about Geng’s sex life. Around June and July of 2022, Geng
alleges that Hou published these rumors by phone and through WeChat to Geng’s
family, friends, and friends’ companies in China. She alleges she suffered
injuries to her personal reputation and business as a result of these
statements. The Complaint contains causes of action for: (1) libel per se, (2)
slander per se, (3) false light, (4) intentional infliction of emotional
distress, (5) injunctive relief and (6) declaratory relief.  
          Before the Court is one of four discovery motions by Geng filed
October 31, 2023.  The instant motion seeks
an order compelling Hou to provide responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One. The
motion is granted.  
 
          II.      LEGAL
STANDARD 
          Code Civ. Proc. Section 2030.290 provides that when a party
to whom interrogatories have been propounded fails to serve a timely response,
that party waives any objection to the interrogatories; it further provides
that the propounding party may move for an order compelling a response to the
interrogatory. Subdivision (c) provides for monetary sanctions in connection
with such motion. (CCP § 2030.290.)
“The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering
that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney
advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (CCP §
2023.030(a).) Misuse of the discovery process includes: “(d) failing to respond
or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.” (CCP § 2023.010(d).)
Reasonable expenses under CCP section 2023.030(a) include the time spent in
researching and preparing the motion, as well as court time and travel time
spent in connection with the motion. (Ghanooni
v. Super Shuttle (1993) 20
Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) 
 
          III.     DISCUSSION
          A. Motion
          On August 30, 2023, Geng served Hou with Form
Interrogatories, Set One via mail. Responses were due October 4, 2023. Hou did
not request an extension, nor express any reason why she could not provide
responses by this deadline. (Ma Declaration, ¶ 5.) When no responses were
received, Geng’s counsel, Caixing Ma, reached out via email on October 17,
2023, to inquire about the responses. (Ma Declaration ¶ 6, referencing Exh. 2.)
Counsel for Geng unilaterally extended the deadline to October 23, 2023. (Ma Decl.,
¶ 6.) No responses were received. As of the date this motion was filed, Hou had
not provided responses.
          Based on this record, Geng is entitled to the relief
requested: an order compelling Hou to provide verified, code-compliant
responses, without objections. 
 
          B. Sanctions
          Geng requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $935.00. Geng’s
counsel, Caixing Ma, declares that he spent 1.3 hours preparing the motion and
.7 hours preparing the declaration.  He
further anticipates .5 hour to be spent responding to an opposition and appearing
at the hearing. He also paid $60.00 for the filing fee. (Ma Decl. ¶ 8.) His
hourly rate is $350. (Id.) 
          The Court finds that 2.5 hours (1.3 hours for motion
preparation, .7 hours for preparing the declaration and .5 hours for appearance
at the hearing and responding to opposition) at the hourly rate of $350 is
reasonable. The Court finds that the hourly rate of $350 is reasonable.
          Accordingly, the Court issues monetary sanctions of $935
against Defendant Hou. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
          IV.     ORDER
          Hou is ordered to provide code compliant, verified
responses without objections to Plaintiff’s Form Interrogatories, Set One,
within 10 days of notice of this order. Hou is further ordered to pay monetary
sanctions to Plaintiff in the amount of $935.00 within 45 days of notice of
this order. 
Geng
is ordered to provide notice of this ruling.
