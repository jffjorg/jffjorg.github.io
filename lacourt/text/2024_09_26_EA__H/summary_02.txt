```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court rules that Xu Fan's demurrer to Sherman Liu and Connie Sheng's cross-complaint is sustained, with 20 days' leave to amend. The cross-complaint alleges a cause of action for breach of contract, but fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. Specifically, the cross-complaint does not identify whether the loan was oral or written, the parties' respective obligations, and the terms of repayment. The Court orders Liu and Sheng to amend their cross-complaint to cure these defects.
