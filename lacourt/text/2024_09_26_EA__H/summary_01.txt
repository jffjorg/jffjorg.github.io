And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to strike the punitive attachment from the Second Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiffs Sheldon Ross and Pamela Jones Calcote. The Court grants the motion, finding that the allegations in the complaint do not support a claim for punitive damages. The Court notes that punitive damages may be awarded in an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract upon clear and convincing evidence that a defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. However, the Court finds that the allegations in the complaint do not meet this standard. The Court also declines to take judicial notice of excerpts from Ross' and Calcote's depositions, as the request for judicial notice is not properly made. The Court will hear from Plaintiffs' counsel whether leave to amend is requested and if so, will require an offer of proof.
