 Case Number:  23PSCV01695    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2024    Dept:  H Puente  Hills Business Center, L.P. v. Fan (23PSCV01695)   ORDER  ON CROSS-DEFENDANT’S DEMURRER TO CROSS-COMPLAINT  Cross-Defendant  Xu Fan’s Demurrer to Cross-Complainants Sherman Liu’s and Connie Sheng’s  Cross-Complaint is SUSTAINED, with 20 days’ leave to amend. Background Plaintiff Puente Hills Business  Center, L.P. (“Puente Hills”) alleges as follows: On or about December 5, 2012, Puente  Hills, as landlord, and FCC Group International (U.S.A.), Inc. (“FCC”), as  tenant, entered into a written lease agreement (the “lease”) wherein FCC leased  the property located at 17870 Castleton Street, Suite 126, in the City of  Industry (the “original premises”) for a three-year term commencing January 18,  2013. Xu Yan Sherry Fan aka Xuyan Sherry Fan (“Fan”) executed a written  Guaranty of Lease (“Guaranty”).  The term of the lease was subsequently  extended. Amendment No. 1 added additional square footage to the lease (i.e.,  Suites 132 and 134) (together with Suite 126, the “expanded premises”) and  extended the lease term through January 31, 2017. A second amendment to the  lease, Amendment No. 2, reduced the square footage to the lease (i.e., omitting  Suite 126; the “reduced premises”) and extended the lease term through March  31, 2019. The third amendment to the lease, Amendment No. 3, extended the lease  term through March 31, 2022, increased base rent, and provided for scheduled  increases in base rent. Fan reaffirmed her guarantee of the lease by executing  all three amendments. FCC subleased or assigned the Lease to M Capital Global  California without Puente Hill’s knowledge or consent. FCC also failed to pay  all rent due. On  June 6, 2023, Puente Hills filed a complaint, asserting causes of action  against Fan and Does 1-10 for (1) breach of written guaranty and (2) common  count. On  March 14, 2024, Fan filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint, asserting causes of  action against Domain Technology & Economy Development, Inc., Sherman Liu  (“Liu”), Connie Sheng (erroneously sued as “Connie Tseng”) (“Sheng”), Puente  Hills, and Roes 1-10 for (1) indemnity, (2) fraud, (3) negligence, (4)  appropriation of name and likeness, and (5) identity theft.  On  April 11, 2024, Liu and Sheng filed a cross-complaint, asserting a cause of  action against Fan and Voes 1-10 for breach of contract.  Pending  before the Court is Cross-Defendant Fan’s Demurrer to Liu and Sheng’s  Cross-Complaint. Legal  Standard  A demurrer  may be made on the grounds that the pleading, inter alia, does not state facts  sufficient to constitute a cause of action and/or is uncertain. (Code Civ.  Proc., § 430.10, subds. (e) and (f).)  When  considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. In  a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading  or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian  v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the  pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it  lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are  judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d  902, 905 [citations omitted].) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need only  allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the factual basis  for the claim against him. (Semole v.  Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) “[A] demurrer does not,  however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in  the pleading, or the construction placed on an instrument pleaded therein, or  facts impossible in law, or allegations contrary to facts of which a court may  take judicial knowledge.” (S. Shore Land  Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 [citations omitted].)  Discussion Fan  demurs, per Code of Civil Procedure § 430.10, subdivisions (e) and (f)[FN1], to  the sole cause of action (i.e., for Breach of Contract) in Liu’s and Sheng’s  cross-complaint, on the basis that it fails to state facts sufficient to  constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. “To prevail on a  cause of action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove (1) the  contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance of the contract or excuse for  nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the  plaintiff.” (Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.)  A written contract  may be pleaded either by its terms—set out verbatim in the complaint or a copy  of the contract attached to the complaint and incorporated therein by  reference—or by its legal effect. In order to plead a contract by its legal  effect, plaintiff must allege the substance of its relevant terms.” (McKell  v. Washington Mutual, Inc. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1489 [internal  quotations and citations omitted].)  Liu and Sheng have  not attached a copy of any contract to their cross-complaint, nor have they set  forth any contract verbatim. Liu and Sheng have alleged, without more, that  they loaned Fan $30,000.00 in or about November/December 2019, at Feng’s request;  that Fan reaffirmed the loan in front of mutual friends and acquaintances on  many occasions, expressing that she owed them $30,000 for a loan they had given  her and that she would pay them the money back; that the most recent  affirmation of the loan was on or about September 1, 2022; and that Fan has  failed to pay back the $30,000, or any amount thereof, as of the complaint  filing date, despite their numerous requests and Fan’s numerous promises that  she would do so. (Cross-Complaint, ¶¶ 5-7 and 9-12.)  The foregoing  allegations fail to identify whether the loan was oral or written, the parties’  respective obligations, and the terms of repayment. The Court thus sustains the  demurrer, with 20 days’ leave to amend.
