Significant Statements:
- "Arbitration is generally favored under both the FAA and California law."
- "The existence of mutual consent is determined by objective rather than subjective criteria."
- "One who accepts or signs an instrument, which on its face is a contract, is deemed to assent to all its terms, and cannot escape liability on the ground that he has not read it."
- "Absent fraud or overreaching, [the plaintiff's] inability to read English and his limited ability to speak or understand English [did] not alter the conclusion that his signatures and initials on the contract manifested his agreement to its terms."
- "The party claiming waiver has a heavy burden; and a waiver will not be lightly inferred."
