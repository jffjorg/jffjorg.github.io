And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Mortgage Assets Management, LLC's motion to substitute PHH Mortgage Corporation as the plaintiff in this case. The complaint alleges that Mortgage Assets Management, LLC holds a 2006 deed of trust encumbering real property to secure a reverse mortgage, but that People's Federal Savings and Loan Association holds a deed of trust that is superior to Mortgage Assets Management, LLC's and should have been released after multiple refinances. The judge has granted the motion because Mortgage Assets Management, LLC has assigned the deed of trust to PHH Mortgage Corporation, and the court may allow the person to whom the transfer is made to be substituted in the action or proceeding, as provided by California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 368.5. The action will be continued in the name of PHH Mortgage Corporation as the plaintiff.
