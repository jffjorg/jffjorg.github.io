[TENTATIVE] ORDER
GRANTING PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR AN ORDER AND ENTRY OF JUDGMENT ENFORCING THE
SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT 
 
I.      
BACKGROUND
      The
complaint alleges that Defendant issued a written warranty to Plaintiffs in
connection with Plaintiffs’ lease of a 2022 Kia Nero-EV. The vehicle developed
electrical and other defects. Defendant allegedly failed to fulfill its
statutory duties under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“SBA”).
      Plaintiffs
accepted Defendant’s statutory offer of compromise to repurchase Plaintiffs’
vehicle for $18,537.60. Plaintiffs dismissed the action on June 25, 2024, with
the court retaining jurisdiction pursuant to Civil Procedure Section 664.6.
II.    
ARGUMENTS
      Plaintiffs
argue that Defendant’s deadline to tender the settlement check was June 17,
2024. Plaintiffs have inquired with defense counsel on numerous occasions, but
Defendant has not complied with the settlement agreement. There is no issue
with surrendering the vehicle since it was repossessed before the case settled.
Plaintiffs are entitled to attorney’s fees pursuant to the terms of settlement.

      Defendant
argues that it has encountered unavoidable delays due to the late receipt of
necessary documents from Plaintiff. On May 3, 2024, Defendant requested that
Plaintiffs send a W-9 and pay-off quote for the vehicle. Defendant was unable
to open the documents and did receive Plaintiffs’ W-9  until June 17, 2024, when Plaintiffs resent
the documents. Defendant requires four to six weeks to process the settlement
check. Plaintiffs’ former counsel has a lien on the judgment which must be
resolved before the issuance of settlement funds. Plaintiffs are not entitled
to post-judgment interest because a judgment has not been issued. 
      In
reply, Plaintiffs argue that Defendant waited 45 days to request the W-9 form, and
there was no issue pertaining to its readability. For the first time, Defendant
conditions payment upon resolution of prior counsel’s lien but cites no
authority requiring that it be resolved prior to issuing payment. 
 
III.   
LEGAL STANDARDS
      A
party can move for entry of judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 664.6.) The court’s power is limited to determining the
existence of the agreement and to enforce its settlement. (Corkland
v. Boscoe (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 989, 994.) The court may receive
oral testimony or may determine the motion upon declarations alone. (Id.) 
      The
court applies general contract principles when interpreting a settlement
agreement. 
(Leeman v. Adams Extract & Spice, LLC (2015) 236
Cal.App.4th 1367, 1374.)The mutual intent of the parties
and interpretation of the contract are based on the language of the agreement
alone. (Id.) In construing a contract, "it
is not a court's prerogative to alter it, to rewrite its clear terms, or to
make a new contract for the parties."(Moss
Dev. Co. v. Geary (1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 1, 9.)

IV.   DISCUSSION
      Plaintiffs signed
an offer of compromise made by Defendant on May 2, 2024. (Plaintiff’s
Ex. A.) Defendant agreed to pay $18,537.60 within 45 days of acceptance,
buy out the lease, and pay any other residual amount to take title to the
vehicle from the lienholder. (Id. ¶ 2.) Defendant also agreed
to pay Plaintiffs’ costs, expenses, and attorney’s fees as provided by statute.
(Id. ¶ 3.) The parties agreed that the court would
retain jurisdiction to enforce settlement. (Id. ¶ 4.)

      Defendant failed
to comply with its agreement to tender settlement funds within 45 days of
acceptance. The terms of settlement do not require Plaintiffs to resolve its
contractual lien with prior counsel before Defendant issues the check, nor has
Defendant cited any authority that precludes its tender of settlement upon
resolution of Plaintiffs’ lien with prior counsel. 
      Plaintiffs’ prior counsel filed its Notice
of Lien which arose pursuant to its fee agreement with Plaintiffs. (Defendant’s
Ex. A, pp. 9.) As such, it is a matter of contract between attorney and
client and "must be resolved as between those contracting parties.” (Aresh
v. Marin-Morales (2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 296, 304; Mojtahedi
v. Vargas (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 974, 977–978 ["It is well
established that ‘[a]fter the client obtains a judgment, the attorney must
bring a separate, independent action against the client to establish the
existence of the lien, to determine the amount of the lien, and to enforce
it."].) Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to a judgment pursuant to the
settlement agreement. 
      Plaintiffs have not established why the
judgment should include 10 percent interest or how the amount should be
calculated. The settlement agreement does not provide for recovery of interest
in the event of Defendant’s delay in payment. Accordingly, the court strikes
the proposed order requesting interest (Prop.
Ord. 2:1-2.)
      The parties’ settlement agreement does not
provide for recovery of fees incurred to enforce the settlement. However, as
prevailing parties, Plaintiffs are entitled to statutory attorney’s fees that
were reasonably incurred “in connection with the commencement and prosecution
of such action.” (Civ.
Code, § 1794 subd.(d).) Accordingly, the court will consider fees and costs
incurred here as part of Plaintiffs’ fee motion. 
 
V.    
CONCLUSION
      Based on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ motion
is GRANTED. The court enters judgment pursuant to the parties’ settlement
agreement.
