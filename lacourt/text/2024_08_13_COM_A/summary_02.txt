And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to substitute PHH Mortgage Corporation as the plaintiff in this case. The plaintiff, Mortgage Assets Management, LLC, is seeking to have PHH Mortgage Corporation take its place as the plaintiff because the beneficial interest in the 2006 deed of trust has been assigned to PHH. The judge has determined that the motion is granted because the assignment of the deed of trust to PHH was recorded on April 28, 2024, and the action will continue in the name of PHH Mortgage Corporation as the plaintiff.
