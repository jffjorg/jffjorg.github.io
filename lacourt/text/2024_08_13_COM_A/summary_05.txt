As for the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling continuing the hearing on the plaintiffs' request for court judgment against Defendant Mark Hickman to October 8, 2024. The judge has found that the plaintiffs' request is defective and needs to be cured. Specifically, the plaintiffs have not properly served Defendant Hickman with the Statement of Damages, and the court cannot issue a judgment of default against him. The judge has also found that the plaintiffs have not provided sufficient evidence to support their damages claim, including the loss of the decedent's financial support, services, training, and advice, and the pecuniary value of the decedent's society and companionship. The judge has ordered the plaintiffs to submit an amended request for court judgment 10 days before the hearing, supported by evidence that cures the foregoing defects.
