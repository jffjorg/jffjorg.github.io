[TENTATIVE]
ORDER OVERRULING DEMURRER BY CROSS-DEFENDANT, CITY OF COMPTON, TO THE
CROSS-COMPLAINT FILED BY GUANDA, LLC
 
I.       
BACKGROUND
       The
complaint alleges that Plaintiff slipped and fell on an uneven sidewalk.
Plaintiff alleges claims for negligence and premises liability. On January 9,
2024, Defendant, Guanda, LLC (“Guanda”), filed a cross-complaint for indemnity,
declaratory relief, contribution, and apportionment against the City of Compton
(“Cross-Defendant” or “City”). On May 1, 2024, the City of Compton filed a
cross-complaint for indemnity and contribution against Cross-Defendant Guanda,
LLC. 
       Cross-Defendant
City demurs to all claims alleged in the Guanda cross-complaint as they are
barred by Guanda’s failure to submit a timely claim in compliance with the
Government Claims Act (“GCA.”) The claims are now time barred. Guanda did not
allege a basis for a duty allegedly owed by City to indemnify Guanda for injuries
sustained by Plaintiff, or a basis for contribution, apportionment, or
declaratory relief in the event of a judgment against Guanda.
       Cross-Complainant
Guanda did not file an opposition by Wednesday, July 31, 2024 (nine court days
of the hearing.) Code Civ. Proc., § 1005 (b).
II.      LEGAL
STANDARDS
       A demurrer tests the sufficiency of the
pleading as a matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt
v. Foundation Health (1995) 35
Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.) In testing its sufficiency, the court must assume the
truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual allegations; (2) facts that can be
reasonably inferred from those expressly pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed
matters. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.) The Court may not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions
of fact or law. (Moore
v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.4th
634, 638.) The Cross-Complainant must show that the pleading alleges facts
sufficient to establish every element of each cause of action. (Rakestraw
v. California Physicians Service
(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) Where the pleading fails to state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(e); Zelig
v. County of Los Angeles
(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1112, 1126.) 
       Sufficient facts are the essential facts of the case stated
with reasonable precision to acquaint the Cross-Defendant with the nature,
source, and extent of the alleged cause of action.” (Gressley
v. Williams (1961) 193
Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.) A demurrer may be sustained based on uncertainty,
where the factual allegations are so confusing, they do not sufficiently
apprise an opposing party of the issues it is being asked to meet. (Williams
v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2; Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.10(f).)
       A pleading is required to assert general allegations of
ultimate fact. Evidentiary facts are not required. (Quelimane
Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co.
(1998) 19 Cal. 4th 26, 47; Lim
v. The.TV Corp. Internat. (2002) 99 Cal. App. 4th 684, 690.) 
 
III.   
DISCUSSION
A.      The City has not established that Guanda failed to timely present a
claim to the City under the GCA.
       A party cannot commence an action for
money or damages against a public entity unless it first presents a timely
claim to the public entity. (Gov. Code, § 945.4.) A “public entity” “includes the state, the Regents
of the University of California, the Trustees of the California State
University and the California State University, a county, city, district,
public authority, public agency, and any other political subdivision or public
corporation in the State. (Gov. Code, § 811.2.)
       The City argues incorrectly that
presentation of a claim is “a condition precedent to the maintenance of any
cause of action against a public entity.” (Dem. 10:24-5.) A claim for
declaratory relief does not require compliance with the GCA. “[O]nly claimants
seeking money or damages, as distinguished from other types of judicial relief,
are required to conform to the claims procedure.”  (Minsky v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 11
Cal.3d 113, 121, quoting Van Alstyne, California Governmental Tort Liability (1964),
§§ 8.8-8.9, p 363–365.) The claims
statutes do not “impose any . . . requirements for non-pecuniary actions, such
as those seeking injunctive,12 specific, or declaratory13
relief.” (Id.)  Thus, the
claim for declaratory relief is exempt from the GCA.  
       However, where the cross claims for equitable indemnity,
contribution, and apportionment are based on facts beyond those alleged in the
City’s answer, compliance may be necessary as a new investigation of the facts is
required. (Southern
California Edison Co. v. City of Victorville (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 218, 239.)
The cross-complaint alleges that Guanda gave timely written notice of its claim
to the City on January 8, 2024 although the City contends it was due on September
14, 2023, one year after the date Plaintiff allegedly suffered injury. (Cross-complaint,
¶ 7; Dem. 11:5-9.)  
       The deadline for presenting a claim for a cause of action
other than death or injury to a person is no later than one year after the
accrual of the cause of action. (Gov. Code, § 911.2.) "[F]or statute of limitations purposes, the
defendant's indemnity action does not accrue until he has suffered actual loss
through payment." (Valley
Circle Estates v. VTN Consolidated, Inc.
(1983) 33 Cal.3d 604, 612.)
Accordingly, Defendant has not established that Guanda’s cross-complaint is
time barred. 
 
B.     
The claim for equitable
indemnity claim is adequately alleged. 
       The principle behind equitable indemnity is to allocate loss
among multiple tortfeasors on a comparative fault basis. (BFGC
Architects Planners, Inc. v. Forcum/Mackey Construction, Inc. (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 848, 852 ["The doctrine applies only among defendants
who are jointly and severally liable to the plaintiff."].) There must be
some basis for tort liability against the proposed indemnitor (ReCon). (Id.)

       The City’s duty to indemnify Guanda may arise “when in equity
and good conscience” the burden of judgment in Plaintiff’s favor should be
lifted from Guanda and imposed on the City, the Cross-Defendant, alleged in the
complaint to be a joint tortfeasor.  (Fireman’s
Fund Ins Co. v. Haslam (1994) 29
Cal.App.4th 1347, 1353-1354.) The right
depends on the principle that everyone is responsible for the consequences of
his or her own wrong. (Id.). 
       To state an indemnity claim, the Cross-complaint must allege “(1)
a showing of fault on the part of the indemnitor [City] and (2) resulting
damages to the indemnitee [Guanda] for which the indemnitor is ... equitably
responsible." (Bailey
v. Safeway, Inc. (2011) 199
Cal.App.4th 206, 217.) Guanda alleges
that if Plaintiff proves damages, they were caused by the City’s primary and
active negligence and not by any active negligence on Guanda’s part. (Cross-complaint,
¶ 9.) Guanda adequately alleged a basis for the City’s duty to indemnify
arising from the City’s acts in causing Plaintiff’s injuries. The City’s
“actual fault” is alleged and is adequate under 
Bailey. (Id.
at 217.) Moreover, to
the extent the City alleges that Guanda failed to allege facts to support the
City’s fault, Guanda incorporated the facts alleged in the complaint and
attached the complaint to the cross-complaint. (Cross-complaint, ¶ 6, Ex. A.)
 
C.     
Demurrer to the
implied indemnity claim lacks merit.
       Generally, the duty to indemnify may be expressly provided by
contract, implied from a contract not specifically mentioning indemnity, or it
may arise from the equities of a particular situation. (Bear
Creek Planning Com. v. Title Ins. & Trust Co. (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 1227, 1237.) Guanda did not allege a basis for implying a
duty to indemnify other than that the  Plaintiff’s
injuries were caused solely by the City. (Cross-complaint, ¶ 12.) Thus, this
claim is based on the same facts to support equitable indemnity and is
duplicative as it asserts no other basis from which the duty can be implied.  The City, however, did not demur on this
ground, and has not shown how that duplication causes prejudice. (Dale
v. City of Mountain View (1976) 55
Cal.App.3d 101, 105 ["The court
must in every stage of an action disregard any defect in the pleadings that
does not affect the substantial rights of the parties."].) 
 
D.    
The claim for declaratory
is adequately stated. 
       The claim for declaratory relief seeks a judicial
determination of the Cross-Defendant’s duties and obligations to defend and
indemnify Guanda for the alleged misconduct. A claim for declaratory relief is
sufficient “if it sets forth facts showing the existence of an actual
controversy relating to the legal rights and duties of the respective parties.”
(Condor Ins. Co. v.
Williamsburg Nat. Ins. Co. (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 554, 565.) As this claim is “wholly derivative”  of the first cause of action for equitable indemnity,
the declaratory relief claim adequately states a basis for a declaration of
rights. (Ball v. FleetBoston Financial
Corp.
(2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 794, 800.)
 
E.     
Contribution is adequately stated. 
       In contrast to indemnity
claims, a claim for contribution “distributes the loss equally among all
tortfeasors, each bearing his pro rata share. (E. W. Bliss Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1254, 1261.) The City argues Guanda did
not allege facts regarding the City’s obligation to reimburse Guanda if found
liable for Plaintiff’s injuries. (Dem. 10:7-9.)  The City reads this portion in isolation. The
Cross-Complainant should be read as a whole and is sufficient if it apprises
the City of the basis for the claims against it. (Lim v. The.TV Corp. Internat. (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 684,
690.)
The cross-complaint, which incorporates facts alleged in the complaint, is
adequately stated under this standard. 
 
IV.    CONCLUSION
       Based on the foregoing,
Cross-Defendant’s Demurrer to the Cross-Complainant is OVERRULED.
Cross-Defendant is ordered to file and serve its answer forthwith.
