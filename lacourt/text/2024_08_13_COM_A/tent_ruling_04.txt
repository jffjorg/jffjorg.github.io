 Case Number:  23CMCV00339    Hearing Date:   August 13, 2024    Dept:  A  23CMCV00339 Levivian Beatrice Valencia   individually and as Successor-in-Interest to Cuca Bry Anna Mona Perryman v.   State of California, et al. Tuesday,   August 13, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  [TENTATIVE] ORDER  GRANTING DEFENDANT, COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES’, MOTION TO DEEM FACTS ADMITTED       [TENTATIVE] ORDER  GRANTING DEFENDANT, COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES’, MOTION TO DEEM FACTS ADMITTED           On  February 9, 2024, Defendant, County of Los Angeles (“County”) served requests  for admission, set one, on Plaintiff at her address at 7914 Midhurst Dr., #25,  Highland, CA, as Plaintiff is self-represented.  County telephoned Plaintiff to about the  requests for admission, but Plaintiff has not responded, nor has she filed a  dismissal against County, who maintains it had no involvement with the road  design at issue. (Gary A. Bacio Decl., ¶ 4.        Where  a party fails to respond to requests for admission, the court can deem the  requests admitted against the non-responding party unless it finds that the  non-responding party has subsequently served, before the hearing, a proposed  response to the requests that substantially complies with statutory  requirements. (Code  Civ. Proc., § 2033.280 subd. (c).)        The  court’s file does not reflect that Plaintiff opposed the motion nine court days  before the hearing or otherwise informed the court that Plaintiff served  responses to the requests for admission. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005 (b).)        Accordingly,  the County’s motion is GRANTED. The requests served on Plaintiff on February 9,  2024, are deemed admitted. As the County did not request imposition of  sanctions, none is awarded.
