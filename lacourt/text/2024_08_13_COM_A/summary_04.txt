And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the County of Los Angeles' motion to deem facts admitted. The County served requests for admission on the plaintiff, Levivian Beatrice Valencia, on February 9, 2024, but the plaintiff failed to respond. The County telephoned the plaintiff to inquire about the responses, but the plaintiff did not respond. The judge ruled that the requests for admission are deemed admitted against the plaintiff because she failed to respond. The judge did not award any sanctions against the plaintiff. The ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 2033.280 and 1005, which state that a party that fails to respond to requests for admission can have the requests deemed admitted unless a subsequent response is served before the hearing.
