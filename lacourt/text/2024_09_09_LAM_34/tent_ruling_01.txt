  Case Number:  23STCV15657    Hearing Date:   September 9, 2024    Dept:  34 Nave v. Bremont, et al. (23STCV15657)
 
1.    
Defendants Matthew Lane Bremont and Sweet James,
LLP’s Demurrer to First Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED without leave to amend. 
 
 
Background
 
On July 6, 2023,
Plaintiff Anita Jo Nave (“Plaintiff”), in pro per, filed a complaint alleging
malpractice against Defendants Matthew Lane Bremont and Sweet James LLC
(together “Defendants”), alleging the following:
 
“Matthew Lane Bremont’s
ineffective assistance of counsel, which included not contacting me in over
10-12 months to discuss my case and his unethical disposition as my lawyer
along with his abuse of power which led me to mental duress caused me to file
this lawsuit. I am a 65 year old person with many disabilities. Mental and
Physical.”
 
(Complaint, p. 1.)
On March 1, 2024,
Defendants filed a Demurrer to the Complaint, which the Court sustained with
leave to amend on April 10, 2024. The Notice of Ruling on the Demurrer was
filed and served by both mail and electronic service on April 12, 2024.
 
On May 8, 2024, and
May 9, 2024, Plaintiff served and filed, respectively, an Opposition to the Demurrer
and a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) by first-class mail on Defendants. In the
FAC, Plaintiff made the following additional allegations:
 
“Matthew Lane
Bremont did not communicate with me as an attorney should with his client. He
was dishonest about being an attorney for seven years when it had only been
five years. I checked with CSBA. His admission date was 12-2016. I don’t know
why he was being dishonest about that.
 
Mathew Lane Bremont
was again dishonest when he said that he had spoken or discussed with me about
not receiving therapy or treatment anymore. He never mentioned anything to me.
As a matter of fact, it was Kiana Vahid that spoke to me about using my own
health insurance until they figured out a way to pay the doctor’s bills. Not
Matthew Lane Bremont, because I didn’t even know of him at the time.
 
The lies and being
dishonest is a breach of contract in CCC-3300, California Civil Code. 
 
Also, Matthew Lane
Bremont’s unethical disposition as my attorney did not contact me in a period
of 10-12 months. Professional Disconduct, Rule 1-300.
 
His abuse of power
as an attorney was that Matthew Lane Bremont willfully delayed the lawsuit with
the view of his own gain. He said, and I quote, I want to get paid, which
included not informing me that the other party, which was AAA Insurance
Company, was ready to settle in May of 2021. Instead, Matthew Lane Bremont
prolonged the lawsuit for his own satisfaction, especially when he knew it was
an open and shut case. I was not at fault.
 
Matthew Lane
Bremont’s abuse of power led me to mental, physical, and emotional duress. All
the lies and verbal negative abuse is what caused me to file this lawsuit.”
 
Plaintiff also
attached an Exhibit A showing a forwarded email thread from Plaintiff to drrosie@aol.com on April 9, 2024 from March
4, 2023, and an original message from kianava@sweetjames.com
to Plaintiff on January 18, 2021 asking Plaintiff to send a photo of
declarations, and a January 22, 2021, message from kianava@sweetjames.com to Plaintiff
including recommendations to three physical therapy and MRI facilities, asking
Plaintiff to “Please go through your health insurance to schedule your
appointments until we figure out liability.”.
 
(FAC, pp. 1-2,
Exhibit A.)
 
On June 12, 2024, following
unsuccessful meet and confer efforts, Defendants filed a Demurrer to the FAC in
its entirety, concurrently with a request for judicial notice and proof of
service and supporting declarations.
 
On July 5, 2024, the
hearing on Defendant’s Demurrer without Motion to Strike the FAC, previously
set for July 18, 2024, was continued to September 9, 2024.
 
On July 30, 2024, the
case was reassigned from Judge Michael P. Linfield to Judge Peter A. Hernandez.

 
On July 31, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) for Legal Malpractice
against Defendants alleging as follows, and attaching exhibits A, B, C, and D.
 
“Matthew Lane
Bremont, Sweet James, LLP are not the law firm they say they are. Matthew Lane
Bremont, Sweet James, LLP are liars, cheaters, and disrespectful. They took my
money and never got me a settlement.”
 
(SAC, p. 1.) 
 
Exhibit A contains
letters from Plaintiff to Judge Linfield;
 
Exhibit B contains
a summary of Plaintiff’s legal charges;
 
Exhibit C contains 14
customer reviews filed with the Better Business Bureau against Defendant Sweet
James LLP and a letter dated May 26, 2021, from the Interinsurance Exchange of
the Automobile Club regarding a settlement of $30,000 on the insurance policy
of Romeo Hamrick for Claimants Anita Nave, Darren Kendrix, Aliah Hansan, and
Evadney Nicholson, and a letter from State Farm to Plaintiff regarding the
insurance policy of Altheia Mitchell asking Plaintiff to call State Farm and
provide a declaration to support their investigation.
 
Exhibit D contains
Plaintiff’s mental health diagnoses and psychiatric evaluation notes.
 
(SAC, Exhibits
A-D.)
 
            On
August 30, 2024, Defendants filed a Reply to the Demurrer to the FAC
concurrently with a declaration. 
 
            The
hearing on this motion is scheduled for September 9, 2024.
 
1.              
Defendants Bremont & Sweet James, LLP’s
Demurrer 
 
Meet and Confer
 
On review
of the Declaration of Madison R. Kneadler, the Court notes that Defendant has
satisfied its meet and confer obligation prior to filing the instant motion, as
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), and section 435.5,
subdivision (a), require meeting and conferring “in person or by telephone.” On
June 3, 2024, Defense Counsel Kneadler emailed Plaintiff requesting a phone
call to meet and confer. (Kneadler Decl., ¶ 6.) Attorney Kneadler followed up
with Plaintiff by mail and by email thereafter. (Id., ¶¶ 7-8.) On June 6,
2024, Defense counsel and Irean Z. Swan, a shareholder of Defendant Sweet
James, LLP discussed the merits of this demurrer by telephone. (Kneadler Decl.
¶ 9.)
 
 
Timeliness
 
All opposition papers must be
served on the demurring party and filed with the court at least 9 court days
before the hearing. (CCP § 1005(b).)


Plaintiff has failed to file a
timely Opposition on Defendants by filing her Opposition 27 calendar days after
the Court posted its Notice of Ruling on the Demurrer. Plaintiff’s Opposition challenges
the service of the Demurrer, and the effectiveness of parties’ prior meet and
confer effort on February 29, 2024.
 
Plaintiff’s Opposition to
Defendant’s Demurrer to the original Complaint is untimely filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
A
demurrer may be made on the grounds that the pleading, inter alia, does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and/or is uncertain.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subds. (e) and (f).) 
 
When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of
the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A
demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the
pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984)
153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905 [citations omitted].) At the pleading stage, a
plaintiff need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant
of the factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28 Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) “[A] demurrer
does not, however, admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law
alleged in the pleading, or the construction placed on an instrument pleaded
therein, or facts impossible in law, or allegations contrary to facts of which
a court may take judicial knowledge.” (S.
Shore Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732 [citations
omitted].) 
 
Discussion 
 
Defendants demur, pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure § 430.10, subdivisions (e) and (f), to the entirety of
Plaintiff’s FAC, on the basis that it fails to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action and is uncertain.  
 
“To state a cause of action for
legal malpractice, a plaintiff must plead (1) the duty of the attorney to use
such skill, prudence, and diligence as members of his or her profession
commonly possess and exercise; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a proximate
causal connection between the breach and the resulting injury; and (4) actual
loss or damage resulting from the attorney’s negligence.” (Kumaraperu v.
Feldsted (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 60, 66, quotation marks omitted.)
 
Plaintiff has alleged that
Defendant Bremont “did not communicate with [her] as an attorney should with
his client” and Defendant Bremont’s “unethical disposition as [her] attorney
did not contact [her] in a period of 10-12 months. Professional Disconduct,
Rule 1-300.” (FAC, p. 1:16-19, 2:1-11.) Plaintiff has also alleged that
Defendant Bremont was dishonest about the length of his legal experience,
claiming seven years of experience, but Plaintiff does not allege when this
statement was allegedly made, given that the FAC was filed on May 9, 2024. The
Court notes that Defendant Bremont has been actively admitted to the State Bar
of California since December 2016, nearly eight years ago. Plaintiff also fails
to allege how this alleged misrepresentation was material to her resulting
injury. 
 
Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant
Breman willfully delayed the progress of her lawsuit when he failed to inform
her of AAA Insurance Company’s willingness to settle the presumable personal
injury matter in May 2021. (FAC, p. 2:15-19.) Plaintiff fails to sufficiently state
a factual basis for the proximate causal connection between Defendants’ conduct
and her resulting injury, alleging only that Defendant Bremont’s “abuse of
power led me to mental, physical, and emotional duress. All the lies and verbal
negative abuse is what caused me to file this lawsuit.” (Id., p.
2:24-28.)
 
While a party may choose to act as
his or her own attorney, “ ‘such a party is to be treated like any other party
and is entitled to the same, but no greater consideration than other litigants
and attorneys. [Citation.]’ [Citation.] Thus, as is the case with attorneys,
[self-represented] litigants must follow correct rules of procedure.
[Citations.]” (Nwosu v. Uba (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1229, 1246–1247, 19
Cal.Rptr.3d 416; Stebley v. Litton Loan Servicing, LLP (2011) 202
Cal.App.4th 522, 524, 134 Cal.Rptr.3d 604 [“Although plaintiffs appear in this
court without counsel, that does not entitle them to special treatment”]; ViaView,
Inc. v. Retzlaff (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 198, 208.) 
 
As confusing as Plaintiff’s FAC is,
at a minimum, Plaintiff has not factually alleged how Defendants Bretman and
Sweet James LLP purportedly breached their professional obligations to her.
Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s FAC, then, is sustained without leave to
amend.
 
What Plaintiff lacks in allegations
against Defendants would not be cured by allowing leave to amend at this time.
 
2.    
Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint
 
In Reply to the Demurrer to the
FAC, Defendants request the Court strike Plaintiff’s SAC because it was filed
without leave of the Court, without a stipulation between the parties, and
never served on Defendants. (Reply, p. 3:4-15; Declaration of Madison Kneadler,
¶¶ 4-5.)
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (a)(1), “[t]he court may, in furtherance of justice, and on
any terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading.”  Amendment may be allowed at any time before
or after commencement of trial. (Code Civ. Proc., § 576.) “[T]he court’s
discretion will usually be exercised liberally to permit amendment of the
pleadings. The policy favoring amendment is so strong that it is a rare case in
which denial of leave to amend can be justified.” (Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184
Cal.App.4th 1422, 1428 (internal citations omitted).) “If the motion to amend
is timely made and the granting of the motion will not prejudice the opposing
party, it is error to refuse permission to amend….”  (Morgan v. Sup. Ct. (1959) 172
Cal.App.2d 527, 530.) Prejudice includes “delay in trial, loss of critical
evidence, or added costs of preparation.” (Solit v. Tokai Bank, Ltd. New
York Branch (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1448.) 
 
A motion to amend a pleading before trial must
include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading, which must be
serially numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments.
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(a).) The motion must also state what
allegations are proposed to be deleted or added, by page, paragraph, and line
number.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1324(a).) Finally, a separate supporting declaration specifying the effect of
the amendment, why the amendment is necessary and proper, when the facts giving
rise to the amended allegations were discovered, and the reason the request for
amendment was not made earlier must also accompany the motion. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.134(b).) 
 
On July 31, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”) for Legal Malpractice against
Defendants. There is no indication that Plaintiff sought leave to amend the FAC
prior to the filing of the SAC. Although Plaintiff has attached four new
exhibits to corroborate the allegations against Defendants, Plaintiff has not
followed the adequate procedures requiring first seeking permission from the
Court to file an amendment to the FAC, or reached a mutual agreement with
Defendants. 
            
            Accordingly,
the Court strikes Plaintiff’s SAC.
