Summary:
The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the plaintiff's first amended complaint without leave to amend, and strikes the plaintiff's second amended complaint. The ruling holds that the plaintiff's allegations of legal malpractice fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and are uncertain. The court also notes that the plaintiff has not followed proper procedures for amending the complaint.
