And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to compel further responses to interrogatories filed by Keolis Transit America, Inc. (Doe 1). The motion was filed on September 7, 2023, seeking an order compelling Plaintiff Phyllis R. Ginolfi, through her Conservator Christin C. Solis, to provide further responses to Keolis' Form Interrogatories, Set 1, Nos. 6.4, 6.6, 6.7, and 9.2. Additionally, Keolis requested sanctions against Plaintiff and her attorney, Steven C. Gambardella, in the amount of $1,800.00.

The judge found that Plaintiff's responses to the interrogatories were incomplete and evasive, and that Plaintiff waived the right to exercise the option to produce writing under CCP 2030.230. The judge ordered that further responses are due within 15 days, and that sanctions are payable within 15 days.

The judge reduced the requested sanctions from $1,800.00 to $900.00, based on the time spent preparing the motion and responding to the hearing. The judge concluded that Keolis is entitled to an award of sanctions against Plaintiff and her attorney for their failure to comply with their discovery obligations.
