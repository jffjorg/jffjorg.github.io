SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
On 6/7/21, Plaintiff Phyllis R. Ginolfi, by and through
her Conservator, Christin C. Solis (Plaintiff) filed this action against Right
Choice In-Home Care, Inc. and GMA Management Group, Inc. dba Pacoima Adult Day
Care for dependent adult/elder abuse and negligence.  On 3/15/23, Plaintiff filed a Doe Amendment
naming Defendant Keolis Transit America, Inc. as Doe 1 (Keolis).
 
On 6/1/23, Keolis served the subject discovery on
Plaintiff.  (Tran Decl.).  Plaintiff failed to provide timely
responses.  Id.  On 7/24/23, Plaintiff served responses which
Keolis deemed to be deficient.  Id.  After meet and confer efforts failed to
resolve the issues Keolis had with the responses, on 9/7/23, Keolis filed and
served the instant motion seeking an order compelling Plaintiff to provide
further responses to Keolis’ Form Interrogatories, Set 1, Nos. 6.4, 6.6, 6.7
and 9.2.  Additionally, Keolis requests
sanctions against Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s counsel, Steven C. Gambardella, in the amount of $1,800.00.  Id. 
Plaintiff has not opposed or otherwise responded to the motion.
 
ANALYSIS
 
CCP 2030.220 provides: 
 
“(a) Each answer in a response to
interrogatories shall be as complete and straightforward as the information
reasonably available to the responding party permits.
(b) If an interrogatory cannot be
answered completely, it shall be answered to the extent possible.
(c) If the responding party does
not have personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory,
that party shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to
obtain the information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations,
except where the information is equally available to the propounding party.”
 
Responses to interrogatories are due within 30 days after
service of the interrogatories.  CCP
2030.260(a).
 
CCP 2030.290 provides, in relevant part:
 
“If a party to whom interrogatories
are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following rules apply:
(a) The party to whom the
interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the option to produce
writings under Section
2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with Section
2018.010). . . .”
 
Upon receipt of responses to interrogatories, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling further responses if the
propounding party deems that an answer is evasive or incomplete.  CCP 2030.300(a).  
 
Plaintiff’s 7/24/23 responses to the interrogatories
served on 6/1/23 were untimely. 
Therefore, Plaintiff waived the right to exercise the option to produce
writing under CCP 2030.230 as Plaintiff has done in response to Form
Interrogatories 6.4, 6.6 and 6.7.  As
such, Plaintiff’s responses to these interrogatories are incomplete and
evasive.  Similarly, Plaintiff has failed
to answer the question asked in Form Interrogatory 9.2 making the response
incomplete and evasive.  
 
Keolis is entitled to an award of sanctions against
Plaintiff and her attorney, Steven C. Gambardella, for their failure to comply
with their discovery obligations.  CCP
2023.010(h), (i); CCP 2023.030; 2030.300(d). 
However, the sanctions requested, $1,800.00, are reduced to $900.00 (1 hour
to prepare the motion + 1 hour to prepare the separate statement + ½ hour to
prepare for the hearing + ½ hour to appear = 3 hours multiplied by
$300/hour).   
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted. 
Further responses are due and sanctions are payable within 15 days.
