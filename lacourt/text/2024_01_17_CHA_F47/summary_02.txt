And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling of this case is that the motion to strike paragraph 14.a. of the complaint, which seeks to strike the prayer for punitive damages, is granted without leave to amend. The motion was filed by the defendants, Jose Servin, Jr., Jesus Avila, and Estela Avila, and seeks to strike the prayer for punitive damages based on the lack of evidence to support a claim for punitive damages. The court finds that the allegations in the complaint are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages, as they do not establish that any of the defendants had the requisite evil motive and/or knowledge of the probable dangerous consequences of their actions in this negligence-based action. The court also notes that the plaintiffs have not opposed the motion or otherwise indicated that they have additional facts to support a claim for punitive damages against the defendants. As such, the court finds that the motion is granted without leave to amend.
