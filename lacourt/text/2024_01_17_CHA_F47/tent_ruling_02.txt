SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of motor vehicle accident that
occurred on 8/12/22.  Plaintiffs Ka Hyun
Kim, Hazel Kim and Iris Kim (Plaintiffs) allege that Defendant Jose Servin, Jr.
(Servin) operated the vehicle involved in the accident and that the vehicle was
owed by Defendants Jesus Avila and Estela Avila (the Avilas).  
 
On 10/12/23, Plaintiffs filed this action against Servin
and the Avilas (collectively, Defendants) 
for: (1) Motor Vehicle – Negligence and (2) General Negligence.  Plaintiffs also request punitive damages in
their complaint.  Plaintiffs’ counsel did
not respond to Defendants’ counsel’s meet and confer efforts regarding the
issues presented by this motion.  (See
Dondanville Decl.).  Therefore, on
11/27/23, Defendants filed and served the instant motion seeking an order striking
paragraph 14.a. of the complaint which is the prayer for punitive damages.  Plaintiffs have not opposed or otherwise
responded to the motion.  
 
ANALYSIS 

 
Punitive damages may be awarded upon a showing by clear
and convincing evidence that the defendant is guilty of oppression, fraud or
malice.  Civil Code 3294(a).  Civil Code 3294 defines malice as “conduct
which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or
despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.”  Civil Code 3294(c)(1).  The statute defines oppression as “despicable
conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious
disregard of that person's rights” and fraud as “an intentional
misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known to the
defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving
a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.”  Civil Code 3294(c)(2).
 
Here, Plaintiffs have alleged that the Avilas negligently
entrusted their vehicle to Servin who allegedly ran a red light causing a
collision with Plaintiffs’ vehicle. 
Plaintiffs further allege that Servin then fled the scene with his
passengers.  
 
Such allegations are insufficient to support a claim for
punitive damages.  The complaint does not
allege facts to establish that any of the Defendants had the requisite evil
motive and/or knowledge of the probable dangerous consequences of their actions
in this negligence-based action.  See
Civil Code 3294; Taylor (1979) 24 C3d 890; Kendall Yacht Corp.
(1975) 50 CA3d 949; Dawes (1980) 111 CA3d 82, 89.  Unreasonable, careless, grossly negligent and
even reckless conduct, alone, is insufficient to support a claim for punitive
damages.  G.D. Searle & Co.
(1975) 49 CA3d 22; Lackner (2006) 135 CA4th 1188.
 
As noted above, Plaintiffs have not opposed the motion or
otherwise indicated that they have additional facts to support a claim for
punitive damages against Defendants.  As
such, Plaintiffs have failed to establish that leave to amend is warranted
under the circumstances.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion to strike is granted without leave to
amend.  Answer is due within 15
days.
