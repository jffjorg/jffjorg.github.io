PARTY: Defendants EMS Solutions, LLC and Hussain BhamaniTENTATIVE RULING Plaintiff City of Calabasas; Motion for Preliminary Injunction is GRANTED pursuant to CCP §§ 526–527, and Calabasas Muni. Code §§ 1.16.030, 8.28.200(A)(2), and 15.04.840(A). Plaintiff establishes a reasonable probability of prevailing on their nuisance per se claim, which creates a rebuttable presumption arises that the potential harm to the public outweighs the potential harm to the defendant. Defendant does not meet their burden of showing grave or irreparable harm other than possible financial harm. Plaintiff is not required to post an undertaking as a governmental entity pursuant to CCP § 529. Plaintiff City of Calabasas’ RJN is GRANTED. The preliminary injunction enjoins Defendants, and their agents, employees, servants, successors, or assigns, or anyone acting on their behalf or in concert with them, from: 1. Using, occupying, maintaining, or permitting the maintenance of the Subject Properties in a manner that violates the Calabasas Municipal Code. 2. Constructing, enlarging, altering, repairing, moving, or demolishing any structure on the Subject Properties without complying with the Calabasas Municipal Code; and 3. Constructing, enlarging, altering, repairing, moving, or demolishing any structure on the Subject Properties without any required City-approved plans or City-issued permits  To secure full and timely compliance with this order, the Court further orders Defendants to:4. Within _________ calendar days of service of the Preliminary Injunction Order, submit all requisite applications, plans, supporting documents, and fees to the City’s Planning Division and Building & Safety Division to legalize, demolish, or restore the unlawful and substandard conditions that exist on the Subject Properties. 5. Within __________ calendar days of any City request for amended or supplemental information or documentation, submit said amended or supplemental information or documentation to the appropriate City division, if applicable. In the event the City rejects Defendants’ corrections submission three time, Defendants shall be deemed to have materially breached the injunction. 6. Within seven calendar days of City approval, obtain all required permits to remove or correct the unlawful and substandard conditions at the Subject Properties. 7. Within ____________ calendar days from permit issuance, commence any and all construction, demolition, grading, and any other work necessary to pursuant to the City-approved plans and City-issued permits to correct the unlawful and substandard conditions. This work shall continue on a day-to-day basis until all work is complete, except weekends and holidays. Any delay, postponement, or abandonment the work for more than three consecutive business days (excluding Sundays and holidays) shall constitute a material breach of the injunction. 8. Within __________ calendar days from permit issuance: (a) Complete all corrective actions pursuant to the City-approved plans and City-issued permits to correct the unlawful and substandard conditions. (b) Schedule and undergo a final City inspection to confirm completion with all corrective actions, and to finalize all permits authorizing the required corrective work.(Motion for PI, pp. 1:22–28–2:1–16.)Reasoning “A preliminary injunction may be granted at any time before judgment upon a verified complaint, or upon affidavits if the complaint in the one case, or the affidavits in the other, show satisfactorily that sufficient grounds exist therefor. No preliminary injunction shall be granted without notice to the opposing party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 527, subd. (a).) “An injunction may be granted . . . [w]hen it appears by the complaint or affidavits that the commission or continuance of some act during the litigation would produce waste, or great or irreparable injury, to a party to the action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 526, subd. (a)(2).)  Calabasas Municipal Code (“CMC”) § 1.16.030 authorizes the City of Calabasas to enforce any violation of the CMC by seeking a court injunction, including a preliminary injunction. (See CMC § 1.16.030.) “The district attorney, county counsel, or city attorney of any county or city in which the nuisance exists shall bring an action whenever directed by the board of supervisors of the county, or whenever directed by the legislative authority of the town or city. (Code Civ. Proc., § 731.) Traditionally, in deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction, a court must weigh two interrelated factors: (1) the likelihood that the moving party will ultimately prevail on the merits, and (2) the relative interim harm to the parties from issuance or non-issuance of the injunction.  (See Butt v. State of California, 4 Cal. 4th 668, 677-78 (1992); Alliant Ins. Services, Inc. v. Gaddy (2008) 159 Cal. App. 4th 1292, 1299.) “The trial court’s determination must be guided by a ‘mix’ of the potential-merit and interim-harm factors; the greater the plaintiff's showing on one, the less must be shown on the other to support an injunction.”  (Butt, supra, 4 Cal. 4th at p. 678.)   The general objective in issuing a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo.  (See Continental Baking Co. v. Katz (1968) 68 Cal.2d 512, 528.)  In addition, it is rarely appropriate to grant a preliminary injunction that not only does not preserve the status quo but also grants the ultimate relief sought in the action, before trial.  (See Paramount Pictures Corp. v. Davis (1965) 228 Cal.App.2d 827.  A preliminary injunction must not issue unless the plaintiff can demonstrate reasonable probability that he will prevail on the merits, regardless of the balancing of the hardships or the irreparable nature of the harm.  (See San Francisco Newspaper Printing Co. v. Superior Court (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 438, 442.) However, when an injunction is sought by a governmental entity, as here with the Plaintiff City of Calabasas (“the City”), the test for granting a preliminary injunction is more focused on the first prong, whether the governmental entity establishes a reasonably probability of prevailing on the merits: Where a governmental entity seeking to enjoin the alleged violation of an ordinance which specifically provides for injunctive relief establishes that it is reasonably probable it will prevail on the merits, a rebuttable presumption arises that the potential harm to the public outweighs the potential harm to the defendant. If the defendant shows that it would suffer grave or irreparable harm from the issuance of the preliminary injunction, the court must then examine the relative actual harms to the parties.Once the defendant has made such a showing, an injunction should issue only if—after consideration of both (1) the degree of certainty of the outcome on the merits, and (2) the consequences to each of the parties of granting or denying interim relief—the trial court concludes that an injunction is proper.  (IT Corp. v. County of Imperial (1983) 35 Cal.3d 63, 72.) “The ultimate goal of any test to be used in deciding whether a preliminary injunction should issue is to minimize the harm which an erroneous interim decision may cause.” (Id. at p. 73.)I. The City demonstrates it is reasonably probably they will prevail on its claim of nuisance per se.  “By ordinance the city legislative body may declare what constitutes a nuisance.” (Gov. Code, § 38771.) Gov. Code 38773.5 states the city’s “legislative body may by ordinance establish a procedure for the abatement of a nuisance and make the cost of abatement of a nuisance upon a parcel of land a special assessment against that parcel,” plus the city may provide for the recovery of attorney’s fees to the prevailing party. (Gov. Code 38773.5.) CMC § 1.16.130 states “the violation of any of the provisions of this Code or of any other ordinance of the city shall constitute a nuisance and may be abated by the city through civil process by means of a restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction, or in any other manner provided by law.” (Calabasas Muni. Code § 1.16.130.) “The concept of a nuisance per se arises when a legislative body with appropriate jurisdiction, in the exercise of the police power, expressly declares a particular object or substance, activity, or circumstance, to be a nuisance. (Beck Development Co. v. Southern Pacific Transportation Co. (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1160, 1206. “[W]here the law expressly declares something to be a nuisance, then no inquiry beyond its existence need be made and in this sense its mere existence is said to be a nuisance per se.” (Id., at p. 1207.) The City provides declarations to show 3533 Canon Drive and 3535 Canon Drive, in the City of Calabasas, California, and are further identified as Assessor Parcel Numbers 2072-025-013 and 2072-025-021 (“Subject Properties”) are currently owned by Defendant Hussain Bhamani (“Bhamani”), the manager of Defendant EMS Solutions, LLC (“EMS”). (RJN, ¶¶ 5–8, Ex. E–H; Cohen Decl., ¶ 39; Sanchez Decl., ¶ 5.) The City provides declarations from Building Official Cohen, Senior Building Inspector Flores, Senior Code Enforcement Officer Soria, Community Development Director Klein, and Planner Rackerby to show that the Subject Properties contain numerous CMC violations including:1. CMC § 8.20.040(A)(1)(a)–(b), (A)(5)(a), (c), (B)(3)–(4) (Soria Decl., ¶¶ 11–13, 15, 18.) 2. CMC § 15.04.100 (Soria Decl., ¶¶ 11–13, 15, 18; Flores Decl., ¶¶ 16–18, 19, 22, 24; Cohen Decl., ¶¶ 60–62, 68)3. CMC § 15.04.140 (Soria Decl., ¶¶ 11–13, 16, 18; Cohen Decl., ¶¶ 60–62, 68.)4. CMC § 17.20.100(B)(1) (See Flores Decl., ¶¶ 13, 14, 19, 22, 24.)5. CMC § 17.18.020(C) (See Flores Decl., ¶¶ 13, 14, 19, 22, 24.)6. CMC § 17.01.040 (See Flores Decl., ¶¶ 13, 14, 19, 22, 24.)7. Calabasas Residential Code § R105.1 (Cohen Decl., ¶¶ 60–62, 68.)The City shows these claims relate to:(i) the historical unpermitted alternation of the cabin and music room, (ii) the unpermitted masonry walls, (iii) the more recent unpermitted alterations and demolitions occurring on site after Bhamani took ownership, and (iv) the unlawful accumulations of debris presently on site.(Motion, pp. 13:24-28–14:1.) Thus, by identifying numerous violations of the CMC through declarations and evidence, the City has established a reasonable probability that they will prevail on the merits of their nuisance per se claim. Bhamani argues the City’s code enforcement amounts to a taking and cannot demonstrate it will prevail on the public nuisance claim. (Oppo, pp. 8–11.) The Court disagrees. Governmental entities, including the City, can use their “police power” to control the development and use of specific property within its jurisdiction if it’s “reasonably necessary to protect the order, safety, health, morals and general welfare of society.” (Freeman v. Contra Costa County Water District (1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 404, 408; cf. Hawthorne Savings & Loan Assn. v. City of Signal Hill (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 148, 159 [“‘A municipality in the exercise of its police power may, without compensation, destroy a building or structure that is a menace to the public safety or health’” without the action being considered a taking.’”].) A Taking can occur when a regulation goes “too far,” leaving “the owner of land without economically beneficial or productive options for its use—typically . . . by requiring land to be left substantially in its natural state.” (Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council (1992) 505 U.S. 1003, 1017.) “[T]he government must pay just compensation for such “total regulatory takings,” except to the extent that “background principles of nuisance and property law” independently restrict the owner's intended use of the property.’ [Citation.]” (Jefferson Street Ventures, LLC v. City of Indio (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1175, 1193.) “But government regulation of private property may, in some instances, be so onerous that its effect is tantamount to a direct appropriation or ouster and ... such regulatory takings' may be compensable under the Fifth Amendment.” (Allegretti & Co. v. County of Imperial (2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 1261, 1270, citing Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (2005) 544 U.S. 528, 537.)  However, “[c]ity legislative bodies are empowered by Government Code, section 38771 to declare what constitutes a nuisance. Since even without this section cities would have the power to abate public nuisances (Code Civ.Proc. s 731) and to impose criminal sanctions upon those maintaining public nuisances (Pen.Code, s 373a) it seems evident that Government Code section 38771 does more than permit cities to adopt as municipal ordinances provisions which have already been enacted as state statutes.” (City of Bakersfield v. Miller (1966) 64 Cal.2d 93, 100 [“City of Bakersfield has the power to define by statute the standards by which courts are to judge whether a nuisance exists, and the trial court did not err in refusing to decide this case on the basis of common law concepts or of the general provisions of Civil Code, section 3479.”] Thus, as analyzed above, the City has established a reasonably probability that they will prevail on a claim of nuisance per se, and the Court does not have to decide this issue based on common law nuisance principles at this stage in the case.  Therefore a “rebuttable presumption arises that the potential harm to the public outweighs the potential harm to the defendant.” (IT Corp., supra, 35 Cal.3d 63 at p. 72.). The burden now shifts to the Defendant to show that they will suffer irreparable or grave harm from the issuance of a preliminary injunction. (Ibid.)II. Defendant does not show they will suffer grave or irreparable harm from the issuance of the preliminary injunction Bhamani argues he will suffer irreparable harm because a court-ordered demolition of the existing Subject Property structures would cause Defendants to “lose the rights to legal nonconforming use (grandfathering) of those improvements that were approved and permitted in 1980,” new building costs are prohibitive and not feasible, he would be unable to “live in, rent or sell the Subject Properties.” (Bhamani Decl., ¶¶ 8–9.) None of these arguments persuasive. “[A] party suffers no grave or irreparable harm by being prohibited from violating the law.”  (People v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th 266, 306.) The City has successfully argued and provided evidence that Bhamani is in violation of the CMC, and thus the City is seeking to prohibit Bhamani from continuing to violate the law. Additionally, financial or economic harm, as Bhamani is essentially arguing, does not constitute substantial grave or irreparable harm. (See IT Corp., supra, 35 Cal.3d at p. 75 [finding no irreparable or grave harm from substantial economic loss]. Finally, Bhamani does not meet his burden to establish the existence of any legal non-conforming use. (See Melton v. City of San Pablo (1967) 252 Cal.App.2d 794, 804 [The burden of proof is on the party asserting a right to a nonconforming use to establish the lawful and continuing existence of the use at the time of the enactment of the ordinance.”].) The City shows that Bhamani’s claimed nonconforming use does not correspond to the existing conditions on the Subject Properties, and as a result Bhamani would “not lose any legal right if required to comply with the CMC.” (Reply, p. 8:15–25.) Essentially, the claimed legal nonconforming use from the 1980 permits and renovation relates only to rehabilitation work and not to any new construction, and thus, there is no legal nonconforming use flowing from new construction, since there arguably was no new construction. (See Cohen Decl., ¶ 24, Ex. X.) Bhamani also argues that the City’s alleged harm is speculative, but in this instance, the City’s irreparable harm is presumed once the City proved a reasonable probability they will succeed on their nuisance per se claims. (See IT Corp., supra, 35 Cal.3d at p. 72 [“Where a governmental entity seeking to enjoin the alleged violation of an ordinance which specifically provides for injunctive relief establishes that it is reasonably probable it will prevail on the merits, a rebuttable presumption arises that the potential harm to the public outweighs the potential harm to the defendant.”).)Thus, the City’s request for a preliminary injunction is GRANTED. III. The City is not required to Post UndertakingCCP § 529 requires an undertaking to be made by the party seeking a preliminary injunction with a few exceptions including the requirement does not apply to a governmental entity pursuant to CCP § 995.220. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 529 [“On granting an injunction, the court or judge must require an undertaking on the part of the applicant to the effect that the applicant will pay to the party enjoined any damage . . . . (b) This section does not apply to any of the following persons: . . .  (3) A public entity or officer described in Section 995.220.”]; Code Civ. Proc., § 995.220 [“the following public entities and officers are not required to give the bond and shall have the same rights, remedies, and benefits as if the bond were given: . . . . (b) A county, city, or district, or public authority, public agency, or other political subdivision in the state, or an officer of the local public entity in an official capacity or on behalf of the local public entity.”].)The City is a governmental entity as defined by CCP § 995.220 and thus is exempt from posting a bond.
