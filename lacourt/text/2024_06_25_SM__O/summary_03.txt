And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has ruled in favor of the defendant, Larry Cogan, and granted his motion to strike punitive damages from the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Steven Lalich, had alleged that Cogan was intoxicated at the time of the incident and was seeking punitive damages. However, the judge found that Lalich's conclusory allegations were not sufficient to establish malice, which is required for a punitive damages claim under California Civil Code section 3294. The judge noted that the allegations did not rise to the level of conscious disregard for the safety of others or malice, and that Lalich needed to plead more facts to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge relied on precedent set in cases such as Taylor v. Superior Court and Dawes v. Superior Court to support their decision. As a result, the portions of the complaint alleging punitive damages have been struck from the record.
