And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

In the case of Blake v. Langer, et al., the defendant Jeremiah Michael Langer filed a demurrer without motion to strike, which has been tentatively ruled as OVERRULED. The demurrer was insufficiently noticed and attacked the non-operative original complaint, which was served on the defendant a day after the demurrer was filed. Furthermore, the defendant's substantive arguments lack merit. The judge also granted the defendant's request for judicial notice, citing the case Glaski v. Bank of America (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 1079, 1090, which states that courts can take judicial notice of the existence, content, and authenticity of public records, but not the truth of the factual matters asserted in those documents.
