And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to discovery requests as moot, since the defendant has already served supplemental responses. The judge also denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions. The plaintiff had sought to compel further responses to discovery requests and requests for sanctions, claiming that the defendant's responses were deficient. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff's separate statements fail to adequately establish a proper reason for compelling further responses as to each discovery request.
