And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The Court will hear argument on the demurrer and motion to strike. The Court notes that the parties have failed to meet and confer as required by law. The demurrer is sustained as to the first, ninth, and tenth causes of action. The Court also notes that the TAC is written in a confusing manner and that the allegations are difficult to decipher. The Court will hear argument on the motion to strike, which is also sustained. The Court rules that the requests for treble damages in paragraphs 141 and 4 of the Prayer for Relief are irrelevant and should be stricken from the TAC.
