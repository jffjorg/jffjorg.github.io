Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendants, Mark G. Mcnelis and Mark G. Mcnelis & Associates, CPA's, Inc. The defendants demurred to the plaintiff's amended complaint, alleging that the causes of action for breach of contract and accounting fail to state a cause of action.

The judge has overruled the demurrer as to the second cause of action (common counts), finding that the plaintiff's allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action. The judge has sustained the demurrer as to the third cause of action (accounting), finding that the plaintiff has failed to allege a fiduciary relationship or a complicated account that requires an accounting.

The judge has granted leave to amend the complaint as to the third cause of action, allowing the plaintiff to replead the allegations and provide a more detailed statement of the account.
