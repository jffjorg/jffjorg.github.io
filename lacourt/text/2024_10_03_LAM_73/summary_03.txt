And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Plaintiff's motion for attorney fees incurred on appeal in the amount of $18,438.00. The judge denies Plaintiff's request for costs incurred on appeal in the amount of $412.20. The judge finds that Plaintiff is entitled to seek reasonable attorney fees under Government Code section 12965(b) for the costs incurred on appeal of the Court's order. The judge also finds that the hourly rate of $878 asserted by Plaintiff's counsel is reasonable and that the claimed hours are reasonable. The judge notes that Plaintiff has not filed a verified memorandum of costs pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 8.278(c)(1), and therefore denies Plaintiff's request for costs on this ground.
