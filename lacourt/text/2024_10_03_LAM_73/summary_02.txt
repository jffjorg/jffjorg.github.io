And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Court grants Plaintiff's Motion to Lift Stay and For Leave to File Second Amended Complaint. The Court finds that Plaintiff has established good cause to bring the claims now and there has not been unreasonable delay. The Court also finds that Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend complies with the California Rules of Court. The Court denies Defendant's arguments that they will be prejudiced by the proposed amendments and finds that the amendments will not be futile. The Court grants the motion because judicial policy favors the resolution of all disputed matters in the same lawsuit.
