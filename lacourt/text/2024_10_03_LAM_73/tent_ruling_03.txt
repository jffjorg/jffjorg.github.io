TENTATIVE RULING
 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for attorney fees incurred on appeal in the amount $18,438.00. The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s request for costs

I. BACKGROUND
  
On December 27, 2022, Plaintiff Citlali
Lopez Mayte Martinez filed this employment action against Defendants Simplified
Labor Staffing Solutions, Inc. (“Simplified Labor”) and William Espinoza
(“Espinoza”).  
 
The Complaint asserts the following
causes of action: 
1.     
Discrimination in Violation of Cal.
Gov. Code §§ 12940 et seq. (FEHA); 
2.     
Harassment in Violation of the FEHA;
3.     
Retaliation in Violation of the FEHA;
4.     
Failure to Prevent Harassment, Discrimination, and
Retaliation in Violation of Government Code § 12940(K);
5.     
Negligent Supervision and Retention;
6.     
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress;
7.     
Wrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy; and
8.     
Failure to Permit Inspection of Personnel and Payroll
Records.
 
The Complaint
alleges the following. On or about
January 11, 2022, Plaintiff began working for Defendants as a laborer at
Defendants’ warehouse in Lynwood, California. Plaintiff was a full-time,
non-exempt employee, and performed all of Plaintiff’s job duties satisfactorily
before Defendants wrongfully terminated Plaintiff’s employment on or about
April 20, 2022, in retaliation for making protected FEHA complaints about
supervisor Espinoza’s sexual harassment of Plaintiff.
 
On July 11, 2024, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion for attorney
fees stating that Plaintiff had not established that remittitur was issued.
(Court’s 07/11/24 Minute Order.)
 
On
August 7, 2024, Plaintiff
filed a Motion for Attorney Fees, arguing:
·      
Plaintiff moves for an order awarding her attorney
fees and costs in the amount of $18,850.20 from Defendant and their attorneys,
pursuant to the appellate court decision dated May 15, 2024.
·      
Defendants filed an unsuccessful motion to compel arbitration. The
present sexual harassment case was clearly barred by the Ending Forced
Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 (“EFASASH”) and
they filed their motion anyways.
·      
The appellate court denied the appeal and affirmed the trial court
ruling.
·      
The appellate court granted costs on appeal to Plaintiff.
·      
California public policy supports Defendants paying for the delay
they caused by covering Plaintiff’s Attorney Fees and costs. SB 365 was later
passed in January 2024 to stop attorneys like those from Hill Farrer in this
case from strategically bringing frivolous appeals as a delay tactic.
·      
Plaintiff’s counsel’s rates and hours billed are reasonable. 
 
On June 27, 2024, Defendant Simplified Labor filed an opposition,
arguing: 
·      
Here, Plaintiff contends she is entitled to attorney’s fees as the
“prevailing party,” pursuant to Government Code section 12965(b). However, Plaintiff
cannot avail herself of that statute because the case is still pending and
there has been no adjudication of the merits.
·      
Plaintiff has not properly requested reimbursement for costs, and
the time to do so has expired. Plaintiff
has not filed or served a verified memorandum of costs under rule 3.1700 and
more than 40 days has passed since the remittitur was issued on August 6, 2024.
 
Plaintiff did not file a reply.
 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.      Legal
Standard 
 
“As a general rule, the prevailing party may recover
certain statutory costs incurred in the litigation up to and including entry of
judgment. [Citations.] These costs may include attorney fees, if authorized by
contract, statute . . . or law. [Citation.] . . . attorney fees require a
separate noticed motion. [Citations.]” (Lucky United Props. Inv., Inc. v.
Lee (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 125, 137.) This motion may be brought: (1) after
judgment or dismissal, for fees incurred “up to and including the rendition of
judgment in the trial court--including attorney’s fees on an appeal before the
rendition of judgment…”; and (2) on an interim basis, upon remittitur of
appeal, of only fees incurred on appeal. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rules
3.1702(b)-(c).)
 
Under
California Rules of Court, rule 8.278(a)(1), the party prevailing in the Court
of Appeal in a civil case (other than a juvenile case) is entitled to costs on
appeal.  The
prevailing party is the respondent if the Court of Appeal affirms the judgment
without modification or dismisses the appeal. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
8.278(a)(2).) 
 
“Unless the
court orders otherwise, an award of costs neither includes attorney’s fees on
appeal nor precludes a party from seeking them under rule 3.1702.” (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 8.278.) 
 
However,
“[w]here attorney’s fees are authorized by statute they are authorized on
appeal as well as in the trial court.” (People ex rel. Cooper v. Mitchell
Brothers’ Santa Ana Theater (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 378, 387.) 
 
B.      Whether
Plaintiff Can Seek Attorneys’ Fees
 
Plaintiff moves for an order awarding her attorney fees incurred on appeal in the
amount $18,438.00
from Defendants and their attorneys, pursuant to the appellate court decision
dated May 15, 2024.
 
On April 7, 2023, Defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration
pursuant to an arbitration agreement purportedly signed by Plaintiff. On July
13, 2023, this Court denied Defendants’ motion to compel Plaintiff’s sex
harassment case to arbitration, finding that the case was barred by the Ending
Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021
(“EFASASH”). Defendant appealed the trial court’s order. On May 15, 2024, the
appellate court denied the appeal and affirmed the trial court ruling. (Avila
Decl., Ex. A.)
 
Rule 3.1702 allows a motion for attorney fees to be
brought upon remittitur of appeal of the fees incurred on appeal. On August 6,
2024, the clerk of the Court of Appeal entered on the record, and inserted in
the remittitur, a judgment awarding costs to the prevailing party, stating “Respondent
is awarded her costs of appeal.” (Avila
Decl., Ex. C.)
 
In opposition, Defendants argue that Plaintiff is not entitled to
attorneys fees because the case is still pending and there has been no
adjudication of the merits. Defendants cite to cases, including Frog Creek
Partners, LLC v. Vance Brown, Inc. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 515 (Frog
Creek), in support of this argument. In Frog Creek, two parties
entered into a contract with an arbitration clause and a separate attorneys
fees provision. (Id. at 520.) A dispute arose, and defendant petitions
to compel arbitration. (Id.) The Court of Appeal concluded that a plaintiff
that defeats the petition to compel arbitration is not entitled to recover
attorney’s fees because under Civil Code section 1717, “there may only be one
prevailing party entitled to attorney fees on a given contract in a given
lawsuit.” (Id.) The Frog Creek court considered the holding in
Acosta, and rejected the rationale that “specific contract language may
justify a separate attorney fee award.” (Id. at 544.) According to the Frog
Creek court, the rationale in Acosta “threatens to significantly
undermine” the policy behind Civil Code section 1717. (Id. at
544-545.) 
 
However, unlike the plaintiff in Frog Creek, Plaintiff here
is not seeking attorney’s fees under Civil Code section 1717, but under Govt.
Code section 12940. California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act (“FEHA”)
(Govt. Code section 12940 et. seq.) provides for attorney’s fees to the
prevailing party in suits brought for employment discrimination. (See Chavez
v. City of Los Angeles (2010) 47 Cal.4th 970, 976) (“In any action brought
under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) (Gov. Code, § 12900
et seq.). Government Code section 12965, subdivision (b), grants the trial
court discretion to award attorney fees to a prevailing party. This statute has
been interpreted to mean that in a FEHA action a trial court should ordinarily
award attorney fees to a prevailing plaintiff unless special circumstances
would render a fee award unjust. (Young v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2008) 168
Cal.App.4th 1467, 1474; Steele v. Jensen Instrument Co. (1997) 59
Cal.App.4th 326, 331.)”) Therefore, the Court does not find Defendants’
arguments persuasive. Defendants do not provide authority establishing that
Plaintiff is not able to recover attorney fees under the FEHA for the costs
incurred on appeal of the Court’s order. Therefore, the Court finds Plaintiff
is entitled to seek reasonable attorney fees.
 
C.      Reasonableness
of the Attorneys’ Fees
 
In determining what fees are reasonable, California courts apply
the “lodestar” approach. (See, e.g., Holguin v. DISH Network LLC (2014)
229 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1332.) This inquiry “begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e.,
the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate.” (See PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) From there,
the “[t]he lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of
factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value
for the legal services provided.” (Id.) Relevant factors include: “(1) the
novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in
presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded
other employment by the attorneys, [and] (4) the contingent nature of the fee
award.” (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)
 
“The
reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar
work.”  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “The
experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services
rendered in [her] court.” (Ibid.) An attorney’s own billing rates carry a presumption of
reasonableness. (Mandel v. Lackner (1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 747, 761)
 
Plaintiff’s counsel asserts her hourly rate of $878 is a
reasonable rate and within the range of current market rates in Los Angeles for
attorneys of similar experience. (Avila Decl., ¶ 3.) The Court finds that the rate requested by Plaintiff’s
counsel is reasonable. Counsel’s
declaration sufficiently attests to her experience and the reasonableness of
the rates. (Avila
Decl., ¶¶ 3, 11.) Based on the evidence before it, the Court is not
inclined to reduce the hourly rates requested.
 
Plaintiff’s counsel also states she expended 21 hours on the
appeal in this case. (Avila Decl., ¶ 9.) Here, the
Court has reviewed all of the claimed hours and finds the hours reasonable. 
 
Defendants have not opposed the reasonableness of the fees sought
in the motion.
 
Therefore, the total sum of the attorney’s fees is $18,438.00 (21
x $878/hr.).
 
D.     Costs
 
Plaintiff moves for an order awarding her costs incurred on appeal in the amount $412.20 from Defendant and their attorneys. 
 
However, Defendants argue Plaintiff has not properly requested
reimbursement for costs.
 
“Within 40 days after issuance of the remittitur, a party claiming
costs awarded by a reviewing court must serve and file in the superior court a
verified memorandum of costs under rule 3.1700.” (Cal. R. Ct. 8.278(c)(1); see
Jud. Coun. Form MC-012 (“Form Adopted for Mandatory Use”).)
 
Here, while Plaintiff attached a memorandum of costs to her
motion, Plaintiff has not filed a verified memorandum of costs pursuant to Cal.
R. Ct. 8.278(c)(1). Therefore, the Court does not grant Plaintiff’s request for
costs on this ground. 
 
III. DISPOSITION
 

Accordingly,
the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for attorney fees incurred
on appeal in the amount $18,438.00.
The Court DENIES Plaintiff’s request for costs incurred on appeal in the amount
of $412.20.
