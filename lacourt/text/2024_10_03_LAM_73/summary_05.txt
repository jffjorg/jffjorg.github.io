The Honorable Judge Rolf Treu has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mingzhe Zhao v. Mi In Fashion, Inc., dba Ces Femme, et al. (24STCV08148). The Plaintiff, Mingzhe Zhao, moved to strike the unverified answers filed by the Defendants, Mi In Fashion, Inc., Hyun S. Lee, and Young Mi Lee. The Plaintiff argued that the answers contained only general denials and did not provide specific denials to the allegations made in the Complaint.

The Court granted the motion to strike, finding that the answers were unverified and did not comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure. The Court also noted that the Defendants did not file an opposition to the motion. The Plaintiff was granted 20 days to amend its complaint.

The case will proceed with the Plaintiff's amended complaint.
