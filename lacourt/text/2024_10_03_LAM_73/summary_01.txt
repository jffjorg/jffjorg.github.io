Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to vacate the ruling on the defendants' motion for summary judgment/adjudication. The plaintiff argues that the defendants did not include Rochelle Sterling as an individual defendant in the motion, but the court previously addressed this issue and found that Sterling has participated in the case. The plaintiff also fails to identify statutory authority for her motion to vacate, and instead cites to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(d)(3), which provides for relief from an order based on fraud. The plaintiff's arguments are therefore without merit, and the motion is denied.
