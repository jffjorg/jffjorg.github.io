PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (filed on 07/12/2024)
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
Plaintiff’s
Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.
 
I. BACKGROUND
 
On August 23, 2023, Plaintiff Atlas Capital, Inc. brought this breach
of contract action against Defendant Temple Poteat.
 
The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff and Defendant entered into two
loan agreements, which Defendant subsequently defaulted on. (Compl., p. 4.) Defendant
had filed for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy, which was ultimately dismissed on August
16, 2023. (Ibid.) Plaintiff is seeking balance due on both loan
agreements, interest, late fees and attorney fees. (Compl., p. 3.)
 
Defendant filed an answer on September 29, 2023. 
 
On July 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed the
instant Motion for Summary Judgment, arguing:
·      
The facts are undisputed, Defendant signed two promissory notes
for Loan Numbers 100948 and 100964. In late 2022 Defendant ultimately breached
both promissory notes by failing to make the required scheduled payments
pursuant to the note.
·      
Defendant only merely disputes Plaintiff’s request for damages but
has refused to respond to discovery, failing to provide evidentiary support to
refute Plaintiff’s claimed damages.
 
Defendant did not file an opposition.
 
II. ANALYSIS
 
A.     Legal
Standard 
 
 “A party may move for summary adjudication of issues, either
by itself or as an alternative to summary judgment. If it appears that the
proof supports the granting of the motion for summary adjudication as to some
but not all the issues involved in the action, or that one or more of the
issues raised by a claim is admitted, or that one or more of the issues raised
by a defense is conceded, the court shall, by order, specify that those issues
are without substantial controversy. Moreover, upon a motion for summary
adjudication, the court shall, by written order or oral order recorded
verbatim, specify those issues raised by the motion for summary adjudication as
to which there exists a material, triable controversy, and shall specifically
refer to the evidence which establishes a triable issue of fact regarding each
of those issues ....”  (Cal.
Code. Civ. Proc. § 437c(f)).   
 
A plaintiff moving for summary
judgment/summary adjudication bears the initial burden of showing that “there
is no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) “Plaintiff's¿initial¿burden¿of proof in
moving for summary judgment, however, d[oes] not include disproving any
affirmative defenses asserted by defendants.”  (Oldcastle Precast, Inc. v.
Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co.¿(2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 554, 564, citing Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 853 (“Aguilar”) [“summary judgment
law in this state no longer requires a¿plaintiff¿moving for summary judgment to
disprove any defense asserted by the defendant as well as prove each element of
his own cause of action.... All that the¿plaintiff¿need do is to ‘prove[ ] each element of the cause of action’ ”])  Once Plaintiff meets its
initial burden of proving each element of the cause of action, “the burden shifts
to the defendant “to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts
exists as to that cause of action¿or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.) 
 
As noted in Aguilar, “the party
moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a
prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact;
if he carries his burden of production, he causes a shift, and the opposing
party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima
facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.”  (Aguilar,
supra, 25 Cal.4th at 850.)  Thus, courts usually follow a three-step
analysis: “First, we identify the issues framed by the pleadings .
. . . [¶]
Secondly, we determine whether the moving party’s showing has established facts
which negate the opponent’s claim and justify a judgment in movant’s favor.
. . . [¶] When a
. . . motion prima facie justifies a judgment, the third and final step is to
determine whether the opposition demonstrates the existence of a triable,
material factual issue.”  (Ojavan Investors, Inc. v. Cal. Coastal Comm.
(1997) 54
Cal.App.4th 373, 385 [citation and footnote omitted].) 
 
The California Supreme Court has
recently confirmed that the purpose of the 1992 and 1993 amendments to the
summary judgment statute was “‘to liberalize the granting of [summary judgment]
motions.’” (Perry v. Bakewell Hawthorne, LLC (2017) 2 Cal.5th 536,
542.)  It is no longer called a “disfavored” remedy.  “Summary
judgment is now seen as a ‘particularly suitable means to test the sufficiency’
of the plaintiff’s or defendant’s case.”  (Ibid.) 
 
Opposing parties must present
substantial evidence in order to avoid summary judgment.  (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
163.)  “In some instances…, ‘evidence may be so lacking in
probative value that it fails to raise any triable issue.’”  (Whitmire
v. Ingersoll-Rand Co. (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1078, 1083-1084.)  “A
complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving
party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial.”  (Hunter
v. Pacific Mechanical Corp (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1282, 1286, disapproved on
other grounds by Aguilar, supra, at 865; accord Saelzler v. Advanced Group 400 (2001) 25 Cal.4th 763, 780 [“‘If the
plaintiff is unable to meet her burden of proof regarding an essential element
of her case, all other facts are rendered immaterial.’”].) 
 
Courts “construe the moving party's affidavits strictly,
construe the opponent's affidavits liberally, and resolve doubts about the¿propriety¿of granting the motion in favor of the party opposing
it.’” (Unilab Corp.v.
Angeles-IPA (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 622, 636; internal citation omitted.)  “The court focuses
on issue finding; it does not resolve issues of fact. The court seeks to find
contradictions in the evidence, or inferences reasonably deducible from the
evidence, which raise a triable issue of material fact.”  (Johnson v.
United Cerebral Palsy, etc. (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 740, 754; internal
citation omitted.)    "[S]ummary judgment cannot be
granted when the facts are susceptible [of] more than one reasonable
inference...” (Rosas v. BASF Corp.¿(2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1392.) 
 
B.     Discussion
 
Plaintiff
moves for summary judgment of the Complaint’s only cause of action for breach
of contract.
 
To state a cause of action for breach of
contract, Plaintiff must be able to establish “(1) the existence of the
contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.”  (Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011)
51 Cal.4th 811, 821.)
 
The Complaint alleges the following. Plaintiff made
two loans to Defendant. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a loan agreement
identified as Loan No 100948 on 9/28/2021. The loan was secured by a commercial
tractor identified as a 2015 Freightliner (VIN ending GW3505). The principal
loan amount was $25,000.00. Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a second loan
agreement identified as Loan No 100964 on 1/4/2022. The loan was secured by a
commercial tractor identified as a 2016 Freightliner (VIN ending GH0616). The
principal loan amount was $25,023.00. Defendant defaulted on the loan, causing
Plaintiff to repossess the collateral subject to Loan No 100948. Defendant
subsequently filed Chapter 13 Bankruptcy, ceasing Plaintiff's collection
efforts. During Bankruptcy negotiations between counsel for Plaintiff 'and
Defendant, Defendant surrendered possession to the collateral subject to Loan
No 100964. Both vehicles were ultimately sold and sale proceeds applied to
their respective accounts. The remaining balances on each loan are as follows: (1)
Loan No 100948: $8,628.55 as of 8/22/2023 (2) Loan No 100964: $30,055.55 as of
8/22/2023. 
 
Plaintiff argues that there exist no disputed
issues of material fact regarding any elements of Defendant’s breach. In
support, Plaintiff submits copies of the first and second loan agreements
signed by Plaintiff and Defendant. (Shoumer Decl., Exs. 1, 3.) The agreements
provide in relevant part that “If you fail to pay us what you owe when it is
due or when we demand you pay, you will be in default of this Agreement.” (Id.,
Ex. 1, p. 2; Ex. 3, p. 2.) Plaintiff also submits copies of the Payment
Statements for the first and second loans, which show that Defendant failed to
make the monthly required payments. (Id., Ex. 2; Ex. 4.) In addition,
Plaintiff submits copies of the Sale Credit Statements showing credit that was
applied to the outstanding balance on both loans as a result of the sale of the
vehicles that were collateral to the loans. (Id., Ex. 5; Ex. 6.)
 
The Court
finds that Plaintiff has met its burden. Plaintiff provided a copy of the loan
agreements showing the existence of a contract between the parties and
Plaintiff provided evidence attesting to Plaintiff’s performance of the
agreements and Defendant’s default under the agreements by failing to make
required loan payments. The burden shifts to Defendant. Yet, Defendant did not
file an opposition and did not provide evidence of a disputed material issue of
fact. “A party who
has not timely filed written opposition to a motion…may not be afforded an opportunity
to offer oral argument at the hearing.” (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.) “The failure to file opposition creates an
inference that the motion…is meritorious.”¿(Ibid.) Thus, Defendant fails
to carry her burden.
 
Therefore,
the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment. 
 
III. DISPOSITION

 
Plaintiff’s
Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.
