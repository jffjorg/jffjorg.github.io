And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the plaintiff's recent declaration, which states that a particular contract is authentic and may be subject to arbitration. The court will not order arbitration based on a status conference memo, but the plaintiff is free to move to compel arbitration and the defendant will respond in due course. The court is inclined to allow a mediation to go forward, as previously agreed upon by the defendant and her friend's attorney. The plaintiff's counsel has also raised concerns about discovery issues, which the court will not comment on. The court notes that the more discovery the plaintiff insists on taking, the stronger an arbitration waiver argument becomes. The court is concerned about the mandatory time to bring the action to trial and will discuss all of these issues at the upcoming hearing.
