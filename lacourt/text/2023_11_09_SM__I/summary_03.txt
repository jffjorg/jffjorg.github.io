And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is to grant the unopposed motion to continue the trial, currently set for January 29, 2024. The Defendant contends that the parties have not completed their discovery and that there are unknown subcontractors who may need to be added. The Judge is not pleased with the situation, stating that the complaint was filed over two years ago and that it is surprising that the parties are not aware of the subcontractors. The Judge believes that the Defendant has not shown diligence in discovery and that an inspection is premature until all parties are present. The Judge grants the continuance, but warns that there will be no further continuances without extraordinary cause. The Judge also notes that any new parties added to the case will require leave of court and that the parties should discuss the plan to bring the case to resolution. A status conference will be held in 30 days to review the parties' progress.
