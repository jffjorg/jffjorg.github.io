And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a plaintiff's ex parte application to advance the hearing on a defendant's motion to quash service. The motion was filed on November 2, 2023, and the hearing was originally set for January 2, 2024. The plaintiff argues that a UD case should move quickly and that a two-month delay in hearing this motion is not consistent with that. The judge agrees and is inclined to set the hearing for November 16, 2023 at 9:00 am. The ex parte application is therefore granted. The defendant may file a reply to the plaintiff's opposition by November 13, 2023.
