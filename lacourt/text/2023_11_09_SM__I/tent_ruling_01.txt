  Case Number:  18SMCV00349    Hearing Date:   November 9, 2023    Dept:  I The court is in receipt of plaintiff’s counsel’s recent
declaration.  In it, plaintiff’s counsel
states that it now believes, based on further investigation, that a particular
contract is in fact authentic.  That
contract has an arbitration provision in it and it appears that plaintiff is
going to seek arbitration.  The court
will not order arbitration based on a statement in a status conference memo,
but plaintiff is free to move to compel arbitration and defendant will respond
in due course.  If plaintiff is going to
do so, plaintiff should do it quickly.
Plaintiff’s counsel also stated that the parties need to
mediate, as defendant and her friend (but not counsel of record) attorney
Millman had previously agreed to do.  The
court is inclined to allow the mediation to go forward and to order it based on
defendant’s prior representations.
Plaintiff’s counsel has also expressed concern over
discovery issues.  The court will not
comment on them as they are not before the court.
Finally, plaintiff’s counsel alludes to certain difficulties
communicating with plaintiff and other issues that are recent, and explained
that the absence at the last hearing was due to technical problems—which the
court can well understand.
In light of all of that, the court is inclined to set a
trial date without prejudice to any motions that either party might want to
bring.  The court notes, though, that the
more discovery plaintiff insists on taking or bringing motions to compel about,
the stronger an arbitration waiver argument becomes.  The court is also concerned about the
mandatory time to bring an action to trial. 
The court is aware that for a considerable time the delay could be
attributable to the defense rather than the plaintiff.  But the fact remains that the time is
running.
The court will discuss all of this at the hearing.
