 Case Number:  SC124878    Hearing Date:   November 9, 2023    Dept:  I The problem is that defendant seems to refuse to comply with
the court’s orders.  That leaves the
court with two options: one is to issue an OSC re: Contempt and, if he is found
guilty, to sentence him accordingly. 
While that might have the desired effect of compelling behavior, it is
also possible that it will simply have the effect of sentencing the Illulians
to a short, one or two day stay in the County Jail, which does not really help
plaintiff.  The other is to set a hearing
to determine the diminution of value of plaintiff’s property by virtue of
Illulian’s refusal to obey court orders. 
The court notes that plaintiff need not hire an expert to so opine
(although he could).  As the property’s
owner, plaintiff is able to estimate the value of his property.  Illulian, however, would need expert
testimony to rebut plaintiff’s view.  The
court could then award plaintiff as damages whatever diminution of value the
court determines exists due to Illulian’s refusal to comply.  That becomes a money judgment and plaintiff
could then collect on it through garnishment, levy, lien, or any other
appropriate means.  The court considered
simply issuing an order allowing the fence to be built, but the City requires a
permit, and the court does not believe it can order the City—which is not a
party—to issue a permit that the property’s owner does not seek.
The court will discuss this with the parties, but the time
has come for Illulian to obey the court’s order or for the court to find some
other way to enforce the order.
