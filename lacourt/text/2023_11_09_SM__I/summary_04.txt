Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike in a Song-Beverly case involving allegations of fraud. The plaintiff leased a new Chevy Bolt in May 2021, but alleges that the vehicle had serious defects and did not meet the specifications she was promised. The defendant has raised similar concerns in an earlier demurrer, but the judge has overruled the demurrer as to the negligent misrepresentation cause of action.

The judge has also denied the motion to strike, finding that the allegations are sufficient for pleading purposes. The judge has also held that punitive damages are available under the Song-Beverly Act, even though they are not specified under the act. The judge has relied on a recent case, Anderson v. Ford Motor Co., which suggests that both compensatory and punitive damages can be awarded to a plaintiff so long as there is no double recovery.

The judge has given the defendant 30 days to answer the complaint, and has set the matter for a hearing on November 9, 2023. The judge has also indicated that a motion for summary adjudication may be appropriate on the issue of whether the plaintiff relied on any statements made directly by General Motors, as opposed to relying on statements made by the dealer.
