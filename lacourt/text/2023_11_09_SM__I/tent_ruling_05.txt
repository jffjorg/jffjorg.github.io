 Case Number:  23SMCV04516    Hearing Date:   November 9, 2023    Dept:  I Plaintiff applies ex parte for an order advancing the  hearing on defendant’s motion to quash service, which is currently calendared  for January 2, 2024.  The motion was  filed on November 2, 2023, which is a bit surprising to the court given that  the court had thought it was running about 5-6 weeks to reserve a date rather  than 8-9.  In any event, plaintiff argues  that a UD case should move quickly and that a two month delay in hearing this  motion is not consistent with that.  And  plaintiff is right.  A motion to quash is  supposed to be brought within 5 days of service of the complaint.  Here, defendant states it learned of the case  on October 26, 2023 and the MTQ was filed on 11/2/23.  That is a day late, but the court is unlikely  to hold that against defendant.  And, of  course, if the court lacks jurisdiction over defendant, then it does.  However, the hearing is supposed to be held  within 7 days.  Here, as set forth above,  the hearing was set months out.  Perhaps  that was the calendaring system (as of yesterday, though, it appeared to be  closer to four weeks between the time a reservation was sought and the hearing  date).  For these purposes, the court  will assume that defendant chose the earliest date available.  But even so, it is still not consistent with  the Code. The court is inclined to set  the hearing for November 16, 2023 at 9:00 am.   And will do so.  The ex parte  application is therefore GRANTED.   Plaintiff has already filed its opposition.  If defendant wants to file a reply, he may do  so no later than November 13.  The court has very little availability, so that date is pretty firm.
