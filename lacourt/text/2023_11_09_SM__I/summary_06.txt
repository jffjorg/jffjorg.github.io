And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering the defendant's refusal to comply with court orders and is faced with two options. The first is to issue a contempt order and sentence the defendant if found guilty, which could have the effect of compelling compliance. However, this may only result in a short jail sentence, which may not be effective in resolving the issue. The second option is to hold a hearing to determine the diminution of value of the plaintiff's property as a result of the defendant's non-compliance. The plaintiff can estimate the value of their property, and the defendant would need expert testimony to rebut this. The court could then award damages to the plaintiff, which could be collected through various means. The judge notes that the City requires a permit to build the fence, and the court cannot order the City to issue a permit. The judge will discuss this with the parties and is considering alternative ways to enforce the court's orders.
