Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted a preliminary injunction against Capital One, N.A. and denied a preliminary injunction against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The plaintiff, Palm West Escrow, Inc., seeks to freeze funds and prevent defendants from using, transferring, concealing or otherwise making unavailable any portion of the stolen funds. The judge found that the elements for a preliminary injunction have not been met as to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. because the plaintiff has not met its burden that it is likely that it will prevail as to Chase, the purported holder of a closed account, and that it will suffer harm in the interim because Chase is purportedly not holding any funds.
