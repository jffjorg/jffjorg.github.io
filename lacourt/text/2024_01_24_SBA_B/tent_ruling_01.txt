LLC as Doe 4, Ighor Etienne as Doe 5, District Logistics LLC as Doe 6, Robert
Terrell as Doe 7, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Doe 8, Bank of America, NA as
Doe 9.
            On December 21, 2023, the court
granted a TRO and OSC re preliminary injunction.
            On January 18, 2024, plaintiff filed
an undertaking.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
“Trial courts traditionally
consider and weigh two factors in determining whether to issue a preliminary
injunction.  They are (1) how likely it
is that the moving party will prevail on the merits, and (2) the relative harm
the parties will suffer in the interim due to the issuance or non-issuance of
the injunction.”  Dodge, Warren &
Peters Ins. Services, Inc. v. Riley (2003) 105 Cal. App. 4th 1414,
1420.  “[T]he greater the . . . showing
on one, the less must be shown on the other to support an injunction.”  Id. (citation omitted).  The burden of proof is on the plaintiff as
the moving party “to show all elements necessary to support issuance of a
preliminary injunction.”  O'Connell v.
Superior Court (2006) 141 Cal. App. 4th 1452, 1481. 
Preliminary injunctive relief
requires the use of competent evidence to create a sufficient factual showing
on the grounds for relief.  See, e.g.,
Ancora-Citronelle Corp. v. Green (1974) 41 Cal. App. 3d 146, 150.  Injunctive relief may be granted based upon a
verified complaint only if it contains sufficient evidentiary as opposed to
ultimate facts.  CCP § 527(a).  A plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must
also show the absence of an adequate damages remedy at law.  CCP §526(a)(4). 
DISCUSSION
            On
December 22, 2023, the court granted plaintiff’s request for a preliminary
injunction freezing funds.  On January
22, 2024, at an ex parte hearing for TRO and OSC re preliminary injunction, the
court set a hearing date for an OSC re preliminary injunction.  Plaintiff requests that a preliminary
injunction be granted as to JPMorgan Chase Bank (Doe 8) and Bank of America, NA
(Doe 9).
JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. (Doe 8) opposes a preliminary injunction against it.
            The
complaint alleges that in October 2023, plaintiff acted as escrow holder for
the sale of the property at 1004 Palos Verdes Drive West, Palos Verdes Estates
for $915,000.  On October 23, 2023, at
the close of escrow, based on purported owner/seller’s instructions, submitted
to escrow by Does 1-10, plaintiff caused $270,811.31 (“stolen funds”) of the
owner/seller’s proceeds to be paid by wire transfer to Capital One Account No.
5809259947, which plaintiff believed at the time was for the benefit of Walid
Tohme, the true owner of the property. 
Capital One is named solely as a necessary party because Capital One
currently holds some or all of the stolen funds in the subject account.  Complaint, ¶9.  Doe defendants Nos. 1-10 purported to be
Walid Tohme, the true owner of the real property and acted as imposters of
Tohme.  Id., ¶3.  Unknown to plaintiff at the time, the
owner/seller’s instructions to wire the above-referenced owner/seller’s proceeds
to the subject account were fraudulent, having not been made by the
owner/seller but rather by Doe defendants Nos. 1-10 misrepresenting themselves
as the owner/seller of the subject property. 
Id., ¶10.  Upon discovering the
fraud, plaintiff caused a Financial Code 1450 declaration to be served on
November 17, 2023 on Capital One in order to freeze the stolen funds.  Id., ¶12. 

            The
December 22, 2023 order granted plaintiff’s request for a preliminary
injunction freezing funds.  It states
that defendants Capital One, N.A., Micasso Logistics, LLC (Doe 2), Virgil Cloe
Boateng (Doe 3), Ighor Etienne & Sales (Doe 4), District Logistics (Doe 6),
and Robert Terrell (Doe 7) are restrained from using, transferring, concealing
or otherwise making unavailable any portion of the $270,811.31 that was wired
by plaintiff to Acct. No. ending 9947 at Capital One Bank, N.A. on October 23,
2023 and subsequently transferred to Bank of America and Chase.  As it relates to Chase, it states “$41,621.47
to an account at Chase in the name of District Logistics LLC and/or Robert
Terrell, including but not limited to, account number 923500039434.”
            In
its opposition, Chase argues that a preliminary injunction should not be issued
against it because plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that it will prevail on
the merits of its claims against Chase and the issuance of a preliminary
injunction will place a much greater hardship on Chase than plaintiff.  Chase presents evidence that it determined
that there was no account ending 9434 at Chase. 
It determined, however, that a $41,621.47 deposit was made on October
26, 2023 into District Logistics Account ending 9718, and that the account was
closed on December 8, 2023, before Chase had notice of the TRO.  See Kevin J. Thomas decl.  The Doe amendment was not filed until
December 18, 2023, and Chase was not served with the ex parte application for a
TRO until December 19.  Chase asserts
that it is not in possession of the subject funds.  Thus, Chase argues, plaintiff will suffer no
interim harm if the preliminary injunction is denied because there is nothing
to enjoin.  Chase also argues that each
of the claims fails against it because Chase is lumped with the Doe defendants
who are alleged to have acted fraudulently.
            Plaintiff
did not file a reply to Chase’s opposition.
            The
court finds that the elements for a preliminary injunction have not been met as
to Chase.  Plaintiff has not met its
burden that it is likely that it will prevail as to Chase, the purported holder
of a closed account, and that it will suffer harm in the interim because Chase
is purportedly not holding any funds. 
Also, the evidence shows that there is no account held by Chase that can
be effectively frozen.
            A
preliminary injunction against Chase is DENIED.
            Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of ruling.
