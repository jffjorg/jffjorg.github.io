And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that Defendant Jesus Buntan's motion to compel arbitration and dismiss or stay the action is denied. Buntan has waived his right to compel arbitration because he has used the past two years to conduct extensive discovery, post jury fees, and prepare for trial without notifying the Plaintiff that he intended to demand arbitration. The judge finds that Buntan's actions were inconsistent with the right to arbitrate and that the Plaintiff will suffer prejudice if forced to switch gears and prepare for an arbitration after preparing for a trial. The judge relies on California Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2 and relevant case law to support its decision.
