The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Shell's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication in a negligence and premises liability case against Chavis Harris. The case involves an incident that occurred on September 15, 2020, at a gas station in Long Beach, California. Shell argues that it did not own, operate, or control the property and therefore owes no duty to Harris. However, the judge finds that Shell has not carried its initial summary judgment burden on the issue of control and therefore denies the motion for summary judgment. The judge also denies Shell's request to summarily adjudicate Harris's negligence and premises liability claims. The case is set for trial on August 19, 2024.
