completion of arbitration. 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to deny the motion. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“A
written agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a
controversy thereafter arising is valid, enforceable, and irrevocable, save
upon such grounds as exist for the rescission of any contract.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.) 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2 provides in
part: 
“On petition of a party to an arbitration agreement
alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and
that a party to the agreement refuses to arbitrate that controversy, the court
shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if
it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists, unless it
determines that: 
“(a) The right to compel arbitration has been waived
by the petitioner; or 
“(b) Grounds exist for rescission of the
agreement." 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.2,
subds. (a), (b).) 
“Arbitration
is a favored procedure. An ‘ “ ‘arbitration should be upheld unless it can be
said with assurance that an arbitration clause is not susceptible to an
interpretation covering the asserted dispute.’ ” ’ ” (Salgado v. Carrows
Restaurants, Inc. (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 356, 360, quoting Cruise v.
Kroger Co. (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 390, 397.) “Doubts about the
applicability of the arbitration clause to the dispute should be resolved ‘in
favor of sending the parties to arbitration.’ ” (Ibid., quoting Cione
v. Foresters Equity Services, Inc. (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 625, 642.) 
“[N]o
single test delineates the nature of the conduct that will constitute a waiver
of arbitration.”   (St. Agnes Medical
Center v. PacifiCare of California (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1187, 1195 (St.
Agnes).) “ ‘ “In the past, California courts have found a waiver of the
right to demand arbitration in a variety of contexts, ranging from situations
in which the party seeking to compel arbitration has previously taken steps
inconsistent with an intent to invoke arbitration [citations] to instances in
which the petitioning party has unreasonably delayed in undertaking the
procedure. [Citations.] The decisions likewise hold that the “bad faith” or
“wilful misconduct” of a party may constitute a waiver and thus justify a
refusal to compel arbitration. [Citations.]” ’ ” (Id. at p. 1196,
quoting Engalla v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 951,
983.) 
In St.
Agnes, the Supreme Court agreed that the following factors are relevant and
properly considered in assessing waiver claims: “(1) whether the party's
actions are inconsistent with the right to arbitrate; (2) whether ‘the
litigation machinery has been substantially invoked’ and the parties ‘were well
into preparation of a lawsuit’ before the party notified the opposing party of
an intent to arbitrate; (3) whether a party either requested arbitration
enforcement close to the trial date or delayed for a long period before seeking
a stay; (4) whether a defendant seeking arbitration filed a counterclaim
without asking for a stay of the proceedings; (5) ‘whether important
intervening steps [e.g., taking advantage of judicial discovery procedures not
available in arbitration] had taken place’; and (6) whether the delay
‘affected, misled, or prejudiced’ the opposing party.” ’ ” (St. Agnes, supra,
31 Cal.4th at p. 1196, quoting Sobremonte v. Superior Court
(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 980, 992.) 
DISCUSSION         
On
February 25, 2021, the Court granted Uber’s motion to compel arbitration of
Plaintiff’s claims against Uber.  Although
Buntan is not a party to the arbitration agreement between Plaintiff and Uber, Buntan
now moves – three years later – to compel arbitration. 
Even
assuming that Buntan would otherwise be entitled to enforce the arbitration
agreement between Plaintiff and Uber, Buntan has waived that right.  As explained in Plaintiff’s opposition,
Buntan has used the past two years to conduct extensive discovery, post jury
fees, and prepare for trial, without notifying Plaintiff that he intended to
demand arbitration.  Buntan substantially invoked the “litigation
machinery” and his actions were inconsistent with the right to arbitrate.  Plaintiff will suffer prejudice if, after
preparing to go to trial on May 1, 2024, Plaintiff must switch gears and
prepare for an arbitration. 
          Buntan argues that only the arbitrator has authority to
make a finding of waiver.  Code of Civil Procedure section 1281.2, subdivision (a),
provides the Court’s authority. 
          The Court denies Buntan’s motion to compel arbitration. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court
DENIES Defendant Jesus Buntan’s motion to compel arbitration and to dismiss or
stay the action pending the completion of arbitration. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
