And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's allegations of punitive damages. The defendant argued that the complaint did not provide sufficient facts to support a claim for punitive damages. However, the Judge found that the complaint did provide sufficient facts to support such a claim, including the plaintiff's allegations of retaliation and the close temporal proximity between her taking off work and her termination. The Judge also noted that the defendant's arguments that the complaint was too conclusory were unavailing.
