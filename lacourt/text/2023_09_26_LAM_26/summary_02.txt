And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from the defendant, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, LLC. The motion was filed in response to the defendant's failure to provide further responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests. The judge has determined that the motion is moot, as the defendant has already provided supplemental responses to the requests. The judge has also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that the circumstances do not warrant the imposition of sanctions on either party. The judge has acknowledged that the parties have engaged in meet and confer discussions, but the plaintiff still filed the motion, which has resulted in a substantial delay in the discovery process.
