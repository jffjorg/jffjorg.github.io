The judge has acknowledged that the parties have engaged in meet and confer discussions, but the plaintiff still filed the motion, which has resulted in a substantial delay in the discovery process.

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Kristina Holman vs. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, LLC. The case involves a wrongful termination action, and the plaintiff is seeking to compel the defendant to provide further responses to certain discovery requests. The defendant has objected to the discovery requests, and the parties have engaged in meet and confer efforts to resolve the issues.

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses as moot, because the defendant has already provided a further response. The judge has also denied the parties' requests for sanctions, finding that the circumstances do not warrant the imposition of sanctions on either party.

The judge has concluded that the defendant's initial objections to the discovery requests were warranted, given the overbreadth of the requests.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is a denial of the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses, and a denial of the parties' requests for sanctions.
