Summary:

The judge has granted Defendant Quinn Company's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages and surrounding allegations in the complaint. The judge finds that the allegations are insufficient to support a prayer for punitive damages, as they do not provide specific facts or circumstances that would support a claim of oppression, fraud, or malice. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has not alleged any facts that would support a claim of conscious disregard of the safety of others. The judge orders the plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 15 days of notice of this order.
