[TENTATIVE] order RE:
Plaintiff’s motion to COMPEL DEFENDANT CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER
  TO PROVIDE FURTHER RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF’s REQUESTS FOR production, set

Procedural
Background
On March 23,
2022, Plaintiff Kristina Holman (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant wrongful
termination action against Defendants Kerlan-Jobe Surgery Center, LLC,
Kerlan-Jobe, LLC, Cedars-Sinai Kerlan Jobe Institute, and Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center.  On April 28, 2022, Plaintiff
filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants
Kerlan-Jobe Surgery Center, LLC, Kerlan-Jobe, LLC, Cedars-Sinai Kerlan Jobe
Institute,[1]
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Cedar Sinai Medical Care Foundation, and Kerlan-Jobe
Orthopaedic Clinic, a Medical Group Inc. 
The FAC asserts eleven causes of action for (1) Retaliation in violation
of Labor Code § 1102.5, (2) Retaliation in violation of Labor Code § 232.5, (3)
Retaliation in violation of Health & Safety Code § 1278.5, (4)
Discrimination on the Basis of Age in violation of the Fair Employment and
Housing Act (“FEHA”), (5) Discrimination on the Basis of Disability in
violation of FEHA, (6) Failure to Prevent Discrimination in violation of FEHA,
(7) Retaliation in violation of FEHA, (8) Failure to Prevent Retaliation in
violation of FEHA, (9) Failure to Accommodate in violation of FEHA, (10)
Failure to Engage in a Good Faith Interactive Process in violation of FEHA, and
(11) Wrongful Termination in violation of Public Policy.
On July 14, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the instant motion to compel Defendant Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center’s (“CSMC’s”) further responses to Request for Production,
Set Three (“RPDs”).  On September 6,
2023, Defendant CSMC filed an opposition. 
No reply has been filed.
 
Evidentiary
Objections
            Defendant
CSMC has submitted evidentiary objections to the declaration submitted in
support of the instant motion.  However,
these objections are unnecessary because the Court, when reviewing the evidence
is presumed to ignore material it knows is incompetent, irrelevant, or
inadmissible.  (In re Marriage of Davenport (2011) 194 Cal. App.
4th 1507, 1526.)  Courts are presumed to know and apply the correct
statutory and case law and to be able to distinguish admissible from
inadmissible evidence, relevant from irrelevant facts, and to recognize those
facts which properly may be considered in the judicial decision-making
process.  (People v. Coddington (2000) 23 Cal.4th 529, 644.)  Moreover, there is no statutory basis for
evidentiary objections in connection with the instant motion.
 
Legal
Standard 
Requests
for Production of Documents
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310
provides, in pertinent part, as follows:
(a) On receipt
of a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the
demanding party may move for an order compelling further response to the demand
if the demanding party deems that any of the following apply:
(1) A
statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete.
(2) A
representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive.
(3) An
objection in the response is without merit or too general.
(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall
comply with both of the following:
(1) The
motion shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the
discovery sought by the demand.
(2) The
motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040.
 
Code Complaint Response
A code-compliant response to a
request for production consists of any of the following: (1) a statement that
the party will comply, (2) a representation that the party lacks the ability to
comply, or (3) an objection.  (CCP §§
2031.210.)  A
statement that the party will comply must state that the Request for Production
(“RPD”) “will be allowed either in whole or in part, and that all documents or
things in the demanded category that are in the possession, custody, or control
of that party and to which no objection is being made will be included in the
production.”  (CCP § 2031.220.)  “If only part of an item or category of
item in a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
objectionable, the response shall contain a statement of compliance, or a
representation of inability to comply with respect to the remainder of that
item or category.”  (CCP §
2031.240(a).)  If an objection is made
the responding party must “[i]dentify with particularity any document, tangible
thing, land, or electronically stored information falling within any category
of item in the demand to which an objection is being made.”  (CCP § 2031.240(b)(1).)
 
Meet and Confer
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310(b)(2) a motion to compel further
responses to a request for production “shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” 
(CCP § 2031.310(b)(2).) “A meet and confer declaration in support of a
motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.”  (CCP § 2016.040.)  “The level of effort at informal resolution
which satisfies the ‘reasonable and good faith attempt’ standard depends upon
the circumstances. In a larger, more complex discovery context, a greater
effort at informal resolution may be warranted. In a simpler, or more narrowly
focused case, a more modest effort may suffice. The history of the litigation,
the nature of the interaction between counsel, the nature of the issues, the
type and scope of discovery requested, the prospects for success and other
similar factors can be relevant.”  (Obregon
v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 424, 431.)
On June 20,
2023, Defendant CSMC electronically responded to the RPDs at issue. (Gevorkian
Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. 2.)  The response
consisted only of objections.  (Gevorkian
Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. 2.)  On June 20, 2023, Plaintiff
requested to meet and confer regarding these discovery responses.  (Gevorkian Decl. ¶ 10, Exh. 9.)  Later that day, the parties telephonically
met and conferred regarding all discovery in the instant action and a possible
discovery referee.  (Bertikian Decl. ¶¶
4-5, Exh. B.)  On June 29, 2023, and July
5, 2023, Defense Counsel requested a telephonic meet and confer with
Plaintiff’s Counsel regarding all outstanding discovery issues to avoid
unnecessary motion practice.  (Bertikian
Decl. ¶¶ 6-7, Exhs. C-D.)  
On July
10, 2023, Defense Counsel “emailed Plaintiff’s counsel and requested a call to
discuss any outstanding discovery to avoid motion practice as it was unclear
what was outstanding given the amount of discovery Plaintiff’s counsel had
propounded to date. Plaintiff’s counsel then stated that she wanted defense
counsel to identify the discovery—which would defeat the purpose of the call to
discuss what was outstanding—and to identify how long defense counsel wanted to
meet and confer so she may find appropriate time on her calendar.”  (Bertikian Decl. ¶ 8, Exh. E.)  On July 13, 2023, Plaintiff’s Counsel sent an
email demanding an immediate response by the next day and requesting further
complete responses by July 21, 2023. 
(Gevorkian Decl. ¶ 11, Exh. 10.) 
On July 18, 2023, Plaintiff’s Counsel emailed Defense Counsel falsely claiming
that Defense Counsel had never responded to meet and confer attempts which
Defense Counsel noted in its response. 
(Gevorkian Decl. ¶ 12, Exh. 11; Bertikian Decl. ¶ 9, Exh. F.)
The parties
then telephonically met and conferred on August 9, 2023, and Plaintiff agreed
to limit some of the RPDs at issue. 
(Gevorkian Decl. ¶¶ 13-14, Exhs. 13-15; Bertikian Decl. ¶ 12, Exhs. H-I.)  On August 22, 2023, Defense Counsel agreed to
extend the deadline to compel further responses to September 20, 2023.  (Bertikian Decl. ¶ 14, Exh. J.)  
            On August 30, 2023,
Plaintiff filed the instant motion.  The
next day, Defendant served supplemental responses to the RPDs at issue.  (Bertikian Decl. ¶ 15, Exh. O.)  On September 8, 2023, Defense Counsel “asked
Plaintiff’s counsel if she would be withdrawing the instant motion as
supplemental responses were provided. However, Plaintiff’s counsel refused to
withdraw her motion.”  (Bertikian Decl. ¶
16, Exh. K.)
 
Discussion 
Plaintiff
seeks a further response to RPDs Nos. 94, 97, 98, 99, 100, 102, 103, 106, 107,
108, 109, 110, 111, 112 and 113. 
However, as noted in the opposition, supplemental responses to these
requests have been provided well before the instant hearing date.  (Bertikian Decl. ¶ 15, Exh. O.)  Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.310 “[o]n receipt of a response
to a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party
may move for an order compelling further response to the demand”
[.]  (Id., [italics added].)  Here, as a further response has been provided,
there is nothing further to compel from the original response.  Accordingly, the instant motion is moot,
except as to sanctions.
 
Sanctions
Plaintiff request sanctions of $5,961.65 in bringing the instant
motion.  Plaintiff’s counsel claims an
hourly billing rate of $590 and claims to have spent 7 hours preparing the
instant motion and 4 hours review the opposition and preparing the reply.  (Gevorkian Decl. ¶ 16.)  In opposition, Defendant CSMC requests
sanctions of $6,805.00.  (Bertikian Decl.
¶¶ 17-20.)
For a motion to compel further responses,
“[t]he court shall impose a monetary sanction … against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
response to [request for production], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (CCP § 2031.300(c), [italics added].)  Further, it is an abuse of discovery to make
an evasive response or make unsubstantiated objections to discovery.  (CCP § 2023.010(e)-(f).)
Here, though the initial responses were only
objections, it does appear that some of these objections were warranted because
the discovery requests were overbroad. 
Further, given the quantity of discovery requests propounded by
Plaintiff, the delay in substantively responding is reasonable.  Moreover, the parties’ meet and confer
efforts and the fact that a substantive response provided – which was verified
the day the motion was filed – indicates that Defendant was going to provide
further responses regardless of the instant motion.  Though it is unclear why Plaintiff brought
the instant motion on August 30, 2023 – 20 days before the extended deadline --
without warning -- early, given the meet and confer efforts by the parties the Court concludes that the circumstances
make the imposition of sanctions on any party unjust. Accordingly, the requests
for sanctions are DENIED.
 
CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff Kristina
Holman’s motion to compel Defendant Cedars-Sinai Medical Center’s further
response to Request for Production, Set Three is DENIED AS MOOT.
The parties’ request for sanctions are DENIED. 
Moving Party is to
give notice and file proof of service of such.
