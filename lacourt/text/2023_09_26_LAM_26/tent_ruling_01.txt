There are several defects in the moving papers that Defense

The proof of service of the moving papers indicate
service by electronic and by mail, but no email address has been provided for
the Client.
 
Defense Counsel should at least attempt to speak to Client
to confirm the currentness of the address and file an amended declaration reflecting
attempts to confirm service by mail (with return receipt requested), by
telephone, and by conversation.
 
Defense Counsel should identify in general terms,
without violating attorney-client privilege, the general nature of the
breakdown in relationship.
 
The following changes should be made in the proposed
order 
-           In
item 7 (next scheduled hearing): “OSC re status of Defendant’s representation
set for November 9, 2023 at 8:30 am at 111 N. Hill Street, Dept. 26, L.A., CA
90012”;
 
 
-           In
item 9: In Item 9, Counsel must add the following language “Failure to appear
at trial will result in: (1) the Court deeming that Defendant waives
Defendant’s appearance for trial, (2) the trial proceeding in Defendant’s
absence, (3) the entry of judgment against Defendant in any amount of damages
proven at trial, and (4) dismissal of the Cross-Complaint.”
 
-           Additional
language for Item 13: “A corporation must be represented by licensed counsel in
proceedings before this Court. Defendant is ordered to file a substitution of
counsel within 14 days of service of this signed order and to appear on 11/9/23
at 8:30 am in Department 26 with its new counsel.  Defendant’s failure to timely retain new
counsel or failure to appear on 11/9/23 may result in the answer being
stricken, the entry of default and default judgment against Defendant, and the
dismissal of the cross-complaint.  Moving
Counsel is ordered to file proof of service of this signed order on all parties
within 2 days.”
 
The moving party must give notice of this order to all
parties, including overnight mail service on his client Defendant Kedren
Community Health Center Inc, and file proof of service of such by September 27,
2023.
