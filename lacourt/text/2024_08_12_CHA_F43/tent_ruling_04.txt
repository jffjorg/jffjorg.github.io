SUMMARY OF
ACTION AND ANALYSIS
On March 21,
2024, the arbitrator in this case entered a final award of $99,475.10 in favor
of Petitioner Bill Me Later, Inc. (Petitioner). 
 
The final award
consisted of the following: $90,450.10 for the principal under the agreement;
$5,750.00 in attorney fees; and $3,275.00 in costs and arbitration fees. 
 
Petitioner
filed this petition pursuant to CCP §§ 1286 and 1287.4, which allow the Court
to confirm the arbitration award and enter judgment in conformity with the
award. None of the conditions outlined in CCP § 1286.2 that would require the
vacation of the award are present.
 
Petitioner has
also requested 10% per annum interest pursuant to “C.C.P. § 3389(b).” However,
no such section exists in the Code of Civil Procedure. However, it is likely
that Petitioner meant Civ. Code § 3289(b), which states “If a contract entered
into after January 1, 1986, does not stipulate a legal rate of interest, the
obligation shall bear interest at a rate of 10 percent per annum after a
breach.” Furthermore, interest is allowable pursuant to Civ. Code § 3287. (See Glassman
v. Safeco Ins. Co. of America (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 1281, 1319.)
 
The Court
orders the award confirmed, and judgment is entered in favor of Petitioner in
the amount of $99,475.10, plus interest. Petitioner is ordered to submit a
proposed judgment based on an interest rate of 10 percent per annum accruing
since April 21, 2024.
 
Moving party to
give notice.
