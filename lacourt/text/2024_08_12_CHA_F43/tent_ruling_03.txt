SUMMARY OF ACTION 
On September 5, 2023, Golden Hammer Ops, LLC (Golden
Hammer) filed the complaint that began this action. Golden Hammer filed that
complaint against JETNET, LLC (JETNET) and two other Defendants. Golden Hammer
alleged causes of action for Misappropriation of Trade Secrets, Intentional
Interference with Contractual Relations, and Violation of California Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act against JETNET.
 
On October 30, 2023, JETNET filed a cross-complaint
against Golden Hammer and Gregory Rowlee (Rowlee). JETNET alleges three causes
of action for Breach of Contract, Intentional Interference with Contractual
Relations, and Declaratory Relief. In JETNET’s Cross-Complaint, JETNET alleges
that Golden Hammer and Rowlee breached an agreement between the two parties and
interfered with JETNET’s contract with another party, AWS.
 
On December 6, 2023, Rowlee and Goldener Hammer
(Cross-Complainants), rather than amending the original complaint to add Rowlee
as a plaintiff, filed a cross-complaint against JETNET and ADSBExchange.com
(ADSB). The cross-complaint alleged four causes of action for (1) Breach of the
Services Agreement (against ADSB Exchange); (2) Breach of the Hosting Agreement
and the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing (against JETNET); (3) Declaratory
Relief (against both Cross-Defendants); and (4) Reformation of Written
Instrument. Rowlee and Golden Hammer alleged that JETNET breached an agreement
between the parties by failing to disclose that JETNET did not acquire the
Services Agreement during its acquisition of ADSB.
 
After this Court sustained JETNET’s demurrer to the
original cross-complaint, ADSB agreed to take its demurrer off calendar, and
Rowlee and Golden Hammer filed their First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC) on
June 12, 2024, against JETNET and ADSB. The FACC alleges four causes of action
for (1) Fraud and Conspiracy to Commit Fraud; (2) Breach of the Implied
Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (3) Declaratory Relief; and (4)
Reformation of Written Instrument.
 
ADSB filed its demurrer to the FACC on July 12, 2024. Rowlee
and Golden Hammer oppose the demurrer.
 
ADSB’s Request for Judicial Notice: ADSB has requested
that the Court take judicial of Golden Hammer’s original complaint filed on
September 5, 2023. The Court takes judicial notice of this document.
 
ANALYSIS
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for
which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which
the court may take judicial notice. (CCP § 430.30(a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.) The purpose of a demurrer is to challenge the sufficiency of a pleading
“by raising questions of law.” (Postley
v. Harvey (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 280, 286.) “In the construction of a
pleading, for the purpose of determining its effect, its allegations must be
liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.” (CCP
§ 452.) The court “ ‘ “treat[s] the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law…”
’ ” (Berkley v. Dowds (2007) 152
Cal.App.4th 518, 525.) In applying these standards, the court liberally
construes the complaint to determine whether a cause of action has been stated.
(Picton v. Anderson Union High School
Dist. (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 726, 733.)
 
First Cause of Action for Fraud
and Conspiracy to Commit Fraud
ADSB demurs to the First Cause of Action for Fraud and
Conspiracy to Commit Fraud on the basis that it does not plead fact sufficient
to constitute a cause of action.
 
ADSB argues that this cause of action is superseded by the
California Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA) because it is premised on the same
nucleus of facts as Cross-Complainants’ trade secret misappropriation claim and
because it is dependent on the trade secret misappropriation allegations.
 
CUTSA supersedes other civil remedies based upon the same
nucleus of facts as a claim for trade secret misappropriation. (See Silvaco
Data Systems v. Intel Corp. (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 210, 236.) Causes of
action that follow the logic of a trade secret misappropriation claim are
governed exclusively by trade secret law. (See Coast Hematology-Oncology
Assoc. Med. Group, Inc. v. Long Beach Mem. Med. Ctr. (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th
748, 769-770.)
 
Cross-Complainants argue in their opposition that this cause
of action is not superseded by CUTSA because it does not arise from the same
nucleus of facts as their claim for trade secret misappropriation. 
 
Whether or not the claim for fraud should be displaced
depends on whether it falls within one the enumerated categories of exclusion.
(Civ. Code § 3426.7(b).) In particular, the Court will need to determine
whether the fraud claim is “based upon misappropriation of a trade secret.” (Id.).
The Court of Appeal clarified that “[C]UTSA does not displace noncontract
claims that, although related to a trade secret misappropriation, are
independent and based on facts distinct from the facts that support the misappropriation
claim.” (Angelica Textile Services, Inc. v. Park (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th
495, 506.) This determination, it noted, “is largely factual.” (Id. at
505.) If a claim has “a basis independent of any misappropriation of a trade
secret,” then it survives displacement. (Id. at 507 [reversing a trial
court’s finding that CUTSA displaced plaintiff’s breach of contract, breach of
fiduciary duty, unfair competition, interference with business relations, and
conversion claims].)
 
Cross-Complainants argue that there are allegations under
their fraud cause of action that are separate from their trade secret
misappropriation claims. The FACC does allege that Mr. Streufert of ADSB
tortiously deceived Golden Hammer by making false statements regarding JETNET’s
acquisition of its contracts with Golden Hammer. (FACC, ¶ 81.) Alternatively,
the FACC alleges that Mr. Streufert of ADSB tortiously deceived Golden Hammer
by providing only partial details regarding the acquisition but withholding
other material facts in manner which rendered its partial disclosure deceptive.
(FACC, ¶ 82.) Neither of these allegations appear to be related to trade secret
misappropriation, as they are both related to the acquisition of the contracts.
 
As for the other elements of fraud, a fraud cause of action
requires a plaintiff to plead and prove: “(a) [a] misrepresentation (false
representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or
“scienter”); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable
reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12
Cal 4th 631, 638.) Fraud causes of action must be pled with specificity. “…This
particularity requirement necessitates pleading facts which ‘show how, when,
where, to whom and by what means the representations were tendered.’” (Stansfield
v. Starkey (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 59, 73, quoting Hills Trans. Co. v.
Southwest (1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 702, 707.) 
 
Fraud claims against a corporation must “allege the names of
the persons who made the allegedly fraudulent representations, their authority
to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or
written.” (Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2
Cal.App.4th 153, 157.) 
 
All of the elements are present in the FACC. Cross-Complainants
have alleged that there were misrepresentations (FACC, ¶¶ 81-82); that there
was knowledge of the falsity (FACC, ¶ 81-83); that the intended to defraud them
(FACC, ¶ 88); that there was justifiable reliance (FACC, ¶ 88); and that Golden
Hammer was harmed (FACC, ¶¶ 90, 92.) Additionally, the FACC alleged how, when,
where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered, and it
alleges who made the representations on behalf of ADSB.
 
As for ADSB’s arguments concerning Mr. Streufert, the FACC
clearly alleges that he was the sole owner and manager of ADSB. (FACC, ¶ 72.)
While he may have also been working on behalf of JETNET, that does not override
his ownership of ADSB.
 
ADSB’s demurrer to the First Cause of Action is overruled.
 
Second Cause of Action for
Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
ADSB demurs to Rowlee and Golden Hammer’s Second Cause of
Action for Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing on the
basis that it does not plead facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
 
The covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied by
law in every contract. (Avidity Partners, LLC v. State of California
(2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 1180, 1204.) It is read into contracts “to protect the
express covenants or promises of the contract, not to protect some general
public policy interest not directly tied to the contract’s purpose.” (Id.)
It exists merely to prevent one party from unfairly frustrating the other
party’s “right to receive the benefits of the agreement actually made.”
(Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 317, 349, emphasis in the
original.) “It cannot impose substantive duties or limits on the contracting
parties beyond those incorporated in the specific terms of their agreement.” (Id.
at 349-350.)
 
The FACC alleges that the Services and Hosting Agreements at
issue contained an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing requiring
ADSB to “honestly report the assignment status of both agreements, and not to
mislead Golden Hammer into providing an assignee of only the Hosting Agreement
with benefits under both.” (Opposition at p. 13; FACC, ¶ 101.) However, neither
the Services or Hosting Agreement contain an express or implied provision that
require ADSB to disclose the terms of an asset sale. (Demurrer at pp.12-13.)
ADSB argues that Cross-Complainants are trying to add these terms
retroactively. 
 
However, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing
“cannot impose substantive duties or limits on the contracting parties beyond
those incorporated in the specific terms of their agreement.” (Guz v.
Bechtel Nat. Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 317, 349-350.) ADSB also argues that
nothing about its action unfairly frustrated Cross-Complainant’ “right to
receive the benefits of the agreement actually made.” (Id. at 349.) The
allegations in the FACC do not indicate that there were any benefits from the
agreement actually made that they did not receive.
 
ADSB’s demurrer to the Second Cause of Action is sustained
with leave to amend.
 
CONCLUSION
ADSB’s demurrer is overruled for the First Cause of Action
and sustained with leave to amend for the Second Cause of Action.
 
Rowlee and Golden Hammer are given 30 days leave to amend.
