And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to enforce the settlement agreement between the parties. The parties had reached a settlement at a mandatory settlement conference on September 26, 2024, which is memorialized in a Minute Order. The settlement terms include: plaintiffs paying defendants the balance of outstanding attorney's fees, reimbursements, exchange of property, and Pastor Goodman's resignation. The judge notes that a judge hearing a section 664.6 motion cannot create the material terms of a settlement, but rather can only decide on the terms that the parties have previously agreed upon. The plaintiffs cannot avoid the settlement they agreed to and must comply with the terms.
