Discussion

 
            Superior Grocers served
Cross-Defendant Assetan Stylla (Stylla) with the relevant discovery on
10/4/2023. Responses were therefore due on 11/7/2023. To date, no responses
have been received. 
 
            Stylla did not oppose the motion,
and thus has not set forth any substantial justification for the failure to
respond. 
 
            Based on the foregoing, Superior
Grocers motions to compel initial discovery and have its RFAs deemed admitted
are granted. Plaintiff, who is representing herself in pro per, is
sanctioned $350.00 per motion ($350/hr x 1 hr), for a total of $1,400. 
 
It is so
ordered.
