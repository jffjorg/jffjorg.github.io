CASE:                         Monica Garcia Garcia v. American Honda
Motor Co. 
 
CASE NO.:                 24STCV19227            
 
MOTION
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION (SET ONE); REQUEST FOR
SANCTIONS

 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff Monica Garcia Garcia
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): Defendant American
Honda Motor Co. 
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a lemon law action filed on August 1, 2024. Plaintiff purchased a
2022 Honda HR-V on June 1, 2022, which subsequently manifested electrical,
engine, and transmission defects. 
 
Plaintiff moves to compel further
responses to requests for production propounded to Defendant, and for
sanctions. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel
Further Responses to Requests for Production is GRANTED.
 
            Defendant
is ordered to provide verified, code-compliant supplemental responses without
objections within 30 days of this order. 
 
            Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $2,153.50 against
Defendant and its counsel, jointly and severally. Payment is to be made from
Defendant or its counsel to Plaintiff’s counsel within 20 days of this order. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
            Plaintiff
moves to compel further responses to requests for production propounded to
Defendant. 
Legal Standard
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (a), a court
may order a party to serve a further response to a demand for inspection when
the court finds that: “(1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete[;] (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive[; or] (3) An objection in the response is without merit
or too general.”
 
The burden is on the moving party to “set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (b)(1).) These facts must also be set forth in a separate
statement filed by the moving party. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1345(c).) This
burden “is met simply by a fact-specific showing of relevance.” (TBG Ins.
Servs. Corp. v. Superior Court (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)
 
Timeliness
 
A motion to compel further
responses to requests for production must be served “within 45 days of the
service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified response, or on
or before any specific later date to which the propounding party and the responding
party have agreed in writing.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 2031.310(c).) The 45-day
requirement is mandatory and jurisdictional. (Sexton v. Superior Court¿(1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
            Plaintiff propounded the discovery
at issue in this motion on September 17, 2024. (Declaration of Roy Enav ISO
Mot. ¶ 14; Exh. 3). Defendant provided responses on November 4, 2024, pursuant
to an agreed-upon extension of time to respond to that date. (Enav Decl. Exh.
4; Declaration of Ariane A. Sadanaga ¶ 6; Exh. C.) The deadline to bring a
motion to compel further responses was therefore December 19, 2024. Plaintiff
filed and served the motion on December 13, 2024, one week before the deadline.
This motion is timely. 
 
Meet and Confer
 
A party making a motion to compel further responses must also include a
declaration stating facts showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to
resolve informally the issues presented by the motion before filing the motion.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2016.040, 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)
 
            The Declaration of Roy Enav filed in
support of this motion states that the parties exchanged meet and confer
letters between November 12, 2024 and November 18, 2024, followed by a
telephone conference on November 22, 2024. (Enav Decl. ¶¶ 17-19; Exhs. 5-7.)
The Court therefore finds that Plaintiff has satisfied the statutory meet-and-confer
process.
 
//
Good Cause
 
            Plaintiff
moves to compel further responses to 31 requests for production propounded to
Defendant. These requests fall into four broad categories: (1) materials
relating directly to the vehicle that is the subject of this action; (2)
Defendant’s policies and procedures relating to Song-Beverly claims; (3)
Defendant’s policies and procedures relating to warranty claims; and (4)
materials relating to similar issues in vehicles of the same year, make and
model as the subject vehicle. 
 
1.     
Materials Relating to the Subject Vehicle
(Requests Nos. 1-14)
 
Requests Nos. 1 through 14 seek (1)
documents relating to the subject vehicle within Defendant’s Customer Relations
Center; (2) documents relating to Defendant’s Answer to the Complaint; (3-4)
documents relating to inspections or repair orders pertaining to the subject
vehicle; (5-6) documents relating to the lease or purchase of the vehicle; (7)
documents relating to diagnostic trouble codes stored by Defendant or its
repair facility as a result of any inspections or repairs conducted on the
subject vehicle; (8) documents issued for subject vehicle, including recalls,
TSBs, and dealer advisories; (9) documents relating to communications between
Defendant and its repair facility relating to the vehicle; (10-11) documents
relating to summaries of warranty repairs and amounts paid for those repairs on
the vehicle; (12) photos or video of the vehicle; (13) documents relating to
communications between Defendant and Plaintiff; and (14) documents relating to
any communications with third parties regarding the vehicle. (See Enav Decl.
Exh. 3 Nos. 1-14.) 
 
            These
materials are facially relevant to this action, as they pertain to the vehicle
itself, as in Requests Nos. 1, 3-6, 8 through 12, and 14; to the pleadings
themselves, as in Request No. 2, or to communications between the parties, as
in Request No. 13. The Court therefore finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated
good cause for these requests.
 
2.     
Policies and Procedures Relating to Song-Beverly
Claims (Requests Nos. 15-22)
 
Requests Nos. 15 through 22 seek:  (15) documents relating to Defendant’s rules,
policies, or procedures since 2020 regarding refunds or replacements under the
Song-Beverly Act; (16-17) documents relating to call center policies for
escalating customer complaints and creating Service Activities; (18) documents
relating to policies and procedures for determining whether vehicles should be
repurchased or replaced; (19-20) documents relating to flow charts for
escalating complaints or evaluating whether vehicles qualify for repurchase or
replacement; (21) documents relating to training materials for calculation of
repurchases, and (22) documents relating to policies or procedures to advise
customers to deliver vehicles for further diagnosis or repair, rather than
offering repurchase or replacement. (Enav Decl. Exh. 3 Nos. 15-22.) Materials
concerning corporate policies and practices relating to reacquisition of
vehicles are admissible. (E.g., Johnson v. Ford Motor Co. (2005) 35
Cal.4th 1191, 1198-99; Oregel v. American Isuzu Motors, Inc. (2001) 90
Cal.App.4th 1094, 1104-1105.) Admissible evidence is discoverable. (Glenfed
Development Corp. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117-18.)
Plaintiff has therefore demonstrated good cause for these requests.
 
3.     
Policies and Procedures Relating to Warranty
Claims (Requests Nos. 23-29)
 
Requests Nos. 23 through 29 seek
documents relating to Defendant’s policies and procedures regarding coverage
requirements and limitations under warranty, including coverage of repairs
(Enav Decl. Exh. 3 Nos. 23-26; 28), length of test drives required for coverage
(No. 27) and procedures where customer concerns are not duplicated at the time
of the repair visit (No. 29.) These materials are relevant to whether
Defendant’s internal policies erected obstacles to obtaining redress under the
Song-Beverly Act, which goes to whether Defendant acted in good faith. (Oregel,
supra, 90 Cal. App.4th 1094, 1104-1105.) Plaintiff has therefore
demonstrated good cause for these requests. 
 
4.     
Similar Issues in Similar Vehicles
 
Request No. 30 seeks documents
relating to other customer complaints, including reported system, malfunction,
trouble code, TSB, indicators, or other failure, matching those described in
any warranty summary or repair order for the subject vehicle in other 2022
Honda HR-V vehicles. (Enav Decl. Exh. 3 No. 30.) Request No. 31 seeks any
documents relating to any “Field Service Action” that has been or is being
issued in response to complaints experienced by Plaintiff. (No. 31.) 
 
Evidence of similar defects in
other vehicles are both relevant and admissible. (Donlen v. Ford Motor Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 138, 153.) Admissible evidence is discoverable. (Glenfed
Development Corp. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1117-18.)
Documents regarding warranty complaints, service histories, and employee
records concerning a defect in all affected vehicles, as well as documents
regarding the manufacturer’s responses and instructions to cure that defect are
discoverable. (See Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th
967, 971 [holding that the trial court’s approval of a discovery referee’s
report and recommendation of sanctions for failure to produce documents of this
nature relating to the subject defect in all affected vehicles was not an abuse
of discretion].) 
 
Defendant asserts that Request No.
30 is overbroad because, by its terms, the request inquires into alleged
conditions which were presented to Defendant for repair at least once. Under
the Song-Beverly Act, a plaintiff must have provided the manufacturer with more
than one opportunity to repair the vehicle. (Silvio v. Ford Motor Co. (2003)
109 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1207.) Thus, Defendant argues, documents relating to
issues for which the vehicle was only presented one time are not relevant,
because those defects could not support a Song-Beverly claim as a matter of
law. Defendant’s argument is self-defeating, as discoverable information is any
information “relevant to the subject matter,” in that it might reasonably
assist a party in evaluating its case, preparing for trial, or facilitating
settlement. (Gonzalez v. Super Ct. (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546.) Materials
which relate to the potential universe of claims necessarily are of use in
evaluating a party’s case. The Court is therefore not persuaded that this
request is overbroad. 
 
Defendant also contends
that Donlen and Doppes are both distinguishable from the present
case: Donlen because the issue was whether the plaintiff’s expert
testimony regarding defects in and special service bulletins relating to other
vehicles was inadmissible, rather than production of documents relating to
these issues (Donlen, supra, 217 Cal.App.4th at 138), and Doppes
because that case was also an action for fraud, and the manufacturer did not
challenge the discovery referee’s findings. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at 973-74, 993.) Defendant is correct that these cases are
factually distinguishable, but the Court disagrees with Defendant that these
cases do not support the position that the documents sought are relevant and
admissible. In Doppes, the Court of Appeal expressly held that the trial
court did not abuse its discretion in adopting the discovery referee’s report
and recommendation. (Doppes, supra, at 971.) Further, expert testimony
as in Donlen regarding documentary evidence must necessarily have a
foundation in that evidence to be admissible. (Cooper v. Takeda
Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. (2015) 239 Cal.App.4th 555, 577.)  Documentary evidence on which an expert is
testifying must therefore be discoverable. (Glenfed, supra, 53
Cal.App.4th at 1117-18.) 
 
As Plaintiff seeks materials which
are discoverable pursuant to Donlen and Doppes, the Court finds
that Plaintiff has demonstrated good cause for these requests. 
 
Defendant’s Responses
 
            In response
to each request, Defendant asserted the same series of objections that the
requests are vague, ambiguous, overbroad, fail to describe with reasonably
particularity the documents begin sought, invade attorney-client privilege or
seek protected work product, seek confidential, sensitive, or proprietary
information, or ask Defendant to respond on behalf of any other entity. (See,
e.g., Enav Decl. Exh. 4. No. 1.) With respect to Requests Nos. 1 through 6, 9
through 14, and 16, Defendant agreed to produce any documents in its
possession, custody, or control “to which no objection was being made.” (E.g.
Enav Decl. Exh. 4. No. 1.) With respect to Requests Nos. 7, 8, 12, 15, 17
through 22, 27, 29, and 31, Defendant stated that subject to the objections,
it was unable to comply with each request because no responsive documents
were in its possession, custody, or control. (E.g. Enav Decl. Exh. 4. No. 7.)
With respect to Requests Nos. 23 through 26, Defendant stated, again subject to
objections, that Defendant had no responsive documents, but also agreed to
produce confidential materials which it contends were not responsive subject to
a protective order. (E.g. No. 23.) With respect to Request No. 30, however,
Defendant made no production. 
 
            At the
outset, Defendant fails to address any of its objections beyond its general contention
that the requests are vague, ambiguous, and not reasonably particularized and
its specific contention that Request No. 30 is not reasonably calculated to
lead to admissible evidence because it does not seek relevant information. The
Court therefore finds that Defendant has not justified its unaddressed
objections. 
 
            With
respect to Defendant’s assertion that the requests are vague, ambiguous, and
not reasonably particularized, the Court is unpersuaded. Contrary to
Defendant’s contention, the requests are not so broadly phrased that Defendant
could not be expected to understand what materials are being sought. That the
Court was able to determine the relevance of these materials supports this
conclusion. Further, as to Defendant’s relevance objection, that contention is
without merit for the reasons stated above. 
 
            Finally,
Defendant claims that its responses are code-compliant because Defendant
identified and produced responsive documents or stated when no documents were
available. That contention is specious. Defendant responded subject to
its objections, and only identified and produced documents to which no
objection was made. As Defendant’s objections are without merit, Defendant’s
production is necessarily incomplete. 
 
            The Court
therefore finds that Plaintiff is entitled to an order compelling further
responses to all the requests at issue.
 
Sanctions
 
            Plaintiff
also requests sanctions against Defendant and its counsel, jointly and
severally, in the amount of $4,029.75.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 authorizes the Court to impose
monetary sanctions on any attorney engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process by requiring that attorney to pay the reasonable expenses incurred by
anyone because of that conduct. Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310(h)
requires the Court to impose sanctions against any party who unsuccessfully
makes or opposes a motion to compel further response, unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
            Here,
Plaintiff requests sanctions of $4,029.75, accounting for 7.05 hours of
attorney time actually incurred at $395 per hour, plus 3 hours of anticipated
in preparing a reply and attending the hearing on this matter, plus $60 in filing
fees. (Enav Decl. ¶¶ 24-25.) The Court declines to award attorney’s fees based
on anticipated hours not actually incurred. Moreover, Plaintiff is seeking to
recover 1.75 hours for reviewing the responses and preparing meet-and-confer
correspondence. (Enav Decl. ¶ 24.) Time reviewing the responses was required
whether the responses were sufficient or not, and therefore was not incurred
“as a result” of any misuse of discovery by Defendant. Similarly, time spent
preparing meet-and-confer correspondence was not incurred “as a result” of
Defendant’s conduct because that time would have been incurred even if the
parties informally resolved any disagreement. The Court therefore awards
reduced attorney’s fees in the amount of $2,153.50, representing 5.3
hours of attorney time incurred in preparing this motion at $395 per hour, plus
$60 in filing fees, against Defendant and its counsel, jointly and severally. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production is
GRANTED.
 
            Defendant
is ordered to provide verified, code-compliant supplemental responses without
objections within 30 days of this order. 
 
            Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $2,153.50 against
Defendant and its counsel, jointly and severally. Payment is to be made from
Defendant or its counsel to Plaintiff’s counsel within 20 days of this order. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
