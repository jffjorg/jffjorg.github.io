And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel responses to special interrogatories and requests for production filed by the Defendant, Bristol Central SPE, LLC, et al. The Defendant has moved to compel responses to these requests, citing the Plaintiff's failure to respond despite proper service. The Court has granted the motion, ordering the Plaintiff to provide verified and code-compliant responses without objections within 20 days.

The Court has also granted the Defendant's request for sanctions, imposing a total amount of $725 against the Plaintiff and its attorney, Jason Eric Guerra, jointly and severally. This sanction is for the Defendant's reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred as a result of the Plaintiff's failure to respond.

The Court's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and the California Rules of Court, which provide for the compulsory imposition of sanctions when a party fails to respond to discovery requests. The Court has applied these laws to the facts of the case, finding that the Plaintiff's failure to respond was unjustified and that the Defendant is entitled to the relief sought.
