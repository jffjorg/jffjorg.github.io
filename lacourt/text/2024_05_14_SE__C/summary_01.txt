And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denied the plaintiff's motion for sanctions, which sought to impose penalties on the defendant for failing to comply with a court order to provide discovery. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant had disobeyed the court's order and had not provided relevant witnesses and information relating to other alleged misconduct by the defendant's employee, Kyle Collett. The defendant claimed that it had provided amended responses to the request for special interrogatories and had acted in good faith by providing responses and documentary evidence. The court found that the defendant had failed to comply with the court's order, but had subsequently provided further responses. The court denied the motion for sanctions, finding that the defendant had attempted to rectify its prior non-compliance and that the plaintiff had not met and conferred with the defendant before filing the motion.
