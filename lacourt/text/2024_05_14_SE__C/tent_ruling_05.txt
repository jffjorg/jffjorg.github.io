Plaintiff to give notice. 
 
This action alleges that Defendant General Motors, Inc.
(“Defendant”) violated California Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act
(“Song-Beverly Act”) by failing to repair Plaintiff Victor A. Batres’s
(“Plaintiff”) 2021 GMC Yukon XL vehicle (the “Subject Vehicle”). During the
warranty period, the Subject Vehicle contained or developed numerous defects
that Defendant’s authorized repair facility was unable to conform to warranty.
On July 27, 2023, Plaintiff served his first set of Request
for Production and Special Interrogatories upon Defendant. (Decl. Chae ¶11, Ex.
6.) On August 25, 2023, GM served its unverified responses to Plaintiff’s
Special Interrogatories. (Decl. Chae ¶12, Ex. 7). Verifications were
subsequently electronically served on September 21, 2023. (Id. at ¶15, Ex. 9).
Plaintiff contends the responses were insufficient. 
The Court is not persuaded that counsel have exhausted
their meet and confer obligations pursuant to the Code. Counsel are advised
that their meet and confer efforts should go beyond merely sending letters
stating their respective positions. (See Townsend v. Superior Court (1998) 61
Cal.App.4th 1431, 1439.) “A determination of whether an attempt at informal
resolution is adequate…involves the exercise of discretion. The level of effort
at an informal resolution which satisfies the ‘reasonable and good faith
attempt’ standard depends upon the circumstances. In a larger, more complex
discovery request, a greater effort at informal resolution may be warranted. In
a simpler, or more narrowly focused case, a more modest effort may suffice. The
history of the litigation, the nature of the interaction between counsel, the
nature of the issues, the type and scope of the discovery requested, the
prospects for success and other similar factors can be relevant. Judges have
broad powers and responsibilities to determine what measures and procedures are
appropriate in varying circumstances.” (Obregon v. Sup. Ct. (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 424, 431.)
In Opposition, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs filed the
instant motion before the parties had an opportunity to the meet and confer.
Defendants assert that they requested Plaintiff’s availability to further meet
and confer, but that Plaintiffs instead filed the instant motion. (Chase Decl.,
Ex. 12, 14, 16, and 18.)
Plaintiff Victor A. Batres’s Motions to Compel Further
Responses to Special Interrogatories (Set One) and Requests for Production (Set
One) is CONTINUED to July 30, 2024 at 10:30 a.m. in Department SE-C.  Counsel are ORDERED to make further efforts to
resolve the issues presented. If, after exhausting those efforts, court
intervention is needed, counsel may appear and argue the merits on the
continued hearing date. If counsel are unable to informally resolve their
discovery disputes, then counsel are instructed to submit a JOINT STATEMENT
with a detailed outline of the remaining disputed issues for which a ruling is
required. Counsel are also strongly advised to review the standing CMC order
issued in Department F for guidance on the manner to handle disputed items. The
joint statement must be FILED on or before July 23, 2024 at noon.
