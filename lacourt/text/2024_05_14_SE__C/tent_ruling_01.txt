Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiff Wesley Patterson’s Request for
Sanctions is DENIED. 
Defendant to give notice. 
 
Background 
Plaintiff’s Complaint alleges that on April 23, 2020,
Plaintiff Wesley Patterson (“Plaintiff”) was admitted to Defendant College
Medical Center (“Defendant”) following a WIC § 5150 hold. Plaintiff was
unconscious. When Plaintiff woke up the next day, April 24, 2020, he was
disoriented and repeatedly asked two orderlies where he was. Plaintiff alleges
the two orderlies shoved Plaintiff, and repeatedly punched Plaintiff’s face and
body. Plaintiff has a history of manic depression. (Compl. ¶¶ 12- 13.) Plaintiff
alleges significant mental suffering and emotional distress because of the
abuse. (Compl. ¶ 26.) Plaintiff brings causes of action for Dependent Adult
Abuse and Neglect, Professional Medical Negligence, Battery, Assault, False
Imprisonment, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, and Vicarious
Liability. 
On June 3, 2022, Plaintiff Amended the Complaint to include
Defendants Kyle Collett and Eder Amaya (previously Doe Defendants) who
Plaintiff alleges are the two orderlies who assaulted him.  
On November 29, 2023, this Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set Two, specifically
as to Nos. 9-20, 27 and 28, in part. 
On January 10, 2024, Defendant’s request for Temporary Stay
Order was granted by the Court of Appeal as to Special Interrogatories Nos. 9,
11, 15, 17, 27 and 28. 
 
On January 29, 2024, Defendant served responses to the Special
Interrogatories which are not subject to the Temporary Stay Order: Nos. 10,
12-14, 16 and 18-20. (McGrath Decl., ¶ 4.) 
On March 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion for
sanctions arguing Defendant had not reasonably provided further responses to Special
Interrogatories Nos. 10, 12-14, 16, and 18-20: 
SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 10: Please IDENTIFY by name and
last known contact information of all of YOUR employees as of April 13, 2016,

bates stamped as "Ex. B-010".
SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 12: Please IDENTIFY by name and
last known contact information of all of YOUR employees as of April 7, 2016,

SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 13: Please IDENTIFY by name and
last known contact information of any and all potential witnesses with

bates stamped as "Ex. B-006".
SPECIAL INTERROGATORY NO. 18: Please IDENTIFY the last

patient assault in April 2016; (2) issue sanctions designating the fact that
College Medical Center staff knew of Collett’s involvement in a prior patient

disputing the fact that Defenant knew of Collet’s involvement in a prior
patient assault in April 2017; (5) Attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by

Legal Standard 
Where a party engages in misuse of the discovery process,
the court may impose monetary, issue, evidence, terminating, or contempt
sanctions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) “Misuses of the discovery process
include, but are not limited to, the following: [¶] (g) [d]isobeying a court
order to provide discovery.” (CCP § 2023.010.) 
California Code Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 2023.010(g)
makes “disobeying a court order to provide discovery” a “misuse of the
discovery process” for which a court may impose monetary sanctions. (Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377.)  Excluding contempt proceedings,
“disobedience” with a court order does not require a showing of “willful”
disobedience; rather, failure to obey (i.e., noncompliance with the court's order)
is all that need be shown. (See Puritan Ins. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Tri-C Machine
Corp.) (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 877, 884.)
Discussion 
Plaintiff contends that Defendant disobeyed a November 29,
2023 Court order by failing to produce relevant witnesses and information
relating to other alleged misconduct by Defendant Collet. Plaintiff maintains
that Defendant has continued to serve boilerplate objections and has refused to
identify any knowledgeable employees despite having previously investigated the
incident and suspended Collett. (Culpepper Decl., Ex. 2) Moreover, Plaintiff
contends that Defendant can comply with the Court’s order by performing a
reasonable inquiry into its daily shift schedules. (Culpepper Decl., Ex. 3.) Plaintiff
contends Defendant failed to exercise diligence by claiming ignorance of any
potential witnesses or documents relating to Collett’s falsification of records
on April 7. 2016 (Special Interrogatories Nos. 12, 13, and 14), then producing
contradictory evidence from their own employment records showing an
investigation into Collett's actions. (Culpepper Decl., Ex. 2.) Further,
Plaintiff argues that attempts to discover information about another assault
involving Collett on April 6, 2017 (Special Interrogatories Nos. 16 and 18) were
thwarted by the Defendant's evasive “Unknown” responses, despite evidence from
its disciplinary files revealing which employees witnessed and/or participated
in the assault. (Culpepper Decl., Ex. 2.) 
In opposition, Defendant contends it has served amended
responses to the request for special interrogatories.  Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s motion
ignores its efforts to participate in discovery in good faith, including the production
of Defendant’s supplemental responses and document production that were timely
provided in compliance with the Court’s order. Defendant maintains it has
substantially complied with the Court’s order and acted in good faith by
providing responses and supplemental responses to discovery requests and
providing documents and supplemental document production on January 29, 2024
per the Court’s order. (Culpepper Decl., Ex. 8.) Defendant avers that Plaintiff
never conveyed that he found Defendant’s previous interrogatory responses
deficient. Therefore, Defendant argues if Plaintiff met and conferred with Defendant
it would have resulted in an informal resolution of the outstanding discovery. Lastly,
Defendant argues that it has further supplemented its responses with further
verified supplemental responses filed together with Defendant’s Opposition on
May 1, 2024.
In reply, Plaintiff contends his discovery requests were straightforward.
He argues Defendant was aware of prior acts of the two Defendant employees and
could have easily gathered their contact information from its administrative or
payroll files. 
The Court determines that Defendant College Medical Center has
failed to comply with the November 29, 2023 Court order.  Defendant’s further responses served on
January 29, 2024 contain boilerplate objections and the responses to Special Interrogatories
Nos. 19 and 20 are identical to the original responses. Therefore, the Court
finds that Defendant did not act with diligence in the creation of its further
responses. 
The fact that Defendant may have misunderstood its
obligations under the November 29, 2023 Court Order does not amount to
"substantial justification” which excuses sanctions.  Relevant case law provides that an inadvertent
failure to comply does not relieve a party from exposure to discretionary sanctions.
(Reedy v. Bussell (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1272, 1291 (“willfulness is no
longer a requirement for the imposition of discovery sanctions. That
requirement was dropped from Code of Civil Procedure section 2023, subdivision
(b), as part of the Civil Discovery Act of 1986.”).) 
The Court may impose sanctions “appropriate to the dereliction
and should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the
party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43
Cal. App. 4th 1525, 1545, 51 (disapproved of on other grounds by City of Los
Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC, supra, 84 Cal.App.5th at p. 510).) Because
Defendant has subsequently provided further responses, the Court finds it has
attempted to rectify its prior non-compliance with the November 29, 2023 Court
Order.  Issue and evidentiary sanctions against
Defendant are not warranted.  
Determining whether to impose monetary sanctions is a
closer call.  Plaintiff requests monetary
sanctions in the amount of $3,867.50 (for 6.5 hours drafting the pleadings
related to this motion at a rate of $595.00). (Culpepper Decl., ¶ 13.)  Ultimately, the Court is persuaded not to
impose monetary sanctions considering Defendant’s claim that Plaintiff did not
meet and confer before filing the instant motion and further responses have
been provided.    
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion for sanctions is
DENIED.
