And here is the English-text summary:

In this tentative ruling, the Court has ruled in favor of the Plaintiff, Abner Hinojos, and against the Defendant, Omar Deniz, in an unlawful detainer action. The Defendant demurred to the Complaint, arguing that it fails to state a cause of action for Unlawful Detainer, and that the Complaint is vague and ambiguous. However, the Court finds that the Complaint adequately alleges that the Defendant was in default when the Five-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit was served. Therefore, the Court has overruled the Defendant's demurrer.
