Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiff Jorge Ruiz’s Motion to Compel Compliance
with the Court’s October 10, 2023 Discovery Order is DENIED.
Defendant to give notice. 
No Reply filed as of May 10, 2024.
 
Background 
This is a breach of warranty action involving Plaintiff’s
purchase of a 2017 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 (“Subject Vehicle”). 
On October 10, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents (Set One) as
to Requests Nos. 17, 23, 24, 25, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 ,45, 50,
51, 52, 53, 58, 59, 68, and 91. (Stoliker Decl., Ex. 1; Kay Decl., ¶ 2.)
On December 08, 2023, GM served supplemental responses. (Stoliker
Decl., Ex. 2; Kay Decl. ¶ 3).
Plaintiff seeks an order compelling GM’s compliance with
the Court’s October 10, 2023 Discovery Order and the imposition of sanctions on
the grounds that GM’s supplemental responses remain deficient and
non-code-compliant.  
Legal Standard
A code-compliant response to a request for production consists of
any of the following: (1) a statement that the party will comply, (2) a
representation that the party lacks the ability to comply, or (3) an
objection.  (CCP §§ 2031.210.)  A statement that the party will
comply must state that the Request for Production (“RPD”) “will be allowed
either in whole or in part, and that all documents or things in the demanded
category that are in the possession, custody, or control of that party and to
which no objection is being made will be included in the production.” 
(CCP § 2031.220.)  “If only part of an item or category of item in a
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is objectionable, the
response shall contain a statement of compliance, or a representation of
inability to comply with respect to the remainder of that item or
category.”  (CCP § 2031.240(a).)  If an objection is made the
responding party must “[i]dentify with particularity any document, tangible
thing, land, or electronically stored information falling within any category
of item in the demand to which an objection is being made.”  (CCP §
2031.240(b)(1).) 
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.320(a),
“[i]f a party filing a response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing,
or sampling under Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280
thereafter fails to permit the inspection, copying, testing, or sampling in
accordance with that party's statement of compliance, the demanding party may
move for an order compelling compliance.”¿ (CCP § 2031.320(a).)
Discussion 
 
The
Court determines that GM’s December 8, 2023 supplemental responses are code
compliant.  For example, RPD No. 17 requests: 
All DOCUMENTS,
including ESI and emails, concerning any internal analysis or investigation by
YOU or on YOUR behalf regarding TRANSMISSION DEFECT(S) in CHEVROLET VEHICLES
equipped with the same 8-speed transmission like the SUBJECT VEHICLE. [This
request shall be interpreted to include any such investigation and analysis to
determine the root cause of such TRANSMISSION DEFECT(S), any such investigation
to implementing a countermeasure or permanent repair procedure for such
TRANSMISSION DEFECT(S), any such investigation into the failure rates of parts
associated with such TRANSMISSION DEFECT(S), any cost analysis for implementing
a proposed repair procedure, any savings analysis for not implementing proposed
repair procedures, etc. [This Request requires Defendant to produce all
associated DOCUMENTS, where applicable, by the Custodian’s name, job title, and
job description.]
(RFP NO. 17.) 
The supplemental response
pursuant to the Court’s October 10, 2023 order provides that: 
“Subject
to the terms and conditions of the Court’s Order and the executed Protective
Order, and pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 2030.230, GM
has complied in part and produced all documents in its possession, custody, or
control responsive to this request and refers Plaintiff to the following
produced documents: Recalls/Bulletins applicable to the same year/make/model
vehicle as the SUBJECT VEHICLE: RUIZ JORGE000000081 – RUIZ JORGE000000082 and
RUIZ JORGE000000126 – RUIZ JORGE000000142; Lists of Technical Service Bulletins
(“TSBs”) and Information Service Bulletins (“ISBs”) applicable to the same
year/make/model vehicle as the SUBJECT VEHICLE: RUIZ JORGE000000113 – RUIZ
JORGE000000121; Specific TSBs: RUIZ JORGE000017538 – RUIZ JORGE000017596;
Recalls Not Already Produced: RUIZ JORGE000017597 – RUIZ JORGE000017612; EWO:
RUIZ JORGE000017478; TWO: RUIZ JORGE000017479 - RUIZ JORGE000017515; PRTS: RUIZ
JORGE000017516 – RUIZ JORGE000017518; DFMEA: RUIZ JORGE000017519 – RUIZ
JORGE000017523; RUIZ JORGE000017524 – RUIZ JORGE000017537; 16-NA-019: RUIZ
JORGE000017613 – RUIZ JORGE000017641; 16-NA-361: RUIZ JORGE000017642 – RUIZ
JORGE0000000017674; 18-NA-355: RUIZ JORGE000017675 – RUIZ JORGE000019579; 16-
NA-364: RUIZ JORGE000019580 – RUIZ JORGE000019581; 16-NA-404: RUIZ
JORGE000019582 – RUIZ JORGE000019618; and 17098: RUIZ JORGE000019619 – RUIZ
JORGE000019621.”
(Supp. Response to RFP No. 17.) 
The supplemental responses
indicate that Defendant is complying “in whole” or “in part” by producing all
documents “within its possession, custody, or control”.   The supplemental responses comply with the
requirement that a party state: “all documents or things in the demanded
category that are in the possession, custody, or control of that party and to
which no objection is being made will be included in the production.” (CCP §
2031.220.)  Thus, the responses are code
compliant and Plaintiff’s contentions to the contrary are meritless.
Accordingly, the motion to compel compliance with the
Court’s October 10, 2023 order is DENIED.
