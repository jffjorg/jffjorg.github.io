Defendants to give notice. 
 
The complaint was filed on April 10, 2023, by Plaintiffs
Robert W. Harrold and Maureen M. Harrold against Defendants Enzo Enterprises,
Smooth Sailing Consultants GP, and Darius Rutledge alleging (1) Fraud/Deceit;
(2) Financial Elder Abuse; (3) Quiet Title; (4) Cancellation of Instruments;
(5) Declaratory Relief; (6) Slander of Title; and (7) Unjust Enrichment. 
On April 11, 2023, Plaintiffs filed an Ex Parte Application
requesting a Temporary Restraining Order and OSC re Preliminary Injunction.  On April 12, 2023, the Court granted the
Temporary Restraining Order.  On May 10,
2023, the Court granted the Motion for Preliminary Injunction.  
On August 15, 2023, the Court entered Default against all
named defendants.  Default judgment was
entered on January 11, 2024.   
Defendants Smooth Sailing Consultants GP and Darius
Rutledge ("Defendants") request orders to 1) set aside default
judgment under CCP § 473(b) and 2) quash service of the Summons on the ground
that service was not made according to any statutorily authorized methods for
service of Summons.
Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a
party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or
other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application
for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading
proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted,
and shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months,
after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.” (CCP § 473(b).)

Here, default judgment was entered on January 11,
2024.  Defendants filed the instant
motion to set aside default judgment on April 11, 2024, well within the six-month
period allowed for motions under CCP § 473(b). 
Defendants argue they were never properly served with service of Summons
and they deny they have submitted to the personal jurisdiction of the Court. (Rutledge
Decl., ¶ 1; Orloff Decl., ¶ 4.) The policy of hearing cases on their merits is
well-established. (See, e.g., Berman v. Klassman (1971) 17 Cal.App.3d
900.) Given the liberality associated with Motions to Set Aside Defaults, the
Court finds the Rutledge and Orloff Declarations are sufficient to warrant
relief.  The law favors trials on the
merits. (Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980.) 
Accordingly, Defendants Smooth Sailing Consultants GP and
Darius Rutledge’s motion to set aside default judgment is GRANTED.
 
Motion to Quash Service of Summons
Having set aside the default and default judgment, the
Court considers Defendants’ Motion to Quash Service of Summons.  Defendants move for an order quashing service
of Summons on the ground that service of Summons was not made according to any
statutorily authorized methods of service. 

Plaintiffs argue that Defendants submitted to the
jurisdiction of the Court by filing briefs and making general appearances to
oppose Plaintiffs’ motions for a temporary restraining order and preliminary
injunction.  Defendants, through their attorneys,
filed briefs and attended hearings on the OSC re: Preliminary Injunction on
April 26, 2023 and May 10, 2023. (Fok Decl., ¶ 14-15, 17-19.) After Defendants’
appearance on April 26, 2023, Plaintiffs believed Defendants had made a general
appearance, so they served a courtesy copy of the Summons, Complaint, and TRO
Application upon attorney Andrew Bodkin. (Fok Decl., ¶ 16; Proofs of Service
filed May 3, 2023.)    
Pursuant C.C.P. § 410.50(a), a general appearance is
equivalent to the personal service of the summons and complaint on such party.
An appearance is general if the party contests the merits of the case or raises
other than jurisdictional objections. (Fireman's Fund Ins. Co. v. Sparks
Construction, Inc. (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1135, 1145.) Where a party on
whom summons is required to be served, voluntarily appears, and makes a
defense, service of summons is “waived”. (In re Strong's Estate (1942)
54 Cal.App.2d 604, 610-11.)  Therefore,
when a party, in person or by attorney, enters into the action such as the
filing of a pleading in the case or by other recognition of the authority of
the court to proceed in the action, process is “waived.” (Id.)
Defendants argue that an appearance to oppose a request for
a temporary restraining order is not a general appearance, so the Court never
obtained personal jurisdiction over Defendants. “An appearance at a hearing at
which ex parte relief is sought, or an appearance at a hearing for which an ex
parte application for a provisional remedy is made, is not a general appearance
and does not constitute a waiver of the right to make a motion under Section
418.10.” (CCP § 418.11.)  Defendants
point out that their brief in opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for a
Preliminary Injunction indicated they were making a special appearance.  
Plaintiffs counter that Defendants made a general
appearance on May 10, 2023 by opposing the Motion for a Preliminary Injunction
on the merits. (Factor Health Management v. Superior Court (2005) 132
Cal.App.4th 246.  “An order to
show cause for a preliminary injunction is not within the scope of section
418.11, which extends only to ex parte applications for provisional relief.
This is because a motion for a preliminary injunction “involve[s] a
determination related to the merits of the case.” (Id. at 251.) Here, Defendants
opposed Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction on jurisdictional grounds
and on the merits. (Defendants’ Opposition Brief to Plaintiff's Motion for a Preliminary
Injunction filed April 20, 2023.) By opposing Plaintiffs’ motion on the merits,
Defendants made a general appearance at the May 10, 2023 hearing and thereby
submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the Court.  
Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to Quash Service of Summons
is DENIED.  Defendants’ Proposed Answer
is not deemed filed as of today’s date. 
Defendants are ordered to separately file and serve the Proposed Answer
within 5 court days.
