And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"This tentative ruling denies Plaintiff Zhoie Perez's motion to compel responses to requests for production of documents. Plaintiff, representing herself pro per, alleges that she served a request for production of documents on the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department, but the department refused to release the requested documents. Defendant argues that Plaintiff has presented no evidence that the Sheriff's Department adopted a position of non-disclosure and that Plaintiff cannot compel the production of documents through a motion that was not served upon the entity from which the documents are sought. The court finds that Plaintiff has brought the motion against the wrong entity, and accordingly, the motion is denied. Additionally, Plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $720.00 is also denied."
