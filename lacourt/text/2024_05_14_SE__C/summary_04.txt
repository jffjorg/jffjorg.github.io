Summary:

This is a tentative ruling issued by the judge in the case of Robert W. Harrold and Maureen M. Harrold against Enzo Enterprises, Smooth Sailing Consultants GP, and Darius Rutledge. The defendants have moved to set aside the default judgment entered on January 11, 2024, and to quash service of summons. The court grants the motion to set aside the default judgment, finding that the defendants were not properly served with the summons and that the court's policy favors trials on the merits. The court denies the motion to quash service of summons, finding that the defendants made a general appearance by opposing the motion for a preliminary injunction on the merits. The court orders the defendants to file and serve a proposed answer within five court days.
