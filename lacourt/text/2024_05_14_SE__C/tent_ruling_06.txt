Tentative Ruling 
Plaintiff Scarlet Morales’s Motion for Summary
Judgment is DENIED. 
Opposing Party to give notice. 
 
Plaintiff Scarlet Morales moves for summary judgment on the
grounds that there are no triable issues of material fact in dispute and
Plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. 
Background
This is an unlawful detainer action. On August 1, 2023,
Plaintiff Scarlet Martha Morales (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Defendant Armida Cardenas (“Defendant”) seeking six months of unpaid rent from
February 1, 2023 to August 1, 2023, totaling $15,000, in addition to holdover
damages of $83.33 per day starting July 31, 2023.  Plaintiff is Defendant’s former
mother-in-law.  
Legal Standard 
The purpose of a motion for summary judgment “is to provide
courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to
determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to
resolve their dispute.”  (Aguilar v. Atl.
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) 
“Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires the
trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all
inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other
inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material
fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of
law.”  (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) 
“On a motion for summary judgment, the initial burden is
always on the moving party to make a prima facie showing that there are no
triable issues of material fact.”  (Scalf
v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.)  A defendant moving for summary judgment “has
met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if the
party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot
be established.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §
437c(p)(2).)  “Once the defendant . . .
has met that burden, the burden shifts to the plaintiff . . . to show that a
triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action or
a defense thereto.”  (Id.)  “If the plaintiff cannot do so, summary
judgment should be granted.”  (Avivi v.
Centro Medico Urgente Med. Ctr. (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.) 
“When deciding whether to grant summary judgment, the court
must consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers (except evidence to
which the court has sustained an objection), as well as all reasonable
inferences that may be drawn from that evidence, in the light most favorable to
the party opposing summary judgment.” 
(Avivi, supra, 159 Cal.App.4th at p. 467; see also Code Civ. Proc., §
437c, subd. (c).)
Discussion 
Under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1170.7, a
motion for summary judgment in an unlawful detainer action may be made at any
time after the answer is filed upon giving five days’ notice. The motion is
granted or denied on the same basis as a motion under section 437c, however,
the provisions of section 437c concerning the time for making and hearing the
motion and requirement of a separate statement in support or opposition do not
apply. Cal. Civ. Proc. Code §437c(b), (r). Code of Civil Procedure section
1161(2) states, in pertinent part, that a tenant is guilty of an unlawful
detainer when (1) the tenant continues in possession without the permission of
the landlord, or the successor in estate of the landlord, if appliable, (2)
after default in the payment of rent, pursuant to the lease or agreement
regarding rental of the property, and (3) after the expiration of the three
days’ written notice stating the amount due by the tenant without either
payment or notice provided by the tenant in response to such written notice. 
Plaintiff states that Defendant lives at the Subject
Property under a verbal month-to-month agreement with Plaintiff, whereby
Defendant is to pay $2,500 to Plaintiff per month, due on the 1st of each
month. (Morales Decl. ¶¶ 9, 10, 14; Ruben Decl. ¶ 5, 7, 10.)
Plaintiff states that Between 2020 and October 2022,
Defendant fell significantly behind in rent, and the back rent owed reached
$17,000. (Morales Decl. ¶ 13; Ruben Decl. ¶ 13.) For the next few months,
including December 2022 and January 2023, Defendant paid the monthly rent.
(Morales Decl. ¶15; Ruben Decl. ¶ 15, Exhibit E.) Defendant then failed to pay
the monthly rent that came due on February 1, 2023 through June 1, 2023,
without any justification for the non-payment. (Morales Decl. ¶¶ 16-17, 24-25;
Ruben Decl. ¶ 16.)
Plaintiff states that on June 22, 2023, as a result of
Defendant’s failure to pay the rent, Plaintiff served Defendant with a
three-day notice to pay rent or quit (“Notice”) demanding $12,500 in past due
rent, in accordance with California Civil Code section 1161(2). (Morales Decl.
¶ 18, Exhibit F; Hornbuckle Decl. ¶¶ 6-8.) The Notice asked Plaintiff to resume
paying rent or vacate. (Morales Decl. ¶ 18, Exhibit F.) Plaintiff states she properly
served Defendant the Notice at the Subject Property. (Hornbuckle Decl. ¶ 8,
Exhibit G.) Plaintiff alleges Defendant did not pay any portion of the amount
outstanding. 
Plaintiff produces evidence that dating back to late 2005,
Plaintiff’s now deceased partner, Ezequiel Edward Campos, held title to the
Subject Property. (Morales Decl., ¶¶ 3, 4, Exhibit A.) Plaintiff produced
evidence that, in May 2021, Mr. Campos, by way of a grant deed dated May 7, 2021
and recorded on January 4, 2022, transferred ownership interest to himself and
Plaintiff as Joint Tenants. (Morales Decl. ¶ 5, Exhibit B.) On November 3,
2022, Mr. Campos passed away, and on December 5, 2022, Plaintiff recorded an
Affidavit of Death of Joint Tenant regarding the Subject Property. (Morales
Decl., ¶¶ 6-7, Exhibit C, Exhibit D.) As the result of Mr. Campos’ passing,
Plaintiff became the sole owner of the Subject Property.
Plaintiff has produced evidence that she owns the Subject
Property, she entered into a rental agreement with Defendant, Defendant
defaulted on the agreement, and Defendant continues in possession of the
Subject Property without Plaintiff’s permission and without paying the
outstanding balance.  Plaintiff has also
produced evidence that she properly served a three-day written notice to pay
rent or quit.  The burden now shifts to
the Defendant to raise a triable issue of material fact.  
In Opposition to the motion, Defendant Armida Cardinas
submits declarations by herself and her children, Arianna Aguirre and Rueben D.
Cardenas.  Collectively, all three
individuals deny that the three-day notice was posted on the Subject Property
on June 23, 2023, or at any other time. 
They also deny that the three-day notice was mailed to them on June 23,
2023, or at any other time. (Armida Cardenas Decl., ¶¶ 2-6; Arianna Aguirre Decl.,
¶¶ 2-6; Rueben D. Cardenas Decl., ¶¶ 2-6.) 
The Court determines that the declarations create a triable issue of
material fact as to whether the three-day notice was properly served in
compliance with CCP § 1161(2).  
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment is
DENIED.     
Evidentiary Objections
Defendant’s evidentiary objection No. 1 to the Declaration
of Scarlet Martha Morales is overruled. 
Defendant’s evidentiary objection No. 1 to the Declaration
of James Hornbuckle is overruled.
