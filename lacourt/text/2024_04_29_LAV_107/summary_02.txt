And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is about a motion to compel arbitration in a lawsuit between plaintiff Ira Mandel and defendant Vegas Auto Gallery Lotus Cars Las Vegas. The plaintiff purchased a used vehicle from the defendant, but the odometer was "rolled back" to show lower mileage. The plaintiff demanded that the defendant rescind the purchase agreement, but the defendant refused. The defendant then filed a motion to compel arbitration, which the plaintiff opposed. The court must determine whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate disputes, and if so, whether the arbitration agreement is enforceable. The court finds that the purchase agreement and arbitration agreement are integrated and that the arbitration agreement is enforceable. The court also orders a stay of proceedings pending the outcome of the arbitration.
