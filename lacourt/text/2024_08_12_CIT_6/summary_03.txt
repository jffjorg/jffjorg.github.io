And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted defendant Tae Jung's motion to quash service of summons. The plaintiff's service of the summons and complaint on the defendant is hereby quashed. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of this order. The court finds that the defendant's motion is well taken, as she has presented evidence showing that she and her husband sold the property where substitute service was effect and that they left the United States on November 6, 2023, and intend to remain abroad indefinitely. The plaintiff did not oppose the motion, and therefore failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that service was properly effect as to the defendant.
