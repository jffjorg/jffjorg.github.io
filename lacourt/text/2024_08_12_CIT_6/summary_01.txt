And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to quash service of summons. The plaintiff's service of the summons and complaint on the defendant is hereby quashed. The defendant is ordered to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of this order. The court finds that the defendant has presented evidence showing that they and their husband sold the property where substitute service was effected and left the country on November 6, 2023. The court concludes that the address where substitute service was effected was not the defendant's dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address, and therefore the plaintiff has failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that service was properly effected as to the defendant.
