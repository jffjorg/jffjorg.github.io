STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This
is a breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets action involving
multiple consolidated and related actions and cross-actions. 
 
Defendants Dr. Robert C. Blaine,
Blaine Laboratories, Inc., and Blaine Holding & Development, LLC move for
summary judgment or summary adjudication of Solutech Pharmaceuticals, LLC’s claims.
 
 
//          
TENTATIVE RULING:
            
Defendants Dr. Robert C. Blaine,
Blaine Laboratories, Inc., and Blaine Holding & Development, LLC move for
summary judgment or summary adjudication of Solutech Pharmaceuticals, LLC’s
claims.  
 
            Defendant’s
Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Fact sets out 29 individual
undisputed material facts without distinction as to each cause of action which
is challenged by the motion. California Rule of Court 3.1350(d)(1) states that
the Separate Statement must “separately identify (A) each cause of
action . . . that is the subject of the motion” and “(B): each supporting
material fact claimed to be without dispute with respect to the cause of
action.” (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1350(d)(1).) In addition, the issues set
forth in the Notice of Motion are not set forth verbatim in the Separate
Statement, as required by Rule 3.1350(b). Failure to comply with the Rules of
Court with respect to a Motion for Summary Judgment or Summary Adjudication is
grounds for denial of the motion. (See Truong v. Glasser (2009) 181
Cal.App.4th 102, 118.) 
 
            Defendant’s
Separate Statement is not compliant with the Rules of Court. Plaintiff Solutech
objects to the Separate Statement on this basis, and, even if it had not, numerous
appellate opinions urge trial courts to liberally exercise their authority to
deny motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication that do not comply
with the separate statement requirements. (E.g., Beltran v. Hard Rock Hotel
Licensing, Inc. (2023) 97 Cal.App.5th 865, 877.) The separate statement
“serves two functions: to give the opponent notice of the facts; and to permit
the trial court to focus on the facts germane to the issues.” (North Coast
Business Park v. Nielsen Construction Co. (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 22, 31.) While
the Court might be inclined to overlook deficiencies in the form of the Separate
Statement if its contents were sufficiently clear to fulfill those functions,
that is not the case here. Defendant’s papers suggest, by the distribution of
citations to the Separate Statement, that not all facts identified in the
Separate Statement are material to each cause of action challenged by the
motion. (See Memo of Ps & As pp 10:18-24; 12:7-13:6.) Because the Separate
Statement does not distinguish between claims, however, it is not possible to
conclusively determine which facts are germane to each claim. These
deficiencies are therefore fatal to the motion.
 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.
 
            Defendant’s
Motion for Summary Adjudication is DENIED. 
 
            Moving Parties
to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
