```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The defendant's separate statement does not comply with the rules of court, specifically California Rule of Court 3.1350(d)(1), which requires that the statement separately identify each cause of action and the material facts supporting each cause of action. The court finds that the defendant's separate statement does not provide sufficient notice of the facts and does not distinguish between claims, making it impossible to conclusively determine which facts are germane to each claim. As a result, the court has denied the defendant's motion.
