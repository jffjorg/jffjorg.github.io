And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a hearing scheduled for May 16, 2024, on Defendant's motion for summary judgment. The Plaintiff and Defendant have both filed "Highly Confidential Exhibits" without complying with California Rules of Court, rules 2.550 and 2.551. The Judge has ruled that any party seeking to seal court records must strictly comply with these rules. The parties have three options: file a motion to seal, file in the public record, or not file at all. The Judge will hear from the parties regarding which option they will pursue. As the Judge cannot consider the merits of the motion until this issue is resolved, the hearing is continued.
