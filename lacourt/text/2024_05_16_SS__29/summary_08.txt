And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge has granted the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The case was originally dismissed because the Plaintiff failed to appear at trial, but the Plaintiff claims that this was due to a mistake by their counsel, Kenneth C. Yeager. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has established that the dismissal was due to counsel's mistake, inadvertence, surprise or neglect, and therefore grants the motion. The case is reinstated, and the Judge sets a new trial setting conference and an order to show cause for failure to file proof of service of summons and complaint.
