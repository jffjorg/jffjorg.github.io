Davis (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 50 asserting one cause of action for motor vehicle negligence arising out of an accident on December 28, 2018, near the intersection of Ventura Boulevard and Sepulveda Boulevard in Sherman Oaks. Defendant filed her answer on March 14, 2022.On April 16, 2024, Johnny Rundell of Hershey Law, P.C. (“Counsel”) filed this motion to be relieved as counsel. No opposition has been filed.Legal StandardThe court may order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)    An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e)).    Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).)  Discussion Counsel has filed the Notice, Declaration and Order to be Relieved as Counsel.  Electronic service requires a declaration stating the electronic service address is the client’s current address. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The Declaration of Kelsi D. Grau provides that on April 10, 2024, counsel reached out to Plaintiff via email to confirm the email was current; Plaintiff responded the same day stating he preferred electronic service and that the email listed on the proof of service was the correct email address. Counsel contends there has been a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship as Plaintiff fails to sign addendum to retainer agreement or verifications for discovery responses. (Decl., No. 2.) The Court finds Counsel has established good cause to be relieved due to the breakdown of the attorney-client relationship.  All substantive and procedural requirements are satisfied. The Court notes, however, that after the moving papers were filed, Defendant filed a motion that is now set for hearing on June 20, 2024.  The proposed order submitted by Counsel was correct when submitted but now must be updated. Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED, subject to updating of the proposed order.ConclusionThe motion to be relieved as counsel is GRANTED.The Judicial Assistant is directed to update the proposed order (MC-053) submitted on 4/16/24 as follows:·         Item 7a.  The next scheduled hearing in this action is set for: 6/20/24 at 1:30 pm in Dept. 29 of the Spring Street Courthouse. ·         Item 7b.  The hearing will concern: Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions and monetary sanctions for Plaintiff’s violation of a court order. ·         Item 8.  The following additional hearings are set in this action: Final Status Conference on 9/30/34, at 10:00 am in Dept. 29 of the Spring Street CourthouseThe order is effective upon the filing with the Court of a proof of service showing service of the signed order on the client.Moving counsel to give notice.
