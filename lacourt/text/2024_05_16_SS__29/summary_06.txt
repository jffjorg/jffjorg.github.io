And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the defendant's motions to compel the plaintiff to respond to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The plaintiff has failed to respond to these discovery requests, which were served on October 18, 2023. The defendant also seeks sanctions, but the judge denies these requests. The court orders the plaintiff to serve written, verified, code-complaint responses to the discovery requests within 21 days of notice. The court also denies the defendant's requests for sanctions.
