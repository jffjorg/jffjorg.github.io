 Case Number:  22STCV26465    Hearing Date:   May 16, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is set for hearing on
May 16, 2024.
Plaintiff, in connection with her opposition, filed on May 2 a
“Notice of Lodging of Highly Confidential Exhibits ….”  Plaintiff then inaccurately states that a
prior order of this court granted the parties permission to file documents
under seal without complying with California Rules of Court, rules 2.550 and
2.551.  (The prior order did not do so.)
Defendant, in connection with its opposition, filed on May 10
a “Notice of Loding of Highly Confidential Exhibits …”  
Any party seeking to seeking an order to seal court records
must strictly comply with California Rules of Court, rules 2.550 and 2.551.  That’s what the Rules of Court say, and that’s
what paragraph 18 of the Protective Order says.
As to the documents described as the “Highly Confidential
Exhibits,” that means that the parties have essentially three options: (1) file
a motion or application for an order to seal court records under rules 2.550
and 2.551; (2) file the documents in the public record; or (3) not file the
documents at all (or withdraw any references to the documents), in which case
they will not be considered by the Court in connection with the pending summary
judgment motion.
The Court will hear from the parties regarding which option
they will pursue.  As the Court cannot
consider the merits of the motion until this issue is resolved, the hearing is
continued.
