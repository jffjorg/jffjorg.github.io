The court has reviewed the parties' submissions and is considering the timeliness of Loya's motion and the potential prejudice to Plaintiffs from any delay. Loya seeks to intervene in the case to assert the same defenses as Defendant, who is unable to be contacted. Plaintiffs oppose the motion, arguing that Loya unreasonably delayed in seeking to intervene. The court will hear from Loya's counsel regarding the reasons for the delay and will consider the totality of the circumstances, including the stage of the proceedings and potential prejudice to the other parties.
