 Case Number:  21STCV12014    Hearing Date:   May 16, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion for Leave
to Intervene filed by Prospective Intervenor, Loya Casualty Insurance Company
Tentative
The Court will
hear from counsel.
Background
On March 29, 2021, Plaintiffs Olivia Marie Robles, Maria Luisa
Robles, and Maria Theresa Robles (“Plaintiffs”) filed a complaint against
Defendant Lavina Rashanda Ireland (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 50,
asserting causes of action for negligence, negligence per se, and statutory
liability arising out of a vehicle accident on April 16, 2019, at or near the
intersection of Puente Avenue and Merced Avenue in Industry.  
Defendant filed an answer to the complaint on
August 31, 2022.
On April 4, 2024, Proposed Intervenor Loya
Casualty Insurance Company (“Loya”) filed this motion for leave to intervene and
file an Answer-in-Intervention.  Plaintiffs
filed an opposition on May 2, 2024. No reply has been filed.
Legal Standard
“An intervention takes place when a¿nonparty,
deemed an intervenor, becomes¿a party to an action or proceeding between other
persons” and joins a plaintiff in seeking relief, unites with a defendant in
resisting the claims of a plaintiff, or demands relief adverse to both a
plaintiff and a defendant.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 387, subd. (b).)
Subdivision (d) of Code of Civil Procedure
section 387 provides as follows:
(1) “The court
shall, upon timely application, permit a nonparty to intervene in the action or
proceeding if either of the following conditions is satisfied: 
(A) A provision of
law confers an unconditional right to intervene. 
(B) The person
seeking intervention claims an interest relating to the property or transaction
that is the subject of the action and that person is so situated that the
disposition of the action may impair or impede that person’s ability to protect
that interest, unless the person’s interest is adequately represented by one or
more of the existing parties.
(2) The court may,
upon timely application, permit a nonparty to intervene in the action or
proceeding if the person has an interest in the matter in litigation, or in the
success of either of the parties, or an interest against both.”
“It is well settled that the intervener's interest
in the matter in litigation must be direct, not consequential, and that it must
be an interest which is proper to be determined in the action in which
intervention is sought.”¿(Simpson Redwood Co. v. State of California¿(1987)¿196
Cal.App.3d 1192, 1199-1200.)  To
establish a direct and immediate interest in the litigation for purposes of
permissive intervention, a non-party seeking intervention must show that he or
she stands to gain or lose by direct operation of the judgment, even if no
specific interest in the property or transaction at issue exists.¿ (Id.
at p. 1201.)  It is sufficient that there
is “a substantial probability” that the proposed intervenor’s interests will be
affected by the judgment.  (Timberidge¿Enterprises,
Inc. v. City of Santa Rosa¿(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 873, 881-882.)
“Whether the intervener’s
interest is sufficiently direct must be decided on the facts of each case.”  (Simpson Redwood Co., supra, 196
Cal.App.3d at p. 1200.)  “[S]ection 387
should be liberally construed in favor of intervention.”¿ (Ibid.)¿ 
Discussion
Loya seeks leave for permissive intervention
in this matter, arguing that it has a direct interest in the proceeding under
Insurance Code section 11580, subdivision (b)(2), as Defendant’s liability
insurer.  (Motion, at p. 6; Amano Decl.,
¶¶ 3, 7-8.)  Loya has been providing the
defense for Defendant, but Defendant’s counsel has been unable to contact Defendant
for months (if not longer).  (Amano
Decl., ¶¶ 2-7.)  Counsel has retained a
private investigator in an attempt to locate Defendant and has “exhausted all
avenues of making contact with the Defendant” but has been unsuccessful to
date.  (Id., ¶¶ 5-7.)
Courts in California regularly
allow insurance carriers to intervene when the carrier is liable (or
potentially liable) for a judgment under Insurance Code section 11580 but the insured
is unable to defend or otherwise fails to refuses to defend.  (See, e.g., Western Heritage Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court¿(2011)¿199 Cal.App.4th 1196, 1205; Royal Indemnity Co. v.
United Enterprises, Inc.¿(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 194, 206; Reliance Ins.
Co. v. Superior Court¿(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th¿383, 386; Jade K. v.¿Viguri¿(1989)
210 Cal.App.3d 1459, 1468; see also 1 Weil & Brown, California Practice
Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (2023), ¶¶ 2:433-435.)¿
Loya has followed all
proper procedures and has shown that it has a direct interest in the outcome of
the litigation.  Allowing intervention
will not enlarge the proceedings; all that Loya will do is to assert the same
defenses that are available to Defendant.
Plaintiffs contends,
however, that Loya has unreasonably delayed in seeking to intervene.  A party seeking to intervene, whether as of right
or permissively, must act in a timely manner. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 387, subds. (d)(1) & (d)(2).)  In considering the timeliness of a request to
intervene, courts must consider the totality of the circumstances, including the
stage of the proceedings, prejudice to the other parties from any delay, and
the reason for such delay.  (Crestwood
Behavioral Health v. Lacy (2021) 70 Cal.App.5th 560, 574; 1 Weil &
Brown, supra, ¶ 2:438.)
Here, Plaintiffs point out that they
propounded discovery on Defendant in March 2023 and filed motions to compel
(after Defendant failed to respond to the discovery) in May 2023.  (Garcia Decl., ¶¶ 5-7.)  Loya did not move to intervene until April
2024, approximately a year after the discovery responses were due – which is presumably
the time that Defendant’s counsel first realized (or should have realized) that
they could not communicate with Defendant. 
Trial in this matter was initially set for September 2022 and has
already been continued twice, with a current trial date of August 14,
2024.  Granting the motion to intervene
could, at least potentially, lead to a request for a third continuance of the
trial date.
Loya has not provided any explanation for its
delay.  The Court recognizes, of course,
that some reasonable period of time is necessary to determine that a client is
not communicating with counsel, and that intervention by the carrier may be closer
to a last resort than a first resort. 
Nonetheless, Loya does not explain what (if anything) it did during the
seven-month period between April 2023 (when the discovery responses were due)
and November 2023 (when it retained a private investigator to locate Defendant).  Nor does Loya explain why it delayed almost
five more months (from November 2023 to April 2024) between the time it
received the report from the investigator to the time it filed its motion to
intervene.
The Court will hear from Loya’s counsel regarding
this delay, the reasons for the delay, and whether, if the motion is granted,
Loya has adequate time to prepare for trial as scheduled.
The Court will hear from Plaintiffs’ counsel
on the issue of what prejudice (if any) it has suffered from the delay or will
suffer if the motion is granted after Loya’s delay.
Conclusion
The Court will hear from counsel.
