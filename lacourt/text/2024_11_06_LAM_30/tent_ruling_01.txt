JF Capital Advisors, LLC
vs. 1541 Thompson Holdings LLC, et. al., Case No. 23STCP03686
Tentative Ruling
re:  Petitioner’s Motion to Compel
Further Discovery Responses
 
Petitioner requests an order
compelling 1541 Thompson Holdings LLC (Respondent) to provide further responses
to JF Capital Advisors, LLC’s (Petitioner) Request for Production of Documents,
Set One, requests 1–5, 9, 13, 14, 18–27, 33, 34, 37, and 38. The motion is granted,
and Respondent is ordered to produce documents and code compliant verified
responses within ten (10) days of today’s date. 

Petitioner also requests monetary
sanctions against Respondent in the amount of $1,773 pursuant to sections
2023.010 and 2031.300, subdivision (c).  Respondent
is ordered to pay sanctions in the amount of $1,773 to Petitioner’s counsel
within thirty (30) days of today’s date.
 
A party may move for an order
compelling further response to a request for production of documents if the
demanding party deems that responses are incomplete, evasive, or contain
meritless objections. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a).)  A motion to compel further responses to an
inspection demand “shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying
the discovery sought by the inspection demand.” (Id., § 2031.310, subd.
(b)(1).) “Good cause” may be found to justify discovery where specific facts
show that the discovery is necessary for effective trial preparation or to
prevent surprise at trial. (Associated Brewers Dist. Co. v. Superior Court
(1967) 65 Cal.2d 583, 586–588.)
“For discovery purposes, information is
relevant if it ‘might reasonably assist a party in evaluating the case,
preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement.’
[Citation]. Admissibility is not the test and information, unless
privileged, is discoverable if it might reasonably lead to admissible evidence.
[Citation] These rules are applied liberally in favor of discovery.” (Gonzales
v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546.) 
Request for Production of
Documents, Set One, requests 1–5, 9, 13, 14, 18–27, 33, 34, 37, and 38.
            Respondent’s responses to Petitioner’s discovery request were
due 30 days after the production request was served on June 6, 2024. (Bosko
Decl. ¶ 2, Ex. 1.) On July 9, 2024, Respondent provided only objections to
Petitioner’s request for production. (Id., ¶ 3, Ex 2.) This response was
both late and deficient. Accordingly, the Court grants Petitioner’s request to
compel further responses on the grounds that Respondent filed a late and
incomplete response to Petitioner’s discovery request. Petitioner has
demonstrated good cause exists for its requests because the documents are
relevant to Respondent’s financial solvency and ability to pay an arbitration
award. Respondent does not argue any objections in its opposition.
 
            Respondent argues that the current motion is unnecessary
because Respondent offered to supplement its responses. Respondent has produced
no evidence attesting to this. Petitioner alleges that no responses have been
provided. Accordingly, Petitioner’s motion is granted.
 


 
Monetary Sanctions
“[T]he
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust. If a party then fails to obey the order
compelling a response, the court may make those orders that are just, including
the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in
addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300,
subd. (c).)
 
Here, Petitioner
calculates that “the total reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees incurred for
the three concurrently served motions is at least $5,320, or $1,773.33 per
motion.” (Bosko Decl., ¶ 11.) Accordingly, the Court awards Petitioner $1,773.33
in connection with this motion.
