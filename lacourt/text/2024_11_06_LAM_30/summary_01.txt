And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the petitioner's motion to compel further discovery responses from the respondent. The respondent failed to provide complete responses to the petitioner's request for production of documents, and the petitioner has shown good cause for the discovery sought. The respondent's responses were late and deficient, and the petitioner has demonstrated that the discovery is necessary for effective trial preparation or to prevent surprise at trial.

The judge also orders the respondent to pay monetary sanctions to the petitioner in the amount of $1,773.33, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.300. The petitioner calculates that it incurred reasonable costs and attorneys' fees of at least $1,773.33 in connection with the motion.

The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and California Rules of Court, specifically sections 2031.310 and 2031.300. The judge notes that the respondent's failure to provide complete responses to the discovery request was both late and deficient, and that the petitioner has shown good cause for the discovery sought.
