And here is the English summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The tentative ruling grants the motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The case is reinstated, and a new trial date is set for September 13, 2024. The judge finds that the dismissal was due to the mistake of counsel, who was informed by the courtroom clerk that the trial would be continued to mid-July 2024, but failed to appear for trial on July 1, 2024. The judge grants mandatory relief under Code of Civil Procedure ยง473(b), which allows for relief from a dismissal caused by attorney neglect. The judge notes that the dismissal was not due to any of the exceptions listed in the statute, such as dismissals for failure to prosecute or failure to serve a complaint. The judge finds that the plaintiffs promptly sought relief and did not demonstrate any unfair prejudice that would result from setting aside the dismissal.
