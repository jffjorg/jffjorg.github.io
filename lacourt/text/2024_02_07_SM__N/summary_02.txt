And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendants' motion to reopen discovery and take a subsequent deposition of the plaintiff, Avital Hasid. The defendants argued that the deposition was necessary to update information on Hasid's condition and damages, particularly in light of her traumatic brain injury and the fact that she has designated dozens of non-retained medical experts. The judge found, however, that the defendants had not demonstrated sufficient diligence in seeking the updated deposition, as the motion was brought more than a year after discovery had closed. The judge also expressed concerns that permitting the discovery would interfere with the trial calendar, as the case is set to expire in June 2024. The judge noted that the defendants had not sought this relief earlier, despite having multiple opportunities to do so, and that the plaintiff had already been deposed three times.
