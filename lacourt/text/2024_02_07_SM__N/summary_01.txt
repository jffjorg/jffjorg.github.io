Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the demurrer filed by Defendants Daniel Borenstein and German Quality Builders, LLC to the Complaint filed by Plaintiffs. The Court has found that the demurrer is OVERRULED as to the third and fourth causes of action, but SUSTAINED with Leave to Amend as to the second cause of action for Negligence Per Se.

The Court has determined that the doctrine of Negligence Per Se is an evidentiary doctrine, rather than an independent cause of action, and that it cannot be pleaded as a separate cause of action. The Court has also found that the allegations of trespass are sufficient to state a cause of action, even if the fire was negligently caused rather than intentionally set.

The Court has also considered the allegations of private nuisance and has found that the interference with Plaintiffs' use and enjoyment of their property constitutes a private nuisance. However, the Court has also found that the nuisance claim is a negligence claim if the facts relied upon are the same as those in the negligence claim.

The Court has ordered the parties to meet and confer in an effort to resolve the dispute, and has set a hearing date for February 7, 2024.
