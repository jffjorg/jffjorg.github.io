  - "The Court finds that Dr. Rassen's analysis appears to be correct, as the 2-7-23 test shows all normal levels other than a low, not critically low or critical, protein level of 61."
```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for trial preference. The plaintiff, Ronny Graham, argues that he is unlikely to survive another six months due to his medical history, but did not provide clear and convincing medical documentation to support this claim. The judge notes that the plaintiff's expert witness, Dr. Attarchi, did not submit any medical records or other documentation of the medical history he reviewed, and that the defendant's expert witness, Dr. Rassen, disputes Dr. Attarchi's findings. The judge finds that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence to persuade the court that there is substantial medical doubt that he will not live longer than six months.
