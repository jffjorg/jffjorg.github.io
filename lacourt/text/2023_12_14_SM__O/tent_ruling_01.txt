TENTATIVE
RULING
            Plaintiff Ronny Graham’s Motion for Trial Preference is
DENIED. Plaintiff did not provide clear and convincing medical documentation showing
Plaintiff Ronny Graham suffers from an illness or condition raising substantial
medical doubt of survival beyond six months under CCP § 36(d).        
 
            CCP §36 subdivision (d) states: “[i]n its discretion, the
court may also grant a motion for preference that is accompanied by clear and
convincing medical documentation that concludes that one of the parties suffers
from an illness or condition raising substantial medical doubt of survival of
that party beyond six months, and that satisfies the court that the interests
of justice will be served by granting the preference.”  See, Fox v. Superior Court (2018) 21
Cal.App.5th 529, 534 [“The heightened clear and convincing proof standard is
required for motions seeking discretionary grants of preference under [CCP 36] subdivision
(d), but not for motions seeking mandatory preference under subdivision [CCP
36] (a).”].) 
 
            Plaintiff Ronny Graham (“Graham”) is sixty-seven (“67”)
years old, thus CCP § 36(d) applies. “The standard of proof known as clear and
convincing evidence demands a degree of certainty greater than that involved
with the preponderance standard, but less than what is required by the standard
of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. This intermediate standard requires a
finding of high probability.” (Conservatorship of O.B. (2020) 9 Cal.5th
989, 998, citations omitted; see CACI No. 201 [“Certain facts must be proved by
clear and convincing evidence .... This means the party must persuade you that
it is highly probable that the fact is true”].) “Clear and convincing evidence
requires a finding of high probability . . . requiring that the evidence be so
clear as to leave no substantial doubt; sufficiently strong to command the
unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.” (In re Angelia P. (1981)
28 Cal.3d 908, 919.)
 
            Graham argues, pursuant to the Declaration of Shahab
Attarchi (“Dr. Attarchi”), a “hospitalist with over 20 years of experience,” that
he is unlikely to survive another six (6) months due to Graham’s “medical
history of hypertension, cerebral vascular accident with residual left sided
weakness, aphasis, dysphagia, sepsis, liver disease and elevated enzymes, gout,
high cholesterol, contractures, benign prostatic hyperplasia, severe muscle
atrophy and muscle weakness.” (Motion, p. 1; Attarchi Decl., ¶¶ 6, 8, 9.) Dr.
Attarchi declares he recently examined Graham on October 3, 2023 and reviewed
Graham’s medical history which led Dr. Attarchi to the conclusion that Graham
“is in significant ill health and that there exists a substantial medical doubt
that Ronny Graham has more than six months to live.” (Attarchi Decl., ¶¶ 6, 7,
8.)  Grahm did not submit any medical
records or other documentation of the “medical history” Dr. Attarchi reviewed. 
 
            The Samson Defendants provide a declaration from Dr.
Joshua Rassen, MD (“Dr. Rassen”) and attached Graham’s medical records utilized
by Dr. Rassen in support of his conclusion that “there is no rationale in the
medical records as to why Graham's longevity is expected to be less than 6
months,” and “Graham appears to be in stable health with chronic changes due to
his stroke.” (Rassen Dec., ¶¶ 29, 30.) Dr. Rassen disputes Dr. Attarchi’s
finding that Graham’s 2-7-23 protein levels were low by stating “the medical
records show that on February 7, 2023, the protein level was normal; his
albumin level was 3.5, within the normal range of 3.5 to 5.7.” (Rassen Decl., ¶
15, Ex. D, GrahamWPACH-05985.) Further, Dr Attarchi declares that Graham’s
overall protein level was 6.4 on 2-7-23, when in fact the 2-7-23 test shows a
total protein level of 6.1. (See Ex. D, GrahamWPACH-05985.) The 6.1 figure is listed
in red and placed in the “out of range” category, however Dr. Attarchi appears
to compare this total protein level with Graham’s recommended albumin levels,
thus conflating two separate reference ranges. (Attarchi Decl., ¶ 9, p. 3:3–5;
Rassen Decl., ¶ 15.) The Court notes that Neither Dr. Attarchi nor Dr. Rassen
adequately describe what a low 6.1 protein level means in relation to the
reference range of 6.4–8.9 as listed in Graham’s 2-7-23 test. (See Ex. D,
GrahamWPACH-05985.) However, the 6.1 figure is preceded by the letter L in red
ink, which according to the medical record indicates a “low” figure, not
critically low or CL, not critical or AA, and not abnormal or A, all of which
appear to indicate worse diagnoses than an L listing. 
 
            Dr. Rassen argues that “[w]hile it is correct that Mr.
Graham had abnormal liver tests one year ago, back in November and December
2022, [Ex. D, Graham-WPACH-05971; 05983] when the repeat liver function testing
was completed in February 2023, the liver function was found to be entirely
normal, which Dr. Attarchi did not mention in his declaration. [Ex. D,
GrahamWPACH-05985]. Extensive tests for infection and other causes of liver
disease were normal. [Ex. D, Graham-WPACH-05971; 05980].” The Court finds that
Dr. Rassen’s analysis appears to be correct, as the 2-7-23 test shows all
normal levels other than a low, not critically low or critical, protein level
of 61. The 2-7-23 test, which Dr Attarchi does not reference other than to
conflate figures to argue his position, appears to show Graham’s health has
considerably improved from the previous testing which took place in November
and December of 2022. Thus, the Court finds that Graham, and his expert Dr.
Attarchi, have not provided clear and convincing evidence to persuade the Court
that there is substantial medical doubt Graham will not live longer than six
months. 
 

            Thus, Graham’s Motion for Trial Preference is
DENIED
