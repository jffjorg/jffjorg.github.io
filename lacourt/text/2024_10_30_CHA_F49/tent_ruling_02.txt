ANALYSIS
 
The
court may order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before
or after judgment or final determination upon request by either client or
attorney and after notice from one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc. § 284, subd. (2).)
“The determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel
lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,
1133.) An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council
Forms MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053
(Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).)
 
            In addition, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362,
subsection (d) requires that the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and
proposed order be served on the client and all other parties who have appeared
in the case by personal service, electronic service, or mail. If the notice is
served by mail, it must be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing
that either:
 
            (A) The service address is the current residence or
business address of the client; or
(B)
The service address is the last known residence or business address of the
client and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after
making reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the
motion to be relieved.
 
            (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(1)(A) & (2).)
 
Here, Counsel has filed Judicial Council Forms MC-051 and
MC-052. Counsel has also lodged Judicial Council Form MC-053 with the Court. 
 
 
Counsel
has provided a declaration stating that the Motion is necessitated by “a
breakdown in communication” and that “the attorney-client relationship is
irreparably broken.” (MC-025, ¶ 2.) The Court finds Counsel’s reasons for
seeking relief to be satisfactory. 
 
Counsel states
in the declaration that the Motion was served by mail, return receipt
requested, at Calvin Alexander Kim’s last known address, for which Counsel was
unable to confirm as the current address. (MC-052, ¶ 3b(2)(a).) Counsel has
filed Proof of Service, demonstrating that proper service was made served on the
client and all other parties who have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(d).)
 
Counsel indicates on the MC-052 and MC-053 forms that the
next hearing scheduled for this action is a hearing on Motion to Compel
Discovery for Responses to Special Interrogatories set for December 11, 2024, in
this department. (MC-052, ¶ 5.) A jury trial is not yet set. (Id. ¶ 6.) 
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel. 
 
CONCLUSION
 
Counsel Chi Leung Ip and Law
Offices of Edward C. Ip & Associates’ Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel for Defendant/Cross-Complainant Calvin
Alexander Kim is GRANTED.
 
Moving counsel to give notice.
