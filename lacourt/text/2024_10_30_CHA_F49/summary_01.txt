And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling concerns a motion to amend a dismissal of a lawsuit from "without prejudice" to "with prejudice." The plaintiff, Ely Obverto Perla, had previously dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice, but now seeks to dismiss it with prejudice. The court finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect in the original dismissal and grants the motion in part, vacating and setting aside the voluntary dismissal without prejudice. The plaintiff may now file a proper voluntary dismissal with prejudice.
