the following causes of action: (1) Motor Vehicle Liability, and (2) General

            On June

ANALYSIS
 
“A
plaintiff may dismiss his or her complaint, or any cause of action asserted in
it, in its entirety, or as to any defendant or defendants, with or without
prejudice prior to the actual commencement of trial.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 581,
subd. (c).)
 
Numerous cases note
that voluntary dismissal of a lawsuit terminates the trial court's jurisdiction
over the matter. (Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Humboldt Loaders, Inc.
(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 921, 931; Associated Convalescent
Enterprises v. Carl Marks & Co., Inc. (1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 116,
120.) (But see, Basinger v. Rogers & Wells
(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 16, 21–22 [which notes the breadth of this statement must
be limited so as to except the trial court's retention of jurisdiction to
vacate the dismissal upon motion of a party pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 473].)
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b) provides, in part, “The court
may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party or his or her legal
representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken
against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b).) Plaintiff or
Cross-Complainant has standing to move to vacate and set aside their voluntary
dismissal. (See W.Bradley Electric, Inc. v. Mitchell Engineering (2024)
100 Cal.App.5th 1.)
 
A.   
Motion to
Amend Dismissal
 
Plaintiff moves to dismiss the Complaint and the entire
action of all parties and all causes of action with prejudice. Plaintiff
also acknowledges that he has previously requested a voluntarily dismissal
without prejudice.
 
Plaintiff’s counsel, Bobby Waltman (“Waltman”), attests
that “[t]he parties resolved this matter and it was Plaintiff’s intention to
dismiss this entire action with prejudice but, due to my error in completing
the request for dismissal, I accidentally filed the request for dismissal
without prejudice.” (Waltman Decl. ¶ 2.)
 
Moreover, Waltman states, “I called Mr. Mark Lobre, defense
counsel, after he alerted me to my mistake in dismissing this action without
prejudice, and I let him know that I would file a motion to amend the request
for dismissal to be ‘with prejudice,’ which he was in support of and agreed
to.” (Waltman Decl. ¶ 3.)
 
The Court notes that the case file reflects two Request for
Dismissal were filed on the same day, May 16, 2024; one requesting dismissal
with prejudice and the other without prejudice. The Court clerk first entered
the request for dismissal without prejudice. Consequently, the request for
dismissal with prejudice was not entered, as the action had already been
dismissed without prejudice based on the earlier entry. 
 
Based on the above records and declarations, the Court
finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated the existence of mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 
 
Therefore, the Court GRANTS IN PART the Motion, vacating
and setting aside the voluntary dismissal without prejudice, entered on May 16,
2024, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b).
 
Plaintiff may now file a proper voluntary dismissal with
prejudice in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure section 581, subdivision
(c).
 
CONCLUSION
 
Plaintiff Ely Obverto Perla’s
Motion to Amend Dismissal is GRANTED IN PART, consistent with the above ruling.
 
Moving party to provide notice.
