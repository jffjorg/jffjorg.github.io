And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, Cody and Natalie Hardcastle, and against defendant John Gonzales. The ruling is based on a stipulation for entry of judgment (SEJ) that was signed by the parties on October 27, 2021. The SEJ required Gonzales to make 60 consecutive monthly payments of $1,295.30 starting on December 1, 2021, and ending on November 1, 2026. However, Gonzales failed to make payments starting from February 1, 2024, despite receiving notices of default and having 10 days to cure defaults. As a result, the court has granted the plaintiffs' motion for a judgment in the amount of $42,796.82, which includes the outstanding balance of $38,906.20 plus 10% interest on the default amount. The court took Gonzales' failure to oppose the motion as a concession on the merits.
