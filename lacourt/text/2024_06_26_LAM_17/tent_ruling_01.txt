 Case
  No.:  19STCV40314   
 
 
 
 Hearing Date: June 26, 2024



 
Plaintiff’s motion for a judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and
against Gonzales based on the terms of the Stipulation for Entry of Judgment
between the parties is GRANTED.
 
           On 11/8/2019, Plaintiffs Cody and
Natalie Hardcastle (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed suit against Side Bar at Oh
Crab, A-1 Expedite, Inc., M&B Holdings, Inc., John Gonzalez, and Michele
Gonzales, alleging: (1) breach of written and oral contract; (2) breach of
written contract; (3) breach of oral contract; (4) fraudulent concealment; (5)
negligent misrepresentation; (6) appointment of a receiver; (7) money had and
received; (8) money lent; and (9) preliminary injunction. 
 
           On 5/22/2024, Plaintiffs moved for a
judgment in favor of them and against Defendant John Gonzales (Gonzales), based
on the terms of a Stipulation for Entry of Judgment between the parties. 
 
           The motion is unopposed. 
 
Discussion

 
           On 10/27/2021, Plaintiffs and
Gonzales settled this matter by way of a Stipulation to Enter (SEJ). 
 
           The SEJ required Gonzales to make
sixty (60) consecutive monthly payments of $ 1,295.30 beginning on December 1,
2021, and continuing on the first of each month until November 1, 2026, when a
total of $ 77,718 was paid. (Id., ¶ 3.) Hardcastle would provide a
Notice of Default and allow Gonzales ten (10) days to cure any missed payment.
(Id.) A failure to cure a default entitles Hardcastle to a judgment
against Gonzales in the sum of $ 77,718 less any payments already made. (Id.)
 
Repeated Notices of Default have been sent to Gonzales via
his attorney. (Id, ¶ 4.) Through February 1, 2024, Gonzales typically
cured the default. However, since then, Gonzales has failed to remit the
monthly payment despite a Notice of Default being provided March 1, 2024 (for
the February 1, 2024, payment) and April 1, 2024 (for the March payment). (Ibid.)
More than ten days have passed with Gonzales failing to cure the default. 
 
Gonzales has paid a total of $38,811.80 to Hardcastle. (Id.,
¶ 9.) A balance of $38.906.20 is due and outstanding ($77,718 - $ 38,811.90).
Per the SEJ, Hardcastle is also entitled to 10% on any default amount.
Therefore, the total judgment amount should be $42,796.82.
 
After review of the SEJ and Plaintiffs’ documentation
showing default, the Court finds that the relief sought should be granted. (See
Motion, Exh. A; Stafford Decl.) The Court takes Gonzales’ failure to oppose
as a concession on the merits. 
 
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for a judgment in
favor of Plaintiffs and against Gonzales based on the terms of the Stipulation for
Entry of Judgment between the parties is granted. 
 
It is so
ordered.
