And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Plaintiff Joy Slagel's motion to compel further responses to her special interrogatories and requests for production. The court finds that the defendant has failed to provide sufficient responses to the interrogatories, which seek information relevant to establishing the defendant's reasons for termination and whether those reasons are pretextual. The court also finds that the defendant has failed to provide sufficient responses to the requests for production, which seek information relevant to determining whether the defendant's proffered reason for termination is reasonable.

The court sanctions the defendant and its counsel $1,050 for failing to comply with the discovery requests. The court orders the defendant to provide further responses to the special interrogatories and requests for production within a certain timeframe.

The court also notes that discovery remains open in this case and that the parties may continue to conduct discovery until trial. The court's ruling is tentative, meaning that it may be changed or modified at the hearing on June 26, 2024, if the parties submit on the tentative ruling.
