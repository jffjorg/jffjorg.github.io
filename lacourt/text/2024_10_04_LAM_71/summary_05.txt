```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has ruled that the defendants' demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint is sustained without leave to amend. The demurrer is based on the settlement agreement between the parties, which released and waived all claims arising from the project and subcontract. The Judge has also denied the defendants' motion to strike as moot.

In summary, the Judge has determined that the plaintiff's causes of action are barred by the settlement agreement, and therefore, the plaintiff's complaint is insufficient to state a cause of action.
