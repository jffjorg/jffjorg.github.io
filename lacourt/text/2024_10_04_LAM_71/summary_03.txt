**Significant Statements**

* "The required elements for fraudulent concealment are: (1) concealment or suppression of a material fact; (2) by a defendant with a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff; (3) the defendant intended to defraud the plaintiff by intentionally concealing or suppressing the fact; (4) the plaintiff was unaware of the fact and would not have acted as he or she did if he or she had known of the concealed or suppressed fact; and (5) plaintiff sustained damage as a result of the concealment or suppression of the fact."
* "Plaintiff failed to plead with sufficient particularity the defect Ford allegedly concealed."
* "Plaintiff's fraud claim is based on an alleged fraudulent omission rather than affirmative misrepresentation, seeks purely economic losses, and derives from Ford's alleged breach of warranty."
* "The economic loss rule bars Plaintiffs' fraud claim."
