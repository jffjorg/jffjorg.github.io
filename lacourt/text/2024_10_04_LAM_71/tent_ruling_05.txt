Meet and Confer
Before filing a demurrer, the
moving party must meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video
conference with the party who filed the pleading to attempt to reach an
agreement that would resolve the objections to the pleading and obviate the
need for filing the demurrer.  (C.C.P.
§430.41, emphasis added.) 
Defendants’ counsel declares that
on June 13, 2024, he met and conferred telephonically with Plaintiff’s counsel,
and the parties were unable to reach an agreement.  (See Decl. of Steinbach ¶¶3-4.)  Defendants’ counsel’s declaration is
sufficient under C.C.P. §430.41. 
Accordingly, the Court will consider Defendants’ demurrer.
 
          Background
          Plaintiff
filed its operative Complaint on March 3, 2024, against Defendants  alleging sixteen causes of action: (1) fraudulent
inducement of contract (concealment of material fact); (2) recission of
contract (mutual mistake); (3) recission of contract (unilateral mistake); (4) recission
of contract (violation of public policy); (5) breach of written contract; (6) work,
labor, and services performed/agreed price; (7) reasonable value of goods and
services provided (quantum meruit); (8) open book account; (9) account states;
(10) fraudulent inducement of subsequent documents (intentional fraud); (11)
fraudulent inducement of subsequent documents (negligent fraud); (12)
fraudulent inducement of subsequent documents (concealment of material fact);
(13) recission of subsequent documents (duress); (14) recission of subsequent
documents (mutual mistake); (15) recission of subsequent documents (unilateral
mistake); and (16) recission of subsequent documents (violation of public
policy).  
          Defendants
filed the instant demurrer and accompanying motion to strike on July 24,
2024.  Plaintiff filed its untimely opposition
on September 23, 2024.  Defendants filed their
reply on September 30, 2024.
          Defendants
object to Plaintiff’s opposition on the basis it was untimely filed.  Plaintiff’s opposition was due September 20,
2024, to account for observance of Native American Day, a Court holiday on
September 27, 2024.  (See C.C.P.
§1005(b).)  Therefore, Plaintiff’s
opposition is untimely.  However, the
Court in its discretion will consider Plaintiff’s opposition.
 
Summary of
Demurrer
Defendants demur
to all causes of action on the basis Plaintiff released/waived the cause of
action pursuant to a written settlement agreement and therefore Plaintiff fails
to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.  (Demurrer, pgs. 2-7; C.C.P. §430.10(e).)  Defendants demur to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 7th,
10th, 11th, 12th, 14th, 15th, and 16th causes of action on the basis they are
barred by the applicable statute of limitations.  (Demurrer, pgs. 2-7; C.C.P. §430.10(e).)  Defendants demur to the 1st, 10th, 11th, and
12th causes of action on the basis they fail to meet the heightened pleading
requirements to plead fraud causes of action. 
(Demurrer, pg. 2; C.C.P. §430.10(e).) 
Defendants demur to the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th causes of action on
the basis they are barred by the doctrine of res judicata because the same
allegations were made in Plaintiff’s prior complaint, which was dismissed with
prejudice.  (Demurrer, pgs. 2-5; C.C.P.
§430.10(e).)  
 
Legal Standard
“[A] demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a
complaint.” (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385,
388.)  A demurrer can be used only to
challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack or from
matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable.  (See Donabedian v. Mercury Insurance Co. (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994 [in ruling on a demurrer, a court may not consider
declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice, or documents not accepted
for the truth of their contents].)  For
purposes of ruling on a demurrer, all facts pleaded in a complaint are assumed
to be true, but the reviewing court does not assume the truth of conclusions of
law.  (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital
District (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
Waiver/Release of
Claim
In December 2021,
Plaintiff and Defendants entered into a settlement agreement by which
Defendants paid Plaintiff $2,500,000 to resolve all claims arising from a February
25, 2021, Complaint and action.  (Complaint,
Exh. 4 at ¶1.1; D-RJN, Exh. A.)  STS and
EWC negotiated and executed the Settlement Agreement with the below broad
release language, and a separate Civil Code §1542 waiver (¶3.2), releasing all
claims—including future and unknown claims—“arising out of or connected with”
the Project, the Subcontract, and the 2021 litigation:
[Plaintiff] hereby release[s] and discharge[s]
[Defendants] . . . each of them . . . from any and all claims, lawsuits,
demands, debts, liabilities, remedies, damages, accounts, obligations, costs,
expenses (including attorneys’ fees), liens, actions, and causes of action of
every kind and nature, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected,
that it now owns or holds or at any time heretofore has owned or held, based
on, related to or arising from any transaction, contract, tort, lien,
liability, matter, cause, cause of action, fact, thing, conduct, act, or
omission whatsoever, which [Plaintiff] may now have or may hereafter have
arising out of or connected with the PROJECT, the Subcontract and the LAWSUIT.
. .. 
 
(Complaint, Exh.
4 at ¶ 3.1, emphasis added.) 
Further, the
parties agreed the Settlement Agreement’s release was entered into with both
parties having legal representation and advice of counsel (Complaint, Exh. 4 at
¶4.3); there had been no duress (Complaint, Exh. 4 at ¶4.17); and that the
parties executed the release with the understanding they may learn of different
or additional facts (Complaint, Exh. 4 at ¶4.2).
The parties then
entered into change orders which contained similar waiver and release language,
and act as accord and satisfaction barring Plaintiff’s claims. (Complaint, Exhs.
6-7.)  
In Salehi v. Surfside
III Condominium Owners Association, the Court of Appeal held that a
settlement barred the plaintiff’s causes of action in a subsequent litigation
related to the same dispute because plaintiff and defendant executed a
settlement agreement releasing known and unknown claims, and plaintiff assumed
the risk of unknown claims by waiving Civil Code §1542.  (Salehi v. Surfside III Condominium Owners
Assn. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1146, 1160.)
Here, like in Salehi,
all of Plaintiff’s causes of action were released and waived by the Settlement
Agreement because they arise from the Project and the Subcontract, were
released in the 2021 litigation, and Plaintiff assumed the risk of unknown
claims by waiving Civil Code §1542.  (See,
e.g., Complaint ¶¶19, 31, 36, 44, 48, 64, 67, 71, 74, 82, 90, 97, 102, 109,
119, 129; Kaufman v. Goldman (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 734, 745 [upholding
settlement agreement and stating, “[i]t is important to recognize there is a
strong public policy favoring settling of disputes”].)
Accordingly,
Defendants’ demurrer to all of Plaintiff’s causes of action is sustained without
leave to amend.
 
          Conclusion
Defendants’
demurrer to Plaintiff’s 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th,
11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th causes of action is sustained without
leave to amend.
Moving Party to
give notice.
 
2.    
Motion to Strike
In light of this
Court’s ruling on the demurrer, Defendants’ motion to strike is denied as moot.
