[1]As set forth above, Smith’s notice of motion states
that he moves to set aside the default entered against “ATW Trust.” The notice
of motion does not mention “Arroliga.” Moreover, default was entered against “Milder
Arroliga, as trustee of the ATW Trust, With An Effective Date of January 1,
2012” on November 4, 2021. 


[2]As discussed, Smith moves “to set aside the default
entered against ATW Trust on November 4, 2021,” not Walkowiak. (Notice of
Motion at pp. 1:26-2:1.)  


[3]The Court notes that Smith discusses a number of
arguments for the first time in the reply. The Court notes that “¿[p]oints raised for the first time in a reply
brief will ordinarily not be considered, because such consideration would
deprive the respondent of an opportunity to counter the argument.¿” (American Drug Stores, Inc. v. Stroh (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1446, 1453¿.) Thus, the
Court declines to consider new arguments raised in the reply.
