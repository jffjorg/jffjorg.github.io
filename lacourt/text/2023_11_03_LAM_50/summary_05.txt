And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling by the judge addresses a motion by Smith to set aside a default entered against the ATW Trust on November 4, 2021. The default was entered against Milder Arroliga, as trustee of the ATW Trust, not Walkowiak, as mentioned in Smith's notice of motion. The judge declines to consider new arguments raised in Smith's reply brief, citing case law that states that points raised for the first time in a reply brief are not typically considered.
