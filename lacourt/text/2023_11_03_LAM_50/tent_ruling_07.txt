[1]The Court notes
that on December 21, 2022, Defendants filed an answer to the SAC. The third
affirmative defense of Defendants’ answer alleges that “[t]he SAC, and each
cause of action therein, is barred by the statute of limitations, including,
without limitation, Code of Civil Procedure §§ 337,
338, 339, 340, 343, and 430.10.” Answer to SAC, ¶ 3.)


[2]Plaintiff asserts
that “[i]n order to adjudicate this defense, the parties will put forth witness
testimony and documentary evidence regarding: (1) the Non-Circumvention
Agreement between the parties; (2) the Side Letter setting forth the intentions
of the partnership or JV; (3) Defendants’ secret deal to cut Wave out of the
Breakout investment opportunity; (4) Defendants’ misrepresentations regarding the
secret deal to cut Wave out of the Breakout investment opportunity; (5)
Defendants subsequently cutting Wave out of the opportunity to invest in
further opportunities as part of the partnership or JV; (6) when Wave suffered
harm as a result of the foregoing misconduct and when it knew or should have
known that its claims had accrued; and (7) whether any equitable tolling
applies due to Defendants’ continued misconduct and misrepresentations to
Wave.” (Opp’n at p. 10:7-15.) 


[3]The Court notes
that Defendants’ Answer to the SAC contains affirmative defenses for “unclean
hands,” “estoppel,” and “unjust enrichment.” (Answer, ¶¶ 2, 5, 26.)
