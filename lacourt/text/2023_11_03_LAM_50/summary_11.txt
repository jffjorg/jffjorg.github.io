And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by RQ Media Group, Inc. and Brian Salzman to the multiple causes of action in the original complaint filed by Caroline Ruddy. The defendants demurred to the first six causes of action, but no opposition was filed. However, the plaintiff subsequently filed a First Amended Complaint, making the demurrer to the original complaint moot. The court notes that the demurrer is therefore no longer relevant and will not be considered.
