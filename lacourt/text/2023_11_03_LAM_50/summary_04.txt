And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

Judge Treu's Tentative Ruling denies Morgan Smith's motion to set aside the default entered against ATW Trust on November 4, 2021. The motion is procedurally defective because Smith does not argue that the default contains a clerical mistake, and the Court does not see how Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d) is applicable. Smith argues that the default was entered due to extrinsic mistake, but Plaintiff's counsel states that Arroliga executed a declaration swearing that he was a trustee of ATW Trust, and Smith's counsel did not address this assertion in the reply. Additionally, the Court previously issued an Order severing the action against Milder Arroliga, John Walkowiak, and The Ancient Temple of Wings, leaving only Vidala Aaronoff, et al. remaining. Smith's motion is denied, and Plaintiff is ordered to give notice of this Order.
