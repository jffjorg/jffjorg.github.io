TENTATIVE RULING
  RE:
 
DEFENDANTS RQ
  MEDIA GROUP, INC. AND BRIAN SALZMAN’S DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT
 




On May 19, 2023, Plaintiff Caroline Ruddy
(“Plaintiff”) filed the instant action against Defendants RQ Media Group, Inc.
and Brian Salzman (jointly, “Defendants”). The Complaint alleges causes of
action for (1) breach of contract, (2) promissory estoppel, (3) fraudulent
inducement, (4) breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (5)
intentional misrepresentation, (6) negligent misrepresentation, (7) retaliation
in violation of Labor Code section 1102.5, (8) retaliation in violation of Labor Code section 98.6, and
(9) wrongful termination in violation of public policy. 
            Defendants demur to the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and
sixth causes of action of the Complaint. No opposition to the demurrer was
filed. However, the Court notes that on September 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed a
First Amended Complaint. Accordingly, Defendants’ demurrer to the
Complaint is moot.
