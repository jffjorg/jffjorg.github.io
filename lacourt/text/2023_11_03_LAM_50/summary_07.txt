And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the case and is considering the defendant's affirmative defenses, including the statute of limitations defense. The plaintiff asserts that the defendant's actions, including cutting them out of an investment opportunity and making misrepresentations, caused harm and that the claims accrued at a certain point in time. The court notes that the parties will need to present witness testimony and documentary evidence to adjudicate the defense, including evidence related to the non-circumvention agreement, side letter, and alleged secret deal. The court is considering the defendant's affirmative defenses of unclean hands, estoppel, and unjust enrichment, and will need to review further evidence to determine the merits of these defenses.
