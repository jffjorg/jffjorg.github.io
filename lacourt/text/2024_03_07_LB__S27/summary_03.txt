Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion to strike the Plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages and related allegations from the complaint. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff has failed to plead sufficient facts to support the request for punitive damages. The Court notes that the Plaintiff's allegations of a previous failure of the power line and SCE's alleged knowledge of the safety issue are insufficient to support a conclusion that the failure to repair was willful. The Judge orders the Plaintiff to amend his complaint within 20 days, stating specific facts concerning prior failures and repairs of the line that would lead to the conclusion that the failure to repair was willful. If the Plaintiff does not file an amended complaint, the Defendant must file an answer to the complaint within 30 days.
