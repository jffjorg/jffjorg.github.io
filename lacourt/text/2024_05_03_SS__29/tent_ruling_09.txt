 Case Number:  23STCV17336    Hearing Date:   May 3, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendants’ Motions to Compel Plaintiff Jonathan Velasco to
Respond to Form Interrogatories and Demand for Production of Documents
 
Tentative
The motions are granted.
Background
On July 24, 2023, Jonathan Velasco (“Plaintiff”)
and Daniela Castro filed a complaint against Parastoo Davood and Romain
Hiniszlos (collectively “Defendants”) for negligence arising from an automobile
accident occurring on June 1, 2022.
On November 16, 2023,
Defendants served written discovery on Plaintiff. (Lee Decls., ¶2.)
On February 13, 2024,
Defendants filed motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to Form
Interrogatories and Demand for Production of Documents. No opposition has been
filed.
Legal
Standard
A party must respond to interrogatories within
30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party
to whom interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit
for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are
required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide
a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (a).)
When a party moves to compel initial responses
to interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A party must respond to requests for production
of documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007)
148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules
of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to
provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).)
When a party moves to compel initial responses
to requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).) Requests for admission may be propounded on a party without leave of
court 10 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by that party,
whichever occurs first. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.020(b).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has
engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary
sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020,
subd. (a).)
Discussion
On November 16, 2023,
Defendants served written discovery on Plaintiff. (Lee Decls., ¶2.)
Plaintiff has not
responded. (Id., ¶ 3.)
 
Defendants need show
nothing more. The motions to compel are GRANTED,
Defendants’ requests for sanctions are
DENIED.  On motions to compel initial responses to interrogatories
and requests for production, the Civil Discovery Act authorizes sanctions
against a party or attorney “who unsuccessfully makes or opposes” the motion.  (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290(c) & 2031.300(c).) But here, no opposition has been
filed.
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030,
subdivision (a), does not provide an independent basis to award sanctions; the
sanctions award must be “authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method or any other provision of this title.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030.)  As Justice Moor explained in City of Los
Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504,
section 2023.030 does “not independently authorize the trial court to impose
monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.”  (The Court is aware
that the California Supreme Court has granted review of the City of Los Angeles
case.  The order granting review, filed on January 25, 2023, states
that pending review, the appellate opinion “may be cited,” including “for its
persuasive value.”  The Court finds the reasoning of Justice Moor to
be persuasive.)
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS the
motions to compel.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff
to serve code-compliant, verified, written responses, without objection, to
Defendants’ Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Requests for Production (Set
One) within 30 days of notice.
 The Court DENIES the
requests for sanctions.
 Moving party is
ORDERED to give notice.
