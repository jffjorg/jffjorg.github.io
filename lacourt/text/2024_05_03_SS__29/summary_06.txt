The court has reviewed the petitions for approval of compromise filed by Max Torres-Lopez and Christina Villareal, and has identified several issues that need to be addressed before the petitions can be approved. These issues include the lack of attachment for Item 11b(6), the failure to specify the terms and conditions of the annuity in Attachment 18b(3), and the inconsistency in Item 18b(2). The court has continued the hearings to allow the petitioners to address these outstanding issues. Counsel may appear by phone or video conference, and the personal appearance of the claimant and guardian ad litem is excused.
