```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

**Summary**

The court grants the defendants' motions to compel the plaintiff's responses to interrogatories and requests for production, and orders the plaintiff to serve code-compliant, verified, written responses within 30 days of notice. The court also denies the defendants' requests for sanctions. The plaintiff failed to respond to the defendants' written discovery requests, and no opposition was filed to the motions to compel. The court finds that the defendant's motions are granted as a result of the plaintiff's failure to respond to discovery.
