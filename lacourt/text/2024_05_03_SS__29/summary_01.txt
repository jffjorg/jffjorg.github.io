And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling is a decision on a motion to compel the deposition of plaintiff Eddie Baker. The motion is granted, and the court orders the plaintiff to appear for his deposition and produce the requested documents. The court also grants the defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $705. The ruling is based on the court's finding that the plaintiff failed to appear for a properly noticed deposition, did not object, and did not oppose the motion. The court finds that the plaintiff's conduct was not substantially justified and that the imposition of sanctions would not be unjust.
