And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the City of Los Angeles' motion to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in its requests for admission in part. The motion is granted because the plaintiff, Michael Thomas, failed to respond to the requests for admission in a timely manner and did not serve a verification of his responses. The Court finds that the plaintiff's failure to respond is a misuse of the discovery process and that the City is entitled to relief. The Court orders that the truth of the matters specified in the requests for admission, except for those objected to, is deemed admitted as between the plaintiff and the City. The Court also denies the City's request for sanctions.
