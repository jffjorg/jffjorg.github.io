 Case Number:  21STCV39973    Hearing Date:   May 3, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s Counsel Sam Ryan Heidari. 
Tentative
The Court will call this matter.
Background
On October 29, 2021, Oscar Rolando Marroquin
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Ana Alvarado Hernandez (“Defendant”)
for negligence cause of action arising out of an automobile accident occurring
on October 29, 2019. Defendant has yet to file a responsive pleading in this
matter.
On April 5, 2024, Sam
Ryan Heidari of Heidari Law Group, P.C. (“Counsel”) filed this motion to
be relieved as counsel. No opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
Counsel has
filed and served the Notice, Declaration and Order to be Relieved as Counsel. 
 
With one exception,
counsel has satisfied the substantive and procedural requirements for the
motion to be relieved.  
 
The one exception
is that the Declaration (Form MC-052) is not signed.  The Court will call the matter and request
that counsel affirm, under penalty of perjury, the statements in the
Declaration.
 
Conclusion
If the motion is
granted, the order will be effective upon filing with the Court of a proof of
service showing service of the signed order (not the minute order) on the
client.
Moving counsel
to give notice.
