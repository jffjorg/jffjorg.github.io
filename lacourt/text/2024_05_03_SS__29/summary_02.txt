And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Defendant, Mina George Baskharon, has filed a motion for terminating sanctions against the Plaintiff, Naser Baharloo, for his failure to comply with the court's orders regarding discovery. The court has denied the Defendant's request for terminating sanctions, but has granted the request for a further monetary sanction in the amount of $817.65. The court has also ordered the Plaintiff and his attorney, Steven Slavitt, Esq., to pay the monetary sanction. The court's decision is based on the fact that the Plaintiff has failed to provide discovery responses and has violated court orders, but the Defendant has not shown a history or pattern of willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been or cannot be cured by lesser sanctions. The court's decision is intended to obtain compliance with the Civil Discovery Act and the court's orders, and to prevent a "windfall" for the Defendant.
