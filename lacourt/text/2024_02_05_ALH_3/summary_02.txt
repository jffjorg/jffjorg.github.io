The court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel responses to special interrogatories. The plaintiff, Renyong Dong, failed to respond to the defendant's special interrogatories despite being given multiple opportunities to do so. The court has granted the defendant's motion and ordered the plaintiff to serve verified responses without objections within 10 days. The court has also imposed a monetary sanction of $485 against the plaintiff and their counsel for failing to respond to the discovery requests. The court finds that the plaintiff did not act with substantial justification and that the sanction is not unjust. The plaintiff and their counsel are ordered to pay the monetary sanction within 10 days.
