And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has considered the motion to lift stay pending perfection of the appeal. The Plaintiff, Kevin Gamez, seeks to lift the stay resulting from the Defendant's appeal of the Arbitration Order. The Defendant, Glenn E. Thomas Company, Inc., opposes the motion. The Court has determined that Senate Bill 365 grants trial courts discretion in implementing a stay, but without clear legislative intent, the Court cannot retroactively apply the current enactment of CCP section 1294(a). Therefore, the Court denies the motion to lift the stay pending perfection of the appeal.
