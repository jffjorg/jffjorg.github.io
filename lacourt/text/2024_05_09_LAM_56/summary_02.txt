Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling denies the Motion of defendants Dvir Cohen and Yafit Cohen for an order dissolving or modifying the November 8, 2022 preliminary injunction. The court finds that the defendants have not shown a material change in the facts or a change in the law that would support dissolving or modifying the injunction. The defendants have not presented evidence that the plaintiff failed to post the required cash or corporate surety bond of $50,000.00, and they have not shown how not receiving rental payments from the plaintiff is affecting them financially. The court finds that the issuance of the injunction was based on the same facts regarding the effect on the defendants' possession, transfer, and sale of the Lemon Property presented again by the defendants.
