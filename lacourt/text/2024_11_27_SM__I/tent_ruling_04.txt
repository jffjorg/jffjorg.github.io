 Case Number:  24SMCV01802    Hearing Date:   November 27, 2024    Dept:  I The motion is DENIED as MOOT.  The gist of the motion is that plaintiff’s
counsel cannot represent plaintiff nor can it file papers because the firm has
not filed a recent Statement of Information and is therefore suspended by
operation of law.  The court does not
know why plaintiff's counsel did not oppose the motion or defendant did not withdraw it.  In any event, the problem was cured on
October 23, 2024 (after the motion was filed). 
Because this is a curable problem and it has been cured, the motion is
DENIED AS MOOT.
