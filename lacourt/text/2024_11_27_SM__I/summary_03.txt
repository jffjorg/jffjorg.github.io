```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the demurrer brought by ReCon Trust in a wrongful foreclosure case and has sustained it without leave to amend. The court has previously given leave to amend, but the plaintiff has not come close to alleging anything that ReCon Trust allegedly did wrong. The court finds that ReCon Trust's demurrer is well taken because the document attached to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) does not state that ReCon Trust caused the wrongful substitution of attorney. The court also finds that ReCon Trust has not done anything wrong and that the plaintiff's claims fail. The court grants ReCon Trust's request for judicial notice and orders ReCon Trust to submit an Order of Dismissal within 10 days.
