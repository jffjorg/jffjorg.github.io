And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has granted the unopposed motion to file a cross complaint. The judge notes that motions like this are usually granted, but are less common in cases involving unlawful detainer (eviction). However, since possession is no longer at issue in this case, it is more like a regular lawsuit. The judge also suggests that the cross-complaint may be compulsory, meaning it must be filed unless the defendant is acting in bad faith. The defendant must file the cross-complaint as a separate document within 5 court days and serve it on the other party. The cross-defendant will have the usual time to respond to the cross-complaint.
