And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is granting the application for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) in part and denying it in part. The Judge finds that the defendant has been violating the terms of the lease, which prohibits commercial uses, loud uses, smoking, and large gatherings, by hosting large parties and events, including weddings and a carnival, with pyrotechnics and a 200-piece marching band. The Judge is inclined to grant the TRO to the extent that it would require the defendant to refrain from engaging in conduct that requires a permit, specialized insurance, or is against the law.

However, the Judge is not persuaded that the plaintiff is likely to prevail on most of the tort claims, including invasion of privacy, slander of title, and breach of contract, except for potential fraud or nuisance claims. The Judge finds that the defendant's alleged violations are not irreparable and that the plaintiff has an adequate remedy in damages.

The Judge will also order the defendant to restore the security system and will discuss the OSC (Order to Show Cause) regarding the defendant's compliance with the TRO. The Judge is skeptical about the purpose of holding a full-blown hearing on December 10, the day before the lease expires, as it is unclear whether the defendant will not leave the premises when the lease expires.
