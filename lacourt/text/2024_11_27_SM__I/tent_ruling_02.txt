 Case Number:  23SMUD00389    Hearing Date:   November 27, 2024    Dept:  I The unopposed motion to file a cross complaint is
GRANTED.  These sorts of motions are
routinely and liberally granted.  That is
less so in the UD context, where the pleadings are limited.  But here, possession is no longer at issue
and thus the case is more akin to a regular case.  Further, here it might well be that the
cross-complaint is compulsory, in which case the motion must be granted absent
bad faith or the like. 
 
Defendant will have 5 court days to file cross complaint as
a stand-alone document.  Defendant must
also serve the cross complaint. 
Cross-defendant will have the time allowed by law to answer or otherwise
respond.
