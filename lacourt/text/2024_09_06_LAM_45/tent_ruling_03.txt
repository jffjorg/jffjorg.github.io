Background
On
January 4, 2022, Plaintiff Lester Jimenez (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants 25 Art, L.P., Frederick Leeds, and David Oved for negligence
and premises liability. Plaintiff alleges that he was seriously injured
when he fell down a flight of stairs on a fire escape attached to a building on
South Hobart Boulevard in Los Angeles, California, that is owned, operated,
managed, or controlled by Defendants. 
On April 5, 2024, and April 15,
2024, Defendants 25 Art, L.P. and Frederick Leeds
(“Defendants”) filed these two motions
for an order of contempt and imposing contempt sanctions including the issuance
of an arrest warrant for refusal to comply and obey a court order compelling
Gloria Aguirre and Maria Espinoza to comply with a subpoenaed deposition for
appearance and production of documents pursuant to court order.
Legal Standard
 
Contempt is any act, in or out of court, “which tends to
impede, embarrass or obstruct the court in the discharge of its duties.” 
(In re Shortridge (1893) 99 Cal. 526, 532 Particular
acts constituting contempt are enumerated by statute, including:¿
“(d)isobedience of any lawful ... order, or process of the court”;¿
“(d)isobedience of a subpoena duly served”; “refusing to ... answer as a
witness”;¿ “(d)isorderly, contemptuous, or insolent behavior toward the judge
while holding the court, tending to interrupt the due course of ... trial.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1209(a); see also Code Civ. Proc. § 1991 [disobedience of
subpoena]; and Pen.C. § 166 [misdemeanor].) In addition, courts have
inherent power to punish acts that interfere with the orderly conduct of
proceedings.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(3); In re Buckley
(1973) 10 Cal.3d 237, 247.) 
 
Sanctions 
 
CCP section 1218 provides
for reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the party initiating the contempt
proceeding if the court finds the person proceeded against is guilty of
contempt.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1218(a).)
 
CCP section 177.5 provides
the following: 
A judicial officer shall have the power to impose
reasonable money sanctions, not to exceed fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500),
notwithstanding any other provision of law, payable to the court, for any
violation of a lawful court order by a person, done without good cause or
substantial justification.  This power shall not apply to advocacy of
counsel before the court.  For the purposes of this section, the term  “person” includes a
witness, a party, a party’s attorney, or both. Sanctions pursuant to this section shall not be imposed
except on notice contained in a party’s moving or responding papers; or on the
court’s own motion, after notice and opportunity to be heard.  An order
imposing sanctions shall be in writing and shall recite in detail the conduct
or circumstances justifying the order. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 177.5.) 
“The imposition of monetary
sanctions under section 177.5 ‘is within the discretion of the trial
court.’”  (People v. Ward (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1518, 1527
(quoting Winikow v. Superior Court (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 719,
726).)  “‘That discretion must be exercised in a reasonable manner with
one of the statutorily authorized purposes in mind and must be guided by
existing legal standards as adapted to the current circumstances.’”  (Id.
(quoting Winikow, supra, 82 Cal.App.4th at 726).) 
 
Discussion
            Defendants
move for an order of contempt to compel Maria Espinoza and Gloria Aguirre to
comply with the court’s orders for personal appearance and production of
documents at deposition, including the issuance of a bench warrant. Defendants
also seek sanctions against Espinoza and Aguirre.
 
On March 5, 2024, and
March 18, 2024, the court granted Defendants’ motions and ordered Maria
Espinoza and Gloria Aguirre to appear for deposition and produce documents on
March 19, 2024, and April 15, 2024. (Ruiz Decl., Exh. A.) Defendants served a
notice of the court’s ruling on Aguirre and Espinoza. (Id., Exh. B.) They did
not appear. (Id., Exh. C.)
The
contempt at issue is “indirect,” which requires a more elaborate procedure to
notify the person(s) sought to be charged and to allow him or her an
opportunity to be heard.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1211–1218; see also Hanson
v. Superior Court, supra, 91 Cal.App.4th at p. 81.) In general, the
first step in an indirect contempt proceeding is an application for an issuance
of an Order to Show Cause. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1211, subd. (a).) 
 In the application, “[a]n
affidavit must be presented to the court stating the facts constituting the
contempt, an order to show cause must be issued, and hearing on the facts must
be held by the judge.”  (Arthur v. Superior Court (1965) 62 Cal.2d
404, 407-408.)  Since the acts involved did not occur in the court’s
presence, the affidavit (declaration) must cover each element of the commission
of the contempt.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1211.5.)  This affidavit serves
as the “complaint” in indirect contempt proceeding (Lyon v. Superior Court
(1968) 68 Cal.2d 446, 452) and must contain factual allegations based on
firsthand knowledge. 
In
indirect contempt proceedings based on disobedience of a prior court order, a
valid judgment must meet “strict requirements.”¿ Each of the following must be
established: (1) the rendition of a valid court order; (2) actual knowledge of
the order; (3) ability to comply; and (4) willful disobedience of the order. 
(Conn v. Superior Court (1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 774, 784 [repeated
failures to turn over documents as ordered].)  Upon receipt of the
affidavit, the court usually issues an order to show cause (OSC) why the person
should not be held in contempt.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1212.)  
The moving/citing party must then
serve the OSC re Contempt and supporting affidavits/declarations on the
cite/respondent in the same manner as a service of summons – usually personal
service. (Lund v. Super. Ct. (1964) 61 Cal.2d 698, 713; Cedars-Sinai
Imaging Medical Group v. Super. Ct. (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1281, 1286.)
Although not required, the
alleged contemnor may respond to the affidavit and OSC by counteraffidavits or
declarations.  These affidavits serve as the “answer” to the charging
allegations in the original affidavit. (Lyon v. Superior Court, supra,
68 Cal.2d at p. 452.)  Such affidavits are not mandatory, however. The
alleged contemnor may assert his or her defenses entirely at the hearing. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1217.) 
 
Here, Defendants have skipped the important
initial step of seeking the issuance of an OSC. There is no affidavit seeking a
request for an order to show cause. Nor is counsel’s current declaration
sufficient to establish the facts constituting the contempt. Specifically, the
declaration is silent as to whether Aguirre and Espinoza have the ability to
comply and whether they willfully disobeyed the court’s orders. As no such
affidavit has been filed, the Court has not issued an OSC. Nor have Defendants
have not served on the respondents any notice of an OSC by personal service.
 
Accordingly, the
Court is without jurisdiction to proceed with any contempt proceeding against
Aguirre and Espinoza.  Defendants’ motions are DENIED without prejudice.
 
Defendants also request
attorney’s fees and costs.  CCP section 1218 provides for reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs if the court finds the person proceeded against is
guilty of contempt.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1218(a).)  As the motion is
denied, Defendants are not entitled to attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to
CCP section 1218. 
 
Defendants
also request sanctions in the amount of $1,500 be imposed against Aguirre and Espinoza
pursuant to CCP section 177.5. For the same reasons, the
court cannot do so. (See People v. Hundal (2008) 168 Cal. App.
4th 965, 970, (“Due process, as well as the
statute itself, requires that a person against whom Code of Civil Procedure
section 177.5 sanctions may be imposed be given adequate notice that such
sanctions are being considered, notice as to what act or omission of the individual
is the basis for the proposed sanctions, and an objective hearing at which the
person is permitted to address the lawfulness of the order, the existence of
the violation, and the absence of good cause or substantial justification for
the violation.”).) 
Defendants may seek sanctions once they follow the procedural requirements to
initiate contempt proceedings. 
 
            It
is so ordered.
