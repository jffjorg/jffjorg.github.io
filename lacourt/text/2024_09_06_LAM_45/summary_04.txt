Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

This tentative ruling denies the motions of Krystine Wills and Steven Wills to vacate and set aside the default judgment entered against them in August 2018. The default judgment was entered by the Virginia Court after the moving defendants failed to file a response and failed to appear at the hearing. The moving defendants argue that the default judgment should be vacated because the initial loan agreement was between Luke Caldwell and the plaintiffs, not them. However, the court finds that the moving defendants waived their rights to contest the default judgment and that the default judgment should stand. The court also notes that the moving defendants' attempt to continue the hearing is improper and that they will have to file a renewed motion to vacate if their appeal is successful.
