The tentative ruling grants in part and denies in part the defendants' motion to compel further responses to the request for production of documents. The motion is granted as to requests 23 and 24, which seek financial information from the plaintiffs, but denied as to request 28, which seeks attorney's fees information. The court agrees with the plaintiffs that the requests for financial information invade a well-recognized zone of privacy and balances the need for discovery with the right of privacy. The case involves a burglary at the plaintiffs' home, a disputed insurance claim, and a lawsuit filed against the insurance carrier and broker. The plaintiffs seek damages for breach of contract, breach of implied covenant, negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, professional negligence, and fraud.
