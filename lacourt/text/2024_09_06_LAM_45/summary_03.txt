```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motions filed by the defendants, 25 Art, L.P. and Frederick Leeds, for an order of contempt and imposing contempt sanctions against Gloria Aguirre and Maria Espinoza. The court has denied the motions without prejudice, meaning that the defendants can re-file the motions if they follow the proper procedures.

The court found that it lacks jurisdiction to proceed with the contempt proceedings against Aguirre and Espinoza because the defendants failed to file an application for an order to show cause and did not serve the respondents with notice of the order to show cause. The court also found that the defendants' declaration did not establish the facts constituting the contempt, including whether Aguirre and Espinoza had the ability to comply with the court's orders and whether they willfully disobeyed the orders.

The court also denied the defendants' request for attorney's fees and costs because the motion was denied. Additionally, the court denied the defendants' request for sanctions in the amount of $1,500 against Aguirre and Espinoza because the defendants did not follow the proper procedures in initiating the contempt proceedings.
