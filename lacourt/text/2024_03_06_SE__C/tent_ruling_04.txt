 Case Number:  21NWCV00467    Hearing Date:   March 6, 2024    Dept:  C Ideal
Ventures, LLC v. Tim Childress, et al., Case No. 21NWCV00467
 
This
is a breach of contract and conversion action. Plaintiff alleges that it hired
defendants to haul containers from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to
plaintiff’s warehouse. Defendants allegedly overcharged for shipping and did
not deliver one container. Defendant 10PL Global, Inc. moves ex parte to file
an application to set aside the following: (1) default and default judgment
entered against it on February 24, 2022 in favor of plaintiff, and (2) the
default entered against it on August 11, 2022 in favor of cross-complainants
Tim Childress; Axelavate Transportation, LLC; and Axelavate Logistics, LLC. The
statutory basis is Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5. Alternately,
defendant requests the Court enter an order to advance the hearing date of
December 3, 2024. 
 
A
party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing
"irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for
granting relief ex parte." (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c).)
 
The
Court finds irreparable harm and immediate danger. Plaintiff states that the
earliest date to hear defendant 10PL’s motion to set aside and vacate the
default is December 3, 2024. (Decl. Kim, ¶ 8.) The current trial date is
September 24, 2024. 
 
The
Court will not hear the motion today but at an advanced date. A motion to set
aside default brought under Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5 must be
brought by noticed motion. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a).) Thus, the
Court grants the motion to advance the hearing date. The hearing date is
ADVANCED from Tuesday, December 3, 2024, to today’s date and CONTINUED to
Tuesday, April 23, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.
