  Case Number:  19NWCV00820    Hearing Date:   March 6, 2024    Dept:  C Blaine
Holding and Development, Inc. v. Vivera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Case No.
19NWCV00820
 
This
is an unlawful detainer action. Plaintiff and judgment creditor Blaine Holding
& Development LLC moves ex parte to continue the hearing on defendant and
judgment debtor Los Angeles Partyworks, Inc.’s motion to set aside default and
default judgment. The hearing date is March 19, 2024. 
 
A
party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing
"irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for
granting relief ex parte." (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c).)
 
The
Court finds irreparable harm and immediate danger. Plaintiff and judgment
creditor’s counsel attests that he also needs to appear at a contempt hearing
on the same day at the Superior Court of California, Riverside County in Palms
Springs, California. (Decl. Yost, ¶ 6.) On January 29, 2024, Judge Russell M.
Velasquez continued the hearing from January 5, 2024 to March 19, 2024. (Decl.
Yost, ¶¶ 6, 7.) 
 
Thus,
the Court grants the motion to continue the hearing date. The hearing date is
ADVANCED from Tuesday, March 19, 2024, to today’s date and CONTINUED to
Thursday, April 11, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.  Enforcement of the
judgment against defendant and judgment debtor Los Angeles Partyworks is stayed
pending the continued hearing date.  
 
Moving
party to give notice.
