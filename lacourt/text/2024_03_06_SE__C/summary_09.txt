However, the court has sustained the demurrer as to the plaintiff's cause of action for breach of implied warranty, finding that it is time-barred. The court has also sustained the demurrer as to the plaintiff's cause of action for fraudulent concealment, finding that it does not state sufficient facts to state a cause of action and that it is barred by the economic loss rule. The court has given the plaintiff 30 days to amend its complaint.
