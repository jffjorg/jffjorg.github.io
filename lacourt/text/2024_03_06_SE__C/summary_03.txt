And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has granted ATV Inc.'s motion to substitute HYE, LLC as the named plaintiff in the lawsuit against Integrity Insurance Services, Inc. The lawsuit is an insurance broker malpractice action, alleging that Integrity Insurance Services, Inc. failed to procure adequate commercial property insurance for ATV Inc. (also known as American Tire Depot) prior to a fire at 1395 E. Washington Street in Colton, California. The judge found that the substitution of HYE, LLC as the plaintiff would not add new injuries to the lawsuit, as both ATV Inc. and HYE, LLC are named insureds on the insurance policy and have the same interest in the outcome of the lawsuit. The judge also denied the defendant's request for judicial notice of certain documents filed with the California Secretary of State, finding that these documents are not official records. The judge's ruling was based on the legal standard that amendments to a complaint are permitted if there is no change in the claim being asserted, and that the relation-back doctrine requires that the amended complaint rest on the same general set of facts, involve the same injury, and refer to the same instrumentality.
