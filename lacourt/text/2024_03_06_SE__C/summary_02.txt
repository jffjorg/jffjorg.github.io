```

And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's motions for terminating, issue, and monetary sanctions against Defendant Cortazar. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant has misused the discovery process and failed to comply with court orders.

The Judge denied the Plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions, finding that less severe sanctions would be sufficient to address the Defendant's misconduct. The Judge granted the Plaintiff's motion for monetary sanctions, awarding $1,124.77 to the Plaintiff against the Defendant and her counsel.

The Judge also granted the Plaintiff's motion for sanctions in part, awarding $599.77 to the Plaintiff against the Defendant and her counsel. The Judge noted that the Defendant's failure to provide timely responses to discovery requests was due to mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, but did not find that the Defendant acted with substantial justification or that imposing sanctions would serve the interests of justice.

The Judge did not grant issue sanctions, as the Plaintiff did not specify which issues it wanted the Court to strike. The Judge also denied the Defendant's request for a stay on further discovery proceedings pending the outcome of the Plaintiff's criminal trial, as this matter is not the subject of the instant motion.
