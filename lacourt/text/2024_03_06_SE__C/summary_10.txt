Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the first amended complaint filed by plaintiff Edward Santistevan against defendant Sean De La Rosa. The demurrer is sustained in part and overruled in part.

The judge sustains the demurrer to the second cause of action (conversion) because plaintiff has not properly alleged that he has an interest in the decedent's personal property. The judge also sustains the demurrer to the fourth cause of action (breach of fiduciary duty) because plaintiff has not established a fiduciary relationship with the defendant. The judge sustains the demurrer to the fifth cause of action (constructive trust) because plaintiff has not pleaded facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

The judge overrules the demurrer to the sixth cause of action (declaratory relief) because plaintiff has pleaded a proper subject of declaratory relief and an actual controversy exists.

The judge grants defendant's request for judicial notice of certain documents and records, including the first amended complaint, notice of errata, and grant deeds.

The ruling is subject to change after the hearing on March 6, 2024.
