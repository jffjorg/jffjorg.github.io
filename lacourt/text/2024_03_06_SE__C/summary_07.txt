And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Ex Parte Application for an Order Appointing a Discovery Referee filed by Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Company and Miguel Angel Pacheco, without prejudice. The moving party had requested the appointment of a discovery referee to preside over oral depositions due to the manner in which Plaintiff's counsel has conducted herself during several depositions. However, the court found that it lacks authority to appoint a discovery referee because Plaintiff Ani Khachikyan is unable to pay her pro rata share of the costs, and there is no indication that another party has agreed to pay the additional pro rata share. The court notes that the benefits of appointing a discovery referee are apparent, including the ability to more quickly and efficiently resolve outstanding discovery conflicts and address improper conduct during depositions. However, the court's authority to appoint a discovery referee is limited, and in this case, the court is without authority to do so.
