 Case Number:  23NWCV03597    Hearing Date:   March 6, 2024    Dept:  C Bilemjian,
Trustee of Bilemjian Family Revocable Living Trust v. Sanchez, et al., Case No.
23NWCV03597
 
This
is an unlawful detainer action. Plaintiff Hagop Bilemijan, Trustee of the
Bilemijan Family Revocable Living Trust, applies ex parte to advance the
demurrer hearing from Thursday, July 11, 2024 to Friday, March 15, 2024. 
 
A
party may seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing
"irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for
granting relief ex parte." (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c).)
 
The
Court finds irreparable harm. Plaintiff states that by the time the demurrer is
heard in July 2024, it will have accrued at least $45,565.00 in damages of past
owed rent payments and anticipated rent payments. (Decl. Bilemjian, ¶ 3.)
Plaintiff also states that the delay will hinder its ability to mitigate
damages. (Decl. Bilemjian, ¶ 4.) 
 
Thus,
the Court grants the motion to advance the hearing date. The hearing date is
ADVANCED from Thursday, July 11, 2024, to today’s date and CONTINUED to
Thursday, March 21, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C. 
 
Moving
party to give notice.
