And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to set aside the defaults entered against them. The defendants, Olary Yim Ambrosi, et al., had filed a motion to set aside the defaults entered on January 12, 2024, claiming that the defaults were entered due to excusable neglect, fraud, and/or mistake. The judge has found that the defendants' former counsel, Joseph Hobaica, abandoned them and failed to take necessary actions to protect their interests. The judge has also considered the discretionary factors, including the defendants' own conduct in pursuing and following up the case, and has found that the defendants' actions were not entirely free from blame, but that the abandonment by Hobaica was the primary cause of the defaults. The judge has ordered the defendants to file and serve their proposed responsive pleading(s) within 3 days of this date.
