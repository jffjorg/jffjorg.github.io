            Demurring party objects to the entirety of the first amended cross-complaint.

 
BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiff HNYR is an organization
comprised of individuals who support the Chinese Whistleblower Movement.
Nonparty Himalaya Exchange developed and sells a form of digital asset called
Himalaya Coins (“H-Coins”). H-Coins are owned and traded by HNYR’s members, as
well as members of organizations with similar ideologies, and the general
public. On March 20, 2023, HNYR brought the instant action to recover damages
it suffered as the result of Defendant’s allegedly fraudulent sale of H-Coins. 
 
On August 15, 2023, Defendant Chu filed a
first amended cross-complaint (“FACC”) against HYNR and Ho Wan Kwok based on
fraudulent misrepresentation/inducement and negligent misrepresentation. On
July 18, 2024, the court entered Chu’s request to dismiss Ho Wan Kwok without
prejudice.
 
HYNR demurs to the FACC, arguing it fails
to plead facts with sufficient particularity to support all three of its
fraud-based Causes of Action.
 
TENTATIVE RULING
 
The demurrer as to all causes of
action is OVERRULED.
 
LEGAL STANDARD
 
A general
demurrer may be taken to a complaint where “[t]he pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.” (Code of Civ. Proc. § 430.10(e).) A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the
complaint states a cause of action.  (Hahn
v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal. App. 4th 740, 747.) In a demurrer proceeding, the
defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper judicial
notice.  (Code Civ. Proc. section
430.30(a).)  A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or
other extrinsic matters.  (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal. App. 3d 902, 905.)  The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is
whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters,
states a cause of action.  (Hahn v.
Mirda, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
A demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the pleading, not the truth of
the plaintiff’s allegations or accuracy of the described conduct. (Bader v.
Anderson (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 775, 787.) The allegations in the pleading
are deemed to be true no matter how improbable the allegations may seem. (Del
E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604.)
The court, however, does not accept the truth of contentions, deductions, or
conclusions of law. (Genesis Environment Services v. San Joaquin Valley
Unified Air Pollution Control District (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 597, 603.)
 
Additionally, a
special demurrer to a complaint may be brought on the ground the pleading is
uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible. Code Civ. Proc section 430.10(f); Beresford Neighborhood Assn. v. City of
San Mateo (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1180, 1191.) A demurrer based
on uncertainty is disfavored and will be strictly construed even when the
pleading is uncertain in some respects. (Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc. (1993) 14
Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) A demurrers based on uncertainty are “granted only if
the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably
respond.” (Lickiss v. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (2012) 208
Cal.App.4th 1125, 1135.) 
 
DISCUSSION
 
            HNYR demurs to Chu’s FACC on the grounds the FACC does not state facts
sufficient to constitute any of the causes of action.
 
First Cause of
Action for Intentional Misrepresentation (Fraud)
 
To prove fraud, the first cause of
action, plaintiffs must show the following elements: (1) misrepresentation, (2)
knowledge of falsity, (3) intent to induce reliance, (4) reliance, and (5)
damages. (Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th
979, 990.) Additionally, the fraud cause of action must be plead with
specificity that shows “how when, where, to whom, and by what means the
representations were tendered.” (Hamilton v. Greenwich Investors XXVI, LLC
(2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 1602, 1614.) 
 
Here, the first cause of action meets
the specificity requirement. Chu pleads
a variety of actions involving misrepresentations on the part of HNYR. Chu has pled
with sufficient specificity the facts surrounding the alleged fraud. Chu alleges
when the fraud occurred—between February 2019 and December 2021. Chu alleges
HNYR convinced and induced Chu to donate $200,000.00 to entities allegedly
affiliated with HNYR, and to exchange his money for cryptocurrency. The FACC
alleges his money was never used as expected and instead was spent by Kwok and
his associates for buying real estate, luxury cars and yachts, jewelry, and
other expenses to support their lavish lifestyle. Chu alleges HNYR knew of the
illegality and fraudulent scheme behind the solicitations for donations from
Chu. Taking the allegations as true, the FACC has shown a misrepresentation,
knowledge of falsity, intent to induce reliance, reliance, and damages. Plaintiff
has pled the facts underlying his claim for fraud with the required
specificity.
 
The demurrer to the first cause of action is OVERRULED. 
 
Second Cause of
Action for Promise Without Intent to Perform (Fraud)
 
“The elements of promissory fraud . . . are: (1) a promise made regarding
a material fact without any intention of performing it; (2) the existence of
the intent not to perform at the time the promise was made; (3) intent to
deceive or induce the promise to enter into a transaction; (4) reasonable
reliance by the promisee; (5) nonperformance by the party making the promise;
and (6) resulting damage to the promisee.” (Rossberg v. Bank of America,
N.A. (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1481, 1498.) Promissory fraud must be alleged
with particularity. (Id.)
 
Chu’s second cause of action is based on the same alleged promise as his
misrepresentation causes of action. That is, HNYR and Kwok made promises upon
which Chu relied on and gave $200,000.00 and his “cryptocurrency” to them.
These allegations, if taken as true, meet the elements of false promise. This
fraud claim is pled with the required specificity. 
 
The demurrer to the second cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
Third Cause of
Action for Negligent Misrepresentation (Fraud)
 
The elements of negligent
misrepresentation are “[m]isrepresentation of a past or existing material fact,
without reasonable ground for believing it to be true, and with intent to
induce another's reliance on the fact misrepresented; ignorance of the truth
and justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation by the party to whom it was
directed; and resulting damage. (Hydro-Mill Co., Inc. v. Hayward, Tilton,
& Rolapp Ins. Associates, Inc. (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 1145, 1154.) A negligent misrepresentation cause of action
must be pled with specificity. (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc.
(2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 184.)
 
Moreover, “[s]tatements as to future action are do not
constitute actionable fraud. (Tarmann v. State Farm Mutual Automobile
Insurance Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 158.) Rather, the misrepresentation
must pertain to past or existing material facts. (Ibid.) The demurrer argues
any misrepresentation Chu alludes to in the FACC is a prediction of the future
instead of one of past or existing material fact. The Court disagrees. One
example of an alleged promise in the FACC is that Chu’s money would be invested
or donated but instead, his money was spent on things to support Kwok and his
associates’ lavish lifestyle. This was not a statement as to future action.
 
The FACC’s third cause of action is based on the same alleged
misrepresentations as the intentional misrepresentation cause of action. For
the same reasons set forth above, the Court concludes that Chu has sufficiently
alleged a misrepresentation about a past or existing material fact. (Tarmann,
supra, 2 Cal.App.4th at 158.)
The demurrer to the third cause of action is OVERRULED.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer as to all causes of
action is OVERRULED.
 
Moving party to give notice.
