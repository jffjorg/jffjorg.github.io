Here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the plaintiffs' motion to compel compliance with subpoenas issued to eight banks to produce financial records related to judgment debtors Jianqiang Gu and his entities. The Judge found that Gu, as a party to the action, should have filed a motion to quash the subpoena instead of serving objections to the subpoena. The Judge also found that the community property of Gu and his spouse, Ying Guan, is liable for the judgment debt of Gu. The Judge ordered the banks to provide complete, objection-free verified responses to the plaintiffs and awarded sanctions of $9,600 to the plaintiffs for filing costs. The Judge also noted that the plaintiffs sufficiently demonstrated that post-judgment discovery was properly served to the banks, who would not produce documents to Gu and Guan's objections.
