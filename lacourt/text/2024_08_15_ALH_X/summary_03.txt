And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of an order granting a motion to quash service of summons on the grounds that the defendant Fuxian Zhang is not the person named in the First Amended Complaint. The plaintiff argues that Fuxian Zhang is the correct person, but the court finds that the plaintiff has failed to meet its burden to establish the existence of new or different facts along with a satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce the evidence at an earlier time. The court agrees with the defendant's opposition that the plaintiff offers no evidence that Fuxian Zhang is not the person who showed up on the video call, and that Fuxian Zhang's father's name is Taian Zhang, not Liqiang Zhang. The motion for reconsideration is denied.
