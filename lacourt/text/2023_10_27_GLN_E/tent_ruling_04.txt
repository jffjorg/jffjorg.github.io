- TENTATIVE RULINGS ON (2) MOTIONS TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES 
BACKGROUND

Plaintiff
filed a Complaint on 01/11/2023. The Court heard Defendant, Beny Sarksian’s,
Demurrer to the Complaint on 04/21/2023.
On 05/02/2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended
Complaint (FAC) alleging the following nine causes of action: (1) Damages for
Breach of Oral Agreement, (2) Damages for Breach of Written Agreement, (3)
Damages for Breach of Fiduciary Duty, (4) Damages for Fraud, (5) Damages for
Fraud, (6) Promissory Estoppel, (7) Accounting, (8) Damages for Unjust
Enrichment, and (9) Dissolution of Partnership. The first through sixth causes
of action were alleged against Defendant Sarksian only. The seventh through
ninth causes of action were alleged against all Defendants.
On 08/18/2023, the Court heard Defendant’s demurrer to
the second, fourth, and eighth causes of action in the FAC, and the Court heard
Defendant’s motion to strike as to the FAC.
The Court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend
as to the second cause of action for breach of written agreement. The Court
sustained without leave to amend the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for
fraud (intentional misrepresentation). The Court sustained without leave to
amend the demurrer to the eighth cause of action for unjust enrichment.
On 08/28/2023, Plaintiff filed a Second Amended
Complaint (SAC) alleging six causes of action: (1) Damages for Breach of Oral
Agreement, (2) Damages for Breach of Fiduciary Duty, (3) Damages for Fraud
(Negligent Misrepresentation), (4) Promissory Estoppel, (5) Accounting, and (6)
Dissolution of Partnership. The first through fourth causes of action are
alleged against Defendant Sarksian. The fifth through sixth causes of action
are alleged against all Defendants – Beny Sarksian and E Che Pizza & Pasta
& More LLC.
In the SAC, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant,
Sarksian, in July 2019 approached him and made a business proposal. (SAC ¶ 7.)
Plaintiff alleges that Sarksian had no financial ability to create or maintain
a business of his own and represented to Plaintiff that if Plaintiff
contributed financial resources to a restaurant business, Sarksian would handle
the day-to-day operations of the parties’ business. (SAC ¶8.)
Plaintiff alleges that Sarksian represented to
Plaintiff that Sarksian would have Defendant-LLC created and that he, Sarksian,
would manage and operate the resulting restaurant and would pay all profits
equally to Plaintiff and Sarksian. (SAC ¶9.) Plaintiff alleges that he gave
Sarksian at least $25,000.00 to form Defendant-LLC and to operate a restaurant.
(SAC ¶10.) Plaintiff alleges that pursuant to the parties’ agreement,
Defendant-LLC was created wherein Plaintiff and Sarksian were equal members in
Defendant-LLC and the restaurant business. (SAC ¶11.)
Plaintiff alleges that pursuant to the parties’
agreement, Plaintiff executed a written property lease so that Defendant-LLC
had a location from which to conduct a restaurant business. (SAC ¶12.) 
Plaintiff alleges that Sarksian failed and refused to
honor the parties’ agreement, and unbeknownst to Plaintiff, engaged in a scheme
to take, for himself and for all defendants, funds received by the restaurant
through its operations, excluding Plaintiff from those funds. (SAC ¶15.)
These two motions are motions to compel further
responses. Both are filed by Defendant, Beny Sarksian.
MOTION 1 – Compel Further Responses to Form
Interrogatories, Set One
RELIEF REQUESTED


Defendant Beny Sarksian moves this
Court pursuant to CCP § 2030.300 for an order compelling Plaintiff, Vahan Der
Grigorian, to serve further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, without
objection.
Defendant also move this Court for an
order pursuant to CCP §§ 2023.020, 2023.030, and 2030.300(d), that Plaintiff
Vahan Der Grigorian and his counsel of record, Anahid Agemian, shall pay a
monetary sanction to Defendant Beny Sarksian in at least the sum of $9,429.74
for reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred by the moving party in
connection with the necessity of making this motion.

LEGAL STANDARD - COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO
INTERROGATORIES


Under CCP § 2017.010, “any party may
obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the
subject matter involved in the pending action..., if the matter either is
itself admissible in evidence or appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence.”  The
Section specifically provides that “[d]iscovery may relate to the claim or
defense of the party seeking discovery or of any other party to the action,”
and that discovery “may be obtained of the identity and location of persons
having knowledge of any discoverable matter, as well as of the existence,
description, nature, custody, condition and location of any document,
electronically stored information, tangible thing, or land or other property.”
On receipt of a response to interrogatories,
the propounding party may move for an order compelling a further response if
the propounding party deems that any of the following apply:
(1)  
An answer
to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.
(2)  
An
exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate.
(3)  
An
objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.
(CCP §2030.300(a).
If
a timely motion to compel has been filed, the¿burden is on the responding
party¿to justify any objection or failure fully to answer.¿(Coy v. Superior
Court of Contra Costa County (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220–221 [addressing a
motion to compel further responses to interrogatories]; see also¿Fairmont
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court¿(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)  
Furthermore,
to the extent there is any doubt in whether these records should be
discoverable, California’s liberal approach to discovery provides that doubt
should be resolved in favor of permitting discovery. (Pacific Tel. &
Tel. Co. v. Superior Court (1970) 2 Cal.3d 161, 173.)
The
party to whom interrogatories have been propounded shall respond in writing
under oath separately to each interrogatory by any of the following:
(1) An
answer containing the information sought to be discovered.
(2) An
exercise of the party’s option to produce writings.
(3) An
objection to the particular interrogatory.
 
(CCP
§2030.210(a).)
ANALYSIS

As a preliminary matter, Defendant
does not state in its motion or notice of motion which form interrogatories
Defendant is moving to compel further responses to. 
However, based on Defendant’s
Separate Statement, Defendant appears to be moving to compel further responses
to Form Interrogatories (FROGs), Set One, numbers: 2.7, 2.9, 3.6, 3.7, 8.2,
9.1, 9.2, 12.1, 12.6, and 17.1 re: RFAs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34,
35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, and 52.
Meet and Confer
“A motion under subdivision (a) shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (CCP
§2030.300(b)(1).)
Plaintiff argues that the meet and confer was
not in good faith. Plaintiff states that Mr. Stein waiting 2 days before the
time to file Defendant’s motions to demand further responses was not proper. The
Court does not find this argument availing. First, Plaintiff offers no legal
support to establish that this was not proper. Second, Plaintiff provides no
proof that the meet and confer was not in good faith. Plaintiff simply
concludes the meet and confer was not in good faith and provides no arguments
as to why. Further, Plaintiff could have extended the deadline for Defendant to
file this motion.
DISCUSSION

FROGs 2.9, 8.2, 12.1, 12.6, and 17.1
Plaintiff
stated in its Opposition that further responses were served to all FROGs except
2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 9.1, and 9.2. Both parties seem to agree that as to the FROGs in
which further responses were served, compelling further responses is moot;
however, the issue of sanctions on those FROGs is not moot. 
The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion to compel further
responses to FROGs 2.9, 8.2, 12.1, 12.6, and 17.1 as MOOT because Plaintiff
served further responses; however, sanctions are not moot as to those FROGs.
FROGs 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 9.1, and 9.2
As
to FROGs 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 9.1, and 9.2, Plaintiff stated that he has not served
further responses.
FROG 2.7
State:

(a) The name and address of each school or other academic or vocational
institution you have attended beginning with high school;
(b) The dates you attended; 
(c) The highest grade level you have completed; and, 
(d) The degree received.
Response FROG 2.7
Objection,
irrelevant and not calculated to lead to any admissible evidence.
FROG 3.6
Have
you done business under a fictitious name during the past 10 years? If so, for
each fictitious name state: (a) The name; (b) The dates each was used; (c) The
state and county of each fictitious name filing; and, (d) The address of the
principal place of business.
Response FROG 3.6
Objection,
irrelevant and not calculated to lead to any admissible evidence; interrogatory
directed to an individual not a business.
FROG 3.7
With
the past five years has any public entity registered or licensed your business?
If so, for each license or registration: (a) Identify the license or
registration; (b) State the name of the public entity; and, (c) State the dates
of issuance and expiration.
Response FROG 3.7
Objection,
irrelevant and not calculated to lead to any admissible evidence; interrogatory
directed to an individual not a business.
FROG 9.1
Are
there any other damages that you attribute to the incident? If so, for each
item of damage state: (a) The amount; (b) The date it occurred; (c) The amount;
and, (d) The name, address, and telephone number of each person to whom an
obligation was incurred.
Response FROG 9.1
Objection,
vague and ambiguous as to the term “other damages.”
FROG 9.2
Do
any documents support the existence or amount of any item of damages claimed in
interrogatory 9.1? If so, describe each document and state the name, address,
and telephone number of the person who has each document.
Response FROG 9.2
Not
applicable.
TENTATIVE RULING MOTION 1
As
to FROG, Set One, Numbers 2.9, 8.2, 12.1, 12.6, and 17.1, the Court denies
Defendant’s motion as MOOT because Plaintiff served further responses; however,
sanctions are not moot as to those FROGs.
As to FROGs 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 9.1, and 9.2, Defendant’s
motion to compel further responses, without objections, is GRANTED. As to 2.7,
3.6, 3.7, and 9.1, 
Plaintiff’s responses included objections, and those
objections were waived. As discussed in Defendant’s motion, Plaintiff did not
serve initial responses within 30 days, and Plaintiff did not serve responses
by the extended deadline that Defendant gave to Plaintiff. “If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the following
rules apply: (a) The party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives
any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as
well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its
determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The
party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with
Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. (2) The party’s
failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect.” (CCP §2030.290(a).) 
Plaintiff did not move to be relieved from waiver of objections.
As to FROG 9.2, the response did not assert an objection, but instead stated,
“Not applicable.” However, FROG 9.2 is based on FROG 9.1, and the Court has
compelled a further response to FROG 9.1. 
Defendant’s motion to compel further responses to
FROGs 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 9.1, and 9.2 is GRANTED. Plaintiff is to provide further,
verified responses, without objection, within 10 days from the date of this
hearing.
Sanctions

“The court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to
the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP §2030.300(d).)
“The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed.” (Cal. Rules of
Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
Defendant
moves for this Court for order that Plaintiff, Vahan Der Grigorian, and his
counsel of record, Anahid Agemian, shall pay a monetary sanction to Defendant
Beny Sarksian in at least the sum of $9,429.74 for reasonable attorneys’ fees
and expenses incurred by the moving party in connection with the necessity of
making this motion.
Defendant’s
counsel, Stein, explains his sanctions request as follows:
As the direct result of Plaintiff’s service of
discovery responses containing frivolous objections, and the result of Plaintiff’s
refusal to amend even a single response, following the “meet and confer”
effort, Defendant has unnecessarily incurred attorney’s fees and costs in the
preparation, filing and hearing of this motion. Specifically, Defendant has
incurred and will incur prorated attorney’s fees in at least the amount of
$9,350.00 (representing 12 hours prorated for the preparation of this motion as
one of four), and an expected additional two and a half hours in connection
with reviewing the opposing papers and preparing a reply memorandum, and two
and a half hours in preparation for and attending the hearing on this motion,
at Defendant’s counsel’s customary hourly rate of $550 per hour), plus filing
fees in the amount of $79.74 ($60.00, plus e-filing service fees of $19.74).
Accordingly, Defendant Sarksian seeks an ordcr awarding monetary sanctions in
his favor of at least $9,429.74.
 
(Stein Decl. ¶3.)
 
In Opposition, Plaintiff argues that “Mr. Stein
waiting 2 days before the time to file Defendant’s motions to demand further
responses was not proper.” (Oppo. p.3.) The Court does not find this argument
availing as Plaintiff provides no legal support for this argument. Plaintiff
also argues that the meet and confer was not in good faith. The Court also does
not find this argument availing either. Plaintiff provides no proof that the
meet and confer was not in good faith. Plaintiff simply concludes the meet and
confer was not in good faith and provides no arguments as to why. Further,
Plaintiff could have extended the deadline for Defendant to file this motion. 
 
Additionally, Plaintiff stated that nowhere in Mr.
Stein’s communication was there any indication that that is what was taking
place. Presumably, Plaintiff is referring to the meet and confer and is arguing
that since the Defendant’s meet and confer didn’t state that the communication
was a meet and confer, a meet and confer did not occur. The Court also finds
this argument unavailing because the Plaintiff provided the Court with no
evidence to evaluate the meet and confer. Plaintiff just made conclusions as to
the inadequacy of the meet and confer and has provided the Court no ability to
determine what happened because no email exchanges or letters were provided to
the Court in moving, opposing, or reply papers.
 
The issue of sanctions will be taken up at the
hearing.

 
MOTION 2 – Compel
Further Responses, SROGs, Set One
RELIEF REQUESTED

Defendant
Beny Sarksian moves this Court pursuant to CCP § 2030.300 for an order
compelling Plaintiff Vahan Der Grigorian to serve further responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, without objection.
Defendant will also move this Court for an order
pursuant to CCP §§ 2023.020, 2023.030, 2030.300(d), that Plaintiff Vahan Der
Grigorian and his counsel of record, Anahid Agemian, shall pay a monetary
sanction to Defendant Beny Sarksian in at least the sum of $9,429.74 for
reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred by the moving party in
connection with the necessity of making this motion.

ANALYSIS

As a preliminary matter, Defendant
does not state in its motion or notice of motion which Special Interrogatories
Defendant is moving to compel further responses to. However, based on
Defendant’s Separate Statement, Defendant appears to be moving to compel
further responses to Special Interrogatories (SROGs), Set One, numbers: 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26,
27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46,
48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55.
45-Day
Requirement

“Unless notice of this motion is given within
45 days of the service of the verified response, or any supplemental verified
response, or on or before any specific later date to which the propounding
party and the responding party have agreed in writing, the propounding party
waives any right to compel a further response to the interrogatories.” (CCP
§2030.300(c).)
Neither party
addresses whether the instant motion is timely. In Plaintiff’s Opposition,
Plaintiff notes how the deadline to file a motion to compel further responses
would expire on July 7, 2023; however, Plaintiff does not state whether this
motion was filed by the deadline. Here, Defendant’s motion appears to be filed
by the deadline indicated in Plaintiff’s Opposition. Therefore, the Court finds
this motion timely since neither party argued otherwise. 
Meet and
Confer

“A motion under subdivision (a) shall be
accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (CCP
§2030.300(b)(1).)
Plaintiff argues that
the meet and confer was not in good faith. Plaintiff states that Mr. Stein
waiting 2 days before the time to file Defendant’s motions to demand further
responses was not proper. The Court does not find this argument availing.
First, Plaintiff offers no legal support to establish that this was not proper.
Second, Plaintiff provides no proof that the meet and confer was not in good
faith. Plaintiff simply concludes the meet and confer was not in good faith and
provides no arguments as to why. Further, Plaintiff could have extended the
deadline for Defendant to file this motion.
 
DISCUSSION
The Plaintiff
states in Opposition that he served further responses on September 13, 2023.
Both parties seem to agree that this motion is moot with respect to compelling
further responses. However, the Court notes that this motion is not moot as to
sanctions.
 
TENTATIVE RULING

Defendant’s
motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories, set one, is
DENIED as moot because Plaintiff served further responses after the filing of
this motion. However, this motion is not moot as to sanctions.  


“The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a further
response to interrogatories, unless it finds that the one subject to the
sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make
the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP §2030.300(d).)
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
Defendant moves for this Court for order that
Plaintiff, Vahan Der Grigorian, and his counsel of record, Anahid Agemian,
shall pay a monetary sanction to Defendant Beny Sarksian in at least the sum of
$9,429.74 for reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred by the moving
party in connection with the necessity of making this motion.
Defendant’s counsel, Stein, explains his sanctions
request as follows:
As the direct
result of Plaintiff’s service of discovery responses containing frivolous
objections, and the result of Plaintiff’s refusal to amend even a single
response, following the “meet and confer” effort, Defendant has unnecessarily
incurred attorney’s fees and costs in the preparation, filing and hearing of
this motion. Specifically, Defendant has incurred and will incur prorated
attorney’s fees in at least the amount of $9,350.00 (representing 12 hours
prorated for the preparation of this motion as one of four), and an expected
additional two and a half hours in connection with reviewing the opposing
papers and preparing a reply memorandum, and two and a half hours in preparation
for and attending the hearing on this motion, at Defendant’s counsel’s
customary hourly rate of $550 per hour), plus filing fees in the amount of
$79.74 ($60.00, plus e-filing service fees of $19.74). Accordingly, Defendant
Sarksian seeks an ordcr awarding monetary sanctions in his favor of at least
$9,429.74.
 
(Stein Decl. ¶3.)
 
In Opposition,
Plaintiff argues that “Mr. Stein waiting 2 days before the time to file
Defendant’s motions to demand further responses was not proper.” (Oppo. p.3.)
The Court does not find this argument availing as Plaintiff provides no legal
support for this argument. Plaintiff also argues that the meet and confer was
not in good faith. The Court also does not find this argument availing either.
Plaintiff provides no proof that the meet and confer was not in good faith.
Plaintiff simply concludes the meet and confer was not in good faith and
provides no arguments as to why. Further, Plaintiff could have extended the
deadline for Defendant to file this motion. 
 
Additionally,
Plaintiff stated that nowhere in Mr. Stein’s communication was there any
indication that that is what was taking place. Presumably, Plaintiff is
referring to the meet and confer and is arguing that since the Defendant’s meet
and confer didn’t state that the communication was a meet and confer, a meet
and confer did not occur. The Court also finds this argument unavailing because
the Plaintiff provided the Court with no evidence to evaluate the meet and
confer. Plaintiff just made conclusions as to the inadequacy of the meet and
confer and has provided the Court no ability to determine what happened.
Additionally, in Reply, Defendant’s counsel submits emails showing that
Defendant gave Plaintiff the option to have more time to respond to the meet
and confer, and Plaintiff’s counsel ignored this issue.
 
The issue of
sanctions will be taken up at the hearing.
 
The Court notes
once again, as it observed at the hearing in this matter on 10/20/23—on yet
another discovery dispute between counsel—that the meet-and-confer process in
this matter appears to have broken down. Counsel are reminded that discovery is
meant to be a process handled by counsel, in good faith, extending professional
courtesy to opposing counsel, with discussions conducted calmly and
professionally—and ideally without need to resort to court intervention: 
 
We feel compelled to observe that resort to the courts
easily could have been avoided here had both parties actually taken to heart
Justice Stone's admonitions . . .  that
the statute requires that there be a serious effort at negotiation and informal
resolution. . . . Perhaps . . .  it is
necessary to remind trial counsel and the bar once again that argument is not
the same as informal negotiation . . . ; that attempting informal resolution
means more than the mere attempt by the discovery proponent to persuade the
objector of the error of his ways . . .; and that a reasonable and good faith
attempt at informal resolution entails something more than bickering with [opposing]
counsel.... Rather, the law requires that counsel attempt to talk the matter
over, compare their views, consult, and deliberate.
