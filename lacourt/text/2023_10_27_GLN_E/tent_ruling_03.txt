TENTATIVE RULINGS – COMPEL RESPONSES
BACKGROUND


Plaintiff, Knarik Gharakhanian, filed a Complaint on
01/06/2023 against Defendants, Glendale Adventist Medical Center and
Cornerstone Construction Group, Inc. Plaintiff’s Complaint alleges two causes
of action – (1) Premises Liability and (2) General Negligence. 
 
Plaintiff alleges that while they were in Defendant Glendale
Adventist Health Center’s place of business as a patron, active construction
work was conducted by Cornerstone Construction, and Plaintiff tripped over an
object on the floor that caused Plaintiff to fall.
 
On 06/02/2023, Defendant, Cornerstone Construction Group,
Inc., filed a Cross-Complaint against Chapala Concrete, Inc. alleging six
causes of action for: (1) Equitable Indemnity, (2) Apportionment, (3)
Contribution, (4) Total Indemnity, (5) Declaratory Relief, and (6) Negligence.
 
Motion 1 pertains to Defendant, Glendale Adventist Medical
Center dba Adventist Health Glendale, moving to compel responses from Plaintiff,
Knarik Gharakhanian, to Request for Production of Documents, Set One.
 
Motion 2 pertains to Defendant, Glendale Adventist
Medical Center dba Adventist Health Glendale, moving to compel responses from
Plaintiff, Knarik Gharakhanian, to Requests for
Admissions, Set One. 
 
MOTION 1
 
RELIEF REQUESTED¿ 
 
Defendant, Glendale
Adventist Medical Center dba Adventist Health Glendale, moves for an order
compelling Plaintiff Knarik Gharakhanian to respond to Request for Production
of Documents, Set One propounded by Defendant and electronically served on May
11, 2023, and for sanctions against Plaintiff and her attorney of record in the
amount of $940.00.
 
This motion is
made on the grounds that plaintiff has failed to serve responses to Defendant’s
Request for Production of Documents, Set One within the 30 days allotted by
California Code of Civil Procedure § 2031.260 and within the extensions
provided by defense counsel.
 
The Court’s
tentative is to grant the motion and impose sanctions.
 

LEGAL STANDARD – COMPEL RESPONSES, INSPECTION DEMANDS


Within 30 days after service of a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, the party to whom the demand is
directed shall serve the original of the response to it on the party making the
demand, and a copy of the response on all other parties who have appeared in
the action, unless on motion of the party making the demand, the court has
shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the party to whom the
demand has been directed, the court has extended the time for response. (CCP § 2031.260(a).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party making the demand may move for an order compelling response to the
demand. (CCP § 2031.300(b).)
If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the
party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is
directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege
or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with § 2018.010). (CCP
§ 2031.300(a).) 
“The court, on motion, may relieve that party from
this waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are
satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in
substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240,
and 2031.280. (2) The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result
of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP §2031.300(a)(1)-(2).)
Unlike a motion to compel further responses, a motion
to compel responses is not subject to a 45-day time limit, and the propounding
party does not have to demonstrate either good cause or that it satisfied a
“meet and confer” requirement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v.
Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404
citing Weil and Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The
Rutter Group 2006) ¶¶8:1137 to 8:1144, pp. 8F-59 to 8F-60, ¶¶ 8:1483 to 8:1489,
pp. 8H-29 to hH-30 (Weil & Brown).)



ANALYSIS

On
May 11, 2023, Defendant propounded Request for Production of Documents, Set
One, on Plaintiff. (Schofield Decl. ¶3.) 
Defendant argues that the responses were due on or
before June 12, 2023. Defendant states that Plaintiff did not serve responses
by June 12, 2023, and Defendant states that Plaintiff did not request an
extension to respond. (Schofield Decl. ¶3.) 
On June 21, 2023, Defendant emailed Plaintiff and stated
that responses had not been received and that Defendant wanted verified
responses, without objections, no later than 6/30. (Schofield Decl. ¶4, Ex. B.)

On June 22, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel stated that for
some reason it [presumably the discovery] was not in his file, that he called
his client, and that he would have her come in next week so that they can
complete this and email it back. (Ex. B.) 
On July 21, 2023, Defendant’s counsel emailed
Plaintiff’s counsel stating that Defendant is still waiting for Plaintiff’s
client’s responses. (Decl. Schofield ¶5, Ex B. [Defendant’s counsel refers to
this as Ex. C; however, there is no Exhibit C labeled in the declaration.]) 
As of the date of Defense counsel Schofield’s
declaration, Plaintiff had neither responded to Defendant nor served responses.
(Schofield Decl. ¶6.)
TENTATIVE RULING MOTION 1

Plaintiff did not serve
responses within 30 days of service of the requests; nor did Plaintiff serve
responses by the extended date to respond. Plaintiff also had not served
responses as of the date of Defendant’s counsel’s declaration on July 31, 2023.
Plaintiff has waived any objections to these requests.
Defendant’s
motion to compel responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, is
GRANTED if Defendant can show service of the instant motion. Plaintiff is to
provide verified responses, without objection, within 10 days following the
hearing of this motion.

Sanctions


Defendant moves for sanctions in the sum of $940.00
against Plaintiff and her counsel. Confusingly, Defendant’s notice page states
that this motion is made pursuant to § 2031.300; however, in the motion with
respect to sanctions, Defendant requests sanctions under §§ 2030.290(c) and
2023.010(d). 
The Court notes that § 2030.290(c) is not the proper
section to rely on to request sanctions because it pertains to interrogatories.
These are requests for production.
In relevant part, § 2031.300(c) states as follows:
Except as provided
in subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.
 
(CCP § 2031.300(c).)
 
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
Defendant’s counsel, Kylie Schofield, states she spent
2 hours drafting the motion, anticipates one hour reviewing opposition and
drafting replies, anticipates one hour attending the hearing on this motion,
and incurred $60.00 to file this motion. (Decl. Schofield, ¶7.) Counsel also
stated that her billing rate was $220.00 per hour.  There was no opposition filed.
The issue of
sanctions will be taken up at the hearing.
 
MOTION 2
 
RELIEF REQUESTED¿
 
Defendant,
Glendale Adventist Medical Center dba Adventist Health Glendale moves for an
order deeming the truth of all matters specified in Requests for Admissions,
Set One, propounded by Defendant and served on Plaintiff on May 11, 2023,
admitted, and issuing sanctions against Plaintiff and her attorney of record in
the amount of $1160.00.
 
This motion is
made on the grounds that Plaintiff Knarik Gharakhanian has failed to serve
responses to Defendant’s Request for Admissions, Set One within the 30 days
allotted by California Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.280 and within the
extensions provided by defense counsel.


LEGAL STANDARD –REQUEST TO DEEM ADMISSIONS ADMITTED


“Within 30 days after service of requests for admission, the party to
whom the requests are directed shall serve the original of the response to them
on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on all other parties who
have appeared, unless on motion of the requesting party the court has shortened
the time for response, or unless on motion of the responding party the court
has extended the time for response.” (CCP § 2033.250(a).)
 
If a party to whom
requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of any documents
and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted, as
well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010). (CCP § 2033.280(b).) 
Further, “If
a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the following rules apply: (a) The party to whom the requests for
admission are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4
(commencing with § 2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from
this waiver on its determination that both of the following conditions are
satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in
substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210, 2033.220, and 2033.230. (2) The
party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 2033.280(a).)
“The court shall
make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220.” (CCP § 2033.280(c).)
 
ANALYSIS

On
May 11, 2023, Defendant propounded Requests for Admissions, Set One, on
Plaintiff. (Schofield Decl. ¶3.) Defendant argues that the responses were due
on or before June 12, 2023. Defendant states that Plaintiff did not serve
responses by June 12, 2023, and Defendant states that Plaintiff did not request
an extension to respond. (Schofield Decl. ¶3.) 
On June 21, 2023, Defendant emailed Plaintiff and
stated that responses had not been received and that Defendant wanted verified
responses, without objections, no later than 6/30. (Schofield Decl. ¶4, Ex. B.)

On June 22, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel stated that for
some reason it [presumably the discovery] was not in his file, that he called
his client, and that he would have her come in next week so that they can
complete this and email it back. (Ex. B.) 
On July 21, 2023, Defendant’s counsel emailed
Plaintiff’s counsel stating that Defendant was still waiting for Plaintiff’s
client’s responses. (Decl. Schofield ¶5, Ex B. [Defendant’s counsel refers to
this as Ex. C; however, there is no Exhibit C labeled in the declaration.]) 
As of the date [7/31/2023] of Defense counsel
Schofield’s declaration, Plaintiff had neither responded to Defendant nor
served responses. (Schofield Decl. ¶6.)
TENTATIVE RULING MOTION 2

Here,
Plaintiff did not serve responses within 30 days of service of the Requests for
Admissions, nor did Plaintiff serve responses by the extended date to respond.
Plaintiff also had not served responses as of the date of Defendant’s counsel’s
declaration on July 31, 2023. Thus, Plaintiff waived objections.
Defendant’s motion for an order deeming the truth of
all matters specified in Requests for Admissions, Set One, is GRANTED if
Defendant can show service of the instant motion. Plaintiff’s objections are
waived. The truth of the matters specified in Requests for Admissions, Set One,
are deemed admitted.
Sanctions

“It
is mandatory that the court impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) on the party or attorney, or both, whose
failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.” (CCP § 2033.280(c).) 
“The court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act
in favor of a party who files a motion to compel discovery, even though no
opposition to the motion was filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn,
or the requested discovery was provided to the moving party after the motion
was filed.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1348(a).) 
Defendant requests sanctions against Plaintiff and her
attorney of record in the amount of $1160.00. Defendant’s counsel, Kylie
Schofield, bases her sanctions request on the following: (1) Three hours
drafting the motion and corresponding declaration; (2) anticipating 1 hour
reviewing opposition and drafting reply briefs; (3) 1 hour attending the
hearing; (4) $60.00 for filing the motion; (5) Billing rate of $220 per hour.
No opposition was filed.
