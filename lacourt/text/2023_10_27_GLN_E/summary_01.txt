And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to set aside default and default judgment filed by the Defendants, Beecan Health CT, LLC, Beecan Health, LLC, and Serrano Post Acute, LLC dba Hollywood Premier Healthcare Center. The motion was denied as moot because the Defendants had previously filed a notice of withdrawal of the motion on October 6, 2023. The notice stated that the Defendants were withdrawing their motion without prejudice, and it was scheduled to be heard on October 27, 2023. Therefore, the Judge did not need to consider the merits of the motion and simply denied it as moot.
