And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to his requests for production (nos. 54 and 55) propounded on the defendant, Tekeyan Cultural Association, Inc. The judge finds that the plaintiff did not substantially identical requests in the past, so the deadline has not passed to compel further production. The judge orders the defendant to provide further production of documents from before 2017, with a privilege log, and to produce documents from 2017 to the present. The judge also finds that the documents may contain privileged material and orders the defendant to provide a privilege log. The judge declines to award sanctions, finding that the defendant had substantial justification for its opposition. The motion is granted, and the parties are ordered to provide further responses/production within 45 days.
