Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Guadalupe Gualotuna, is seeking to enforce a settlement with the defendant, Moores Daycare Inc. The settlement requires the defendant to pay $5,000, which they have failed to do. The plaintiff is also seeking $4,260 in fees and costs. The court has the authority to enter judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. In reviewing the motion to enforce the settlement, the court will determine whether the parties entered into a valid and binding settlement. The court will consider the parties' declarations and other evidence to decide what terms the parties agreed to. If the court determines that the settlement is enforceable, it will grant the motion and enter a formal judgment in accordance with the settlement terms. In this case, the court has determined that a valid settlement exists between the parties and has retained jurisdiction. Therefore, the motion to enforce the settlement is granted.
