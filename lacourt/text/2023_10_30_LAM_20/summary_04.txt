And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a fraudulent transfer action relating to a stipulated judgment in BC457138. The defendant seeks to disqualify the plaintiff's counsel, Kenneth J. Catanzarite, due to a potential conflict of interest. The defendant argues that Catanzarite has all knowledge regarding the underlying action and will be called as a witness, which would violate the witness-advocate rule. The defendant also contends that Catanzarite has been litigating the case for his own interests after the plaintiff, Kosmas Pappas, passed away.

The judge finds that the defendant has not convincingly established a detriment or injury to defeat the informed consent of Tony Protopappas, who has substituted for Pappas. The judge notes that the court's discretion to disqualify an attorney derives from the court's inherent power to control the proceedings and that the purpose of disqualification is not punitive but prophylactic. The judge denies the motion to disqualify counsel.
