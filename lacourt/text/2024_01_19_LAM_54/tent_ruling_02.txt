BACKGROUND
 
This is an employment action. On
October 12, 2021, Plaintiff Heather Reitman filed a complaint against
Defendants Wild Card Media, LLC and 3AM Creative Group, LLC, asserting causes
of action for disability discrimination and Labor Code violations. 
 
On May 31, 2022, the Court granted
Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration. On September 8, 2023, the Court
vacated arbitration on the ground that Defendants failed to timely pay
arbitration fees per CCP § 1281.98.
 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
CCP § 1281.98(c) allows a party to recover
attorney’s fees associated with an abandoned arbitration proceeding after a
successful motion to vacate under Section 1281.98(a).
Plaintiff moves for attorney’s fees in the
amount of $78,000.00 and costs of $1,916.90. Plaintiff’s counsel, Benjamin
Davidson, declares that 151 hours, plus 5 hours to reply and attend the hearing
on this motion, at $500.00 per hour were spent on the abandoned arbitration
proceeding. 
In opposition, Defendants assert counsel’s
hours are improperly block billed, inflated, and include work related to
general litigation. The Court does not take issue with the manner of billing or
the number of hours billed. Similarly, the Court finds the hours requested were
incurred “in association” with the arbitration. Plaintiff seeks fees that were
incurred challenging the arbitration proceeding and participating in it.
Plaintiff does not seek fees for litigation activity that occurred before
Defendants moved to compel arbitration.
Plaintiffs’ motion is GRANTED in full.
