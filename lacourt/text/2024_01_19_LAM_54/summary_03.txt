And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies the motion to consolidate two cases, 23STCV08570 and 23STCV14540, brought by Tracy Hark, Al Waller, and Patrome Collins against Pacific Maritime Association and SSA Terminals, LLC. The plaintiffs argue that the cases involve common questions of law and fact, including incidents of racial harassment by Lomeli, and that consolidation would avoid unnecessary costs and delay. The defendants, however, contend that the actions do not involve common facts and that consolidation would confuse the jury and not result in efficiencies of discovery or at trial. The court declines to consolidate the actions, finding that they involve distinct incidents and employment relationships. The motion to consolidate is therefore denied.
