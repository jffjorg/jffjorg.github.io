And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has sustained Defendants' demurrer to Plaintiff's Complaint without leave to amend. The court finds that the Complaint fails to state a cause of action for unlawful detainer. Specifically, the court finds that the Complaint and Exhibits 1-3 are inconsistent, ambiguous, and uncertain, and therefore fails to state a cause of action. Additionally, the court finds that the Plaintiff's failure to attach correct proofs of service and the notices are not in strict compliance with the statutorily mandated notice requirements. As a result, the court grants Defendants' demurrer without leave to amend.
