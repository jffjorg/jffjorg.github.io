Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge granted the defendants' motion to stay the civil action pending the outcome of the related criminal action. The defendants argued that the civil action is inexorably intertwined with the criminal action and that a temporary stay is necessary to protect their Fifth Amendment rights. The judge found that the defendants' motion was warranted given the significant overlap between the two actions and the potential for the plaintiff to use the discovery process to obtain incriminating testimony from the defendants. The judge continued the defendants' motions to quash the subpoenas for business records issued to Soundhouse and Harbourview to December 18, 2024.
