  Case Number:  22STCV01394    Hearing Date:   April 12, 2024    Dept:  71 SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES  DEPARTMENT 71  TENTATIVE RULING  FIVE POINTS, LP,               vs.  CITY OF IRWINDALE, et al.  Case No.:  22STCV01394      Hearing Date:  April 12, 2024  Defendant City of Irwindale’s motion for attorneys’ fees is granted in the reduced total amount of $316,510.00, comprised of $309,246.10 in attorneys’ fees and $6,533.50 in attorneys’ fees incurred on the instant motion.  Defendant City of Irwindale (“City”) (“Defendant”) moves for an order awarding it attorneys’ fees and costs in the total amount of $399,201.55, comprised of $368,976.50 in attorneys’ fees, an additional $5,000 in anticipated fees on the instant motion, and costs in the amount of $25,225.05 against Plaintiff Five Points, LP (“Five Points”) (“Plaintiff”) as the prevailing party in the instant case.  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§1032(a)(4), (b); §1033.5(a)(10); Civ. Code §1717.)  City moves on the basis (1) this matter was terminated when the Court entered a judgment of dismissal in favor of City, stating City is a prevailing party; and (2) it is entitled to an award of its actual attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to the contractual language in the agreement between the parties at issue in this matter that: “The prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to recover attorneys’ fees and costs from the other party.”  (Notice of Motion, pg. 2.)  Evidentiary Objections City’s 4/5/24 evidentiary objections to the Declaration of Steven S. Davis (“Davis”) is sustained as to Nos. 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20, and overruled as to Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9.   Background On October 28, 2015, Plaintiff’s predecessor in interest entered into an Agreement for Purchase, Sale & Development of Real Property and Joint Escrow Instructions (“PSDA”) with City for the acquisition and development of approximately 25.4 acres of land, located within the City at 5175 Vincent Avenue (“Property”).  (FAC ¶25.)  The parties entered into the PSDA with the ultimate goal of Plaintiff developing a project that would include “light industrial and commercial improvements” on the Property, as set forth in the Scope of Development.  (FAC, Exh. 1, pg. 8, Recital F.)  In 2017, Plaintiff submitted a development application to City to develop a single-story ±545,735 square-foot speculative concrete tilt-up building and associated passenger vehicle and truck parking (“Project”) on the Property.  (FAC ¶¶42, 46.)  City ultimately denied Plaintiff’s application.  (FAC ¶¶62, 63.)   On January 12, 2022, Plaintiff brought the instant action against City, alleging causes of action: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (3) promissory estoppel; (4) declaratory relief; (5) taking of property without just compensation; and (6) civil rights violations of procedural and substantive due process.  (See Complaint.) Thereafter Five Points filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), which removed the 6th cause of action for civil rights violations.  (See FAC.)  Plaintiff alleged that by rejecting the Project, City breached its contractual obligations and harmed Plaintiff because City was contractually obligated to approve the Project in accordance with the PSDA, which governs the development of the Property.  (See FAC.)  On June 27, 2023, this Court sustained City’s demurrer to the 1st through 4th causes of action without leave to amend, and sustained City’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s 5th cause of action for taking of property without just compensation with 20 days’ leave to amend.  (6/27/23 Minute Order.)  Plaintiff was to file an amended pleading on or before July 24, 2023.  Plaintiff failed to file a responsive pleading by July 24, 2023, or at any time thereafter.  On November 8, 2023, this Court entered a judgment of dismissal in favor of the City as the prevailing party.   On January 8, 2024, City filed this motion for attorneys’ fees.  Plaintiff filed its opposition on March 29, 2024.  City filed its reply on April 5, 2024.  Discussion Civil Code §1717(a) provides, in part: In any action on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce the contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to other costs.  (Civ. Code §1717(a).) A party who obtains an “unqualified victory” on a contract dispute is considered the prevailing party for purposes of Civil Code §1717 as a matter of law.  (Hsu v. Abbara (1995) 9 Cal.4th 863, 876-877.)  Additionally, the phrase “prevailing party” is understood to include “[t]he party with a net monetary recovery, a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief, and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.”  (C.C.P. §1032(a)(4).) Here, Section 12.7 of the PSDA provides,  In the event of any dispute between the parties hereto arising out of the subject matter of this Agreement or the Escrow, or in connection with the Site, the prevailing party in such action shall be entitled to have and to recover from the other party its actual attorneys’ fees and other expenses and costs in connection with such action or proceeding (including expert witness fees) in addition to its recoverable court costs.  (Decl. of Guerra ¶3, Exh. A at §12.7.) Section 12.7 unambiguously reflects the Parties’ intent that the prevailing party in a dispute arising out of the “subject matter of this Agreement . . . or in connection with the Site” is entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees and costs.  (Decl. of Guerra ¶3, Exh. A at §12.7.)  All of Plaintiff’s causes of action in this litigation arose out of the subject matter of the PSDA and in connection with the site/Property.  (See FAC.)  Plaintiff’s requested relief included compensatory damages, consequential damages, for a judicial declaration of the rights and duties of the parties with respect to the PSDA, including that City was contractually obligated to approve the Project or else is in breach of the PSDA, and an award of just compensation.  (See FAC Prayer.)  Plaintiff’s causes of action and the requested relief arise out of the subject matter of the Parties’ Agreement, and in connection with the site/Property. Further, under Civil Code §1717, prevailing party means the party in whose favor final judgment is rendered.  (Mabee v. Nurseryland Garden Centers, Inc. (1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 420, 152.)  Final Judgment was entered in favor of City on November 8, 2023.  Section 12.7 of the Agreement authorizes an award of all attorneys’ fees and costs incurred by the City as the prevailing party in this lawsuit. Accordingly, City is the undisputed prevailing party in this action and is entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees.  Reasonable Fees To calculate a lodestar amount, the Court must first determine the reasonableness of the hourly rates sought by Defendant’s counsel. The Supreme Court of California has concluded that a reasonable hourly lodestar rate is the prevailing rate for private attorneys “conducting non-contingent litigation of the same type.”  (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1133, emphasis added.) City’s Counsel declares the following hourly rates for attorneys who worked on this case: (1) Adrian Guerra ($255.00/hour); (2) Anthony Taylor ($255.00/hour); (3) D. Dennis La ($255.00/hour); (4) G. Ross Trindle, III ($255.00/hour); (5) June S. Ailin ($255.00/hour); (6) Jamie L. Traxler ($245.00/hour); (7) Yecenia Vargas ($245.00/hour); (8) Robert M. Hensley ($245.00/hour); (9) John K. Salcedo ($245.00/hour); (10) Shukan A. Patel ($245.00/hour); and (11) Sarah I. Locklin ($245.00/hour).  (Decl. of Guerra ¶10.)  Defendant has sufficiently demonstrated his counsel’s hourly rates are reasonable in their community of practice in their specialized area of law.  (Decl. of Guerra ¶¶6, 8-10, Exhs. B, C.) Plaintiff does not challenge City’s counsel’s hourly rates and thereby concedes City’s counsel’s rates are reasonable.  Billed Hours The party seeking fees and costs bears the burden to show “the fees incurred were allowable, were reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation, and were reasonable in amount.”  (Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.)  In this case, the declarations and billing records provided by City’s counsel are sufficient to meet the burden of proving the reasonableness of the claimed fees in terms of amounts and tasks. To satisfy this burden, evidence and descriptions of billable tasks must be presented in sufficient detail, enabling the court to evaluate whether the case was overstaffed, the time attorneys spent on specific claims, and the reasonableness of the hours expended.  (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 486-487.) City’s counsel does not provide the total number of hours billed to defend City in this matter and instead submits numerous invoices without a total of the hours billed.1  (See Decl. of Guerra ¶¶8-9, Exhs. B, C.)  The Court therefore will total the number of hours billed by City’s counsel, which is calculated to be 1,582.3 hours. Plaintiff objects to City’s hours billed on nine grounds.  First, Plaintiff’s objection to City billing $21,138.50 for its motion to disqualify Plaintiff’s former counsel is not supported by legal argument and does not meet the requisite specificity to challenge City’s fees.  Therefore, Plaintiff failed to meet its burden to challenge City’s fees on its motion to disqualify. Second, Plaintiff’s objection to City’s demurrers to the Complaint and FAC is similarly lacking in legal support and specificity sufficient to challenge City’s fees.  Therefore, Plaintiff failed to meet its burden to challenge City’s fees on its demurrers. Third, Plaintiff’s objection to City’s fees for its withdrawn motion for summary judgment is well taken, as the motion was not filed with or heard by this Court, and therefore was not reasonably incurred.  Accordingly, City’s fees for its motion for summary judgment are reduced by $4,204.45. Fourth, Plaintiff’s objection to City’s withdrawn motion to continue the trial date is well taken, as the motion was not heard by this Court, and therefore was not reasonably incurred.  Accordingly, City’s fees for its motion to continue the trial date is reduced by $13,886.25. Fifth, Plaintiff’s objection to motions to compel discovery that were not filed or heard by this Court are well taken. Accordingly, City’s fees for its motion to continue the trial date is reduced by $1,971.25. Sixth, Plaintiff’s objection to fee requests for “various aspects of discovery” is not supported by legal argument and does not meet the requisite specificity to challenge City’s fees.  Therefore, Plaintiff failed to meet its burden to challenge City’s fees on “various aspects of discovery.” Seventh, Plaintiff’s objection to fee request for time billed that was redacted is well taken, as there is no means of determining what portion of Defendant’s fee request is for these entirely redacted billing entries or assessing the reasonableness of the 67.10 hours billed in partially redacted billing entries.  Accordingly, the Court reduces City’s fees by 67.10 hours x $250/hour (average rate of attorney’s fees), for a total of $16,775.00. Eighth, Plaintiff’s objection to City’s 79 instances of block billing is well taken.  (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1325-1326  [“[W]here vague, block billed time entries inflated with non-compensable hours destroy an attorney’s credibility with the Trial Court, we have no power on appeal to restore it.”]; Marriage of Nassim (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 667, 695  [“[B]lock billing presents a particular problem for a court seeking to allocate between reimbursable and non-reimbursable fees, and Trial Courts are granted discretion to penalize [block billing] when the practice prevents them from discerning which tasks are compensable and which are not.”].)   Accordingly, the Court reduces City’s requested fees by $22,893.50. Accordingly, City’s requested fees are granted in the reduced amount of $309,246.10.  Motion for Attorneys’ Fees City’s counsel requests an additional $5,000 in anticipated fees to analyze Plaintiff’s opposition, prepare a reply, and attend the hearing on the instant motion.  City’s counsel declares it has billed 26.5 hours on the instant motion, not including anticipated fees, for a total of $6,533.50.  (Supp.-Decl. of Guerra ¶7.)  Anticipated fees are not fees reasonably incurred, and accordingly, the Court will not grant the anticipated three additional hours requested.  Accordingly, the Court grants City only the $6,533.50 in fees incurred on the instant motion.  Costs Any effort to tax or strike costs must occur in the form of a motion to strike or to tax costs and must be served and filed fifteen (15) days after service of the cost memorandum.  (CRC, Rule 3.1700(b)(1).)  After the 15-day deadline to file a motion to tax costs has passed, the Court clerk must immediately enter the costs. (CRC, Rule 3.1700(b)(4).) On November 17, 2023, City submitted a memorandum of costs for the total amount of $2,324.94.  (11/17/23 Memorandum of Costs.)   City now requests an additional $25,225.05 in costs not explicitly requested in City’s argument and noted in the Declaration of Guerra for items such as hard drives, copies, parking, and postage.  (Decl. of Guerra ¶13.)  These costs should have been included in City’s memorandum of costs, and City provides no explanation for why such costs were omitted from its memorandum of costs. Accordingly, City’s request for costs separate from those requested in City’s memorandum of costs filed on November 17, 2023, is denied.  Conclusion Accordingly, City’s motion for attorneys’ fees is granted in the reduced total amount of $316,510.00, comprised of $309,246.10 in attorneys’ fees and $6,533.50 in fees incurred on the instant motion.   Moving Party to give notice.    Dated:  April _____, 2024      Hon.
