English-text summary:

In this tentative ruling, the judge considers a demurrer and motion to strike filed by the defendants in response to a complaint filed by the plaintiff, Bonnie Bull. The complaint alleges that the defendants, including Michael Donnelly, failed to recover funds that were deposited in a joint checking account during a divorce proceeding. The judge sustains the demurrer as to the cause of action for professional malpractice, overrules the demurrer as to the causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and elder financial abuse, and grants the motion to strike the prayer for attorney's fees and punitive damages. The judge finds that the defendants' conduct does not rise to the level of malice or despicable conduct required to support a demand for punitive damages.
