And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendants, David C. Smith and Third Law Productions, LLC, have moved to compel arbitration of the remaining causes of action alleged in the first amended complaint. The settlement agreement signed by M. Shawn Lawler, David C. Smith, and DrivingPlates.com, LLC in 2021 allocates intellectual property to DrivingPlates.com, LLC and includes an arbitration provision for disputes arising from the agreement. The court finds that the arbitration agreement applies to the first four causes of action (unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, conversion, and civil theft) and the fifth cause of action (trade libel) because it involves a non-disparagement clause. The court also finds that the arbitration agreement is enforceable against non-signatory plaintiff DrivingPlates.com, LLC under the doctrine of equitable estoppel and against non-signatory defendant Third Law CA under the doctrine of equitable estoppel.

The court grants the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and orders the plaintiffs to arbitrate all remaining causes of action. The court also stays the entire action pending resolution of the arbitration proceeding.
