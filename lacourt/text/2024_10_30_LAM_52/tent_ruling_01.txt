  Case Number:  21STCV04357    Hearing Date:   October 30, 2024    Dept:  52 Tentative Ruling: 
Plaintiff
George Smith’s Motion to Continue Trial
Plaintiff
George Smith moves to continue the trial, which is set for November 13, 2024.  Plaintiff shows good cause to continue the
trial due to counsel’s illness.  (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c)(3).) 
Plaintiff’s counsel had an implantable defibrillator/pacemaker implanted
on August 29, 2024.  (Collins Decl., ¶
8.)  Counsel submitted a note dated
October 10, 2024, from his doctor stating he cannot participate in “any trials
for the next 70 days as he is still under going treatment.”  (Id., ¶ 9, Ex. A.)  The sole remaining defendant, Bryan D.
Hubbard, M.D. did not oppose this motion. 
The court will exercise its discretion to continue the trial.
The
court notes that on July 24, 2024, the court continued the trial due to
plaintiff’s counsel’s back pain.
Plaintiff
George Smith’s motion to continue trial is granted.  
The
court hereby continues the jury trial set for November 13, 2024, to
January 28, 2025, at 10:00 a.m.  The new
trial date if firm and certain.  
The
joint trial documents required by the July 6, 2023, trial preparation order
shall be filed no later than January 6, 2025. 
At the February 7, 2024, final status conference, the court reviewed the
deficiencies in the joint trial documents and ordered the parties to file
updated joint trial documents.  At the
July 11, 2024, final status conference, the court noted that the parties failed
to submit updated joint trial documents and again advised the parties they were
not prepared for trial.  The court also
issued an order to show cause (OSC) re sanctions for failure to comply with the
trial preparation order.  At the October
30, 2024, final status conference, the court again noted that the parties have
failed to submit joint trial documents in compliance with the trial preparation
order.  The OSC re sanctions is continued
to January 14, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.
The
court hereby continues the final status conference from this date to January
14, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.  Lead trial
counsel must appear in person at the final status conference.  No remote appearances are permitted.  Lead counsel for both parties shall be
prepared to remain in court for the remainder of the day, if necessary, to
finalize joint trial documents.
The
court does not continue any pretrial deadlines, including the deadlines set
forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.020.
