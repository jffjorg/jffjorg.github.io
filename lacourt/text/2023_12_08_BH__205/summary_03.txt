And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled on Defendant David Kamen's demurrer and motion to strike the third and fourth causes of action in the complaint. The court has overruled the demurrer and denied the motion to strike. The third cause of action is for assault and battery, and the court has found that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts to support a claim of medical battery. The fourth cause of action is for intentional infliction of emotional distress, and the court has found that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts to support a claim of extreme and outrageous conduct. The court has denied the motion to strike the claims and has allowed the case to proceed.
