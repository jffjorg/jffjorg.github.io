Summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a plaintiff's motion to set aside a dismissal of her complaint. The plaintiff, Mane Karapetian, fell on a liquid spill at the Griffin Club Los Angeles and alleges severe injuries. The complaint was dismissed for failure to serve defendants within 60 days. The plaintiff's attorney claims neglect in serving defendants due to ongoing settlement negotiations. The court denies the motion to vacate the dismissal, finding that mandatory relief is not available because the dismissal was for failure to prosecute, and discretionary relief is not available because the attorney's neglect was not excusable.
