 Case Number:  24LBCV01406    Hearing Date:   December 19, 2024    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundOn July 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants America Honda Motor, Co., Inc. and Does 1 to 50, alleging five causes of action: (1) Violation of Civil Code Section 1793.2(d); (2) Violation of Civil Code Section 1793.2(b); (3) Violation of Civil Code Section 1793.2(a)(3); (4) Breach of the Implied Warranty of Merchantability; (5) Fraudulent Inducement – Concealment. The complaint asserts that on September 11, 2022, Plaintiff entered into a warranty contract with Defendant, regarding a 2021 Honda Passport vehicle identification number 5FNYF7H56MB000408 (“Subject Vehicle”) and that defects and/or nonconformities to the warranty manifested themselves in the vehicle, but Defendant failed to fix them. (Compl., ¶¶ 6-12, 14, 15.)On November 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to compel further responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One. On December 6, 2024, Defendant filed an opposition. On December 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply. Plaintiff seeks to compel further responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. 1-3, 7, 9, 14-20, 29, 30, 39, 40, 43, 44, 47, 48, 53, 54, 55, 56, 69-74, 83-86, 89, 92, 93, 104, 107, 108, 110, 114, 115, 120, 121, 126, 127, 135, 136, 139, 140, and 142-145 (the “Requests” or “RFPs”).Meet and ConferAs evidenced in counsel’s attached declarations, these law firms are engaged in multiple discovery exchanges involving various other plaintiffs. Based upon the declaration as well as the number of requests for further production in an arguably straight forward Song -Beverly matter, the Court believes the parties have not sufficiently had a meaningfully met and confer conversation. In fact, it is unclear if counsel have ever directly spoken to each other or if the “meet and confer” effort is just an exchange of emails.On the Court’s own motion, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses is continued to January 29, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. for counsel to engage in a more meaningful and productive meet and confer process. For guidance, below are some basic parameters for what the court typically orders with respect to these types of discovery disputes. Typically, the court orders and limits production of documents including ESI in a Song-Beverly single-vehicle case as follows:1. Purchase and/or lease contract concerning the subject vehicle must be produced.2. Repair orders and invoices concerning the subject vehicle must be produced, including the “accounting” copies showing the hours and dates of activity by dealer personnel.3. Communications between the plaintiff and the warrantor/manufacturer and/or its servicing dealers, and communications between Plaintiff and the manufacturer’s factory representative and/or call center concerning the subject vehicle.4. Warranty claims submitted to and/or approved by Defendant concerning the subject vehicle.5. The applicable Warranty Policy and Procedure Manual published by defendant and provided to its authorized repair facilities, within the State of California, for the year the lawsuit was filed. If a separate written policy, procedure, or manual exists regarding repurchases or buy backs applicable to vehicles sold or leased in California, that would also be required to be produced for the year the lawsuit was filed and/or the year Plaintiff contends the vehicle became qualified for repurchase (such as upon satisfaction of the Presentation Element of a Song-Beverly cause of action under Section 1793.2(d)(2) or 1793.22). Such documents would be produced subject to a protective order.6. Any internal analysis and/or investigation regarding the primary or other recurring alleged defects claimed by plaintiff in her/his vehicle, applicable to the same year, make and model of the subject vehicle. The Court tends to focus on the claimed symptom experienced by the plaintiff as described in the dealers’ repair records, rather than a broad and vague characterization of the claimed defect as described by counsel in the litigation. For example, if the customer experienced a black Infotainment screen when shifting in reverse, or a harsh engagement or clunk of the transmission when accelerating from 2nd to 3rd gear, those symptoms rather than any other nature of malfunction of the Infotainment system or transmission would be the narrowing of scope of such internal analysis or investigation to be produced. In this case, there appears to be no allegations of defects related to the “Sensing” system of the subject vehicle. However, delay in subject vehicle may fall under a narrow definition if “Engine Concern.”7. Other customers’ complaints similar to the alleged defects (e.g. static when on Bluetooth, intermittent delay at start up and car not always starting/delay in starting) claimed by plaintiff, limited to vehicles purchased in California for the same year, make and model of the subject vehicle. The other customer complaints again would be limited in scope to the description of the symptom as shown on the dealer repair records. The Court typically discusses with counsel the type of documents that may be required and the format for a production of documents such as in a sortable Excel spreadsheet that lists a compilation or summary of voluminous documents.8. Technical Service Bulletins and/or Recall Notices for vehicles purchased in California for the same year, make and model of the subject vehicle, whether mentioned in the repair history of the subject vehicle or not.9. Requests for documents and deposition testimony in other lawsuits is not relevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Further, such evidence may be subject to a protective order.Using these guidelines, the parties are ordered to discuss these discovery issues with a meaningfully “meet and confer” by January 3, 2025. A joint status report setting forth any remaining discovery disputes should be submitted by the parties by January 17, 2025. On the Court’s own motion, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses is continued to January 29, 2025 at 8:30 a.m.Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.
