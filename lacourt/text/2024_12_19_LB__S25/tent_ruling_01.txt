  Case Number:  23LBCV01169    Hearing Date:   December 19, 2024    Dept:  S25 Motion:  Defendants Uber Technologies, Inc. and Portier, LLC’s Motion to Strike Portions of Plaintiff’s First Amended ComplaintProcedural BackgroundOn June 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Uber Technologies, Inc., Portier, LLC, Joseph Gallegos and Does 1 to 50. Plaintiff alleges that the action arises from an automobile collision that occurred on or about May 14, 2023, on Pacific Coast Highway, at or near Redondo Avenue, in the City of Long Beach (“Incident”). (Compl., ¶ 1.) On October 12, 2023, Defendants Uber Technologies, Inc. and Portier, LLC (“Uber Defendants” or “Defendants”) filed an answer. On April 22, 2024, the Court granted the parties stipulation, continuing the final status conference to October 4, 2024, the trial date to October 14, 2024, and all discovery and other pre-trial deadlines to be based from the new trial date. (April 22, 2024 Order.) On May 23, 2024, Defendant Joseph Gallegos (“Defendant Gallegos”) filed an answer. On August 29, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for leave to file a first amended complaint (“FAC”), with the FAC deemed filed as of August 29, 2024. (August 29, 2024 Minute Order.)On September 30, 2024, Defendants filed the instant motion to strike. On December 3, 2024, the Court continued Defendants’ motion to continue trial hearing to December 19, 2024. (December 3, 2024 Minute Order.) On December 6, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On December 12, 2024, Defendants filed a reply.Legal StandardA party may move to strike matters from an opposing party’s pleading if it is irrelevant, false or improper. (See Code Civ. Proc. §§ 435, 436, subd. (a).) Motion to strike may also target all or any part of pleadings not filed or drawn in conformity with the applicable laws, rules or orders. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (b).) A Motion to Strike is the proper procedure for testing the adequacy of a punitive damages allegation because punitive damages are not a cause of action. (Grieves v. Superior Ct. (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 164.)To obtain punitive damages in an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract, a plaintiff must demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the defendant is guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a).) The clear and convincing evidence standard “requires a finding of high probability . . . ‘so clear as to leave no substantial doubt’; sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.” (Lackner v. North (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1188, 1211.)“Oppression” is defined as “despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.” (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(2).) "[D]espicable” connotes conduct that is ". . . so vile, base, contemptible, miserable, wretched or loathsome that it would be looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent people.” (Lackner, supra, 135 Cal.App.4th at p. 1210.) “Fraud” is defined as “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.” (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(3).) “Malice” is defined as “conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(1).) “Not only must there by circumstances of oppression, fraud or malice, but facts must be alleged in the pleading to support such a claim.” (Grieves, supra, 157 Cal.App.3d at p. 166.)Meet and ConferThe requirements are satisfied. (Loayza Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. C; Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd. (a)(2) & (3).)Parties’ ArgumentsDefendants move to strike the following portion of the FAC: Page 8, Prayer for Damages.First, Defendants argue Plaintiff’s request for punitive damages does not contain specific allegations supporting a conclusion that Defendants acted with oppression, fraud, malice. Defendants point to Plaintiff’s conclusory allegation that the “Uber Defendants knew or should have known, of Defendant GALLEGOS’ unfitness to drive” and that no other specific facts are offered by Plaintiff. Also, Defendants distinguish the present matter from Taylor v. Superior Court (1979) 24 Cal.3d 890 in that here, the FAC lacks facts to support a finding of malicious or oppressive conduct against Defendants, while in Taylor, supra, 24 Cal.3d at pp. 892, 895-896, the Supreme Court found that plaintiff’s factual assertions that the defendant knew he was an alcoholic for a substantial period of time as well his dangerous tendency to drive while intoxicated supported an imposition of punitive damages.Next, Defendants contend that Plaintiff’s punitive damage allegation should be stricken because Plaintiff does not allege involvement of any officer, director, or managing agent of Defendants. (See Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (b); Cruz v. HomeBase (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 160, 167 [“the punitive damage statute requires proof of malice among corporate leaders: the ‘officers, directors, or managing agents”].)In opposition, Plaintiff argues that Defendants are purposefully withholding evidence by refusing to respond to certain discovery requests issued by Plaintiff. In the event the Court grants the instant motion, Plaintiff requests the Court to permit Plaintiff to further amend her operative complaint and permit Plaintiff time to amend the complaint to 30 days after Defendants produce the discovery currently in dispute.In reply, Defendants reassert their earlier arguments. Defendants analogize the instant matter to Herrick v. Superior Court (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 787, 788-789 wherein the Court granted defendant’s motion to strike plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages as the defendant driver failed to stop for a posted stop sign while driving under the influence. Defendants add that Plaintiff’s social media posts two months after the incident show her enjoying life and in no pain or discomfort as she attends Taylor Swift concerts internationally. (Loayza Decl., ¶ 4.) Defendants also counter that Plaintiff’s argument that the parties are engaged in a discovery dispute does not remedy the deficiencies in the FAC, further stating that the discovery Plaintiff seeks are confidential documents that do not support a claim for punitive damages. Defendants further state that they will suffer undue prejudice if Plaintiff is granted to leave to amend her complaint at this stage with the trial date currently set for January 28, 2025.Tentative RulingHere, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not pleaded sufficient facts to warrant punitive damages. Plaintiff has failed to allege facts that rise to the level of malice, fraud, or oppression. Plaintiff fails to allege any specific facts supporting Defendant's advance knowledge of the Defendant Gallegos’ unfitness. Likewise, Plaintiff does not allege that an officer, director, or managing agent of Defendants had such advance knowledge. Accordingly, the instant motion to strike is GRANTED and Page 8, Prayer for Damages: 3. For punitive damages” is stricken.If information is subsequently obtained in discovery that may support Defendant's advance knowledge of the Defendant Gallegos’ unfitness, Plaintiff can seek leave to amend.Motion: Defendant Joseph Gallegos’ Motion to Strike Portions of Plaintiff’s First Amended ComplaintProcedural BackgroundOn June 23, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants Uber Technologies, Inc., Portier, LLC, Joseph Gallegos and Does 1 to 50.

Defendant Gallegos distinguishes the present matter from Taylor v.

Plaintiff has failed to allege facts that rise to the level of malice, fraud, or oppression. Furthermore, Plaintiff has not added new allegations to the FAC that sufficiently demonstrate Defendant Gallegos’ conduct was malicious, fraudulent or oppressive. Accordingly, the instant motion to strike is GRANTED and Page 8, Prayer for Damages: 3. For punitive damages” is stricken.If information is subsequently obtained in discovery that may support that Defendant Gallegos acted with oppression, fraud, malice, Plaintiff can seek leave to amend.
