Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting United Therapy Network's (UTN) motion for summary judgment in this professional negligence case. The plaintiff, Evelia Brenes, received physical therapy treatments from UTN in January 2022 for recovery from a recent knee surgery, but alleges that UTN's physical therapist failed to use the appropriate standard of care in administering treatment. The plaintiff filed a complaint against UTN and Does 1-50, and UTN moved for summary judgment. The Court found that UTN is entitled to summary judgment on the issue of causation, as the plaintiff failed to establish that UTN's breach of the standard of care caused the plaintiff's injuries to a reasonable degree of medical probability. The Court also found that the plaintiff's expert, Philip Lim, failed to establish a causal connection between UTN's actions and the injuries alleged in the complaint, and that the plaintiff's conclusory opinion was insufficient to establish a causal connection. Therefore, the Court granted UTN's motion for summary judgment.
