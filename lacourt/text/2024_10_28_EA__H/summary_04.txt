The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiffs' application for default judgment without prejudice.

The Court is also requesting that the Plaintiffs attach a copy of the traffic collision report to any future default prove-up application, assuming one exists. The Court is directing the Plaintiffs to submit a revised default judgment application addressing the aforementioned issues.
