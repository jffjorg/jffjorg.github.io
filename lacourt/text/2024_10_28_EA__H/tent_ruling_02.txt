   [FN1] The Court grants UTN’s request to take judicial notice of the  dictionary definition of “diagnosis,” pursuant to Evidence Code section 452,  subdivision (h). As to UTN’s objection to Dr. Lim as an expert on  medical causation, the Court acknowledges that physical therapists are not  licensed physicians who may render medical diagnoses. (Cal. Bus. & Prof.  Code section 2052(a).) Even so, the Court need  not decide whether Dr. Lim is qualified to opine as to medical causation,  because, as explained in more detail below, his proffered opinion fails to  establish that the massage gun (as opposed to Plaintiff’s underlying medical  condition) caused Plaintiff’s injuries. UTN’s evidentiary objections are otherwise  overruled.    [FN2] Dr. Lim’s opinion that the use  of the massage gun led Plaintiff to experience pain is not in conflict with Dr.  Miller’s opinion. Dr. Miller acknowledges that the use of the massage gun may have been painful but  posits that the reason for the pain was “the postoperative induced peripheral  inflammatory changes in the knee and developing neuropathic pain condition.”  (MSJ, Ex. 3, ¶ 41.)
