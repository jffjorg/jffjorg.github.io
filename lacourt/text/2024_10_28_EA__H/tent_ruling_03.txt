 Case Number:  24PSCV00336    Hearing Date:   October 28, 2024    Dept:  H 140 North Orange Investors, LLC v.
Baldwin Sun, Inc.,
Case No. 24PSCV00336
 
Counsel for Defendant Baldwin Sun,
Inc.’s (i.e., David D. Fu) Motion to be 
Relieved as Counsel is DENIED. 
 
Background 
This is an unlawful detainer action involving the
commercial premises located at 140 N. Orange Avenue in the City of Industry. 
On January 31, 2024, Plaintiff 140 North Orange
Investors, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint for Unlawful Detainer against
Baldwin Sun, Inc. (“Defendant”) and Does 1-10. 
On May 13, 2024, “Judgment Pursuant to Stipulation
for Judgment for Possession of Real Property” was entered. 
A Case Management Conference and an Order to Show
Cause Re: Why Sanctions Should Not Be Imposed for Defense Counsel’s Failure to
Appear on September 11, 2024 are set for October 28, 2024. Pending before the
Court is David D. Fu’s motion to be relieved as counsel of record for
Defendant.
 
Discussion
David
D. Fu seeks to be relieved as
counsel of record for Defendant Baldwin Sun, Inc. (the “Client”).The
motion was filed on September 20, 2024 (electronically served September 18,
2024) and originally set for hearing on October 17, 2024; the Client is not
listed on the accompanying proof of service. Per California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1300(c), “[p]roof of service of the moving papers must be filed no later
than five court days before the time appointed for the hearing.” To date, moving counsel
has not filed a proof of service reflecting that the Client was served with the motion. On September 25,
2024, the Court issued a “Notice Re: Continuance of Hearing and Order,” wherein
the October 17, 2024 scheduled hearing was continued to October 28, 2024;
notice was given to Plaintiff’s counsel only. There is no indication on the
docket that Plaintiff provided notice of the new October 28, 2024 hearing date or
that moving counsel provided notice of the new date to the Client.
Accordingly, the motion is summarily denied, based
on these notice deficiencies.
