ORDER
ON DEFAULT JUDGMENT APPLICATION 
Plaintiffs Alex Guerrero’s and
Sanjuana Renteria’s Application for Default Judgment is DENIED without
prejudice.
Background
Plaintiffs Alex Guerrero and Sanjuana
Renteria (together, “Plaintiffs”) allege that they sustained injuries and
damages in a November 22, 2022 motor vehicle accident. On March 12, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed a complaint, asserting a negligence cause of action against Stephanie
Gonzalez (“Defendant”) and Does 1-25.On
August 16, 2024, the Clerk entered default against Defendant.A
Case Management Conference is set for October 28, 2024. Pending before the
Court is Plaintiffs’ Application for Default Judgment.
 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s
Application for Default Judgment is denied without prejudice. The
following defects are noted: 
1.       In
personal injury and wrongful death actions, the complaint must not state the
amount of damages sought. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.10.) Before a default may be
entered, Plaintiffs must serve Defendant with a statement of “the nature and
amount of damages being sought.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.11.) The proof of
service filed with the Court on June 28, 2024 reflects that Defendant was, in
fact, served with two Statements of Damages; however, the Court has not been
provided with copies of the Statements of Damages or with any information as to
the amounts listed therein. It is unclear to the Court whether or not Defendant
has been provided “actual notice of the liability to which he or she may be
subjected.” (Schwab v. Rondel Homes, Inc. (1991) 53 Cal.3d 428, 435.)
2.       The
Court requests that Plaintiffs attach a copy of the traffic collision report
to any future default prove-up application, assuming one exists.Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiffs’
application without prejudice and directs Plaintiffs to submit a revised
default judgment application addressing the aforementioned issues.
