And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the case. UTN's request to take judicial notice of the dictionary definition of "diagnosis" has been granted. The judge also considered UTN's objection to Dr. Lim's qualifications as an expert on medical causation, but ultimately ruled that it is not necessary to decide whether Dr. Lim is qualified because his opinion fails to establish a causal link between the massage gun and the plaintiff's injuries. The judge also noted that Dr. Lim's opinion is not in conflict with Dr. Miller's opinion, which posits that the pain experienced by the plaintiff was due to an underlying medical condition.
