And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied David D. Fu's motion to be relieved as counsel for the defendant, Baldwin Sun, Inc. The motion was filed on September 20, 2024, and was originally set for hearing on October 17, 2024. However, the notice of the hearing was only given to the plaintiff's counsel, and there is no indication that the client was served with the motion. Furthermore, the proof of service was not filed with the court, as required by California Rules of Court. The judge has therefore denied the motion summarily based on these notice deficiencies.
