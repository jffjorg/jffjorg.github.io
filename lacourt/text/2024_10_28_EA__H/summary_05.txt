Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, OC Auto Exchange dba LA Auto Exchange, has moved to compel arbitration in this case. The court has determined that the defendant has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that a valid arbitration agreement exists between the parties. The agreement, which was entered into on or about September 18, 2022, includes an arbitration provision that states that any claim or dispute arising out of or relating to the purchase or condition of the vehicle shall be resolved by neutral binding arbitration.

The court has granted the defendant's motion to compel arbitration and has stayed the instant case pending completion of the arbitration. The plaintiff, Randy Rosales, has claimed that he did not sign an arbitration agreement, but the court has determined that this claim is not supported by a declaration and that the defendant has proven the existence of the agreement.

The court has also determined that the plaintiff is not entitled to elect his choice of arbitrator, as the arbitration provision permits the parties to agree on a non-AAA arbitrator subject to the approval of the defendant. The court has noted that the parties have "clearly and unmistakably" delegated issues of arbitrability to the arbitrator, and therefore the arbitrator, not the court, will decide such issues as the scope of the arbitration agreement.
