  Case Number:  20STCV34404    Hearing Date:   July 9, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Motion of The Gorman Group, Inc. to be Relieved as Counsel-Civil.
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs filed a Complaint alleging that this action
arises out of Defendants’ fraudulent scheme to deprive Plaintiffs of over six
million dollars, by way of Defendant LIZHI and Defendant BAI’S positions of
trust as sole operators of Plaintiff NING’S business, 4WD, while Plaintiff resided
outside of the country.
Now, counsel moves to be relieved as attorney of
record for Plaintiffs by declaring that they have not cooperated or paid expenses
for trial preparation and expert witnesses.
LEGAL STANDARD
“The determination whether to grant or deny an
attorney 's motion to withdraw as counsel of record lies within the sound
discretion of the trial court, having in mind whether such withdrawal might
work an injustice in the handling of the case.” Lempert v. Superior
Court (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173. 
 
ANALYSIS
Here, the form notice, proposed form order, and proof
of service, sufficiently comply with the requirements for a motion to be
relieved as counsel. See Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362. 
While counsel’s declaration and the proposed order are
not on the official forms, the Court has discretion to accept the customized
declaration and to instruct counsel to submit a proposed order on the Judicial
Council form. Courts may overlook harmless procedural errors made in documents
or proceedings that do not affect substantial rights of parties. Code Civ.
Proc., § 475; Morgan v. AT & T Wireless Services, Inc. (2009) 177
Cal.App.4th 1235, 1252
Substantively, moving counsel’s declaration shows
cognizable grounds for withdrawal: 

Client
     by conduct renders it unreasonably difficult for the member to carry out
     the employment effectively (e.g., noncooperation or
     noncommunication). Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1.16(b)(4). Cf. Estate of Falco v. Decker,
     supra, 188 Cal App.3d p. 1020 (“We find no abuse of discretion in
     the trial court's implicit finding rejecting the contention that
     respondents' lack of cooperation justified appellants' withdrawal.”).
Client
     breaches an agreement or obligation to the member as to expenses or fees.
     Rules Prof. Conduct, rule 1.16; Lempert v. Sup. Ct. (2003) 112
     Cal.App.4th 1161, 1173.

Finally, the client has filed no opposing document in
order to show prejudice caused by attorney withdrawal. See Rules Prof. Conduct,
rule 1.16, subdiv. (d). 
 
CONCLUSION
Therefore, the Court grants the motion, and will sign an
official form order submitted by counsel.
