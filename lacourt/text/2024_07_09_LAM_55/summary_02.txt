```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint filed by El Adobe Apts., Inc. (Plaintiff) against The San Gabriel Valley Council of Governments (Defendant). The demurrer argues that the Plaintiff's claims for specific performance, quiet title, and declaratory relief are moot because Defendant has already conveyed the relevant parcels to El Adobe. Additionally, the Plaintiff failed to attach exhibits A and B, verify the pleading for quiet title, and comply with the Government Claims Act. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's failure to present an opposition to the demurrer creates a waiver of the issues on appeal. The tentative ruling denies the Plaintiff's request for leave to amend and orders the demurrer sustained without leave to amend.
