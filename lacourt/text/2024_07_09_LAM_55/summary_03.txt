And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the plaintiff's motion to enforce a Section 998 offer made by the defendants. The offer was made in exchange for the plaintiff's execution and transmission of a release of all current claims in the underlying litigation. However, the parties have been unable to agree on the terms of the release, and the judge finds that they have not settled their case. The judge previously found that the parties did not settle and set the case for trial, and the parties have not raised any objections to this decision. The judge also notes that the parties have not agreed on the scope of the release or attorneys' fees, which means that the accepted offer lacks all the content needed to form a final judgment.
