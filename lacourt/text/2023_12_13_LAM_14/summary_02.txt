And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 22STCV30035. The Plaintiff's counsel has failed to respond to an Order to Show Cause (OSC) regarding sanctions, and has not taken any action to assert certain causes of action against Defendants Fede and Figueroa. The Judge finds that the Plaintiff's complaint does not support the direct assertion of those causes of action, and that there is no indication that the Plaintiff will ever proceed against Defendant Vogel. Therefore, the Judge orders the dismissal of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and tenth causes of action against Fede and Figueroa, and orders the Plaintiff to file a First Amended Complaint within 30 days. The Judge also orders the Plaintiff to pay $500 to each of Fede and Figueroa within 30 days, as monetary sanctions to compensate them for their expenses in responding to the dismissed claims. Additionally, the Judge dismisses the case against Defendant Vogel for lack of prosecution, and sets an OSC re: Dismissal of Entire Case for Lack of Prosecution for January 24, 2023.
