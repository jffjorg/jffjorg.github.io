And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the defendants. The defendants had moved the court to prevent Alex Galindo from prosecuting a PAGA action currently pending in arbitration, to prevent Mr. Galindo or his counsel from seeking any determinations from the arbitrator in that proceeding, and to consolidate this lawsuit with that arbitration. The judge denied the motion, holding that the court has no legal basis to interrupt the arbitration proceeding.

The judge also granted the motion for attorney's fees and costs filed by Plaintiff Guffey, awarding him $154,636.62 against the defendants. The judge found that the defendants were the ones who wanted to go to arbitration and must bear the consequences of their decision.

Finally, the judge deemed the case complex and ordered a case management conference. The case will be continued to February 6, 2024, at 8:30 am, and the parties are ordered to meet and confer regarding a case management order.
