And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the petition for coordination of eight cases related to alleged exposure to heavy metals in baby food. The cases involve similar products and allegations, and the Judge finds that coordination would promote the ends of justice. The Judge recommends the Los Angeles Superior Court as the site for the coordination proceedings and the Second District Court of Appeal as the reviewing appellate court. The Judge also finds that Landon R. should be included in the coordination, despite the contention that it is a preference case. The Judge will make a final decision on N.C. at the hearing.
