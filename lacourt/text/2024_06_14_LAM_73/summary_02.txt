And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge grants the plaintiff's application for an order requiring the defendants to appear for examination and enforcement of judgment. The plaintiff alleges causes of action against the defendants, including breach of contract, fraud, and negligent misrepresentation. The defendants failed to repair the work performed, and the plaintiff seeks enforcement of the judgment. The plaintiff has not caused the defendants to be examined within the last 120 days, so the court grants the application. The plaintiff shall file proof of service no less than 72 hours in advance of the next hearing.
