Introduction 
Defendants Lincoln D. Bandlow
(Bandlow) and Law Offices of Lincoln Bandlow, P.C. (Law Office) (collectively,
Defendants) specially moved to strike Plaintiffs Reuven Justin Cypers (Cypers)
and Residual Income Opportunities, Inc.’s (RIO) (collectively, Plaintiffs)
Complaint.
Plaintiffs’ opposition requested
$4,800 in attorneys’ fees and costs.  
Procedure 
The parties argued over whether
the motion was timely filed or not.  At
the April 17, 2024 hearing on Co-Defendants Stephen T. Holzer and Lewitt,
Hackman, Shapiro, Marshall & Harlan’s Special Motion to Strike, the Court
recalls setting the deadline for Defendants’ Special Motion to Strike to May 6,
2024.  The Court’s recollection is
further supported by Defendants’ submission of the transcripts from the
hearing.  (Pierre Pine Decl. par. 9, Exh.
L.)  Defendants’ special motion to strike
is timely filed on May 6, 2024.
Discussion 
The Complaint alleged a single
cause of action (COA) for malicious prosecution grounded on the filing and
prosecution of Joseph R. Granatelli v. Reuven Justin Cypers et al. (Super. Ct.
Los Angeles County, 2022, No. LC106344) (Underlying Action). (See Compl. par.
74.)  The Underlying Action was a
shareholder’s derivative action. 
Plaintiffs submitted that malicious prosecution satisfies the first
prong of the Anti-SLAPP standard. (Citizens of Humanity, LLC v. Ramirez (2021)
63 Cal.App.5th 117, 127.) The Court focuses on Plaintiffs’ burden on the second
prong – probability of prevailing on the merits. Plaintiffs must present
admissible evidence that Defendants (1) commenced/prosecuted the prior action;
(2) termination in Plaintiffs’ favor; (3) lack of probable cause; and (4)
malice. (Marijanovic v. Gray, York & Duffy (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 1262,
1270-1271.)
As to the elements of
commencement/prosecution of the Underlying Action and lack of probable cause,
evidence presented by both sides provided facts to show that Defendants
continued to prosecute the Underlying Action. 
Defendants substituted into the Underlying Action on February 22, 2018
and continued to represent Joseph Granatelli (Granatelli) until the demurrer in
the Underlying Action was sustained without leave to amend/dismissed on
September 29, 2020 and/or the Underlying Action was settled on December 17,
2021 and ultimately dismissed on March 11, 2022.  (Lincoln Bandlow Decl. pars. 25, 42, 55, 56,
and Exh. I and Request for Judicial Notice (RJN) Exhs. 13, 14, 32, 44, and
45.)  The evidence showed that Granatelli
plead “no contest” on January 18, 2019 to a criminal charge of felony identity
theft in violation of Penal Code section 530.5 in connection with Cypers’
forged signature on the putative contract and was ordered to pay restitution to
Cypers.  (Bandlow Decl. par. 33; Kenneth
Catanzarite (Catanzarite) Decl. par. 9, Exh. 56.)  Plaintiffs further re-served on October 2,
2019 their evidence that the putative contract was a forgery.  (Bandlow Decl. Exhs. 22 and 23.)  Despite Defendants possession of the
foregoing evidence, Defendants filed their First Amended Complaint (FAC) in the
Underlying Action on December 20, 2019 (Bandlow Decl. par. 41, RJN Exh. 31) and
defended against the demurrer (Bandlow Decl. pars. 42, 44-46, RJN Exhs. 32, 34,
and 37), and appealing the demurrer ruling (Bandlow Decl. par. 47, RJN Exh.
38).  Because Granatelli admitting to
forging the putative contract in the criminal proceeding and was in possession
of Plaintiffs’ evidence showing a forgery, Plaintiffs met their burden to show
that Defendants continued to prosecute the Underlying Action without probable
cause.
Defendants argued that they had
probable cause to continue the Underlying Action based upon Granatelli’s
claims/assertions; Defendants’ independently gathered corroborating evidence
(RJN Exh. 7 (and Exhs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, thereto); e-mail communications
and other filed documents (Bandlow Decl. pars. 31-32, Exhs. C and D; RJN Exhs.
6 and 8 (and Exh. F, thereto) Cypers’ criminal history of fraud and related
crimes (Bandlow Decl. pars. 131(a)-(b), Exhs. F and G); and the Court’s
December 13, 2019 ruling on the motion for sanctions and the Court’s September
14, 2021 granting of Co-Defendants Fox Rothschild, LLP and Conrad Wilton's
(collectively, Fox) Anti-SLAPP motion, which allowed the Underlying Action to
proceed (RJN Exh. 29 and 49).  However,
these facts to support Defendants’ claim that probable cause existed is
insufficient to allow the Court to rule conclusively as a matter of law that
Defendants had probable cause to continue the prosecution of the Underlying
Action.  For purposes of ruling on anti-SLAPP
motions, courts must accept complainants’ admissible evidence as being true,
cannot consider credibility or weigh evidence, and evaluate defense evidence
only to determine if it conclusively has defeated plaintiff's proof as a matter
of law. (Ross v. Kish (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 188, 197; Flatley v. Mauro (2006)
39 Cal.4th 299, 326; Kashian v. Harriman (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 892, 906; Mann
v. Quality Old Time Service, Inc. (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 90, 105-106.)  Plaintiffs met their burden to present evidence
showing that Defendants prosecuted the Underlying Action without probable
cause.
As to the element of favorable
termination, Defendants argued that the December 17, 2021 settlement of the
Underlying Action and subsequent dismissal was not a favorable
termination.  To be “favorable,” the
termination must reflect the defendant's innocence of the misconduct alleged.
(Casa Herrera, Inc. v. Beydoun (2004) 32 Cal.4th 336, 341-342.)  As reviewed above, the evidence provided that
Defendants unsuccessfully defended against the demurrer and motion for
reconsideration (Bandlow Decl. pars. 42, 44-46, RJN Exhs. 32, 34, and 37) and
filed an appeal of the Court’s adverse ruling (Bandlow Decl. par. 47, RJN Exh.
38).  The adverse ruling was based upon
the Court’s finding of a sham pleading. 
It was only after the Court ruled against Defendants and while the
appeal was pending that Defendants settled the Underlying Action.  The ultimate settlement/dismissal in the Underlying
Action did reflect Defendants’ innocence because the settlement/dismissal was a
result of the Court’s adverse ruling showing that Defendants claims were
unmerited.  The settlement/dismissal do
not negate the Court’s adverse ruling. 
Plaintiffs met their burden to show a favorable termination of the
Underlying Action.
As to malice, the Court infers
malice from Defendants’ lack of probable cause in continuing to prosecute an
action they knew was initiated based on a forged signature.  (Cole v. Patricia A. Meyer & Associates,
APC (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1095, 1113-1114; Nunez v. Pennisi (2015) 241
Cal.App.4th 861, 877.)  The allegations
in the instant malicious prosecution action and the evidence submitted in
opposition to Defendants’ Anti-SLAPP motion demonstrated that: (1) Plaintiffs’
provided Defendants’ with substantial evidence proving that the Underlying
Action was premised on a putative contract with Cypers’ forged signature; (2)
Defendants’ were aware that the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department had opened a
criminal investigation against Granatelli as to his forgery; and (3)
Defendants’ continued to prosecute the case despite Granatelli’s “no contest”
plead in the criminal proceedings. 
Because of the evidence presented, there is sufficient showing on the
element of malice.
Plaintiffs’ met their minimal
burden showing that this action is likely to prevail on the merits.  
Defendants’ special motion to
strike is DENIED.
Plaintiffs requested $4,800 in
fees and costs and argued that the instant motion was frivolous and solely
intended to cause unnecessary delay. 
(Code Civ. Proc., sec. 425.16(c)(1).) 
Plaintiffs argued that the instant motion was frivolous/intended to
cause delay because the motion was filed in spite of the granting of Fox’s
special motion to strike in the Underlying Action and the ruling on
Co-Defendants Stephen T. Holzer and Lewitt, Hackman, Shapiro, Marshall &
Harlan’s Special Motion to Strike in the instant action.  Frivolousness requires a finding that “any
reasonable attorney would agree such motion is totally devoid of merit.  (City of Rocklin v. Legacy Family
Adventures-Rocklin, LLC (2022) 86 Cal.App.5th 713, 734; Moore v. Shaw (2004)
116 Cal.App.4th 182, 199;  Code Civ.
Proc., sec. 128.5(b)(2).)  Defendants’
motion presented facts to dispute that the Underlying Action lacked probable
cause.  The evidence presented in the
motion provided grounds to support the motion so that any reasonable attorney
would see that the motion was not “totally” devoid of merit.  The fact that other parties filed special
motions to strike and did not prevail is irrelevant to whether the instant
motion was devoid of merit.  The facts
applicable to Defendants are not completely the same as the facts reviewed in
the other special motions to strike so that the other rulings would apply to
Defendants.  Plaintiffs’ argument that
the instant motion was frivolous/intended to delay is not persuasive.
Plaintiffs’ request for fees and
costs is DENIED.  
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE NOTICE.
