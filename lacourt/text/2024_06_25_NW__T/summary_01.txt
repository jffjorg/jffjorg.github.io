And here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendants' special motion to strike the complaint and grants their request for judicial notice. The judge also denies the plaintiffs' request for attorneys' fees and costs. The ruling is based on the evidence presented by both sides, which showed that the defendants continued to prosecute the underlying action without probable cause. The judge found that the plaintiffs met their burden to show that the defendants lacked probable cause and that the settlement of the underlying action was a result of the court's adverse ruling. The judge also inferred malice from the defendants' lack of probable cause and found that the plaintiffs' allegations in the instant malicious prosecution action and the evidence submitted in opposition to the defendants' anti-SLAPP motion demonstrated that the defendants were aware of the forgery and continued to prosecute the case despite the criminal investigation.
