Defendants Juan Argueta and Blanca Argueta’s Demurrer
to Complaint and Motion to Strike
The court has
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers.
The hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by
Defendants Juan Argueta and Blanca Argueta is CONTINUED so that the parties can
engage in sufficient meet and confer discussions. Defendants have not satisfied
the meet and confer requirement pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41 and
434.5.
 
Background
            This
action stems from alleged wrongful actions taken against Plaintiff Anne Devine
(Plaintiff) during her tenancy at 145 South Avenue, Unit 57, Los Angeles, CA
90042 (The Property). (Compl. ¶ 1.) Defendants Juan Argueta and Blanca Argueta
(Defendants) constituted the landlords under each of Plaintiff’s leases. (Ibid.
¶ 4.) 
            On
July 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendants and Does 1
through 100, alleging causes of action for: (1) violation of Civ. Code §
1942.4, (2) tortious breach of warranty of habitability, (3) private nuisance,
(4) violation of Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq., (5) negligence,
(6) breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, (7) intentional infliction of
emotional distress, (8) negligence per se, (9) violation of the Consumer
Legal Remedies Act, (10) violation of the Los Angeles Tenant Anti-Harassment
Ordinance, (11) trespassing, (12) violation of Civ. Code § 1954, and (13) termination
of estate. 
            On
October 10, 2023, Defendants filed a demurrer to the seventh cause of action in
the complaint, on the grounds that it fails to state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action and it is uncertain, as well as a motion to
strike. 
            On
March 28, 2024, Plaintiff filed an Opposition to the demurrer and motion to
strike. 
            On
August 1, 2024, Defendants filed their Reply briefs. 
            On
August 5, 2024, the Court, on its own motion, continued the hearing on the
demurrer and motion to strike from August 5, 2024 to August 26, 2024. (08/05/24
Minute Order.) On August 26, 2024, the Court, on its own motion, continued the
hearing to September 26, 2024, due to a failure of the parties to properly meet
and confer. 
 
Legal Standard 
When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
“A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters. Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of
the pleading or are judicially noticed.” (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) “The
only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands,
unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of action.” (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) However, a pleader must “allege facts
not conclusions.” (Ankeny v. Lockhead Missiles & Space Co. (1979) 88
Cal.App.3d 531, 537.) The Court will not assume the truth of legal conclusions
unsupported by factual allegations. (Hernandez v. General Adjustment Bureau (1998)
199 Cal.App.3d 999, 1002.) 
            When a demurrer
is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable
possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18
Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a
pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.; Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015)
244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) 
            “Any party,
within the time allowed to respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of
motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
435(b)(1).) A court may “[s]trike out any irrelevant, false or improper matter
inserted in any pleading.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 436(a).) A court may “[s]trike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 436(b).)
 
Meet
and Confer
            Before filing a demurrer or motion
to strike, the moving party must meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by
video conference with the party who filed the pleading to attempt to reach an
agreement that would resolve the objections to the pleading. (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 430.41, 435.5.) “Any determination by the court that the meet and confer
process was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer” or to grant or deny a motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41(a)(4),
435.5.) 
            On August 26, 2024, this Court
continued the hearing on the demurrer and motion to strike because the parties
did not adequately meet and confer. As stated in that ruling, Defendants’
counsel, Matthew C. Dingilian (Dingilian), provided identical declarations
stating his efforts to attempt to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel,
such as sending a meet and confer letter via email and certified mail and
calling the office of Plaintiff’s Counsel directly and leaving a voicemail.
(Ruling, 08/26/24; Dingilian Decls., ¶ 2.) This Court found these actions to be
insufficient to satisfy the meet and confer requirement as “counsel did not
meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference.” (Ruling,
08/26/24.) 
However, since this Court’s ruling on August 26, 2024, Defendants have
not provided the Court with any declaration outlining that Defendants have
satisfied the meet and confer requirement. As stated in this Court’s prior
ruling, because this department strictly construes the meet and confer
requirement prior to ruling on a demurrer or motion to strike, “meeting and
conferring via letter did not satisfy the meet and confer requirement under
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.31 and 435.5.” (Ruling 08/26/24.) Because Defendants
have not filed a declaration satisfying the meet and confer requirement, the
Court will not assess the merits of the demurrer and motion to strike at this
time. 
The Court therefore CONTINUES the hearing on the demurrer and motion to
strike. 
 
It is so
ordered.
