Motion for Terminating Sanctions 
 
The Court has
considered the moving and opposition papers. 
The motion is
GRANTED in part.  
Background
            This
is an action that arises from the alleged failure to pay monies owed pursuant
to a contract for renovating a property located at 901 East 12th Street, Los
Angeles, CA 90021 (the “Property”). On May 11, 2021, Plaintiff Fire Guard
Corporation dba Builtright Engineering and Construction (“Plaintiff”) filed a
Complaint against Defendants Stanford and 12th Street, LP, Shu C. Kou, Shan C.
Kou, and DOES 1 to 100, inclusive, alleging causes of action for: (1) breach of
contract; (2) open book account; (3) account stated; (4) quantum meruit; and
(5) foreclosure of mechanic’s lien. 
            On
July 7, 2021, Defendants Shu C. Kou and Shan C. Kou (collectively, the “Kous”) filed
an Answer to the Complaint. 
            Also,
on July 7, 2021, the Kou Defendants filed a Cross-Complaint against
Cross-Defendants Stanford and 12th Street, LP; Stanford Mart, LP; Mayer
Separzadeh; Shahin S. Zackary; Said Bral (collectively, “Cross-Defendants”);
and ROES 1 through 25, inclusive, alleging causes of action for: (1) implied
contractual indemnity; (2) expressed contractual indemnity; (3) breach of
lease; (4) breach of guaranty; and (5) account stated. 
            On
March 7, 2022, Cross-Defendant Mayer Separzadeh (“Separzadeh”) filed an Answer
to the Cross-Complaint filed by the Kous. 
            Also,
on March 7, 2022, Cross-Defendant Stanford Mart, LP filed an Answer to the
Cross-Complaint filed by the Kous. On this date, Cross-Defendants Standford and
12th Street, LP and Shahin S. Zackary filed an Answer to the Cross-Complaint
filed by the Kous.
            On
April 29, 2024, the Court deemed the instant action as the lead case and
related this action to Mayer Separzadeh, et al. v. Shu Chin
Kou, et al., LASC Case No. 23STCV15591 (the “Separzadeh Action”). (Minute
Order, 04/29/24.) 
            On
May 8, 2024, the Court entered an order, pursuant to stipulation, that related
and consolidated the instant action with Kou Family Irrevocable Grantor
Trust v. Stanford Mart L.P., et al., LASC Case No.
23STCV10843 (the “UD Action”) and related and consolidated the instant action
with the Separzadeh Action. The instant action was deemed the lead case, and
the UD Action was stayed pursuant to the Court’s April 29, 2024 order. (Order,
05/08/24.) The Court stayed the UD Action pending a final judgment in the
consolidated trial of the instant action and the Separzadeh Action. (Order, 05/08/24.)

            On
June 11, 2024, Separzadeh filed and served a Motion for Terminating Sanctions
on the grounds that the Kous continue to misuse the discovery process and are
in disobedience of the Court’s orders on April 30, 2024, granting Separzadeh’s
motion to compel responses and production to Document Request, Set 1. (Motion,
page 2.) 
            On
June 21, 2024, Separzadeh filed an amended Motion for Terminating Sanctions,
including a request to seek evidentiary and/or issue sanctions.
            On
September 13, 2024, the Kous filed its Opposition to Separzadeh’s Motion. 
 
Legal Standard 
            If
a party fails to comply with a court order compelling discovery responses or
attendance at a deposition, the court may impose monetary, issue, evidence, or
terminating sanctions. CCP § 2025.450(h) (depositions); § 2030.290(c)
(interrogatories); § 2031.300(c) (demands for production of documents); §
2033.290(e) (requests for admission). CCP § 2023.030 provides that, “[t]o the
extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method . .
. , the court, after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and
after opportunity for hearing, may impose . . . [monetary, issue, evidence, or
terminating] sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of
the discovery process . . . .” CCP § 2023.010 provides that “[m]isuses of the
discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following: . . . (d)
Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. . . . (g)
Disobeying a court order to provide discovery. . . . ”
“The trial
court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse ‘after considering
the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the party to determine if
the actions were willful; the detriment to the propounding party; and the
number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.’” (Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 377, 390 [quoting Lang
v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246].) “Generally, ‘[a] decision to
order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation
is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce
compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.’ ” (Los Defensores,
supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at 390, citation omitted.)
“Under
this standard, trial courts have properly imposed terminating sanctions when
parties have willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders.” (Id. at
390 [citing Lang, supra, 77 Cal.App.4th at 1244-1246 [discussing cases];
see, e.g., Collisson & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th
1611, 1617-1622 [terminating sanctions imposed after defendants failed to
comply with one court order to produce discovery]; Laguna Auto Body v.
Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231 Cal. App. 3d 481, 491, disapproved on other
grounds in Garcia v. McCutchen (1997) 16 Cal. 4th 469, 478, n.4
[terminating sanctions imposed against plaintiff for failing to comply with a
discovery order and for violating various discovery statutes].)
 
Discussion
            With
the Motion, Separzadeh is requesting terminating sanctions, including striking
of the Kous’ cross-complaint with prejudice. (Motion, page 5-6.) With the
amended motion, Separzadeh is requesting Issue and Evidence sanctions in the
alternative. Separzadeh is additionally seeking for the Kous and their
attorneys to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $8,310.00.

Evidence
     

Evidence
      in Support of the Motion


Counsel for
Separzadeh, Shab D. Kerendian (Kerendian), provides a declaration in support of
the motion. Kerendian states the following: on April 18, 2023, Kerendian served
the first set of Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Admission
Requests, and the subject Document Requests, to which the Kous provided
untimely responses. (Kerendian Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.) Kerendian attempted to meet and
confer with the Kous’ counsel for proper verified responses, to which Kous’
counsel “simply ignored.” (Id. ¶ 5, Exhibit 1.) On May 22, 2023, Kous’
counsel eventually provided verified responses, but provided ones that were
“defective, as they contained objections, when any and all objections had been
waived due to the Kous’ failure to timely serve the responses.” (Id. ¶
7.) Kous’ continually refused to provide verified responses that were void of
objections. (Id. ¶ 8.) 
As a result of
the Kous’ conduct, on April 30, 2024, this Court granted Separzadeh’s Motion to
Compel responses and production of documents to the Document Requests, Set 1,
and ordered the Kous’ counsel to pay $810.00 in monetary sanctions within 20
days of the order. Kerendian states that the Kous never timely provided the
responses and production, nor paid the ordered sanctions. On June 6, 2024, This
Court also granted Separzadeh’s motion to compel response to Form
Interrogatories, Set 1, and Special Interrogatories, Set 1, and ordered the
Kous’ counsel to pay $1,245.00 in monetary sanctions within 30 days of the
order.
Kerendian
declares that Separzadeh cannot move forward with the case or adequately
prepare for trial without the above responses and production, and thus has been
prejudiced by the Kous’ conduct. (Id. ¶ 16.)


Evidence
      in Opposition to the Motion


Counsel for the
Kous, Miles L. Prince (Prince), provides a declaration in opposition to the
motion. Prince states the following: timely responses to Separzadeh’s Requests
for Production were provided on May 22, 2023. (Miles Decl., Exhibit 1.) Miles
states that the Kous produced over 1,300 pages of documents, and that the only
deficiencies asserted remained the missing verification. (Opposition, page 5.) This
Court confirmed in its April 30, 2024 order that the responses that Separzadeh
requested were provided, albeit without verification. While verification to
these responses was not timely provided, the Kous ultimately signed their
verification on March 7, 2024. (Id., Exhibit 2.) Separzadeh’s counsel provided
receipt of the verification, stating that that he received it on June 25, 2024.
(Id.) 

Appropriateness
     of Sanctions Against the Kous 

Terminating
      Sanctions 


As established
above, on April 30, 2024, this Court granted Separzadeh’s motion to compel the
responses for the Requests of Production, which are at issue in this current
motion. In its ruling, given that the Kous untimely provided their responses
which waived all objections, the Court ordered the Kous to provide verified
responses, without objections, within 20 days. (Ruling, 04/30/24.) This would
have been on or before May 20, 2024. However, Separzadeh confirmed receipt of
the verification on June 25, 2024, which is over a month past due. (Prince
Decl., Exhibit 2.) While the Kous’ counsel attempts to explain that he provided
the verification on March 7, 2024, Separzadeh’s counsel confirmed receipt of
the verification on June 25, 2024 and the Kous did not provide Proof of Service
to confirm exactly when the verification was served. (Ibid.) Given that
no Proof of Service was provided upon Separzadeh’s counsel, the Court can only
assume that the Kous supplied the verification on June 25, 2024, which would be
after Separzadeh filed the current motion to seek terminating sanctions.  
Further, the
verification was accompanied with the same responses that the Kous provided to
Separzadeh on May 22, 2034, prior to the Court’s order on April 30, 2024. (Ibid.,
Exhibit 1, 2.) The Kous did not provide Separzadeh with updated responses that
lacked objections pursuant to this Court’s April 30 order. (Ibid.,
Exhibit 1, 2.) Not only are the Kous not in compliance with this Court’s April
30 order, given that the verification was accompanied with the original
responses that still contained objections, but the verification was purportedly
provided under threat of Separzadeh’s current Motion for Terminating Sanctions.
Even under the threat of this Court imposing terminating sanctions, the Kous
did not strictly comply with the Court’s order. 
Similarly, on
June 6, 2024, this Court granted Separzadeh’s Motion to Compel, compelling the
Kous to provide properly verified responses without objections to Form and
Special Interrogatories, Set 1 within 30 days of the order. Like with the April
30 order, the Kous have not complied with the June 6 order and have yet to
provide Separzadeh with the interrogatories responses without objections. (Tran
Reply Decl., ¶¶ 3-6.)  While violation of
the June 6 order is not part of the instant motion, the violation is relevant
in establishing whether the Kous’ misconduct is “willful” and part of a
“history of abuse.” (Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at 390.)
The Court also
acknowledges that the Kous in their opposition do not address Separzadeh’s
assertion that the Kous failed to comply with the Court’s orders to pay
monetary sanctions. This Court on April 30, 2024, ordered the Kous to pay Separzadeh
$810.00 in monetary sanctions within 20 days, which should have been paid on or
before May 20, 2024. (Kerendian Decl., ¶ 9.) 
The Court on June 6, 2024 also ordered the Kous to pay Separzadeh
$1,245.00 in monetary sanctions within 30 days, which should have been paid on
or before July 6, 2024. According to Kerendian’s declaration, the Kous have yet
paid these amounts, and the Kous have failed to provide oppositional evidence
to dispute this claim. (Kerendian Decl., ¶ 9.) 
The Court finds
that these facts can establish grounds for terminating sanctions. 
In Siry
Investment, L.P. v. Farkhondehpour (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 1098, 1118, the
court found that the defendants had a “fulsome history of discovery abuses,”
which included violation of a court order. The Court in Siry found that
the defendants persistently refused to comply with their discovery obligations,
“making this one of the ‘extreme cases’ where terminating sanctions were
appropriate in the first instance for violation of a court order.” (Siry,
supra, 45 Cal.App.5th at 1119.) Similarly, here the Kous have continuously
delayed providing Separzadeh with the responses that this Court ordered the
Kous to compel. The Court’s order was rendered on April 30, 2024, with
Separzadeh propounding the original discovery request on April 18, 2023. As of
the time that Separzadeh filed the instant Motion, the Kous had yet to provide
the verification, as was ordered by the Court. (Kerendian Decl., ¶ 15.) 
While the Kous
claim that they eventually provided the verification to the responses, Separzadeh’s
counsel stated that he received it on June 25, 2024, which was after Separzadeh
filed this motion. (Prince Decl., Exhibit 2.) The Kous have not provided with
Proof of Service to refute otherwise. (Id.) Furthermore, the Kous did
not comply with this Court’s order in providing responses without objection. The
verification that the Kous provided was given alongside the same responses that
the Kous presented on May 22, 2023, which contained objections that were
ultimately waived. (Id., Exhibit 1.) 
Also, given that
this Court has previously imposed sanctions against the Kous, and they have not
complied with this Court’s orders, terminating sanctions would be appropriate
because the Kous have demonstrated that “less severe sanctions would not produce
compliance.” (Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at 391.) While
terminating sanctions are not justified solely because of a failure to pay
monetary discovery sanctions, the failure of the Kous to pay the ordered monetary
discovery sanctions coupled with the Kous previously explained misconduct is
sufficient in imposing terminating sanctions. (Newland v. Superior Ct.
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 615.)
However, the
Court acknowledges that terminating sanctions “are the most ‘drastic’ penalty, [as]
they are typically a ‘last resort’ to be ‘used sparingly.’” (Siry, supra,
Cal.App.5th at 1118.) The Court does note that the required verification to the
discovery requests was eventually provided to Separzadeh on June 25, 2024.
(Prince Decl., Exhibit 2.) Thus, there is some modicum of compliance. In Reedy
v. Bussell (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1272, 1293, the appellate court, in
affirming the trial court’s imposition of terminating sanctions, found that the
trial court “bent over so far backward in its effort to ensure this case would
proceed on the merits—to give [the defendants] every benefit of the doubt, and
every opportunity to ultimately comply with their obligations.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 995, citing Reedy,
supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at 1293). Accordingly, the Court finds that imposing
terminating sanctions at this time would not give the Kous “every benefit of
the doubt,” given that the Kous have at least attempted to abide by their
discovery obligations by providing the required verification to the discovery requests.
Though the Court does find that there is sufficient evidence that the Kous have
“willfully disobeyed one or more discovery orders,” and violated this Court’s
previous orders. (Defensores, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at 390.) 
Therefore, the
Court will CONTINUE the hearing on issuing terminating sanctions against the
Kous for 10 days to provide the Kous with a final opportunity to strictly
comply with this Court’s orders on both April 30, 2024 and June 6, 2024. 
 


Issue
      and Evidence Sanctions 


Separzadeh has
not provided any legal basis upon which to impose issue and evidence sanctions.
(Am. Motion, pages 1-11.)  Issue and
evidence sanctions must be designed to “accomplish the objects of [the]
discovery.” (Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 481, 487–488.) Issue and evidence sanctions should “involve[] only
matters [the moving party] had tried to prove through the impeded discovery and
[be] properly tailored to the specific harm caused by such withheld discovery
”
(Vallbona v. Springer (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 1525, 1548.) 
In his amended
motion, Separzadeh simply “requests” the Court to grant issue and evidence
sanctions against the Kous, with an itemized list of exactly what kind of issue
and evidence sanctions Separzadeh would like the Court to grant. (Am. Motion,
pages 1-11.)  The amended motion does not
attempt to make an argument as to how exactly the Kous’ conduct is deserving of
both kind of sanctions, nor does it attempt to make a connection between the
Kous’ conduct and the proposed specific harm that it caused. (Am. Motion, pages
1-11.)  Separzadeh does not explain how
the evidence or issue sanctions that he seeks are directly tied to the objects
of the requested discovery. (Ibid.) 
Further, the
issue and evidence sanctions that Separzadeh seeks would likely be tantamount
to an issuance of terminating sanctions. (Am. Motion, pages 1-11.) For example,
Separzadeh seeks for the Kous to be prohibited from introducing “[a]ny and all
alleged facts and evidence, whether testimonial, documentary, or otherwise,
from any party or party-affiliated witnesses, in opposition of the following
claims by Mayer in connection with the Kous’ operative Cross-Complaint,”
including “[Separzadeh’s] affirmative defenses.”  (Am. Motion, pages 4.) Precluding the Kous’
from introducing evidence in opposition to Separzadeh’s affirmative defenses
would not allow the Kous to effectively pursue their cross-complaint, which
would ultimately have the same effect as issuing a terminating sanction. 
Thus, the Court DENIES
the imposition of issue and evidence sanctions against the Kous. 
 


Monetary
      Sanctions 


 "[M]onetary sanctions, in an amount
incurred, including attorney fees, by anyone as a result of the offending
conduct, must be imposed unless the trial court finds the sanctioned
party acted with substantial justification or the sanction is otherwise unjust.”
(Cornerstone Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare REIT, Inc. (2020)
56 Cal.App.5th 771, 789.) 
As explained
above, the Kous’ conduct was improper. Not only did the Kous not provide the
necessary verification with the requested discovery responses in a timely
fashion, the Kous provided the verification on June 25, 2024, under the threat
of the imposition of terminating sanctions. Further, the verification that the
Kous did provide was not accompanied with Proof of Service or with responses
that lacked objections. 
Additionally,
the Kous did not provide substantial justification for their misconduct because
they only state that the May 22, 2023 responses were not verified “due to their
experiencing health problems, including extended periods of hospitalizations,
and were physically unable to verify the response.” (Opposition, page 4.)  However, this reasoning was already addressed
by this Court in its April 30, 2024 order. The Kous have not provided any
additional explanation as to why they are still in noncompliance. While
terminating sanctions may not be currently appropriate, it is evident from the
Kous’ conduct that monetary sanctions are. 
Separzadeh’s
counsel, Kerendian, declares that the Kous should be sanctioned $8,310.00 in
attorneys’ fees and expected costs. (Kerendian Decl., ¶ 17.) Counsel declares
that his reasonable hourly rate is $750.00, given that since 1996, he has
handled approximately “hundreds of trials, arbitrations, and mediations.” (Ibid.
¶ 20.) The Court finds this fee to be reasonable, given Kerendian’s quantity
and quality of experience. Counsel requests the following:
-         
5 hours in preparing the Motion.
-         
3 anticipated hours to review any
opposition and prepare reply papers.
-         
3 hours to prepare for, travel to
and from, and attend the hearing.
-         
$60.00 in filing fees. 
While the Court
finds Counsel’s fee to be reasonable because of Counsel’s quantity and 
quality of experience, the Court also
finds that the hours spent in preparing the Motion and Reply and reviewing the
Opposition papers to be excessive, given Counsel’s quality and quantity of
experience in such matters. Thus, the Court will decrease the total hours of
Motion/Reply preparation and Opposition review from 8 hours to 5 hours. Five
hours plus 3 hours to prepare for, travel to and from, and attend the hearing
at $750.00 per hour plus the $60.00 in filing fees will equal $6,060.00. 
 
 
 
Conclusion
The Court
therefore CONTINUES the hearing on Separzadeh’s motion for terminating
sanctions for 10 days pending the Kous’ strict compliance with this Court’s
previous orders. 
The Court DENIES
Separzadeh’s request for issue and evidence sanctions. 
The Court GRANTS
Separzadeh’s request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $6,060.00. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
