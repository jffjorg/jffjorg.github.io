```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer and motion to strike filed by defendants Juan Argueta and Blanca Argueta. The demurrer challenges the seventh cause of action in the complaint, alleging that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and is uncertain. The court has also reviewed the parties' meet and confer efforts, which are required before filing a demurrer or motion to strike. The court finds that the parties did not adequately meet and confer, and therefore will not assess the merits of the demurrer and motion to strike at this time. The hearing is continued to allow the parties to engage in sufficient meet and confer discussions.
