And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants summary judgment to defendants Future Growth, LLC and 621 Two LLC as to plaintiff Guzman Energy, Inc.'s complaint. The court finds that plaintiff's leasehold interest in the two oil well leases was terminated due to default in royalty payments, and that plaintiff no longer has a right to access the land. The court also grants summary adjudication to defendants as to their cross-complaint for causes of action one, three, four, five, and eight.

The court dismisses certain causes of action without prejudice, including causes of action two, six, and seven. The court finds that plaintiff's continued possession of the land without a valid lease caused damage to defendants, the rightful owner and possessor of the property.

The court orders that defendants be granted a judicial determination that the leases were legally terminated, and that plaintiff must abandon the wells, provide an accounting of revenue earned since defendant Future Growth became lessor of the leases, and pay past due royalties.
