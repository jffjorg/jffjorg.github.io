And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the motion to be relieved as counsel, filed by Darren Le Montree, counsel for the defendant, Jasmin Shokrian. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, which prevents the attorney from continuing in that role. The judge finds that the attorney has complied with the necessary procedures, including providing notice to the client and filing the required supporting declaration. The judge also notes that there will be adequate time to retain new counsel before the next hearing, which is set for August 19, 2024.
