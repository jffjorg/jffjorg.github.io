And here is the English text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment in this medical malpractice action. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant, Marian Pak, D.O., provided negligent treatment and care, resulting in the plaintiff's injuries. The defendant argues that her care and treatment were appropriate and within the standard of care. The plaintiff argues that the defendant breached the standard of care and caused the plaintiff's injuries. The judge finds that the issue of whether the defendant's care and treatment were appropriate and within the standard of care is a triable issue of material fact, and therefore denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
