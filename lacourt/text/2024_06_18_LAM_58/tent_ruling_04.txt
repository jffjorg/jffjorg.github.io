Tentative Ruling:      The Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is granted.          

             
            This case arises from a landlord-tenant
dispute. On June 29, 2023, Plaintiffs Lehrer-Graiwer
and Sarah Lehrer-Graiwer (Plaintiffs) filed a Complaint against Defendant
Jasmin Shokrian (Defendant). On March 4, 2024, Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Jasmin Shokrian filed a Cross-Complaint. 
 
             Defendant Jasmin Shokrian’s counsel – Darren Le Montree – seeks to be relieved as counsel of record. 
            The motion to be
relieved as counsel is granted.    
 
Discussion
 
            An attorney is entitled to withdraw
upon the consent of the client, or without that consent if approved by the
court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 284; Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) In the latter case, counsel must make a motion to be
relieved as attorney of record.  The
motion must be made using mandatory forms: Notice of Motion and Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel – Civil (MC-051), Declaration (MC-052), and Proposed Order
(MC-053). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (a), (b), (e).) 
 
            The declaration accompanying the
motion to be relieved as counsel must state “in general terms and without
compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a
motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(2) is brought instead of
filing a consent under Code of Civil Procedure section 284(1).” (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (b).)
 
            The notice to the client must be
done by personal service, electronically, or mail. If it is done via mail under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1013, it must be accompanied by a declaration
confirming the service address to be the most current residence or that it is
the client’s last known address, and the attorney has been unable to locate a
more current address. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (d)(1)(A)-(B).) 
 
            Here, Attorney Montree has
complied with the Rules of Court by filing all the appropriate forms (MC-051,
MC-052, and MC-053). He has also submitted a supporting declaration providing
an adequate explanation for why he is moving to be relieved as counsel; he
asserts that there has been a breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship that prevents him from continuing in that role.
 
Further,
Form MC-052 indicates that notice was provided to Defendant via mail and the
last known address had been confirmed by telephone. 
 
Additionally,
trial in this matter is not set until October 20, 2025, and the next hearing is
a Status Conference set for August 19, 2024. Thus, no prejudice will result
from granting this motion where there is adequate time to retain new counsel. 
 
The Court
will grant the motion to be relieved as counsel.
