And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint and the motion to enforce settlement. The plaintiff, West Coast Add It Up Ad Agency, alleged a breach of contract claim against the defendant, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and its employees. The defendant filed a demurrer, arguing that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, fails to comply with basic pleading rules, is barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and fails to plead whether the plaintiff complied with the Government Tort Claims Act.

The judge sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, finding that the plaintiff has failed to comply with the court rules and code requirements. The judge also denied the motion to enforce settlement, as the plaintiff failed to provide any evidence that a settlement agreement exists.

The court's tentative ruling is as follows:

1. The demurrer to the plaintiff's entire Third Amended Complaint is sustained without leave to amend.
2. The motion to enforce settlement is denied.
