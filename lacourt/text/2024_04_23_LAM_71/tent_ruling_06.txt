Plaintiff Almost Nothing, Inc. (“Almost Nothing”)
(“Plaintiff”) moves unopposed to compel further responses from Defendant

Documents (Set One) (“RFP”) and requests sanctions against Morad in the total
amount of $4,090.  (Notice Motion Morad
RFP, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§2023.010 et seq., 2031.010 et seq.)
Plaintiff moves to compel further responses
from Morad to its Request for Admissions (Set One) (“RFA”).  (Notice Motion Morad RFA, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§2023.010
et seq., 2033.010 et seq.)
Plaintiff moves unopposed to compel
further responses from Morad to its Form Interrogatories (Set One)
(“FROG”).  (Notice Motion Morad FROG, pg.
2; C.C.P. §§2023.010 et seq., 2030.010 et seq.)
Plaintiff moves unopposed to compel
further responses from Morad to its Special Interrogatories (Set One)
(“SROG”).  (Notice Motion Morad SROG, pg.
2; C.C.P. §§2023.010 et seq., 2030.010 et seq.)
Plaintiff moves unopposed to compel
further responses from Defendant Shawn Simon Neman (“Shawn”) (“Defendant”) to
its Request for Admissions (Set One) (“RFA”) and requests sanctions against
Shawn in the total amount of $2,595. 
(Notice Motion Shawn RFA, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§2023.010 et seq., 2033.010 et
seq.)
Plaintiff moves unopposed to compel
further responses from Shawn to its Special Interrogatories (Set One)
(“SROG”).  (Notice Motion Shawn SROG, pg.
2; C.C.P. §§2023.010 et seq., 2030.010 et seq.)

its Request for Production of Documents (Set One) (“RFP”) and requests
sanctions against LAML in the total amount of $1,710.  (Notice Motion LAML RFP, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§2023.010

Plaintiff moves unopposed to compel
further responses from Defendant Pacific Printex Corp. (“PPC”) (“Defendant”) to
its Request for Production of Documents (Set One) (“RFP”) and requests
sanctions against PPC in the total amount of $1,710.  (Notice Motion PPC RFP, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§2023.010
et seq., 2031.010 et seq.)
The
Court denies Plaintiff’s motions on the basis Plaintiff failed to follow the
Information Regarding Procedures in Department 71, which requires that “[p]arties
seeking to compel further responses to discovery, must schedule an Informal Discovery
Conference (IDC) before the Court will hear their motions. The Court may deny a
motion to compel further responses to discovery if parties fail to schedule and
complete an IDC before the scheduled hearing on the motion.”  (Information Regarding Procedures, pg. 4.)
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motions are denied.
Morad
filed an opposition to Plaintiff’s motion to compel further RFAs, requesting
sanctions against Plaintiff in the amount of $1,750.00 for having to oppose the
instant motion.  (Opposition Morad RFA,
pg. 2.)  However, Morad’s notice of
opposition does not provide the code section under which it seeks sanctions
against Plaintiff.  Therefore, the Court
declines to grant Morad’s request for sanctions against Plaintiff.
Moving
Party to give notice.
