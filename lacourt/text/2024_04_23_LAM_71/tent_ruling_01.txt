  Case Number:  20STCV39806    Hearing Date:   April 23, 2024    Dept:  71 Superior  Court of California County  of Los Angeles   DEPARTMENT 71   TENTATIVE  RULING      LUIS    SANCHEZ,    et al.,               vs.   KIA    MOTORS AMERICA, INC., et al.        Case No.:     20STCV39806        Hearing Date:  April 23, 2024      Defendant Kia Motors America,  Inc.’s motion to strike, or in the alternative, tax costs claimed by Plaintiffs  Luis Sanchez and Shannon Sanchez is granted in the reduced total of $1,776.26.   Defendant Kia America, Inc. (“KA”)  (“Defendant”) moves to strike, or in the alternative, tax costs claimed by  Plaintiffs Luis Sanchez (“Luis”) and Lauren Sanchez (“Lauren”) (collectively,  “Plaintiffs”) on the ground that many of the costs Plaintiffs claim are not  recoverable or are otherwise unreasonable.   (Notice Motion, pgs. 1-2; C.C.P. §§1032, 1033, 1033.5 et seq.)     Background This is a lemon law action  brought under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (“Song-Beverly Act”).  The matter was compelled to arbitration on  April 20, 2021, and arbitration was initiated on July 29, 2021.  The parties settled the matter through a C.C.P.  §998 Offer to Compromise (“998 Offer”) on May 1, 2023. On December 11, 2023, Plaintiffs  filed their memorandum of costs.  On December  28, 2023, Defendant filed the instant motion.   Plaintiffs filed their opposition on April 10, 2024.  Defendant filed its reply on April 16, 2024.   Motion  to Tax Costs  Civil Code  §1794(d) provides that a buyer who prevails in an action under that section,  “shall be allowed by the court to recover as a part of the judgment a sum equal  to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based  on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably  incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and the prosecution  of such action.”  “Section  1794, subdivision (d), permits the prevailing buyer to recover both ‘costs’ and  ‘expenses.’”  (Jensen v. BMW of North  America (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 112, 137.)  “[I]t is clear the Legislature intended the  word ‘expenses’ to cover items not included in the detailed statutory  definition of ‘costs.’”  (Id.)  Jensen v. BMW of North America expressly  states that the costs provision under the Song-Beverly Act is meant to include  recovery beyond those codified in C.C.P. §1033.5. (Id.)  Jensen considered the history behind  “expenses” in Civil Code §1794(d) and noted, “[a]n analysis by the Assembly  Committee on Labor, Employment, and Consumer Affairs states: ‘Indigent  consumers are often discouraged from seeking legal redress due to court costs.  The addition of awards of “costs and expenses” by the court to the consumer to  cover such out-of-pocket expenses as filing fees, expert witness fees,  marshall’s fees, etc., should open the litigation process to everyone.’”  (Id. at pg. 138, quoting Assem.  Com. on Labor, Employment & Consumer Affairs, Analysis of Assem. Bill No.  3374 (May 24, 1978), pg. 2.) Thus, the  additional term “expenses” was included in the statute to include reimbursement  of costs that would not otherwise be covered so that consumers would not have  to pay out of pocket for the expensive costs of litigation. The general  interpretation is that the term “expenses” is intended to include all  expenditures not part of overhead and which are ordinarily billed to paying  clients regardless of whether they are recoverable under C.C.P. §1033.5.  (Bussey v. Affleck (1990) 225  Cal.App.3d 1162; see also Arntz Contracting Co. v. St. Paul Fire &  Marine Insurance Co. (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 464, 491 [holding litigation  “expenses” are far broader than “costs”].) In Jensen,  the trial court initially ruled that expert fees were not recoverable under the  Act since they are not recoverable under C.C.P. §1033.5.  However, the appellate court reversed the  ruling and held that expert fees are recoverable. (Jensen, 35  Cal.App.4th at pg. 138.)  Thus, the costs  permitted under Civil Code §1794(d) of the Song-Beverly Act are purposely  broader in scope than those permitted by C.C.P. §1033.5, which in fact  expressly prohibits expert fee recovery. C.C.P. §1033.5 addresses the  recoverable “costs” and guides as to what is recoverable here, and then that  list must be expanded to account for the additional permissible “expenses.” Accordingly,  the question before the Court is whether the costs and expenses claimed are  proper on their face insofar as they either fall within the categories of C.C.P.  §1033.5 and/or were incurred in the “commencement and prosecution” of this case.   (Civ. Code §1794(d).) “If  the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is  on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or  necessary. On the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are  put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs.”  (Nelson  v. Anderson (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 111, 131.)  “[T]he  mere filing of a motion to tax costs may be a ‘proper objection’ to an item,  the necessity of which appears doubtful, or which does not appear to be proper  on its face.  [Citation] However, ‘[i]f  the items appear to be proper charges the verified memorandum is prima facie  evidence that the costs, expenses and services therein listed were necessarily  incurred by the defendant [citations], and the burden of showing that an item  is not properly chargeable or is unreasonable is upon the [objecting party].’  [Citations.]”  (Id.) “The  court’s first determination, therefore, is whether the statute expressly allows  the particular item, and whether it appears proper on its face. [Citation] If  so, the burden is on the objecting party to show them to be unnecessary or  unreasonable. [Citation.]”  (Id.)  A prevailing party is  entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding,  except as otherwise expressly provided by statute.  (C.C.P.   §1032(b).)  California law  recognizes three types of litigation costs: allowable, not allowable, and  discretionary.  (C.C.P. §§1033.5(a), (b),  (c)(4).)  Items not specifically  allowable as costs under C.C.P. §1033.5(a), and not specifically prohibited  under §1033.5(b), may be allowed as costs at the discretion of the trial court  if reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation.  (Citizens for Responsible Development v.  City of West Hollywood (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 490, 506, citing Ladas v. California  State Auto Association (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.)   For allowable costs, C.C.P. §1033.5(c)  provides:  (2) Allowable costs shall be reasonably necessary to the conduct of  the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation.   (3) Allowable costs shall be reasonable in amount.   (C.C.P. §§1033.5(c)(2)-(3).)   To the extent Defendants  challenge costs, they must be challenged as costs that were not, “reasonably  necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or  beneficial to its preparation” or not “reasonable in amount.”  (C.C.P. §§1033.5(c)(2)-(3).)     Item No. 5: Service of Process Fees Defendant  moves to tax $911.75 in four  trial/arbitration service of process fees for (a) Hello K SC, LLC, (b) Heart  and Seoul Automotive, (c) Ju Srog Park, and (d) Car Pros Kia Glendale’s PMQ on  the basis the arbitrator never issued any trial subpoenas for Hello K SC, LLC,  or Heart and Seoul Automotive.  (Motion,  pg. 2; Decl. of Yao ¶10.)  Defendant also  moves to tax the service of process for Ju Srog Park at $581.75 when the  service of process costs for the other three parties served was less than a  quarter of that cost.  (Motion, pg. 3.) Defendant  failed to meet their burden to challenge these costs because the service of  process fees claimed were necessary as part of the process of litigation.  Assuming, arguendo, Defendant met its  burden, Plaintiffs provided evidence of invoices charged to support their claim  that such costs were reasonable in amount.   (Decl. of Wirtz ¶¶5-9, Exhs. 1-5.) Accordingly, Defendant’s  request to tax costs for service of  process fees is denied.    Item No. 8: Expert Fees Defendant  moves to tax all $15,597.85 in expert  fees that Plaintiffs request.  Defendant  argues C.C.P. §1033.5(b)(1) expressly states “[f]ees of experts not ordered by  the court” are not allowable as costs, and Plaintiffs’ expert William Zimmer was  not ordered by the Court, nor did he testify in any deposition or hearings.  (Motion, pg. 3.)  However, expert fees are recoverable under  the Song-Beverly Act.  (Jensen, 35  Cal.App.4th at pg. 119 [“In her appeal, Jensen contends section 1794,  subdivision (d), authorizes an award of expert witness fees in addition to  costs. We agree . . ..”].)   Therefore,  Defendant failed to meet their burden to challenge these costs.  Assuming, arguendo, Defendant met its  burden, Plaintiffs provided evidence of Zimmer’s invoices providing the amount  claimed and incurred.  (Decl. of Wirtz  ¶¶10-14, Exhs. 6-10.) Accordingly,  Defendant’s request to tax costs for expert  fees costs is denied.    Item No. 12: Court Reporter Fees Defendant  moves to tax $1,425 in  court reporter fees as excessive, unreasonable, and not contemplated under the  California Code.  (Motion, pg. 3.)  Defendant argues it was unnecessary for a  court reporter to be present at a Case Management Conference.  (Motion, pg. 3.)  The Court agrees that a reporter is not  necessary at a Case Management Conference.   Defendant also argues Plaintiffs added $900 for court reporter fees for a  hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees, which cost has not been  incurred yet and is therefore unsupported and speculative.  (Motion, pg. 3.)  Defendant’s  request to tax $900 in court reporter fees on the instant motion is well taken,  as such fees are anticipated fees that have not been reasonably incurred and are  not recoverable.  Accordingly,  Defendant’s request to tax  court reporter fees is granted in the amount of $1,425.    Item No. 16: Other Costs Defendant  moves to tax all $4,979.91 in  other costs.   a.       Courtroom  Connect Defendant moves to tax $145  for “Courtroom Connect” on the basis LA Court Connect is free to register, and  this matter was compelled to arbitration, so it is unclear who these costs were  incurred.  (Motion, pg. 4.) Plaintiff provided receipts  for the amounts incurred and claimed for Court Connect, specifically for  counsel and the court reporter to attend the motion to compel arbitration  hearing.  (Decl. of Wirtz ¶¶17-18, Exhs. 13-14.)   Plaintiff provided invoices paid to subscribe to Court View Network and  watch a recording of a trial involving Defendant’s trial counsel and a witness,  in order to prepare for trial in this matter, which was necessary as part of  the process of litigation.  (Decl. of  Wirtz ¶19, Exhs. 15-16.) Accordingly,  Defendant’s request to tax these costs is denied.   b.      Courtesy  Copies Defendant challenges $268.96  in courtesy copies on the basis none of the pleadings and/or motions required  courtesy copies to the court.  (Motion,  pg. 4.) Plaintiffs concede they  included an anticipated cost for sending a courtesy copy for the instant motion  that was not ultimately sent, and $150.00 should be stricken.  (Opposition, pg. 6.)  However, Plaintiffs argue the costs to send  copies of a case management statement, a status report, and Plaintiffs’ reply  in support of the motion for attorneys’ fees were reasonable and necessary for  the prosecution of this action.   (Opposition, pg. 6; Decl. of Wirtz ¶¶20-22, Exhs. 17-19.) Defendant’s request to tax  costs for courtesy copies is granted in the reduced amount of $150.00.   c.       Travel  for Vehicle Inspections Defendant moves to tax travel for vehicle expenses  in the amount of $2,194.04 on the basis there is no itemization nor  information about what these costs consist of, how they were incurred, or who  incurred them.  (Foothill-De Anza  Community College District v. Emerich (2007) 158 Cal.App.4th 11, 29;  Motion, pg. 4.)  Defendant argues  Plaintiffs’ memorandum also does not state whether these charges include meals,  which are not recoverable costs, and only travel expenses for depositions are  allowable under the costs statute.   (Motion, pg. 4.)  Further,  Defendant argues there was only one vehicle inspection, which took place on  April 11, 2023, and prior to the April inspection, the parties agreed to an  inspection on January 23, 2023, but Defendant’s expert tested positive two days  before the inspection.  (Decl. of Yao  ¶5.)  Defendant argues Plaintiffs’  counsel was immediately notified the same day, on or around 1:00 p.m. on  Friday, January 20, 2023, but Plaintiffs’ counsel was already on a plane to the  vehicle inspection.  (Decl. of Yao ¶7.)  Defendant argues such costs were not reasonably incurred because Plaintiffs’  counsel did to need to travel three days ahead of the scheduled vehicle  inspection. Plaintiffs argue that in opposing this motion, Plaintiffs  realized they accidentally double-charged some items and update the total costs  incurred as travel costs for the vehicle inspections to $1,992.81 and agree that $201.26 should be stricken from  these costs.  (Opposition, pg. 6.)  Plaintiffs provide the invoices totaling the  $1,992.81 incurred for travel for the April inspection.  (Decl. of Wirtz ¶23, Exhs. 20-22.)  Accordingly,  Defendant’s  request to tax costs for hotel and travel expenses is granted in the reduced  amount of $201.26.   d.      Court  Download Charges Defendant seeks to tax court download charges in the  amount of $52.60. Plaintiffs provide the receipt for the court  download costs incurred.  (Decl. of Wirtz  ¶26, Exh. 23.)  Accordingly, Defendant’s  request to tax this cost is denied.   e.      Legal Research Defendant  challenges Plaintiffs’ claim for $540.33 for legal research.  (Motion, pg. 5.) Plaintiffs  submitted invoices of Westlaw and Kia Global Information System Subscription  cost incurred to perform research for the prosecution of this case. (Decl. of Wirtz  ¶27, Exh. 24; Civ. Code §1794(d).)  Legal  research, as well as technical research on Defendant’s technical service, is  reasonable and necessary. Accordingly, Defendant’s  request to tax this cost is denied.   f.       Printer Charges Defendant  challenges Plaintiffs’ claim for $1,568.75 for printer charges.  (Motion, pg. 5.)           Plaintiffs submitted invoices of costs  incurred to print case-related documents to bring to the cancelled first  inspection in Idaho where he also planned to meet with Plaintiffs, and to mail  a document.  (Decl. of Wirtz ¶28, Exh.  25.) Accordingly, Defendant’s  request to tax this cost is denied.   g.     Private Investigator Defendant  challenges Plaintiffs’ claim for $210.00 for “private investigator.”  (Motion, pg. 6.) Plaintiffs’  counsel incurred $210.00 in private investigator costs to perform a background  check on J.S. Park, the witness described above in the service of process  section.  (Decl. of Wirtz ¶9, Exh. 5.)  These costs were reasonable, necessary to the  prosecution of the action, and therefore are recoverable under Civil Code §1794(d). Accordingly, Defendant’s  request to tax this cost is denied.              Conclusion           Defendant’s motion to tax costs is granted  in the reduced total of $1,776.26.           Moving party to give notice.   Dated:  April _____, 2024
