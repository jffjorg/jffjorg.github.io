 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant Keith
  M. Davidson’s Motion to Compel the Deposition of Plaintiff on the Eighth and
  Ninth Causes of Action.



 
Court
Order
On October 6, 2023, Defendant Roach
filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings (MJOP) against the then-operative
First Amended Complaint’s (FAC) eighth and ninth causes of action.
On December 21, 2023, the Court
made rulings on MJOPs filed by Defendants Pacquiao, Davidson, and the CBS
Defendants (Paramount; Showtime). Pacquiao’s and Davidson’s MJOPs were granted
as to the FAC’s eighth cause of action but denied as to the ninth cause of
action, while the CBS Defendants’ MJOP was granted on both claims. In the CBS
Defendants’ ruling, the Court gave Plaintiff Rueda 20 days’ leave to amend the
FAC.
On January 7, 2024, Plaintiff Rueda
opposed Defendant Roach’s MJOP.
On January 10, 2024, as a result of
the December 21, 2023 rulings, Plaintiff Rueda filed a Second Amended Complaint
(SAC).
On January 12, 2024, Defendant
Roach replied to the 1/8/24 opposition and argued, very briefly, that the
filing of the SAC does nothing to affect the merit of the MJOP because both the
FAC and SAC are equally defective.
However, “the filing of an amended
complaint moots a motion directed to a prior complaint.” (JKC3H8 v. Colton
(2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 468, 477; accord. Sylmar Air Conditioning v. Pueblo
Contracting Services, Inc. (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1049, 1054 [“The filing
of [a] first amended complaint render[s] [a movant’s] demurrer moot since “‘an
amendatory pleading supersedes the original one, which ceases to perform any
function as a pleading,”’” citations omitted].)
As a result, Defendant Roach’s MJOP
is MOOT.
The Court will discuss with the
parties the scheduling of a new hearing regarding Defendant Roach’s challenge
to the eighth and ninth causes of action, as now alleged in the SAC, including
when a new motion can be filed and specially set, if necessary, in order to
avoid unnecessary delay.
