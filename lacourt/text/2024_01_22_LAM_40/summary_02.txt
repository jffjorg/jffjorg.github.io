The plaintiff is suing on behalf of Yelena V. Yufa's rights to parcels of land in Los Angeles County, California. The Assessor's Office has filed a demurrer arguing that the plaintiff lacks standing to sue on behalf of Yelena V. Yufa, citing the fact that the plaintiff is not a licensed attorney in the State of California. The Judge has sustained the demurrer, finding that the plaintiff may not file the Complaint as Yelena V. Yufa's legal representative.

Additionally, the Assessor's Office has filed a motion to strike the demand for jury trial, arguing that this type of case does not involve a jury trial. The Judge has granted the motion, finding that jury trial is not available in this type of case.
