Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions filed by the plaintiffs, Rene Hernandez and Maria Velasquez, to compel further responses to discovery requests and to request sanctions. The motions were filed against FCA US LLC, the defendant in the case.

The judge finds that the motion to compel further responses to request for production is MOOT, as FCA US LLC has already supplemented its production. The judge grants the request for sanctions in part, ordering FCA US LLC to pay $1,687.50 to the plaintiffs for its failure to comply with discovery requests.

The judge also finds that the motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories is MOOT, as FCA US LLC has already supplemented its responses. The judge denies the request for sanctions in this regard, as the motion was mooted before it was even filed.

The judge orders FCA US LLC to remit payment of the sanctions to the plaintiffs within 14 days of the order.
