 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiffs Rene

  for Production from Defendant FCA US LLC, and Request for Sanctions; and
Plaintiffs Rene
  Hernandez and Maria Velasquez’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Special
  Interrogatories from Defendant FCA US LLC, and Request for Sanctions.



 
Background
Plaintiffs Rene Hernandez and Maria Velasquez sue Sierra LA CDJR LLC dba
Los Angeles Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram (Sierra), FCA US LLC (FCA US), and Does 1
through 10 pursuant to A December 6, 2022 Complaint alleging claims of (1)
Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty and (2) Negligent
Repair.
The claims arise from allegations that on February 6, 2021, Plaintiffs
entered into a warranty contract with FCA US LLC regarding a 2019 Dodge Journey
(Vehicle) and that defects and nonconformities manifested themselves within the
applicable warranty period—including but not limited to engine and suspension—which
Defendant and its authorized repair facilities were not able to conform to
warranty after a reasonable number of attempts, but which nevertheless did not
prompt FCA US to repurchase or replace the Vehicle, thus violating the
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, and entitling Plaintiff to penalties, fees
and costs, and other relief.
On March 7, 2023, Plaintiffs served their First Set of Requests for
Production of Documents to Defendant FCA US LLC (RPDs, Set One) and First Set
of Special Interrogatories to Defendant FCA US LLC (SROGs, Set One.)
On April 11, 2023, FCA served objection-only responses to Plaintiffs’
discovery, though verifications were not provided until September 6, 2023.
On August 22, 2023, Plaintiffs initiated a meet and confer on the
deficient responses.
On September 13, 2023, FCA US’s counsel sent a letter to Plaintiffs’
counsel responding to Plaintiffs’ meet and confer, which maintained the
position in FCA US’s responses.
On October 12, 2023, FCA US served supplemental responses to SROGS, Set
One.
On October 23, 2023, Plaintiffs filed motions (1) to compel further
responses and production to RPDs, Set One, and for monetary sanctions, and (2)
to compel further responses to SROGS, Set One, and for monetary sanctions.
On January 8, 2024, FCA opposed
both motions.
That same day, FCA US LLC
supplemented its production to RPDs, Set One.
On January 12, 2024, Plaintiffs
replied only to the opposition relating to further responses to RPDs, Set One.
Plaintiffs’ motions are now before
the Court.
 
Motion
to Compel Further Production and Responses to Production
Legal
Standard
A
motion to compel a further response is used when a party gives unsatisfactory
answers or makes untenable objections to interrogatories, demands to produce,
or requests for admission. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a); Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 403.)
To
request further production, a movant must establish: (1) good cause for the
production (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1); Sinaiko, supra,
at p. 403); and (2) that a further response is needed because (a) the
responding party’s statement of compliance with the demand to produce is
incomplete Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(1)), (b) the responding
party’s representation that it is unable to comply is inadequate, complete, or
evasive (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (a)(2)), (c) the responding party’s
objection in the response is without merit or is too general (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.310, subd. (a)(3); Catalina Island Yacht Club v. Superior Court
(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1116, 1127), or (d) if the responding party objected to
the production of ESI on the ground that it is not reasonably accessible the
movant can show that the (i) ESI is reasonably accessible or (ii) there is good
cause for production of the ESI regardless of its accessibility (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (e)).
Order
Compelling Further Production: MOOT.
After
review, the Court determines that Plaintiffs’ motion is MOOT.
On
January 8, 2024—on the same day the opposition was filed—FCA US LLC
supplemented its production to RPDs, Set One. (See RPDs Opp’n, ¶ 15, Ex. I
[attaching copy of email for supplemental production but not attaching copy of
discovery].)
This
production is not addressed in the reply, which limits its arguments to meet
and confer, objections, and sanctions. (Reply, pp. 1-3.)
The
Court determines that the production on January 8, 2023 mooted this motion and
that any further dispute as to the discovery produced must be resolved through
a further motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 2031.310 or
2031.320, as applicable.
Sanctions:
GRANTED, in part.
Except
in certain circumstances involving electronic stored information, the court must
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel further response to a demand, unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2031.310, subd. (h).)
The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
After
review, the Court determines that sanctions are merited because though FCA US
ultimately made production, it did so at the last hour, with its opposition, on
January 8, 2024, nearly ninth months after serving its objections on April 11,
2023, thus failing to respond to an authorized method of discovery for the
better part of a year. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d); Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)
However,
the Court finds that the request is excessive and limits recovery to a
reasonable rate of $375 per hour, times 4.5 hours reasonably expended on
preparing the motion and reply and preparing for and attending the hearing,
plus $60 in filing costs, for a total recovery of $1,687.50.
Sanctions
are thus GRANTED in part in the amount of $1,687.50.
 
Motion to Compel Further Responses to
Interrogatories

Legal Standard
A motion to compel a further
response is used when a party gives unsatisfactory answers or makes untenable
objections to interrogatories, demands to produce, or requests for admission.
(See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (a), 2031.310, subd. (a), 2033.290,
subd. (a); Sinaiko, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 403
[interrogatories and demands to produce].)
To compel a further response to
interrogatories, the movant can show that: (1) the responding party’s answer to
a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.300, subd. (a)(1)); (2) the responding party’s exercise of the option to
produce documents in response to an interrogatory was unwarranted or the
required specification of those documents was inadequate (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.300, subd. (a)(2)); and (3) the responding party’s objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,
subd. (a)(3); see, e.g., Williams v. Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th
531, 550 [defendant’s argument that plaintiff was required to establish good
cause or prove merits of underlying claim before propounding interrogatories
without merit]).
Order Compelling Further
Interrogatory Responses: MOOT.
After review, the Court determines
that Plaintiffs’ motion is MOOT.
On October 12, 2023—11 days before
this motion was filed—FCA US LLC supplemented its production to RPDs, Set One.
(See SROGs Opp’n, ¶ 10, Ex. E [attaching copy of supplemental responses with
proof of service for October 12, 2023].)
There is no reply in the record.
The Court determines that the responses
served on October 12, 2023 mooted this motion. Those responses are responsive
to the dispute that led to the filing of this motion. Nevertheless, the moving
papers and the attached declaration altogether fail to mention that
supplemental responses were served on October 12, 2023, 11 days before the
motion was filed. (See SROGs Mot., pp. 2-5; SROGs Mot., Lopez Decl., ¶¶ 1-7.)
To the extent that Plaintiffs were dissatisfied with the October 12th
supplemental responses, the proper method to challenge those responses was
through a motion brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300—which
may be, as of this date, untimely.
Sanctions: DENIED.
The court must
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel a further response to interrogatories, unless it finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.300, subd. (d).)
The
court may award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a party who files
a motion to compel discovery, even though no opposition to the motion was
filed, or opposition to the motion was withdrawn, or the requested discovery
was provided to the moving party after the motion was filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1348, subd. (a).)

Sanctions are DENIED because this motion
was mooted before it was even filed.

Velasquez’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production from
