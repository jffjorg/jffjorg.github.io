And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the cross-complainant's motion to compel further responses to requests for production. The cross-complainant, Gerardo Lopez, had requested that the cross-defendant, Mosaic Solar Loan Trust 2018-1 (MSLT), produce further responses to requests for production Nos. 2, 3, and 4. The cross-defendant had objected to these requests, claiming that they were vague, irrelevant, unduly burdensome, and sought confidential information. The judge found that the requests were relevant and that the cross-defendant's objections were without merit. The judge ordered the cross-defendant to serve further responses and documents within 10 days and to pay monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,198 to the cross-complainant's counsel within 30 days.
