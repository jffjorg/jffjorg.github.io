And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the ex parte application to advance the hearing on motion to intervene filed by Reinsdorf. The application was denied because Reinsdorf failed to comply with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1202, which requires an applicant to make an affirmative factual showing in a declaration containing competent testimony based on personal knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte. Additionally, there is no pending emergency that would warrant advancing the motion, and at least 65 other motions have been waiting weeks to be heard. The motion will be heard as currently scheduled.
