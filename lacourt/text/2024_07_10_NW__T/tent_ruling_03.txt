 Case Number:  23VECV02505    Hearing Date:   July 10, 2024    Dept:  T Levi v Keyes 23VECV02505Tentative rulings Defendant’s motion to strike First Amended Complaint-GRANT.  The opposition was not considered because plaintiff’s counsel was to provide a declaration from Daniel Sanft attaching a copy of the overnight mail receipt, and proof of delivery or status of delivery (he stated in his 5/10/2024 proof of service that it was served by overnight delivery.).  He failed to do so, and defense denies receiving the opposition.By court order of 2/7/2024, the first amended complaint was to be served and filed no later than 20 days.  Because notice was given by the court by mail, an additional 5 days were added, which would make the due date 3/4/2024.  It was not served until 3/13/2024 and not filed until 3/14/2024 after the answer had been filed.  Therefore, the First Amended Complaint was late, and it is disregarded.  The ruling on the demurrer as to the original complaint stands:  Defendants Hyundai Motor America and Van Nuys-H, Inc. dba Keyes Hyundai of Van Nuys’s Demurrer to the Complaint is OVERRULED as to the eighth cause of action; SUSTAINED WITH 20 DAYS LEAVE TO AMEND as to the second cause of action; and SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND as to the fourth, fifth, seventh, tenth, twelfth, and thirteenth causes of action.  The Answer to the Complaint filed on 3/13/2024 stands. Plaintiff’s Demurrer to Answer: SUSTAINED WITH 20 DAYS LEAVE TO AMEND THE ANSWER. Plaintiff may demur to an answer, particularly as to affirmative defenses.  (Timberidge Enterps., Inc. v. City of Santa Rosa (1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 873, 879; see Hejmadi v. Amfac, Inc. (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 525, 535 [proper vehicle to test the sufficiency of an answer].) The affirmative defenses must do more than set forth bare legal conclusion.  Affirmative defenses must specify supporting facts. (FPI Devel., Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 384.) Allegations stating a legal conclusion (rather than pleading facts) are inadequate. (Berger v. California Ins. Guar. Assn. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 989, 1006; Jones v. Grewe (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 950, 954.)Here, the court finds that the demurrer is justified because there are no factual allegations supporting the bare legal conclusions.  The demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. The Second Affirmative Defense at page 19, lines 3-6, is uncertain in that it cannot be ascertained what was the “improper conduct of Plaintiff’, and what “applicable statutes” required notice: Sustained as to lack of facts which is alleged to have been improper conduct. The Sixth Affirmative Defense is uncertain in that on page 19, line 26, it cannot be ascertained who are the “persons or entities other than Defendants”, nor can it be ascertained how, when, or in what manner such persons or entitles were “reckless, careless and/or negligent”: Sustained.  No facts identified. The Twelfth Affirmative Defense fails to allege facts sufficient to state a defense; Sustained.

No facts alleged. The Thirty Third Affirmative Defense fails to allege facts sufficient to state a defense: Sustained. No facts alleged. The Thirty Fourth Affirmative Defense is uncertain in that on page 25 lines 24- 25, it cannot be ascertained in what action or proceeding was there a prior class action settlement, nor can it be ascertained how, when or in what manner, Plaintiff was given notice so as to prevent his being “opted out”: Sustained. No facts alleged. 14. The Thirty Sixth Affirmative Defense fails to allege facts sufficient to state a defense: Sustained. No facts alleged.
