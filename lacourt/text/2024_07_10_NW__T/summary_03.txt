And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of T Levi v Keyes. The Judge grants the defendant's motion to strike the First Amended Complaint, as the plaintiff's counsel failed to provide evidence of service and delivery of the opposition. The Judge also sustains the demurrer to the Answer, as the affirmative defenses lack sufficient facts to support the legal conclusions. The Judge orders the plaintiff to amend the Answer within 20 days. The Judge also rules on the demurrer to the original complaint, overruling the demurrer as to the eighth cause of action, sustaining it with 20 days leave to amend as to the second cause of action, and sustaining it without leave to amend as to the fourth, fifth, seventh, tenth, twelfth, and thirteenth causes of action.
