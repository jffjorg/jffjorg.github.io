This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a case between Farzan and Amin (plaintiffs) and Rodriguez (defendant). The judge grants defendant's motion to deem requests for admission admitted, which means that plaintiffs have admitted to having no evidence to support their claims. The judge also grants defendant's motion to compel answers to Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents, requiring plaintiffs to provide answers and documents within 20 days.

The judge grants defendant's request for judicial notice, taking notice of several documents related to the case. Additionally, the judge grants defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, dismissing the plaintiff's claims without leave to amend. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's claims fail to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action against the defendant. The defendant is ordered to submit a Judgment of Dismissal with Prejudice and provide notice of the court's rulings to the plaintiffs.
