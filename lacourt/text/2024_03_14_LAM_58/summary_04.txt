And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Defendant/Cross-Complainant Ehab Khela, represented by Attorney Jason Stone. The motion is granted. The judge finds that Attorney Stone has complied with the Rules of Court by filing all the necessary forms and providing a sufficient explanation for why he is seeking to be relieved as counsel. The judge notes that there has been a breakdown in attorney-client communication, making it difficult for Attorney Stone to adequately represent his client. The judge also finds that no prejudice will result from granting the motion, as the next hearing is a case management conference and trial has not been set.
