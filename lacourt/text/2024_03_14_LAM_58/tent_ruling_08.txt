            This
is an action arising from the operation of illegal commercial cannabis business.
The Complaint alleges violations of Health and Safety Code section 11570 and various
Los Angeles Municipal Code violations. 
 
            On
January 8, 2024, the Court entered default against Defendant Luis Arjon. Plaintiff
settled with Defendants Faustino Alva, Angie R. Alva, and Tina Alva. Does 1-25
have been dismissed. 
 
            Plaintiff
State of California now moves for default judgment against Defendant Luis Arjon.
The request for entry of default judgment is granted. 
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
seeks default judgment in the amount of $33,525,000 against Defendant Arjon and
for the issuance of an order permanently restraining and enjoining Defendant
Arjon from engaging in Commercial Cannabis Activity in the City of Los Angeles.

 
            Plaintiff
submits evidence that Defendant Arjon was operating a laboratory which processed
concentrated cannabis – that is, Defendant was engaging in Commercial Cannabis Activity
(CCA). (Jackson Decl., ¶¶ 4-16; Srbova Decl., ¶¶ 9-13.) Defendant’s operation
was illegal as he was engaging in CAA without the required license or temporary
approval. (Blake Decl., ¶¶ 3-6.) 
 
Further, Plaintiff
submits evidence that there were 1,340 separate violations based on Defendant
renting the property starting on January 1, 2019 and ending on September 2,
2022 (with the warehouse fire).[1]
(Alva Decl., ¶¶ 2-4.) Thus, the violations and the amount of civil penalties
has been adequately substantiated. 
 
Further, Plaintiff
does not seek prejudgment interest, costs or attorney fees. 
 
            Thus,
the only question before this Court then is whether Defendant had adequate notice
in the Complaint of the magnitude of the civil penalties sought. (National Diversified Services, Inc. v. Bernstein (1985) 168
Cal.App.3d 410, 418.) Based on the allegations in the body of the Complaint,
Defendant had fair warning that he may be liable for the maximum civil penalties
for the various violations of statutes and ordinances for each day of violation
or presence of the nuisance. (Compl., ¶¶ 6, 11, 23, 25, 31-32, 38, 42, 50, 55, Prayer
Decl., ¶ 6, 21, 30.)
 
Accordingly, the
request for entry of default judgment is granted.
