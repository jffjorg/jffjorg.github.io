And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the motions to set aside the default and default judgment filed by Defendant Jay Nieto, an individual dba Genesis 1 Auto Concepts. The Court finds that the motions are timely and have substantive merit. The Court grants the motions to set aside the default and default judgment and orders Defendant to file a separate copy of the answer within 10 days. The Court also sets a Case Management Conference for February 5, 2025, at 8:30 a.m.

The case involves a dispute between Plaintiff Garry Tindell and Defendant Jay Nieto, an individual dba Genesis 1 Auto Concepts, over a car repair. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant misrepresented the repairs made to his car and seeks to void the default judgment. Defendant claims that mistake, surprise, or neglect led to the default and default judgment and seeks to set aside the default and default judgment.

The Court finds that Defendant has shown good cause to set aside the default and default judgment, and the motions are granted. The Court also declines to address the issue of whether the default judgment is void due to extrinsic fraud, constructive service, and extrinsic mistake, as these issues were not raised by Defendant in the motions.
