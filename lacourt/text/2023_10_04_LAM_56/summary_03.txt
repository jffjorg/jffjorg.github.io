And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the Motion to Contest Good Faith Settlement filed by Angelus Waterproofing and Restoration, Inc. The motion contests the settlement agreement between West and Plaintiff, which provides for the payment of $200,000 to Plaintiff.

The Judge has considered the Tech-Bilt factors in evaluating the good faith of the settlement, including the rough approximation of Plaintiff's total recovery and West's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among Plaintiffs, the recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than he would if he were found liable after a trial, the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of settling defendants, and the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of non-settling defendants.

The Judge finds that West has made a prima facie showing of good faith that is supported by competent evidence, and that Angelus has failed to establish by sufficient evidence that the $200,000 evidenced by the West Settlement Agreement was so far "out of the ballpark" in relation to West's potential liability under the Tech-Bilt factors as to be inconsistent with the equitable objectives of CCP section 877.6.

The Judge therefore denies the Motion and grants the Application, finding that the West Settlement Agreement was entered into in good faith.
