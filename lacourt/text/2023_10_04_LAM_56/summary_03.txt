And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has made a tentative ruling on the Motion to Contest Good Faith Settlement filed by Angelus Waterproofing and Restoration, Inc. The motion contests the settlement agreement between West and Plaintiff, which provides for the payment of $200,000 to Plaintiff.

The Judge has considered the Tech-Bilt factors in evaluating the good faith of the settlement, including the rough approximation of Plaintiff's total recovery and West's proportionate liability, the amount paid in settlement, the allocation of settlement proceeds among Plaintiffs, the recognition that a settlor should pay less in settlement than he would if he were found liable after a trial, the financial conditions and insurance policy limits of settling defendants, and the existence of collusion, fraud, or tortious conduct aimed to injure the interests of non-settling defendants.

The Judge finds that West has made a prima facie showing of good faith that is supported by competent evidence, and that Angelus has failed to establish by sufficient evidence that the $200,000 evidenced by the West Settlement Agreement was so far "out of the ballpark" in relation to West's potential liability under the Tech-Bilt factors as to be inconsistent with the equitable objectives of CCP section 877.6.

The Judge therefore denies the Motion and grants the Application, finding that the West Settlement Agreement was entered into in good faith.

##  Tentative Ruling Summary: Case No. 21STCV24228

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiff:** Ted Waitt
* **Defendant:** Tyler Development Corporation and others
* **Cross-Defendant/Cross-Complainant:** Angelus Waterproofing and Restoration, Inc.
* **Cross-Defendant:** James West

**Case Description:**

This case involves alleged construction defects at a residential property. Ted Waitt (Plaintiff) alleges breach of contract and negligence against several parties, including James West (Defendant), who acted as a roofing and waterproofing consultant.

**Key Events:**

* West entered into a settlement agreement with Plaintiff for $200,000.
* Angelus Waterproofing and Restoration, Inc. (Angelus), a separate Cross-Defendant, contests the good faith of the settlement agreement.

**Arguments:**

* **West:** Argues the settlement is reasonable given his limited role as a consultant and lack of involvement in the alleged defects. He cites his insurance policy exclusion for professional services liability and argues he would likely be found not liable at trial. 
* **Angelus:** Contends the settlement amount is disproportionate to West's potential liability and lacks evidence to support its fairness.

**Court's Findings:**

* The Court finds that West has provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate the good faith of the settlement agreement.
* Angelus has failed to show that the settlement amount is "out of the ballpark" compared to West's potential liability.
* The Court denies Angelus's motion to contest the good faith settlement and grants West's application to have the settlement approved.

**Significant Statements:**

*  The Court acknowledges Angelus's lack of evidence regarding West's potential liability and its failure to address the potential liability of other defendants.

English text:
The Judge has considered the papers related to a motion to contest the good faith settlement of a case between Ted Waitt and Tyler Development Corporation, et al. The case is about alleged construction defects at a residential property. Plaintiff alleges that defendants, including James West, breached their contracts and were negligent in the performance of their duties in the construction of the property. West is a roofing and waterproofing consultant hired by Plaintiff for the project. West filed a Cross-Complaint for indemnity and contribution against various Cross-Defendants but did not name Angelus Waterproofing and Restoration, Inc. as a Cross-Defendant. Angelus was brought into the case on Cross-Complaints by ECM Exotic Pools & Spas and by Landry Design Group, Inc. Angelus then filed its own Cross-Complaint but did not name West as a Cross-Defendant. West filed a Notice of Settlement indicating that he and Plaintiff had entered into a settlement agreement (the “West Settlement Agreement”) and an application to determine good faith settlement (the “Application”). Angelus filed a motion to contest good faith settlement (the “Motion”) arguing that the West Settlement Agreement was not entered into in good faith and does not reflect West’s proportion of liability for Plaintiff’s damages. The Judge overruled Angelus’s objections to the Declaration of Katie Brach, deposition testimony of Ted Waitt, and the Declaration of Gerald A. Schneider. The Judge found that the West Settlement Agreement was entered into in good faith and denied the Motion and granted the Application.
