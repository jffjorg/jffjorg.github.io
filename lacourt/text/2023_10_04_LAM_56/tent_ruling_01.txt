MOVING
PARTY: Plaintiff
 
RESPONDING
PARTY: Defendants Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC and Sonic Santa Monica M Inc. (collectively,
“Defendants”)
            
            The Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply
papers.  
 
BACKGROUND 
            Plaintiff’s complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges: (1)
violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act; (2) breach of the implied
warranty of merchantability under the Song-Beverly Act; and (3) breach of
express warranties pursuant to Commercial Code section 2313. 
 
Plaintiff
filed a Notice of Settlement on April 26, 2023. 
On July 14, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for attorney’s fees (the
“Motion”) on the grounds that Plaintiff is entitled to reasonable attorney’s
fees and costs as the prevailing plaintiff in a Song-Beverly Act action.  The Motion requests attorney’s fees in the
amount of $248,861.25 (applying a multiplier from $165,907.50) and costs in the
amount of $9,793.42.[1] 
 
DISCUSSION
A
prevailing party in an action under the Song-Beverly Act may be entitled to
attorney’s fees.  (Civ. Code § 1794,
subd. (d); see also CCP § 1032, subd.
(a)(4).)  Attorney’s fees ordinarily
include compensation for all hours reasonably spent, including those necessary
to establish and defend the claims.  (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621,
639.)  The party moving for attorney’s
fees has the burden of establishing entitlement to an award and documenting the
appropriate hours expended and hourly rates. 
(Christian Research Institute v.
Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1320.) 
Where a case is premised on a contingent fee agreement it is appropriate
to award reasonable attorney’s fees for time reasonably expended by the
attorney.  (Glaviano v. Sacramento City Unified School Dist. (2018) 22
Cal.App.5th 744, 755.)  If the time
expended or the monetary charge being made for the time expended are not
reasonable under all the circumstances, then the court must take this into
account and award attorney fees in a lesser amount.  (Nightingale
v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104.) 
 
In
determining what constitutes a reasonable compensation for an attorney who has
rendered services in connection with a legal proceeding, the court may and
should consider the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount
involved, the skill required and the skill employed in handling the litigation,
the attention given, the success of the attorney’s efforts, his learning, his
age and his experience in the particular type of work demanded.  (Church
of Scientology v. Wollersheim (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 628, 659.)  An award of attorney fees may be based on
counsel’s declarations, without production of detailed time records.  (Raining
Data Corp. v. Barrenechea (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1375.)  The verified time statements of attorneys, as
officers of the court, are entitled to credence in the absence of a clear
indication the records are erroneous.  (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California
State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396.)  
 
             A court awards
attorney’s fees based on the “lodestar” method which is “the number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.”  (PLCM
Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)  The trial court has broad authority to
determine the amount of a reasonable fee. 
(Id.)  The loadstar figure may be adjusted, based on
a consideration of factors specific to the case, in order to fix the fee at the
fair market value for the legal services provided.  (Id.)  Generally, the reasonable hourly rate used
for the lodestar calculation is that prevailing in the community for similar
work.  (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010)
188 Cal.App.4th 603, 616.)  Nevertheless,
where an attorney has been awarded attorney’s fees for comparable work at
comparable hourly rates in other actions, the hourly rate will be deemed
reasonable.  (Goglin v. BMW of North America, LLC (2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 462,
473-74.)  Where a defendant does not
produce evidence contradicting the reasonableness of plaintiff’s counsel’s
hourly rates, the Court will deem an attorney’s hourly rate reasonable.  (Id.
at 473.)  
 
            In support of the Motion, Plaintiff provides evidence of his
counsel’s billing records.  (See Declaration
of Steven A. Simons (“Simons Decl.”), Exhibit A.)  Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly rate was $650
per hour in 2019; $750 per hour for entries beginning on January 8, 2020; and
$850 beginning in January 2023.  (See Simons Decl. ¶ 6, Exhibit A.)  Plaintiff’s billed hours also reflect work
performed by a paralegal whose hourly rate was $175 per hour for work performed
up to 2021 and $225 per hour beginning in 2021. 
(See Simons Decl. ¶ 21.)   The
Court accepts Plaintiff’s counsel’s hourly fees as appropriate but does not
find that Plaintiff has demonstrated that the case involved special issues that
warrant a lodestar multiplier. 
 
Reasonableness of Billing
Entries
Where
a party is challenging the reasonableness of attorney’s fees as excessive that
party must attack itemized billing with evidence that the fees claimed were not
appropriate or obtain the declaration of an attorney with expertise in the
procedural and substantive law to demonstrate that the fees claimed were
unreasonable.  (Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee
Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 563-64.) 
A reduced award might be fully justified by a general observation that
an attorney overlitigated a case or submitted a padded bill or that the
opposing party has stated valid objections. 
(Gorman v. Tassajara Development
Corp. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 44, 101.) 
Attorney billing records are given a presumption of credibility.  (Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 396.)
            Defendants
argue that Plaintiff’s billing records are somewhat inflated by the use of
block billing and include entries for ministerial tasks that should not be
compensated.[2]  The Court agrees that the billing records
submitted with the Simons Declaration include entries that combine multiple
tasks and/or ministerial tasks.  (See,
e.g., April 4, 2-23 entries.)  The
Court therefore finds it appropriate to reduce Plaintiff’s overall recovery by $9,750,
which represents 15 hours at counsel’s original $650 per hour rate, for a total
award of attorney’s fees of $156,157.50, plus costs.
 
            The Court therefore GRANTS the Motion in part in
accordance with the above. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar.
