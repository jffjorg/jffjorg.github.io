##  Summary of the Tentative Ruling 

This tentative ruling addresses Plaintiff MOHAMMAD IMAM's motion to compel discovery responses from Defendant 4 Star Motel. 

**Background:** 
Plaintiff filed a lawsuit against Defendant alleging 11 causes of action stemming from an employment relationship.  Plaintiff sent discovery requests to Defendant, but Defendant failed to respond within the deadline. Plaintiff then filed a motion to compel responses.

**Defendant's Response:** Defendant argues that they did provide responses to Plaintiff's discovery requests, but the responses were submitted after the motion to compel was filed.

**Judge's Decision:**

* **Motion to Compel:** Because Defendant has now provided the discovery responses, the motion to compel is considered moot.
* **Monetary Sanctions:** The judge finds that Defendant's late response to discovery warranted sanctions. The judge awards Plaintiff $1,900 in sanctions, representing four hours of attorney time spent drafting the motion.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel responses to discovery requests propounded by the plaintiff against the defendant, 4 Star Motel. The plaintiff had filed a motion to compel responses after the defendant failed to serve timely responses to the discovery requests.

The judge also cited case law, including Leach v. Superior Court and Moran v. Oso Valley Greenbelt Assn., to support its ruling.
