And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion to compel responses from the plaintiff, Mohammad Imam, to the defendant, 4 Star Motel. The plaintiff had propounded discovery requests on May 2, 2023, and the defendant failed to serve timely responses. Although the defendant claims it provided responses on August 30, 2023, the motion is now moot as the defendant has complied with the discovery requests. The judge awards the plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of $1900 for the time spent drafting the motion. The defendant and counsel are jointly ordered to pay this amount within 20 days.
