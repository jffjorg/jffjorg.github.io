And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has made a tentative ruling on the Motion to Quash Service of Summons filed by Cosentino Group, S.A. The court finds that the service of summons was improperly served and grants the motion. The court also denies the request to order Cosentino Group to comply with jurisdictional discovery requests.

The court's decision is based on the fact that Cosentino Group is a Spanish corporation with no minimum contacts with California, and the service of summons was attempted via personal service on Eduardo Cosentino in Canada and via Federal Express to Cosentino Group's corporate headquarters in Spain, which did not comply with the provisions of the Hague Service Convention.

The court also notes that the plaintiffs failed to show that service on Cosentino Group was valid under article 10(a) of the Convention, and that the granting of a continuance for jurisdictional discovery lies in the discretion of the trial court.
