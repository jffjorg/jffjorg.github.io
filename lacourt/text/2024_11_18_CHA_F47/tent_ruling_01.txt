CLIENT: Plaintiff Jose Luis Chavez
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order relieving Koorosh K.

RULING: 
 
On 9/13/24, attorney Koorosh K. Shahrokh filed the
instant motion seeking an order relieving attorney Shahrokh as counsel for
Plaintiff Jose Luis Chavez (Plaintiff) in this action on the ground that the
attorney and client have irreconcilable differences.  
 
The motion was originally scheduled for hearing on 4/24/25.  The proof of service for the motion indicates
that on 9/14/24, the motion was served by U.S. Mail on Plaintiff (the client)
and “County of Los Angeles.”  (See
Proof of Service filed on 9/16/24).  The
address where defendant “County of Los Angeles” was served is that of defense
counsel.  Id.  The name of defense counsel and/or defense
counsel’s firm is not set forth in the original proof of service filed on 9/16/24.  Id.
 
On 9/25/24, on the Court’s own motion, the hearing on the
instant motion was advanced to 9/25/24 and continued to 11/18/24.  (See 9/25/24 Minute Order, p.1).  Plaintiff’s counsel was ordered to give
notice.  (Id, p.2).  On 10/11/24, Plaintiff’s counsel filed a
Notice of Ruling regarding the 9/25/24 orders. 
The proof of service attached to the Notice of Ruling indicates that on
10/11/24 it was served by U.S. Mail and email on defense counsel and Plaintiff.  (See Notice of Ruling filed on
10/11/24).  
 
If defense counsel concedes receipt of the motion based
on the 9/14/24 service by mail and/or has no objection to the granting of the
motion, it will be granted upon attorney Shahrokh including Plaintiff’s telephone
number in number 6 of the proposed Order. 

 
If not, the hearing on the motion will be continued to
allow proper service of the motion on defense counsel and/or inclusion of
Plaintiff’s telephone number in the proposed Order.  In such case, Plaintiff will also have to be
served with notice of the continued hearing date.
