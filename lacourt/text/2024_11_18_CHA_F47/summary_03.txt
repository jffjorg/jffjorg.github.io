And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the demurrer filed by the plaintiff, Derek Jones, to the defendant's first amended answer. The demurrer asserts that the answer does not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense and is uncertain and unintelligible. The court has ruled that the demurrer is overruled. The court finds that the defendant's first amended answer provides the plaintiff with sufficient notice to prepare his case and that any defects in the answer do not affect the plaintiff's substantial rights. The court also notes that the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant will be unable to rely on each of the affirmative defenses set forth in the answer. Any uncertainties regarding the affirmative defenses can be resolved through discovery.
