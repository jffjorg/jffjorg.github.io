COMPROMISE
 
Petition filed on 10/23/24.
 
MINOR: Zahir Bey-Gray
GAL: Shauntae Edmond Gray (parent)
DEFENDANTS: Akhtar Ali Gorsi and
RSB Transport LLC
 
SUMMARY OF ACTION: This action arises out of a
motor vehicle accident that occurred on 7/10/22 on the Southbound 5 Freeway in
Burbank, California.  Minor was a
passenger in a vehicle driven by Shana Marcella Daley and also occupied by
Shauntae Edmond Gray and Anageon Bey-Gray.  Defendant Akhtar Ali Gorsi lost control of the
truck he was operating and collided with the vehicle that Minor was a passenger
in, as well as a second vehicle driven by Ana Elizabeth Garcia and occupied by
Samantha Morales and Adrian Garcia.
 
Minor suffered pain in his neck which radiated to his
upper extremities, pain to his upper and lower back and avoidance of riding in
cars due to anxiety from the collision.  Minor
received chiropractic treatment at Hess Rehab and Chiro Center on 8/4/22.  Minor was under the care of Reekesh Patel, MD
at CA Sports and Spine Center from 7/27/22 through 1/20/23.  Minor got MRIs done at Prohealth Advanced
Imaging on 8/16/22.  The minor has
completely recovered.
 
SETTLEMENT: Defendants RSB Transport LLC/Akhtar
Ali Gorsi to pay $12,145.91.
 
MEDICAL EXPENSES: $9,782.00 (total); $7,182.00
(reduction), $2,600.00 (to be paid from settlement)
 
ATTORNEY FEES: $0
 
COSTS: $0
 
AMOUNT TO BE PAID TO MINOR: $9,545.91 to be
deposited in a blocked account.  
 
RULING: 
 
 
No.18.b.(2) in the petition incorrectly lists $12,145.91
as the amount to be deposited in a blocked account.  It should be $9,545.91 after the medical
expenses are deducted.  The correct
amount is set forth in the accompanying proposed orders.  
 
Upon the correction of the foregoing error, the petition
will be granted.
