The motion was filed on September 13, 2024, and was originally scheduled for hearing on April 24, 2025. The judge has advanced the hearing to November 18, 2024, and continued it to allow for proper service of the motion on defense counsel.

If defense counsel concedes receipt of the motion or has no objection to its granting, the judge will grant the motion, provided that attorney Shahrokh includes plaintiff's telephone number in the proposed order. If defense counsel objects, the hearing will be continued to allow for proper service of the motion and to include plaintiff's telephone number in the proposed order.
