SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of the joint ownership by Plaintiff
Derek Jones (Plaintiff) and Defendant Leticia M. Flores (Defendant) of real
property located at 10261 Calvin Avenue, Northridge, California 91324-1114 (the
Property).  The parties cannot agree on
how to divide the Property.  Therefore,
on 6/25/24, Plaintiff filed this action for partition.  On 8/26/24, Defendant answered the complaint
and on 9/20/24 Defendant filed her First Amended Answer to the complaint.  
 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the
issues Plaintiff has with Defendant’s First Amended Answer, on 9/30/24,
Plaintiff filed the subject demurrer to the entire First Amended Answer which
asserts the following affirmative defenses: (1) Lawful Conduct, (2) No Damages
Suffered, (3) Waiver, (4) Good Faith, (5) Privilege (6) Consent, (7) Equity,
(8) Estoppel, 
(9) Laches and (10) Reservation of Rights.  Defendant has opposed the demurrer and
Plaintiff has filed a reply to the opposition. 

 
ANALYSIS
 
A party against whom an answer has been filed may object
by demurrer based on the grounds that the answer does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a defense and the answer is uncertain which includes the
answer being ambiguous and unintelligible, among other grounds.  See CCP 430.20(a), (b).   
 
Pleadings are to be liberally construed with a view
toward substantial justice between the parties. CCP 452.  The Court finds that Defendant’s First Amended
Answer provides Plaintiff with sufficient notice so that Plaintiff may prepare his
case and any defects in the First Amended Answer do not affect Plaintiff’s
substantial rights.  See Harris
(2013) 56 C4th 203, 239-240; FPI Development, Inc. (1991) 231
CA3d 367, 384-385.  Plaintiff has failed
to establish that Defendant will be unable to rely on each of the Affirmative
Defenses set forth in the First Amended Answer.  Any uncertainties regarding the affirmative
defenses can be resolved through discovery.
 
With regard to the 10th Affirmative Defense
which indicates that Defendant reserves her right to assert additional rights/defenses,
Defendant must follow proper procedures for seeking leave to amend the First
Amended Answer if she wishes to add additional affirmative defenses in the
future.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The demurrer is overruled.
