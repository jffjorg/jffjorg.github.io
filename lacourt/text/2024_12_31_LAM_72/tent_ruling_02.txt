Plaintiffs Cynthia
Ross (“Ross”) and Carla Monroe (“Monroe”) (together, “Plaintiffs”) move for an
award of attorney’s fees and costs related to terminated arbitration
proceedings against Defendant Clare | Matrix, Inc. (“Defendant”) in the total
amount of $11,918.91, including (1) $8,250.00 in attorney fees and costs,
(2) $68.91 in arbitration related costs, and (3) $3,600.00 in attorney’s fees
related to the current motion. (Notice of Motion, pp. i-ii; Civ. Code § 1281.99.)

 
The Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for attorney’s
fees in the requested amount of $11,918.91. Defendant shall pay this amount to
Plaintiff within 60 days.
 
Background
 
            Plaintiffs Ross and Monroe allege
they were employed by Defendant as licensed vocational nurses. (Complaint, ¶¶
16, 26.) Counsel for Defendant declares that Defendant 
is
a non-profit organization offering community alcohol and substance
rehabilitation services. (Declaration of Victoria J. Ramirez (“Decl. of Ramirez”),
¶ 2.) Ross’s employment term with Defendant was between June 2020 and May 2023.
(Complaint, ¶ 16.) Ross alleges that she was placed on FMLA leave for a
disability between April 2022 and September 2022, and Defendant wrongfully
terminated her employment without engaging in the interactive process. (id.
¶ 23-25.) Monroe’s employment term with Defendant was from November 2021 to May
2023. (id., ¶ 26.) Monroe alleges that she reported job-incurred back
and hip injuries to Defendant, and Defendant wrongfully terminating her after
not providing medical attention or engaging in the interactive process. (id.,
¶¶ 28-31.)  
 
            On December 7, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed a complaint against Defendant asserting seven (7) causes of action
against Defendant: (1) discrimination (Gov. Code, §12940 et seq.), (2) retaliation
(Gov. Code, §12940 et seq.), (3) failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation
(Gov. Code, §12940(k)), (4) failure to provide reasonable accommodation (Gov.
Code, §12940 et seq.), (5) failure to engage in good faith interactive process
(Gov. Code, §12940 et seq.), (6) declaratory judgment, and (7) wrongful
termination, in violation of public policy. (Declaration of Diana Karapetyan
(“Decl. of Karapetyan”), ¶ 2.)
 
            On April 15, 2024, the Court granted
the parties’ Joint Stipulation to Stay Action and Arbitrate Plaintiffs’ Claims.
(4/15/2024 Min. Order.)
 
On
May 1, 2024, Plaintiffs’ demand for arbitration was submitted to Signature
Resolution. (Decl. of Karapetyan ¶ 4.) The parties proceeded to arbitration
with Signature Resolution with Judge Richard Stone (Retired) as
arbitrator.  (Declaration of Victoria J.
Ramirez (“Decl. of Ramirez”), ¶ 6, Exh. D.)  On May 21, 2024 Defendant timely paid
Signature Resolution the one-time administrative fee. (Decl. of Ramirez, ¶ 5, Exh.
C.) Signature Resolution required the payment of initial arbitration fees by
June 27, 2024. (Decl. of Karapetyan, ¶ 5.) Plaintiffs contend that by July 16,
2024, Defendant had not paid those fees, delaying the initial arbitration
management conference. (ibid., ¶ 6.) On August 7, 2024, counsel for
Plaintiffs informed counsel for Defendant of their intention to file a motion
to terminate arbitration and request attorney fees with the Court pursuant to §
1281.97. (id., ¶¶ 8-9.) 
 
On
September 19, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion to terminate
arbitration. (see 9/19/24 Min. Order RE: Motion to Terminate Order to Arbitrate
and Proceed in State Court pursuant to Civ. Code § 1281.97.)
 
On
October 24, 2024, Plaintiffs filed this motion to award attorney fees and
costs. Defendant filed an opposition on December 17, 2024. On December 20,
2024, Plaintiffs filed a reply brief. The motion hearing is set for December
31, 2024.
 
Legal Standard
 
            Attorney’s fees may be recovered
as costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law.  (Civ. Code §
1033.5(a)(10).) 
Under Code of Civil
Procedure¿section 1281.97, subdivision (a), where a consumer arbitration
requires the drafting party to pay certain fees and costs before the
arbitration can proceed, and the fees or costs to initiate an
arbitration¿proceeding are not paid within 30 days after the due date, the
drafting party is in material breach of the arbitration¿agreement and waives
the right to compel arbitration.  If the
drafting party materially breaches the agreement by not paying the requisite
fees, the consumer “may do either of the following: (1) [w]ithdraw¿the claim
from arbitration¿and proceed¿in a court of appropriate jurisdiction” or (2)
“[c]ompel arbitration in which the drafting party shall pay reasonable
attorney’s fees and costs related to the arbitration.”¿¿(Civ. Code §¿1281.97(b)(l)-(2).)
 
If the “consumer
proceeds with an action in a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the court shall
impose sanctions on the drafting party in accordance with Section 1281.99.”¿¿(Civ,
Code §¿1281.97(d).)¿¿Section 1281.99¿provides:¿¿ 
¿ 
“(a) The court shall impose a monetary
sanction against a drafting party that materially breaches an arbitration
agreement pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1281.97 or subdivision (a) of
Section 1281.98, by ordering the drafting party to pay the reasonable expenses,
including attorney's fees and costs, incurred by the employee or consumer as a
result of the material breach.”¿ 
 
“In an employment…
arbitration that requires… that the drafting party pay certain fees and costs
during the pendency of an arbitration proceeding, if the fees or costs
required to continue the arbitration proceeding are not paid within 30 days
after the due date, the drafting party is in material breach of the arbitration
agreement, is in default of the arbitration, and waives its right to compel
the employee… to proceed with that arbitration as a result of the material
breach.” (Civ. Code §1281.98(a)(1) (emphasis added).)
 
“If the drafting party materially breaches the
arbitration agreement and is in default…, the employee… may
unilaterally elect to… [w]ithdraw the claim from
arbitration and proceed in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.” (Civ. Code
§1281.98(b)(1) (emphasis added).)
 
“If the employee… withdraws the claim
from arbitration and proceeds in a court of appropriate jurisdiction
pursuant to [Section 1281.98(b)(1)]… [t]he employee or consumer may bring a
motion, or a separate action, to recover all attorney’s fees and all costs
associated with the abandoned arbitration proceeding [where] recovery of
arbitration fees, interest, and related attorney’s fees shall be without regard
to any findings on the merits in the underlying action or arbitration [and]
[t]he court shall impose sanctions on the drafting party in accordance with
Section 1281.99.” (C.C.P. §1281.98(c)(1),(2) (emphasis added).)
 
“The court shall impose a monetary sanction
against a drafting party that materially breaches an arbitration agreement
pursuant to [Section 1281.98(a)], by ordering the drafting party to pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees and costs, incurred by the
employee… as a result of the material breach.” (Civ. Code §1281.99(a).)
 
 
Discussion
 
A.   
Entitlement to Fees and Costs 
            Plaintiffs move the
Court for attorney’s fees and costs from Defendant on the grounds that Plaintiffs
prevailed in their motion to terminate arbitration. (Motion, p. 1.) Plaintiffs contend
that despite stipulating to arbitration, Defendant’s failure to pay the initial
arbitration filing fees pursuant to Civ. Code section 12981.97, entitles them
to an award of attorney fees and costs incurred in bringing such motions. (Decl. of Karapetyan, ¶¶ 8-9.) 
            Defendant concedes to its material breach of the
arbitration agreement as of July 26, 2024, when it missed the deadline to pay
the initial arbitration fees. (Opposition, p. 2.) Counsel for Defendant represents
that it missed the 30-day payment deadline because Defendant is a non-profit
organization that could not afford to pay the arbitrator’s retainer fee in a
single payment. (Decl. of Ramirez, ¶ 2, Exh. E; Civ. Code § 1281.98(a)(1).) Defendant
requested to enter a payment plan for the arbitration fees to Signature
Resolution, and Signature Resolution instructed them to reach an agreement with
counsel for Plaintiffs. (id., at ¶¶ 7-8, Exh. F.) Defendant submitted
this request to Plaintiffs’ counsel and claims that Plaintiffs did not respond
to this request. (Opposition, p. 1.) On August 7, Plaintiffs informed
counsel for Defendant of their intention to file the instant motion. (Decl. of
Karapetyan, ¶¶ 8-9.)
Defendants do not dispute that as
a general matter Plaintiffs are entitled to recover fees and costs.  As a matter of law, Defendant’s failure to
pay arbitration costs constituted a material breach of the arbitration
agreement, placed Defendant in default of the arbitration, and waived
Defendant’s right to compel Plaintiffs to proceed with the arbitration. (Civ.
Code § 1281.92(a).) Further, as a matter of law, Plaintiffs had the statutory
right to withdraw their claims from arbitration, proceed with their claims in
court, bring a motion to recover all attorney’s fees and all costs associated
with the abandoned arbitration proceeding, and obtain a court order imposing
monetary sanctions on Defendant.  (Civ. Code § 1281.98(b)(1),
(c)(1)-(2).)  Defendant’s attempts to settle payment pursuant to a payment
plan do not excuse Defendant’s failure to pay the arbitration fees and did not
prohibit Plaintiff from terminating arbitration proceedings.
Accordingly,
Plaintiffs are entitled to recover the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees and costs from Defendant’s material breach.
B.     Reasonableness
Plaintiffs
seek attorney’s fees from the inception of the case including the joint stipulation
to arbitration, the Court’s grant of Plaintiffs’ motion to terminate
arbitration, through the filing of the instant motion. (Motion, p. 4.) Specifically,
Plaintiffs seek to recover a total amount of $11,918.91, including (1)
$8,250.00 in attorney fees and costs, (2) $68.91 in arbitration related costs,
and (3) $3,600.00 in attorney’s fees related to the instant motion. (Notice of
Motion, pp. i-ii.)
The fee setting inquiry in
California ordinarily begins with the “lodestar” method, i.e., the number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.  A
computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is
fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorney’s fee award. 
The lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on factors specific to the
case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided.  (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49
 
No
specific findings reflecting the court’s calculations are required.  The
record need only show that the attorney fees were awarded according to the
“lodestar” or “touchstone” approach.  The court’s focus in evaluating the
facts should be to provide a fee award reasonably designed to completely
compensate attorneys for the services provided.  The starting point for
this determination is the attorney’s time records.  (Horsford v. Board
of Trustees of Calif. State Univ. (2005) 132¿Cal.App.4th 359, 395-397 [verified
time records entitled to credence absent clear indication they are
erroneous].)  However, California case law permits fee awards in the
absence of detailed time sheets.  (Sommers v. Erb (1992) 2
Cal.App.4th 1644, 1651; Dunk v. Ford Motor Co. (1996) 48¿Cal.App.4th
1794, 1810; Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th
99, 103.)  An experienced trial judge is in a position to assess the value
of the professional services rendered in his or her court.  (Id.; Serrano
v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49; Wershba v. Apple Computer, Inc.
(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 224, 255.)
Counsel
for Plaintiffs allege that 21.5 hours were incurred working on this case. (Evidence
Package, Exhibit B.) The hourly rates are summarized for Plaintiffs’ counsel as
follows: (i) Ramin R, Younessi has been practicing in specialized litigation for
30 years and as of January 2024, his hourly rate is $1,300 (Declaration of
Younessi (“Decl. of Younessi”), ¶¶ 3, 7), (ii) Heather N. Phillips, the lead
attorney in this case, bills at an hourly rate of $600 (Declaration of Phillips
(“Decl. of Phillips”), ¶¶ 11, 13), (iii) Diana Karapetyan and (iv) Charles
Casado bill at an hourly rate of $400.00 (Decl. of Karapetyan, ¶ 16; Motion, p.
5), and (iv) the paralegal(s), legal assistant(s) and law clerk(s) in this case
bill at a rate of $250 per hour. (Motion, p. 5.) Plaintiffs include a history
of court approvals and argue that the hourly rates are reasonable in the
community. (Motion, p. 5.)  
Defendant
do not challenge the hourly rates, but argue that the fees are unreasonable for
several other reasons.  First, Defendant
argues that it is improper for Plaintiff requests $5,305 in attorney’s fees
incurred prior to its breach of the arbitration agreement. (Opposition,
p. 2.)  However, that represents fee
amounts that were spent by Plaintiff at the early stage of the arbitration that
were entirely wasted because of Defendant’s breach.  Defendant’s breach therefore can be said to
have caused the requested fees.  Moreover,
the statute specifically allows Plaintiff to bring a motion “to recover all attorney’s fees and all costs
associated with the abandoned arbitration proceeding.” (C.C.P.
§1281.98(c)(1),(2) (emphasis added).)  
 
Next,
Defendant complains about Plaintiffs’ block-billing, asserting for example that
Plaintiffs fail to describe how the time billed by administrative staff was
“reasonably spent” or “necessary.” (Opposition, p. 4.)  The Court has reviewed the billing statements
and finds them adequate in the context of this case.  In addition, the Court considers the fees to
be reasonable.
 
For
these reasons, the Court grants the motion.
