Summary:

The judge has declined to relate and consolidate 18 separate actions filed by 203 plaintiffs against E&S Ring Management Corp. for violating the Investigative Consumer Reporting Agencies Act (ICRAA). The judge found that the cases are not related because they involve different parties, properties, facts, and claims for damages. The judge also noted that the cases do not require substantial duplication of judicial resources and that the California Rules of Court do not require a single court to adjudicate all ICRAA claims against a particular defendant. The motion to relate and consolidate the cases is therefore denied.
