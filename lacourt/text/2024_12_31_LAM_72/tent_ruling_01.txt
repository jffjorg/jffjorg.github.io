Defendants Xenofon
Ted Stavropoulos (“Stavropoulos”) moves for an award of attorney’s fees against
Plaintiffs Jay Hooper (“Hooper”), UW International Corp. (“UW”), and Crown
Estate Holding LLC (“CEH”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) in the amount of
$394,264.17.
 
The Court GRANTS
the motion in the amount of $354,587.00.
 
Background
 
            This case relates to a business venture whereby
Stavropoulos, John Alexander Rigas (“Rigas”), and Hooper (collectively, the
“Principals”) formed Mission n95 Holdings, LLC (“Mission”) in the spring of
2020 to procure and provide personal protective equipment during the Covid-19
pandemic.  Plaintiffs subsequently filed this lawsuit against Defendants
Rigas and Mission (collectively, the “Rigas Defendants”), and Stavropoulos
(collectively with Rigas and Mission, “Defendants”). 
 
The Court has
recited background facts relating to this dispute in both the prior attorney’s
fee order (10/31/2024 Minute Order) and the order granting summary judgment. (8/21/2024
Minute Order; 6/21/2024 Minute Order.) 
As described more fully in those orders, on June 11, 2020, the
Principals executed an agreement (the “General Agreement”).  Near the end of December 2020, the Principals
executed several agreements (collectively, the “December Agreements”): 
 
1. The Mutual General Release Agreement
(“Mutual General Release”), dated December 29, 2020, signed by Hooper, his wife
Rebecca Hooper (consenting to her husband’s execution of the agreement),
Stavropoulos, and Rigas individually and on Mission’s behalf; 
 
2. The Rescission Agreement, dated
December 29, 2020, signed by the same four people in their same capacities as
the Mutual General Release; 
 
3. The First Amendment to General
Agreement (“Amended General Agreement”), dated December 29, 2020, signed by
Hooper on behalf of UW and Rigas on behalf of Mission; and  
 
4. The Employment Agreement, which was
dated as of May 6, 2020, signed by Rigas on behalf of Mission and Hooper as an
Employee of Mission. 
 
The Rigas
Defendants moved for summary judgment on February 15, 2024 (the “Prior
Motion”). On June 21, 2024, the Court issued an order granting the Rigas
Defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the General Release
in the December Agreements barred Plaintiffs’ claims. 
 
On July 5, 2024,
judgment was entered for the Rigas Defendants and against Plaintiffs. 
 
On August 21,
2024, the Court granted Stavropoulos’ motion for summary judgment on similar
grounds. Judgment was entered for Stavropoulos and against Plaintiffs on
September 3, 2024. 
 
On November 1,
2024, Stavropoulos filed this motion for attorney’s fees. On December 17, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed an opposition. On December 23, 2024, Stavropoulos filed a
reply.
 
Legal Standard
 
“In any action
on a contract, where the contract specifically provides that attorney's fees
and costs, which are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either
to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is
determined to be the party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the
party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable
attorney's fees in addition to other costs. 
 
Where a contract
provides for attorney's fees, as set forth above, that provision shall be
construed as applying to the entire contract, unless each party was represented
by counsel in the negotiation and execution of the contract, and the fact of
that representation is specified in the contract. 
 
Reasonable
attorney's fees shall be fixed by the court, and shall be an element of the
costs of suit.” 
 
(Civ. Code, §
1717, subd. (a).) 
 
Discussion
 
Entitlement to Fees 
            The
Mutual General Release, the Rescission Agreement, and the Employment Agreement
each provide for the award of attorney’s fees to the prevailing party in an
action to enforce the agreement. (Brown Decl., ¶ 3, Ex. A, ¶ 5 [Mutual General
Release]; ¶ 4, Ex. B, ¶ 17 [Recission Agreement]; ¶ 5, Ex. C, ¶ 20 [Hooper
Employment Agreement].) 
The General Agreement
does not. Instead, the General Agreement provided that the parties would pay
they own costs and expenses, including legal fees, associated with the General
Agreement. 
Plaintiffs filed suit
under the Operating Agreement and the General Agreement, among other things.
However, it was the December Agreements—including the Mutual General Release, Recission
Agreement, and Employment Agreement—that were dispositive. Defendants
successfully obtained summary judgment in this case by enforcing the claim
waivers created by the December Agreements. Thus, this case was an action to
enforce the December Agreements. As a result, parties bound by the December
Agreements are subject to their attorney’s fees provisions. 
Hooper does not contest
that he is bound by the December Agreements but rather contests the
reasonableness of the fees that Stavropoulos is now seeking. 
UW and CEH 
            In their opposition,
Plaintiffs reincorporate their arguments stated in their opposition to Rigas
Defendants’ motion for attorney fees. Thus, Plaintiffs again contest that the
instant motion should not be enforced as to UW and CEH.
            For
similar reasons that were addressed in the Court’s October 31, 2024 order, the
Court concludes that Stavropoulos is entitled to an award of attorney fees
against Plaintiffs, including UW and CEH. (Oct. 31, 2024 Order.) The Court has
concluded that UW and CEH were bound by the December Agreements as alter egos
of Hooper, and because the Mutual General Release states in pertinent part that
it “shall
be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto, their …
agents, … alter egos and assigns,” the instant motion can be enforced against
UW and CEH. (Brown Decl., Ex. 1 at ¶ 18.)
Amount of Fees
The attorney bears the
burden of proof as to “reasonableness” of any fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5(c)(5).) This burden requires competent evidence as to the nature and
value of the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d
553, 559.) A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima facie evidence
that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily incurred. (See Hadley
v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.) “In challenging attorney fees as
excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the
challenging party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient
argument and citations to the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are
excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v.
Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys.,
Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550,
564.)¿¿ 
In determining whether
the requested attorney’s fees are “reasonable,” the Court’s “first step
involves the lodestar figure—a calculation based on the number of hours
reasonably expended multiplied by the lawyer’s hourly rate. The lodestar figure
may then be adjusted, based on consideration of facts specific to the case, in
order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.”
(Gorman v. Tassajara Development Corp. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 770, 774
[internal citations omitted].) 
Here, Stavropoulos is
requesting attorney fees in the amount of $394,264.17. 
The Court concludes that
the documented time that counsel for Stavropoulos spent in defending this
action is reasonable. This action has lasted for about three years.  Stavropoulos was required to produce and
review discovery, take and attend depositions, and pursue his successful motion
for summary judgment.  Stavropoulos’s
requested fees are significantly less than the fees approved by the Court for
the Rigas Defendants.
Plaintiffs do not
challenge any specific item of attorney’s fees as unreasonable. However, they
do point out a math error in Stavropoulos’s motion. Though Stavropoulos requested
a fee amount of $394,264.17, he listed attorney hours that come out to less
than that amount.  In paragraph 20 of the
11/1/2024 declaration of Nancy C. Brown supporting the fee motion, Attorney
Brown lists the following hours, albeit without the calculation of the dollar
amount.

(Brown Decl., ¶¶ 20-22.) This is significantly less than Stavropoulos’s
requested amount.
            In Reply, however, Stavropoulos
points out that the amounts above are an error. 
Stavropoulos argues that the itemized bills attached to the declaration
show 357.52 (not 123.2) hours for Ms. Nancy Brown and 11.75 hours (not 8.85
hours) for Mr. Scott Tucker. (Brown Decl., Exhibit D; Brown Supp. Decl., ¶ 6.) 
After reviewing the itemized
bills, however, the Court determined that the reply  calculations by Stavropoulos are also
incorrect.  Stavropoulos has attached the
billing statements to Ms. Brown’s declaration with the opening papers. The Court
found that adding each number of hours in the timekeeper summary for Ms. Nancy
Brown, the total number of hours is 299.22 hours—not 357.52 hours.  Thus, multiplying this number by Ms. Nancy
Brown’s hourly rate of $625.00 equals $187,012.50.
Stavropoulos’s calculations for
Scott Tucker advocated for in the reply brief also are not exactly correct. The
Court also found that adding each number of hours in the timekeeper summary for
Mr. Scott Tucker, the total number of hours is 11.05 hours, not 11.75 hours.
Thus, multiplying this number by Mr. Scott Tucker’s hourly rate of $230.00
equals $2,541.50. 
The Court will only award
Stavropoulos an amount of attorney fees that is directly supported by the
evidence that counsel has provided, which includes the itemized bills attached
as exhibits within counsel’s declaration. (Brown Decl., Exhibit D.) Using the
amounts for Ms. Nancy Brown and Mr. Scott Tucker that were substantiated by the
evidence, the total becomes $354,587.00.
The parties may point out any
problem with the Court’s calculation if it is incorrect in any way.
The Court notes that correcting
parties’ math errors is not a good use of the Court’s resources.  The Court considered simply awarding $244,067.50
originally calculated by the hours set forth in Stavropoulos’s opening papers,
given that Stavropoulos’s calculations were incorrect in both the opening and
reply papers.  If Plaintiffs have
authority that this is the more appropriate result, they may bring that
authority to the Court’s attention at the hearing.
