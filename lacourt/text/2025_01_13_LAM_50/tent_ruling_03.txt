[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
PETITION TO APPROVE MINOR’S COMPROMISE OF
  PENDING ACTION
 




            
Background
On August 3, 2023, a
number of Plaintiffs filed this action against Defendant CCV Partnership II,
including, inter alia, Plaintiffs Javier Soto and Fernando Soto, a minor
by and through his Guardian ad Litem, Javier Soto. 
The parties have
reached a settlement in this matter.
Javier Soto as Petitioner for Claimant Fernando Soto (“Petitioner”) now petitions for the Court’s approval of the settlement on
behalf of the Claimant.  
            Discussion
An enforceable settlement of a minor’s claim can only be consummated
with court approval. ((Prob. Code, § 3500.) “A
petition for court approval of a compromise of, or a covenant not to sue or
enforce judgment, on a minor’s disputed claim; a compromise or settlement of a
pending action or proceeding to which a minor or person with a disability is a
party; or the disposition of the proceeds of a judgment for a minor or person
with a disability under Probate Code sections 3500 and
3600-3613 or Code of Civil Procedure section 372
must be verified by the petitioner and must contain a full disclosure of all
information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise,
covenant, settlement, or disposition. Except as provided in rule 7.950.5, the
petition must be submitted on a completed Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or
Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person With a Disability (form
MC-350).” (California Rules of Court, rule 7.950, emphasis in
original.)  
Here, the petition is prepared on form
MC-350 and is verified by Petitioner. 
However,
as noted in the Court’s December 3, 2024 Order on Claimant’s prior petition, it appears that Item 17(e) of the petition
should check “is,” as opposed to “is not.” Item 17(e) of the instant petition
still checks “is not.” The petition includes an Attachment 17e providing, inter
alia, “[t]he firm of Friedman & Chapman LLP represents all of the
plaintiffs in this matter including the petitioners who are the guardian ad
litems for all minors in this matter.” 
In addition, Item 8(a)(1) of
the proposed order (Form MC-351) still does not specify who the attorney’s fees
are payable to. 
            Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the Court intends to grant the
petition and approve the compromise, subject to Petitioner correcting the
defects identified above, and subject to Plaintiffs’ examination of Petitioner
at the hearing.¿¿ 
Petitioner is ordered to give notice of this Order.
