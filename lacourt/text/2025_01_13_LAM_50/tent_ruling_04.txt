CROSS-DEFENDANTS’

AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION


 



            
Background
On February 9, 2024,
Plaintiffs Sukhinderpal Gill and Angela Hercilia Ganem, individually and as
Trustees of the PSG Family Hycet Trust u/d/t December 6, 2011, the AHG Family
Hycet Trust, u/d/t December 6, 2011, and the Gill and Ganem Trust amended
and restated u/d/t September 5, 2012 filed a Complaint for Specific Performance
in this action against Defendants Behzad Cohan and Nori D. Cohan, individually
and as Trustees of the BC Family Hycet Trust u/d/t December 6, 2011, the NC
Family Hycet Trust u/d/t December 6, 2011, and the Behzad and Nori D. Cohan
Trust amended and restated u/d/t August 1, 2012 (collectively, “the Cohan
Parties”).
            On August 27, 2024, the Cohan
Parties filed a Cross-Complaint against Sukhinderpal Gill and Angela Hercilia Ganem, individually and as
Trustees of the PSG Family Hycet Trust u/d/t December 6, 2011, the AHG Family
Hycet Trust, u/d/t December 6, 2011, and the Gill and Ganem Trust amended
and restated u/d/t September 5, 2012. The Cross-Complaint alleges causes of
action for (1) breach of fiduciary duty, (2) fraud and deceit, (3) fraudulent
concealment, (4) negligent misrepresentation, (5) constructive fraud, (6)
unjust enrichment, 
(7)
rescission, (8) breach of contract, and (9) breach of the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing. 
Cross-Defendants Sukhinderpal Gill and Angela Ganem (jointly,
“Cross-Defendants”) now demur to each of the causes of action of the
Cross-Complaint. The Cohan Parties oppose. 
Discussion 
As an initial matter, the Court notes that Cross-Defendants’
counsel’s declaration in support of the demurrer provides, inter alia,
that “[o]n October 1, 2024, my legal assistant, Aaron Kirk, emailed Mr.
Robinson (the Cohan Parties’ counsel) a 7-page meet and confer letter
identifying the fatal insufficiencies in each cause of action in the
Cross-Complaint.” (Pech Decl., ¶ 4.) On October 1, 2024, the Cohan Parties’
counsel sent an email to Cross-Defendants’ counsel indicating, inter alia,
that “[w]e just received your meet and confer letter which cannot be considered
a good faith effort to meet and confer given that your responsive pleading
deadline is tomorrow.” (Pech Decl., ¶ 5, Ex. 4.) Cross-Defendants’ counsel
states that “[a]t 3:00 pm on October 2, 2024, Mr. Cole (the Cohan Parties’
counsel) and I had a meet and confer on a discovery dispute raised by him. I
asked him to discuss my October 1, 2024 letter. He said he had not read it and
that I could not file a good faith declaration...” (Pech Decl., ¶ 7.)
The Court notes that Cross-Defendants’ counsel’s
declaration does not demonstrate that the parties met and conferred in person, by telephone, or by video conference
regarding the instant demurrer. Pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), “[b]efore
filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall
meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference
with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the
purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve
the objections to be raised in the demurrer.” (Emphasis added.) Moreover,
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41, subdivision (a)(2), “[t]he parties shall meet and confer at least 5 days
before the date the responsive pleading is due.”
(Emphasis added.) Such meeting and conferring must
be done in good faith with an effort to try to resolve the issues subject to
the demurrer.  
In light of the
foregoing, the hearing on Cross-Defendants’ demurrer is continued to _______________, 2025 at 2 p.m. in
Dept. 50.¿ 
Cross-Defendants
are¿ordered to meet¿and confer¿with the Cohan Parties within 10 days
of the date of this order.¿If the parties are unable to resolve the pleading
issues¿or if the parties are otherwise unable to meet and confer in good faith,
Cross-Defendants are to¿thereafter¿file and serve¿a declaration setting forth
the efforts to meet and confer in compliance with¿Code of Civil
Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a)(3) within
15 days of this order.¿ 
Cross-Defendants are ordered to give notice of this order.¿
