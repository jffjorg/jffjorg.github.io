And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the petitions to approve the compromise of the minor's claims and related cross-actions. The Court finds that the settlement is reasonable and intends to grant the petitions, subject to the examination of petitioners at the hearing and correction of certain defects. Specifically, the Court notes that the petition for Claimant Maria Velen Marin-Marquez lacks proof of service, and if this is not corrected, the petition will be denied without prejudice. The Court also notes that the petition for Claimant Perla Marin Marquez lacks an order on Form MC-351 and that Item 11(b)(5) of the petition for Claimant Edwin Toribio Gomez Vicente appears to reference other plaintiffs or claimants not involved in the instant action.
