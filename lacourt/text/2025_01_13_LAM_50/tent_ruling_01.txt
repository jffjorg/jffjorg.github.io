[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:
 
AMENDED PETITIONS TO APPROVE MINOR’S COMPROMISE
  OF PENDING ACTION (3) 




AND RELATED CROSS-ACTIONS


 




            
Background
Plaintiffs Maria De
Jesus Guzman Padilla; Jade Esmeralda Guzman, a minor by and through her
guardian ad litem, Maria De Jesus
Guzman Padilla; Jose Giovany Guzman, a minor by and through his guardian
ad litem, Maria De Jesus Guzman
Padilla; Daisi Sanchez Guzman, a minor by and through her guardian ad
litem, Maria De Jesus Guzman
Padilla; and a number of other plaintiffs filed this action on March 25, 2022
against Defendants Linda V. Armor, Taylor Equities 17, LLC, RI 1812 Apartments
LLC, and 1812 5th Street LLC. The Complaint alleges causes of action for (1)
breach of warranty of habitability, (2) breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment,
(3) negligence, (4) breach of contract, (5) nuisance, and (6) unfair
competition in violation of Business and Professions
Code section 17200, et seq. 
            A
number of Cross-Complaints have also been filed in the instant action. 
A settlement has been reached in this case. Maria De Jesus Guzman Padilla as
Petitioner for Claimants Jade Esmeralda Guzman, Jose Giovany Guzman, and Daisi
Sanchez Guzman now petitions for the Court’s approval of the settlement on behalf of
the Claimants.  
            Discussion
An enforceable settlement of a minor’s claim can only be consummated
with court approval. ((Prob. Code, § 3500.) “A petition for court approval of a compromise of, or a
covenant not to sue or enforce judgment, on a minor’s disputed claim; a
compromise or settlement of a pending action or proceeding to which a minor or
person with a disability is a party; or the disposition of the proceeds of a
judgment for a minor or person with a disability under Probate
Code sections 3500 and 3600-3613 or Code of Civil
Procedure section 372 must be verified by the petitioner and must contain a
full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness
of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition. Except as provided in rule 7.950.5, the
petition must be submitted on a completed Petition for Approval of Compromise of Claim or Action or
Disposition of Proceeds of Judgment for Minor or Person With a Disability (form
MC-350).” (California Rules of Court, rule 7.950, emphasis in original.)  
Here, the petitions are prepared on Form
MC-350 and are verified by Petitioner. The Court
finds that the settlement is reasonable. 
            Conclusion
Based on the foregoing, the Court intends to grant the
petitions and approve the compromise, subject to Plaintiffs’ examination of
Petitioner at the hearing.¿¿
Petitioner is to
give notice of this Order.
