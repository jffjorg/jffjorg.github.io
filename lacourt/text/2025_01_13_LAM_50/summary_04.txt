The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving a demurrer to a cross-complaint filed by defendants Behzad Cohan and Nori D. Cohan against plaintiffs Sukhinderpal Gill and Angela Hercilia Ganem. The defendants have demurred to each cause of action in the cross-complaint, and the plaintiffs have opposed the demurrer. The judge has continued the hearing on the demurrer to a later date to allow the parties to meet and confer in good faith and to resolve the pleading issues. The judge has ordered the defendants to meet and confer with the plaintiffs within 10 days of the date of the order, and to file a declaration setting forth the efforts to meet and confer if the parties are unable to resolve the issues or if they are unable to meet and confer in good faith.
