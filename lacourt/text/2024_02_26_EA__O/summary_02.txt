Roles:
  - Judge
  - Plaintiff
  - Defendant
  - Counsel Ghobrial
Significant Statements:
  - "Statement of damages must provide actual notice of the nature and amount of damages being sought by plaintiff"
  - "The SOD limits the amount of actual damages the plaintiff can recover in a default judgment"
  - "The default judgment application is premature as default was prematurely entered"
  - "The application would be denied without prejudice for another reason: Plaintiff has not explained how it calculated its general damages"
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is denying the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. The main reasons for this decision are that the plaintiff has not served a statement of damages (SOD) and has not explained how it calculated its general damages. The SOD is required to provide actual notice of the nature and amount of damages being sought by the plaintiff, and the plaintiff has not provided this information. Additionally, the plaintiff has not explained how it calculated its general damages, which are a type of non-quantifiable damage. The judge is denying the application without prejudice, meaning that the plaintiff can re-file the application once the SOD has been served and the general damages have been explained.
