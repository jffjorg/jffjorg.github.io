And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's previous order sustaining the defendant's demurrer. The plaintiff argues that the case has new injuries, different onset dates, and different causes of action, but the judge finds that the motion is not based on new facts or law. The judge applies the standard for reconsideration under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a), which requires new or different facts, circumstances, or law. Since the plaintiff has not identified any applicable new facts or law, the motion is denied.
