TAMARA HARRIS 
  
        
  vs.
 
KAISER PERMANENTE, et al. 
 


 Case
  No.:  24STCV12517 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 13, 2024



 
Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration
is DENIED.
 
            On
5/17/2024, in propria persona Plaintiff Tamara Harris (Plaintiff) filed
suit against Kaiser Permanente and Sedgwick Claims Management Services
(collectively, Defendants), alleging: (1) professional negligence; (2) business
and medical malpractice; (3) emotional distress; (4) breach of contract; and
(5) violation of the Insurance Code.
 
            On
11/13/2024, the Court sustained Defendant’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint,
without leave to amend. 
 
            Now,
Plaintiff moves for reconsideration of the Court’s 11/13/2024 Order. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1008, subdivision (a), a motion for
reconsideration must be brought “within 10 days after service upon the party of
written notice of entry of the order and based upon new or different facts,
circumstances, or law, make application to the same judge or court that made
the order, to reconsider the matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior
order.”  (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th
206, 212.) 
 
Discussion 
 
            Plaintiff
argues that the Court should reconsider its 11/13/2024 Order because “[t]his
case…has new injuries, different onset dates and most importantly different
causes of action.” (Demurrer, 1.) 
 
            However,
a motion for reconsideration cannot simply ask the Court to “reevaluate” or
“reanalyze” pre-existing factual and/or legal issues and/or arguments
previously made. (See Crotty v. Trader (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 765, 771.)
The Court considered all submitted moving papers when reaching its ruling.
Accordingly, the Court may not properly reevaluate its substantive decision,
unless there are some new facts or law which would warrant such
reconsideration. Plaintiff has not identified any applicable new facts or law. 
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration is denied. 
 
It is so ordered.
