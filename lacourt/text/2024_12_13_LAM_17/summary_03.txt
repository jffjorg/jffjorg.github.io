And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer is sustained, without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Arno Patrick Kuigoua, filed a lawsuit against the defendant, The Matthew L. Tuck & Associates, et al., alleging improper claims that are barred and cannot be asserted in this action. The judge found that the plaintiff's claim is barred by a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that the parties signed on February 20, 2024, which includes a release of all claims against the defendants. The judge ruled that the parties' agreement to be bound by the MOU terms is enforceable, even though the parties intended to execute a formal agreement later.
