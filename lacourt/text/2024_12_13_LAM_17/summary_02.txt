Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, ruling that the plaintiff is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. The plaintiff has established that it is the rightful owner of the property, that it is entitled to immediate possession of the property, and that the defendants have maintained unlawful detainer of the property as holdover occupants. The plaintiff has also established that it has incurred holdover damages in the amount of at least $900/day since the expiration of the notice to quit on February 23, 2024.

The defendants' affirmative defenses, including protection under the Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance, protection under the California Tenant Protection Act of 2019, defective notice, breach of warranty of habitability, waiver, change or cancellation of Notice to Quit, defense of equity, retaliatory eviction, and discrimination, are without merit.

The judge also rejected the defendants' argument that they reasonably relied on a promise to repurchase the property, finding that the evidence presented shows a clear communication of the terms for repurchase and the defendants' failure to meet those terms. The judge noted that the defendants did not submit any evidence showing that they took any steps to comply with the alleged agreement to repurchase the property.
