Trial Date
 
            Jury trial
is currently set for March 11, 2024.
 
Instant Motion
 
            Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
now moves this court for an order continuing trial by six months, with
discovery deadlines to track the new date.
 
Decision
 
            The motion
is GRANTED. Trial is continued to September 23, 2024, at 9:00 am. Final Status
Conference is set for September 12, 2024, at 10:00 am. All counsel are to
appear IN PERSON at the Final Status Conference. All discovery-related
deadlines will track the new date, as well as the deadlines for motions in
limine and the preparation of trial documents.
 
Discussion
 
California
Rules of Court Rule 3.1332(a) provides that trial dates are to be treated as
firm. However, Rule 3.1332(c) provides that, although continuances are “disfavored,”
requests should be considered on an individual basis. That subsection also
includes a non-exhaustive list of possible grounds for a continuance.
 
            Defendants base
their motion on Rule 3.1332(c)(5), which provides for a continuance if a new
party has been added to the case. That subdivision applies here.
 
            Cross-Defendant
Amyan joined this case by filing an answer to the MCR Cross-Complaint less than
three weeks before the present trial date. He is entitled to conduct discovery
and prepare his defense.
 
            The court
currently has 5 other trials scheduled for March 11, another case trailing pending
long cause submission, and still another trailing to March 18. Of those, three
are older than this case. Therefore, the court’s calendar also compels a
continuance.
 
            Finally,
counsel should note that this case will be four years old in September of this
year. It has now been continued on two separate occasions because a new party
has been added on a cross-complaint immediately prior to trial. Counsel should
be advised that the court has no present intention of giving another
continuance. If a new party should once again be added on a cross-complaint,
the court’s inclination will be to sever that cross-complaint and proceed with
the remainder of the case.
 
Conclusion
 
            Because a
new party has recently been brought into the case and because the court’s own
calendar is impacted, the motion for a continuance is GRANTED. Trial is
continued to September 23, 2024, at 9:00 am. Final Status Conference is set for
September 12, 2024, at 10:00 am. All counsel are to appear IN PERSON at the Final
Status Conference. All discovery-related deadlines will track the new date, as
well as the deadlines for motions in limine and the preparation of trial
documents.
