And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a court hearing scheduled for March 11, 2024, in a case involving a dispute between plaintiff Gould and defendants Bolour, USITM, Rodal, SBPI, Colon, AWS, Hulick, and Oanda.

The case involves allegations that the defendants tricked Gould into putting $400,000 into a trading account and engaging in leveraged trades, resulting in a loss of $250,000. Gould is suing the defendants for various claims, including breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud.

The court has issued an order to show cause (OSC) regarding the failure to serve the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) on some of the defendants, including USITM and Hulick. The court has also issued an OSC regarding the default of Hulick, which was entered on August 24, 2023.

The court has ruled that the default of Hulick is VACATED due to the failure of Gould's counsel to warn defense counsel before seeking entry of default, which is a violation of the court's rules and ethical obligations. Additionally, the court has determined that the service of the SAC on Hulick was defective, and therefore, the court lacks jurisdiction to enter any default judgment against Hulick.

The court has ordered Hulick to file an answer within 24 hours, and the case will proceed with a jury trial scheduled for March 11, 2024.
