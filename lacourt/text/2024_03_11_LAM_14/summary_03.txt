And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 23STCV27906, a Residential Unlawful Detainer case. Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint on January 5, 2024, and Defendant Davis filed an Answer on January 16, 2024. The case is currently set for a Jury Trial on March 11, 2024. Defendant Davis has moved for summary judgment, arguing that the damages request is excessive, specifically that Plaintiff is barred by res judicata from recovering rent for April 2023. The Judge has denied the motion, ruling that the reduction of Plaintiff's available damages is not a permissible topic for summary judgment or summary adjudication. The Judge cites California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1170.7 and 437c in support of the decision.
