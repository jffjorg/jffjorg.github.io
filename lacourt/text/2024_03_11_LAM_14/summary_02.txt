And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion for continuance filed by the plaintiff. The trial date is continued to September 23, 2024, with a final status conference set for September 12, 2024. All counsel are required to appear in person at the final status conference. The court has also ordered that all discovery-related deadlines will track the new date.

The judge based their decision on California Rules of Court Rule 3.1332(c), which allows for continuances if a new party is added to the case. In this case, a new party, Ara Amyan, was added to the case just a few weeks before the original trial date. The judge also considered the court's own calendar, which is already heavily scheduled, and the age of the case, which will be four years old in September.

The judge warned counsel that they will not grant another continuance if a new party is added to the case again. If that happens, the judge will likely sever the cross-complaint and proceed with the remainder of the case.
