            Jury Trial

Demurrer
 
Defendant Davis now moves for
summary judgment on the grounds that the damages request is excessive.

Decision
 
            The motion
is DENIED.
 
Discussion
 
            Defendant
Davis brings this motion on the grounds that Plaintiff is barred by res
judicata from recovering rent for April 2023 as part of its damages. Plaintiff
disagrees. However, this matter is not an appropriate subject for summary
judgment.
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure § 1170.7 permits a motion for summary judgment in unlawful
detainer cases. With the exception of the notice period, such a motion is to be
governed by Code of Civil Procedure § 437c.
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure § 437c(a) only permits a motion for summary judgment “if
it is contended that the [entire] action has no merit.” Code of Civil Procedure
§ 437c(f) permits the court to adjudicate a portion of the action only if granting
the motion woud “completely” dispose of a cause of action or defense.
 
            The
reduction of Plaintiff’s available damages is not a permissible topic for
summary judgment or summary adjudication.
