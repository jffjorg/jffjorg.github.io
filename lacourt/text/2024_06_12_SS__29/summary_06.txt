And here is the English text summary:

The tentative ruling denies Defendant's motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff without prejudice. The Defendant served the Plaintiff with a deposition notice on February 1, 2024, but the Plaintiff did not serve an objection to the notice and did not appear for the deposition. The Defendant is entitled to take the Plaintiff's deposition, but to obtain a court order, the Defendant must comply with all statutory requirements, including submitting a declaration showing an attempt to contact the deponent to inquire about the non-appearance. Since no such declaration was submitted, the motion is denied without prejudice.
