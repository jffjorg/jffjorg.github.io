 Case Number:  21STCV23847    Hearing Date:   June 12, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Compel Attendance at Deposition filed by Defendant Angelica Bianca Diaz
 
TENTATIVE 
 
Defendant’s motion to compel the deposition of
Plaintiff and request for sanctions is DENIED without prejudice. 
 
Background 
 
Two consolidated cases arise out of a
multi-vehicle automobile accident on July 6, 2019, near the Adams Exit on the 110
Freeway in Los Angeles.
In Case No. 21STCV23847 (the “Marinero Action”), Plaintiffs
Luis Felix Marinero, Ana Rodriguez, and Nathaly Rodriguez filed a complaint on
June 28, 2021, asserting causes of action for negligence and negligence per se
against Defendant Angelica Bianca Diaz (“Diaz”) and Does 1 through
25.  Diaz filed her answer on August 20, 2021.
In Case No. 21STCV24492 (the “Smith Action”), Plaintiff
Lloyd Smith (“Smith”) filed a complaint on July 1, 2021, asserting a cause of
action for negligence against Defendants Diaz, Luis Rodriguez, and Does 1
through 50.  On February 1, 2023, Diaz
and Luis Rodriguez each filed their answers.  Diaz and Luis Rodriguez
filed Cross-Complaints against each other as well.
On March 15, 2023, the Court determined that the
Marinero Action and the Smith Action are related cases.  On February 23, 2024, the Court consolidated
the Marinero Action and the Smith Action, with the Marinero Action as the lead
case.
Luis Rodriguez has on three occasions filed a
motion for a determination that his settlement with Smith is a good faith
settlement under Code of Civil Procedure section 877.6.  Diaz has opposed each motion.  The Court denied the first two motions for
lack of sufficient evidence to support the requested relief.  The third motion was fully briefed but was
taken off calendar when moving party failed to appear at the hearing on April
3, 2024.
On March 29 and April 4, 2024, Diaz and Luis
Rodriguez filed requests for dismissals of the claims in their cross-complaints
against each other.  The dismissals were
entered on April 2 and 5, 2024. 
On April 23, 2024, three discovery motions filed
by Luis Rodriguez were placed off calendar when his counsel failed to appear
for the hearing.
As is relevant to this motion, on
November 2, 2023, Defendant Diaz noticed the deposition of Plaintiff Smith for
November 14.  (Pyles Decl., ¶ 4.)  Smith did not appear.  (Id., ¶¶ 5-6 & Exh. A.)  Following the deposition, Diaz’s counsel
followed up with Smith’s counsel to reschedule the deposition but received no
response.  (Id., ¶ 7.) 
 
On
March 1, 2024, Diaz filed this motion to compel Smith’s deposition. 
 
No
opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard 
“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the
requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a deposition
notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice
must be served.  
“The
service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a party
to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party
to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280, subd. (a).)
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
Section
2025.450, subdivision (a), provides:
“If, after service of a deposition notice,
a party to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a
party, or a person
designated by an organization that is a party under Section 2025.230, without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce
for¿inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move
for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.”  
Any
such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,
when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.”  (Id.,
subd. (b).)  
When
a motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
 In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, section
2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to
include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of
discovery.”  Where a party or attorney
has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary
sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Id., § 2023.030, subd. (a).)
Discussion 
Counsel for Defendant Diaz attests that on November 2,
2023, Diaz served a Notice of Taking Plaintiff’s Deposition,
set for November 14, 2023. (Pyles Decl., ¶ 4.) 
; Exh. A.) Plaintiff Smith failed to appear.  (Id., ¶¶ 5-6 & Exh. A.) 
Diaz
has not, however, attached a copy of the notice of deposition to the motion. As
a result, the court cannot verify whether the notice was properly served on
Smith (or any other party).  Therefore,
the motion is denied without prejudice.
As the
motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition is denied, the request for sanctions is
also denied.
 
Conclusion 
 
Accordingly,
Defendant Diaz’s motion to compel the
deposition of Plaintiff and request for sanctions is DENIED without prejudice. 
 
Defendant is ordered to give notice.
