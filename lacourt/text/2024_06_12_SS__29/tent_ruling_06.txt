 Case Number:  21STCV24295    Hearing Date:   June 12, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s Motion to Compel the Deposition of Plaintiff 
 
Tentative
The
motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
On June 30, 2021, Charlotte Woods
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Shant Apet (“Defendant”), Enterprises
Inc., and Does 1 through 50 for negligence arising out of an automobile
accident occurring on July 5, 2019 on Slauson Avenue.
 
On January 25, 2023, Shant Apet
(“Defendant”) filed an answer.
 
On January 18, 2024, Defendant noticed
Plaintiff’s deposition for February 1, 2024. 
(Blunt Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh. A.) 
Plaintiff did not serve any objection to the notice.  (Id., ¶¶ 2-3.)  Plaintiff did not appear.  (Id., ¶ 5 & Exh. C.)  Although Defendant contacted Plaintiff prior
to the deposition, there is no evidence submitted that Defendant contacted
Plaintiff after the deposition to inquire about the non-appearance.
 
On February 27, 2024, Defendant filed
this motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff. 
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
“Any
party may obtain discovery … by taking in California the oral deposition of any
person, including any party to the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.010.) 
Code of Civil Procedure sections 2025.210 through 2025.280 provide the
requirements for (among other things) what must be included in a deposition
notice, when and where depositions may be taken, and how and when the notice
must be served.  
“The
service of a deposition notice … is effective to require any deponent who is a party
to the action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party
to attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document, electronically
stored information, or tangible thing for inspection and copying.”  (Id., § 2025.280, subd. (a).)
Section
2025.410, subdivision (a), requires any party to serve a written objection at
least three days before the deposition if the party contends that a deposition
notice does not comply with the provisions of sections 2025.210 through
2025.280.
Section
2025.450, subdivision (a), provides:
“If,
after service of a deposition notice, a party to the action or an officer,
director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a person designated by an organization
that is a party under Section 2025.230, without
having served a valid objection under Section 2025.410, fails to appear for
examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce for¿inspection any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move for an order compelling
the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the production for inspection of
any document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in
the deposition notice.”  
Any
such motion to compel must show good cause for the production of documents and,
when a deponent has failed to appear, the motion must be accompanied “by a
declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire
about the nonappearance.”  (Id.,
subd. (b).)  
When
a motion to compel is granted, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) in favor of the party who noticed
the deposition and against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is
affiliated, unless the court finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id., § 2025.450, subd. (g)(1).) 
In Chapter 7 of
the Civil Discovery Act, section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses
of the discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to
an authorized method of discovery.” 
Where a party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery
process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct.”  (Id., § 2023.030,
subd. (a).)
Discussion
Defendant served Plaintiff with a
notice for the taking of her deposition on February 1, 2024.  (Blunt Decl., ¶ 2 & Exh. A.)  Plaintiff did not serve any objection to the
notice and did not appear.  (Id.,
¶¶ 2-3, 5 & Exh. C.)  
 
 
Defendant is plainly entitled to take
Plaintiff’s deposition.  But to obtain a
court order for the deposition, Defendant must comply with all of the statutory
requirements for such an order.  One of
those requirements is that the moving party must include in the moving papers a
declaration showing that an attempt to contact the deponent to inquire about
the non-appearance.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450,
subd. (b).)  No such declaration is in
the record here.
 
Accordingly, the motion is denied without
prejudice.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court
DENIES without prejudice Defendant’s motion to compel the deposition of
Plaintiff. 
 
Moving party is ORDERED to give notice.
