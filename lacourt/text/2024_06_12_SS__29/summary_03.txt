And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has reviewed the petitions filed by claimants Matthew Angel Balladares and Alan Reyes Corona, both under the age of 10, seeking approval of a minor's compromise. The petitions are complete and meet all applicable requirements, but the proposed orders are incomplete. As a result, the court is continuing the hearing for a brief period to allow the petitioner to submit revised and complete proposed orders. The court excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call.
