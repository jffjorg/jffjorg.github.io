And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling denies Defendant Angelica Bianca Diaz's motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Lloyd Smith and requests for sanctions. The motion was filed on March 1, 2024, and no opposition has been filed. The court finds that the notice of taking deposition was served on November 2, 2023, but the notice was not attached to the motion, making it impossible to verify whether the notice was properly served on Smith. As a result, the motion is denied without prejudice. The request for sanctions is also denied without prejudice.
