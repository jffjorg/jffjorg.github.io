Background
On July 31, 2023, Sijia Chen (“Plaintiff”) filed a
complaint against Nailington Corp. (“Defendant”), Doe 1 Cosmetologist, and Does
2 through 20 for negligence arising out of chemical burns and abrasions
sustained during a pedicure on November 2, 2022. 
 
On November 20, 2023, (“Defendant”) filed an answer.
 
On December 12, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with
discovery, including Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories
(Set One), Requests for Production (Set One), and Requests for Admission (Set
One).  (Rosenberg Decls., ¶ 2.)  Plaintiff granted three extensions to Defendant,
but still Defendant did not respond to the discovery.  (Id., ¶¶ 3-7.)
 
On April 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed these four motions: three
motions to compel responses and a fourth motion for a deemed-admitted order as
to the Requests for Admission.
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard

A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days after service. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories are
directed does not provide a timely response, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling response to the interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290,
subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses,
and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition,
a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a
party moves to compel initial responses to interrogatories, “the court shall
impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010)
against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the
motion], unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2030.290, subd. (c).)
A
party must respond to requests for production of documents within 30 days after
service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests
for production of documents are directed does not provide timely responses, the
requesting party may move for an order compelling response to the demand. (Id.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for a motion to compel initial
responses, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., §
2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement
be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who fails to provide a
timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel
initial responses to requests for production, “the court shall impose a monetary
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party,
person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it
finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification
or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd.
(c).) Requests for admission may be
propounded on a party without leave of court 10 days after the service of the
summons on, or appearance by that party, whichever occurs first. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.020(b).)
A party must respond to requests
for admission within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.250,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for admission are directed does not
provide a timely response, the propounding party “may move for an order that … the
truth of [the] matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).) There is no time limit for such a
motion, and no meet and confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2033.280;
Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1345(b)(1).)  In
addition, a party who fails to provide a timely response generally waives all
objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280,
subd. (a).) 
The court “shall” make the order
that the truth of the matters specified in the request be deemed admitted unless
the court “finds that the party to whom the requests for admission have been
directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to
the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with Section
2033.220.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c); see St. Mary v. Super. Ct. (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 762, 778-780.)
“It is mandatory that the court impose
a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) on the
party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a timely response to
requests for admission necessitated this motion [to deem admitted the truth of
the matters specified in the requests for admission].”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7 of the Civil Discovery Act, Code
of Civil Procedure section 2023.010, subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the
discovery process” to include “[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an
authorized method of discovery.”  Where a
party or attorney has engaged in misuse of the discovery process, the court may
impose a monetary sanction in the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)
Discussion
On December 12, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with Form
Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One), Requesta for
Production (Set One), and Requests for Admission (Set One).  (Rosenberg Decls., ¶ 2.)  Defendant did not respond to the discovery.  (Id., ¶¶ 3-7.)
 
Plaintiff need not show anything more.  The motions to compel are granted.  The motion for a deemed-admitted order is
granted.
 
The requests for sanctions are denied in part
and granted in part.
 
The Court denies the sanctions requests in
the three motions to compel.  
 
Defendant seeks sanctions under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2031.010, 2023.030, 2030.290, 2031.300.
Section 2023.010 defines “misuses of the discovery
process” but does not authorize sanctions.
Section 2023.030 authorizes sanctions only “[t]o the
extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or
any other provision of this title.”  The
Court of Appeal, in an opinion by Justice Moor, made this very point in City
of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466,
504.  (The Court is aware that the
California Supreme Court has granted review of the City of Los Angeles
case.  The order granting review, filed
on January 25, 2023, states that pending review, the appellate opinion “may be
cited,” including “for its persuasive value.” 
The Court finds the reasoning of Justice Moor, which is based on the
plain language of the applicable statutes, to be persuasive.) 
Section 2030.290, subdivision (c), and section
2031.300, subdivision (c), authorize sanctions against a party or attorney “who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes” a motion to compel.  Here, no opposition was filed.  
The Court recognizes that other
provisions of the Civil Discovery Act authorize sanctions under different
circumstances, without an unsuccessful opposition to a motion to compel.  (E.g., Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.450, subd.
(g)(1) & 2033.280, subd. (c).)  Here,
however, the Legislature provided that sanctions may be awarded only upon an
unsuccessful motion or opposition.
 
The Court grants the request for
sanctions in connection with the motion for a deemed-admitted order as to the Requests
for Admission.  In that statute, the
Legislature has provided that sanctions are “mandatory” and there is no
requirement of an unsuccessful opposition. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (c).)
 
After considering the relatively
straightforward nature of this motion, and the economies of scale associated
with preparing several parallel discovery motions, the Court sets sanctions in
the amount of $750, based on 1.5 hours of attorney work multiplied by counsel’s
reasonable billing rate of $500 per hour.
