And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the motion to compel deposition brought by the defendants, Pacific Mechanical Contractors and John Venegas. The defendants argued that the plaintiff, Eduardo Galeno, failed to provide a mutually agreeable date for the deposition, but the court found that no deposition notice was served on the plaintiff. The court held that CCP ยง 2025.450(a) requires valid service of a deposition notice before a motion to compel can be brought. The court found that the defendants' motion was premature and denied it.
