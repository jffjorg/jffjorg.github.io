And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants Defendant's unopposed motion for terminating sanctions, which dismisses Plaintiff's action against Defendant. The Court finds that Plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery obligations was willful and without just cause, and that lesser sanctions would not curb the abuse. The Court concludes that the Plaintiff's counsel's absence from the case and the Plaintiff's apparent disinterest in prosecuting the action justify the imposition of terminating sanctions. The Court denies Defendant's request for additional monetary sanctions, as the dismissal of Plaintiff's action against Defendant is sufficient to meet the ends of justice.
