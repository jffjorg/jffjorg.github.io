And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is denying the motion to continue the trial date without prejudice. The motion was filed by SoCal Transportation & Tours Inc. (SoCal) to continue the trial date due to its planned motion for summary judgment. However, SoCal failed to provide sufficient information to support its motion, and the Court has cancelled the reservation made by SoCal in the Court Reservation System (CRS). The Judge notes that the motion for summary judgment is abstract and lacks substance. The Judge also notes that the Court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance. The motion is denied without prejudice, and SoCal may renew its motion once it has sufficient information to reserve and properly file a motion for summary judgment.
