And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the motion to enforce the settlement agreement between the parties. The motion is denied due to lack of jurisdiction over the defendants, lack of proper notice for the motion, and substantive deficiencies in the motion. The Court finds that the settlement agreement is not enforceable due to the lack of jurisdiction over the defendants. The Court also finds that the dispute between the party plaintiffs over the settlement proceeds is not before the Court and therefore cannot rule on the dispute.
