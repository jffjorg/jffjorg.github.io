And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to enforce a settlement between the parties. The motion was filed by Noah Ryder Norton and Nathaniel Wyatt Norton, both minors, through their respective guardians. The settlement allegedly covers the wrongful death of Decedent Robert Jasen Norton. However, the judge finds several issues with the motion. Firstly, the notice of the motion was not properly filed. Secondly, the judge lacks jurisdiction over some defendants, including Advanced Access Controls Inc. and some individual defendants. Thirdly, the dispute between Noah and Nathaniel over the settlement proceeds is not before the court, as it is a dispute between party plaintiffs. Finally, the judge finds that the court has no authority to enforce the settlement, as it is not a breach of contract claim. Therefore, the motion to enforce settlement is denied.
