And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Arina Builders, has moved to strike the answers of the defendants, 1999 Sycamore, LLC, et al., and enter default. The defendants are unrepresented entities, and under California law, a corporation cannot represent itself before a court of record. The court has granted the plaintiff's motion to strike the defendants' answers and enter default. The defendants failed to appear for a hearing and have not filed any papers showing that they are represented by counsel. The court finds that the defendants have not complied with the court's order to show that they are represented by counsel and grants the plaintiff's motion.
