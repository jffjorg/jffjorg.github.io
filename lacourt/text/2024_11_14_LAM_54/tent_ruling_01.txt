PLAINTIFF TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties wish to submit on the tentative, please
email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing.
 
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received. 
 
“Any party, within the time allowed to
response to a pleading, may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the
whole or any part" of that pleading. (CCP 435(b). “The Court may, upon a
motion made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon
terms it deems proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false or improper matter
asserted in any pleading; (b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not
drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order
of the Court." (CCP 436.) 
 
Plaintiff moves to strike the answers
of Defendants Capital Stone Management, Inc. and CSM
Sycamore, LLC on the ground that they are unrepresented entities. “A corporation has the capacity to
bring a lawsuit because it has all the powers of a natural person in carrying
out its business. (§ 17; Corp. Code, §§ 105, 207.) However, under a
long-standing common law rule of procedure, a corporation, unlike a natural
person, cannot represent itself before courts of record in propria persona, nor
can it represent itself through a corporate officer, director or other employee
who is not an attorney. It must be represented by licensed counsel in
proceedings before courts of record.” (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of San
Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1145.)
 
On July 17, 2024, the Court granted the
motions of Defendants’ counsel to be relieved. Counsel effectuated service of
this order on Defendants on August 15, 2024. On September 4, 2024, the Court
held a trial setting conference and OSC re: representation of the corporate
entities. Defendants failed to appear for this hearing and have not filed any
papers showing they are represented by counsel. Defendants have not opposed
this motion to show they have retained counsel. 
 
Plaintiff’s motion to strike Defendants’
answers and enter default is GRANTED.
