Here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendants' motions to compel plaintiff Josue Alvarez-Baez to respond to various discovery requests, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents. The motions are denied without prejudice because the defendants failed to provide a valid proof of service. The plaintiff has been representing himself in pro per since March 2022. The defendants served the plaintiff with written discovery, including form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production of documents, in December 2021. However, the plaintiff failed to respond to these requests. The defendants filed motions to compel responses to these requests on May 3, 2024. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to provide a timely response and has waived all objections. The court also notes that the defendants' proof of service is defective and does not comply with the California Rules of Court.
