Background
On September 21,
2021, Josue Alvarez-Baez (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Guillermo
Carrillo Velazquez, Eduardo Soya, Eddie’s Trucking, Inc., and Does 1 through 10
for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence arising out of an
automobile accident occurring on August 5, 2020. 
 
The three named defendants
filed an answer on December 10, 2021.
 
On March 25, 2022, Plaintiff’s
counsel was relieved as counsel of record. 
Plaintiff has been representing himself, in pro per, since then.  
 
On December 10, 2021,
Defendant Eddie’s Trucking, Inc. served Plaintiff with written discovery,
including Form Interrogatories (Set One), Special Interrogatories (Set One),
and Requests for Production (Set One). 
(Kubec Decls., ¶ 2 & Exhs. A.) 
Plaintiff never served responses to these discovery requests.  (Id., ¶ 9.)
 
On May 3, 2024, Eduardo Soya and Eddie’s Trucking, Inc.  (collectively “Defendants”) filed motions to compel responses to the form
interrogatories and special interrogatories. 
Eddie’s Trucking, Inc. filed a motion to compel responses to the
requests for production.  Sanctions are
requested in all three motions.
 
Attached to each of the three motions
is a proof of service, signed by an employee of Defendants’ counsel, stating
that she “caused to be delivered each … document by hand.”  No other proof of service has been filed.
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal
Standard
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit
for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are
required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor
must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
A party must respond to requests for production of
documents within 30 days after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.260,
subd.(a).) If a party to whom requests for production of documents are directed
does not provide timely responses, the requesting party may move for an order
compelling response to the demand. (Id., § 2031.300, subd. (b).) There
is no time limit for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and
confer efforts are required. (See id., § 2031.300; Sinaiko Healthcare
Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th
390, 411.) Nor must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.300, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves
to compel initial responses to requests for production, “the court shall impose
a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against
any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion],
unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2031.300, subd. (c).)
Discussion
 
Eddie’s Trucking served Plaintiff
with Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Request for Production
of Documents in December 2021. (Kubec Decls., ¶ 2 & Exhs. A.) No responses
have been received. (Id.¸¶ 9.)
 
These
motions to compel were filed on May 3, 2024. 
No valid proof of service is attached. 
An employee of Defendants’ counsel declares that she “caused to be
delivered” the documents “by hand” to Plaintiff, but there is no proof of
service or other declaration signed by the process server, and the “caused to
be delivered” declaration by a law firm employee is not a valid or proper proof
of service; if offered to prove that someone else delivered the documents to
Plaintiff outside of the presence of the declarant, it is inadmissible hearsay.
 
Accordingly,
the Court must deny these motions without prejudice, for failure to file a valid
proof of service.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES without prejudice the Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Form
Interrogatories (Set One).

The Court DENIES without prejudice the Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to Special Interrogatories
(Set One).

The Court DENIES without prejudice the Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Respond to
Requests for Production of Documents (Set One).
 
Moving party
is ORDERED to give notice.
