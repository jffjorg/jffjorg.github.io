And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to continue the trial date. The defendant had filed a motion for summary judgment, which was not timely filed. According to California law, the last day for service and filing of a summary judgment motion is 75 days before the last day for hearing. The defendant did not file and serve the motion until April 22, 2024, after the deadline. As a result, the judge has denied the motion to continue the trial date.
