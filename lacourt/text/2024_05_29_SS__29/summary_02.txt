And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the motion to be admitted pro hac vice by Stephen C. Haynes, an attorney licensed in Texas and admitted to practice in the federal courts of the Western and Southern Districts Court of Texas, is denied without prejudice. The reason for the denial is that the applicant has not provided proof of service on the State Bar of California, which is a mandatory requirement. The judge notes that the applicant, Mr. Haynes, is not a member of the California State Bar and does not reside or work in California.
