The court has granted the motion to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment against the defendant. The plaintiff, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, filed a complaint against the defendant, Vardon Joshua Guererro, for subrogation. The parties entered into a written stipulation for the entry of judgment, which would be discharged upon the payment of $14,000. The defendant made some payments, but then stopped, leaving an outstanding balance of $6,500. The court finds that the parties entered into a valid and binding settlement, and that the court retains jurisdiction to enforce the settlement. Therefore, the court grants the motion and enters judgment against the defendant for $6,500.
