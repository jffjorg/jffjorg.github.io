And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Caliber Holdings, LLC's motion to compel Docs Surgery Center to comply with two deposition subpoenas for production of business records. The judge found that the subpoenas were issued by Wand Topco, which was a dismissed party, and therefore, the subpoenas were void. The judge also granted in part Docs Surgery Center's request for sanctions against Caliber Holdings, LLC in the amount of $1,400. The judge ordered Caliber Holdings, LLC to pay the sanctions to Docs Surgery Center.
