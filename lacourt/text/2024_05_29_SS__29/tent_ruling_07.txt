 Case Number:  23STCV01475    Hearing Date:   May 29, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s Motion
to Continue Trial 
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
On January 23, 2023, Juan Romero Rosales (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Luis Giovanni Gordiano (“Defendant”) and Does 1
through 25 for negligence and negligence per se arising out of an automobile
accident occurring on January 19, 2021. 
On filing, the case was assigned a trial date of July 22, 2024.
 
Defendant was served in April 2023.  Defendant appeared and filed a demurrer on
May 17, 2023.  The demurrer was sustained,
with leave to amend, and Plaintiff a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) on June
22, 2023.  
 
Defendant demurred to the FAC.  The Court overruled the demurrer in part and sustained
it in part (without leave to amend) on October 12, 2023.  Defendant filed an answer to the FAC on November
3, 2023.
 
On April 22, 2024, Defendant filed a motion
for summary judgment.
On April 29, 2024, Defendant filed this motion
to continue trial. No opposition has been filed.
Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 128,
subdivision (a)(8), provides that the court has the power to amend and control
its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice. “The
power to determine when a continuance should be granted is within the
discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue, Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44
Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide latitude in the matter of
calendar control including the granting or denying of continuances.” (Park
Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)  
“To ensure the prompt disposition of civil
cases, the dates assigned for trial are firm. 
All parties and their counsel must regard the date set for trial as
certain.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(a).)
“Although continuances of trials are
disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own
merits.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1332(c).)  “The court may grant a
continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the
continuance.”  (Ibid.)  Circumstances that may support a finding of
good cause include:  
“(1) The
unavailability of an essential lay or expert witness because of death, illness,
or other excusable circumstances;  
(2) The
unavailability of a party because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(3) The
unavailability of trial counsel because of death, illness, or other excusable
circumstances;  
(4) The
substitution of trial counsel, but only where there is an affirmative showing
that the substitution is required in the interests of justice;  
(5) The addition
of a new party if: (A) The new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to
conduct discovery and prepare for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had
a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard
to the new party's involvement in the case; 

(6) A party's
excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other material
evidence despite diligent efforts; or  
(7) A
significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case as a result of
which the case is not ready for trial.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c).)  
“In ruling on a motion or application for
continuance, the court must consider all the facts and circumstances that are
relevant to the determination.”  (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)  California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d) sets forth a non-exhaustive list of factors that
the court may consider:  
“(1) The
proximity of the trial date;  
(2) Whether
there was any previous continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to
any party;  
(3) The length
of the continuance requested;  
(4) The
availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the
motion or application for a continuance; 

(5) The
prejudice that parties or witnesses will suffer as a result of the continuance;

(6) If the case
is entitled to a preferential trial setting, the reasons for that status and
whether the need for a continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay; 
(7) The court's
calendar and the impact of granting a continuance on other pending trials; 
(8) Whether
trial counsel is engaged in another trial; 

(9) Whether all
parties have stipulated to a continuance; 

(10) Whether the
interests of justice are best served by a continuance, by the trial of the
matter, or by imposing conditions on the continuance; and  
(11) Any other
fact or circumstance relevant to the fair determination of the motion or
application.”  
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).) 
“A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment
motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.” (Sentry Ins. Co. v.
Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529; accord Cole v. Superior
Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.)
Discussion
The sole basis for
this motion to continue trial is that Defendant’s motion for summary judgment
is set to be heard on April 16, 2025.
The Court may not
refuse to hear a timely filed motion for summary judgment before trial.  (Cole v. Superior Court
(2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88; Sentry Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1989)
207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529.)  But a party
has no right to have an untimely filed summary judgment motion heard before
trial.
Here, Defendant’s motion was not timely filed.  The current trial date is July 22, 2024.  The last day for a hearing on a summary
judgment motion is Friday, June 21, 2024. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (a)(3).) 
The last day for service and filing (assuming personal service) was 75
days before June 21, which was Sunday, April 7, 2024.  (Id., subd. (a)(2).)  As this date falls on a weekend, the last day
for service and filing was Friday, April 5.
Defendant, however, did not file and serve the summary
judgment motion until April 22, 2024.
Accordingly,
Defendant has not shown good cause, based on an untimely filed motion for
summary judgment, to continue the trial date. 
The motion is denied.
Conclusion
The Court DENIES Defendant’s motion to
continue trial. 
Moving Party is ORDERED to give notice.
