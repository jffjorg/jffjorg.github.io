```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the defendants' motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff without prejudice. The plaintiff failed to appear for the deposition, which had been continued multiple times at the plaintiff's request. The defendants are entitled to take the plaintiff's deposition, but the plaintiff has been uncooperative in scheduling the deposition. The defendants must comply with all the mandatory requirements of the applicable statute, including submitting a declaration stating that they have contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance. Since the defendants have not done so, the court must deny the motion to compel on procedural grounds.
