Case No.:  22STCV39318 Hearing Date:  June 7, 2024   [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:   PLAINTIFF SKYRUN CRAFTS CO. LTD’S MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL Plaintiff’s motion to continue trial is DENIED.Moving party to provide notice.FACTUAL BACKGROUND  This is an action for breach of contract and open book account arising from an alleged breach of contract which took place in February 2022. Plaintiff Skyrun Crafts Co., Ltd. and Defendants ST&Company LLC (“ST&Company”) and Raheel Lakhany entered into an agreement in November 2015 wherein Plaintiff would provide goods to Defendants and Defendants would pay for the goods upon the cost provided on each invoice. Plaintiff agreed to provide goods to Defendants on credit and expected Defendants to pay for those goods later. In February 2022, Defendants refused to pay for products that had already been shipped and goods provided on credit. Defendants now owe Plaintiff $136,209.10.PROCEDURAL HISTORY On December 19, 2022, Plaintiff filed its Complaint alleging two causes of action for breach of contract and open book account.On February 14, 2023, Defendants answered.On September 18, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to deem the requests for admissions (“RFAs”) propounded on Defendant ST&Company admitted.On May 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion to continue trial. The motion is unopposed.DISCUSSION Plaintiff moves to continue trial from June 10, 2024 to December 4, 2024 or a date thereafter.Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subdivision (a), “[t]o ensure the prompt disposition of civil cases, the dates assigned for a trial are firm.¿ All parties and their counsel must regard the date set for trial as certain.”¿ Under California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subdivision (b), “[a] party seeking a continuance of the date set for trial, whether contested or uncontested or stipulated to by the parties, must make the request for a continuance by a noticed motion or an ex¿parte¿application under the rules in chapter 4 of this division, with supporting declarations.¿ The party must make the motion or application as soon as reasonably practical once the necessity for the continuance is discovered.”¿  California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subdivision (c) states that “[a]lthough¿continuances of trials are disfavored, each request for a continuance must be considered on its own merits.¿ The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance.”¿ California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, subdivision (d) sets forth factors that are relevant in determining whether to grant a continuance.¿ Here, Plaintiff’s counsel testifies that on October 25, 2023, after the Court granted its motion to deem RFAs admitted and before the deadline for Plaintiff to file a motion for summary judgment, he reserved a hearing date for a motion for summary judgment for the earliest available date of July 8, 2024. (Ma Decl., ¶5.) Plaintiff requests that trial and related discovery and motion dates be continued to after that date. The deadline for Plaintiff to file a motion for summary judgment was February 26, 2024. Although Plaintiff reserved a hearing date for a motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff never filed the motion. The time to file a motion for summary judgment has now passed. Plaintiff fails to explain why the motion was not filed between October 2023 and February 26, 2024. The Court further notes that no motion for summary judgment has been filed as of today. Since Plaintiff failed to timely file a motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff’s motion to continue trial is denied. DATED: June 7, 2024                                                                     ________________________________ Hon.
