```

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court's tentative ruling denies Plaintiff's motions to compel Defendant Ruiya Feng's responses to Form Interrogatories and Special Interrogatories, and to compel further responses to Requests for Production. The court finds that Defendant Feng's original responses to Requests for Admissions and Requests for Production were unverified and untimely, and that her objections were waived. The court also finds that Defendant Feng's supplemental responses to Requests for Production and Special Interrogatories, served in March 2024, were late and contained objections which should have been waived.

The court grants Plaintiff's request for sanctions, awarding a reduced amount of $1,740 for four hours of attorney time at a rate of $450 per hour. The court finds that Defendant Feng's failure to timely serve responses and her waiver of objections constitutes a misuse of the discovery process.
