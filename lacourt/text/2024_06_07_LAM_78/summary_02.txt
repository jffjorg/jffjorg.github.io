And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has denied Plaintiff's motion to continue trial from June 10, 2024 to December 4, 2024 or a date thereafter. The Court found that Plaintiff failed to explain why it did not file a motion for summary judgment between October 2023 and February 26, 2024, and that no motion for summary judgment has been filed as of today. According to California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332, continuances of trials are disfavored, and each request for a continuance must be considered on its own merits. The Court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring the continuance.
