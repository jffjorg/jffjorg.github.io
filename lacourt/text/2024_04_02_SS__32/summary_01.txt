And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is about a motion to compel responses to form interrogatories, set three, filed by Plaintiff Ulrike Zillner against Defendant Maple Street Burbank Homeowners Association. The Plaintiff seeks to compel responses to the interrogatories and requests monetary sanctions. The Defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the Plaintiff should have filed a motion to compel further responses and that the Plaintiff failed to follow the procedures in the Court's Eighth Amended Standing Order. The Court denies the motion to compel and the request for monetary sanctions, finding that the Defendant's unverified responses are not subject to a motion to compel, but rather a motion to compel further under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300.
