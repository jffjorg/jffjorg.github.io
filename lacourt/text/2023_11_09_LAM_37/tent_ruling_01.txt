Background
 
S.W., a minor, by and through her guardian ad litem, Rashunda Pitts
(“Plaintiff”), brings this civil rights action in connection with a “cotton
picking” exercise that took place in the Laurel Span School, which is part of
Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District (“LAUSD”).  The original Complaint alleges that in
September 2017 Defendant Christian Villanueva (“Villanueva”) required other
students to “pick cotton” to experience what African American slaves had
endured as they were reading the autobiography of Frederick Douglass. The
Complaint alleges after this experience, Plaintiff’s mood changed, and she became
very quiet and reserved. The Complaint further alleges Defendant Amy Diaz
(“Diaz”) spoke to Plaintiff’s mother, Rashunda Pitts (“Pitts”), regarding her concerns over the project
but did not confirm that the cotton field would be removed within 24 hours and
failed to further commit to specific timeframes for removal of the cotton
plants. 
Plaintiff’s original Complaint alleged four causes of
action: (1) violation of Article I, Section 7 of the California
Constitution—violation of equal protection; (2) violation of the Unruh Act; (3)
violation of the Bane Act; and (4) negligence against all Defendants. 
 
On
June 8, 2023, Defendants’ demurrer to the Complaint was sustained with leave to
amend. 
On July 6,
2023, Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), alleging two causes
of action: (1) Violation of the Bane Act (Civ. Code §§ 52 and 52.1); and (2) Negligence
(Govt. Code §§ 815.2(a) and 820(a).) 
On September 7,
2023, Defendants filed a demurrer to the FAC. Plaintiff filed opposing papers
on October 30, 2023. Defendants filed a reply on November 2, 2023. The matter
is now before the court. 
 
demurrer to the first amended complaint[1]
 
I.         Legal
Standard
 
A.        Demurrer 
 
A demurrer is an objection to a pleading, the grounds for
which are apparent from either the face of the complaint or a matter of which
the court may take judicial notice. (CCP § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)¿“To survive a demurrer, the complaint
need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary
fact that might eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be
alleged.”¿(C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High School Dist.
(2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.)¿For
the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the
cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly
pleaded.¿ (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962,
966-967.)¿A demurrer “does not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of
fact or law.”¿(Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695,
713.)¿¿ 
 
B.        Motion
to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP § 436(a)-(b); Stafford
v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not
essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be
stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave
to Amend 
 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
 
II.        Request
for Judicial Notice
 
The Court may take judicial notice of records of any court of
record of the United States. (Evid. Code, § 452(d)(2).) However, the court may
only judicially notice the existence of the record, not that its contents are
the truth. (Sosinsky v. Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1565.) 
 
Defendants request judicial notice of the following: 
 
1)

California (“Central District”), Civil Docket for Case No.

Dismissing Case for Lack of Prosecution, dated April 26, 2022, a true and
correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit “B” and incorporated by
reference, and which is located at Entry No. 49 of the docket attached as
Exhibit “A”; and
 
3)

correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit “D” and incorporated by
reference, and which is located at Entry No. 1 of the docket attached as
Exhibit “A”; and
 
5)

6)    
Plaintiff’s Complaint for Damages in the present
action, filed with this Court on August 10, 2022, a true and correct copy of
which is attached hereto as Exhibit “F” and incorporated by reference.
 
Defendants’ request for judicial notice is granted. 
 
III.      Evidentiary
Objections
 
Defendants Object to the Declaration of Na’Shaun L. Neal on
the basis that Lauren K. McRae signed the declaration, and it was not signed
under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California as required by CCP
§ 2015.5. Where a declaration in support of a motion is not signed under
penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California as required by CCP
§ 2015.5, it has no evidentiary value, and a court must not consider it. (See ViaView,
Inc. v. Retzlaff (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 198, 217; see also Kulshrestha v.
First Union Commercial Corp. (2004) 33 Cal.App.4th 601, 610-611 [finding
that nothing in the language of Section 2015.5 suggests that the language of
“under the laws of the State of California” is pointless or optional].) 
 
Defendants’ objections Nos. 1 to 2 are sustained. 
 
IV.       Discussion
 
A.        Plaintiff’s Claims are Time-Barred Under
the Government Claims Act
 
Prior to filing a suit against a public entity, a plaintiff
must comply with the Government Tort Claims Act, which states, in part: “no
suit for money or damages may be brought against a public entity on a cause of
action for which a claim is required to be presented . . . until a written
claim therefor has been presented to the public entity and has been acted upon
by the board, or has been deemed to have been rejected by the board . . .”¿
(Gov. Code, § 945.4)¿¿ 
 
The FAC states that Plaintiff submitted her government claim
for damages to LAUSD on or about November 13, 2017, and that LAUSD did not
respond to accept or reject the claim. (FAC ¶ 3.) Therefore, Plaintiff had two
years from the accrual of the cause of action to file suit, with the cause of
action accruing sometime from September 1, 2017, to October 24, 2017. (Gov.
Code, § 945.6(a)(2).) Plaintiff had to bring this suit no later than October
24, 2019. 
 
On March 7, 2019, Plaintiff brought suit in federal court in
the Central District of California, asserting the same state law claims at
issue in this action. (FAC ¶ 5; RJN Ex. A, D.) Three years later, on April 26,
2022, the Central District of California dismissed the action for lack of
prosecution. (FAC ¶ 5; RJN Ex. A, B.) On August 10, 2022, Plaintiff refiled her
state law claims with this court. (RJN Ex. F.) 
 
Defendants assert that Plaintiff's claims are time-barred
because they are asserted almost 5 years after the cause of action accrued.
Plaintiff argues that the statute of limitations was tolled under Title 28
U.S.C. § 1367(d) during the pendency of the federal action. Since the federal
action was dismissed on July 11, 2022, Plaintiff had 30 days, or until November
13, 2023, to file this action. (FAC ¶¶ 5, 6.) Since Plaintiff filed this action
in state court on August 10, 2022, Plaintiff argues her action is not
time-barred. 
 
28 U.S.C. § 1367 states in relevant part: 
 
(a)
Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided
otherwise by Federal statute, in any civil action of which the district courts
have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental
jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action
within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or
controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution. Such
supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or
intervention of additional parties.
 
(b) In
any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction
founded solely on section 1332 of this title, the district courts shall not
have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection (a) over claims by plaintiffs
against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24 of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure, or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as
plaintiffs under Rule 19 of such rules, or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs
under Rule 24 of such rules, when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over
such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of
section 1332.
 
(c) The
district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim
under subsection (a) if—
 
(1) the
claim raises a novel or complex issue of State law,
 
(2) the
claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims over which the
district court has original jurisdiction,
 
(3) the
district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original
jurisdiction, or
 
(4) in
exceptional circumstances, there are other compelling reasons for declining
jurisdiction.
 
(d) The
period of limitations for any claim asserted under subsection (a), and for any
other claim in the same action that is voluntarily dismissed at the same time
as or after the dismissal of the claim under subsection (a), shall be tolled
while the claim is pending and for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed
unless State law provides for a longer tolling period.
 
Defendants dispute that Plaintiff’s state law claims were
tolled under section 1367(d) because Plaintiff’s dismissal was not a 1367(d)
dismissal, but a dismissal due to failure to prosecute. (RJN Ex. B, C.)
Therefore, the federal court did not decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction
over Plaintiff’s state law claims in the federal action under section 1367(c).)

 
“Section 1367(d) provides for tolling
after dismissal in federal court of supplemental state law claims. Pursuant to
section 1367(a), a federal court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over
state law claims which do not independently come within original federal
jurisdiction but which form part of the same Article III ‘case or controversy.’”
(Peters v. Board of Trustees of Vista Unified School Dist. (S.D. Cal., Aug. 11, 2009, No. CIV 08CV1657-L(NLS)) 2009
WL 2485753, at *3.) Because state law claims are asserted in
a federal action does not mean that the federal district court must exercise
supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims. (See Jinks v. Richland County, S.C. (2003) 538 U.S. 456, 458 [explaining
that under 28 U.S.C. § 1367, the federal district court may exercise
supplemental jurisdiction, not that it must].) 
 
Therefore, “28 U.S.C. § 1367(d) is a
savings provision that tolls the statute of limitations on any state claim over
which a federal court has exercised supplemental jurisdiction until 30 days
after its dismissal, unless state law provides for a longer tolling period.” (Centaur Classic Convertible Arbitrage Fund Ltd. v. Countrywide
Financial Corp. (C.D. Cal. 2011) 878 F.Supp.2d 1009,
1018. For the tolling provision of section 1367(d) to apply, the federal court
must decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims,
pursuant to section 1367(c). (Id. at p. 1019.) 
 
[T]he
statute's legislative history indicates § 1367(d) ‘provides a tolling of
statutes of limitations for any supplemental claim
that is dismissed under this section and
for any other claims in the same action
voluntarily dismissed at the same time or after the
supplemental claim is dismissed.’ [Citations.] Thus, the court in [Parrish v. HBO & Co. (S.D. Ohio
1999) 85 F.Supp.2d 792] concluded that Congress did
not intend the phrase ‘the dismissal’ to include dismissal of the supplemental
state claim by any procedure but, rather, dismissal pursuant to §
1367(c) only.
 
(Ibid.)


The United States Supreme Cout explained that
“§ 1367(d) occurs in the context of a statute that
specifically contemplates only a few grounds for dismissal[.]” (Raygor v. Regents of University of Minnesota (2002) 534
U.S. 533, 534; see also Peters v. Board of Trustees of
Vista Unified School Dist. (S.D. Cal., Aug. 11,
2009, No. CIV 08CV1657-L(NLS)) 2009 WL 2485753, at *3 [“Section 1367(d) tolling
applies when supplemental state law claims are dismissed in federal court pursuant to section 1367(b) or (c) and then
re-asserted in state court. No claims in
the previous case were dismissed pursuant to section 1367.”].)
 
Defendants assert that because
Plaintiff’s federal and state law claims were dismissed due to failure to prosecute,
the dismissal was not pursuant to section 1367(b)
or (c) such that the tolling provisions of section 1367(d) apply.  Thus, Plaintiff’s claims are time-barred. Plaintiff
does not allege that the district court declined to exercise supplemental
jurisdiction over her state law claims such that the tolling provisions of
section 1367(d) apply. 
 
Plaintiff’s reliance on Okoro
v. City of Oakland (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 306 (Okoro) is misplaced because
the dismissal in Okoro was “a section 1367 dismissal[.]” (Id. at
p. 313.) In Okoro, the plaintiff filed suit in federal court but “the
district court dismissed all defendants, except the City, for failure to
properly serve (Fed. Rules Civ.Proc., rule 4) and failure to prosecute (Fed.
Rules Civ. Proc., rule 41(b)).” (Okoro, at p. 308.) Subsequently, the
district court granted “summary
judgment in favor of the City” “as to the federal causes of action (42 U.S.C. §§ 1981,
1983). The court having dismissed the only causes of action over which it had
original jurisdiction, it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over
the remaining causes of action, all of which arose under state law.
The court's order read, in part: ‘Plaintiff is, of course, free to refile such
claims in state court, subject to the tolling provisions of 28 USC § 1367(d).’”
(Id. at p. 309 [italics added].) 
The dismissal in Okoro was a section
1367 dismissal because the district court specifically declined to exercise
supplemental jurisdiction over the plaintiff’s state law claims, which
permitted Plaintiff to refile her claims in state court under the tolling
provision of section 1367(d). Here, however, Plaintiff fails to show that the
dismissal for failure to prosecute was a section 1367 dismissal because the
district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s
claims. Consequently, Plaintiff fails to show that her claims were subject to
the tolling provision of section 1367(d) and are not time-barred. 
 
The demurrer to Plaintiff’s FAC is sustained without leave
to amend. Even if Plaintiff’s claims were tolled, they are subject to demurrer
because they are insufficiently pled. 
 
B.        Plaintiff’s First Cause of Action is
Insufficiently Pled
 
Civil Code, § 52.1 (the “Bane Act”) allows an individual to
sue for damages if a person or persons “interferes by threat, intimidation, or
coercion, or attempts to interfere by threat, intimidation, or coercion, with
the exercise or enjoyment by any individual or individuals of rights secured by
the Constitution or laws of the United States, or of the rights secured by the
Constitution or laws of this state….”¿ (Civ. Code, § 52.1(a), (b).)¿¿“‘The
essence of a Bane Act claim is that the defendant, by the specified improper
means (i.e.,¿‘threat[], intimidation or coercion’), tried to or did prevent the
plaintiff from doing something he or she had the right to do under the law or to
force the plaintiff to do something that he or she was not required to do under
the law.”’¿ (King v. State of Cal. (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 265, 294
citing Austin B. v. Escondido Union School Dist. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th
860, 883.) 
 
Here, the FAC fails to allege that an employee of Defendant
used threat, intimidation, or coercion to force Plaintiff to pick cotton.
Instead, Plaintiff asserts that “Mr. Villanueva did not force her [to] ‘pick cotton’ but that
she had to watch the other students “pick cotton” while she tended to other
crops that were being grown.” (FAC ¶ 22.) There is no showing that Defendants
used threat, intimidation, or coercion. 
 
The
Bane Act was “enacted with hate crimes in mind” and “was intended to address
only egregious interferences with constitutional rights, not just any tort. The
act of interference with a constitutional right must itself be deliberate or spiteful.”
(County Inmate Telephone Service Cases (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 354, 372 (County
Inmate) [internal citations and quotations omitted].) Here, the fact that
Plaintiff was offended by the Cotton-Picking project wherein Plaintiff had to
watch other students pick cotton is not the type of egregious offense that the
Bane Act seeks to address. Furthermore, for there to be a violation under the
Bane Act, the plaintiff must make “a showing of coercion independent from the
coercion inherent in the constitutional violation itself.” (County Inmate,
at p. 369; Shoyoye v. County of Los Angeles (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th
947,958.) The FAC fails to make this showing. 
 
Therefore,
the demurrer to the first cause of action is sustained without leave to amend. 
 
C.        Statutory Governmental Immunity Defenses
Apply
 
The Tort Claims Act draws a clear distinction between the
liability of a public entity based on its own conduct, and the liability
arising from the conduct of a public employee.”
(Zelig v. County of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.4th 1112, 1127.) Although
a public entity may be held vicariously liable under Gov. Code, § 815.2, “the Act contains no
provision similarly providing that a public entity generally is liable
for its own conduct or omission to the same extent as a private person or entity.
Rather, the Act provides that a public entity is not liable for an injury
‘[e]xcept as otherwise provided by
statute....’ (Gov. Code, § 815.)” (Id. at p. 1127 [italics original].)
 
Defendants argue that Government Code §§ 815, 815.2, 818,
820.2, and 820.8 provide immunity from the second cause of action for
negligence. Specifically, Defendants argue that individual Defendants
Villanueva and Diaz are immune from tort liability under Government Code §§ 815.2
and 820.2.
 
Government Code § 815.2 states: 
 
(a) A
public entity is liable for injury proximately caused by an act or omission of
an employee of the public entity within the scope of his employment if the act
or omission would, apart from this section, have given rise to a cause of
action against that employee or his personal representative.
 
(b)
Except as otherwise provided by statute, a public entity is not liable for an
injury resulting from an act or omission of an employee of the public entity
where the employee is immune from liability.
 
Government
Code § 820.2 states: 
 
Except
as otherwise provided by statute, a public employee is not liable for an injury
resulting from his act or omission where the act or omission was the result of
the exercise of the discretion vested in him, whether or not such discretion be
abused.
 
Defendants argue that the FAC alleges discretionary conduct
by an LAUSD teacher and principal because Mr. Villanueva had the discretion to create
a unique lesson plan that included cotton picking. In opposition, Plaintiff
argues that section 820.2 immunity does not apply because Villanueva’s actions were
for “‘the ministerial implementation of [a] basic policy.’ ” (Regents
of University of California v. Superior Court (2018) 29
Cal.App.5th 890, 915 citing Johnson v. State of California
(1968) 69 Cal.2d
782, 796.) 
 
Plaintiff argues that
the Cotton Picking project was not purely discretionary, but a “ministerial implementation”
of standard curriculum planned at the District level, specifically Key Standard
8.9.1. (FAC ¶ 27.) Nothing in Standard 8.9.1, however, requires the
implementation of the Cotton Picking Project, but instead provides an
instructional guide which according to Plaintiffs, reads as follows: 
 
Describe
the leaders of the Abolition Movement (e.g. John Quincy Adams and his proposed
constitutional amendment, John Brown and the armed resistance, Harriet Tubman
and the Underground Railroad, Benjamin Franklin, Theodore Weld, Lloyd Garrison,
Frederick Douglass.) 
 
(FAC ¶ 27.) The “model lesson” also requires students to
read the biography of Fredrick Douglass. (Id.) The “act or omission” of
creating and implementing the Cotton Picking Project “was the result of the exercise of
the discretion vested in” Defendant teacher and principal to implement a school
curriculum. (Gov. Code, § 820.2) 
 
Defendants cites Nicole M. By and Through
Jacqueline M. v. Martinez Unified School Dist. (N.D. Cal. 1997) 964
F.Supp. 1369, for
the proposition that a “[d]ecision by a school principal or
superintendent to impose discipline on students and conduct investigations of
complaints necessarily require the exercise of judgment or choice, and
accordingly are discretionary, rather than ministerial, act.” (Id. at
pp. 1389–1390.) Similarly, in Davison ex rel. Sims v. Santa
Barbara High School Dist. (C.D. Cal. 1998) 48
F.Supp.2d 1225, the district court determined that how a teacher responded to a
racist drawing targeting a specific student was a discretionary act, entitling
the teacher to immunity. (Id. at p. 1232.) Lastly in Wormuth v. Lammersville Union School District (E.D.
Cal. 2018) 305 F.Supp.3d 1108, the district court granted summary judgment in
favor of the superintendent and assistant superintendent accused of negligently
failing to implement school-wide policies finding that “[w]hether a specific
policy is proper under the circumstances is precisely the kind of decision
section 820.2 immunizes.” (Id. at p. 1130.)


How a teacher chooses
to teach their curriculum or implement educational standards are discretionary
acts “which require[] the exercise of
judgment or choice.” (Kemmerer v. County of Fresno
(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1426, 1437 disapproved on other grounds by
Quigley v. Garden Valley Fire Protection Dist. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 798 [citation omitted].) Moreover, Plaintiff
fails to cite authority showing that how a lesson plan or school curriculum is
implemented is a ministerial
implementation of a basic policy not subject to governmental immunity. 
 
Since Defendant Villanueva and Diaz appear immune from
liability, Plaintiff fails to show that LAUSD can be held directly liable for
negligence. 
 
The demurrer to the second cause of action is sustained
without leave to amend. 
 
IV.       Motion to
Strike
 
Notwithstanding
any other provision of law, a public entity is not liable for damages awarded
under Section 3294 of the Civil Code or other damages imposed primarily for the
sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant.


(Gov. Code, § 818.)
 
Defendants contend that punitive and exemplary damages are
prohibited against a public entity and its employees. (Gov. Code, § 818.) While
Plaintiff appears to concede punitive damages are not recoverable against
LAUSD, Plaintiff asserts that because Defendants Villanueva and Diaz are being
sued in both their individual and official capacities, Plaintiff’s claim for
punitive damages survives as the individual defendants being sued in their
individual capacity. 
 
Since the demurrer to the FAC is sustained without leave to
amend, the court grants Defendants’ motion to strike without leave to amend. 
 
Conclusion
 
defendants’ demurrer to the FAC is sustained without leave to
amend. Defendants’ motion to strike is granted without leave to amend. This
case is dismissed with prejudice.
 
Defendants to give notice.
