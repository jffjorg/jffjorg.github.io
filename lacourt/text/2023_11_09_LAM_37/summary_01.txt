  - "The essence of a Bane Act claim is that the defendant, by the specified improper means (i.e., 'threat, intimidation, or coercion'), tried to or did prevent the plaintiff from doing something he or she had the right to do under the law or to force the plaintiff to do something that he or she was not required to do under the law."

Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) is sustained without leave to amend, and the motion to strike is granted without leave to amend. The case is dismissed with prejudice. The ruling is based on the following grounds:

1. The FAC is insufficiently pled, and the Plaintiff fails to show that the dismissal in federal court was a "1367 dismissal" to toll the statute of limitations.
2. The Bane Act claim is insufficiently pled, as there is no showing of threat, intimidation, or coercion.
3. The Governmental Immunity Defenses apply, and the individual defendants are immune from tort liability.
4. Punitive and exemplary damages are prohibited against a public entity and its employees.

The Judge relies on various California and federal statutes, case law, and legal principles to support the ruling.
