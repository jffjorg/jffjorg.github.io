Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer brought by Laurel Canyon Collection, Inc. (Defendant) to the entire complaint filed by Mehrin May (Plaintiff). The Court has sustained the demurrer to the second, third, fourth, and fifth causes of action with 20 days' leave to amend. The Court has also continued the case management conference from April 26, 2024, to August 26, 2024.

The Plaintiff has alleged that Laurel Canyon failed to soundproof the floors in various units, resulting in significant noise from adjacent properties, and seeks damages and injunctive relief. The Defendant has demurred to the entire complaint, arguing that the Plaintiff failed to comply with the requirements of the Davis Stirling Act and that the Complaint does not state a cause of action.

The Court has found that the requirements of Cal. Civ. Code § 5930 are inapplicable to this action, and that the Plaintiff's allegations of breach of contract and negligence are insufficient to state a cause of action. The Court has also sustained the demurrer to the second, third, fourth, and fifth causes of action with 20 days' leave to amend.
