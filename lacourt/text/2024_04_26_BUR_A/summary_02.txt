And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled on the demurrer to the first cause of action for Elder Abuse. The court finds that the allegations in the First Amended Complaint (FAC) do not establish a pattern of neglect or abuse under the Elder Abuse statute. The court notes that the FAC alleges a singular incident of negligence, rather than a pattern of neglect or abuse. The court also finds that the FAC does not allege a causal link between the alleged neglect and the harm suffered by Decedent. The court sustains the demurrer to the first cause of action for Elder Abuse with leave to amend.
