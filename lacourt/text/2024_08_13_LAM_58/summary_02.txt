Significant Statements:
  - "The motion was filed on July 31, 2024, and trial was 61 days away, as it is scheduled to begin on September 30, 2024."
  - "Plaintiffs’ claim that they were ignorant of Sunrise’s role in AVS’s operations is disingenuous."
  - "The Court finds no justification for Plaintiffs’ delay in naming the Sunrise entities, Guez, and Kay."
```

The judge's tentative ruling is to deny the motion for leave to file the Second Amended Complaint. The judge finds that the motion is untimely and that the delay in naming the new defendants is unjustified. The judge also finds that the proposed amendment would require delaying the trial, resulting in added costs of preparation and increased discovery burdens.
