Plaintiff alleges
that around January 2023, he was involved in a motor vehicle accident and
sustained disabilities to his back and neck. 
He promptly informed his supervisor about his disabilities and attended
various doctor’s appointment to treat these disabilities.  On February 1, 2023, after informing his
supervisor regarding a chiropractor appointment, he was terminated from his
employment.  Plaintiff alleges that additional
violations took place throughout his employment with Defendant, including failure
to provide meal and rest periods.
 
Defendant did not
file any responsive pleadings.  On April
18, 2024, default was entered against Defendant CBW.
 
On June 24, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a default judgment application seeking the entry of default
judgment against Defendant.  On the same
day, Does 1 to 100 were dismissed from this action without prejudice.
 
On July 15, 2024,
the Court denied Plaintiff’s default judgment application for failure to file
form CIV-100, substantiate its request for damages, file exhibits in support of
the application, provide a sign memorandum of costs and disbursements, and serve
Defendant with the application or notice of intent to obtain punitive damages.
 
On August 2, 2024,
Plaintiff filed the instant default judgment application.
 
Legal Standard
 
California Rules
of Court, Rule 3.1800 sets forth the requirements for default judgments. In
pertinent part, the rule dictates that a party must use form CIV-100 and file
the following documents with the clerk: (1) except in unlawful detainer cases,
a brief summary of the case identifying the parties and the nature of
plaintiff's claim; (2) declarations or other admissible evidence in support of
the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as necessary; (4) a
memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a declaration of nonmilitary status
for each defendant against whom judgment is sought; (6) a proposed form of
judgment; (7) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or
an application for separate judgment against specified parties under Code of
Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for attorney fees if
allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.  (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800(a)(1)-(9).)

Discussion
 
            The
Court has reviewed the default judgment application filed on August 2, 2024.
 
            The
Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to meet the requirements of California
Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800 in order to obtain entry of default judgment
against Defendant.
 
            First,
Plaintiff has filed a Request for Court Judgment, Form CIV-100.  However, section 7 of the form is incomplete.
 
            Second,
Plaintiff has not submitted sufficient evidence in support of his request for
default judgment.  The evidence presented
includes Plaintiff Torres’ declaration and a text message exchange between
Torres and his supervisor regarding his termination.  However, the evidence presented does not properly
support the amount of damages sought.
 
            Third,
Plaintiff has not properly requested punitive damages.  He has not served the Notice of Intent to
Obtain Punitive Damages pursuant to Civil Code section 425.115(g), which
requires a plaintiff to serve a defendant, who has not appeared in the action,
in the same manner as a summons.  Here,
on August 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed Proof of Service indicating that the default
judgment application, including the Notice regarding punitive damages, had been
served by mail.  Moreover, Plaintiff has
not presented clear and convincing evidence of fraud, malice, or
oppression.  (CACI 3940-3949.)
 
Conclusion
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s default judgment application is DENIED WITHOUT
PREJUDICE.
