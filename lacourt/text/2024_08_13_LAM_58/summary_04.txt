Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court has reviewed the default judgment application filed by Plaintiff Jose Meza Torres against Defendant CBW Doors Inc. The Court finds that the Plaintiff has failed to meet the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800 to obtain entry of default judgment against the Defendant. The Plaintiff has not submitted sufficient evidence in support of his request for default judgment, and the evidence presented does not properly support the amount of damages sought. Additionally, the Plaintiff has not properly requested punitive damages and has not served the Notice of Intent to Obtain Punitive Damages as required by Civil Code section 425.115(g). Therefore, the Court denies the Plaintiff's default judgment application without prejudice.
