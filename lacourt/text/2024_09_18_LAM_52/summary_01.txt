And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on plaintiff Shane Perel-Wertman's motion to compel defendant Liza Perel to serve second further responses to form interrogatories. The court finds that defendant's responses to form interrogatories Nos. 12.1 and 17.1 are sufficient, but her response to form interrogatory No. 15.1 is incomplete. The court orders defendant to serve further verified responses to form interrogatory No. 15.1, parts (b) and (c), within 10 days.

The court also finds that plaintiff's motion to compel further responses is justified, but that defendant acted with substantial justification. Therefore, the court will not impose any sanctions against defendant.

The court notes that defendant served further responses after close of business on July 26, 2024, which was timely, and that plaintiff's opposition was filed one minute late. The court also notes that defendant's counsel, David B. Felsenthal, may be intentionally serving documents late, which is discourteous and uncivil.

Finally, the court finds that plaintiff's request for payment of sanctions in cash is unreasonable and that defendant's amended responses to requests for admission do not violate Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.300.
