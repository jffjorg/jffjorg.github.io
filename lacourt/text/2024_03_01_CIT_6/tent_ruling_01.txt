  Case Number:  22PSCV00804    Hearing Date:   March 1, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff  James Rutherford’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment  Defendants: Rodolfo Gomez and Ana E. Gomez COURT RULING             Plaintiff’s  request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice. . Plaintiff  may submit additional evidence addressing the issues identified by the Court or  submit a new proposed Judgment for the amounts stated in this ruling.            BACKGROUND             This  is an ADA/Unruh Civil Rights Act case. On August 1, 2022, plaintiff James  Rutherford (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Emiliano’s Restaurant  Inc. (Emiliano’s), Rodolfo Gomez (Rodolfo), Ana. E. Gomez (Ana), and Does 1 to  10, alleging one cause of action for violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act,  Civil Code § 51 et seq. On December 19, 2022, Plaintiff filed a Doe amendment  naming Grande Steel Hesperia, Inc. (Grande) as a Defendant. On March 9, 2023,  Plaintiff dismissed Emiliano’s from this action. On November 21, 2023,  Plaintiff dismissed Grande from this action.  On  December 13, 2022, default was entered against Defendants Rodolfo and Ana. On  November 22, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request for entry of default judgment  against Rodolfo and Ana.            LEGAL  STANDARD Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a  proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment  is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil  Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7)  exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by  statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1800.)  ANALYSIS Plaintiff  seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $10,143.00,  including $8,000.00 in damages, $0.00 in interest, $570.00 in attorney fees,  and $1,573.00 in costs. The Court finds Plaintiff has submitted insufficient  evidence to support Plaintiff’s claim for $8,000.00 in damages. Plaintiff seeks  $4,000.00 for the occurrence of the underlying incident in this action on June  24, 2022 and $4,000.00 for deterrence. (Compl., Prayer for Relief, ¶¶ 3-4.) Plaintiff  cites the case of Johnson v. Guedoir (E.D. Cal. 2016) 218 F.Supp.3d 1096  as the basis for requesting $4,000.00 as deterrence damages in addition to the  $4,000.00 for the underlying incident. (Compl., Prayer for Relief, ¶ 4.)  However, the court in Johnson awarded $4,000.00 for deterrence based on  the initial incident and then $4,000.00 for personally encountering the access  violations on a later date. (Johnson, supra, 218 F.Supp.3d at p. 1100.) Here,  Plaintiff only provides evidence of one incident in this action that occurred  on June 24, 2022. (Compl., ¶ 13; Rutherford Decl., ¶ 4.) Plaintiff does not  provide any evidence that the alleged violations continued, and that Plaintiff  had knowledge of such continued violations. "So long as the discriminatory  conditions continue, and so long as a plaintiff is aware of them and remains  deterred, the injury under the ADA continues." (Civil Rights Educ. &  Enforcement Ctr. v. Hosp. Properties Trust, 867 F.3d 1093, 1099.) Therefore,  Plaintiff is at most entitled to $4,000.00 in damages. (Civ. Code § 52, subd.  (a).)  The  Court also finds that, based on the reduced damage calculation, Plaintiff’s  request for attorney fees must also be reduced. (Local Rule 3.214.) The Court  finds the correct amount of attorney fees that Plaintiff can recover here is  $330.00. Plaintiff  also failed to submit sufficient evidence that the court costs were paid.  Plaintiff submitted a Notice of Full Payment of Fees Required showing an unpaid  balance of $1,000.00. (Manning Decl., ¶ 14, Ex. 2.) Plaintiff did not submit  any evidence showing that such balance has been paid. CONCLUSION Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice. . Plaintiff may submit additional evidence addressing the issues identified by the Court or submit a new proposed Judgment for the amounts stated in this ruling.
