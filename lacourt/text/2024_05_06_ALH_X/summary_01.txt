And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the defendants' motion to tax costs is denied. The defendants had requested that the court strike the plaintiffs' memorandum of costs, which included expert witness fees, court reporter fees, and photocopy charges. The defendants argued that these fees were not recoverable and that the plaintiffs had failed to provide adequate documentation to support their request for these fees. The plaintiffs argued that the contracts between the parties permitted the recovery of all costs, including expert witness fees. The court found that the plaintiffs had met their initial burden by submitting a memorandum of costs that appeared to have been proper charges. The defendants failed to provide any evidence to demonstrate that the charges in the memorandum of costs were not reasonably incurred. The court therefore denied the defendants' motion to tax costs.
