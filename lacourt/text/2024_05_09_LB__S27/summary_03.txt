And here is the English-text summary:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in Case Number 23LBCV01728, which was originally scheduled for hearing on March 26, 2024. Prior to the hearing, the Court issued a tentative ruling continuing the hearing and requiring the parties to meet and confer to resolve outstanding issues. However, to date, neither party has filed any further briefs, declarations, and joint statements. The Court has therefore presumed that the parties have resolved their issues and is taking the motion off calendar. The parties are ordered to give notice and indicate their intention to submit on the tentative ruling.
