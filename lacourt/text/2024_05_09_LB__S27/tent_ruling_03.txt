 Case Number:  23LBCV01728    Hearing Date:   May 9, 2024    Dept:  S27 This Court was originally scheduled
to hear this motion on 3/26/24.  Prior to
the hearing, the Court issued a tentative ruling continuing the hearing and
requiring the parties to meet and confer in an effort to resolve all outstanding
issues.  The Court ultimately adopted its
tentative ruling as its final ruling. 
The Court ordered the parties to file briefs, declarations, and a joint
statement of items in dispute if they were unable to resolve their issues.  To date, neither party has filed anything
further.  
 
The Court presumes the parties have
resolved their issues, and is taking the motion off calendar.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the
tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed
off calendar.  If a party submits on
the tentative, the party’s email must include the case number and must identify
the party submitting on the tentative.  If
the parties do not submit on the tentative, they should arrange to appear
remotely.
