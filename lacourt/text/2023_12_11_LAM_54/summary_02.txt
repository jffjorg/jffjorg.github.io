And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer to the cross-complaint filed by Kathleen M. Saylor and Patricia A. Marrero against PG Imtech of California, LLC. The demurrer was filed by PG Imtech, arguing that the cross-complaint is uncertain and fails to state a cause of action. The court has overruled the demurrer, holding that the cross-complaint is sufficient to state a cause of action for declaratory relief regarding the interpretation of the appraisal provision in the option to purchase agreement. The court has also ordered PG Imtech to file and serve an answer to the cross-complaint within 30 days of notice of the ruling.
