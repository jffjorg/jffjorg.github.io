BACKGROUND
               
Plaintiff was employed as the Fire
Chief for the City of West Covina beginning in 2014. Plaintiff alleges that he
was terminated because of his disability and age, for taking CFRA leave, and
for reporting harassment. Plaintiff alleges that certain city councilmembers
colluded to have him terminated.
 
On May 5, 2023, the jury found in favor
of Plaintiff following trial and awarded Plaintiff more than $4,000,000.00 in
damages.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Under Gov. Code § 12965(b), “a
prevailing plaintiff should ordinarily receive his or her costs and attorney
fees unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.” (Williams
v. Chino Valley Independent Fire Dist. (2015) 61 Cal.4th 97, 115.)
 
Plaintiff asserts that Shegerian &
Associates, Inc. incurred $987,920.00 in fees to prosecute this action.
Plaintiff requests that the Court apply a 2.0 multiplier, for a total award of
$1,975,840.00 in fees. Plaintiffs seek $3,000.00 in fees to bring and defend
this motion.
 
1. Multiplier
 
Plaintiff requests the Court apply a 2.0
multiplier to counsel’s fees due to the novelty, difficulty, and skill
displayed in the case and the contingent nature of the case. The Court is
permitted, but not required, to apply a multiplier to an award for attorneys’
fees if, among other factors, there was contingent risk or exceptional skill
displayed by the attorneys. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1138.) In
applying a multiplier for contingent risk, “the trial court should consider whether, and to what
extent, the attorney and client have been able to mitigate the risk of
nonpayment…” (Id.) 
 
The Court declines to award a
multiplier. Employment actions typically present complex facts and contingent
risk; this case was not unusually complex and did not involve unusual risk. The
risks and complexities here do not warrant a doubling of fees.
 
2. Lodestar
 
Plaintiff seeks $987,920.00 in fees to
prosecute this case. Plaintiff’s counsel charges between $600.00 and $1,350.00
per hour and spent more than 1200 hours on this case over approximately three
years. Defendant argues that fees should be reduced for work on unsuccessful
claims, and that counsel’s hourly rates are excessive. The Court does not take
issue with counsel’s hourly rates. The Court also does not find that a
reduction for work performed on unsuccessful claims is appropriate. This action
revolved around the same course of conduct and the same set of core facts;
apportionment is not practicable. The Court finds that counsel’s fees are reasonable.
 
Plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees
is GRANTED in the amount of $987,920.00.
