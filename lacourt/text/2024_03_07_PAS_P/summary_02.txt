And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to quash service of summons in an unlawful detainer case. The defendant, Aleyamma John, failed to pay rent of $97.68 and was served with a three-day notice to quit or pay rent. The plaintiff, Arthur White, served the defendant by posting a copy of the summons and complaint on January 24, 2024, after four unsuccessful attempts at personal service. The defendant argues that the service by posting was not appropriate due to lack of attempts at personal service and alleged false statements in the declaration of non-service. The judge concludes that service by posting was proper in this case, as there is a signed declaration of non-service by the process server and a declaration in support of the opposition signed by the same process server to the contrary. The judge also declines to issue sanctions to either party and denies the defendant's motion to quash service of summons.
