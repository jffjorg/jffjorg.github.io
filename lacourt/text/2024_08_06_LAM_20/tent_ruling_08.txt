This is an action for wrongful termination and violations of the FEHA, UCL, and Labor Code.  Plaintiff Stephanie Davidson now seeks a protective order quashing “defendants’ demand for exchange of expert witness information pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2034.250(a) because it was untimely pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2034.220 and Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.6.”  Specifically, Plaintiff argues that “Defendants[ ] served Plaintiff with their demand exactly 70 days before the trial date, failing to comply with the two-day extension [of time for email service] as required by [CCP § 1010.6].”Code Civ. Proc. § 2034.220 states, “Any party may make a demand for an exchange of information concerning expert trial witnesses without leave of court. A party shall make this demand no later than the 10th day after the initial trial date has been set, or 70 days before that trial date, whichever is closer to the trial date.”Code Civ. Proc. § 1010.6(a)(3)(B) states, “Any period of notice, or any right or duty to do any act or make any response within any period or on a date certain after the service of the document, which time period or date is prescribed by statute or rule of court, shall be extended after service by electronic means by two court days.”Code Civ. Proc. § 2034.250(a) states, “A party who has been served with a demand to exchange information concerning expert trial witnesses may promptly move for a protective order. This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.”The Motion is denied because, as Plaintiff admits, the demand was made exactly 70 days before the trial date as required by CCP § 2034.220.  By its plain language, the two-day extension of time resulting from email service (CCP § 1010.6), applies (a) to notice periods or (b) when the time to take action is measured by the service date.  Neither is at issue.  Item (b) does not apply because here the trial date is the reference point.  Item (a) does not apply because CCP § 2034.220 does not provide for a notice period—rather, it sets a deadline by which the demand must be made.  Plaintiff’s argument would also mean that the discovery cutoffs in this matter would apply two days earlier if there were email service, which is not the law.  In sum, there is nothing that would require that the demand be served 72 days before the trial.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
