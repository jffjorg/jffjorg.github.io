And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Adjudication against Defendant Samuel Luke Llaneras with respect to the first and third causes of action for breach of contract and promissory estoppel. The Plaintiff relies on Llaneras' admissions to demonstrate the lack of a triable issue. The Judge notes that the law of summary judgment provides a mechanism for courts to determine whether trial is necessary to resolve the dispute. The Judge employed a three-step analysis, identifying the issues framed by the pleadings, determining whether the Plaintiff has negated the Defendant's claims, and determining whether the Defendant has demonstrated the existence of a triable, material factual issue. Since the Defendant did not submit an opposition, including a separate statement of undisputed facts, the Motion for Summary Adjudication is granted.
