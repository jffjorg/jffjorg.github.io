And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for a trial preference filed by Plaintiff Joshua Saeta against West Hills Hospital and Medical Center and HCA Healthcare, Inc. The plaintiff seeks a trial date of October 1, 2024, which is also the date set for a related medical malpractice case. The plaintiff's family has been caring for him 24/7 due to his severe anoxic injury and financial hardship, which has taken a toll on his family's mental health. The defendants oppose the motion, citing insufficient declarations, financial hardship not being a basis for preference, and the trial in the related case being irrelevant. However, the judge has granted the motion, finding that the interests of justice will be served by granting a trial preference based on the evidence of the plaintiff's health diminishing due to his family's circumstances. The trial date is set for December 2, 2024.
