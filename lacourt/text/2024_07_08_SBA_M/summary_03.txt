Summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's demurrer to the first amended complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. The court finds that the plaintiffs have failed to state a cause of action and that the firefighter's rule provides a complete defense to each of the plaintiffs' causes of action. The court notes that the parties have engaged in complex analysis of the cause of the fire, which is a distinct policy reason for the implementation of the firefighter's rule. The court also finds that the plaintiffs' attempt to squeeze an exception to the firefighter's rule is unavailing and that the cause of the presence of the fire department was the fire that caused the death of the decedent.
