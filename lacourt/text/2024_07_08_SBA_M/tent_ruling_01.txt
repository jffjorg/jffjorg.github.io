22TRCV00278
1.     
1215 Cerise ZV,
LLC’s Motion for Reconsideration      
 
TENTATIVE RULING

1215 Cerise ZV, LLC’s Motion for Reconsideration is
denied.  
 
Background
 
Plaintiff filed the Complaint on April 12, 2022. Plaintiff
alleges the following facts. The underlying dispute arises out of the
construction of the Cerise Parking Structure located at 12515 Cerise Avenue,
Hawthorne, California 90250 (“Project”). Plaintiff contracted with Defendant
12515 Cerise ZV, LLC (“1215 Cerise”) to act as the designer builder general
contractor. Defendant failed to pay for Plaintiff’s services. Defendant
Hawthorne Creative, LLC is the current owner of the property. On November 30,
2022, Plaintiff and Defendant 1215 Cerise ZV, LLC entered into a written
settlement agreement. On August 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of withdrawal
of notice of settlement. On January 30, 2024, Defendant Hawthorne Creative,
LLC’s motion to enforce the settlement agreement was denied. It should be noted
that Hawthorne Creative’s motion was to enforce the settlement agreement of
Plaintiff and 1215 Cerise.
 
Motion for
Reconsideration
 
CCP § 1008(a) states: “When an application for an
order has been made to a or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or
granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order
may, within 10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of
the order and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make
application to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the
matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order.  The party making the application shall state
by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what judge, what
order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances,
or law are claimed to be shown.”  In
addition, the party seeking reconsideration must provide not just new or
different facts, circumstance, or law, but a satisfactory explanation for the
failure to produce it at an earlier time. See Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 674, 690. 
 
Pursuant to CCP § 1008, Defendant 1215 Cerise moves
for reconsideration of the January 30, 2024 order denying Defendant Hawthorne
Creative, LLC’s motion to enforce settlement agreement. Moving party requests
removal of the following language of the order: “Instead, as part of the
Court's ruling herein, the Court hereby sets aside the dismissal of Cerise's
Cross-Complaint as a condition of rescission.” Moving party requests replacing
that language with the following: “As no application or motion had been filed
as of January 18, 2024 by anyone for any order granting rescission of the
Settlement Agreement or to vacate the dismissal of Cerise’s Cross-Complaint,
this Order is without prejudice to Cerise’s position and arguments concerning
rescission of the Settlement Agreement.”
 
Moving party Defendant 1215 Cerise’s motion for
reconsideration is denied because the moving party fails to provide any new
facts, circumstances, or law to warrant reconsideration of the Court’s prior
order. Instead, Defendant simply disagrees with insertion of the following
language in the Court’s order: “Instead, as part of the Court's ruling herein,
the Court hereby sets aside the dismissal of Cerise's Cross-Complaint as a
condition of rescission.” Defendant argues that no such motion or specific
request to set aside the dismissal of Cerise’s Cross-Complaint was noticed to
be heard on January 18, 2024. However, this assertion does not constitute a new
fact, circumstance, or law, but merely a belief that the Court erred in
inserting the language that Defendant now seeks removed. 
 
In addition, Defendant fails to provide any valid
explanation as to why the purported new facts, circumstances, or law were not
presented earlier. Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 674, 690. In
fact, Defendant appears to concede that this purported new or different fact,
circumstance, or law (which, as noted earlier, is not a new fact, circumstance,
or law) was presented at the time of the hearing date. Defendant candidly
admits that it objected to this portion of the tentative ruling at the hearing
and argued against inclusion of the language. “When it was Cerise’s turn,
Cerise objected to any action on Plaintiff Klorman’s notice of rescission, and
specifically referred the court to the above quoted language. The Court had
Cerise point out the quoted language in the tentative during the hearing.
Cerise objected on due process grounds[.]” (Memorandum of Points and
Authorities, page 5, line 27, to page 6, line 3). Thus, this argument was made
at the time of the hearing. The Court then took the matter under submission and
issued its ruling on January 30, 2024.
 
Finally, the Court notes that 1215 Cerise is certainly
within its right to voluntarily dismiss its Cross-Complaint if it wishes to do
so.
 
1215 Cerise’s motion for reconsideration is denied.
 
In its opposition, Plaintiff requested sanctions
pursuant to CCP § 1008(d) and CCP § 128.7.
 
Request for Sanctions 
 
Code Civ. Proc., § 1008(d) states,
in relevant part: “A violation of this section may be punished as a contempt
and with sanctions as allowed by Section 128.7.” 


Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 128.7, subdivision (a), every pleading, petition, written
notice of motion, or other similar paper must be signed by at least one
attorney of record in the attorney’s individual name or, if the party is not
represented by an attorney, must be signed by the party. An attorney or
unrepresented party who presents a pleading, motion or similar paper to the
court makes an implied “certification” as to its legal and factual merit; and
is subject to sanctions for violation of this certification. The purpose of the
statute is “to check abuses in the filing of pleadings, petitions, written
notices of motions or similar papers.” Musaelian
v. Adams (2009) 45 Cal.4th 512, 514.
 
“By presenting to the court,
whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating, a pleading,
petition, written notice of motion, or other similar paper, an attorney or
unrepresented party is certifying that to the best of the person’s knowledge,
information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the
circumstances, all of the following conditions are met: 
(1) Proper purpose: It is
not being presented primarily for an improper purpose, such as to harass or to
cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation;
(2) Legal merit: The claims,
defenses, and other legal contentions stated in the pleading or other paper are
warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension,
modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law;
(3) Evidentiary support: The
allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if
specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a
reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and
(4) The denials of factual
contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so identified,
are reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.” Code Civ. Proc., §
128.7, subd. (b).
 
A violation of any of these
certifications may give rise to sanctions. (Eichenbaum
v. Alon (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 967, 976.) The certification is designed to
create an affirmative duty of investigation as to both law and fact, and thus
to deter frivolous actions and costly meritless maneuvers. (See Business
Guides, Inc. v. Chromatic Communications Enterprises, Inc. (1991) 498 U.S.
533, 550 [interpreting Federal Rule 11].) Whether the certificate is violated
is tested objectively: i.e., whether the paper filed is frivolous, legally
unreasonable or without factual foundation. “The actual belief standard ...
requires a well-founded belief. We measure the truth-finding inquiry’s
reasonableness under an objective standard and apply this standard both to
attorneys and to their clients.” (Bockrath
v. Aldrich Chem. Co., Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 71, 82.) 
 
A Code of Civil Procedure
section 128.7 motion involves a two-step process. The moving party first serves
the sanctions motion on the offending party without filing it. The opposing
party then has 21 days to withdraw the improper pleading and avoid sanctions
(the so-called “safe harbor” waiting period). At the end of the waiting period,
if the pleading is not withdrawn, the moving party may then file the motion.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7, subd. (c)(1); Martorana
v. Marlin & Saltzman (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 685, 698-699; see Marriage
of Falcone & Fyke (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 814, 826.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 128.7 expressly applies to “petitions” and “pleadings.”
“Pleadings” includes allegations and defenses contained in complaints,
cross-complaints, answers and demurrers. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 420, 422.10.)
 
To avoid sanctions, the
party need only “appropriately” correct the violation. (Code Civ. Proc., §
128.7, subd. (c)(1).) Normally, this means the party must withdraw the
challenged pleading or paper or at least acknowledge its lack of factual or
legal merit at the present time. This can be done either formally or
informally; e.g., by filing amendments to challenged pleadings or declarations,
or formally withdrawing a challenged motion, or simply writing a letter to
opposing counsel stating the challenged argument is withdrawn, etc. Parties who
comply by withdrawing papers that are the subject of a Code of Civil Procedure
section 128.7 motion must notify the moving party of such compliance before the
end of the “safe harbor” period to avoid the imposition of sanctions. Without
such notice, the moving party may not realize the problem has been resolved and
may incur the expense and effort of filing the sanctions motions. (Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. McKenzie
(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 681, 692.) 
 
If the Code of Civil
Procedure section 128.7 certification is violated, the court may impose an
“appropriate” sanction upon the attorneys, law firms or parties responsible for
the violation. (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7, subd. (c).) Sanctions under section 128.7
are discretionary. The court is not required to impose a monetary sanction or
any sanction at all. (See Code Civ.
Proc., § 128.7, subd. (c); See Kojababian v. Genuine Home Loans, Inc.
(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 408, 421.) 
 
Non-monetary sanctions may
include striking the offending pleading; issuing a reprimand; requiring
participation in continuing legal education programs; or referring the matters
to disciplinary authorities. Monetary sanctions include both fines and penalties
payable to the court; and an award to the opposing party for some or all of the
“reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses incurred as a direct result of
the violation.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7, subd. (d).) “If warranted,” the
court may award the prevailing party its reasonable expenses and attorney fees
“incurred in presenting or opposing the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7,
subd. (c)(1).)
 
Sanctions may be awarded
against the persons—whether attorneys, law firms, or parties—who have violated
Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7, subdivision (b), or who are responsible
for the violation. (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7, subd. (c).) “Absent exceptional
circumstances,” a law firm must be held jointly responsible for violations by
its partners, associates or employees, and sanctioned accordingly. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 128.7, subd. (c)(1).) Where the violation consists of meritless
contentions of law (see Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7, subd. (b)(2)), no monetary
sanctions may be awarded against the client. (Code Civ. Proc., § 128.7, subd.
(d)(1); see Cromwell v. Cummings (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th Supp. 10, 13, fn. 4
[“Monetary responsibility for such violations is more properly placed solely on
the party’s attorneys”]; Burkle v. Burkle
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 387, 407.)
 
CCP § 128.7 Safe Harbor
Provision

CCP § 128.7(c)(1) states, in
relevant part: “Notice of motion shall be served as provided in Section 1010,
but shall not be filed with or presented to the court unless, within 21 days
after service of the motion, or any other period as the court may prescribe,
the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, allegation, or denial is not
withdrawn or appropriately corrected.” “A formal noticed motion is required to
begin the 21–day period.” Galleria Plus, Inc. v. Hanmi Bank (2009) 179
Cal.App.4th 535, 538.
 
Here, Plaintiff did not file
and serve a formal noticed motion. 
 
Therefore, the request for
sanctions pursuant to CCP § 1008(d) and CCP § 128.7 is denied.
 
            Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
