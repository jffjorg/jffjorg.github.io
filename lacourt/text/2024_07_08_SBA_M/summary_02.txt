  - "To set aside a judgment based upon extrinsic mistake one must satisfy three elements. First, the defaulted party must demonstrate that it has a meritorious case. Second, the party seeking to set aside the default must articulate a satisfactory excuse for not presenting a defense to the original action. Last, the moving party must demonstrate diligence in seeking to set aside the default once ... discovered."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Chris Don Park's motion to set aside default and quash writ of possession/execution without prejudice. The motion was denied because Defendant did not file and serve a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed, as mandated by CCP § 473(b). The judge noted that Defendant's default was entered due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect, but that Defendant did not demonstrate sufficient grounds for relief under CCP § 473(b).
