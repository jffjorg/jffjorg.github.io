 Case Number:  21SMCV01145    Hearing Date:   January 18, 2024    Dept:  I This is a motion to find the settlement between plaintiff
and Execushield to be in good faith.  It
is unopposed.  
The court notes that the settlement appears to be
straightforward.  The settlement is
$40,000 in return for a full release. 
The court assumes that the entirety of that amount will be available for
offset against any finding against defendants to the extent that any such
finding arises from conduct in which Execushield was involved.  Had there been an opposition, the court would
likely have wanted to see more detail concerning the bona fides of the
settlement under the Tech-Bilt factors. 
But given that no party opposes the motion, the court will find that the
supporting papers are sufficient and GRANT the motion for a good faith
finding.  The proposed order will be
signed.
