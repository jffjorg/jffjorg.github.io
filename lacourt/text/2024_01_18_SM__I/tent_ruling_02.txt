 Case Number:  21SMCV00370    Hearing Date:   January 18, 2024    Dept:  I The court is inclined to GRANT the request, although the
declaration is rather thin.  However, the
court needs to understand the current condition of the case.  If the case has settled, that is one
thing.  If the case has not settled, that
is another, but defendant needs to know that the case will be set for trial
shortly and the trial date is very likely to be soon given that the case is
almost 3 years old.  There likely will be
no continuances based on defendant’s counsel status.
