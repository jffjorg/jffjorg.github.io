 Case Number:  23SMCV03774    Hearing Date:   January 18, 2024    Dept:  I On January 2, 2024, the parties each submitted a form
stating that it was in compliance with the Superior Court’s final status
conference requirements for Limited Jurisdiction cases.  Of course, this is an UNLIMITED jurisdiction
case.  Accordingly, this courts rules on
trials will govern over the limited jurisdiction rules.
The various documents seem generally right, but they are not
jointly filed.  Because this court
requires JOINT filings of FSC documents, the case is NOT READY FOR TRIAL.  The parties will need to meet and confer and
agree on a joint set of papers and, to the extent they cannot, then the papers
will set forth each parties’ position. 
The parties can look at the court’s web site for further guidance.
The court notes its disappointment.  The prior failure to complete FSC materials
was essentially forgiven because the parties represented that they were very
close to a settlement.  The court agrees
that the parties did not guarantee a settlement, but the fact that they are
here again is nonetheless a disappointment as the court was hoping for a
resolution.
The court will set a new FSC date and will require compliant
materials to be timely filed.
