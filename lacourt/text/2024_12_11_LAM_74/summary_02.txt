Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge in a lawsuit brought by Berj Parseghian against Real Ketones, LLC and CVS Pharmacy, Inc. under California's Proposition 65. The defendants demurred to the complaint, alleging that the plaintiff did not meet the statutory pre-suit notice requirements for private enforcement of Proposition 65. The plaintiff argued that providing attorney contact information was sufficient compliance with Proposition 65, while the defendants contended that strict compliance was required. The court granted judicial notice to certain exhibits and struck certain language from the parties' papers. The court ultimately overruled the defendants' demurrer, finding that providing attorney contact information was sufficient compliance with Proposition 65, and ordered the defendants to file their answer within 20 days.
