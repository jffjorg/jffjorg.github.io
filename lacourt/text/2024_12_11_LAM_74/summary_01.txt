And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to compel further responses to form interrogatory No. 2.5. The defendant seeks the plaintiff's address for discovery purposes, while the plaintiff objects on grounds of privacy. The plaintiff's address is protected under Code of Civil Procedure section 367.3, but the court finds that the balance of privacy interests supports compelling a further response. The court grants the motion and orders the plaintiff to serve a response to the interrogatory without objection within 10 days. The court also orders the plaintiff to pay the defendant's counsel $1,867.50 in attorney's fees within 30 days.
