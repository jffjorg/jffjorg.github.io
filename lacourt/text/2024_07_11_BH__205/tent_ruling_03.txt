 Case Number:  24SMCV01779    Hearing Date:   July 11, 2024    Dept:  205    Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles – West District  Beverly Hills Courthouse / Department 205   TANNAZ GERDABI,    Plaintiff, v.  NARIMAN NAIMIAKBAR, et al.,   Defendants.    Case No.:  24SMCV01779     Hearing Date:  July 11, 2024   ORDER RE:   DEFENDANT TANNAZ GERDABI’S    MOTION TO SEAL COMPLAINT       BACKGROUND This hearing is on Defendant Nariman Naimiakbar’s motion to seal a four-page complaint filed by Plaintiff Tannaz Gerbadi.  The complaint alleges that Defendant committed battery against Plaintiff.  Defendant is the Chief Executive Officer of a burgeoning technology company.  The company and its officers are regularly being reviewed by the business community for possible investment and/or partnership.  Defendant claims he will be prejudiced if the Complaint is available to the public, and this overriding interest overcomes the right of public access to the records.  There is no opposition filed as of the posting of this tentative ruling.     DISCUSSION An application to seal must be accompanied by a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify sealing. (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 2.551(b)(1).)  Plaintiff has submitted the declaration of Matthew Esposito which fails to explain the facts which justify sealing.  The declaration merely states that the parties entered into a settlement and agreed to seal the complaint in this action.  The parties filed a joint stipulation to seal the Complaint which the Court denied, referring to the need for good cause to be shown.  Good cause still has not been shown.        CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Defendant’s motion to seal.   IT IS SO ORDERED.  DATED: July 11, 2024    ___________________________ Edward B.
