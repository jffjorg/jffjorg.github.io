Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The Court has considered the Defendants' motion to compel the deposition of Ronald Ming, a physical therapist, personal trainer, and owner of FulHaus gym, where the Plaintiff, Tara Steudemann, was a member. The motion was filed on June 7, 2024, and the Court has determined that it is timely. However, the Court finds that the motion is not supported by a meet and confer declaration, as required by statute. The Court also notes that the motion was served electronically on the Plaintiffs' counsel, but there is no evidence that Mr. Ming was personally served with the motion.

The Court has denied the motion to compel, citing the lack of personal service on Mr. Ming. The Court also notes that the Defendants' counsel did not meet and confer with Mr. Ming on the grounds for their motion, as required by statute. The Court cautions counsel to comply with the statutory requirements in the future. The motion to compel and request for sanctions against Mr. Ming are denied.
