And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling by Judge Edward B. Moreton, Jr. denies Defendant Nariman Naimiakbar's motion to seal a four-page complaint filed by Plaintiff Tannaz Gerdabi. The complaint alleges that Defendant committed battery against Plaintiff. Defendant argues that he will be prejudiced if the Complaint is available to the public, as his technology company and its officers are being reviewed by the business community. However, the Court finds that Defendant has failed to provide sufficient facts to justify sealing the Complaint, despite the parties' agreement to do so. The Court cites Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 2.551(b)(1), which requires an application to seal to be accompanied by a declaration containing facts sufficient to justify sealing. As a result, the Court denies Defendant's motion to seal.
