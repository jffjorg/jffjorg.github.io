And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Catherine Townsend's special motion to strike Adam Tenser's first amended complaint, which alleges slander. The judge finds that Townsend's reporting on the murder trial of Blake Leibel, including her podcast "Blood Money", is protected by the fair report privilege. The judge also finds that Tenser, as a limited public figure, must plead and prove clear and convincing evidence of actual malice, which he has not done. Therefore, the judge concludes that Tenser's claims are without merit and grants the special motion to strike.
