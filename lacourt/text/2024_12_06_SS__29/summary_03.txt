And here is the summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to set aside the dismissal of the complaint filed by Andrew Sandoval against Starbucks Corporation. The complaint was originally dismissed due to Plaintiff's counsel's failure to appear at a hearing, but the Court granted a motion to set aside the dismissal based on a calendaring error. The Court finds that the failure to appear was due to excusable neglect and grants the motion to set aside the dismissal. The Court also imposes a fine of $250 on Plaintiff's counsel, Robert L. Booker II, Esq., and orders him to pay it to the State Bar Client Security Fund. The Court sets a trial setting conference for February __, 2025, and an Order to Show Cause re Why the Court Should Not Impose Monetary Sanctions on Plaintiff and/or Plaintiff's Counsel in an Amount Up To $500 For Failure to Serve Defendants for the same date.
