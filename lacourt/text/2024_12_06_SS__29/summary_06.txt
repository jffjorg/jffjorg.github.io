And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion filed by plaintiff's counsel, Francis Cowhig, to be relieved as counsel. The motion is granted due to Cowhig's health reasons, specifically his macular degeneration condition that renders him unable to effectively read, write, and represent the plaintiff. The court finds that Cowhig has met all substantive and procedural requirements for the motion, and thus, the motion is granted. The order will be effective upon filing with the court a proof of service showing service of the signed order on the client.
