And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petition for approval of a minor's compromise and proposed orders filed by Charlee Katz, a 16-year-old claimant. The judge finds that there are several issues that need to be addressed before the petition can be approved. Specifically, the judge notes that the petition and orders contain incorrect information, including the claimant's birthday and the amount of money to be reimbursed from liens. The judge also finds that the declaration of Brent Gerome, a medical provider, is unclear and does not sufficiently address the factors listed in the California Rules of Court. As a result, the judge continues the hearing and sets a new date for __/__/2025 at 01:30 P.M. in Department 29 at the Spring Street Courthouse.
