22STCV32545
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, filed by Plaintiff’s
Counsel Francis Cowhig
Tentative
The motion is granted.
Background
On October 4, 2022, Liying Zou (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Noel Contreras and Does 1 through 10 for negligence
and negligence per se under Vehicle Code section 22350 arising out of an
automobile accident occurring on October 7, 2020.
At the Final Status Conference on March 19,
2024, Plaintiff’s counsel appeared.  The Court
determined that no proof of service had been filed, placed the Final Status
Conference off calendar, vacated the trial date, and set an OSC re Dismissal
for Failure to File Proof of Service on June 21, 2024.  The Court subsequently continued the hearing on
the OSC to October 4, 2024, and again to January 14, 2025.
On June 25, 2024, Plaintiff amended the
complaint to correct the name of the defendant to Pedro Contreras.
On November 4,
2024, Francis Cowhig (“Counsel”) filed this
motion to be relieved as counsel. No opposition has been filed. No defendant
has appeared in this action.
 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has
filed the Notice, Declaration, and Order to be relieved as counsel for
Plaintiff. Counsel contends that due to his macular degeneration condition in
both his eye, he can no longer effectively read, write, and represent
Plaintiff. 
The Court finds
Counsel has met all substantive and procedural requirements with this motion to
be relieved as counsel. Counsel has provided good cause to be relieved as
attorney of record due to health reasons.
Accordingly, the
motion is GRANTED. 
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is GRANTED. 
The order is
effective upon filing with the Court a proof of service showing service of the
signed order (not just the minute order) on the client.
Moving counsel
to give notice.
