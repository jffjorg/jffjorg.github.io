 Case Number:  22STCV08187    Hearing Date:   December 6, 2024    Dept:  29 Sandoval v. Starbucks Corporation
22STCV08187
Motion to Set Aside Dismissal filed by Plaintiff Andrew Sandoval. 
Tentative
The motion is GRANTED.
Background
On March 7,
2022, Plaintiff Andrew Sandoval (Plaintiff) filed a complaint against
Defendants Starbucks Corporation, and Does 1 to 50, for premises liability and
negligence.  
On August
21, 2023, the Court held a final status conference. There were no appearances
by either party. On September 5, 2023, the case was called for trial and there
were no appearances. As a result, the Court dismissed the complaint filed by
Plaintiff pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 581(b)(3). (Min. Order,
9/5/23.) 
On February
26, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion to set aside the dismissal,
based on a calendaring error. (Min. Order, 2/26/24.)  
Then, on
April 9, 2024, the Court held an Order to Show Cause Re: Dismissal and/or
Sanctions for Failure to Serve. There was no appearance by counsel for
Plaintiff and no service in this case. As a result, the Court again dismissed
the complaint without prejudice. 
On October
10, 2024, Plaintiff filed the instant motion to set aside the dismissal under
Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b). No opposition has been filed. 
Legal Standard
Under Code of Civil Procedure section
473(b), the Court may relieve a party from a dismissal taken against him
through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  This application must be filed no more than
six months after entry of the order from which relief is sought, and must
contain an affidavit of fault demonstrating the moving party’s mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. 
 
A mistake is a basis for relief under
section 473 when by reason of the mistake a party failed to make a timely
response.  Surprise occurs when a party is unexpectedly placed in a
position to his injury without any negligence of his own. Excusable neglect is
a basis for relief when the party has shown some reasonable excuse for the
default.  (Credit Managers Association of California v. National
Independent Business Alliance (1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 1166, 1173; Davis v.
Thayer (1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 892, 905.)  Under Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, the moving party bears the burden of demonstrating an excusable
ground, such as fraud or mistake, justifying a court’s vacating a
judgment.  (Basinger v. Roger & Wells (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 16,
23–24.)   
 
Relief under this section is mandatory when based on an
attorney affidavit of fault; otherwise, it is discretionary. (Id.) The
mandatory relief provision does not apply to dismissals for “failure to
prosecute [citations omitted], dismissals for failure to serve a complaint
within three years [citations omitted], dismissals based on running of the
statute of limitations [citations omitted], and voluntary dismissals entered
pursuant to settlement [citations omitted].” (Leader v. Health Industries of America, Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 603, 620.) 
 
Discussion
 
Here, Plaintiff’s counsel, Robert L. Booker II,
declares that following the February 26, 2024 order to set aside the first
dismissal, Plaintiff’s counsel conveyed to his paralegal that an Order to Show
Cause was set for April 9, 2024. (Booker Decl. ¶ 5.) The paralegal was
instructed “to provide notice to Defendants, file the Proof of Service and
calendar the hearing of the Order to Show Cause re Monetary Sanctions and/or
Dismissal due to failure to Serve. Unfortunately, the hearing date was not
calendared, and Plaintiff’s counsel missed the hearing of the OSC that was held
on April 9, 2024. Plaintiff’s counsel also failed to provided notice to
Defendants.” (Id.) Furthermore, Plaintiff provides evidence this motion
was made within a reasonable time because Plaintiff did not learn of this
dismissal until after an October 2024 audit. (Id. ¶ 8.) 
 
A calendaring
error constitutes excusable neglect. (Nilsson v. City of Los Angeles
(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 976, 980.) Because the date was not calendared,
Plaintiff’s counsel was unaware and did not appear at the OSC. Therefore,
Plaintiff sufficiently shows that failure to appear was due to excusable
neglect. 
 
Therefore, the
Court grants the motion to set aside the dismissal. 
 
When a motion is
granted under section 473, the Court may (among other things) order that the “offending
attorney pay an amount no greater than one thousand dollars ($1,000) to the
State Bar Client Security Fund.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 473, subd (c)(1)(B).)
 
The Court
exercises its discretion to order attorney Robert L. Booker II, Esq., to pay $250
to the State Bar Client Security Fund by January 6, 2025.

Sandoval’s motion to set aside the dismissal.
