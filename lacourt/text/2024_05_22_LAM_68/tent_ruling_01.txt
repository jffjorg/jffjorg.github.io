  Case Number:  22STCV33658    Hearing Date:   May 22, 2024    Dept:  68 Dept. 68 Date: 5-22-24 Case #: 22STCV33658 Trial Date: 1-9-25 c/f 6-24-24  FURTHER INTERROGATORIES  MOVING PARTY: Defendant, Samuel Welch RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiff, Shamoria Jackson  RELIEF REQUESTED Motion to Compel Further Responses to Form Interrogatories (set one)  SUMMARY OF ACTION Plaintiffs were tenants of a single family dwelling at 32270 Saticoy Street, West Hills, and allege unsanitary and/or unsafe conditions on the premises as a result of improper maintenance and upkeep.   On October 17, 2022, Plaintiffs filed their complaint for Failure to Provide Habitable Dwellings, Breach of Covenant of Right to Quiet Enjoyment and Possession of the Property, Nuisance, and Negligence. Defendants answered the complaint on February 23, 2023.  RULING: Granted. Defendant, Samuel Welch moves to compel further responses to form interrogatories (set one), numbers 9.1, 9.2, 10.3, and 12.4 from Plaintiff Shamoria Jackson. The responses consist of incomplete replies, with assurances of later production upon entry into a protective order, or references to other parties and non-parties responsible for the provision of information.   The responses are incomplete and fail to respond to all subcategories of the requests. Plaintiff makes no actual objection on privacy. The reliance on the purported protective order in no way excuses the incomplete responses.   The motion is therefore granted. Responding is ordered to serve responses in compliance with Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.210-20310240. No sanctions requested.   The court calendar shows 13 scheduled motions to compel further responses scheduled through July 22, 2024. The motions appear as a continuation of discovery issues addressed by the court in the 23 motions to compel responses granted on November 22, 2023.  The court does not conduct any informal discovery conferences. While the court understands the prior use and perhaps reliance on the IDC system, the court finds the number of items on the court calendar through the next three months presents a potentially inordinate burden. The court reserves the right to set an OSC re: Discovery Referee in lieu of a hearing on any given motion, and may take off any and all motions in lieu of the OSC hearing. The court invites the parties to continue meeting and conferring, including the provision of supplemental responses, when possible.   Next motion to compel further responses to request for production of documents from Shamoria Jackson on May 29, 2024.   Defendant to give notice.
