Plaintiff was born on May 17, 1999. Berendt was arrested in 2012 for the alleged molestation of numerous students on the campus.  On October 3, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; Negligence; Negligent Supervision; Negligent Hiring/Retention; Negligent Failure to Warn, Train, or Educate; Breach of Fiduciary Duty; Constructive Fraud; Sexual Battery; and, Sexual Assault. Defendant Berendt, in pro per, answered the complaint on November 27, 2023. On January 29, 2024, the action was transferred from Department 30 (Personal Injury) to an independent calendar court. On January 31, 2024, the case was assigned to Department 68.  On February 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; Negligence; Negligent Supervision; Negligent Hiring/Retention; Negligent Failure to Warn, Train, or Educate; Breach of Fiduciary Duty; Constructive Fraud; Sexual Battery; and, Sexual Assault.  On July 26, 2023, the court deemed 23STCV14520 related to 22STCV18640. On February 23, 2024, a notice of related cases was filed with 22STCV382369, 23STCV02661, and 23STCV14520. On July 26, 2023, the court deemed 23STCV14520, John VKB Doe v. Doe 1, related, with 22STCV18640 deemed the lead. On December 20, 2023, the 23STCV14520 complaint was dismissed without prejudice. On February 22, 2024, the court consolidated 22STCV18640 with 22STCV38269, John MGB Doe and 23STCV02661, Jane HAB Doe. On February 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of related cases with 22STCV38268, 23STCV02661, and 23STCV14520. On April 29, 2024, the court deemed 23STCV23998 related to 22STCV18640, 22STCV382369, with 22STCV18640 deemed the lead case.   On May 2 ,2024, Plaintiff dismissed Richard Lopez with prejudice. On May 6, 2024, Hilda Higgins answered the first amended complaint. John Deasy answered on May 10, 2024.  RULING: Granted in Part/Denied in Part. Request for Judicial Notice: Granted. The court takes judicial notice of the publication of the articles, but nothing in the content for the truth of the matter asserted on any item addressed in the subject motion.  Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) moves for protective order or alternative motion to quash 11 deposition subpoenas served on both third parties or party defendants (1) Hilda Higgins; (2) Dr. John Deasy, past Superintendent for the School District; (3) Michael Hopwood; (4) Danilo Escalante; (5) Holly P. Diaz; (6) Loren Vivero; (7) Lisa Gil; (8) Shayla Lever; (9) Susan Geisen; (10) Walter Flores; and (11) Dr. George McKenna, current member of the School District Board of Education. LAUSD moves on a number of grounds including, premature timing as to defendant Higgins, apex doctrine as to Deasy and McKenna, and general claims of “abusive” discovery tactics.   Plaintiffs in opposition maintains the necessity for the depositions. Plaintiff agrees to the use of prior deposition testimony, where applicable, but only on condition of an agreed upon expedited trial date. Plaintiff denies application of the apex rule to McKenna and Deasy. Plaintiff requests sanctions.  LAUSD in reply reiterates the offer for a stipulation to utilize prior deposition testimony. LAUSD vigorously maintains the lack of any new information. LAUSD notes the lack of opposition characterizing Deasy and McKenna as alpha level employees, thereby requiring efforts of alternative means of discovery.   “If a subpoena requires the attendance of a witness … the court, upon motion reasonably made by any person described in subdivision (b), … may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective orders. In addition, the court may make any other order as may be appropriate to protect the person from unreasonable or oppressive demands…” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (a).) A Court may make any order that justice requires to protect a party from “unwanted annoyance, embarrassment or oppression or undue burden and expense.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.420, subd. (b).) A deponent may seek that the deposition is not taken at all, the deposition only taken on specified terms and conditions, or only certain matters are allowed for inquiry. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.420, subd. (b)(1)(5)(9).) The burden of proof is on the party seeking the protective order to show “good cause” for the order he or she seeks. (Fairmont Insurance Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)    A motion for a protective order “shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.420, subd. (a).) “A meet and confer declaration in support of a motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.) The motion contains a sufficient meet and confer effort. [Declaration of Henry Gonzalez, Ex. B.]   The notice of deposition on Hilda Higgins shows a date of February 8, 2024—one day after substituting Higgins for Doe 2. Higgins was not served with the summons and complaint via substituted service until April 5, 2024. Higgins answered the first amended complaint on May 6, 2024. “The plaintiff may serve a deposition notice without leave of court on any date that is 20 days after the service of the summons on, or appearance by, any defendant. On a motion with or without notice, the court, for good cause shown, may grant to a plaintiff leave to serve a deposition notice on an earlier date.” (Code Civ. Proc., 2025.210, subd. (b).) The deposition notice on a now party defendant was premature. The motion is therefore granted on this basis. Plaintiff may serve new notice of a deposition.  For John Deasy and George McKenna, the court addresses the apex doctrine standard. “It is the general rule in both California and federal courts that the heads of agencies and other top governmental executives are normally not subject to depositions. (Citations.)” [¶] “‘An exception to this general rule exists concerning top officials who have direct personal factual information pertaining to material issues in an action. [Citations.] [¶] A top governmental official may, however, only be deposed upon a showing that the information to be gained from such a deposition is not available through any other source. [Citations.]’ (Citation.)” (Nagle v. Superior Court¿(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1465, 1467–1468; see Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1282, 1289.)   Assuming Deasy remains an employee with the district, while conceding that Deasy no longer serves as the superintendent, LAUSD continues to maintain apex doctrine protects former position holders. LAUSD cites to the leading case considering the appearance of a former director. (Nagle v. Superior Court, supra, 28 Cal.App.4th at p. 1467.) In considering both the current and former director of the California Employment Development Department, the court cited to the policy foundation of the apex employee protections: “... an official's time and the exigencies of his everyday business would be severely impeded if every plaintiff filing a complaint against an agency head, in his official capacity, were allowed to take his oral deposition. Such procedure would be contrary to the public interest, plus the fact that ordinarily the head of an agency has little or no knowledge of the facts of the case.” (Id. at p. 1468.)   The first part of the test lacks applicability given Deasy no longer serves as superintendent. The court finds analogous support in the second part regarding a showing of knowledge of facts of the case. The court finds a lack of support for the necessity of direct deposition testimony without first establishing a lack of the required information from other sources. “Thus, where a party seeks to depose a high government official, and the official moves for a protective order, the burden is on the deposing party to show that compelling reasons exist for permitting the deposition.” (Contractors' State License Bd. v. Superior Court (2018) 23 Cal.App.5th 125, 132.)  As for George McKenna, LAUSD relies on the argument that a current member of the School District Board of Education, McKenna also qualifies for apex level status. The court finds no legal support or factual, granular distinctions between a superintendent or clear head of an agency versus a board member overseeing a district. The court accepts the implied argument that a board member may or may not be privy to key information regarding specific teacher misconduct or school administration matters for a single campus.  Regardless, Plaintiff offers no legal or factual dispute to the application of the apex doctrine to the two witnesses, and instead only maintains the witnesses hold exclusive information necessitating the depositions. The court declines to make a determination on the unchallenged claim as to board member McKenna, and instead accepts the position for purposes of the motion.   Plaintiff’s conclusive position regarding necessary knowledge lacks any specific articulation regarding efforts to obtain the information regarding knowledge of the exact case from any and all alternative sources and the insufficiency of such efforts. The court therefore grants the protective order given the lack of sufficient support as to the current action. (Ibid.)  On the challenge by LAUSD suggesting the former depositions should be relied upon for purposes of the deposition, the court finds no basis of support on this specific ground. A party remains entitled to conduct discovery into each and every filed action, without any required reliance on former testimony. Plaintiff’s counter-offer of an “expedited” trial date lacks applicability: the action is not even at issue and demurrer appears scheduled.   The court otherwise finds no basis to preclude Plaintiff from seeking new depositions as party defendants or witnesses. A party may object to the introduction of former deposition testimony, thereby justifying the potential need for case specific discovery. The court declines to offer a potential advisory opinion on the admissibility of former deposition testimony.  The motion lacks any alternative basis of support regarding the “abusive discovery tactics” contention. Again, the court finds the existence of prior deposition testimony in a prior case in no way vitiates the rights of a new party to seek discovery in the instant action. The motion for protective order as to the non-apex witnesses is therefore denied.  In summary, the motion for protective order is granted as to the apex witnesses, McKenna and Deasy, as well as prematurely served defendant Higgins, and denied as to the remainder. The parties may still stipulate to the use of former deposition testimony, but again, the court in no way rules on any consideration regarding the use of said testimony in lieu of depositions as to this Plaintiff. Request for sanctions by Plaintiff denied.  The court does not conduct independent discovery conferences. The court invites the parties to consider a discovery referee if supervised depositions become required. Nothing in this order precludes the parties from executing a stipulation in exchange for bringing the case at issue without further challenge.   Case Management Conference and OSC re: Failure to File Proofs of Service set for July 10, 2024, with a motion for trial preference scheduled for July 17, 2024. Motion to compel compliance with subpoena as to LAUSD counsel Andrade Gonzalez also on calendar for August 20, 2024.   LAUSD to give notice.
