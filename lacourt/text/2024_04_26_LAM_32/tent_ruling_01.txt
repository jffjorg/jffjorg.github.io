     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant energy roofing, inc.’s motion
  to compel responses (CRS# 7798)




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On April 26, 2023, Plaintiff
American Builders & Contractors Supply Co., Inc. filed this action against
Defendants Energy Roofing, Inc., Nadav Marciano, and Arturo Suarez. The
complaint asserts causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2) open book
account, and (3) account stated. The action arises from Defendants’ alleged
failure to pay for construction materials provided by Plaintiff. 
            On March 28, 2024, Defendant Energy
Roofing, Inc. filed the instant motion to compel responses to its special
interrogatories. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Discovery responses are due 30 days after
service of the requests, unless the parties stipulate or the court orders
otherwise. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a), 2033.250(a).) If a
responding party fails to respond in time, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling the responses or deeming matters admitted. (Id., §§
2030.290(b), 2031.300(b), 2033.280(b).) The responding party also waives its
objections. (Id., §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), 2033.280(a).)  
DISCUSSION
            Defendant served the subject
discovery on December 7, 2023. (Chemerinski Decl. ¶ 1.) Plaintiff served
belated, unverified responses on March 12, 2024. (Id., ¶ 5.) Defendant
granted an extension to March 21, 2024 for Plaintiff to provide verified
responses. (Id., ¶ 6.) Plaintiff did not provide verified responses by
March 21, 2024. (Id., ¶ 7.) This motion followed. 
            Unverified responses are tantamount
to no response at all. (Appleton v. Super. Ct. (1988) 206
Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) Therefore, Plaintiff has failed to provide any responses
to the special interrogatories, even after Defendant’s voluntary extension.
Plaintiff does not oppose the motion and has provided no substantial
justification. Sanctions are warranted in the amount of $900, representing 3
hours at $300 per hour. (See Chemerinski Decl. ¶ 8.) 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s motion to compel
responses is GRANTED. Plaintiff shall provide responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One within 15 days of this order. Objections are waived
except for privacy and privilege. The Court sanctions Plaintiff and its counsel
in the total amount of $900, to be paid within 30 days of this order.
