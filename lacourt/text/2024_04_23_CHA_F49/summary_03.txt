And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion filed by Defendant Jimmy Deans' counsel, Sue M. Bendavid, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed on March 6, 2024, and no opposition papers were received by the court. The motion was necessitated by a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and a breakdown in communication. However, the court found that the motion was not properly filed as the proposed order was not lodged with the court. As a result, the court denied the motion.
