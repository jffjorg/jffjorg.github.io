Jimmy Deans, James  Axotis,  Isahi Sierra, and  Does  1-100 Case # 23CHCV00243   LOS  ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT NORTH  VALLEY DISTRICT DEPARTMENT  F49    APRIL 23,  2024    MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL  Los Angeles Superior Court Case # 23CHCV00243    Motion  filed: 3/6/24   MOVING PARTY: Defendant’s counsel Sue M. Bendavid (“Counsel”)  RESPONDING PARTY: None  NOTICE: ok    RELIEF  REQUESTED: An  order relieving counsel Sue M. Bendavid as counsel for Defendant Jimmy Deans.   TENTATIVE  RULING: The  motion is DENIED.   BACKGROUND   On January 30, 2023, Plaintiff Destiny Leon filed this  action against Defendants Jimmy Deans, James Axotis, Ishi Sierra, and Does 1  through 100, alleging the following causes of action: (1) Sexual Harassment –  Hostile Work Environment in Violation of FEHA, (2) Discrimination in Violation  of FEHA, (3) Failure to Prevent Harassment and Discrimination in Violation of  FEHA, (4) Negligent Supervision and Retention, and (5) Wrongful Constructive  Termination in Violation of Public Policy. Subsequently, on February 7, 2024,  Defendants Jimmy Deans and Isahi Sierra filed their Answer to the Complaint.   On March 6, 2024, Counsel filed the instant Motion to be Relieved as Counsel (the “Motion”).   No opposition papers have been received by the Court.   ANALYSIS The court may  order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or after  judgment or final determination upon request by either client or attorney and  after notice from one to the other. (Code Civ. Proc. § 284, subd. (2).) “The  determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies  within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v. Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128,  1133.) An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial  Counsel Forms MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and  MC-053 (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c),  (e).)             In  addition, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 subsection (d) requires that  the notice of motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order be served on  the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case by personal service,  electronic service, or mail. If the notice is served by mail, it must be  accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing that either:             (A)  The service address is the current residence or business address of the client;  or (B) The  service address is the last known residence or business address of the client  and the attorney has been unable to locate a more current address after making  reasonable efforts to do so within 30 days before the filing of the motion to  be relieved.             (Cal. Rules of  Court, rule 3.1362, subd. (1)(A) & (2).)   Here, Plaintiff’s Counsel has filed Judicial Counsel Forms  MC-051 and MC-052. Counsel has provided a declaration stating that the Motion  is necessitated by a “breakdown in attorney-client relationship” and “breakdown  in communication.” (MC-052, ¶ 1.)    On the MC-052 (Declaration), it  indicates that Counsel has confirmed Defendant’s last known address within the  last 30 days by mail, return receipt requested. (MC-052, ¶ 3b.(1)(a).)    However, Counsel failed to lodge Judicial Counsel Form  MC-053 (Proposed Order) with the Court, thus not complying with California  Rules of Court rule 3.1362(e).   Therefore, the Court DENIES Counsel’s Motion to be Relieved  as Counsel.   CONCLUSION   Defendant Jimmy Deans’s Counsel Sue M. Bendavid’s Motion to  be Relieved as Counsel is DENIED.   Counsel is ordered to give notice.
