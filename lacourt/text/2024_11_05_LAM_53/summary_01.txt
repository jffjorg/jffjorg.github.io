And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a motion by AIDS Healthcare Foundation (Defendant) to uphold the "confidential" designation of certain videos and documents produced in discovery. The Defendant produced these documents in response to a request for discovery by the Plaintiffs, Annette Turner and Tammy Davis. The Plaintiffs objected to the confidential designation, but the court found that the Defendant had met its burden to establish the applicability of the confidential designation.

The court found that the documents in question consist of videos and information that concern the privacy rights of non-parties, and that the Defendant's residents had a legally protected privacy interest and an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy. The court disagreed with the Plaintiffs' contention that the residents did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy because the conduct took place in public areas of the building.

The court also noted that the Plaintiffs had not shown that all of the subject documents are in the public record or are publicly available. The court ordered that the following videos and documents be designated as "Confidential" pursuant to the protective order entered on March 22, 2021: (1) the video with the bates number "AHF-TURNER 01367," (2) the video with the bates number "AHF-TURNER 01368," (3) the video with the bates number "AHF-TURNER 01394," and (4) the documents with the bates numbers "AHF-TURNER 1135-1396" and "AHF-TURNER 1567-1717."

The court also ordered that counsel for the Defendant and the Plaintiffs meet and confer, no later than November 15, 2024, to discuss and determine whether any of the documents within bates numbers "AHF-TURNER 1135-1396" and "AHF-TURNER 1567-1717" that were created by the Plaintiffs should not be designated as confidential.
