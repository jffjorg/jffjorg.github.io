BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs Julieann Berg
(“Berg”) and Terri James (“James”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this breach
of warranty of habitability action on April 8, 2024 against defendants Syliva
and Harry Naman Heritage Properties, LLC, Naman Family Investments, LP, Chad
Naman, as trustee of the Chad Naman 2021 Trust, Kimberly Naman, as trustee of
the Kimberly Naman 2021 Trust, and Amy Ruggles, as trustee of the Jennifer
Naman 2021 Trust.[1]  
Defendants Syliva and Harry
Naman Heritage Properties, LLC, Naman Family Investments, LP, Chad Naman, as
trustee of the Chad Naman 2021 Trust, Kimberly Naman, as trustee of the
Kimberly Naman 2021 Trust (“Defendants”) now move the court for an order     (1) sustaining
their demurrer to Plaintiff’s fifth, sixth, and 12th causes of action, and (2)
striking from Plaintiffs’ Complaint the requests for punitive damages and
supporting allegations. 
DEMURRER
The court overrules
Defendants’ demurrer to plaintiff James’s fifth cause of action for breach of
the covenant of quiet enjoyment because it states facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action since plaintiff James (1) is not required to
allege that she was actually or constructively evicted to maintain this cause
of action, and (2) has alleged that Defendants interfered with her right to
quiet enjoyment of the property (Compl., ¶ 107).  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e); Ginsberg
v. Gamson (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 873, 898 [“breach of the implied covenant
of quiet enjoyment can be understood as a title encompassing claims for
wrongful eviction, and also claims in which the tenant’s use of the
premises is disturbed, but the tenant remains in possession”] [emphasis added];
Erlach v. Sierra Asset Servicing, LLC (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1281, 1300
[“In recent years, the covenant of quiet enjoyment has been expanded, and in
this state, for example, it insulates the tenant against any act or omission on
the part of the landlord, or anyone claiming under him, which interferes with a
tenant’s right to use and enjoy the premises for the purposes contemplated by
the tenancy”] [internal quotation marks and citations omitted]; Nativi v.
Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 261,392 [“some authorities
recognize that a tenant may sue for breach of the covenant while remaining in
possession”].) 
The court overrules
Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiff’s sixth cause of action for nuisance because
(1) it states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action (Compl., ¶¶ 25,
29, 114), and (2) the court finds that it is not duplicative of the negligence
cause of action.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (e); Lynch v. Peter & Associates, Engineers, Geologists,
Surveyors, Inc. (2024) 104 Cal.App.5th 1181, 1198 [“Even if the nuisance
claim relies on the same facts about lack of due care supporting the negligence
claim, it does not mean the claims are identical or duplicative . . . .  Also, assessing a nuisance claim in this
manner ignores the fact that a duty between defendant and plaintiff need not
exist to maintain a nuisance claim”].) 
            The
court overrules Defendants’ demurrer to Plaintiffs’ 12th cause of action for
intentional infliction of emotional distress because it states facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action since Plaintiffs have alleged facts
establishing that (1) Defendants’ conduct, in failing to address the mold
growing in Plaintiffs’ units, causing Plaintiffs to suffer health and
respiratory issues (Compl., ¶¶ 45, 68, 70), despite their knowledge and
Plaintiffs’ complaints about the condition of their units (Compl., ¶¶ 38-40,
43, 44-48, 51, 55, 168), was “so extreme as to exceed all bounds of decency in
a civilized community[,]” and (2) Plaintiffs suffered severe emotional distress
(Compl., ¶ 173).  (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (e); Berry v. Frazier (2023) 90 Cal.App.5th 1258, 1273
[elements of intentional infliction of emotional distress].) 
MOTION TO STRIKE
Defendants move the court for an order striking (1) Plaintiffs’ requests
for punitive damages (Compl., ¶¶ 72, 74, 84, 103, 111, 118, 140, 174; Compl.,
Prayer, ¶ 5), and (2) the supporting allegations (Compl., ¶¶ 66, 73, and pp.
15:17-23 (erroneously labeled ¶ 53), 16:2-3 (erroneously labeled ¶ 55)).
The court grants Defendants’ motion to strike plaintiff James’s
request for punitive damages, as alleged in support of the fifth cause of
action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment only (Compl., ¶ 111),
because that cause of action, as alleged by plaintiff James, sounds in contract
and therefore cannot support a request for punitive damages.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436; Civ. Code, § 3294,
subd. (a); Ginsberg, supra, 205 Cal.App.4th at pp. 901 [“These
cases do not support the proposition that a tort claim arises out of the breach
of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, when there has been no eviction and the
tenant remains in possession of the premises”], 902 [“when the landlord has
breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, but the tenant remains in
possession of the premises, the tenant’s remedy is to ‘sue for breach of
contract damages’”]; Spinks v. Equity Residential Briarwood Apartments (2009)
171 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1030-1031 [characterizing breach of the implied covenant
of quiet enjoyment to be a cause of action “sounding in contract”].) 
The court denies Defendants’ motion to strike the remaining
allegations and requests for punitive damages because Plaintiffs have alleged
sufficient facts establishing that (1) Defendants were guilty of malice or
oppression based on the allegations that Defendants failed to remediate the
mold that was visible in Plaintiffs’ units throughout their tenancies,
including after Plaintiffs advised Defendants’ agent, Ora Maschiach, of the
adverse physical symptoms that they suffered as a result thereof (Compl., ¶¶ 38,
40, 42-45, 50), and (2) Defendants’ authorization, ratification, or act of
oppression and malice was on the part of an officer, director, or managing
agent of Defendants (Compl., pp. 15:16-16:10.) 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 436; Civ. Code, § 3294, subds. (a), (b); King v.
U.S. Bank National Association (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 675, 711 [discussing malice
and despicable conduct within the meaning of Civil Code section 3294].) 
The burden is on the plaintiff “to articulate how it could amend its
pleading to render it sufficient.”¿ (Palm Springs Villas II Homeowners
Assn., Inc. v. Parth (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 268, 290.)¿ To satisfy that
burden, a plaintiff “must show in what manner he can amend his complaint and
how that amendment will change the legal effect of his pleading.”¿ (Goodman
v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.)  The court finds that plaintiff
James has not met her burden to articulate how she can amend her request for
punitive damages, made in connection with the fifth cause of action for breach
of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, to render it sufficient against
Defendants.  The court therefore grants
Defendants’ motion to strike that request (Compl., ¶ 111) without leave to
amend.
