The court notes that the Cross-Complaint has erroneously labeled two separate
allegations as paragraph 38. 
(Cross-Compl., pp. 8:24-9:2.) 


[2] The
court notes that, even if Cross-Complainants had demonstrated that the
allegations made to those entities were false, Cross-Complainants did not
present authority or argument establishing that allegedly false allegations
made in a Complaint fall outside of the statute.  (Cross-Compl., ¶¶ 38 (second), 40.)

The court notes that this ruling does not find that the litigation privilege
does not apply, and instead finds only that Cross-Defendants have not met their
burden in establishing its applicability in connection with this motion.


[4]
The court notes that the defamation claim appears to be based solely on the
alleged communications made by Cross-Defendants regarding the Thunderbird.  (Cross-Compl., ¶¶ 18-20, 38 (second) – 40.)
