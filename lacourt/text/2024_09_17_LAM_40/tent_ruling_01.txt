 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees, Costs and Expenses 



 
I. Background
This is a lemon law action arising
from Plaintiff Maricruz Santiago (Santiago) purchasing a 2015 Subaru Forester,
which was manufactured and distributed by Defendant Subaru of America, Inc.
(Subaru). 
On January
26, 2024, Santiago accepted Subaru’s Code of Civil Procedure section 998 Offer
of Compromise (998 Offer) in the amount of $80,000 plus Santiago’s costs,
expenses and attorney fees. (Baker Decl., ¶ 91, Ex. 4.) 

On April 11, 2024, Santiago filed
the instant motion for attorney’s fees. 
On July 9, 2024, Subaru opposed the
motion. 
On July 15, 2024, Santiago replied.

 
II. Motion
A. Requests for Judicial Notice
Plaintiff requests that the Court
take judicial notice of a series of rulings on fee motions in other
Song-Beverly cases. 
The Court may take judicial notice
of records of any court of record of the United States. (Evid. Code §
452(d)(2).) The request for judicial notice is GRANTED to the extent of their
existence. However, the Court does not take judicial notice of the truth of the
matters within the documents. (See C.R. Tenet Healthcare Corp. (2009)
169 Cal.App.4th 1094, 110.) 
B. Evidentiary Objections
Plaintiff’s evidentiary objections
to the Declaration of Jacqueline Bruce Chinery are SUSTAINED as to Nos. 1, 2
and 3. 
C. Legal Standard
Attorneys’ fees are allowed as
costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc, § 1033.5, subd.
(a)(10)(B).)  In a lemon law action, costs and expenses, including
attorney’s fees, may be recovered by a prevailing buyer under the Song-Beverly
Act. (See Civ. Code, § 1794 subd. (d).) 
Section 1794 provides: “If the
buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by
the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate
amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time
expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer
in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.” (Civ.
Code, § 1794.) 
Thus, the statute includes a
“reasonable attorney’s fees” standard.  The attorney bears the burden of
proof as to “reasonableness” of any fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5 subd.
(c)(5).) This burden requires competent evidence as to the nature and value of
the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 553,
559.) “Testimony of an attorney as to the number of hours worked on a
particular case is sufficient evidence to support an award of attorney fees,
even in the absence of detailed time records.” (Ibid.) 
A plaintiff’s verified billing
invoices are prima facie evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed
were necessarily incurred. (See Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d
677, 682.) “In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of
work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the
specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.
General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do
not suffice.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459,
488, quoting Premier Med. Mgmt. Sys., Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee
Ass’n (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.) The Court has discretion to reduce
fees that result from inefficient or duplicative use of time. (Horsford v.
Bd. of Trustees of California State Univ. (2005) 132 Cal. App. 4th 359,
395.) 
In determining a reasonable
attorney fee, the trial court begins with the lodestar, i.e., the number of
hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate. (Warren
v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 24, 36.) The lodestar may
then be adjusted based on factors specific to the case in order to fix the fee
at the fair market value of the legal services provided. (Ibid.) These
facts include (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2) the
skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the
litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award. (Ibid.) 
D. Analysis 
Santiago moves for an award of
attorney fees, costs, and expenses in the amount of $189,690.57, consisting of:
(1) $127,619.00 in attorney fees for Strategic Legal Practices, APC (SLP); (2)
a 1.35 multiplier enhancement on the attorney fees ($44,666.65); (3) $13,904.92
in costs and expenses for SLP; and (4) an additional $3,500.00 for Santiago’s
counsel to review Subaru’s Opposition, draft the Reply, and attend the hearing
on this Motion. (Notice of Motion, p. i; Civ. Code §§ 1794 subd. (d), 998.) 
Subaru argues that the Santiago’s
counsel padded their fees, spent excessive amounts of time performing tasks and
billed excessive amounts for documents already drafted in other cases. (Opp. p.
11.) Subaru thus requests that Santiago’s attorney’s fees be denied in their
entirety, or in the alternative, be reduced to $14,659.00, or a lesser amount.
(Opp. p. 11.)
1.    
Prevailing Party 
Santiago
seeks an award of attorney’s fees pursuant to a settlement agreement reached by
the parties. On January 26, 2024, Santiago accepted Subaru’s 998 Offer
for $80,000.00 plus costs, expenses and attorney’s fees pursuant to Civ. Code section
1794 subd. (d). (Baker Decl. ¶ 91; Ex. 4.) 
It is
undisputed that Santiago is the prevailing party in this action and entitled to
a reasonable amount in attorney fees.
2.     Reasonableness
of Hourly Rates
“The reasonable hourly rate is
that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (PLCM Group v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “The experienced trial judge is the best judge
of the value of professional services rendered in [her] court.” (Ibid.)
Santiago seeks to recover attorney
fees for 19 attorneys and one law clerk (Canton) who worked on the case: 
(1) Mani Arabi at $495/hr, (2) Angel Baker at $595/hr, (3)
Neal Butala at $460/hr, (4) Christopher Campbell at
$495/hr, (5) Eve Canton at $295/hr, (6) Jason Clark at
$550/hr, (7) Tionna Carvalho at $570/hr in 2023 and then $595/hr in 2024, (8) Mark
Gibson at $475/hr, (9) Jared Kaye at $395/hr, (10) Regina Liou at $475/hr, (11)
David Lunn at $620/hr, (12) Ian McCallister at $595/hr, (13) Bryan Miller at
$595/hr, (14) David Rodriguez at $595/hr, (15) Ezra Ryu at $385/hr, (16) Nino
Sanaia at $425/hr, (17) Artin Sodaify at $410/hr, (18) Rosy Stoliker at $395/hr,
(19) Rabiya Trimizi at $375/hr in 2023 and then $395/hr, in 2024, and (20) Oliver Tomas at $610/hr. (Shahian Decl. ¶¶ 44-83, Ex. 18.)
Santiago’s counsel demonstrates that the attorney’s
rates are commonly accepted within their community of practice in the relevant
area of law. (Shahian Decl.  ¶¶ 44-83.) 
Subaru’s counsel argues that the billing rates are
unreasonable considering the non-complex nature of the case. (Opp. pp. 4-5.) In
line with Mikhaeilpoor v. BMW of North America, LLC (2020) 48
Cal.App.5th 240, Subaru argues that all rates should be reduced to $350/hr. (Opp.
p. 5.) 
Here, the attorney’s hourly rates varied from $375/hr to $610/hr. (Shahian
Decl. ¶¶ 44-83, Ex. 18.) These rates are reasonable within the Los Angeles community for work of this
nature. (Shahian
Decl. ¶¶ 44-83.)
3.     Reasonableness
of Hours Incurred
“A trial court assessing
attorney fees begins with a touchstone or lodestar figure, based on the
‘careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of
each attorney ... involved in the presentation of the case.” (Christian
Research Institute v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) “The
reasonableness of attorney fees is within the discretion of the trial court, to
be determined from a consideration of such factors as the nature of the
litigation, the complexity of the issues, the experience and expertise of
counsel and the amount of time involved. The court may also consider whether
the amount requested is based upon unnecessary or duplicative work.” (Wilkerson
v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443, 448.)
Santiago seeks to recover
attorney’s fees for 261.15 hours litigating this matter. (Mot. p. 10.) Santiago
has submitted billing records. (Shahian Decl., Ex. 18.)
            Subaru
objects to several of Santiago’s requested fees on the grounds that Santiago’s
counsel billed excessive hours for routine tasks and/or billed unnecessary
tasks (Opp. pp. 5-10.) 
            First,
Subaru objects to 2.3 hours ($1,092.50) billed on April 5, 2021, to draft Santiago’s
Complaint on the grounds that it is the standard complaint filed in every case.
(Opp. p. 5.)
            Second, Subaru
objects to 4.9 hours ($2,254.00) billed on July 20, 2021, to draft responses
and document production for written discovery on the grounds that the responses
are templated. (Opp. p. 5.)
Third, Subaru objects to 31.1
hours ($13,316.50) billed between August 15, 2022, August 16, 2022, August 19,
2022, January 10, 2023, and March 22, 2023, to litigate various motions to
compel discovery responses all of which the Court denied in their entirety as
moot. (Opp. p. 6.)
Fourth, Subaru objects to 8.4
hours ($4,470.00) billed between July 16, 2021, July 17, 2021, July 20, 2021,
September 1, 2021, November 13, 2023, December 5, 2023, December 7, 2023,
December 11, 2023, and January 26, 2024, to communicate with their client.
Subaru also objects to 11.2 hours ($10,494.00) block billed for tasks that also
included communicating with the client. Subaru objects to these entries on the
grounds that they are unnecessary and excessive. (Opp. p. 6.) 
Fifth, Subaru objects to 4.6
hours ($2,737.00) billed on July 12, 2023, to draft and finalize motions in
limine on the grounds that the motions are the templated. (Opp. p. 6.)
Sixth, Subaru objects to various
entries on the grounds that they are duplicative. Subaru objects to 6.2 hours ($3,689.00)
billed on July 24, 2023, 4.9 hours ($2,915.50) billed on November 29, 2023, 2.1
hours ($1,249.50) billed on November 30, 2023, and 2.8 hours ($1,666.00) and
2.4 hours ($1,188.00) billed on December 5, 2023, all to draft and finalize oppositions
to motions in limine. (Opp. pp. 6-7.) Subaru also objects to 3.5 hours
($1,662.50) billed on August 1 and 2, 2023, 1.2 hours ($744.00) billed on
August 2, 2023, and 11.4 hours ($4,674.00) billed November 20 and 21, 2023, all
to draft and revise joint trial documents. (Opp. p. 7.)
Seventh, Subaru objects to 3.9
hours ($2,320.50) billed on November 30, 2023, December 2 and 4, 2023 to
analyze trial documents and prepare for trial, and to 8.5 hours ($5,057.50)
billed on December 9, 2023 to prepare to argue motions in limine and
depositions by an attorney that had not worked on the matter during the
previous two years. (Opp. p. 7.) 
Eighth, Subaru objects to 5.3
hours ($2,517.50) billed between July 28, 2023, and July 31, 2023, to draft a
notice to appear at trial on the grounds that the notice is templated. (Opp.
p.7.)
Ninth, Subaru objects to 2.4
hours ($948.00) billed on August 6, 2023 and 1.1 hours ($654.50) billed on
November 30, 2023 to analyze discovery on the grounds that time is excessive. (Opp.
p. 8.)
Tenth, Subaru objects to
multiple entries on the grounds that they are block billed. (Opp. pp. 8-9.) 
Finally, Subaru objects to 7.5
hours ($4,462.50) in connection with the present motion and (Opp. p. 10.) 
The trial court has an obligation to award only those attorneys’ fees
that are reasonable.¿ See PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084,
1096 (PLCM Group); see also Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1132.  “When a ‘voluminous fee application’ is made, the court may …
‘make across-the-board percentage cuts either in the number of hours claimed or
in the final lodestar figure.’” (Kerkeles
v. City of San Jose (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 88, 102.)
Here, the number of hours spent on
this matter are excessive. Santiago seeks to recover 261.15 hours billed by 19
different attorneys. 19 attorneys certainly suggest overstaffing. This was a
non-complex lemon law case and Santiago’s lawyers are well versed in this field.
This is demonstrated by the dozens of similar lemon law cases Santiago references
involving Strategic Law Partners, many of which were handled by the same
attorneys from Strategic Law Partners who worked on this case. (See Shahian Decl. ¶¶ 44-83, Exs. 1-17.)
Not all of the time requested is reasonable for routine lemon law tasks.
(See, e.g. Shahian Decl. Ex. 18 [4.9
hours to draft discovery responses, 31.1. hours to draft moot motions to compel
discovery, 18.4 hours to draft oppositions to motions in limine, 5.3 hours to
draft a notice to appear at trial.] Santiago’s counsel also appears to have
overbilled for work on the instant motion (7.5 hours) and anticipated cost of
reviewing any opposition and drafting a reply ($3,500.00). (See Shahian Decl.
Ex 18) Moreover, block billing can exacerbate the vagueness of an
attorney’s fees request and support a court’s finding that time entries were
inflated and non-compensable Christian Research Institute v. Alnor
(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1325-1326.) 
Thus, Santiago’s billing should be reduced. Upon review and consideration
of Santiago’s submitted billing statements, the Court finds that a 35%
reduction is appropriate. Total attorney’s fees, up through and including
counsel’s work on the instant motion and time to reply and attend the hearing
thereon, shall thus be $85,227.35. ($127,619.00
+ $3,500 = $131,119.00; $131,119.00 x 35% = $45,891.65; $131,119.00 - $45,891.65
= $85,227.35) 
4.     Multiplier

While the lodestar reflects the
basic fee for comparable legal services in the community, it may be adjusted
based on various factors, including “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the
questions involved, and the skill displayed in presenting them; (2) the extent
to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys; (3) the contingent nature of the fee award” and (4) the success
achieved. (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.)
Santiago additionally requests a
lodestar multiplier enhancement of 1.35 based on counsel obtaining an excellent
outcome, the risks posed by the litigation, and the delay of payment. (Mot. pp.
13-14.) 
Here, a lodestar multiplier is
not appropriate. This is a straightforward lemon law case with no noted
complicating factors. Nothing before the Court indicates that the case precluded
other employment by Santiago’s counsel. Any contingency risk factor is already accounted
for in the hourly rates. 
Thus, the request for a lodestar
multiplier is denied. 
5.     Costs
Santiago requests a total of $13,904.92
in costs and expenses for Strategic Legal Partners. (Mot. p. i; Shahian Decl. Ex. 18.) Subaru does not
object to the costs. 
Thus, Santiago’s request for
$13,904.92 in costs is granted. 
III. Conclusion
Plaintiff’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees, Costs and Expenses is GRANTED in part.
The Court awards $85,227.35 in
attorney’s fees and $13,904.92 in costs and expenses to Strategic Legal
Partners for a total of $99,132.27 in costs and fees.
