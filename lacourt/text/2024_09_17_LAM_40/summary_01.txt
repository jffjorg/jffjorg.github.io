And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled on Santiago's motion for attorney's fees, costs, and expenses. Santiago is seeking an award of $185,690.57 in attorney's fees, costs, and expenses, but the Judge has reduced the award to $99,132.27.

The Judge has found that Santiago is the prevailing party in this case and is entitled to a reasonable amount in attorney fees. The Judge has also found that the billing rates submitted by Santiago's counsel are reasonable, but has reduced the amount of attorney's fees due to excessive billing.

The Judge has denied the request for a lodestar multiplier enhancement, finding that a lodestar multiplier is not appropriate in this case. The Judge has also denied the request for additional fees for review and reply, finding that the amount requested is excessive.

The Judge has granted Santiago's request for costs and expenses in the amount of $13,904.92. The Judge has also awarded attorney's fees in the amount of $85,227.35, which is the reduced amount after applying a 35% reduction.

The Judge's tentative ruling is subject to change based on any further input or objections received.
