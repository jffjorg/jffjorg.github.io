 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Defendant Brink’s Global Services, Inc. Demurrer to Plaintiff Stephen
  Newland’s Third Amended Complaint
Plaintiff’s Motion for an Order Imposing Issue or Terminating Sanctions
  and Monetary Sanctions
  against Defendant Brink’s Global Services, Inc.
 



 
I. Background
A. Pleadings
Plaintiff Stephen Newland (Newland) sues Defendants Tyler Gallagher, Leah
Donoso, Christian Howard, Regal Assets, LLC (Regal Assets), Doe 1 Brink’s
Incorporated (Brink’s) and Does 2-20 pursuant to a June 26, 2024 Third Amended
Complaint (TAC) alleging claims of: (1) Fraud (Intentional or Reckless
Misrepresentation), (2) Fraud (False Promises), (3) Fraud (Concealment), (4) Conversion,
(5) Breach of Fiduciary Duty, and (6) Breach of Contract (7) Breach of Contract
(Third Party Beneficiary) against all Defendants; and (8) Breach of Deposit [Bailment]
against Brink’s and Does 2-10.
The claims arise from allegations that between August 24 and 25, 2018,
Newland was enticed to and did purchase silver and gold coins from Regal
Assets—a suspended California LLC that operated as the alter ego of Defendants
Gallagher, Donoso, and Howard, alleged as co-conspirators, as well as agents of
Regal Assets. Through Defendant Donoso, Regal Assets represented that it would
secure Newland’s coins with Brink’s pursuant to a Precious Metals Storage
Agreement (the Agreement) through which Brink’s would store precious metals
purchased from Regal Assets. Newland alleges having purchased the coins based
on Howard’s representations as to the coins’ characteristics and based on the
alleged agreement with Brink’s. Newland paid $15,007.67 for the coins, which were
allegedly stored with Brink’s, but for which Regal Assets persistently failed
to turn over account verification reports, which Newland requested on various
occasions. Later, Newland requested that the coins be transferred to him from
Brink’s, making his requests directly to Brink’s and to Regal Assets’ agents
Donoso and Howard. In October 2022, Brink’s finally responded to Plaintiff
Newland, asserting that it had transferred the silver and gold coins to
“Defendants ‘several months ago.’” Plaintiff Newland states that he never
received the coins from Defendants Regal Assets, Gallagher, Donoso or Howard.

II. Demurrer
A.   
Meet and Confer
The Court notes that Defendant has
met the meet and confer requirement pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
430.41. (Lagas Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.)
B.   
Legal Standard
A demurrer for sufficiency tests
whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007)
147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747; see Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) This
device can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the
pleading under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “To survive a
[general] demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.” (C.A. v. William S. Hart Union High
School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872.) 
In testing the sufficiency of the
cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly
pleaded. (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962,
966-67.) A demurrer, however, “does not admit contentions, deductions or
conclusions of fact or law.” (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d
695, 713.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally
and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228, disapproved on other grounds, Jones v.
Lodge at Torrey Pines Partnership (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1158, 1162.) The face
of the complaint includes exhibits attached to the complaint. (Frantz v.
Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94.) If facts appearing in the exhibits
contradict those alleged, the facts in the exhibits take precedence. (Holland
v. Morse Diesel Intern., Inc. (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1447, superseded
by statute on other grounds as stated in White v. Cridlebaugh (2009) 178
Cal.App.4th 506, 521.)
C.   
Analysis
1.    
Seventh Cause of Action, Breach of Contract (Third
Party Beneficiary): SUSTAINED
“A contract is a voluntary and
lawful agreement, by competent parties, for a good consideration, to do or not
to do a specified thing.” (Robinson v. Magee (1858) 9 Cal. 81, 83.) “To
prevail on a cause of action for breach of contract, the plaintiff must prove
(1) the contract, (2) the plaintiff’s performance of the contract or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) the defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damage to the
plaintiff.” (Richman v. Hartley (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1182, 1186.)
Implicit in the element of damage is that the defendant’s breach caused the
plaintiff’s damage.” (Troyk v. Farmers Group, Inc. (2009) 171
Cal.App.4th 1305, 1352, italics omitted.)
In their demurrer, Brink’s argues that Newland’s breach of contract claim
fails because the SAC does not allege facts sufficient to show that Brink’s
breached the Agreement with Regal Assets or that Newland was a third-party
beneficiary to the Agreement. 
In opposition, Newland argues that Code of Civil Procedure section 2017.210
entitles him to obtain discovery of Brink’s insurance policy. He argues that
the insurance policy will be probative on whether Newland is a third-party
beneficiary under the Agreement. The opposition does not otherwise address how
Brink’s breached the Agreement. 
Here, Newland alleges that Brink’s permitted the removal of his coins from the
vault without requiring Regal Assets to adhere to all the terms of the Precious
Metals Storage Agreement. He alleges that his losses were caused by Brink’s
failure to abide by the terms of the
Agreement and failure to hold Regal Assets to its duties under the Agreement. Newland
alleges that he is a third-party beneficiary under the Agreement. However,
accepting all the factual assertions in the TAC, including the exhibits, as true,
Newland has failed to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action for
breach of contract. “Implicit in the element of damage is that the defendant’s
breach caused the plaintiff’s damage.” (Troyk v. Farmers Group, Inc.
(2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1352, italics omitted.) 
Newland points to specific sections of the Agreement that he alleges
Brink’s or Regal Assets did not adhere to. (TAC pp. 20-23, Ex. D) Upon review
of the unredacted sections, and accepting the assertions as true, the alleged
breaches did not cause Newland’s loss. The sections of the Agreement that
Newland references are not related to Brink’s obligations when releasing the
coins from its vault. The sections reference various responsibilities Brink’s
had while the coins were in Brink's possession. However, the TAC does not
allege that Newland’s damages occurred while the coins were in Brink’s
possession. Allegations that Brink’s breached the Agreement regarding its
obligations while the coins were in its possession are immaterial to a loss
that occurred after the coins were no longer in Brink’s possession. 
Additionally, because the allegations do not support a cause of action
for breach of contract, the Court need not address the question of whether
Newland is a third-party beneficiary to the contract.  
Accordingly, Brink’s demurrer is SUSTAINED. 
2.    
Eighth Cause of Action, Breach of Deposit [Bailment]:
SUSTAINED 
A bailment is called a deposit
within the Civil Code. It is defined as “[a] voluntary deposit […] made by one
giving to another, with his consent, the possession of personal property to
keep for the benefit of the former, or of a third party.” (Civ. Code, § 1814.) Under
California law, “a bailment for the benefit of both parties … is a bailment for
hire, and imposes on the bailee the duty to use ordinary care with respect to
the bailed property.” (Gerbert v. Yank (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 544, 551.) “A
bailment ‘is made by one giving to another, with his consent, the possession of
personal property to keep for the benefit of the former, or of a third party.’”
(McKell v. Washington (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, 1491, citing Civ.
Code, § 1814; see Gebert v. Yank, supra, at p. 551; see, e.g., McKell
v. Washington, supra, at p. 1491 [“Plaintiffs allege[d] … [a] breach
of bailment cause of action [when they alleged] that they ‘delivered to
Washington Mutual, and Washington Mutual agreed to hold for the benefit of
plaintiffs, money to pay the cost of underwriting, tax services and wire
transfer services,” which Washington Mutual breached when it “paid only a
portion of the money to the third party vendors and kept a portion for itself”].)
The TAC alleges that Brink’s
breached its duties as a bailee by “permitting Defendants or unknown third
parties to remove Newland’s coins from Brink’s SLC Vault.” (TAC ¶ 127.) However,
the allegations in the TAC and the terms of the Agreement attached to the TAC
do not show how Brink’s release of the coins to Regal Assets was improper. Regal
Assets is named as the “Customer” in the Agreement. (TAC, Ex. D., Preamble) The
Customer is permitted to withdraw metals from the account with Brink’s. (TAC,
Ex. D., § 3 [setting out the process by which the Customer may withdraw metals
from the account with Brink’s].) Nowhere in the contractual terms does the Agreement
impose an obligation on Brink’s to consult with third parties who have an
interest in the stored metals prior to allowing Regal Assets to withdraw those
metals pursuant to section 3 of the Agreement. The Agreement only provides that
the metals would be released to the Customer—Regal Assets—upon following the
proper procedure, and here, the TAC alleges that Brink’s released the coins to
Regal Assets. (TAC, ¶ 117.) Thus, the
TAC fails to allege facts sufficient to show that Brink’s failed to act within
the appropriate standard of care for a bailee. 
Accordingly, Brink’s demurrer is SUSTAINED. 
 
III. Motion for
an Order Imposing Issue or Terminating Sanctions and Monetary Sanctions: DENIED
A.    Requests for Judicial Notice
The Court declines Plaintiff’s
request to take judicial notice of the excerpts from Brink’s Company’s 10-K
Forms because they are not relevant to the discovery abuses alleged in this
motion. (Evid. Code § 450.) (Lockley v. Law Office of Cantrell, Green,
Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 882 [“Judicial
notice is the recognition and acceptance by the court, for use by the trier of
fact or by the court, of the existence of a matter of law or fact that is
relevant to an issue in the action without requiring formal proof of the
matter.”].)  
B.    Evidentiary Objections
1.    
Defendant Brink’s
Objections to Plaintiff Newland’s Declaration
Not ruled on as not material to
the disposition of this motion.
2.    
Defendant Brink’s
Objections to Plaintiff Newland’s Proposed Findings of Fact
Not ruled on as not material to
the disposition of this motion.
C.    Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 permits California
courts to impose issue or evidence sanctions for discovery misuses, which are
defined by section 2023.010 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (See Peat,
Marwick, Mitchell & Co. v. Superior Court (1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 272,
288 [The court’s inherent power to curb abuses and promote fair process extends
to the preclusion of evidence].) 
Terminating sanctions are drastic sanctions that should be
imposed sparingly and only when it is clear that the party to be sanctioned has
left no viable alternatives. (See Dept. of Forestry & Fire. Prot. v.
Howell (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 154, 191, disapproved on other grounds in Presbyterian
Camp & Conf. Ctrs, Inc. v. Superior Court (2021) 12 Cal.5th 493; Lopez
v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc’y (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604.) The court should consider the
totality of the circumstances before ordering terminating sanctions, including
(1) whether the conduct of the party was willful, (2) the detriment to the
party propounding discovery, and (3) the number of formal and informal attempt
to obtain the discovery. (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 377, 390.) 
D.    Analysis
Newland moves for an order imposing issue sanctions, or in
the alternative, terminating sanctions and for an order awarding monetary
sanctions in the amount of $12,757.50 against Brink’s and Christensen Hsu &
Sipes, LLP, based on discovery abuses related to the Court’s May 13, 2024 order
regarding Category Nos. 9 and 11 in Newland’s Request for Production, Set One
(RFP). 
On June 12, 2024, Brink’s submitted First Amended Responses
to the RFP’s. (Mot. Ex. G.) On August 9, 2024, Brink’s submitted Second Amended
Responses to the RFP’s. (Opp. Ex. 3.) Upon review, the amended responses comply
with the May 13, 2024 Court Order. (See, Mot. Ex. G, Opp. Ex. 3 and Minute
Order, May 13, 2024.) 
            In the motion, Newland again argues
that the insurance documents he seeks are relevant to showing that Newland is a
third-party beneficiary under the Precious Metals Storage Agreement. As
discussed above, because Newland has failed to state a breach of contract cause
of action against Brink’s, whether Newland is a beneficiary to the contract is
irrelevant. Thus, there has been no misuse of the discovery process warranting
issue, termination or monetary sanctions.
            Accordingly, Newland’s motion for
sanctions is DENIED.
IV. Conclusion
The Defendant Brink’s Global Services, Inc.’s Demurrer to Plaintiff
Stephen Newland’s Third Amended Complaint is SUSTAINED, without leave to
amend. 
The Plaintiff Stephen Newland’s
Motion for an Order Imposing Issue or
Terminating Sanctions and Monetary Sanctions against Defendant Brink’s Global
Services, Inc. is DENIED.
