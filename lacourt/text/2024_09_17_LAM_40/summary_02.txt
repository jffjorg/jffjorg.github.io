Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and sanctions motions in this case. The defendant, Brink's Global Services, Inc., demurred to the seventh and eighth causes of action in the plaintiff's complaint, alleging that the plaintiff failed to state a cause of action for breach of contract and breach of deposit. The plaintiff, Stephen Newland, moved for sanctions, alleging that the defendant had engaged in discovery abuses.

The judge sustained the demurrer to the seventh cause of action, breach of contract, finding that the complaint did not allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action. The judge also sustained the demurrer to the eighth cause of action, breach of deposit, finding that the complaint did not allege facts sufficient to show that Brink's Global Services, Inc. failed to act within the appropriate standard of care for a bailee.

The judge denied the plaintiff's motion for sanctions, finding that the plaintiff had failed to state a breach of contract cause of action against Brink's Global Services, Inc. and that the defendant had complied with the court's order regarding discovery requests.
