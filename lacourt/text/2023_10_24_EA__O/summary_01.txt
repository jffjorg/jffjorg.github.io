And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling continues the demurrer filed by Defendant Ford Motor Company pending the California Supreme Court's decision in Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC. This is a lemon law case where Plaintiffs Pedro Soria and Andres Soria allege that Ford sold them a used vehicle that was not represented as a "lemon" vehicle, despite multiple service inquiries to repair defects. The vehicle experienced engine issues on the day of purchase, and Ford failed to cure the defects. The Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit alleging various claims, including failure to replace or make restitution, breach of express warranties, and violation of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, among others. The Defendant filed a demurrer, which was previously continued due to untimeliness, but was allowed to be considered on its merits after a waiver was filed. The Judge continues the hearing pending the California Supreme Court's decision on the applicability of the California lemon law to used vehicles.
