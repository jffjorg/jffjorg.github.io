  Case Number:  22PSCV01006    Hearing Date:   October 24, 2023    Dept:  O Tentative Ruling
 
DEFENDANT FORD MOTOR COMPANY’S DEMURRER TO PLAINTIFFS’
COMPLAINT is CONTINUED (again) pending the CA Supreme Court’s
decision in Rodriguez. 
 
Background
 
This is a
lemon law case. Plaintiffs PEDRO SORIA and ANDRES SORIA (collectively,
“Plaintiffs”) allege the following against Defendant Ford Motor Company
(“Defendant”): Plaintiffs purchased a used 2014 Ford Fusion (“Vehicle”) that
was not represented as a “lemon” vehicle “when in fact Ford had engaged in
multiple service inquires to repair the vehicle.”[1]
However, that same day as purchase, the Vehicle experienced engine issues and
Defendant failed to cure the defect(s). 
 
On September
7, 2022, Plaintiffs filed suit for: 1.     Failure to Replace or Make Restitution 2.     Breach of Express Warranties 3.     Failure to Begin Repairs Within
Reasonable Time and Complete Repairs Within 30 Days 4.     Breach of Implied Warranty 5.     Violation of the Consumer Legal
Remedies Action 6.     Negligent Misrepresentation 7.     Fraudulent Misrepresentation 8.     Concealment
 
On February
14, 2023, Defendant filed their first demurrer, which the court’s tentative was
to overrule due to untimeliness. 
 
On March 29,
2023, the court allowed the parties to file a stipulation to waive the
untimeliness of the demurrer and consider the pleading on its merits. The
hearing on the demurrer was continued. 
 
On June 2,
2023, the court continued the hearing on the instant demurrer. 
 
Discussion
 
Previously,
the court continued the demurrer because a large basis of Defendant’s demurrer
is that the SBA does not apply to used vehicles citing to Rodriguez v. FCA
US, LLC, (2022) 77 Cal.App.5th 209, 223. As the California Supreme Court
has granted the petition for review, the court again continues the hearing
pending the California Supreme Court’s decision. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the demurrer
is continued.
