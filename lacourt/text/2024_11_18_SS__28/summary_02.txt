And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the documents submitted in support of the plaintiff's request for default judgment and has denied the request without prejudice. The plaintiff is seeking a default judgment against the defendant for $47,873.01, consisting of $47,354.01 as the demand in the complaint and $519.00 in costs. However, the court has found that the plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence to support its assertion that it was required to pay its insured $38,693.00 in uninsured motorist bodily injury benefits. Additionally, there is an inconsistency in the injuries suffered by the plaintiff's insured, with the insured's declaration stating that they suffered a broken foot and/or cervical/thoracic sprain/strain. The court has ordered the plaintiff to address this inconsistency and has denied the application for default judgment.
