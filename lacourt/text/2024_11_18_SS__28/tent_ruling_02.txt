 Case Number:  22STCV35181    Hearing Date:   November 18, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the documents submitted in support of the request for default
judgment, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On November
3, 2022, Plaintiff United Financial Casualty Company (“Plaintiff”) filed this
action against Defendants Thomas Irwin (“Defendant”) and Does 1-20 for motor
vehicle tort and subrogation.  The complaint
demanded $47,354.01.  Plaintiff also filed
a statement of damages listing property damage of $8,661.01, uninsured motorist
bodily injury payments of $38,693.00, and total damages of $47,354.01.  On September 13, 2024, Plaintiff filed
another statement of damages listing the same damage amounts. 
On
June 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed a proof of service showing substituted service
of the summons, complaint, statement of damages, and other documents on
Defendant on June 3, 2023. 
On
April 17, 2024, the clerk entered Defendant’s default. 
On September
13, 2024, Plaintiff filed an application for Court judgment. 
On
September 16, 2024, the Court dismissed the Doe defendants without prejudice at
Plaintiff’s request. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff
asks the Court to enter a default judgment against Defendant and award
Plaintiff $47,873.01, consisting of $47,354.01 as the demand of the complaint
and $519.00 in costs. 

LEGAL STANDARD 
A.      Default judgment 
          California Rules of Court, rule
3.1800(a), provides: 
“[With exceptions that do not apply here,] [a] party
seeking a default judgment on declarations must use mandatory Request for Entry
of Default (Application to Enter Default) (form CIV-100) . . . The following
must be included in the documents filed with the clerk: 
“(1)  Except in
unlawful detainer cases, a brief summary of the case identifying the parties
and the nature of plaintiff's claim; 
“(2) 
Declarations or other admissible evidence in support of the judgment
requested; 
“(3)  Interest
computations as necessary; 
“(4)  A
memorandum of costs and disbursements; 
“(5)  A
declaration of nonmilitary status for each defendant against whom judgment is
sought; 
“(6)  A proposed
form of judgment; 
“(7)  A dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not
sought or an application for separate judgment against specified parties under
Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each
judgment; 
“(8)  Exhibits
as necessary; and 
“(9)  A request
for attorney fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties.” 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800(a).) 
B.       Damages 
 The relief granted to a plaintiff upon entry
of a defendant's default cannot exceed the amount demanded in the complaint or,
for personal injury cases where damages may not be stated in the complaint, the
amount listed in the statement of damages. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, subd. (a),
585, subd. (b).) “The notice requirement of section 580 was designed to insure
fundamental fairness.” (Becker v. S.P.V. Construction Co. (1980) 27
Cal.3d 489, 494.) The statute insures that “defendants in cases which involve a
default judgment have adequate notice of the judgments that may be taken
against them. [Citation.] ‘If a judgment other than that which is demanded is
taken against him, [the defendant] has been deprived of his day in court—a
right to a hearing on the matter adjudicated.’ ’’ (Id. at p. 493.) A
trial court exceeds its jurisdiction if it awards damages in excess of the
amount specified in the complaint or statement of damages. (Id. at p.
494.) 
DISCUSSION 
          Plaintiff’s insured has submitted a declaration stating
that she suffered a broken foot in the accident. 
However, Plaintiff’s custodian of records has submitted a declaration
stating that Plaintiff’s insured suffered “cervical/thoracic sprain/strain.”   Plaintiff should address this inconsistency. 
          Plaintiff has not provided evidence (such as copies of
medical records or billing) supporting Plaintiff’s assertion that it was
required to pay its insured $38,693.00 in uninsured motorist bodily injury
benefits. 
          For these reasons, the Court denies Plaintiff’s application for default judgment. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice Plaintiff United Financial Casualty Company’s
application for default judgment against Defendant Thomas Irwin filed on
September 13, 2024. 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
