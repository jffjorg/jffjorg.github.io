And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge on a case between plaintiff Charles Bryan and the People of the State of California, acting by and through the Department of Transportation. The plaintiff alleges that he was injured due to an unsafe condition on Interstate 10 westbound, caused by poorly marked curb and inadequate barricades, and seeks damages from the defendant. The defendant demurred to the complaint, arguing that it is not liable for the plaintiff's injuries because it is immune from liability under various statutes. The court agrees with the defendant and sustains its demurrer with 30 days leave to amend. The court also denies the defendant's motion to strike as moot. The plaintiff is allowed to amend the complaint, but only as authorized by the court's order and may not add new parties or causes of action without permission. The court requires the plaintiff to provide specific facts to support its claim that the defendant is liable despite the immunities provided by statute.
