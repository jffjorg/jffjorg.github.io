And here is a summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling on two motions to compel further responses in a breach of contract action. The court grants the motions in part, but denies them in part. The defendant had provided objection-only responses to the plaintiff's discovery requests, and the court finds that these objections were not well-taken. The court also grants sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $3060.

The court provides guidelines for discovery responses and meet and confer processes, emphasizing the importance of good faith efforts to resolve disputes. The court also notes that boilerplate objections are viewed as being in bad faith and that a good faith response is required before the meet and confer process begins.

The court orders the parties to engage in a meet and confer process, which should be approached as a problem-solving exercise. The court also emphasizes the importance of civil, polite, and professional communication during the meet and confer process.
