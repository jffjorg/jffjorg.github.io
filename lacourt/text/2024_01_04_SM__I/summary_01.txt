And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the ex parte motion and will allow the deposition to proceed on January 23, 2024, and continue from day to day until completed. The defendant is allowed to raise objections to the deposition topics and production, but the judge warns that if the objections are made in bad faith, the court may infer that the evidence would defeat the summary judgment motion. The judge is also aware of the defendant's strong showing of a lack of diligence by the plaintiff, who has waited until the last moment to request a continuance. Despite this, the court has decided to give the plaintiff a chance to gather evidence to potentially defeat the summary judgment motion. The MSJ hearing will be continued for approximately five weeks to allow for this additional discovery. The judge reminds defense counsel that speaking objections are not permitted and that instructions not to answer should be limited to situations where a privilege would otherwise be waived. The court hopes for a clean deposition and will review the evidence gathered to make a decision on the summary judgment motion.
