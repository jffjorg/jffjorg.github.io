Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed a motion to compel and a motion for a protective order related to a deposition of Benico, a person who worked for the plaintiff. The defendant, Mercury, seeks to depose Benico and produce documents, while the plaintiff seeks to limit the deposition to prevent duplicative questioning. The court has found that the related case order between this case and another case involving the same underlying claim has an impact on the discovery process. The court disagrees with Mercury's argument that the related case order has no substance and agrees with the plaintiff that the purpose of relating cases is to enhance judicial efficiency. The court has decided that the deposition may go forward, but it should be limited in length to 4 hours and should not be redundant of questions asked at the prior deposition. The court has also advised the parties to work out their differences cooperatively and has denied requests for sanctions.
