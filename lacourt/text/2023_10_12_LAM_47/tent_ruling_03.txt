STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants conspired
to induce Plaintiff Yoav Botach to sell the Garfield Building at 403 W. 8th

property to Kyriakos Kerry Bonnis for well below its listed price. Plaintiffs
allege causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, declaratory
relief, financial elder abuse, and negligence.
 
            The
parties filed cross-motions to tax memorandum of costs. 
 
//

Defendants’ Motion to Tax Costs is
GRANTED IN PART. Plaintiff’s claimed costs for $242.00 under Item 12 in
transcripts not ordered by the court, $2,193.55 under Item 16 related to
photocopying of documents, and $119.18 under Item 16 related to postage are
hereby stricken The Court taxes a total of $2,554.73 in requested costs, thus
authorizing a cost award to Plaintiff of $38,588.02. 
 
Plaintiff the Estate of Yoav
Botach’s Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED IN PART. Defendants’ claim for expert
fees under Item 8b is taxed in the amount of $82,055.68, thus permitting a cost
award to Defendants of $219,570.06.
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Motion to Tax Costs Claimed by Plaintiff YB Real Estate
Properties I, LLC
 
            Defendants
move to tax various specified costs claimed by Plaintiff YB Real Estate
Properties I, LLC (“YBREP”) in its memorandum of costs filed July 31, 2023.
 
Legal Standard 
 
In general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter
of right to recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (Code Civ.
Proc. §1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott Co.
Of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.)  Assuming the
“prevailing party” requirements are met, the trial court has no discretion to
order each party to bear his or her own costs of suit.  (Michell v.
Olick (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1198; Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 111, 129.) A defendant who is dismissed from the action is the
“prevailing party.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §1032(a)(4).) This is so whether the
dismissal is voluntary or involuntary.  (Santisas, 17 Cal.4th at 606.)  
 
Allowable costs under Section 1033.5 must be reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation, rather than merely convenient or
beneficial to its preparation, and must be reasonable in amount.  An item
not specifically allowable under Section 1033.5(a) nor prohibited under
subdivision (b) may nevertheless be recoverable in the discretion of the court
if it meets the above requirements (i.e., reasonably necessary and
reasonable in amount).  If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be
proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that
they were not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v. California State Automotive
Assoc. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-774.)  On the other hand, if the
items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof
is on the party claiming them as costs.  (Ibid.) Whether a cost
item was reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for
the trial court and its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  (Ibid.) 
Because the right to costs is governed strictly by statute, however, a court
has no discretion to award costs not statutorily authorized.  (Id.) 
Discretion is abused only when, in its exercise, the court “exceeds the bounds
of reason, all of the circumstances being considered.”  (Ibid.)   
 
//
 
Timeliness of Motion
 
“Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be
served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost
memorandum was served by mail or email, the period is extended as provided in
Code of Civil Procedure section 1013.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(b)(1).) Here,
Plaintiff served the memorandum of costs by electronic service on July 31, 2023.
(Memorandum of Costs POS.) Fifteen days plus two court days places the deadline
for this motion on August 17, 2023. This motion was filed on August 15, 2023,
exactly fifteen days after the date this motion was served and filed.  The motion is therefore timely. 
 
Specificity of
Challenged Costs
 
            Defendants specifically identify in
the Notice of Motion which costs they seek to challenge, pursuant to California
Rule of Court 3.1700(b).  The Court notes,
however, that Defendants also ask that “any remaining costs claimed by YBREP in
its verified Memorandum of Costs be apportioned between the prevailing and
non-prevailing co-plaintiffs and any cost award to YBREP be further reduced
accordingly.” (Notice of Motion p. 2:13-15.) Defendants do not specify in the
Notice of Motion which of the remaining costs they contend should be so
apportioned. This objection is thus not in compliance with Rule 3.1700(b). The
Court therefore refuses to address this challenge to the memorandum of costs. 
 
Disputed Cost Items
 
            Defendants
identify five cost items in Plaintiff’s memorandum of costs to which they
object: (1) Court Reporter Fees in Item 12, and Attachment 12c; (2) Private
Mediation costs in Item 16; (3) costs for Copies in Item 16; (4) costs for
FedEx Delivery in Item 16; and (5) costs for mileage, transportation, and
parking in Item 16.
 
1.     
Court Reporter Fees
 
            Defendants’
first challenge is to Item 12, and Attachment 12c, which identifies Court
Reporter Fees in the amount of $1,947. (Memorandum of Costs Item 12.) Attachment
12c apportions these fees as $1,306.25 incurred for Phyllis Young-Lee on
December 16, 2022, $398.75 for Adra L. Pittman for a Final Status Conference on
December 20, 2022 (misstated as December 20, 2023), and $242.00 for Kimberly M.
Lowe for trial on February 2, 2023. (Attach. 12c.) Defendants contend that the
request for court reporter fees for December 16 is improper because it does not
specify for what hearing those fees were incurred, and that both the December
16 and December 20 fees are improperly sought because they are not charges for
the official court reporter at trial, which are expressly recoverable by
statute. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(11); Gov. Code § 68086(c).) Further,
Defendant contends that Plaintiff is improperly seeking to recover fees for Ms.
Lowe on February 2, 2023, that were not actually incurred, because the fees
were paid entirely by Defendants. (Declaration of Thomas J. Kearney ISO Mot. ¶
4.) Defendant claims that the parties originally agreed to split court reporter
fees equally for the trial, but Plaintiff subsequently reneged on that
agreement, forcing Defendant to cover the full amount of trial reporter fees. (Id.)

 
Defendants’ objection to the fees
claimed for the December 20, 2022 Final Status conference is improper. The mere
fact that Plaintiff has sought court reporter fees that are not expressly authorized
by statute does not render this cost item improper, as such costs may be sought
subject to the Court’s discretion unless expressly excluded. (See Code Civ.
Proc. § 1033.5(c)(4).) However, Defendants have properly objected to the
remainder of the fees by demonstrating an apparent facial defect in the fees
sought for Ms. Lee’s services, and by producing evidence demonstrating that Ms.
Lowe’s fees were paid by Defendants, not Plaintiff. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff entirely
fails to address the fees claimed for December 16, 2022, and thus has not
demonstrated that it is entitled to recover these costs. With respect to the
February 2, 2023 fees, Plaintiff’s chief counsel, Brian Lysaght, claims that no
agreement to share court reporter fees was ever made. (Lysaght Decl. ¶ 5.)  Plaintiff has provided an invoice which states
that it was billed $242.00 for Ms. Lowe’s services on February 2, 2023. (Declaration
of Bryan Lysaght ISO Opp. ¶ Exh. 3. p.2.) It bears mentioning, however, that
the invoice shows only that Plaintiff was billed $242.00 for a 121-page rough
draft of the transcript, or $2.00 per page. (Id.) Put differently, this request
is not for court reporter fees, as claimed by Defendants, but rather for
transcript costs not ordered by the Court. This cost item is therefore
expressly improper under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5(b)(5) and must
be taxed. 
 
2.     
Private Mediation Costs
 
Defendants next challenge
Plaintiff’s request for $6,950 for JAMS Mediation on November 16, 2023. (Memorandum
Attach. 16a.) Defendants assert without citation to any authority that this
request is improper because it is not expressly authorized by statute. As
stated above, the mere fact that a cost item is not expressly permitted does
not make it improper. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(c)(4).) Defendants also assert
without any supporting evidence that the parties agreed to split mediation
costs, therefore rendering this request improper. An unsupported assertion is
not sufficient to properly place a cost item at issue. Defendants have thus
failed to demonstrate that this cost item is improper. 
 
3.     
Copies and Postage
 
Defendants also challenge
Plaintiff’s request for $2,193.55 in copies of documents and $119.18 in postage
as an improper request for copies and postage for materials other than trial
exhibits in Item 16. (Attach. 16a.) Costs for photocopying of exhibits are
expressly authorized by statute. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(a)(13).) However,
costs for postage or photocopying of documents other than exhibits are
expressly excluded. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(b)(3).) Defendants contend that
since Plaintiff separately claimed costs for preparation of trial exhibits
under Item 11, these cost items are improper. Many of the cost items for both
copies and postage identify court records and deposition transcripts, while
others involve medical records for Plaintiff. However, none of these items
demonstrate on their face that they pertain to trial exhibits. Defendants have
thus properly placed these cost items at issue. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff claims
that these cost items were incurred in connection with documents that were
filed in this case, were subpoenaed for use at trial, or were actually
introduced at trial. The mere fact that a document was filed in this case has
no bearing on whether printing or postage costs incurred in connection with
that document are costs for an exhibit. Further, Plaintiff offers no evidence whatsoever
demonstrating that any of the documents specified in these cost items were trial
exhibits, whether or not they were used or introduced into evidence. Plaintiff
has, thus, failed to demonstrate that these cost items are proper. 
 
4.     
Parking
 
Defendants’ final objection is to
Plaintiff’s request for mileage, transportation, and parking costs in the
amount of $2,157.26 in Item 16. (Attach. 16a.) Defendants claim that because
these costs are not for travel expenses to attend deposition, as expressly
authorized under section 1033.5(a)(3)(C), they should be excluded. As
repeatedly stated, the mere fact that cost items are not expressly authorized
does not inherently make those items improper. Defendants have therefore failed
to raise a proper objection to these costs. 
 
Conclusion
 
            Accordingly,
Defendants’ Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED IN PART. Plaintiff’s claimed costs
for $242.00 under Item 12 in transcripts not ordered by the court, $2,193.55
under Item 16 related to photocopying of documents, and $119.18 under Item 16 related
to postage are hereby stricken.  The
Court taxes a total of $2,554.73 in requested costs, thus authorizing a cost
award to Plaintiff of $38,588.02
 
Motion to Tax Costs Claimed by Newmark of Southern
California Inc., Newmark & Company Real Estate, Inc., and Gibran Begum

 
            Plaintiff
the Estate of Yoav Botach (hereafter “Plaintiff Botach”) moves to tax specific
costs sought in Defendants’ memorandum of costs filed August 1, 2023.
 
Legal Standard 
 
In general, the “prevailing party” is entitled as a matter
of right to recover costs for suit in any action or proceeding. (Code Civ.
Proc. §1032(b); Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 606; Scott Co.
Of Calif. v. Blount, Inc. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1103, 1108.)  Assuming the
“prevailing party” requirements are met, the trial court has no discretion to
order each party to bear his or her own costs of suit.  (Michell v.
Olick (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1194, 1198; Nelson v. Anderson (1999) 72
Cal.App.4th 111, 129.) A defendant who is dismissed from the action is the
“prevailing party.”  (Code Civ. Proc. §1032(a)(4).) This is so whether the
dismissal is voluntary or involuntary.  (Santisas, 17 Cal.4th at 606.)  
 
Allowable costs under Section 1033.5 must be reasonably
necessary to the conduct of the litigation, rather than merely convenient or
beneficial to its preparation, and must be reasonable in amount.  An item
not specifically allowable under Section 1033.5(a) nor prohibited under
subdivision (b) may nevertheless be recoverable in the discretion of the court
if they meet the above requirements (i.e., reasonably necessary and reasonable
in amount).  If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper
charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were
not reasonable or necessary. (Ladas v. California State Automotive Assoc.
(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 773-774.)  On the other hand, if the items are
properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the
party claiming them as costs.  (Ibid.) Whether a cost item was
reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the
trial court and its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  (Ibid.) 
However, because the right to costs is governed strictly by statute, a court
has no discretion to award costs not statutorily authorized.  (Id.) 
Discretion is abused only when, in its exercise, the court “exceeds the bounds
of reason, all of the circumstances being considered.”  (Ibid.)   
 
Timeliness of Motion
 
“Any notice of motion to strike or to tax costs must be
served and filed 15 days after service of the cost memorandum. If the cost
memorandum was served by mail or email, the period is extended as provided in
Code of Civil Procedure section 1013.”  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1700(b)(1).) Here,
Defendants served the memorandum of costs by electronic service on August 1,
2023. (Memorandum of Costs POS.) Fifteen days plus two court days places the
deadline for this motion on August 18, 2023, the date this motion was served
and filed.  The motion is therefore
timely. 
 
Specificity of Costs
 
            Plaintiff Botach specifically
identifies in the Notice of Motion which costs are challenged, pursuant to
California Rule of Court 3.1700(b). 
 
Disputed Costs
 
            Plaintiff
challenges three cost items in Defendants’ Memorandum of Costs: (1) a claim for
$3,251.56 for service on Shlomo Botach in Item 5; (2) a claim for $168,437.45
in expert fees in Item 8b; and (3) a claim for $89,039.50 for court reporter
and transcript fees in Item 12c. 
 
1.     
Service of Process
 
Plaintiff first challenges Item 5,
which seeks $4,963.36 in costs for service of process. (Memorandum Item 5.)
Plaintiff claims that the request for $3,251.56 in costs for service of Shlomo
Botach, as specified in the Memorandum, is improper because it is both
unreasonable in amount and not reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation. Plaintiff contends that because Shlomo Botach was not deposed, did
not testify at trial, and was not shown to have personal knowledge of any
matter presented to the jury, that service was not reasonably necessary to the
litigation. Plaintiff has made a prima facie showing that these exorbitant
service fees were not “reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation.”  (CCP § 1033.5(c)(2).)  In opposition, Defendants argue that Shlomo
Botach was Yoav’s brother and a co-owner of legal title of the Garfield
Building at the time the Purchase and Sale Agreement at issue in this case was
executed.  These facts – which were
evident at trial – support Defendants’ position that service of Shlomo Botach
as a potential witness in this case was “reasonably necessary” and, thus, the
costs of that service are recoverable. 
The mere fact that a witness is not deposed and does not testify at
trial does not render this cost item improper. (Doe v. Los Angeles County
Dept. of Children & Family Services (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 675, 694.) The
Court finds, therefore, that Plaintiff has not demonstrated that this cost item
should not be recoverable. 
 
//
2.     
Expert Fees
 
Plaintiff also challenges the
entirety of Item 8b, which seeks expert fees in the amount of $168,437.45, on
the basis that these fees are not reasonably necessary to the conduct of the
litigation, not reasonable in amount, and pertain to expert witnesses not
ordered by the Court and not authorized by statute. 
 
The thrust of Plaintiff’s challenge
is that Defendants are improperly seeking expert witness fees pursuant to Code
of Civil Procedure section 998 without a valid offer under that section. Section
998(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure states, in relevant part:
 
(b) Not less than 10 days prior to
commencement of trial or arbitration (as provided in Section 1281 or 1295) of a
dispute to be resolved by arbitration, any party may serve an offer in writing
upon any other party to the action to allow judgment to be taken or an award to
be entered in accordance with the terms and conditions stated at that time. The
written offer shall include a statement of the offer, containing the terms and
conditions of the judgment or award, and a provision that allows the accepting party
to indicate acceptance of the offer by signing a statement that the offer is
accepted. Any acceptance of the offer, whether made on the document containing
the offer or on a separate document of acceptance, shall be in writing and
shall be signed by counsel for the accepting party or, if not represented by
counsel, by the accepting party.
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 998(b).) If an
offer made by a defendant is not accepted and the plaintiff does not obtain a
more favorable judgment or award, the defendant is entitled to recover costs
from the time of the offer and may seek post-offer costs for expert witnesses
who are not regular employees of any party, provided those costs were actually
incurred and reasonably necessary to the trial. (Code Civ. Proc. § 998(c)(1).)
 
            The Court
of Appeal explained the rules governing section 998 offers as follows:
 
“In interpreting section 998, this
court has placed squarely on the offering party the burden of demonstrating
that the offer is a valid one under section 998. [Citation.] The corollary
to this rule is that a section 998 offer must be strictly construed
in favor of the party sought to be subjected to its operation. [Citation.]
Further, while the statute contemplates that an offer made pursuant to its
terms may properly include nonmonetary terms and conditions, the offer itself
must, nonetheless, be unconditional. [Citation.] Thus, for
example, an offer to two or more parties, which is contingent upon all parties'
acceptance, is not a valid offer under the statute. [Citations.] Finally, our
Supreme Court has held that the legislative purpose of section 998 is
generally better served by ‘bright line rules’ that can be applied to these
statutory settlement offers—at least with respect to the application of
contractual principles in determining the validity and enforceability of a
settlement agreement. [Citations.]” (Fn. omitted.) 
 
(Barella v. Exchange Bank (2000), 84 Cal.App.4th
793, 799-800, quoted by Sanford v. Rasnick (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
1121, 1129.) 
 
The inclusion of a term requiring
the drafting of a settlement agreement in an Offer to Compromise pursuant to
section 998 renders that offer conditional, and thus invalid. (Sanford v.
Rasnick (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 1121, 1129-30.) The burden of assuring that
the offer complies with section 998 falls on the offeror. (Taing
v. Johnson Scaffolding Co. (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 579, 585.) Any
ambiguity in the offer is interpreted against the offeror. (Chen v.
Interinsurance Exchange of Auto. Club (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 117, 122.)
However, an offer that does not comply with the statutory requirements is
invalid even if challenged by the drafting party. (Mostafavi Law Group, APC
v. Larry Rabineau, APC (2021) 61 Cal.App.5th 614, 625-26.) 
 
            Defendants
served Plaintiff Botach with a Section 998 Offer to Compromise and Acceptance,
with an appended Settlement Agreement and Release, on December 19, 2022.
(Declaration of Brian C. Lysaght ISO Mot. ¶ 2. Exh 1.) Defendants offered
Plaintiff Botach a sum of $100,000 in exchange for dismissal of the entire
action by this Plaintiff against all Defendants and a release of all claims,
known and unknown, on behalf of its successors and assigns. (Id. Exh.
1.A. ¶ B.) Plaintiff argues that accepting the settlement agreement would have
required YBREP to also release all its claims against Defendants, because YBREP
was Plaintiff’s “successor and assign.” Thus, Plaintiff argues that the 998 Offer
was a joint offer to both Plaintiffs, and since YBREP recovered $3,750,000
against Defendants, YBREP obtained a more favorable judgment than the offer to
compromise. 
 
            To
briefly summarize the various claims and their disposition in this action, both
Plaintiffs asserted claims for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud by way of
fraudulent concealment or false promise, professional negligence, and
declaratory relief. (See generally FAC.) Plaintiff Yoav Botach, and later his
Estate after his passing, also asserted a claim for financial elder abuse. (FAC
¶¶ 42-46.) The jury found in favor of YBREP and against Defendants on the
professional negligence cause of action only, and in favor of Defendants and
against the Estate of Yoav Botach on all causes of action. (June 27, 2023
Judgment.) The jury awarded YBREP only a total of $3,750,000 plus prejudgment
interest in economic damages. (Id.) 
 
            Plaintiff
Botach contends that because YBREP prevailed in the litigation, Botach should
be considered as having obtained a “more favorable result” because YBREP is
purportedly Botach’s “assignee and successor.” However, YBREP has never stood
as Botach’s assignee or successor in interest for the purposes of this action,
and no such allegation was ever presented in the pleadings. YBREP is not
Plaintiff’s assignee and successor merely because that argument is offered for
the first time on a Motion to Tax Costs. Plaintiff cites no authority standing
for the position that an Offer to Compromise which makes no reference to YBREP
whatsoever can be construed as an offer to both Plaintiffs jointly. Moreover, Plaintiff’s
argument that YBREP is Plaintiff’s successor or assignee implicitly asks the
Court to disregard the corporate form of Yoav Botach’s own Limited Liability
Corporation. Such a request is entirely improper. Plaintiff also asserts,
relying on the same unfounded contention, that Defendants’ 998 Offer was
unreasonable and made in bad faith because it required dismissal and release by
Plaintiff’s successors and assigns. These arguments are not persuasive. Plaintiff’s
further argument that the Offer “required agreement by multiple third parties
whose rights are affected by virtue of their liens being extinguished and their
creditor claims unpaid” is predicated on a severe misinterpretation of language
in the Release that merely requires Plaintiff Botach to hold Defendants not
liable for any lien on any recovery by the Estate. (Lysaght Decl. Exh. 1.A. ¶
R.)
            Finally,
Plaintiff argues that Defendants’ Offer to Compromise was unreasonably low, and
therefore the Court should not award additional expert fees. 
 
            As stated
by the Court of Appeal: 
 
Whether a section 998 offer is
reasonable must be determined by looking at circumstances when the offer was
made. However, the reasonableness of an offer depends upon the information used
to evaluate it. In many cases, a plaintiff and a defendant will not have the
same information when an offer is made. For this reason, the reasonableness of
an offer may lie in the eye of its beholder.
 
As a general rule, the reasonableness
of a defendant's offer is measured, first, by determining whether the offer
represents a reasonable prediction of the amount of money, if any, defendant
would have to pay plaintiff following a trial, discounted by an appropriate
factor for receipt of money by plaintiff before trial, all premised upon
information that was known or reasonably should have been known to the
defendant. It goes without saying that a defendant is not expected to predict
the exact amount of his exposure. If an experienced attorney or judge, standing
in defendant's shoes, would place the prediction within a range of reasonably
possible results, the prediction is reasonable. 
 
If the offer is found reasonable by the
first test, it must then satisfy a second test: whether defendant's information
was known or reasonably should have been known to plaintiff. This second test
is necessary because the section 998 mechanism works only where the offeree has
reason to know the offer is a reasonable one. If the offeree has no reason to
know the offer is reasonable, then the offeree cannot be expected to accept the
offer.
 
(Elrod v. Oregon Cummins Diesel, Inc. (1987) 195
Cal.App.3d 692, 700 [internal citations omitted].) Plaintiff makes no effort to
satisfy the reasonableness test, instead arguing only that the offer was
unreasonable because it was only $100,000, and offered at a very late stage of
the litigation, after Plaintiff had incurred considerable expenses already. Plaintiff
thus fails to demonstrate that the offer was unreasonable such that expert fees
should not be awarded. 
 
In sum, the Court is not persuaded
by Plaintiff Botach’s unsupported arguments that Defendants’ section 998 Offer
to Compromise with Botach was improper. Plaintiff also argues that, notwithstanding
the validity of the Offer to Compromise, the Memorandum of Costs does not
indicate the hours worked or hourly rate of the experts, and thus fails to
demonstrate how the fees were reached. Expert witness fees under section 998
are limited to the “reasonable and customary hourly or daily fee for the actual
time consumed in the examination of that witness by any party attending the
action or proceeding.” (Gov. Code § 68092.5(a).) Plaintiff’s characterization
of the fees claimed is correct: Defendants only set forth the hourly rate and
hours incurred for Stacey Wood and provide no information about the hourly rate
or the number of actual hours worked for any of the remaining witnesses.
(Memorandum Item 8b.) For Items 8b(1) through (3), Defendants state that each
expert only worked a single hour—a clear placeholder where the experts incurred
thousands of dollars in fees. (Id.) Plaintiff has properly objected to
these costs on this basis.
In opposition, Defendants provide a
breakdown of the fees incurred and invoices for the four experts for whom the
hourly rate and hours incurred were missing. Defendants state that witness
Bennet Blum, M.D. has an hourly rate of $800, and that he incurred $55,452.44
in fees after the Offer was made. (Declaration of Thomas J. Kearney ISO Opp. Exh.
F.) Defendants state that witness Lawrence H. Jacobson, Esq. has an hourly rate
of $450 and incurred post-offer fees of $21,534.95. (Id. Exh. G.) Witness
Lars Plat, MAI, CCIM has an hourly rate of $750 and incurred $7,704.38 in fees
post-offer. (Id. Exh. H.) Finally, Defendants paid Plaintiffs’ standard
of care expert Alan Wallace $790 for two hours of deposition on December 22,
2022. (Id. Exh. I.) Defendants have thus accounted for $85,481.77 in
post-offer expert witness fees. Upon review of the invoices presented, the
Court agrees that these fees are reasonably incurred and necessary to the
litigation. However, Defendants do not account for the remainder of the costs requested
and have therefore failed to justify the remaining costs. The Court therefore
will order this item taxed by $82,055.68, representing the unaccounted-for
costs. 
 
3.     
Court Reporter Fees
 
Plaintiff’s final challenge is to Item
12(c) which claims court reporter and transcript fees in the amount of
$89,039.50. Plaintiff seeks to tax this item by $85,172.00 on the basis that
the Court only ordered transcripts for one day of trial, and the remaining fees
are for transcripts not ordered by the Court and therefore not recoverable
under Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5(b)(5). Plaintiff is conflating transcript fees, which are excluded
under section 1033.5(a)(9), with court reporter fees, which are covered
by 1033.5(a)(11). As stated by the Court of Appeal in ruling on exactly this
issue in Chaaban v. Wet Seal, Inc, “These charges are not for
transcripts. They are for court reporter fees, an entirely different expense.
The parties have to pay the court reporter regardless of whether anyone orders
transcripts.” (Chaaban v. Wet Seal, Inc. (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 49, 58.)
Plaintiff has therefore not demonstrated that these costs should be taxed.
 
Conclusion
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiff the Estate of Yoav Botach’s Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED IN PART.
Defendants’ claim for expert fees under Item 8b is taxed in the amount of $82,055.68,
thus permitting a cost award to Defendants of $219,570.06.
 
CONCLUSION: 
Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to Tax Costs is GRANTED IN
PART. Plaintiff’s claimed costs for $242.00 under Item 12 in transcripts not
ordered by the court, $2,193.55 under Item 16 related to photocopying of
documents and $119.18 under Item 16 related to postage are hereby stricken. The
Court taxes a total of $2,554.73 in requested costs, thus authorizing a cost
award to Plaintiff of $38,588.02.
