Significant Statements:
  - "The Court cannot find, as a matter of law, that Mr. Pico's letter halted the interactive process and turned to a resolution that would have separated Plaintiff from her employment."
  - "What is more, even if Mr. Pico's letter mirrored the attorney correspondence in the cited cases, it would not invalidate Plaintiff's claims since there is ample evidence to create a triable issue of fact regarding whether Defendant aborted the interactive process before the letter."
  - "To grant Defendant's motion would be tantamount to finding Plaintiff waived her right to pursue damages for some of the injuries she suffered, but the record does not reflect an intentional relinquishment of a known right."

Summary in English:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on three motions filed by the defendant, Aide Healthcare. The first motion seeks to exclude evidence related to communications or damages beyond July 30, 2021, when the plaintiff terminated the interactive process. The judge has denied this motion, finding that the plaintiff's letter on July 30, 2021, did not constitute abandonment of the interactive process.

The second motion seeks to exclude evidence or argument suggesting that the plaintiff suffered emotional distress beyond the "usual" garden-variety distress associated with her employment claim. The judge has granted this motion in part, finding that the stipulation signed by the plaintiff limits the scope of admissible evidence to "garden-variety" emotional distress. However, the judge has also found that the stipulation does not waive the plaintiff's right to present her emotional symptomatology, including suicidal thoughts.

The third motion seeks to exclude the plaintiff's expert, Angel Ho. The judge has denied this motion, finding that testimony from human resources experts may be helpful to the jury and admissible over the defendant's objections, depending on its nature.

Overall, the judge has denied the defendant's motions, finding that the plaintiff's claims are not barred by the interactive process and that the stipulation signed by the plaintiff does not waive her right to present her emotional symptomatology.
