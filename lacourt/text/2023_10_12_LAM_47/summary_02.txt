And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Bruce Dwain Copeland v. Amy Pham, case number 22STCV10036. The case involves a dispute over ownership of a property, with Copeland claiming that Pham is fraudulently claiming ownership.

Copeland has moved to deem the truth of matters in requests for admission propounded to Pham, but the judge has denied the motion. The judge has also granted Pham's request for sanctions against Copeland in the amount of $1,910, due to Copeland's misuse of the discovery process by propounding requests for admission during a stay of the litigation.

The judge's ruling is based on the fact that Copeland had no right to propound discovery while the motion to deem a vexatious litigant was pending, and that Copeland ignored Pham's objection and persisted in pursuing discovery that was not permissible as a matter of law.
