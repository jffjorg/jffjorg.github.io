Plaintiff’s Motions to Deem the

DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiff moves to deem the truth

Amy Pham.
 
Request for Judicial Notice
 
            Defendant
requests that the Court take judicial notice of (1) the docket in this action
and (2) the several sequential oppositions filed by Defendant in connection
with these motions. Defendant’s request is GRANTED pursuant to Evidence Code
section 452(d) (court records). 
 
Legal
Standard
 
When a party to
whom requests for admission are directed fails to respond, the party
propounding the requests may move for an order that the truth of any matters
specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(b).)
“The court shall make this order [deem the requests admitted], unless it finds
that the party to whom the request for admissions have been directed has
served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed response to the requests
for admission that is in substantial compliance with section 2033.220.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 2033.280(c).)
 
Analysis
 
            On
April 26, 2023, Defendant U.S. Bank National Association filed and served a
Motion to Deem Plaintiff a Vexatious Litigant pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 391.1. (April 26, 2023 Motion to Deem Vexatious Litigant.) Defendant
Amy Pham joined that motion on May 2, 2023. (Joinder to Motion filed May 2,
2023.) The filing of a motion to deem a plaintiff a vexatious litigant
automatically stays the litigation, subject to exceptions not relevant here,
until 10 days after either denial of the motion or, if the motion is granted,
furnishing of the required security and written notice given by the moving
defendant thereof. (Code Civ. Proc. § 391.6.) Although no proof of service is
attached to the requests for admissions, Plaintiff’s motions state on their
face that the Requests for Admissions that are the subject of these motions
were served on Defendant Pham on May 5, 2023, three days after her joinder to
the vexatious litigant motion and nine days after the motion was filed and
served. (See also Motion Exh. 1 [email with Requests for Admissions dated May
5, 2023].)  The Court granted the motion
on May 24, 2023, and required Plaintiff to furnish security as to U.S. Bank,
but not as to Defendant Pham. (May 24, 2023 Minute Order.) As Defendant Pham
correctly states in opposition to these motions, Plaintiff had no right to
propound discovery on May 5, 2023, while the Motion to Deem Plaintiff a
Vexatious Litigant was pending, as the entire action was stayed at that time. 
 
            Plaintiff
is therefore not entitled to an order deeming the truth of the matters in these
requests for admissions.
 
Sanctions
 
            Defendant
request sanctions against Plaintiff for propounding discovery during a stay of
the litigation. 
 
            The
Court may impose a monetary sanction on a party engaging in a misuse of the
discovery process to pay the reasonable expenses incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.030(a).) Use of a discovery method in
a manner that does not comply with its specified procedures is a misuse of the
discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(b).) Persisting, over objection
and without substantial justification, in an attempt to obtain information or
materials that are outside the scope of permissible discovery is also a misuse
of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.010(a).) 
 
            Here,
Defendant requests a total of $4,935 in sanctions against Plaintiff on each
motion. Defendant initially demanded $2,000 in sanctions, based on 3.2 hours of
attorney time actually incurred on these motions, plus an additional
anticipated hour, plus $5 in filing fees. (August 28, 2023 Declaration of Larry
Rothman ISO Opp ¶ 2.) Defendant purports to have subsequently demanded an
additional $1,980 in sanctions, based on 6 hours of attorney time actually
billed, divided in half, plus $5 in filing fees. (See October 6, 2023 Request
for Judicial Notice; September 18 Declaration of Larry Rothman ISO Opp. ¶ 2.) However,
no such filing was ever received by the Court. Defendant now demands a further $955
in fees, based on another 6 hours of attorney time divided by three, plus $5 in
filing fees. (October 6, 2023 Declaration of Larry Rothman ISO Opp. ¶ 2.) 
 
            Defendant
has provided evidence that her counsel advised Plaintiff directly that the
requests for admissions were improperly propounded in violation of the stay of
litigation under Code of Civil Procedure section 391.6. (August 28, 2023
Opposition, p. 8.) Plaintiff ignored Defendant’s objection and persisted in
pursuing discovery which was not permissible as a matter of law. Further,
Plaintiff has provided no justification for filing these motions in violation
of the stay. The Court therefore finds that Plaintiff has engaged in a misuse
of the discovery process and that monetary sanctions are warranted. That said,
the Court declines to impose the full amount of sanctions requested.
Defendant’s opposition to Plaintiff’s virtually identical motions were
themselves likewise identical, and thus awarding the full amount of sanctions
would be inappropriately duplicative. Moreover, the Court finds, based on the
relative brevity of Defendant’s papers and the absence of the purported
September 18, 2023 Declarations, that Defendant’s request for fees is inflated.
The Court will therefore award monetary sanctions in the total amount of $1,910,
based on 4 hours of attorney time at $475, plus $10 in filing fees. 
 
//
 
CONCLUSION
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motions
to Deem the Truth of Matters in Requests for Admissions are DENIED. 
 
Defendant Pham’s request for
sanctions is GRANTED in the amount of $1,910 against Plaintiff. Payment
is to be made within 30 days of this order. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
