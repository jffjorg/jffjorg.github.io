And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Olivia Rosales, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Performance Marketing, LLC (Plaintiff) v. Thor Motor Coach, Inc. and Mike Thompson RV (Defendants). The Defendant has moved to stay the action pursuant to a forum selection clause in the warranty, which provides that Indiana is the exclusive jurisdiction for claims under the warranty. The Judge has granted the Defendant's Motion to Stay, finding that the forum selection clause is enforceable. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff's Song-Beverly Act rights can be readily preserved and that the forum selection clause is not unconscionable. The matter is stayed during the pendency of the matter in Indiana courts, and the Plaintiff may move to lift the stay if the Indiana court declines to apply the Song-Beverly Act.
