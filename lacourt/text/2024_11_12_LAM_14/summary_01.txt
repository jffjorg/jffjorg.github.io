And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to consolidate and transfer the case. The plaintiff, Michael McKinsey, is seeking to consolidate his case with an unlawful detainer action (24SMUD02110) and transfer it to the same department. However, the plaintiff has not filed a notice of related case in both actions as required by the court's rules. The judge cannot rule on the motion until the two matters have been deemed related into a single department. The plaintiff must comply with the court's rules and file the necessary notice before the motion can be considered.
