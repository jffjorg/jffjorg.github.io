And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion to transfer the case to the Pomona Courthouse. However, the motion is taken off-calendar because the defendant failed to provide a valid proof of service. The proof of service attached to the motion does not comply with the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1013b, which states that the proof of electronic service must set forth the exact title of the document served and filed in the cause. Despite the motion being unopposed, the judge will not entertain the motion absent evidence of proper service.
