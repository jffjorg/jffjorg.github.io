And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to relate the two cases, 18STCV07563 and BC408948. The motion was filed by Defendants and Cross-Defendants Michael Khorshidi and Nejatolah Rabbanian, who argued that the cases should be related because they involve the same parties and are based on similar claims. However, the judge found that the cases do not involve the same parties and are based on different claims.

The judge noted that the only remaining issue in BC408948 is to appoint an elisor to effectuate Khorshidi and Rabbanian's sale of their interests in the joint venture, while the remaining claims in 18STCV07563 are unrelated to this issue. The judge also found that the cases do not require a substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges, and that the stay issued in 18STCV07563 addresses any potential duplication of judicial resources.

The judge concluded that the cases are not related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300, and denied the motion.
