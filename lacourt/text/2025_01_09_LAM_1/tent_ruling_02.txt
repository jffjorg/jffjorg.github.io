D. Farkhondehpour, Alex Farkhondehpour, and Kristina Farkhondehpour arising out

On

the November 9, 2022 ruling declining to relate the two cases. 
 
On
May 2, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Related Case involving 21STCV43562
and 22SMSC00349 The 1993 Farkhondehpour Family Trust v Project Rumor LLC, et
al. Judge Fruin declined to relate these two cases on May 3, 2023.

Motion 
 
On September 23, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the
instant Motion to Relate and Consolidate Non-Complex Cases.
 
Plaintiffs’ notice of motion lacks clarity as
it states Plaintiffs “will move the Court for an that the following actions
pending in the County of Los Angeles Santa Monica Courthouse, to this Court,” [sic]
(Notice at 1:26-28), and move the presiding judge of the Los Angeles
Superior Court for an Order that the two above-referenced cases are related and
to consolidate the matters.” However, the notice lists six cases, one of which
is described as being filed in Kewaunee County Wisconsin:
 
-       
21SMUD00453 Farkhondehpour v. Project
Rumor;
 
-       
21STCV43562 Maghbouleh v.
Farkhondehpour;
 
-       
22SMSC00349 The 1993 Farkhondehpour
Family Trust vs. Project Rumor;
 
-       
22SMCV00286 The 1993 Farkhondehpour
Family Trust vs. Project Rumor;
 
-       
Kewaunee County Wisconsin Case
2024CV000028 The 1993 Farkhondehpour Family Trust v Ravi Patel; and 
 
-       
23STCV20236 Karim vs. Project Rumor.
Additionally,
the caption suggests the motion is supported by the declaration of Armand J.
Jaarari and a request for judicial notice. Neither were filed with the court. 
 
Plaintiffs’ Motion is Procedurally
Improper
 
Invalid Proof of Service
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
1013b, a valid proof of electronic service must “set[] forth the exact title of
the document served and filed in the cause.” 
 
The proof of service attached to Plaintiffs’
motion fails to comply with this requirement as it states: “On September
23, 2024, I served on the parties of record in this action the foregoing
document described as NOTICE OF ADDRESS CHANGE addressed as follows:” 
 
The motion is unopposed and the time to file
a valid proof of service has expired. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.1300(c) (“Proof of
service of the moving papers must be filed no later than five court days before
the time appointed for the hearing.”).) To satisfy due process, the moving
party must provide evidence of proper service. (See generally, McMillin
v. Eare (2021) 70 Cal.App.5th 893, 913 (describing the “right to notice,
which is an element of due process.”).)
 
Accordingly, the motion is procedurally
defective due to the absence of proper service.
 
There is No Procedural Basis to Relate,
Consolidate, or Coordinate the Listed Cases
 
Additionally,
the Notice of Motion lists five Los Angeles Superior Court cases and one case
from Wisconsin.
 
The
California Rules of Court and the Local Rules of the Los Angeles Superior Court
do not provide a mechanism for Department 1 to relate, consolidate, or
coordinate cases from other states. (See Cal. R. Ct., rules 3.300 et seq;
LASC Local Rules, rule 3.3.) Thus, Department 1 cannot provide any relief
related to Kewaunee County Wisconsin Case 2024CV000028 The 1993 Farkhondehpour
Family Trust v Ravi Patel.

Furthermore, all the cases listed in the Notice of Motion from the Los Angeles
Superior Court, except 21STCV43562, have been dismissed or disposed of by
judgment. Pursuant to Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rule 3.3(f)(3), “Department
1 shall hear the motion [to relate], if the cases are all pending in the
Central District or are pending in two or more different districts.” Thus, Department
1 only considers pending cases when ruling on a motion to relate cases. With
only one pending case listed in the motion, there are no other cases for
Department 1 to consider relating with 21STCV43562.
 
Conclusion
 
For
all the reasons stated herein, Plaintiffs’ Motion to Relate and Consolidate
Non-Complex Case is taken OFF-CALENDAR for lack of proper service.
 
Clerk
shall give notice.
