And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that cases 23STCV09093 and 24STCV01230 are related and should be heard together. The cases were filed by the same plaintiff, Heidy Garcia, against different defendants, Commercial Property Management, Inc. dba LA Rentals and Oxford Grand, LLC, respectively. The cases both involve the same property, 450 South Kenmore Ave. Apt. 206, Los Angeles, CA 90020, and both raise questions about the plaintiff's rent payments. The judge finds that the cases are related and will require a significant duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges. The motion to relate the cases is therefore granted, and the first-filed case will not be the lead case. The judge also orders that the second case, 24STCV01230, be reassigned to Department 39 of the Stanley Mosk Courthouse for all purposes.
