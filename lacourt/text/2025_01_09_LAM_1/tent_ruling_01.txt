  Case Number:  18STCV07563    Hearing Date:   January 9, 2025    Dept:  1 Background of 18STCV07563 Jahaheri v. Abdi
 
On December 7, 2018, Plaintiffs Alexander
Javaheri and David Javaheri filed this action against Parviz Abdi, Michael
Khorshidi, and Nejatolah Rabbanian. The First Amended Complaint, filed November
12, 2021, asserted causes of action for: (1) breach of contract; (2) specific
performance; (3) declaratory relief; (4) enforcement of judgment; (5)
declaratory relief; (6) unjust enrichment / restitution; and (7) money had and
received.
 
The FAC alleged the parties were part of a
joint venture named 5th & LA, “with ownership as follows: Alexander
Javaheri 10% David Javaheri 10% Parviz Abdi 20% Michael Khorshidi 30% Nejatolah
Rabbanian 30%.” (FAC ¶ 10.) “The purpose of the Joint Venture was to purchase
land in downtown Los Angeles, remove the existing buildings, erect a building
and operate a new structure as a swap meet.” (Id. ¶ 11.) Defendants allegedly
underreported cash received from operating the business to misappropriate the
proceeds and used the property as collateral for a loan made to purchase
property for a competing business. The parties’ previously litigated several
cases in arbitration and in the Los Angeles Superior Court, resulting in
judgments against Khorshidi, Rabbanian, and Abdi. Plaintiffs allege Khorshidi and Rabbanian refused to sell their
interests in the joint venture as required and improperly collected
distributions. Plaintiffs seek to purchase the interests at the 2013 appraised
value. Plaintiffs also request a declaration regarding the potential expiration
of the joint venture agreement and for Khorshidi and Rabbanian to pay
the sum owed pursuant to the judgment entered in BC408948. 
 
On November 12, 2021, Abdi filed the First Amended
Cross-Complaint against Khorshidi, Rabbanian, Alexander Javaheri, and David
Javaheri asserting causes of action for: (1) breach of contract (damages); (2)
breach of contract (specific performance); (3) breach of contract (mandatory
injunction); (4) enforcement of judgment (CCP § 683.050); (5) declaratory
relief (JV Agreement); (6) declaratory relief (judgment); (7) unjust
enrichment; and (8) money had and received. The FACC alleges Khorshidi
and Rabbanian breached the joint venture agreement by failing to sell a portion
of their interest to Abdi and continuing to collect distributions. Abdi also seeks
to purchase an interest at the 2013 appraised value and requests a judgment
requiring  Khorshidi and Rabbanian to pay the sum
owed pursuant to the judgment entered in BC408948.
 
On August 22, 2022, the court sustained
Parviz Abdi’s demurrer to the second, third, and fourth causes of action in the
First Amended Complaint without leave to amend. The court also sustained Defendants
Michael Khorshidi and Nejatolah Rabbanian’s demurrer to the seventh cause of
action in the First Amended Cross-Complaint without leave to amend on August 22, 2022.
 
On September 21, 2022, Khorshidi and
Rabbanian filed a cross-complaint against Abdi, Alexander Javaheri and David
Javaheri asserting causes of action for: (1) dissolution; (2) breach of
fiduciary duty; (3) declaratory relief; (4) declaratory relief; and (5)
accounting. This cross-complaint seeks to dissolve and windup the joint venture
and obtain a new appraisal for the venture. The cross-complaint also alleges  Alexander
Javaheri and David Javaheri improperly managed and operated the property,
rather than a neutral third-party, to the detriment of the joint venture. 
 
On December 26, 2023, the court denied Abdi’s
motion for summary adjudication regarding the duties owed by Khorshidi and
Rabbanian.  
 
On
June 20, 2024, the court entered the parties’ stipulation and order to stay
18STCV07563 in its entirety and the action remains stayed in Department 19 of
the Stanley Mosk Courthouse before Judge Stephanie Bowick.
 
Background
of BC408948 Khorshidi v. Javaheri
 
On March 4, 2009, Khorshidi and Rabbanian
sued Alexander Javaheri and David Javaheri based upon allegations that Alexander
Javaheri and David Javaheri breached the joint venture agreement by assuming
control of the venture, appointing an attorney for the venture, transferring
accounting responsibilities for the venture, hiring contractors with whom they
had existing relationships, and sending a letter accusing Khorshidi and
Rabbanian of breaching the agreement requiring Khorshidi and Rabbanian to sell
their interests. 
 
Alexander Javaheri and David Javaheri filed a
cross-complaint alleging Khorshidi and Rabbanian defaulted on the joint venture
agreement and sought to invoke the right to purchase Khorshidi and Rabbanian’s
interests. Abdi filed a similar cross-complaint to invoke the right to purchase
an interest. 
 
On July 17, 2017, the court entered judgment
in favor of Alexander Javaheri, David Javaheri, and Abdi requiring Khorshidi
and Rabbanian to allow Alexander Javaheri, David Javaheri, and Abdi to exercise
the right to purchase their interests. The Court of Appeal affirmed the
judgment on August 5, 2021. 
 
On November 1, 2019, Judge Robert Broadbelt issued
an order declining to relate BC408948 with 18STCV07563.
 
On April 14, 2023, the court denied a motion
for elisor to enforce the judgment. The Court of Appeal reversed this ruling on
May 15, 2024. The Court of Appeal concluded in its opinion: “the parties
continue to disagree about how the 2017 judgment should be enforced. Because
the valuation was completed in 2013, the parties and court will need to
determine, for example, the effects of years’ worth of distributions, tax
liabilities, and other details. We express no opinion on these matters; the
parties and trial court are in the best position to determine them in the first
instance. However, these details cannot serve as a basis to undermine the
court's 2017 award of specific performance to J&A. Because K&R have
refused to comply with the judgment for specific performance—a fact K&R do
not deny—J&A were entitled to the remedy of an elisor to enforce the
judgment.” (Khorshidi v. Javaheri (Cal. Ct. App., May 15, 2024, No.
B329246) 2024 WL 2169260, at *10.) 
 
This action is assigned to Department 51 of
the Stanley Mosk Courthouse with the next hearing set for January 23, 2025.
 
Motion 
 
On
October 1, 2024,  Khorshidi and Rabbanian filed the instant motion seeking to relate
18STCV07563 and BC408948 and have the cases reassigned to Department 19.
 
Opposition
 
In their opposition, Alexander Javaheri and
David Javaheri contend the cases are not related as the only remaining issue in
BC408948 is the final buyout price and allocation of the interests. The
opposition also argues the motion is an improper attempt to judge shop.
 
In a separate opposition, Abdi similarly
argues the only remaining issue in BC408948 is the calculation of adjustments
to the 2013 appraisal price, there is no overlap between the cases, and they
should remain as assigned.
 
Reply
 
In reply, Khorshidi and Rabbanian argue
relating the cases is more judicially efficient and Judge Bowick has more
substantive involvement in the parties’ litigation history. 
 
Judicial Notice
 
The parties’ requests for judicial notice of
various court documents filed in the two cases are GRANTED. (Evid. Code §
452(d).) 
 
Motion to Relate Cases 
 
Department 1 Does Not Relate Pending
Cases with Cases Reduced to Judgment
 
Pursuant
to Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rule 3.3(f)(3), “[i]n the event that the
judge designated under California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1)(A)(B)(C) to
make the decision, does not order related any of the cases set forth in the
Notice of Related Cases, any party may file a motion to have the cases related.
Department 1 shall hear the motion, if the cases are all pending in the Central
District or are pending in two or more different districts.” As noted by the
moving parties, “the 2009 Case is closed having been disposed of by judgment in
2017 and the remaining disputes are all post-judgment issues, while the 2018
Case is still currently pending . . .” (Mot. at 5:25-27.) 
 
Accordingly,
BC408948 is no longer pending for purposes of Local Rule 3.3(f)(3) and there is
no basis for Department 1 to relate the two cases at issue.
 
The
Motion Seeks to Assign the Cases to an Incorrect Department 
 
Pursuant
to California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1)(A), “[w]here all the cases
listed in the notice are unlimited civil cases, or where all the cases listed
in the notice are limited civil cases, the judge who has the earliest filed
case must determine whether the cases must be ordered related and assigned to
his or her department.” 
 
Thus,
an order relating two unlimited civil cases results in the cases being assigned
to the judicial officer with the earliest filed case. Here, BC408948 is the
earliest filed case and is assigned to Judge Upinder Kalra in Department 51 of
Stanley Mosk Courthouse. The moving parties’ request that the cases be related
and assigned to Judge Bowick, who presides over 18STCV07563, is improper and not
supported by any legal authority. Accordingly, the parties’ discussions
regarding Judge Bowick’s familiarity with the parties’ case is not a basis to
relate the cases.
 
Separately, Department 1 Declines to
Relate the Cases at Issue on the Merits
 
Cases
are related when they (1) involve the same parties and are based on the same or
similar claims, (2) arise from the same or substantially identical transactions,
incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or substantially
identical questions of law or fact, (3) involve claims against, title to, possession
of, or damages to the same property, or (4) are likely for other reasons to
require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different
judges. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a).)
 
Moving
parties argue the cases are related based upon the first, second, and fourth
grounds enumerated in Rule 3.300. 
 
The
parties agree the only remaining issue in BC408948 is to appoint an elisor to
effectuate Khorshidi and Rabbanian’s sale of their interests in the joint
venture and how the sale should proceed. (Mot. at 9:14-18; Abdi Opp. at
3:13-16; Javaheri Opp. at 6:14-20; Reply at 3:25-4:1.) The moving parties also
agree the Court of Appeal’s ruling in BC408948 “effectively mooted” numerous
issues in 18STCV07563. (Abdi Opp. at 6:15-7:14; Reply at 4:3-6.) 
 
Accordingly,
the cases do not involve the same parties and are based on the same or similar
claims and do not arise from the same or substantially identical transactions,
incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or substantially
identical questions of law or fact. (Cal. R. Ct., rules 3.300(a)(1);
3.300(a)(2).) The remaining claim and questions of law and fact in BC408948 are
limited and do not include Khorshidi and Rabbanian’s claims regarding the
termination of the venture and alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. To the
extent the cases may have involved similar issues, the issues appear moot and
are not likely to be adjudicated in 18STCV07563. 
 
Given
the limited issue remaining in BC408948, the cases are not likely to require a
substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges.
(Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(4).) The moving parties argue resolving the one
issue in BC408948 “necessarily impacts the resolution of the 2018 Case.” (Reply
at 2:17-19.) However, cases are not related solely because one may impact the
outcome of another. Any potential duplication of judicial resources is largely
addressed by the stay issued in 18STCV07563. In the parties’ stipulation, they
agreed 18STCV07563 should be stayed “pending resolution of the Appeal and/or
the 2009 Action.”
 
The
Court finds the cases are not related within the meaning of California Rules of
Court, rule 3.300 and the motion is DENIED. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants
and Cross-Defendants Michael Khorshidi and Nejatolah Rabbanian’s Motion to
Relate Cases is DENIED.
 
Counsel
for Alexander Javaheri and David Javaheri shall give notice.
