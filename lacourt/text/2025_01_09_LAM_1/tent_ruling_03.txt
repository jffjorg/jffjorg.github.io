Motion

 
On October 2,
2024, Defendant Commercial Property Management, Inc. dba LA Rentals filed the
instant motion seeking to relate 23STCV09093 and 24STCV01230.  The motion did not include 23STCV17481.
 
The motion is
unopposed. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1005.)
 
Motion to Relate Cases
 
Standard 
 
In the event that the
pertinent judge under California Rules of Court, rule 3.300(h)(1) does not
relate any of the cases set forth in a Notice of Related Case, Department 1 may
relate the matters on noticed motion. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(D); LASC
Local Rules, rule 3.3(f)(3).) 
 
Discussion
 
As described above, Defendant filed
several Notices of Related Cases involving 23STCV09093 and 24STCV01230 without obtaining an order relating
the two cases. Accordingly, Defendant’s motion is
properly made in Department 1. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(h)(1)(D), LASC
Local Rule 3.3(f)(3).)   
 
Cases are related when they (1) involve
the same parties and are based on the same or similar claims, (2) arise from
the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events
requiring the determination of the same or substantially identical questions of
law or fact, (3) involve claims against, title to, possession of, or damages to
the same property, or (4) are likely for other reasons to require substantial
duplication of judicial resources if heard by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct.,
rule 3.300(a).)
 
As seen above, the cases do not involve
the same parties as the Defendants are different in each case. (Cal. R. Ct.,
rule 3.300(a)(1).) The cases also do not assert property claims and therefore
do not involve claims against, title to, possession of, or damages to the same
property. (Cal. R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(3).) 
 
However, the cases arise from the same
or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the
determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact, (Cal.
R. Ct., rule 3.300(a)(2)), and are likely to require a substantial duplication
of judicial resources if heard by different judges. (Cal. R. Ct., rule
3.300(a)(4).) Both cases appear to involve Plaintiff’s tenancy at 450 South
Kenmore Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90020, which Defendant’s counsel indicates are
known as the “Oxford Grand Apartments.” (Campo Decl. ¶ 7.) In a motion for
summary judgment filed on September 5, 2024 in 23STCV09093, Plaintiff requested
a “rent stop,” (Campo Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. B), and the complaint in 24STCV01230
requests rent back pay. Therefore, Plaintiff’s rent payments are at issue in
both cases. On March 1, 2024, Plaintiff filed a document captioned “Final
Demand” in 24STCV01230, which includes the case number 23STCV09093. The cases
will require the determination of identical questions of law and fact related
to Plaintiff’s tenancy and having a single judicial officer preside over both
cases promotes judicial economy. Department 1 finds the cases are related
within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule 3.300.  
 
The motion is GRANTED. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Commercial Property
Management, Inc.’s Motion to Deem Cases Related is GRANTED. 
 
While normally the first-filed case
would be the lead case, here Department 1 exercises its discretion and relates 23STCV09093
with 24STCV01230, and orders 24STCV09093 reassigned to Department 39 of the
Stanley Mosk Courthouse for all purposes. All hearings currently set in 24STCV09093
are hereby advanced and vacated.  
 
Counsel for Defendant to give notice.
