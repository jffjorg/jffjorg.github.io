 Case Number:  BC184355    Hearing Date:   January 9, 2025    Dept:  1 Background
 
On August 20, 1999, Judge Alexander H.
Williams III formally declared Graham Berry a vexatious litigant in Los Angeles
Superior Court case BC184355 Berry
v. Cipriano. Under this order,
Berry became subject to a Code of Civil Procedure section 391.7 prefiling
requirement that requires Berry to obtain the permission of the presiding judge
to file new litigation. Permission is granted only if it appears the litigation
has merit and is not being filed for purposes of harassment or delay. (Code
Civ. Proc. § 391.7(b).) In Los Angeles Superior Court, the Presiding Judge has
designated the Supervising Judge of the Civil Division (sitting in Dept.
1) to exercise this authority and responsibility. (See Code Civ. Proc.
391.7(e).) 
 
On October
3, 2023, Judge Michelle Williams Court, then sitting in Department 1, issued an
order granting Berry’s application to vacate the prefiling order and remove his
name from the Judicial Council’s list of vexatious litigants.
 
Motion 
 
On September 9, 2024, Church of
Scientology International, Kendrick L. Moxon and Mary Ann Chait as Trustee and
Beneficiary of the Trust of Isadore and Mary Ann Chait filed the instant motion
for reconsideration of the October 3, 2023 order.
 
Opposition
 
In
opposition, Berry contends the court lacks jurisdiction to rule on a motion for
reconsideration, the movants lack standing, and the motion fails to demonstrate
new or different facts or law to support reconsideration. 
 
Reply
 
In
reply, Movants argue the October 3, 2023 order is void, the motion satisfies
Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, and the Court should reconsider the order
and restore Berry to the vexatious litigant list.
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
 
Berry’s request for judicial notice of the
application to vacate prefiling order and the orders entered thereon is
GRANTED. (Evid. Code § 452(d).) 
 
Evidentiary Objections
 
Berry’s objections to the Moxon declaration
and its exhibits are SUSTAINED.
 
The objections to the Soter declaration are OVERRULED.
 
Motion for Reconsideration
 
“When an application for an order has been
made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or granted, or
granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order may, within
10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of the order
and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make application
to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the matter and
modify, amend, or revoke the prior order. The party making the application
shall state by affidavit what application was made before, when and to what
judge, what order or decisions were made, and what new or different facts,
circumstances, or law are claimed to be shown.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
1008(a).)  
 
Judge Michelle Williams Court is no longer a
judicial officer with the Los Angeles Superior Court and is therefore
unavailable. Department 1 is the proper department to rule on the motion. (In re Marriage of Oliverez (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1247 (“A trial
court's discretion to reconsider another judge's prior ruling is necessarily
narrow and usually only appropriate when the prior judge is unavailable.”).) 
 
Movants Fail to Demonstrate the Motion
is Procedurally Proper
 
The request for relief in the instant motion
is solely based upon Code of Civil Procedure section 1008(a). (See Mot. at
7:9-10; 21:6-19.) 
 
Movants contend “[d]espite the
requirements of C.C.P § 465, no service was provided to any counsel of record
in any of the three-related cases in which the Application was filed” and the order was not served upon anyone other
than Berry and the Judicial Council. (Id. at 21:14-19.) Therefore, Movants
argue, the 10-day deadline under Section 1008(a) did not begin to run and their
motion is proper and timely. Movants reiterate their reliance upon Code of
Civil Procedure section 465 in their reply. (Reply at 2:19-21; 5:24-26.)
 
However, Code of Civil Procedure section 465 governs
the service of pleadings: “all pleadings subsequent to the complaint, together
with proof of service unless a summons need be issued, shall be filed with the
clerk or judge, and copies thereof served upon the adverse party or his or her
attorney.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 465.) Therefore, it is inapplicable to Berry’s
application to vacate the prefiling order, which Movants’ own authority, Code
of Civil Procedure section 1003, demonstrates is not a pleading. (Notice at 2
n.1 citing Code Civ. Proc. § 1003 (“An application for an order is a motion.”);
People v. Financial Casualty & Surety, Inc. (2021) 73 Cal.App.5th
33, 40 (“To begin with, a motion is not a pleading.”); Code Civ. Proc. § 422.10
(“The pleadings allowed in civil actions are complaints, demurrers, answers,
and cross-complaints.”).)
 
Service of motions is governed by Code of
Civil Procedure section 1005(a). Applications to vacate a prefiling order
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 391.8 are not among the twelve
specifically enumerated items in Section 1005(a). The catchall provision, Code
of Civil Procedure section 1005(a)(13), provides “[w]ritten notice shall be
given, . . . for the following motions: . . . [a]ny other proceeding under this
code in which notice is required, and no other time or method is prescribed by
law or by court or judge.” Code of Civil Procedure section 391.8 does not
require notice, which can be contrasted with Code of Civil Procedure section 533,
cited by Movants in reply. (Reply at 5:26-27; Code Civ. Proc. § 533 (“In any
action, the court may on notice modify or dissolve an injunction . . .”).) Movants
also failed to demonstrate the application to vacate a prefiling order must
comply with the California Rules of Court governing ex parte applications. Unlike
ex parte applications, applications to vacate a prefiling order are generally
not calendared or set for hearing. 
 
Movants also cite Novak v. Fay (2015)
236 Cal.App.4th 329 in which the court held a party was not required to file a
motion for reconsideration to preserve an issue on appeal. (Id. at 336 (“For the foregoing reasons, plaintiff was not required
to file a reconsideration motion. The section 9391 issue has been
preserved.”).) In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeal noted “[n]o
notice of entry of any order made at the July 31, 2013 hearing was ever served
on plaintiff. Thus, the 10-day requirement imposed by Code of Civil Procedure
section 1008, subdivision (a) is inapplicable.” (Id. at 335–336.) The
order at issue involved ongoing litigation and was not related to a vexatious
litigant matter governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 391 et seq. 
 
The Court finds Movants have not demonstrated
they were entitled to service of Berry’s application or the Court’s prior order.
Movants presume without providing authority, that their motion for
reconsideration, filed eleven months after entry of an application to vacate a
prefiling order, is procedurally proper. On this basis, the motion is properly
DENIED. However, the Court shall address the parties’ remaining arguments. 
 
In opposition, Berry contends the Court lacks
jurisdiction to consider a motion for reconsideration because the case has been
dismissed and reduced to judgment. (Opp. at 1:25-3:8.) However, Berry cites
authority regarding reconsideration of a judgment or prejudgment motion, not an
ancillary post-judgment order. (See APRI Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 176 (reconsideration of order granting motion to quash
service of process); G.R. v. Intelligator (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 606
(reconsideration of attorney fees and costs awarded with special motion to
strike); 20th Century Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th
1247 (reconsideration of order sustaining demurrer without leave to amend);
Marshall v. Webster (2020) 54 Cal.App.5th 275 (reconsideration
of order granting special motion to strike).) Berry also cites Pittman v.
Beck Park Apartments Ltd. (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 1009, 1026, which did not
address the applicability of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008.
 
The Court finds entry of a dismissal in 1999 would
not preclude reconsideration of a post-judgment order entered in 2023. (D.R.S.
Trading Co., Inc. v. Barnes (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 815, 821 (“It is clear
that section 1008 allows the trial court . . . to reconsider orders made after
the judgment, as long it does so in accordance with the requirements of the
statute.”); In re Marriage of Barthold (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1313
(“the fact that the order in this case was issued after judgment, and in that
sense was ‘final,’ does not take it outside the ambit [] of section 1008 . .
.”).) 
 
Berry also contends the October 3, 2023 order
is final, rather than interim, and cannot be reconsidered. (See Opp. at 3:24-4:10.)
Berry cites Marshall v. Webster (2020) 54 Cal.App.5th 275, 281, which
identified “the rule that section 1008 applies only to applications for interim
orders.” However, this statement is against the weight of authority and the
language of Section 1008. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1008 (e) (“This section
specifies the court's jurisdiction with regard to applications for
reconsideration of its orders and renewals of previous motions, and applies to
all applications to reconsider any order of a judge or court, or for the
renewal of a previous motion, whether the order deciding the previous matter or
motion is interim or final.”); Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th
674, 688 (“the 1992 amendment specified section 1008’s application to all orders,
final or interim . . .”); David S. Karton, a Law Corp. v. Musick, Peeler
Garrett LLP (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 1027, 1048 (“The statute is ‘exclusive
and jurisdictional’ and applies ‘to interim and final orders alike.’”) (quoting
Barthold, supra, 158 Cal.App.4th at 1313).) 
 
In opposition, Berry further argues Movants
lack standing because they are not parties within the meaning of Code of Civil
Procedure section 1008 and they are not properly connected to an application to
vacate a prefiling order. (Opp. at 4:11-6:2.) 
 
In Luckett
v. Panos (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 77, the Court of Appeal addressed the
procedure for vacating a prefiling order prior to the enactment of Code of
Civil Procedure section 391.8. The Court of Appeal declared Luckett a vexatious
litigant in In re Luckett (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 107 on its own motion.
Notably, and relevant to the parties’ arguments here, the Court of Appeal
solely provided notice to Luckett and not any of the litigants involved in the
underlying litigation. (In re Luckett, supra, 232 Cal.App.3d at 108 (“On
May 13, 1991, this court issued a written order and notice to Luckett, that it appeared he was a vexatious litigant
as defined by section 391, subdivision (b)(3), of the Code of Civil Procedure.”).)
Luckett filed an application to vacate the prefiling order in 2005 in a later
filed proceeding in the Orange County Superior Court. (Luckett, supra, 161 Cal.App.4th at 87.) The trial court denied the
request and Luckett appealed. In reviewing the order, the Court of Appeal found
Luckett must submit the application to vacate directly to the Court of Appeal Fourth
District, Division Three in case G011207 In re Luckett. (Id. at
96.) The Court of Appeal noted the party to the Orange County litigation in
which Luckett first filed the application to vacate was “not connected with the
request to erase the prefiling order,” and should be spared the need to incur
fees related to the application. (Id. at 96 n.17.) The history in Luckett
weighs against Movant’s arguments that they are entitled to notice or to
contest the Court’s October 3, 2023 order.
 
Berry further contends Movants are not
parties within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 1008. (Opp. at
5:6-6:2.) Code of Civil Procedure section 1008(a) permits “any party affected
by the order” to file a motion for reconsideration. In reply, Movants contend
they are affected by the October 3, 2023 order or the order “substantially
affects the[ir] interests [as] the adverse party.” (Reply at 5:14-6:28.)
However, a prefiling operates
prospectively to impose certain conditions upon a single litigant’s future
litigation. Accordingly, it does not appear that Movants are “affected by the
order” vacating the prefiling order as contemplated by Section 1008. 
 
Movants contend for the first time in reply
that the October 3, 2023 order is void ab initio. (Reply at 3:5-5:4.)
The argument is improper. (American Drug Stores, Inc. v. Stroh (1992) 10
Cal.App.4th 1446, 1453 (“Points raised for the first time in a reply brief will
ordinarily not be considered, because such consideration would deprive the
respondent of an opportunity to counter the argument.”).) Moreover, the
argument is based upon Movants’ asserted right to notice, which the Court does
not find persuasive as stated herein.
 
The Court Declines to Reconsider the
October 3, 2023 Order
 
Assuming Movants have standing to file a
motion for reconsideration, the motion is supported by the declarations of Soter
and Moxon, which satisfy Code of Civil Procedure section 1008(a). While Berry
contends the facts listed in the declarations are not new or different, (Opp.
at 6:13-28), some facts were not presented in connection with the application,
which would be sufficient here. (Even Zohar Construction & Remodeling,
Inc. v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 Cal.4th 830, 839 (“Courts have
construed section 1008 to require a party filing an application for
reconsideration or a renewed application to show diligence with a satisfactory
explanation for not having presented the new or different information earlier.”).)
 
Berry also argues only five alleged
misrepresentations and omissions are discussed in the Notice of Motion and
consideration should be limited to the five enumerated issues. (Opp. at 7:1-9.)
However, the case cited by Berry, Luri v. Greenwald (2003) 107
Cal.App.4th 1119, 1125, notes “[a]n omission in the notice may be overlooked if
the supporting papers make clear the grounds for the relief sought.” Movants
supporting papers clearly state the basis for relief.
 
Movants argue Berry’s application to vacate
included misrepresentations or incomplete facts warranting reconsideration.
(Mot. at 7:3-8:22; 14:14-21:5.) Movants contend Berry miscaptioned his
application and failed to serve Movants, and was therefore dishonest in his
filing. (Mot. at 14:14-15:6.) As noted above, the Court does not find Berry’s
conduct in this regard improper. Moreover, Berry’s conduct was not a result of dishonesty,
but rather his understanding, based upon legal research and communications with
court staff, of the vexatious litigant statutes and the requirements in seeking
relief. (Berry Decl. ¶¶ 14-16.) 
 
Movants contend Berry misrepresented that he only
filed one case in his personal name in the last twenty-four years. (Mot. at
15:16-18.) However, Movants cite a 2010 case filed by Moxon, not Berry, and
refer to the attempted filing of a cross-complaint. (Id. at 15:19-16:20.) Berry
noted the existence of this case in his application, (App. at 23 n.12), though
not the attempted filing of the cross-complaint. Movants next contend Berry
misrepresented the existence of sanctions ordered against him. (Mot. at 17:1-9.)
Movants cite two orders, dated September 13, 1999 and November 12, 1999, for
fees and costs arising from special motions to strike. (Ibid. See also Moxon
Decl. Ex. 18-19.) Movants further raised conduct related to State Bar proceedings
between 1999 and 2001. (Mot. at 17:10-18:5.) Berry contends the omissions were
due to lapses in memory, the sanctions being discharged in bankruptcy, the
closeness in time between the orders, and provides updated information. (Berry
Decl. ¶¶ 22-30.) The information, if provided at the time, would not warrant
denying the application. Furthermore, the Court is not inclined to reconsider
the October 3, 2023 order based upon the omission of conduct or events occurring
decades ago. 
 
Movants further contend Berry has not shown a
genuine effort at restitution, noting certain sanction awards were discharged
in bankruptcy and others were collected in the course of judgment debtor
proceedings. (Mot. at 18:6-19:16.) Berry’s initial application acknowledged a
portion of the sanctions were discharged in bankruptcy. (App. at 18:7-12.) Movants
do not identify any outstanding payable sanctions orders or restitution owed
for any current litigation. The Court is not persuaded reconsideration is warranted
on this basis.
 
Movants argue Berry has not shown any remorse
for their costs. (Mot. at 19:17-20:4.) However, Movants merely dispute this
fact, which is not a basis for reconsideration. Movants further contend Berry
“is entitled to no leniency because of his mental condition.” (Mot. at
20:5-21:5.) Berry’s initial application noted he was a heavy alcohol
drinker suffering from severe depression when he filed and litigated four
different cases against individuals and entities associated with the Church of
Scientology, but has been dry since April 25, 1999. Movants contend that substance
abuse or mental illness do not excuse attorney misconduct. However, it is
Berry’s asserted efforts at subsequent treatment, including foregoing alcohol
and the asserted use of medication, that are relevant and uncontested. 
 
The
Court is not persuaded to reconsider the October 3, 2023 order and finds
Movants failed to demonstrate the order should be altered. The evidence remains
sufficient to demonstrate “a material change in the facts upon which the order
was granted and that the ends of justice would be served by vacating the order.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 391.8(c).) 
 
The
motion for reconsideration is DENIED. 
 
Conclusion
 
The
Motion to Reconsider and Revoke the October 3, 2023 Order Removing Graham E.
Berry from the Judicial Council’s Vexatious Litigant List and Reinstate Graham
Berry to the Vexatious Litigant List is DENIED.
 
Berry shall give notice.
