And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court issues a preliminary injunction on the same terms as the temporary restraining order. The court finds that the balance of hardships favors the plaintiffs, and that they have demonstrated a sufficient probability of success on the merits. The court also finds that defendant acted in bad faith in erecting a rope fence across the driveway. The court orders the plaintiff to post an undertaking of $100,000 as a condition of the preliminary injunction. The court also finds that defendant's counsel's request for $850,000 in attorneys' fees is unreasonable and orders an undertaking of $100,000 for attorneys' fees.
