And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses two motions to compel further responses to requests for production of documents. The first motion is brought by Krikor Bardakjian against Mikayel Israyelyan, seeking to compel Israyelyan to produce his tax returns and other documents. The second motion is brought by Bardakjian against Liana Sahakyan, seeking to compel Sahakyan to produce her nursing degree and other documents.

The Court finds that Israyelyan's tax returns are exempt from disclosure as a matter of privilege, and therefore denies Bardakjian's motion to compel further responses. The Court also finds that Sahakyan's statement of inability to comply is sufficient and Bardakjian's has not shown good cause to compel further responses, and therefore denies Bardakjian's motion to compel further responses.

As for sanctions, the Court grants sanctions against Bardakjian and his counsel in the amount of $1,455 payable within 30 calendar days, as Bardakjian's motion was without substantial justification and was filed solely on his belief that Sahakyan defrauded the California Registered Nursing Board.
