And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied American Honda Motor Company and Galpin Motors, Inc.'s Motion for Summary Judgment. The Plaintiffs, Monico and Maria Ramirez, brought this action against the defendants in connection with an incident involving their 2003 Honda Accord, which they allege was defective and caused unintended acceleration, resulting in their injuries.

The Court found that Honda, the moving party, had not shown that there was no triable issue of material fact regarding the existence of a defect in the Subject Vehicle. The Court also found that Honda's initial burden had not been met, as they had not presented sufficient evidence to negate the essential element of causation present in each cause of action.

The Court noted that the Plaintiffs' supplemental responses to the interrogatories were not factually devoid, and that they had identified a component of the Subject Vehicle they believed was defective. The Court also rejected Honda's argument that there was a presumption of driver negligence working against the Plaintiffs, as it was inapplicable to this case.

As a result, the Court denied Honda's Motion for Summary Judgment and allowed the case to proceed to trial.
