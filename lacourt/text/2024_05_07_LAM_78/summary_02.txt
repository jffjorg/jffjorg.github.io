And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The court granted the plaintiff's motion to set aside the order denying summary judgment due to the plaintiff's counsel's mistake. The court denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second motion for summary judgment as unnecessary. The court noted that the plaintiff's counsel failed to attach evidence to the motion for summary judgment, which led to the denial of the motion. The court also pointed out that the plaintiff had sufficient time to file a second motion for summary judgment, but did not do so. The court emphasized the importance of granting relief to parties who have been unfairly affected by attorney mistakes.
