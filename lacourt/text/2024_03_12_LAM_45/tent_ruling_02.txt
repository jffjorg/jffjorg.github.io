Plaintiff
Francisco Javier Cervantes Manriquez filed this action on November 15, 2021,
alleging 15 causes of action for employment-related violations against

through 100. 
On
September 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant two motions to compel initial
discovery responses from Defendants. 
 
Discussion
1.
Motion to Compel Initial Responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission, Set
One, and Sanctions (Res. ID: 380121300226)
Plaintiff
moves for an order compelling Defendant Bonhomme to provide responses, without
objection, to Requests for Admission, Set One. This motion is unopposed.
Plaintiff
served Requests for Admission (Set One) on Bonhomme on April 1, 2022. (Schelly
Decl., ¶ 4.) Proof of service is attached to the Schelly Declaration as Exhibit
A. (Schelly Decl., Exh. A.) Bonhomme
failed to respond by the May 3, 2022 deadline. (Schelly Decl., ¶ 5.) 
A
party that has not received timely responses to requests for admission is
entitled to an order deeming the matters specified in the requests as admitted.
(CCP § 2033.280(b).) Here, Plaintiff has demonstrated that he properly served
requests for admission and that Bonhomme failed to timely respond. Therefore,
Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED. Bonhomme must provide responses without
objections to Plaintiff’s requests for admission, set one, within 20 days of
this order. 
Plaintiff
also requests $4,110.00 in sanctions against Defendant Bonhomme in connection
with the preparation and filing of this motion. Sanctions under section CCP § 2033.280(c)
are mandatory upon requesting party’s motion. The Court finds that Plaintiff is
entitled to sanctions but in a reduced amount. Plaintiff’s counsel’s rate is
$675. (Schelly Decl., ¶ 10.) Considering that there was no opposition, and the
simplicity of this motion, the Court finds that $500 is a reasonable amount of
sanctions. 
 
2.
Motion to Compel Initial Responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Production, Set
One, and Sanctions (Res. ID: 312664812393)
            Plaintiff moves for an order compelling Defendant Bonhomme
to provide responses, without objection, to Requests for Production (Set One).
This motion is unopposed. 
            Plaintiff
served Requests for Production (Set One) on Bonhomme on April 1, 2022. (Schelly
Decl., ¶ 4.) Proof of service is attached to
the Schelly Declaration as Exhibit A. (Schelly
Decl., Exh. A.) Bonhomme failed to respond by the May 3, 2022 deadline.
(Schelly Decl., ¶ 5.)
            A party that has not received timely responses to requests
for production is entitled to an order compelling responses without objections. (CCP
§ 2031.300.) Here, Plaintiff has demonstrated that he properly served requests
for production and that Bonhomme failed to timely respond. Therefore, Plaintiff’s
motion is GRANTED. Bonhomme must provide responses
without objections to Plaintiff’s requests for production, set one, within 20
days of this order.
            Plaintiff
also requests $4,110.00 in sanctions against Bonhomme in connection with the
preparation and filing of this motion. Under CCP § 2031.300(c),
sanctions shall be imposed against any party who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel, unless the Court finds that the responding party
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of a sanction unjust. Here, Bonhomme has not opposed this motion.
Additionally, sanctions were imposed against Bonhomme above for failure to
respond to Plaintiff’s requests for production, set one. Therefore, Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions in connection with filing the motion to compel responses
to requests for admission, set one, is DENIED. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel responses to requests for admission, set one, is GRANTED.
Bonhomme must provide responses without objections to Plaintiff’s requests for
admission, set one, within 20 days of this order. Additionally, sanctions are
granted against Bonhomme in the amount of $500.00, payable within 30 days.
            Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to request for
production of documents, set one, is GRANTED. Bonhomme
must provide responses without objections to Plaintiff’s requests for
production, set one, within 20 days of this order.
            
            It is so ordered.
