Motion for Interlocutory Judgment of Partition by Sale
and Appointment of Referee
 
            The court has considered the moving
papers. No opposition was received.
The court GRANTS the motion for interlocutory
judgment of partition by sale and appointment of referee. 
Background
            On August 29, 2022 Plaintiffs Suzanne M. Emerson and
Austin J. Cook (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this action against Defendant
Jeffrey L. Martin (“Martin”) for (1) partition (CCP § 872.230), (2) breach of
contract, (3) fraud, (4) conversion, and (5) theft (Penal Code § 496(c)). On
December 4, 2023, Plaintiffs substituted Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. for
Doe 1. 
            On November 6, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed the instant unopposed motion.
Legal
Standard
            The procedure of a partition actions is as follows:
(1) determine whether the plaintiff has an interest in the property sufficient
to maintain a partition action (CCP § 872.710); (2) determine whether the
plaintiff has waived their right to partition (CCP § 872.710(b)); (3) entry of
an interlocutory judgment of partition (CCP § 872.720(a)) and determination of
the manner of partition; (4) appointment of a referee to divide or sell the
property (CCP § 873.010(a)); (5) the referee sells the property (CCP §§ 873.670,
873.680); and (6) the referee delivers a report and the Court confirms the sale
(CCP §§ 873.710, 873.720(b), 873.730(a) and 873.790(a)).
Discussion
This is a
statutory action for the partition of real property filed pursuant to the
Uniform Partition of Heirs Property Act, CCP § 874.311 et seq., and Title 10.5
of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Under California law, “ordinarily, if
the party seeking partition is shown to be a tenant in common, and as such
entitled to the possession of the land sought to be partitioned, the right is
absolute.” (Bacon v. Wahrhaftig (1950) 97 Cal.App.2d 599, 603, quoting Priddel
v. Shankie (1945) 69 Cal.App.2d 319, 325. See also CCP § 872.710(b)
(“partition as to concurrent interests in the property shall be as of right”).)
Plaintiffs each have
a 33.33% interest in the property as a tenant in common with Defendant, who has
the other 33.33% interest in the property. (Emerson Decl., ¶4, Cook Decl., ¶4,
Exh. A.) The Simple Revocable Transfer on Death (TOD) Deed clearly states that
the three parties are tenants in common and Defendant has admitted the parties’
respective interests in his Answer. (Ibid.; see also 11/1/22 Answer.) Therefore,
the court finds that Plaintiffs have a sufficient interest in the property to
maintain a partition action. Additionally, there is no indication that Plaintiffs
have waived their right to partition the property, having simply owned the
property since receiving their interest in the property by way of inheritance.
The court does
not see any reason to not enter an interlocutory judgment of partition.
Defendant has not opposed the motion. Further, partition by sale would be the
best method by which to divide the property in this case, considering the
improvements upon the property and the fact that Defendant is occupying the
whole property.
Accordingly, the
court GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for interlocutory judgment of partition. As
requested by Plaintiffs, Stephen Bethel is appointed as referee for the sale of
the property.
 
 
            It
is so ordered.
