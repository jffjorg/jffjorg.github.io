Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiffs' Motion for Reconsideration of the January 8, 2024, ruling. The Plaintiffs sought reconsideration of the ruling, claiming that the Defendant's objections to their evidence were erroneously sustained, making their evidence inadmissible. However, the Judge finds that the Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that new or different circumstances warrant reconsideration of the earlier ruling. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiffs failed to properly lay the foundation and authenticate the exhibits they relied upon to oppose the Defendant's motion for summary judgment. As a result, the Plaintiffs' Motion for Reconsideration is denied.
