BACKGROUND
                
This is a lemon law action arising out of
Plaintiff’s purchase of a 2022 Genesis GV80, manufactured and distributed by
Defendant Hyundai Motor America.
 
ANALYSIS
 
The Song-Beverly Act provides, “[i]f
the buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed
by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate
amount of costs and expenses, including attorney's fees based on actual time
expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer
in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.” (Civ. Code
§ 1794(d).) 
 
Plaintiff asserts that the Law Offices
of Alex Cha & Associates incurred $12,845.00 in fees and $874.75 in costs
to prosecute this action. Plaintiffs request that the Court apply a 1.25
multiplier, for an additional $3,211.25 in fees. Plaintiffs seek $3,000.00 in
fees to bring and defend this motion.
 
1. Multiplier
 
Plaintiff requests that the Court apply
a 1.25 multiplier to counsel’s fees due to the novelty, difficulty, and skill
displayed in the case and the contingent nature of the case. The Court is
permitted, but not required, to apply a multiplier to an award for attorney’s fees
if, inter alia, there was contingent risk or exceptional skill displayed
by the attorneys. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1138.) In applying a multiplier for
contingent risk, “the trial court
should consider whether, and to what extent, the attorney and client have been
able to mitigate the risk of nonpayment…” (Id.) There is no evidence
that this case involved anything novel, nor did it require particular skill.
This is a standard lemon law action. There is no basis for a multiplier.
 
2. Lodestar
 
Plaintiff seeks $12,845.00 in fees to
prosecute this case. Plaintiff’s counsel charges between $350.00 and $500.00
per hour and spent 30.1 hours on this case over approximately one year.
Defendant argues that counsel’s fees are unreasonable, and counsel’s hourly
rates are excessive. The Court does not take issue with counsel’s hourly rates.
The Court also does not find counsel’s billing entries excessive. None of the
entries cited by Defendant are so egregious to warrant being reduced. The Court
finds counsel’s fees reasonable.
 
Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED in the
amount of $15,845.00 ($12,845.00+$3,000.00) in attorney fees and $874.75 in
costs.
