And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Acevedo v. Herrera, granting the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions. The plaintiff alleges that he was struck by the defendant's vehicle while riding a bicycle and has moved for terminating sanctions because the defendant failed to comply with discovery orders. Despite being granted a motion to compel responses and being allowed to defer the issue of sanctions, the defendant has still not responded to the discovery requests. The Judge finds that lesser sanctions will not be successful in compelling the defendant to respond and grants the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions in the amount of $700, payable within 30 days.
