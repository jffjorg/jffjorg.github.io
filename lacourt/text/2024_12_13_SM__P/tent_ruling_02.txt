Churchill Funding I, LLC v. 732
Indiana, LLC, Case no. 24SMCV03940
Hearing date December 13, 2024
Plaintiff’s
Demurrer to Defendant Ilan Kenig’s FACC
Plaintiff
Churchill Funding I, LLC sues defendants 728 Indiana, LLC, 732 Indiana, LLC,
Ilan Kenig, Los Angeles 104 Projects 2016 Limited Partnership and Marom Kislev
Projects 2016, LP for judicial foreclosure, breach of guarantee and injunctive
relief arising from defaulted real estate development loans guaranteed by real
property. Defendant Ilan Kenig, in pro per, cross-complained 9/6/24.
Kenig filed his FACC 9/9/24 alleging 12 COAs for breach of contract and
violations of the California Civil and Professions Codes. Plaintiff demurs to
the FACC and requests judicial notice. Kenig opposes.
Plaintiff’s Request for Judicial
Notice
Plaintiff
requests judicial notice of (1) the stipulation for entry of temporary
restraining order, filed on 8/28/24 in this action, and (2) the TRO entered
8/28/24 in this matter. Cal Evid. Code §452(d)(1) permits the court to take
judicial notice of any record of courts of California, another state or the
United States. Judicial notice of the court’s own records is proper. GRANTED.
Plaintiff’s Demurrer to the FACC
“The
function of a demurrer is to test the sufficiency of the complaint as a matter
of law.” Holiday Matinee, Inc. v. Rambus, Inc. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th
1413, 1420. A complaint “is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than
evidentiary facts,” Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531,
550, but plaintiff must allege essential facts “with reasonable precision and
with particularity sufficient to acquaint [the] defendant with the nature,
source and extent” of the plaintiff’s claim. Doheny Park Terrace Homeowners
Ass’n., Inc. v. Truck Ins. Exchange (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 1076, 1099.
Plaintiff
generally demurs to all 12 COAs on the grounds that Kenig lacks standing to
bring any of the claims asserted. Code Civ. Proc., §430.10(e); see also
Blumhorst v. Jewish Family Services of Los Angeles (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th
993, 1000 (“A litigant’s standing to sue is a threshold issue to be resolved
before the matter can be reached on the merits.”) Plaintiff argues the property
at issue is not owned by Kenig, and as such Kenig cannot show damages and has
no legal interest on which to base his claims. Kenig does not allege ownership
or interest in the property. FACC. Para. 12.
Kenig
alleges plaintiff has unlawfully violated the one-action rule under Cal. Code
Civ. Proc. §726 by pursuing both judicial and non-judicial foreclosure. Kenig
argues this allegation of unlawful action gives him standing. This argument is
unavailing. In the foreclosure context, an election of remedies only takes
place once the beneficiary under a deed of trust takes a judicial foreclosure
to judgment or completes a nonjudicial foreclosure by trustee’s sale because
the beneficiary effectively elects its remedy, thereby forfeiting the other. Flack
v. Boland (1938) 11 Cal.2d 103, 107. Plaintiff has not violated Cal. Code
Civ. Proc. §726, and as such Kenig lacks standing. 
Plaintiff
specifically demurs to the first and third COAs for wrongful foreclosure. Kenig
fails to allege ownership or interest in the property at issue. FACC para. 12.
Kenig has no grounds to bring claims for wrongful foreclosure. 
Plaintiff
specifically demurs to the second COA for unfair business practices. Kenig must
have suffered injury in fact and lost money or property. See Bus. &
Prof. Code, §17204. Kenig does not allege injuries or loss of money or
property. Kenig instead argues plaintiff’s actions have limited defendants’
ability to sell the property at issue. FACC para. 33. Kenig argues as guarantor
this constitutes an injury to him. This argument is unavailing. Kenig fails to
allege with sufficient particularity any invasion of legally protected
interests or concrete injuries. Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court (2011)
51 Cal.4th 310, 322-23.
Plaintiff
specifically demurs to the fourth COA for breach of contract. Kenig fails to
allege the necessary elements for breach of contract with sufficient
particularity. Kenig fails to attach a copy of the alleged contract, fails to
allege specific terms and conditions of the contract and fails to specify which
of plaintiff's actions constitute breach of contract. These are all necessary
elements of a breach of contract COA, without which a claim is insufficient.
See Bowden v. Robinson (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 705, 718.
Plaintiff
specifically demurs to the fifth, sixth and seventh COAs for injunction,
accounting and cancellation of instrument. Kenig lacks standing to assert the
alleged rights of the borrowers, as the FACC is brought in his individual
capacity and he is not an owner of the property. FACC para. 12 (“The above
referenced properties are owned managed and controlled by 728 Indiana LLC, a
California Limited Partnership and by 732 Indiana LLC.”), paras. 63, 65, 70,
81.
Plaintiff
specifically demurs to the eighth COA for abuse of process. “To establish a
cause of action for abuse of process, a plaintiff must plead two essential
elements: that the defendant (1) entertained an ulterior motive in using the
process and (2) committed a willful act in a wrongful manner.” Coleman v.
Gulf Ins. Group (1986) 41 Cal.3d 782, 792. Kenig asserts, on information
and belief, that plaintff does not intend on “completing the judicial
foreclosure but merely intends to expand the search for a legal remedy such as
the appointment of a receiver and then revert to the non-judicial foreclosure
to expedite the taking over the property.” FACC para. 88. Speculation is
insufficient, and the mere filing of a lawsuit even for an alleged improper
purpose is not a basis for an abuse of process COA. See, e.g., Kappel v.
Bartlett (1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1457, 1466.
Plaintiff
specifically demurs to the ninth COA for breach of the covenant of good faith
and fair dealing. Kenig fails to allege the contract at issue that gives rise
to the covenant. So far as Kenig seeks to assert a breach of plaintiff's
contract with borrower defendants, Kenig lacks standing as he is not a
borrower. FACC para. 92. Kenig fails to allege a basis for the ninth COA.
Plaintiff
specifically demurs to the tenth and eleventh COAs for fraud on the court.
Kenig fails to allege facts sufficient to support the COAs, fails to allege
fraud with specificity and complains of conduct protected by the litigation
privilege. See Civil Code, § 47; see also Bergstein v. Stroock &
Stroock & Lavan LLP (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 793, 814. Further, Kenig
asserts the fraud is evidenced by the entry of the 8/28/24 TRO; this is
unavailing as the TRO was entered by stipulation from the parties. Further, as
Kenig alleges conspiracy to commit fraud between plaintiff and plaintiff’s
counsel, Kenig is in violation of Cal. Civ. Code §1714.10 which requires leave
from the court to permit such a COA. 
Plaintiff
specifically demurs to the twelfth COA for breach of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code
§6068(d) (“It is the duty of an attorney to… never to seek to mislead the judge
or any judicial officer by an artifice or false statement of fact or law.”)
Kenig does not allege any facts showing that plaintiff’s purported statement is
a “false statements of fact or law.” Kenig fails to allege that plaintiff, as
an institution and not an attorney, is subject to Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §6068(d).
Kenig offers no authority providing for a private COA under Cal. Bus. & Prof.
Code §6068(d). 
Plaintiff’s
demurrer to Kenig’s FACC is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
