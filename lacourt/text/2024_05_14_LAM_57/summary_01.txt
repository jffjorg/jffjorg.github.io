And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the defendant's non-statutory motion for judgment on the pleadings will be continued to May 20, 2024. The Judge is inclined to continue the hearing to allow the parties to brief the issue of whether the principle of CCP Section 439(b) applies to non-statutory motions prior to the 1995 codification of motions for judgment on the pleadings, or has been applied to non-statutory motions since 1995. The defendant previously successfully moved for judgment on the pleadings on a portion of an earlier version of the complaint, and is now seeking judgment on the pleadings on grounds that could have been raised in the prior motion. The Judge notes that if the defendant's motion were statutory, it would be barred by CCP Section 439(b).
