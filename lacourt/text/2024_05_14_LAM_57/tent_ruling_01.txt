  Case Number:  21STCV42748    Hearing Date:   May 14, 2024    Dept:  57 Pending before the Court is the Defendants' non-statutory motion for judgment on the pleadings.   If  this were a statutory motion, it would be barred not just as untimely under CCP Section 438(e), but also under Section 439(b), which provides as follows: "A party moving for judgment on a pleading that has been amended after a motion for judgment on the pleadings on an earlier version of the pleadings was granted shall not move for judgment on any portion of the pleadings on grounds that could have been raised by a motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the earlier version of the pleading."  Section 439(b) would apply here if Defendants' motion were statutory because Defendants previously successfully moved for judgment on the pleadings on a portion of an earlier version of Plaintiff's complaint, which was amended after the motion was granted, but now Defendants are moving for judgment on the pleadings of portions of the amended complaint on grounds that could have been raised in the prior motion.  The Court is inclined to continue the hearing on the Defendants' non-statutory motion to May 20, 2024 so that the parties can brief whether the principle of Section 439(b) that bars motions for judgment on pleadings on grounds that could have been raised in a prior motion that was granted applied to non-statutory motions prior to the 1995 codification of motions for judgment on the pleadings, or has been applied to non-statutory motions since 1995.
