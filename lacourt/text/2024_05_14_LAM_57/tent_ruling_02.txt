 Case Number:  23STCV29078    Hearing Date:   May 14, 2024    Dept:  57 The Court is tentatively granting Plaintiff's unopposed motion to deem admitted matters set forth in Plaintiff's Request for Admissions to which Defendant failed to respond.  If Defendant submitted responses to the RFAs prior to the hearing on the motion that comply with the Code of Civil Procedure, then the Court will not deem the matters admitted, but will nevertheless impose monetary sanctions on Defendant for the attorney's fees Plaintiff incurred in connection with the motion because that sanction is mandatory for a failure to timely respond to RFAs.
