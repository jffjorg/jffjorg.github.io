And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) brought by Kaitlyn Anderson against EAN Holdings, LLC (erroneously sued as EAN Holdings LLC, d.b.a. Enterprise Rent-A-Car). The demurrer was brought by the defendant, who argued that the FAC is insufficiently alleged and that the Graves Amendment applies to this action and bars Plaintiff's claims against Defendant.

The judge agrees with the defendant that the FAC is insufficiently alleged, specifically with regards to the first cause of action for motor vehicle, which fails to allege that the defendant's negligence was a substantial factor in causing the harm. The judge also finds that the FAC fails to allege facts showing negligence or criminal wrongdoing attributed to the defendant.

The judge grants the defendant's request for judicial notice and sustains the demurrer to the FAC with leave to amend. The leave to amend is limited to curing the identified pleading defects and not to add new causes of action. The judge's ruling means that the plaintiff has 20 days to amend the FAC to address the defects identified by the judge.
