And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's ex parte application to advance the hearing on the motion to continue the trial. The motion to continue is granted due to the lack of opposition. The case has been plagued by discovery problems, including significant delays in obtaining the plaintiff's depositions, which required a court order. The plaintiff has recently filed a Doe Amendment, 13 months after the case was filed, adding Panorama Gardens Nursing and Rehab Center as a defendant. As a result, the court orders that the trial and FSC dates be vacated, and discovery, including expert designation, be reopened to the statutory time prior to the new trial date. The court also sets an OSC for sanctions against the plaintiff for failure to serve the new defendant, and sets new trial and FSC dates. Additionally, the court specifies that no further continuances will be allowed.
