BARRAGAN V FCA
[TENTATIVE]
ORDER:  Plaintiffs Yesenia Barragan and Jose G. Garcia’s Motion for
Attorneys’ Fees is GRANTED in Part and DENIED in Part.  The request for
attorneys’ fees in the amount of $33,981.00 is GRANTED.  The request for
the additional fees of $2,500.00 for reviewing the opposition, drafting the
reply brief, and attending the hearing on the motion is DENIED.
Introduction
Plaintiffs
Yesenia Barragan and Jose G. Garcia (Plaintiffs) moved for attorney’s fees
against Defendant FCA US LLC (Defendant).  (Civ. Code, § 1794, subd.
(d).)  Plaintiffs requested fees in the total amount of $36,481.00.
The
$36,481.00 in attorney’s fees includes: (1) Plaintiffs’ current fees in the
amount of $33,981.00; and (2) $2,500.00, which consists of the anticipated fees
for Plaintiffs’ counsel to review Defendant’s opposition, draft the reply
brief, and attend the hearing on the motion.
An
opposition from Defendant was due by December 26, 2024. As of January 6, 2025,
no opposition has been filed. Any opposition was required to have been filed
and served at least nine court days prior to the hearing. (Code Civ. Proc.,
sec. 1005, subd. (b).)
Discussion
There is no
dispute that Plaintiffs are the prevailing parties and thus entitled fees per
statute.
Statutory
attorney fees are ordinarily determined by the court pursuant to the “lodestar”
or “touchstone” method. However, the Court’s discretion is somewhat limited in
fee awards under the Song Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.  The statute
takes a different approach from customary statutory or contractual
provisions.  The statute requires an “initial determination of the actual
time expended; and then to ascertain whether under all the circumstances of the
case the amount of actual time expended and the monetary charge being made for
the time expended are reasonable.  These circumstances may include, but
are not limited to, factors such as the complexity of the case and procedural
demands, the skill exhibited and the results achieved. If the time expended or
the monetary charge being made for the time expended is not reasonable under
all the circumstances, then the court must take this into account and award
attorney fees in a lesser amount.”  (Robertson v. Fleetwood Travel
Trailers of California, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 785, 817.)  In the
situation of a contingency fee arrangement, the court in Nightingale stated,
“for purposes of section 1794, subdivision (d), a prevailing buyer represented
by counsel is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees for time
reasonably expended by his or her attorney.”  (Id. at p. 817-818 (citing
to Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 104-105, fn.
6.) 
Plaintiffs’
Counsel, Lara Rogers (Rogers), asserted that they took the case on a
contingency basis.  (Rogers Decl. par. 49.)  Because Rogers attested
to taking Plaintiffs’ case on a contingency basis, Plaintiff is entitled to
reasonable fees for the time reasonably expended.  Ms. Rogers charged
$325/hr. to $415/hr. between 2022 and 2024.  (Rogers Decl., par.
34.)  Plaintiffs incurred fees from four additional attorneys: Carey Wood
($450/hr. to $500/hr. from February 2022 through August 2022 and a four percent
increase as of January 4, 2024); Erik Whitman ($425/hr. to $475/hr. from June
2021 to February 2023), Bobby Walker ($400/hr. to $415/hr. between June 2023
and 2024), and Jessica Anvar ($515/hr. since June 2022). (Rogers Decl., pars.
32, 36, 37, 38.)  Plaintiffs also incurred fees from four paralegals:
Virgina Walls ($200/hr.), Jasmine Ochoa, Daisey Hernandez ($200/hr.), and
Elaine Astorga. (Rogers Decl., pars. 39-42.) 
The Court
notes that the declaration of Ms. Rogers does not set forth the hourly rates of
either Jasmine Ochoa or Elaine Astorga.  (Rogers Decl., pars. 40, 42.)
Moreover, the billing records do not reference any work done by Jasmine Ochoa.
(Rogers Decl., par. 47; exhs. 5 and 6.) Persons named Destiny Olvera and Isabel
Garcia—whom the Court assumes are paralegals given their billed rates of
$210/hr.—are reflected in the billing records. The Court is unsure whether
counsel used a declaration from another case which led to the misidentification
of the paralegals who worked on this action, or whether a mere typographical
error occurred. The Court further notes that the billing records reflect an
hourly rate of $210/hr. for Elaine Astorga and Virgina Walls. (Rogers Decl.,
par. 47; exh. 6.) Thus, the Court is unsure why counsel attested that Ms.
Walls’ hourly rate was “$200 per hour from November 20223 until her departure
in August 2024” even though the billing records reflect a rate of $210/hr.
(Rogers Decl., par. 39.)
Irrespective
of the inconsistences in identification and the conflict as to the hourly rate
of Ms. Walls, the Court does not have any evidence before it that the hours
spent, or hourly rates are unreasonable.  Defendant has failed to oppose
Plaintiffs’ motion which “may be deemed a consent to the granting of the
motion.” (Cal. R. Ct., rule 8.54(c).) The lack of a written opposition is a
waiver of the contentions raised in Plaintiffs’ motion.  (Moulton Niguel
Water Dist. v. Colombo (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1215 (“Contentions are
waived when a party fails to support them with reasoned argument and citations
to authority.”).)
Plaintiffs
were charged a total of 91.00 hours as recorded by all counsels and
paralegals.   (Rogers Decl. par. 47, Exh. 5,6.)  The Court finds
the amount of time charged and the hourly rates charged to be reasonable. 
The total amount of $33,981.00 in fees is seen to be reasonable and the Court
GRANTS Plaintiffs’ request for such fees.
Plaintiffs’
request for an additional $2,500.00 based upon the review of an opposition to
the motion, drafting a reply, and appearing at the hearing are unfounded. 
No such briefs have been filed.  Further, Plaintiffs’ requested fees
reviewed above are sufficient to cover the time expended at this hearing,
especially in light of the instant motion being unopposed.  The request
for an additional $2,500.00 is DENIED.
IT IS SO
ORDERED.  MOVING PARTY TO GIVE VERBATIM
NOTICE.
