And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the plaintiffs' first amended complaint (FAC) and has sustained the defendants' demurrer. The court finds that the FAC does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action because the cause of action for injunctive relief is uncertain and ambiguous. The court also finds that the FAC does not properly identify who is asserting the cause of action. However, the court grants the plaintiffs leave to amend their FAC and provides them with 15 days to do so.
