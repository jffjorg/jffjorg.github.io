Case
# 24STLC01744
 
Brian Mendelson
and Emily Kane (Defendants) demur to Robin Torres
and Al Torres’s (Plaintiffs) first amended complaint (FAC) as a whole. Defendants’
demurrer is sustained. Plaintiffs are granted leave to amend.
 
A.    Legal Standard
 
A demurrer is
sustained where “[t]he pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., 430.10, subd. (e).) “A demurrer tests the
legal sufficiency of the factual allegations in a complaint.” (Yalung v.
State (2023) 98 Cal.App.5th 71, 80.) In reviewing a complaint’s legal
sufficiency, a court will treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of law. (Esparza
v. Kaweah Delta Dist. Hospital (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 547, 552.) It is well
settled that a “demurrer lies only for defects appearing on the face of the
complaint[.]” (Stevens v. Superior Court
(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 594, 601.) “We not only treat the demurrer as admitting
all material facts properly pleaded, but also give the complaint a reasonable
interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.” (Guclimane Co. v. Stewart Tit. Guaranty Co.
(1998) 19 Cal.4th 26, 38.) For purposes of ruling on a demurrer, the complaint
must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the facts
pleaded. (Wilner v. Sunset Life Ins. Co.
(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 952, 958.)
 
When ruling
on a demurrer, a court may only consider the complaint’s allegations or matters
which may be judicially noticed. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d
311, 318.) The Court may not consider any other extrinsic evidence or judge the
credibility of the allegations pleaded or the difficulty a plaintiff may have
in proving his allegations. (Ion Equipment
Corporation v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881.) A demurrer is
properly sustained when the complaint, liberally construed, fails to state
facts sufficient to constitute any cause of action. (Kramer v. Intuit Inc. (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 574, 578.) Demurrer is
also appropriate where the pleading is uncertain, ambiguous, or unintelligible.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (f).)
 
When a
demurrer is sustained, the Court determines whether there is a reasonable
possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment. (Blank, supra,
39 Cal.3d at p. 318).  When a plaintiff “has pleaded the general set of
facts upon which his cause of action is based,” the court should give the
plaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint, since plaintiff should not “be
deprived of his right to maintain his action on the ground that his pleadings
were defective for lack of particulars.” (Reed v. Norman (1957) 152
Cal.App.2d 892, 900.) The Court may grant leave to amend an answer so long as
there is no prejudice to the plaintiff. (Hong Sang Market, Inc. v. Peng
(2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 474, 488.)
 
B.     Discussion
 
Defendants demur to
Plaintiffs’ FAC on multiple grounds. First, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’
FAC fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action because the
FAC does not comply with the California Rules of Court, rule 2.112(3). (Code
Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).) Second, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs’
FAC is uncertain because it fails to allege a proper cause of action. (Id.
§ 430.10, subd. (f).) The Court will address each argument in turn.
 
Plaintiffs’
FAC properly identifies which Plaintiffs are bringing the cause of action against
Defendants.
 
Defendants argue that
demurrer is appropriate because Plaintiffs have failed to comply with the Rules
of Court. Specifically, each separately stated cause of action must state “[t]he
party asserting it if more than one party is represented on the pleading.”
(Rules of Court, rule 2.112(3).) 
 
Here, Plaintiffs
allege a single cause of action for injunctive relief regarding the enforcement
of an equitable servitude. Above the sole cause of action, the FAC states that
“Plaintiffs Robin Torres and Albert Torres (“Plaintiffs”) allege as follows.”
(FAC p. 1.) Thus, Plaintiffs identify that both parties to the pleading are
asserting the cause of action against Defendants. Accordingly, the Court does
not sustain Defendants’ demurrer on this basis. 
 
Plaintiffs’ FAC is
uncertain.
 
Defendants argue that
Plaintiffs’ FAC is subject to demurrer for uncertainty. (Code Civ. Proc., §
430.10, subd. (f).) Specifically, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs fail to allege
a cause of action and identify who is asserting any cause of action. As
discussed above, Plaintiffs have properly identified who is asserting their
cause of action for injunctive relief. 
 
However, Plaintiffs’
alleged cause of action is improper. Indeed, “[i]njunctive relief is a remedy,
not a cause of action.” (City of South Pasadena v. Department of
Transportation (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1280, 1293.) Plaintiffs’ stated cause
of action is “Injunctive Relief (Breach and Enforcement of Equitable Servitude
Pursuant to Recorded CC&Rs).” Plaintiffs do reference Civil Code section 5975
in their purported cause of action, which provides that “covenants and
restrictions in the declaration shall be enforceable equitable servitudes,
unless unreasonable, and shall inure to the benefit of and bind all owners of
separate interests in the development.” But this reference is insufficient to
properly appraise Defendants of the claims against them when the named cause of
action itself is ambiguous. Thus, Plaintiffs’ cause of action for injunctive
relief, as pled, is uncertain. Accordingly, the Court sustains Defendants’
demurrer.
 
Given Plaintiffs’
reference to the Civil Code and factual allegations within their FAC, the Court
finds that there is a reasonable probability that Plaintiffs’ defect may be
cured with amendment. Accordingly, the Court grants Plaintiffs leave to amend
their FAC.
 
The Court sustains
Defendants’ demurrer with 15 days leave to amend..
