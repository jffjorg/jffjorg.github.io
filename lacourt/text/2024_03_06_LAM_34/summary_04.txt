```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling states that the Plaintiff's Second Motion for Change of Venue is taken off calendar. The Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the motion because the Amended Complaint has been dismissed and the Court sustained the Demurrers to it. The Court previously denied the Plaintiff's original Motion for Change of Venue without prejudice because it did not include proof of service. The Plaintiff's Second Motion for Change of Venue is directly related to the current pleading and is not included among the exceptions to the rule that any act of the Court would be void. The Court can only take the motion off calendar, which is a postponement, not a dismissal.
