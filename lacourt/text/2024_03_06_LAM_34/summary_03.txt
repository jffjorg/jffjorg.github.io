The Judge's tentative ruling takes the Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint off the calendar. The motion was previously heard and granted, but the moving party (Plaintiff Brian Williams) failed to remove it from the calendar. The complaint was initially filed on January 18, 2022, and was amended once before the motion was filed. The Judge concludes that the motion is no longer necessary and is taken off the calendar.
