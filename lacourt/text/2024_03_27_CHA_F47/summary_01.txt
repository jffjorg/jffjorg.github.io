And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel further responses from the plaintiff to their Request for Production of Documents, Set 1. The plaintiff is ordered to provide further, verified responses within 30 days. The defendant requested an award of sanctions against the plaintiff and her counsel in the amount of $1,815.00, but the judge denied this request due to the lack of clear identification of the attorney against whom the sanction is sought. The plaintiff's responses to the requests were deemed defective and failed to comply with California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) rules.
