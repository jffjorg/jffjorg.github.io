Legal Standard Section 483.010 provides that “an attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims for money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where the total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable amount not less than five hundred dollars ($500) exclusive of costs, interest, and attorney's fees.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 483.010, subd. (a).) “If the action is against a defendant who is a natural person, an attachment may be issued only on a claim which arises out of the conduct by the defendant of a trade, business, or profession.” (Id., subd. (c).)Under Code of Civil Procedure section 484.090(a), a court shall issue a right to attach order if it finds that: (1) The claim upon which the attachment is based is one upon which an attachment may be issued. (2) The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim upon which the attachment is based. (3) The attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based. (4) The amount to be secured by the attachment is greater than zero. The burden is on the moving party to establish these elements. (Loeb & Loeb v. Beverly Glen Music, Inc. (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 1110, 1116.)  “A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant on that claim.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 481.190.) “In determining the probable validity of a claim where the defendant makes an appearance, the court must consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective parties and make a determination of the probable outcome of the litigation.”¿(Loeb & Loeb v. Beverly Glen Music, Inc. (1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 1110, 1120.)  The court does not determine whether the claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial and is not affected by the decision on the application for the order. (CCP §484.050(b).)B. Analysis 1. BackgroundOn June 8, 2023, this court heard Plaintiff’s first motion for a writ of attachment, to which Defendants did not file an opposition. The Court granted the right to attach, and various right to attach orders were issued.On September 5, 2023, the parties jointly stipulated to set aside the right to attach order. (See 09/05/23 Stipulation.) Plaintiff now brings this second motion for a right to attach. Defendants have opposed, and individual Defendant Vershinin filed a claim of exemption.2. Moving Party’s Argument and EvidencePlaintiff moves for a writ of attachment. Plaintiff brought this action to recover payments due for petroleum products Plaintiff provided Defendants. The principal amount owed for these products (as of the filing date of the Complaint) is $9,014,940.08 by Defendant REI, $7,135,645.15 by Defendant RED, $3,920,509.50 by Defendant SRG, $681,774.82 by Defendant SPI, and $20,752,849.55 by Defendant Vershinin.  (Lee Declaration ¶¶ 8-11.)Plaintiff alleges Defendant Vershinin executed various “Customer Application Forms” to enable Defendants to procure petroleum products from Plaintiff. (Compl. ¶ 19.) Vershinin also executed personal guaranties on each contract. (Id. ¶ 23.) Consistent with the contracts, Plaintiff alleges it fulfilled orders for petroleum products, arranged delivery of the products to Defendants’ gas stations, and issued invoices for payments. (Id. ¶ 25.) Defendants have allegedly failed to make payments for the products delivered and invoiced. To prevail on a breach of contract claim, Plaintiff must establish “(1) the existence of the contract, (2) plaintiff's performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant's breach, and (4) the resulting damages to the plaintiff.” (D'Arrigo Bros. of California v. United Farmworkers of Am. (2014) 224 Cal. App. 4th 790, 800.)In support of the motion, Plaintiff presents a declaration from it’s a Controller in the Finance Department, Jaehee Lee. Lee provides the “Customer Application Forms” by which the entity Defendants applied for extensions of credit. (Lee Decl. Exhs. A, B, C, D.) As to Defendant SRG, Plaintiff represents that at least 118 invoices have not been paid. (Lee Decl. ¶ 8, Exh. E.) The aggregate amount owed on these SRG invoices is at least $3,452,768.78. The interest charges accrued on that amount, as of April 6, 2023, is at least $467,740.72 in aggregate. (Id.)As to Defendant RED, Plaintiff represents that at least 206 invoices remain unpaid, in the aggregate amount of at least $6,300,827.65, plus at least $834,767.50 in interest. (Lee Decl. ¶ 9; Exh. F.)As to Defendant SPI, Plaintiff represents that at least 27 invoices remain unpaid, in the aggregate amount of at least $596,921.05, plus interest of at least $84,553.77. (Lee Decl. ¶ 10; Exh. G.) Finally, as to Defendant REI, Plaintiff represents that at least 283 invoices remain unpaid, in the aggregate amount of at least $8,232,734.12, plus interest of at least $781,255.96. (Lee Decl. ¶ 11; Exh. H.)3. Opposing Parties’ Arguments and EvidenceDefendants oppose the attachment. First, Defendants contend that Plaintiff failed to comply with the Code requirements because it has not provided an express or implied contract entitling it to the attachment. Relatedly, Defendants argue Plaintiff has failed to establish the amount to attach is readily ascertainable. Defendants then argue that Plaintiff cannot establish the probable validity of its claims. Defendants dispute that Plaintiff actually delivered the products as reflected in the invoices. (See Vershinin Decl. ¶¶ 5-8.) Finally, Defendants contend the attachment is sought for an improper purpose, namely, to force Defendants into an “unfair” settlement. (Opp. 11: 25.) 4. ResolutionFirst, the claim upon which the attachment is based is one upon which an attachment may be issued. There is nothing to suggest the purpose is for something other than the recovery of the claim upon which the attachment is based. Also, the amount to be secured by the attachment is greater than zero. Second, there is no merit to Defendants’ argument that Plaintiff has failed to provide a contractual basis for the amounts sought in the action. To the contrary, Plaintiff provided applications, invoices, and bills of lading, which evince mutual assent for the sale and purchase of the petroleum products at issue. Plaintiff has also established the basis for the calculation of the amounts owed based on the amount of fuel provided. Beyond conclusory allegations to the contrary, Defendants have failed to satisfactorily dispute these amounts. Therefore, Plaintiff has established the existence of contracts between Plaintiff and Defendants which provide for reasonably ascertainable damages.Thus, the main issue is whether Plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim upon which the attachment is based. Here, Plaintiff’s accompanying account applications, invoices, bills of lading, and the declaration confirming sales of the product, under contract, demonstrate the probable validity of Glovis’s claims. (Lee Decl. ¶¶ 3-11, Exs. A-L.) Beyond conclusory assertions, Defendants have failed to provide competent evidence disputing the delivery of petroleum products and have failed to rebut Plaintiff’s calculation of the amounts due and owing. As the party who received (or purportedly did not receive) the deliveries, Defendants are in position to know what was or was not delivered. By failing to provide satisfactory evidence, Defendants cannot meet their burden to establish the defense. Therefore, considering the relative merits, Plaintiff has sufficiently demonstrated “it is more probable than not” that it will prevail on its breach of contract claim(s). Plaintiff is therefore entitled to the attachment.Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Application is GRANTED. The order and writ are issued against Defendant REI in the amount of $9,014,940.08, against Defendant RED in the amount of $7,135,645.15, against Defendant SRG in the amount of $3,920,509.50, against Defendant SPI in the amount of $681,774.82, and against Defendant Vershinin in the amount of $20,752,849.55.Plaintiff is ordered to file an undertaking in the amount of $10,000.Claim of ExemptionDefendant Sergey Vershinin filed a separate claim of exemption. Vershinin objects to the amount sought to be secured and moves for an exemption from attachment of certain real property. (See Claim of Exemption, 4(c)(1).) Vershinin also moves to exempt property contained in “[d]eposit accounts at Wells Fargo, Chase, US Bank, and/or Citibank” necessary to support him or his family, or which are otherwise not subject to attachment under CCP 487.010. (Id. 4(c)(2).) A claim of exemption “shall be accompanied by an affidavit supporting any factual issues raised by the claim and points and authorities supporting any legal issues raised.” (CCP § 484.070.) Defendant Vershinin provided a declaration only with his opposition to the right to attach. (See Vershinin 09/26/23 Decl.) That declaration does not address the subject properties or deposit accounts which he seeks to exempt, much less establish they qualify for exemptions under CCP section 703.010 et. seq., section 487.010, or section 703.530.Accordingly, Defendant’s claim of exemption is DENIED at this time.Moving party to give notice.IT IS SO ORDERED.Dated:  October 3, 2023 ___________________________________ Randolph M.
