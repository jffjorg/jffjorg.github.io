English text:
The tentative ruling is for the Plaintiff's Motion for Right to Attach, granted in the amount of $10,000. Defendant Vershinin's claim of exemption is denied. The Judge found that the claim upon which the attachment is based is one upon which an attachment may be issued, and Plaintiff has established the probable validity of the claim upon which the attachment is based. Plaintiff has established the existence of contracts between Plaintiff and Defendants which provide for reasonably ascertainable damages. Defendant Vershinin failed to provide satisfactory evidence disputing the delivery of petroleum products and rebutting Plaintiffโs calculation of the amounts due and owing.
