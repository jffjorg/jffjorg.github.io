And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Defendant Jeff Lotman's motion for summary judgment. The motion was made to dismiss Plaintiff JD Classics Limited's (in administration) claims against Lotman, alleging fraud, aiding and abetting fraud, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, and negligent misrepresentation.

The court found that there are triable issues of material fact as to the statute of limitations, specifically whether Lotman's alleged fraud should have placed Plaintiff on inquiry notice by October 20, 2017. The court noted that while PwC, JDCL's auditor, did not discover the alleged fraud for three years, it is unclear whether Plaintiff should have discovered the fraud earlier. The court also found that the lack of formalized documentation in the Lotman deals would not necessarily raise a clear red flag.

Furthermore, the court noted that there is evidence that Hood, JDCL's former CEO, maintained nearly exclusive control of JDCL's financial books and records until he was suspended in June 2018. This raises a disputed question of material fact as to whether the adverse-dominion doctrine applies, which would toll the statute of limitations during Hood's control of JDCL.

The court concluded that, considering the evidence, it cannot find that the undisputed evidence establishes Plaintiff's claim is untimely. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment is denied.

English text:
This tentative ruling relates to case number 21STCV14556, with a hearing date of October 3, 2023, in Dept 49. The Judge denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment in this dispute between JD Classics Limited (in administration) and Jeff Lotman.

JD Classics Limited alleges that its former CEO, Derek Hood, and the defendant, Jeff Lotman, formed a scheme to misrepresent the company's financial information, causing the company's accounting and financial records to be materially misstated. This led to the eventual sale of JD Classics Limited. The plaintiff brings causes of action against Lotman for fraud, aiding and abetting fraud, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, and negligent misrepresentation.

The defendant moves for summary judgment, which the court denies. The court takes judicial notice of exhibits 1 and 2, and overrules most of the objections to evidence presented by both parties. The court applies a three-step analysis in analyzing motions for summary judgment and determines that there are triable, material factual issues.

The central dispute in this motion is whether the plaintiff's claims are time-barred under a three-year statute of limitations. The defendant argues that the limitations period began running in 2016, 2017, or January 2018. However, the plaintiff asserts that the "adverse domination doctrine" prevents the statute of limitations from running while Hood, an alleged player in the fraud, controlled JD Classics Limited. The court agrees with the plaintiff and applies Emergency Rule 9, which tolled the statute of limitations from April 6, 2020, to October 1, 2020.

The court concludes that the undisputed evidence does not establish that the plaintiff's claim is untimely. Therefore, the defendant's motion for summary judgment is denied.
