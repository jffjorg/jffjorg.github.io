Summary:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The motion was filed by Jeff Lotman, who is accused of aiding and abetting fraud, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, and negligent misrepresentation by the plaintiff, JD Classics Limited (in administration). The plaintiff alleges that Lotman and the founder of JDCL, Derek Hood, formed a scheme to misrepresent JDCL's financial information to facilitate a sale of the company. The defendant argues that the plaintiff's claims are time-barred, citing a three-year statute of limitations. The court finds that there are triable issues of material fact as to the statute of limitations and the application of the adverse-dominion doctrine. Therefore, the motion is denied.
