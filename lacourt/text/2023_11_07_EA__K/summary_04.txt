The judge has considered the opposition filed by the plaintiff despite its untimely filing and service. Although the opposition was due on October 25, 2023, and was filed and served on October 27, 2023, the judge has chosen to consider the substance of the opposition, citing an email communication between counsel in which the defendant's counsel agreed to accept the plaintiff's untimely filing and service. The judge admonishes counsel for the untimely filing and cautions him that any future untimely filings may not be considered by the court. The judge also references Probate Code sections 9000 and 9103, which define a "claim" and provide for the filing of claims after expiration of the time for filing, respectively.
