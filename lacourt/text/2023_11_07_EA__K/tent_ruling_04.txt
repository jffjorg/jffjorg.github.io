[1]              Plaintiff’s opposition is untimely
(due October 25, 2023, filed and electronically served October 27, 2023). The
court has elected to consider the substance of the opposition, particularly
since counsel has provided the court with a copy of an October 25, 2023 email
communication between counsel wherein Defendant’s counsel agreed to accept
Plaintiff’s untimely filing and service of the opposition. The court admonishes
counsel for the untimely filing and cautions him that any future untimely
filings may not be considered by the court.
