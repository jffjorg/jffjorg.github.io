Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
Plaintiff seeks $1,278.61 in attorney’s
fees. Attorney Christopher Mandarich (“Mandarich”) attests that Plaintiff seeks
attorney’s fees pursuant to Civil Code 1717; however, Mandarich fails to
identify any contractual attorney’s fees provision here. Plaintiff’s complaint
reflects that attorney’s fees are being sought pursuant to Plaintiff’s second
cause of action for Open Book Account. (See Complaint, ¶ 27). Civil Code §
1717.5 generally applies to attorney’s fees in any action on a contract based
on a book account. Plaintiff is requested to either brief the issue of
attorney’s fees or recalculate said fees in the amount of $1,200.00 pursuant to
Civil Code § 1717.5 and lodge a new proposed judgment.
