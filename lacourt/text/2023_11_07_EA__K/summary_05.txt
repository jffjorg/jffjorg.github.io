The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's Application for Default Judgment without prejudice. The Plaintiff, Absolute Resolutions Investments, LLC, had sought to recover $1,278.61 in attorney's fees, but the Judge found that the Plaintiff failed to identify a contractual attorney's fees provision in the complaint. The Judge has instead asked the Plaintiff to either brief the issue of attorney's fees or recalculate the fees in the amount of $1,200.00, as allowed by Civil Code 1717.5. The case is set for a Case Management Conference and an Order to Show Cause on November 7, 2023.
