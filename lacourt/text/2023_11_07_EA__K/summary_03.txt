Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by Susan Copenhaver, as Administrator of the Estate of Jeffrey L. Albrecht, in favor of the estate. The court finds that the complaint filed by Sally Mack fails to state a cause of action against the estate because it does not allege that a claim was filed and rejected prior to filing the complaint, as required by Probate Code § 9351. Additionally, the court finds that Plaintiff failed to file a timely creditor's claim and did not petition the court to file a late claim, as required by Probate Code § 9100. The court also finds that the complaint does not name the proper party, as the "estate" is not a legal entity that can be sued. The court grants the motion on all four grounds.
