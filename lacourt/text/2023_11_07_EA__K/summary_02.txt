**Significant Statements**
```
Le's demurrer references numerous alleged facts which are extrinsic to the face of Plaintiff's complaint and thus improper for consideration on demurrer.
Plaintiff has alleged that the hostile claim was asserted on March 2, 2023 when Plaintiff received notice of Wang's claim to the subject property.
A resulting trust is not a cause of action, but a remedy.
A cause of action for quiet title requires (1) a legal description and street address of the subject property; (2) the title of the plaintiff as to which a determination is sought and the basis of the title; (3) the adverse claims to the title of the plaintiff against which a determination is sought; (4) the date as of which the determination is sought and (5) a prayer for the determination of the title of the plaintiff against the adverse claims.
