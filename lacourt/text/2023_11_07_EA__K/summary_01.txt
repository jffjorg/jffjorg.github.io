The court grants Junqin Liu's counsel, Ecoff Campaign Tilles & Kay, LLP, motion to be relieved as counsel. The motion is granted effective upon the filing of proof of service showing service of the signed order upon Junqin Liu at his last known address. The court finds that the requirements of California Rule of Court Rule 3.1362 have been met, including notice to Junqin Liu, a declaration stating the reasons for the motion, service of the motion papers and declaration, and a proposed order relieving counsel. The court also finds that the breakdown of the attorney-client relationship has caused a complete breakdown of communication between counsel and client, and that Junqin Liu has failed to honor the payment obligation under the attorney-fee agreement.
