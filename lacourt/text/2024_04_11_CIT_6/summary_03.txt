The court finds that the plaintiff's damages request does not clearly add up to the amount sought, and that the supporting documents are incomplete and unclear. Specifically, the court notes that the medical bills and vehicle repair documents are incomplete and difficult to read. As a result, the court has denied the plaintiff's request for default judgment without prejudice.
