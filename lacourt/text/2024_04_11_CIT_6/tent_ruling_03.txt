 Case Number:  23PSCV02825    Hearing Date:   April 11, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff  California Casualty Indemnity Exchange’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment  Defendant: Michael Harrison  COURT’S RULING             Plaintiff’s  request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.            BACKGROUND                        This  is an insurance subrogation action arising out of an auto accident. On  September 13, 2023, plaintiff California Casualty Indemnity Exchange  (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Michael Harrison (Defendant)  and Does 1 through 100, alleging two causes of action for subrogation claim and  indebtedness.            LEGAL  STANDARD  Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court Judgment,  and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other admissible  evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest computations as  necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a proposed form of  judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment is not sought or  an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579,  supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7) exhibits as necessary;  and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement  of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)  ANALYSIS Plaintiff  seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $42,385.45,  including $41,835.00 in damages, $0.00 in interest, $0.00 in attorney fees, and  $550.45 in costs. The Court finds a few issues with Plaintiff’s default  judgment package. First, the documents submitted in support of the damages  request do not clearly add up to the amount Plaintiff seeks. Plaintiff claims  $29,200.00 in uninsured medical benefits, but provided no medical bills or  proof of payment of such bills. (See Webb Decl., ¶ 9, Exs. 1-3.) The vehicle  repair documents appear to be comprised largely, if not solely, of estimates  for repairs rather than payment receipts. (See Id.) Also, while Exhibit  3 might possibly provide some of the missing information, it is hard to read,  as much of the numbers’ portion of that exhibit is very faint. (See Id.,  Ex. 3.)  CONCLUSION                        Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request  for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
