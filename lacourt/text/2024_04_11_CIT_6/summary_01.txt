And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The motion for leave to amend the cross-complaint is denied. The proposed amendments would add new causes of action for false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The Court finds that these causes of action are independent from the existing claims and would be time-barred by the statute of limitations. The amendment would also prejudice Cross-Defendants, who have already completed their discovery and are ready to set a trial date. The Court concludes that the motion is not well-taken.
