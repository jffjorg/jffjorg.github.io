And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendant's motion for attorney's fees. The plaintiff, Gabriela Cabrera, brought a lawsuit against the defendant, Bost Land, LLC, alleging violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act. The defendant prevailed in a bench trial in December 2023. The defendant sought attorney's fees for defending against what it claimed were frivolous, unreasonable, and without foundation claims. The plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing that the defendant was not entitled to recover attorney's fees because the plaintiff's claims were not frivolous and the defendant did not prevail in the lawsuit. The judge agreed with the plaintiff and denied the defendant's motion for attorney's fees.
