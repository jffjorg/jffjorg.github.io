Li COURT RULING     Plaintiff’s request for entry of  default judgment is GRANTED. The Court will sign the proposed judgment.  BACKGROUND            This  is a collection case. On November 17, 2023, plaintiff L.A. Commercial Group,  Inc. (Plaintiff), assignee of National Ready Mixed Concrete Company for  purposes of collection, filed this action against defendants U.S. Noah  Technology Corp., Ji K. Li (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1 to 10,  alleging causes of action for common counts and breach of contract.             On  January 19, 2024, default was entered against Defendants. Plaintiff also  submitted a request for entry of default judgment. On January 19, 2024, the  Court rejected the request for entry of default judgment. On February 7, 2024,  Plaintiff resubmitted the request for entry of default judgment.           LEGAL  STANDARDCode of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a  proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment  is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil  Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7)  exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by  statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1800.) ANALYSISPlaintiff  seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $35,243.16,  including $35,075.65 in damages less a credit acknowledgment of $5,000.00, $3,328.96  in interest, $1,200.00 in attorney fees, and $638.55 in costs. Because the  Court finds the request for entry of default judgment to be properly supported  by the evidence, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for entry of default  judgment in the amount of $35,243.16. CONCLUSION              Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment is GRANTED. The Court will sign the proposed judgment.
