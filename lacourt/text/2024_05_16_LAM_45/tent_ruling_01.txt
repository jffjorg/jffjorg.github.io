Background
            Rexford
Industrial – 701 Kingshill, LLC (Plaintiff) is the owner and lessor of 16830
Avalon Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90746. On February 5, 2010, Plaintiff entered
into a lease with AutoCom, Inc. (Defendant) as lessee. Plaintiff alleges that
after the last made payment in March of 2020, AutoCom breached the lease.             
            The
motions now before the Court are:
1.       Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Responses to Plaintiff’s Demand for Production of Documents
and Request for Monetary Sanctions in the Amount of $1,810.00
2.       Plaintiff’s
Motion to Compel Responses to Interrogatories and Request for Monetary
Sanctions in the Amount of $1,810.00
3.      Plaintiff’s Motion to Have Matters in Plaintiff’s
Requests for Admissions Deemed Admitted and Request for Monetary Sanctions in
the Amount of $1,810.00 (hereinafter, the Motions)
            No
opposition has been filed; therefore, the motions remain unopposed. 
 
Discussion
 
Legal
Standard for Motion to Compel Responses to Request for Production
            “If a party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely
response to it, the following rules shall apply: (a) The party to whom the
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any
objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product under Chapter 4…(b) The party making the demand may move for
an order compelling response to the demand. (c) Except as provided in
subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code Civ. Proc., §2031.300)
            
            Legal Standard for Motion to Compel
Responses to Interrogatories
            If a party to whom interrogatories
are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move
for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (Code Civ.
Proc., §2030.290, subds. (b), (c).) Failure to timely respond waives all
objections, including privilege and work product, unless “[t]he party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance” and “[t]he
party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., §2030.290, subds.
(a)(1), (a)(2).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel
where no responses have been served and no meet and confer is required when a
party does not respond to discovery requests. All that need be shown in the
moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the
opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of
any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d
902, 905-906.)
 
            Legal Standard for Motion to Deem
Requests for Admissions Admitted
            Code of Civil Procedure § 2033.250,
provides, in pertinent part, that “[w]ithin 30 days after service of the
request for admissions . . . the party to whom the requests are directed shall
serve the original of the response to them on the requesting party.” A motion
to deem admitted requests for admissions lies based upon a showing of failure
to respond timely. (Code Civ. Proc., §2033.280(b); Demyer v. Costa Mesa
Mobile Home Estates (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 393, 395, disapproved on other
grounds by Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 983.) Requests
for admissions must be deemed admitted where no responses in substantial
compliance was served before the hearing. (CCP §2033.280(c).) As to motions to
deem matters admitted, no meet and confer is required. (Demyer v. Costa Mesa
Mobile Home Estates (1995) 36 Cal. App. 4th 393, 395, overruled on other
grounds by Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal. 4th 973, 983. Also see Leach
v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 904–906, 169 Cal.Rptr. 42 [rejecting
argument that state rule of court requiring informal meet and confer applied to
motion where no response at all had been made to interrogatory requests,
reasoning that because objections had been waived for failure to timely answer,
there was “nothing to ‘resolve’ with the meaning” of the rule)].) 
 
            Analysis
            Plaintiff
provides the Declaration of Jason J. Stillman (Stillman Decl.) for all three
Motions. The Stillman Decl. states that on June 15, 2023, Plaintiff served all
three discovery requests on Defendant. After a three-week extension was granted
on July 11, 2023, to Defense counsel, H. Jack Kakoaian, Matt Cortez substituted
as counsel for Defendant. (Stillman Decl., ¶¶3-4.) Mr. Cortez then requested
and was granted a further 30-day extension on August 23, 2023. (Stillman Decl.,
¶5.) On November 9, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel contacted Mr. Cortez to inquire
as to the status of the discovery responses, however, Plaintiff’s counsel only
received a response on December 5, 2023, in which Mr. Cortez communicated that
he had lost contact with his client. (Stillman Decl., ¶7.) As of January 24,
2024, no responses had been received for any of the discovery requests.
(Stillman Decl., ¶8.) Plaintiff then filed the instant Motions. As such the
Motions are granted and sanctions are warranted.        
            Sanctions
- 
            Plaintiff’s
counsel provides the following calculations:
·        
Counsel’s hourly rate is $350.00
·        
Counsel spent 1 hour preparing each
Motion
·        
Counsel anticipated spending 3
hours reviewing opposition papers, preparing for and attending the hearing. 
·        
Counsel incurred a $60.00 filing
fee. 
Considering the similarities between the
Motions, that Defense counsel cannot make contact with their client, and that
no opposition was filed, the Court will impose sanctions on Defendant, and
award them to Plaintiff in the amount of $880.00, inclusive of all three
Motions.
 
Conclusion
            Accordingly,
all three Motions are granted, and the Court will impose sanctions on
Defendant, and award them to Plaintiff in the amount of $880.00, inclusive
of all three Motions. Defendant is ordered to provide responses and monetary
sanctions within 20 days of this order. 
 
            It
is so ordered.
