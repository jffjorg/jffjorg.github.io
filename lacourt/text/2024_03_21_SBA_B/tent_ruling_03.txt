RULING

BACKGROUND
On November 22, 2022, plaintiff
S.W. filed a complaint against defendants Ginder Marshall, M.D., an individual,
and Ginder Marshall, M.D., a professional corporation for (1) sexual assault
and battery, (2) IIED, (3) medical battery, (4) failure to obtain informed
consent, and (5) negligent misrepresentation. 

On April 27, 2023, the court
overruled defendants’ demurrer as to the 1st and 2nd causes of action and
sustained with leave to amend as to the 3rd, 4th, and 5th causes of
action.  The court denied the motion to
strike. 
On May 16, 2023, plaintiff filed a
FAC for (1) sexual assault and battery and (2) IIED.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
45-Day Rule: 
This motion must be served within 45 days after service of the response
in question (extended if served by mail, overnight delivery, or fax; see CCP
§1013); otherwise, the demanding party waives the right to compel any further
response to the CCP §2031.010 demand. 
CCP §§2031.310(c), 2016.050; see Sperber
v. Robinson (1994) 26 Cal. App. 4th 736, 745.  The 45-day time limit is mandatory and
jurisdictional.  Sexton v. Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal. App. 4th 1403, 1410.  The parties, however, can also agree in
writing on a specific later date by which to file the motion to compel.  CCP §2031.310(c). 
Meet-and-Confer Requirement: 
The motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a
declaration showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the issues
outside of court (so-called “meet and confer”). 
CCP §§2016.040, 2031.310(b)(2).
Separate Statement: 
Any motion involving the content of a discovery request or the responses
to such a request shall be accompanied by a separate statement.  This includes a motion to compel further
responses to demand for inspection of documents or tangible things.  CRC Rule 3.1020(a)(3).  
Interrogatories
CCP §2030.300 states:  “(a) On receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following
apply:   (1) An answer to a particular
interrogatory is evasive or incomplete. . . . (3) An objection to an
interrogatory is without merit or too general. 
(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040. (c) Unless notice of this motion is
given within 45 days of the service of the verified response, or any
supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific later date to
which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed in writing,
the propounding party waives any right to compel a further response to the
interrogatories. . . .”
CCP §2030.220 states:  “(a) Each answer in a response to
interrogatories shall be as complete and straightforward as the information
reasonably available to the responding party permits.  (b) If an interrogatory cannot be answered
completely, it shall be answered to the extent possible.  (c) If the responding party does not have
personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that party
shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the
information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations, except where
the information is equally available to the propounding party.”
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiff
S.W. requests that the court compel defendant Ginder Marshall, M.D. to provide
further responses to Special Interrogatory, No. 6. 
            No.
6 requests:  “Identify all persons who
made Complaints of Misconduct against Marshall from 2000 to present.  (As used herein, the term ‘Identify’ shall
mean to provide the name and last known contact information including phone number,
address, business address (if applicable).” 

            As
background, plaintiff explains that on March 23, 2023, she served Special
Interrogatories, Set One to defendant. 
On June 26, defendant served responses. 
On August 8, 2023, plaintiff’s counsel sent a meet and confer letter to
defense counsel.  Defendant agreed to
provide supplemental responses by August 25, 2023, and to extend plaintiff’s
deadline to file motions to compel further to September 1, 2023.  Defendant did not serve supplemental
responses.  On September 1, 2023,
plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses, including as to Special
Interrogatory, No. 6.  Defendant served
supplemental responses on September 20, 2023. 
At the hearing on October 4, 2023, the court deemed the motion moot as
defendant had served supplemental responses. 
The court awarded sanctions against defense counsel.  
            As
further background, on October 13, 2023, plaintiff’s counsel sent a second meet
and confer letter regarding the supplemental responses, including as to No.
6.  On October 19, 2023, counsel agreed
to attend an IDC on the issue of defendant revealing the name and identifying
information for the 2018 complaint of misconduct against defendants.  Counsel agreed to extend plaintiff’s motion
to compel furthers deadline to two weeks after the parties attended an IDC.  On October 27, 2023, defendant served his
second supplemental responses, including as to No. 6, but only identified
plaintiff and the 2008 complainant against defendant.  In a response to Special Interrogatory No. 4,
defendant had confirmed three complaints of misconduct against defendant in
2008, 2018, and 2023.  Defendant did not
identify the person who made the 2018 complaint against defendant.  Counsel were unable to coordinate scheduling
an IDC before the case was reassigned.  Purportedly,
on January 18, 2024, plaintiff’s counsel obtained information that the court
does not conduct IDCs.  The court notes
that that information is incorrect and that it does conduct IDCs.  On January 23, 2024, defense counsel
responded that defendant would not serve responses to No. 6 identifying the
2018 complainant without a court order.  
            In
response to No. 6, defendant objected on the following grounds:  vague and ambiguous as to “all persons” and
overly broad as to time; seeks information that is not relevant or likely to
lead to the discovery of admissible information; may violate the
attorney-client privilege, attorney work product doctrine, Evidence Code §1157;
violates HIPAA, the physician-patient privilege, and the privacy rights of
third parties.  
            Defendant’s
supplemental response asserted the same objections.  Defendant’s second supplemental response
asserted the same objections and provided two names, but not the name from a
purported 2018 complaint against defendant.
            Plaintiff
argues that such information is highly relevant as to notice, negligence, and
lack of enforcement of reasonable safeguards to prevent abuse to defendants’
patients and that defendant has put the issue of prior complaints of misconduct
against him at issue.  Plaintiff also
states her willingness to enter into a stipulated protective order to protect
the names of any third parties.
            In
opposition, defendant argues that the motion is untimely and unreasonably so
because although counsel agreed to an extension for plaintiff to file a motion
to compel further until two weeks after an IDC, “the ability for the plaintiff
to obtain an IDC date . . . has come and gone due to her own dilatory
conduct.”  Defendant also argues that
plaintiff’s request is inherently violative of the rights of third parties.  Defendant further asserts that the
information requested is irrelevant, inadmissible, and prejudicial as to Dr.
Marshall and less intrusive means exist to obtain the information, although he
does not identify any other means.
 
            The
court rules as follows:  The motion is
timely as counsel agreed to an extension.
            Defendant
objected on the grounds that identifying the former patient who had made a
complaint against him would violate HIPAA and the non-party’s right to
privacy.  The right of privacy is
protected by Article I, section I of the California Constitution.  The right to privacy, however, is not
absolute and even private information can be disclosed in some circumstances.
The court must carefully balance the right of privacy against the need of
discovery.  Britt v. Superior Court
(1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 855-856.  Upon
objection, the party seeking discovery must show a “compelling need” for the
non-party’s information. A compelling need is demonstrated where the
information is “directly relevant” and “essential to the fair resolution” of
the lawsuit.  Id. at 859; Alch
v. Superior Court (2008) 165 Cal. App. 4th 1412, 1431-1432.  Even where the balance weighs in favor of
disclosure of private information, the scope of the disclosure will be narrowly
circumscribed and is permitted only to the extent necessary for a fair
resolution of the lawsuit. Britt, supra, 20 Cal. 3d. at 859.
            Medical
information is protected by the right of privacy.  See John B. v. Superior Court (2006)
38 Cal. 4th 1177, 1198 (citation omitted).  Thus, the non-party has a right to privacy
and defendant’s objection has merit.  In
balancing plaintiff’s purported need for the information and the non-party’s
right to privacy, the court finds that plaintiff has not shown a “compelling
need.”  Plaintiff asserts relevance based
on notice and negligence, but plaintiff is asserting intentional torts.  Further, any need does not outweigh the
non-party’s right to privacy.
The
motion is thus DENIED.
            Sanctions
            Plaintiff
requests $900 in sanctions against defendant Ginder Marshall, M.D. and his
counsel of record. The court finds that defendant acted with substantial
justification.  Thus, sanctions are not
warranted.
 
ORDER
            The motion is DENIED.
            Defendant
is ordered to give notice of ruling.
