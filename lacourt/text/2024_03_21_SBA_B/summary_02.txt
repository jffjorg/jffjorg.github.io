And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants' motions to compel the plaintiff's responses to discovery requests. The plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests by the statutory due date, and therefore waived its objections. The Judge has ordered the plaintiff to respond without objections to the defendants' discovery requests within five days. The Judge has also ordered the truth of the matters deemed admitted in defendant McDaniel's Request for Admissions (Set One) against the plaintiff. The Judge has denied the defendants' request for sanctions against the plaintiff's counsel.
