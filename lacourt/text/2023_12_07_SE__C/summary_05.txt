And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Ford Motor Company's demurrer to the second cause of action for fraud, alleging fraudulent concealment, is OVERRULED.

The judge found that the plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded their fraud claim and that the economic loss rule does not bar their claim. The judge also found that Ford had a duty to disclose the transmission defect to the plaintiffs and that Ford's concealment of the defect was a material omission.

The judge noted that the plaintiffs alleged that they would not have purchased the vehicle if they had known of the transmission defect and that Ford's concealment of the defect was intentional.

The judge cited several cases to support its ruling, including Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp., Jiminez v. Superior Court, and Lazar v. Superior Court.

The judge's tentative ruling is subject to change after review by the parties and the court.
