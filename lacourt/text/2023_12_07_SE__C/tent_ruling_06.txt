TENTATIVE
ORDER
 
Plaintiff Intellectual
Capital Management & Servicer, Inc.’s motion for attorney fees is GRANTED
in the amount of $8,947.50.
 
Moving Party to give NOTICE.

 
On January 24, 2006,
plaintiff L&J Assets, LLC obtained a default judgment against defendant
Peter A. Zuk (“Defendant” or “Judgment Debtor”) in the amount of
$19,615.23. On April 2, 2009, L&J Assets, LLC assigned the judgment to Bag
Fund LLC. On January 13, 2016, the judgment was renewed in the amount of
$39,252.00. On September 17, 2020, Bag Fund LLC assigned the judgment to Intellectual
Capital Management & Servicer, Inc. (“Plaintiff” or
“Judgment Creditor”) On March 14, 2022, the judgment was renewed in the amount
of $70,098.00. 
 
Plaintiff moves for $19,605 in attorney
fees and costs against Defendant as reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing
the judgment. 
 
CCP Section 1021 states: “Except as attorney's fees are
specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of
attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied,
of the parties; but parties to actions or proceedings are entitled to their
costs, as hereinafter provided.”¿A prevailing party is
entitled to recover costs, including attorneys’ fees, as a matter of right.¿
(See CCP §§ 1032(a)(4), 1032(b), 1033.5.)¿¿¿ 
¿ 
CCP
Section 685.040 states:  
¿ 
The judgment creditor
is entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a
judgment.¿ Attorney's fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are not included in
costs collectible under this title unless otherwise provided by law.¿
Attorney's fees incurred in enforcing a judgment are included as costs
collectible under this title if the underlying judgment includes an award of
attorney's fees to the judgment creditor pursuant to subparagraph (A) of
paragraph (10) of subdivision (a) of Section 1033.5. (Emphasis added.) 
¿ 
In
addition, CCP Section 685.080(b) requires: 
 
[t]he notice of motion
shall describe the costs claimed, shall state their amount, and shall be
supported by an affidavit of a person who has knowledge of the facts stating
that to the person's best knowledge and belief the costs are correct, are
reasonable and necessary, and have not been satisfied. The notice of motion
shall be served on the judgment debtor. Service shall be made personally or by
mail.  
 
CCP § 685.080, subdivision (a) allows a Judgment Creditor to claim
costs by noticed motion “before the judgment is satisfied in full, but not
later than two years after the costs have been incurred.” 
 
The
court’s objective is to award attorney’s fee at the fair market value based on
the particular action.¿ (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122,
1132.)¿ “The reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for
similar work.”¿¿(PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084,
1095.)¿¿“‘[T]he fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily begins with the
'lodestar,' i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate . . . .’” (Ketchum, supra, Cal.4th at
1134.)¿ The lodestar method is based on the factors, as relevant to the
particular case: “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2)
the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of
the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award.”¿ (Id., at 1132.)¿ “The ‘experienced trial
judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in his
court, and while his judgment is of course subject to review, it will not be
disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong.’”¿
(Id.)¿ A negative modifier was appropriate when duplicative work had
been performed. (Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th
819.)¿ The burden is on
the party seeking attorney’s fees to prove the reasonableness of the fees. (Center
for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th
603, 615.) 
The party that seeks
payment must “keep records in sufficient detail that a neutral judge can make a
fair evaluation of the time expended, the nature and need for the service, and
the reasonable fees to be allowed.”  (Hensley v. Eckerhart (1983)
461 U.S. 424, 441 (conc. opn. of Burger, C.J.).)  The evidence should
allow the court to consider whether the case was overstaffed, how much time the
attorneys spent on particular claims, and whether the hours were reasonably expended. (ComputerXpress, Inc. v. Jackson (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th
993, 1020.) Block billing is not impermissible per se. (Christian
Research Inst. v. Alnor (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315,
1325.) Trial
courts retain discretion to penalize block billing when the practice prevents
them from discerning which tasks are compensable and which are not. (Heritage
Pac. Fin., LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1011.)  
 
“Padding”
in the form of inefficient or duplicative efforts is not subject to
compensation. (Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) 
 
In challenging attorney
fees as excessive because too many hours of work are claimed, the opposing
party must point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument
and citations to the evidence. (Premier
Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. Cal. Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564 [“General arguments that
fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice”].)
 
The Court has broad discretion in determining the amount of a reasonable
attorney’s fee award, which will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of
discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or necessary findings not supported by
substantial evidence.” (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008) 167
Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-1394.)  The Court need not explain its calculation
of the amount of attorney’s fees awarded in detail; identifying the factors
considered in arriving at the amount will suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Indus.
Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-275.)
Counsel
for Judgment Creditor seeks $19,605.00 in Attorney’s Fees and Costs incurred
post-judgment between March 8, 2023, to June 19, 2023.   
 
Judgment
Creditor asserts that the original plaintiff sued for breach of contract,
account stated, and open book account, and that the underlying contract allegedly
provided for recovery of attorney fees. Judgment Creditor further asserts that
the Request for Entry of Default Judgment requested an award of attorney fees,
and the judgment entered by the Court contains an award of attorney’s fees of
$895.26. Judgment Creditor submits a copy of the judgment.
(Decl. Quigg, ¶10, Ex. C.)
 
Judgment
Creditor submits the declaration of its attorney Vincent J. Quigg (“Attorney
Quigg”) in support of its request for attorneys’ fees. Quigg states that he
associated attorney Leslie Baker (“Attorney Baker”) to draft pleadings and make
court appearances. (Decl. Quigg, ¶ 3.)
Attorney Quigg states that Attorney Baker has over 35 years’ experience in
bankruptcy and business litigation. (Ibid.) Attorney Quigg’s billing
rate is $375.00 per hour and Attorney Baker’s billing rate is $325.00 per hour,
which Quigg believes are within the range of hourly rates charged by collection
attorneys in the Los Angeles area. (Decl. Quigg, ¶ 7.)
The Court finds Attorney Quigg and Attorney Baker’s hourly rates to be
reasonable. 
 
In reviewing the billing record, the Court finds
that some of the hours spent were not on activities to enforce a judgment. For
example, the Court finds five hours expended on March 8, 2023 to update and
revise motion for award of attorney’s fees and costs, memorandum of points and
authorities, and supporting declarations and to prepare exhibits were not spent
on enforcing a judgment.  (See Ex.
A.) Thus, the Court does not award the time spent on 3/8 to 3/9, part of
3/30, part of 4/15, 4/17 to 4/21, part of 4/29, part of 5/6, part of 5/9, part
of 5/10, part of 5/11, part of 5/18, part of 5/23, part of 5/24, 5/26, and
5/30. (Ibid.) 
 
Without stating who did what, the billing records
state that all work was done at $325 per hour, which implies that Attorney
Baker performed all the work, yet Attorney Quigg states that he associated
Attorney Baker to draft pleadings and make court appearances. (Ibid.)
Judgment Creditor has not provided clarification.  Because of this inconsistency, the Court will
only award work that Attorney Quigg asserts Attorney Baker performed: drafting
pleadings and making court appearances. Thus, the Court awards 1.3 hours of the
work performed on 5/24 for a total of $422.50. 
 
Judgment Creditor also submits the declarations
of its attorney Ron Hacker (“Attorney Hacker”) in support of its request for
attorney fees. Attorney Hacker states that after the Court denied defendant’s
Motion to Vacate Default Judgment, Defendant filed an appeal, and Judgment
Creditor had to defend the appeal. Attorney Hacker negotiated and paid a
non-refundable retainer of $2,000 to appellate attorney Richard L. Antognini (“Attorney
Antognini”) on behalf of Judgment Creditor. (Decl. Hacker, ¶ 6.) Hacker states
that Defendant did not file his opening brief, the appeal was dismissed, and Attorney
Antognini did not bill Judgment Creditor any additional fees. (Ibid.) In
addition, Hacker states that Judgment Creditor used the retainer fees quickly
because Attorney Antognini bills at $650 an hour and the retainer covered 3.8
hours of his time, which he spent becoming familiar with the case and the
appeal and strategizing with Judgment Creditor. (Reply Decl. Hacker, ¶ 3.) 
 
Judgment Creditor’s counsel has not supported why
$650 an hour is a reasonable rate for Attorney Antognini. Defendant has not asserted
or argued that it is unreasonable. Based on the Court’s own knowledge about
billing rates for appellate attorneys in the Los Angeles area, it finds this
rate reasonable. Thus, it awards the $2,000.00 attorney fees for work performed
by Attorney Antognini.  
 
Judgment Creditor also submits the declaration of
its attorney Richard M. Fannan (“Attorney Fannan”) in support of its request
for attorney fees. Fannan states that he is a 1977 graduate of University of
California Berkeley Law School and has been practicing for the last 45 years
with an emphasis on representing financial institutions and creditor rights.
(Decl. Fannan, ¶ 17.) He states his normal hourly rate is $450 per hour. (Decl.
Fannan, ¶ 18.) The Court finds Attorney Fannan’s hourly rate to be reasonable. 
 
In reviewing the billing record, the Court finds
that some of the hours spent were not on activities to enforce a judgment. For
example, the Court finds 1.5 hours expended on March 1, 2023, to draft an
opposition to motion to tax costs was not spent on enforcing a judgment.  (See Ex. B.) Thus, the Court does
not award the time spent on 3/1 to part of 3/7, part of 3/8 to 3/29, 4/14,
4/15, 5/5, part of 5/11, and 5/23 to 5/29. (Ibid.) 
 
Judgment Debtor challenges some of Attorney
Fannan’s billing as duplicative and excessive. Judgment Debtor also challenges
some of the billing as unrelated, specifically the 4/25 entry, which states,
“Review documentation for the Krayzman litigation.” In reply, Judgment Creditor
submitted evidence that it is related. (Reply Decl. Quigg, ¶¶ 4, 5.)  Of the remaining time entries, the Court does
not find them duplicative or excessive. Thus, the Court awards 14.5 hours of
attorney work at $450 per hour for a total of $6,075.00. 
 
In
total, the Judgment Creditor incurred $8,947.50 in post-judgment attorneys’
fees and costs. 
 
Accordingly,
Judgment Creditor’s request for attorney’s fees and costs is GRANTED in the amount
of $8,947.50.  
 L&J Assets, LLC v. Peter A. Zuk, et al.
CASE
NO.:  NOR05CR1266
HEARING:
 12/7/23
 
#8
TENTATIVE
ORDER
 
Defendant Peter A.
Zuk’s motion for acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment is DENIED.
 
Moving Party to give NOTICE.

 
On January 24, 2006,
plaintiff L&J Assets, LLC obtained a default judgment against defendant
Peter A. Zuk (“Defendant” or “Judgment Debtor”) in the amount of
$19,615.23. On April 2, 2009, L&J Assets, LLC assigned the judgment to Bag
Fund LLC. On January 13, 2016, the judgment was renewed in the amount of
$39,252.00. On September 17, 2020, Bag Fund LLC assigned the judgment to Intellectual
Capital Management & Servicer, Inc. (“Plaintiff” or
“Judgment Creditor”) On March 14, 2022, the judgment was renewed in the amount
of $70,098.00. 
 
Defendant
moves for (1) an order directing Plaintiff to file an acknowledgement of
satisfaction in full, (2) an order allowing the deposit of funds to satisfy the
judgment with the court, or (3) a determination if any amount is due on the
judgment and allow such amount to be paid into court. 
 
CCP
§ 724.010 et seq. sets forth the procedures for satisfaction of a
judgment.  “A money judgment may be satisfied by payment of the full
amount required to satisfy the judgment....”  (CCP § 724.010(a); see also Quintana
v. Gibson (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 89, 93-95 [CCP § 724.050 is exclusive
method for obtaining an order for entry of satisfaction of judgment].) 
“Where a money judgment is satisfied by payment to the judgment creditor by
check or other form of noncash payment that is to be honored upon presentation
by the judgment creditor for payment, the obligation of the judgment creditor
to give or file an acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment arises only when
the check or other form of noncash payment has actually been honored upon
presentation for payment.”  (CCP § 724.010(c).)  “This subdivision
addresses the timing of a judgment creditor's obligation to file an
acknowledgment of satisfaction, not when a judgment is deemed to have been
fully satisfied.”  (Gray1 CPB, LLC v. SCC Acquisitions, Inc. (2015)
233 Cal.App.4th 882, 893.)   
 
If
the judgment creditor fails to do so, the judgment debtor may demand compliance
and, failing that, move to compel compliance.  (County of Santa Clara
v. Escobar (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 555, 577, citing CCP § 724.050(a),
(d).)  “If the judgment has been satisfied, the judgment creditor shall
comply with the demand not later than 15 days after actual receipt of the
demand.”  (CCP § 724.050(c).)   
 
If
the judgment creditor does not comply with the demand within the time allowed,
the person making the demand may apply to the court on noticed motion for an
order requiring the judgment creditor to comply with the demand. The notice of
motion shall be served on the judgment creditor. Service shall be made
personally or by mail. If the court determines that the judgment has been
satisfied and that the judgment creditor has not complied with the demand, the
court shall either (1) order the judgment creditor to comply with the demand or
(2) order the court clerk to enter satisfaction of the judgment. (CCP
§ 724.050(d).) 
 
CCP §¿724.050(e) provides: "If the judgment has been
satisfied and the judgment creditor fails without just cause to comply with the
demand within the time allowed, the judgment creditor is liable to the person
who made the demand for all damages sustained by reason of such failure and
shall also forfeit one hundred dollars ($100) to such person. Liability under
this subdivision may be determined in the proceedings on the motion pursuant to
subdivision (d) or in an action." 
 
CCP §¿724.080 provides: "In an action or proceeding
maintained pursuant to this chapter, the court shall award reasonable
attorney's fees to the prevailing party." 
 
Preliminarily, the Court addresses Defendant’s
requests for judicial notice. Defendant requests judicial notice of (1)
Order/Ruling issued on May 18, 2023, (2) Notice of Ruling filed on June 13,
2023, (3) Writ of Execution issued October 30, 2023, (4) Defendant’s Reply to
Plaintiff’s First, Second, and Third Amended Memorandum of Costs (without
exhibits.) A
court may take judicial notice of the contents of its own records. (Dwan v.
Dixon (1963) 216 Cal.App.2d 260, 265.) 
 
Thus,
the Court grants the four requests of judicial notice. 
 
Both parties agree that Plaintiff filed an acknowledgement of
partial satisfaction of judgment of $106,000.00 on January 9, 2023. On review
of the moving papers, the dispositive issue as to the instant motion is whether
Defendant has satisfied the judgment, or whether he is required to pay a
further $43,071.50, which comprises of (1) $4,084.00 interest accrued on the
judgment and (2) attorney fees of $37,407.50 that the Court granted on May 18,
2023, and (3) $1,580.00 in discovery sanctions. 
 
Defendant argues that he paid the amount awarded in costs and that
there is an overpayment because on May 18, 2023, the Court awarded $35,560.00
in costs, which brings the total owed to $105,658.00. Defendant also argues
that the discovery sanction and attorney fees were not awarded according to the
court’s order on May 18, 2023. Defendant further argues that the attorney fees
awarded are duplicative of what the Court awarded in costs. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that Defendant did not include the
$4,084.00 in interest that had accrued and the attorney fees awarded for
post-judgment enforcement in the amount of $37,407.50 and discovery sanctions
of $1,580.00. Plaintiff also argues that the amounts awarded by the Court in
discovery sanctions and attorney fees are stated elsewhere and that Defendant
is attempting to relitigate the attorney fees motion. 
 
When postjudgment enforcement costs are allowed,
they become part of the principal amount of the judgment. (Code Civ. Pro., §
685.070, subd. (d), § 685.090, subd. (a).) Therefore, interest accrues upon
those costs at the rate of ten percent per annum. (§ 685.010, subd. (a).) (Lucky United Properties Inv., Inc. v. Lee (2010) 185 Cal. App. 4th 125, 138.) 
 
Here, the Order that Defendant refers states that “the motions for
orders compelling responses to interrogatories and requests for production are
denied as moot and its requests for sanctions are granted.” (Request for
Judicial Notice (“RJN”), Ex. A.) The Order also states that the motion for
attorney fees is granted. (RJN, Ex. A.) While the Court did not state the
amounts awarded in the Order, it still awarded the fees and sanctions. The
Court finds that the amounts awarded are stated elsewhere, such as in the
Notice of Ruling. (RJN, Ex. B.) The Court also finds that the Defendant is
attempting to relitigate the attorney fees motion. 
 
Thus, the Court denies Defendant’s motion for an
order directing Plaintiff to file an acknowledgment of satisfaction in full and
an order allowing the deposit of funds to satisfy the judgment. Because
Plaintiff has not moved for attorney fees, the Court does not grant any. 
 
The Court finds that Defendant owes (1) $4,084.00 interest accrued on the judgment, (2) attorney fees
of $37,407.50 that the Court granted on May 18, 2023, (3) $1,580.00 in
discovery sanction that the Court granted on May 18, 2023, and (4) attorney
fees of $8,947.50 that the Court grants together with this motion.  
 
Motion is
DENIED.
 L&J Assets, LLC v. Peter A. Zuk, et al.
CASE
NO.:  NOR05CR1266
HEARING:
 12/7/23
 
#8
TENTATIVE
ORDER
 
Defendant Peter A.
Zuk’s motion to tax costs and restrain oppressive litigation tactics is DENIED.
 
Moving Party to give NOTICE.

 
On January 24, 2006,
plaintiff L&J Assets, LLC obtained a default judgment against defendant
Peter A. Zuk (“Defendant” or “Judgment Debtor”) in the amount of
$19,615.23. On April 2, 2009, L&J Assets, LLC assigned the judgment to Bag
Fund LLC. On January 13, 2016, the judgment was renewed in the amount of
$39,252.00. On September 17, 2020, Bag Fund LLC assigned the judgment to Intellectual
Capital Management & Servicer, Inc. (“Plaintiff” or
“Judgment Creditor”) On March 14, 2022, the judgment was renewed in the amount
of $70,098.00. 
 
Defendant moves to
strike Item 1(a)(8) in the amount of $38,987.50. Defendant also moves to
restrain Plaintiff from pursuing its oppressive and unreasonable litigation
tactics. 
 
Preliminarily, the Court addresses Defendant’s
requests for judicial notice. Defendant requests judicial notice of (1)
Order/Ruling issued on May 18, 2023, (2) Notice of Ruling filed on June 13,
2023, (3) Writ of Execution issued October 30, 2023, (4) Defendant’s Reply to
Plaintiff’s First, Second, and Third Amended Memorandum of Costs (without
exhibits.) A
court may take judicial notice of the contents of its own records. (Dwan v.
Dixon (1963) 216 Cal.App.2d 260, 265.) 
 
Thus,
the Court grants the four requests for judicial notice. 
 
Within 10 days after
service of the memorandum of costs, the judgment debtor may file with the
court, and serve on the judgment creditor personally or by mail, a noticed
motion to tax costs. (Code Civ. Pro., § 685.070,
subd. (c).) The 10-day period is extended under CCP § 1013 when the memorandum of costs was served by
mail. (Code Civ. Pro., § 685.070, subd. (f).) If a motion to tax
costs is not timely filed, the costs claimed in the memorandum are
allowed. (Code Civ. Pro., § 685.070, subd. (d).) There are no
exceptions to the statutory rule that if no motion to tax costs is made within
the 10-day statutory time period the costs claimed in the memorandum are
allowed, and the language of the rule is mandatory. (Lucky United
Properties Investment, Inc. v. Lee (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 125.)
 
Here, the Memorandum of
Costs was filed and served by U.S. mail on October 6, 2023. (Decl. McCall Jr.,
¶ 2, Ex. “1”) Thus, the 10-day statutory time to tax the costs is October 16,
2023. Because Plaintiff served the memorandum by mail, the period is extended
by five calendar days to October 21, 2023. Defendant moved to tax costs on
October 23, 2023. 
 
Thus, Defendant is untimely,
and the motion is denied. 
 
Defendant does not cite
and there is no authority to support that a motion to restrain oppressive
litigation tactics exists. 
 
Motion is
DENIED.
