 Case Number:  23NWCP00224    Hearing Date:   December 7, 2023    Dept:  C Quality Loan Service Crop. V. All Claimants
 
Jennifer Rivera and Asset Recover Inc. have both made claims
to the excess funds from the foreclosure sale by Petitioner Quality Loan
Service. Jennifer Rivera makes a claim for 75 percent of the surplus based on a
25 percent claim for herself and the assigned 25 percent claims of both Erika
Curp and Victor Ayala. Asset Recovery Inc. makes a claim for “all or a portion”
of the surplus based on an assignment of Anthony Ayala Jr.
Quality Loan Service conducted a non-judicial foreclosure
sale of real property commonly known as 8151 Evergreen Avenue, South Gate,
90280 on March 10, 2023 (the Property). The Property was previously owned by
Anthony Ayala Sr. (Decedent) prior to his passing on April 24, 2020. There was
no proceeding conducted for the administration of Decedent’s estate. (Fox
Decl., Ex. B.) Thus, Decedent’s estate would pass equally to his issue.
However, there is conflicting affidavit evidence regarding the number of issue
of Decedent. Anthony Ayala Jr. states that there are five children: Anthony
Ayala Jr., Jennifer Rivera, Erika Curp, Victor Ayala, and Alexander Ayala.
(Ayala Decl., ¶ 4.) Jennifer Rivera states that there are only four children
including herself, Erika Curp and Victor Ayala with the fourth child being
unnamed. (Rivera Decl., ¶ 3.) Further, Jennifer Rivera states that the deceased
homeowner was Anthony Ayala Jr. at the time of the foreclosure sale. (Rivera
Decl. ¶ 2.) The Court is unable to determine the number of heirs who are
entitled to a portion of the property based on the facts before it. Thus, the
hearing is continued to January 3, 2024 to allow the Claimants to submit
additional evidence regarding the number of heirs entitled to a portion of the
surplus funds.
