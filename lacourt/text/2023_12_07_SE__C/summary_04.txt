The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by the plaintiff, Beatriz Camarillo, to the defendant, Sunrun, Inc., et al.'s unverified answer. The plaintiff's demurrer was unopposed, and the court found that the defendant's answer fails to state facts constituting a valid answer. As a result, the court sustained the defendant's answer with leave to amend. The court also declined to grant the plaintiff's request to dismiss the answer in its entirety, instead noting that a motion to strike is the proper mechanism. The next hearing date is set for December 7, 2023.
