  - It is the law in California as elsewhere that, although a corporation is usually regarded as an entity separate and distinct from its stockholders, both law and equity will, when necessary to circumvent fraud, protect the rights of third persons and accomplish justice, disregard this distinct existence and treat them as identical.
  - The Court finds the existing allegations to be sufficient to allege an alter ego theory of liability against Cross-Defendants.

And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendants with 20 days' leave to amend. The Court notes that while it takes judicial notice of the existence of findings of fact made in the other action, any order is not binding on this Court or control this case.

The cross-complaint alleges breach of contract and express indemnity, but fails to properly plead the existence of the contract. The Court agrees with Cross-Defendants that the Cross-Complaint fails to allege the material terms of the contract or provide a copy of the written instrument. Therefore, it is unclear how Cross-Defendants' alleged actions are a breach of the parties' agreement(s) or that Cross-Complainant is entitled to damages thereunder.

The Court finds the existing allegations to be sufficient to allege an alter ego theory of liability against Cross-Defendants. However, the allegations must be pled with specificity to establish the necessary elements of the cause of action.

Given the liberal policy in favor of granting leave to amend to cure form and substantive defects, the Demurrer is SUSTAINED WITH 20 DAYS' LEAVE TO AMEND.
