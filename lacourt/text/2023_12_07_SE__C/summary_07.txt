And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Plaintiff's counsel, Aldo A. Flores, to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff Cruz Zavala. The motion is based on good cause, as outlined in California Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 3-700(C). Specifically, the client has insisted on presenting a claim or defense that is not warranted under existing law, and the attorney-client relationship has broken down. The judge finds that the continued employment of the attorney would result in a violation of the State Bar Act or these rules, or would render it difficult for the attorney to carry out the employment effectively. The motion is granted, and the attorney shall give notice to the client.
