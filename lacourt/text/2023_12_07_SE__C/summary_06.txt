**Summary in English:**

The tentative ruling is about a court hearing in the case of L&J Assets, LLC v. Peter A. Zuk, et al. The court grants the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees in the amount of $8,947.50. The court also denies the defendant's motion to tax costs and restrain oppressive litigation tactics. The defendant argues that the plaintiff has not complied with the court's order to file an acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment and that the attorney fees awarded are duplicative. The court finds that the defendant owes $4,084.00 in interest accrued on the judgment, $37,407.50 in attorney fees, $1,580.00 in discovery sanctions, and $8,947.50 in attorney fees. The court denies the defendant's motion to restrain oppressive litigation tactics and finds that the plaintiff's actions are reasonable.
