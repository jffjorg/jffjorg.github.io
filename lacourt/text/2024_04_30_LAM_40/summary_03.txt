Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Mighty Enterprises, Inc., and denied the defendant, Chung-Hsin Electric & Machinery Manufacturing Corporation's, motion to quash service of summons. The defendant argued that the service of summons was not in compliance with Taiwanese law, but the court found that the service was properly effected in accordance with California law. The court noted that the defendant failed to point to a treaty between Taiwan and the United States providing that service of process must be effected in Taiwan pursuant to the laws of Taiwan. The court also distinguished the authority cited by the defendant and noted that the plain language of California Code of Civil Procedure section 413.10 permits service of process on a person in a foreign country provided that the Hague Convention does not apply.
