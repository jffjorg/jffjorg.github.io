Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

In this tentative ruling, the court denies the defendants' motion to reclassify the case as a limited civil action. The defendants argued that the plaintiff's damages are limited to $16,446.97, but the court finds that the defendants have failed to sufficiently address how the tax liability damages alleged in the First Amended Complaint cannot put damages in this action beyond $35,000. The court finds that the defendants have failed to meet their burden of showing legal certainty in damages. Therefore, the court denies the defendants' motion to reclassify the case as a limited civil action.
