And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for terminating sanctions brought by Plaintiffs Matt Goss and Bros. against Defendant Paul Woolnough. Defendant failed to comply with a court order to provide discovery, and Plaintiffs are seeking terminating sanctions, including entry of default against Defendant and a default judgment prove-up hearing. The judge finds that the motion is moot because a default prove-up and Order to Show Cause are already scheduled for November 26, 2024. Therefore, the motion is taken off-calendar.
