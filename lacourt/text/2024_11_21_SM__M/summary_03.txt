Summary:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants on claims 1 and 2, and against the defendants on claim 3. The judge has determined that the plaintiff's claims for breach of express warranty and implied warranty of merchantability are without merit, as the plaintiff did not experience any symptoms of the increased risk of fire defect and the defect was remedied on a single visit. The judge has also determined that the plaintiff's claim under Business and Professions Code section 17200 is not supported by the evidence. The judge's ruling is based on the evidence presented and the applicable laws and regulations.
