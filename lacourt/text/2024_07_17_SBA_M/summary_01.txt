And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, granting their motion for summary judgment. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's complaint has no merit and that they failed to present a triable issue of material fact. The judge found that the defendant met their initial burden by showing that one or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established, and that the plaintiff failed to provide specific facts to show a triable issue of material fact. Additionally, the judge found that the defendant's expert testimony, submitted by Dr. James A. Macer, showed that the defendant complied with the applicable standard of care and did not cause or contribute to the plaintiff's injuries. The plaintiff failed to provide expert testimony to controvert the defendant's expert opinion. Therefore, the judge has granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
