And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Credit Corp. Solutions, Inc.'s (Plaintiff) anti-SLAPP motion to strike the Cross-Complaint filed by Mark Ferrera, et al. (Defendants). The Cross-Complaint alleges that Plaintiff engaged in unfair debt collection practices and violated debt collection laws. The judge found that certain specific allegations of the Cross-Complaint implicate protected activity, including the filing of litigation and seeking administrative action. However, the judge also found that the Plaintiff has met its burden to establish a probability of prevailing on the merits of those allegations, as it submitted competent evidence supporting the alleged violations. Therefore, the anti-SLAPP motion to strike the entire Cross-Complaint is denied, and the anti-SLAPP motion to strike the specific allegations noted above that do implicate protected activity is also denied.
