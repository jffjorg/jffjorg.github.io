And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Credit Corp. Solutions, Inc. v. Mark Ferrera, et al., case number 23TRCV04042. The ruling denies Credit Corp. Solutions, Inc.'s special anti-SLAPP motion to strike the cross-complaint filed by Mark Ferrera. The court finds that the cross-complaint arises from the same transaction or occurrence as the complaint, and does not implicate protected speech or petitioning activity. However, the court notes that certain specific allegations in the cross-complaint do implicate protected activity, and therefore the motion to strike those allegations is denied. The court also finds that Credit Corp. Solutions, Inc. has not met its burden to establish a probability of prevailing on the merits of the allegations, and therefore the motion to strike the entire cross-complaint is denied.
