And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Tebbbens v. McKinnon, Case No. 23SMCV02548. The case revolves around a motion to quash service of summons and complaint filed by Defendant McKinnon, who argues that Plaintiff Tebbbens failed to properly serve him. The court previously granted an application for order to serve via publication, as Defendant McKinnon was evading service. The issue is whether proof of service via publication was proper.

The court notes that Plaintiff published the summons in the Los Angeles Times, but failed to provide evidence that publication in the Chicago Tribune was properly effectuated, as ordered. Therefore, the court finds that Plaintiff has not shown sufficient evidence that Defendant was properly served by publication in the Chicago Tribune. As a result, the motion to quash service is GRANTED.
