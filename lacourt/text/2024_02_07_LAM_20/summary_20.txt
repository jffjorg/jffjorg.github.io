And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion to Tax Costs filed by CICO against Plaintiffs Patricia Beecham, Patricia Beecham (co-trustee of the Praxedes E. Running Trust), and Leia Bowers (co-trustee of the Praxedes E. Running Trust). The Court has granted the motion in part, striking $56,700 in prejudgment interest and $1,812.31 in deposition costs. The Court has also denied CICO's request to strike Plaintiffs' post-998 offer costs, finding that the 998 offer was invalid due to its failure to apportion damages between the Plaintiffs. The Court has struck only $1,812.31 in deposition costs, which was agreed to by Plaintiffs was erroneously included. Finally, the Court has granted Plaintiffs' Request for Judicial Notice.
