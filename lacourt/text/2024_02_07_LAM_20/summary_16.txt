The judge's tentative ruling grants the petition of Peachtree Settlement Funding, LLC to approve the transfer of $25,000 in exchange for Jeromy Medina's right to future payments totaling $50,000. The petition was timely served on January 2, 2024, and the required documents were filed. The court finds that the transfer is in Medina's best interests, taking into account his financial situation, the terms of the transaction, and the factors listed in Insurance Code § 10139.5(b). Medina did not receive independent legal or financial advice regarding the proposed transaction, but he was advised to seek such advice and signed a waiver to that effect. The court also finds that the disclosure form signed by Medina complies with the Insurance Code sections on structured settlement transfers. The court's findings are based on the totality of the circumstances, including Medina's financial and economic situation, the terms of the transaction, and the payee's desire to complete the proposed transaction.
