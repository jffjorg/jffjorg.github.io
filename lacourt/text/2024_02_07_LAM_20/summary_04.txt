Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a labor law case involving Jeremy Pfau, a piano instructor, and Riko Weimer International, LLC and Riko Weimer. Pfau alleges that he was not paid for all hours worked, not reimbursed for business expenses, and not given rest breaks. He also claims that he was terminated for complaining about these issues. The defendants filed a cross-complaint alleging that Pfau breached his contract and committed other wrongful acts.

The court denied the defendants' motion to compel further responses to their requests for admission and form interrogatories because they failed to sufficiently meet and confer with Pfau's counsel. The court also denied the defendants' motion for summary adjudication of Pfau's sixth and seventh causes of action for whistleblower retaliation and wrongful termination, finding that there are triable issues of material fact.

The court also denied the defendants' motion for summary adjudication of punitive damages, finding that the evidence of malice, fraud, or oppression is not clear and convincing at this time. Finally, the court continued the trial date to July 22, 2024, to allow for completion of discovery and compliance with meet and confer requirements.
