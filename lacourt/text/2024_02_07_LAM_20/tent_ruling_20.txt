On December 7, 2023, Plaintiffs Patricia Beecham, personal rep. of The Estate of Praxedes E. Running, and Patricia Beecham and Leia Bowers, co-trustees of the Praxedes E. Running Trust filed a memorandum of costs in the amount of $135,237. Defendant CICO seeks to tax Plaintiffs’ costs.“If the items appearing in a cost bill appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to show that they were not reasonable or necessary.  On the other hand, if the items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof is on the party claiming them as costs.  Whether a cost item was reasonably necessary to the litigation presents a question of fact for the trial court and its decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion.”  (Ladas v. Cal. State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 761, 774.) CICO first argues that Plaintiffs’ request for $56,700 in prejudgment interest is improper because the damages in this matter were not certain.Civ. Code § 3287(a), which provides for mandatory prejudgment interest, does not apply here because the amount of damages in this matter was hotly contested.  (Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Trials & Ev. Ch. 17-F [“Where the amount of damages cannot be resolved except by verdict or judgment, prejudgment interest is not appropriate.”].)  Therefore, the request for $56,700 in interest is stricken.CICO next argues that Plaintiffs cannot obtain costs after CICO’s June 28, 2023, 998 offer because CICO offered $200,000 and Plaintiffs ultimately obtained only $81,000 after a jury trial.  Plaintiffs argue that the 998 offer was invalid because (a) it was “upon the condition that Plaintiffs sign an undisclosed settlement agreement in the future that was not attached to the 998 and was never served on Plaintiffs or Plaintiffs’ attorneys”; (b) it “was expressly conditioned both on a Civil Code §1542 waiver from each Plaintiff to release all unknown claims and to release all potential claims that ‘could have been brought.’ Our court of appeal has already ruled that such a 998 offer is invalid because it requires release of claims outside the case”; (c) the release encompasses claims outside of this litigation, but did not include a place for Plaintiffs’ attorneys in those other cases to provide a signature; (d) “CICO’s 998 was conditioned on Plaintiffs execution of a Civil Code §1542 waiver, but did not state that CICO would quitclaim to Plaintiffs CICO’s interests in easements on Plaintiffs’ land or that CICO would maintain those easements in the future, nor did Plaintiffs know whether the undisclosed settlement agreement would contain these material terms”; (e) the offer did not apportion the damages between the Plaintiffs; and (f) the offer was for a “nominal” or “token” amount.“It has long been held that a section 998 offer is effective to shift liability for costs only where the offer was properly allocated as to multiple offerees and was made in a manner allowing individual offerees to accept or reject it. (Hutchins v. Waters (1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 69, 73–74, 123 Cal.Rptr. 819.) This rule has been applied to both plaintiff and defendant offerors, and both where the offer is explicitly and impliedly conditioned on joint acceptance by the offerees. (Weinberg v. Safeco Ins. Co. of America (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1075, 1086–1087, 8 Cal.Rptr.3d 224; Wickware v. Tanner (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 570, 576–577, 61 Cal.Rptr.2d 790; Meissner v. Paulson (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 785, 791, 260 Cal.Rptr. 826.) Where an offer is not apportioned between individual offerees, the inference that the offer must be accepted jointly is inherent.”  (Menees v. Andrews (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1540, 1544.) The 998 offer here is invalid because there is no apportionment between the Plaintiffs and the plain language of the offer does not indicate that one Plaintiff can accept the offer without the other’s acceptance.  Indeed, there is only one signature block provided.  (Cf. Menees v. Andrews (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1540, 1546 [“the offer was made in a single document, which referred to appellants in the conjunctive. Provided with the offer was another document, the notice of acceptance, which again referred to appellants in the conjunctive and, quite tellingly, provided only one signature line—for the attorney who represented both of them.”].)Therefore, the Court will not strike Plaintiffs’ post-998 offer costs.CICO next argues that “Plaintiffs include many filing and motion fees that are either vague or clearly unrelated to the prosecution of their claims against CICO.”The Court finds that CICO failed to carry its burden with respect to filing fees.With respect to deposition costs, the Court will strike only $1,812.31, which Plaintiffs agree was erroneously included. Finally, CICO failed to carry its burden with respect to ordinary witness fees, which are described in Exhibit C of the memorandum of costs, and costs of models and enlargements.In sum, the Motion to Tax Costs is granted in part—specifically, the Court will only strike $56,700 in prejudgment interest and $1,812.31 in deposition costs.The Request for Judicial Notice is granted.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
