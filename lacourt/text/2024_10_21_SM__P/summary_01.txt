Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash, modify, and for a protective order filed by the defendants, Secured Capital Partners (SCP), Victor Franco Noval (Noval Jr.), and Jake Noval. The plaintiff, WVM Holdings, LLC, is seeking financial records from American Express to support its claims of fraudulent transfer and alter ego relationship against the defendants.

The judge denied the defendants' motion to quash the subpoena, but granted their motion to modify the scope of the subpoena to limit it to records from January 1, 2017, onwards. The judge also granted the defendants' request for a protective order to protect the financial privacy of the parties and non-parties.

The judge found that the plaintiff has a legitimate interest in obtaining the financial records to support its claims, and that the defendants' privacy interests are not sufficient to outweigh the need for discovery. The judge also noted that the defendants have the burden of demonstrating a legally protected privacy interest, a reasonable expectation of privacy, and a threatened intrusion, and that they have not met this burden.

The judge's ruling is based on the California Code of Civil Procedure and relevant case law, including Williams v. Superior Court, Hecht v. Sup. Ct., and Rawnsley v. Sup. Ct. The judge's decision is subject to change based on further arguments and evidence presented at the hearing.
