The judge has granted the defendant's unopposed motion to continue the trial and all trial-related dates. The original trial date was October 13, 2023, but the court finds that it does not leave sufficient time for the parties to take necessary depositions. The motion was granted due to the addition of new parties to the action, the filing of a Third Amended Complaint and a First Amended Cross-Complaint, and the lack of a reasonable opportunity for the parties to conduct discovery and prepare for trial. The new trial date is set for late-February 2024, and the court will confer with the parties at the hearing to select the new trial dates.

```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion to continue the trial, which was initially set for October 13, 2023. The continuance is due to the need for further discovery and the addition of new parties to the case. The Judge considered the factors outlined in CRC Rule 3.1332, including the proximity of the trial date, the availability of alternative means to address the problem, and the prejudice that parties or witnesses may suffer as a result of the continuance. The Judge found that a trial continuance to late-February 2024 is reasonable and that all pre-trial deadlines will correspond with the new trial date. The Court will confer with the parties at the hearing to select the new trial dates. The case involves a dispute over the failure of an underground storm water detention system at a new high school in Huntington Park, California, and the Defendant's alleged negligence in the matter.
