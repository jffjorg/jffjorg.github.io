And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's unopposed motion to continue the trial and all trial-related dates. The original trial date was October 13, 2023, but the court finds that it does not leave sufficient time for the parties to take necessary depositions. The motion was granted due to the addition of new parties to the action, the filing of a Third Amended Complaint and a First Amended Cross-Complaint, and the lack of a reasonable opportunity for the parties to conduct discovery and prepare for trial. The new trial date is set for late-February 2024, and the court will confer with the parties at the hearing to select the new trial dates.
