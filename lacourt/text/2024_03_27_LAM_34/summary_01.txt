And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies, without prejudice, Mira Jeon Kim's motion for judgment on the pleadings (MJOP) regarding the First Amended Complaint (FAC). The judge also grants, in part, Mira Jeon Kim's motions to compel Jan Bidasha to respond to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production. Jan Bidasha must serve responses to these discovery requests, without objections, within 30 days of the issuance of this order.

The judge denies Mira Jeon Kim's request for monetary sanctions. The judge finds that the circumstances of the case, including the recent change in the relationship between this case and another related case, mitigate against issuing monetary sanctions at this time.

The judge notes that Mira Jeon Kim's arguments regarding issue preclusion and claim preclusion are unripe and may be raised again after judgment is entered in the related case. The judge also finds that the issues in this case are likely to be actually tried a couple of weeks after the hearing on this motion.
