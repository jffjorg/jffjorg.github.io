  Case Number:  23STCP00049    Hearing Date:   November 19, 2024    Dept:  82 Paul W. Harrison v. Pasadena Lodge No. 672, Case No.
23STCP00049 THERE WILL BE NO HEARING ON THIS MATTERPetitioner
Paul W. Harrison (“Petitioner”) filed a petition for writ of mandate on January
9, 2023.  Petitioner filed a first amended petition on April 19,
2023.  On August 9, 2023, the court (Beckloff, J.) granted an order
sustaining Respondents’ demurrer to the first amended petition and granting
Respondents’ motion to strike.  The court granted leave to amend.
 
Petitioner
filed the operative second amended petition on August 30, 2023. 
Respondents again filed a demurrer and motion to strike (on September 29,
2023.)  The motions were originally set for hearing on February 9, 2024,
but the parties executed several stipulations to continue the hearing
date.  Eventually, the motions were calendared for January 6, 2025, at
9:30 a.m.  The parties executed a further stipulation to continue the
hearing to February 2025.  The court denied that stipulation but continued
the hearing to a regular calendar day: January 10, 2025, at 9:30 a.m.
 
Now,
Petitioner has filed an ex parte application for leave to amend and a “Request
to Reschedule the Hearing,” which the court construes as an ex parte
application to continue the hearing date.  The court rules on these
matters without a hearing, per Code of Civil Procedure section 166(a)(1).
 
The
court denies the ex parte application to continue the hearing date.  These
motions were filed over one year ago and must be decided.  The request
provides no facts in support of the request, so there is no good cause.  
 
The
court denies the ex parte application to the extent it seeks leave to amend
before the court resolves the pending motions.  Contrary to Petitioner’s
argument, there will be prejudice: Defendants have already prepared and filed
their motions, and the court has already reserved a hearing date. 
Moreover, these motions must be resolved, given the amount of time they have
been pending.  Nevertheless, the court will continue the ex parte
application to January 10, 2025, at 9:30 a.m.  The court will consider its
contents in determining whether to grant leave to amend, if the court sustains
the demurrer and/or grants the motion to strike. 
 
Based
upon the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
1.      
The court denies the request for a continuance.
 
2.      
The court continues the hearing on the ex parte application for leave to amend
to January 10, 2025, at 9:30 a.m.
 
3.      
The court’s clerk shall provide notice via email.
