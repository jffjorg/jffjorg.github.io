And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the matters before it. The case involves a petition for writ of mandate filed by Paul W. Harrison against Pasadena Lodge No. 672. The court has already granted an order sustaining the defendants' demurrer and granting their motion to strike the plaintiff's first amended petition. The plaintiff has filed a second amended petition and the defendants have filed a demurrer and motion to strike again.

The plaintiff has now filed an ex parte application to continue the hearing date and another ex parte application for leave to amend. The court has denied both of these applications. The court finds that there is no good cause for continuing the hearing date, as the motions have been pending for over a year. The court also finds that there will be prejudice if the plaintiff is allowed to amend before the court resolves the pending motions, as the defendants have already prepared and filed their motions and the court has already reserved a hearing date.

Despite denying the ex parte applications, the court will continue the ex parte application for leave to amend to January 10, 2025, at 9:30 a.m. The court will consider the contents of the application in determining whether to grant leave to amend, if the court sustains the demurrer and/or grants the motion to strike.
