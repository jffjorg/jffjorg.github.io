English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the City of Los Angeles's demurrer to the complaint with 20 days leave to amend. The plaintiff, Sonia Oliva, alleges causes of action for negligence and premises liability stemming from a slip and fall at Bradley Terminal at LAX. The Judge finds that the plaintiff's complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, specifically lacking allegations of timely presentation of a government claim and adequate identification of a statutory basis for liability. The Judge cites various California statutes and case law, including the California Tort Claims Act, to support the ruling. The plaintiff is given 20 days to amend the complaint to cure the deficiencies.
