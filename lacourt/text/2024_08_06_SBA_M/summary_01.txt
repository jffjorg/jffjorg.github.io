Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to set aside the defaults entered against them. The defaults were entered prematurely by the clerk, who should have waited until the expiration of the time to respond to the First Amended Complaint before entering the defaults. The defendants claim they did not receive the First Amended Complaint due to an incorrect address, and the judge has accepted this as a valid excuse. The judge has ordered the defendants to file and serve their proposed Answer within three days and to give notice of this ruling.
