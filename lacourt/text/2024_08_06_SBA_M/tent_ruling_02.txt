City of Los
Angeles’s Demurrer to Complaint     
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING

City of Los Angeles’s Demurrer to Complaint is sustained
with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
Background 
 
Plaintiff filed the Complaint on April 24, 2023. Plaintiff
alleges the following facts. Plaintiff slipped and fell at Bradley Terminal at
LAX. Plaintiff alleges causes of action for negligence and premises liability.
 
Meet and Confer
 
Defendant filed a meet and confer declaration in
sufficient compliance with CCP § 430.41.  (Decl., Ryan Reza, ¶¶ 6-9.)
 
Demurrer

A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a
matter of law and raises only questions of law. (Schmidt v. Foundation Health
(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706.)  In
testing the sufficiency of the complaint, the court must assume the truth of
(1) the properly pleaded factual allegations; (2) facts that can be reasonably
inferred from those expressly pleaded; and (3) judicially noticed matters. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) 
The Court may not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of
fact or law.  (Moore v. Conliffe
(1994) 7 Cal.App.4th 634, 638.) Because a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency
of a complaint, the plaintiff must show that the complaint alleges facts
sufficient to establish every element of each cause of action.  (Rakestraw v. California Physicians
Service (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 39, 43.) 
Where the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action, courts should sustain the demurrer.  (C.C.P., § 430.10(e); Zelig v. County of
Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.App.4th 1112, 1126.)
 
Sufficient facts are the essential facts of the case
"with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently specific to
acquaint the defendant with the nature, source, and extent of his cause of
action.”  (Gressley v. Williams
(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 636, 643-644.) 
"Whether the plaintiff will be able to prove the pleaded facts is
irrelevant to ruling upon the demurrer." 
(Stevens v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 605,
609–610.)  Under Code Civil Procedure §
430.10(f), a demurrer may also be sustained if a complaint is “uncertain.”  Uncertainty exists where a complaint’s
factual allegations are so confusing they do not sufficiently apprise a
defendant of the issues it is being asked to meet.  (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp.
(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.)
            Defendant’s
demurrer to the Complaint is sustained with 20 days leave to amend. Plaintiff
fails to state facts sufficient to state a cause of action. 
            “To
state a cause of action for negligence, a plaintiff must allege (1) the
defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of care, (2) the defendant breached that
duty, and (3) the breach proximately caused the plaintiff's damages or
injuries.” Lueras v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP (2013) 221
Cal.App.4th 49, 62. The elements of a cause of action for premises liability
are the same as those for negligence. Accordingly, the plaintiff must prove,
legal duty to use due care, a breach of such legal duty, and the breach as the
proximate or legal cause of the resulting injury.” Jones v. Awad (2019)
39 Cal.App.5th 1200, 1207 (internal citations and quotations omitted).
 
            “Before
suing a public entity, the plaintiff must present a timely written claim for
damages to the entity. [. . .] Timely claim presentation is not merely a
procedural requirement, but is, as this court long ago concluded, a condition
precedent to plaintiff's maintaining an action against defendant[,] and thus an
element of the plaintiff's cause of action. Complaints that do not allege facts
demonstrating either that a claim was timely presented or that compliance with
the claims statute is excused are subject to a general demurrer for not stating
facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” Shirk v. Vista Unified
School Dist. (2007) 42 Cal.4th 201, 208–209 (internal citations and
quotations omitted).
 
            “[U]nder
the Tort Claims Act all governmental tort liability is based on statute, the
general rule that statutory causes of action must be pleaded with particularity
is applicable. Thus, to state a cause of action against a public entity, every
fact material to the existence of its statutory liability must be pleaded with
particularity.” Lopez v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. (1985) 40
Cal.3d 780, 795 (internal quotation omitted).
 
            Here,
Plaintiff has failed to allege facts demonstrating timely presentation of a
government claim and failed to adequately identify a statutory basis for
liability. 
 
            Therefore,
Defendant’s demurrer is sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
 
            Defendant
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
