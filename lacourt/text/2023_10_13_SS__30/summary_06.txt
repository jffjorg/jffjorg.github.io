And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the request for entry of default judgment filed by plaintiff Thomas Weidenmuller. The plaintiff had previously identified defects in his application, including a demand for attorneys' fees and discrepancies in the calculation of costs and damages. The plaintiff has since remedied these defects and provided evidence of medical bills to support his demand for special damages. The court finds that the plaintiff's application is now compliant with California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1800, and therefore grants the request for entry of default judgment.
