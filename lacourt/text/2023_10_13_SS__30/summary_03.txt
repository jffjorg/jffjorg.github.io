And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions to compel physical examinations of the plaintiffs, Antonio Ramirez and Alexander Ramirez. The motions, filed by the defendant, Tara Lee Baum, are denied. The Judge finds that the defendant's motion does not meet the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 2016.040, which requires a meet and confer declaration to be included with the motion. Additionally, the Judge notes that the motion is essentially two separate motions, one for each plaintiff, and therefore should have been filed and paid for separately. The Judge orders the defendant to give notice of the denial.
