Here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal entered on April 27, 2023. The Plaintiff's counsel, Andrew Echavarria, declared that the office experienced technological problems with their computers and internet connection throughout March and April, which led to the failure to calendar the OSC hearing for April 27, 2023. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's motion is timely and that the failure to appear at the OSC was due to the inadvertence of counsel to calendar the matter due to technological issues. As a result, the Court grants the motion and orders the Plaintiff to give notice. The Court also declines to impose any penalties against the Plaintiff or the Plaintiff's attorney, as the Defendant has not filed an answer in this action.
