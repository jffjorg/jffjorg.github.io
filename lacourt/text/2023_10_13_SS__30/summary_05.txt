And here is the English-text summary:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on three motions to compel further responses to requests for production of documents. The motions, which are separate, must be filed and served individually with payment of the filing fee for each. The court will only consider Set Two of the original pleadings, but because counsel failed to sign and date his declaration, it must be re-submitted. The moving party must give notice and the Judicial Assistant is to calendar a hearing date for all three motions, set for the same time and date. The normal pleading schedule is ordered.
