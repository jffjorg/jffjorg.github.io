 Case Number:  21STCV45993    Hearing Date:   October 13, 2023    Dept:  30 MIGUEL ANGEL RODRIGUEZ MARROQUIN vs ANN JIHAE SINMotion to Deem Admissions AdmittedTentative:
Defendant’s motion to deem RFAs admitted is GRANTED. The Court orders that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in Defendant's request be deemed admitted. The request for sanctions is GRANTED,
in part.  Plaintiff is ordered
to pay Plaintiff $290 in monetary sanctions within 30 days. Moving party is to
give notice of this ruling.

Discussion:  

Defendant’s counsel testifies
that he propounded RFAs on Defendant on March 10, 2023. (Capell Decl., ¶4.) To
date, Plaintiff has not served responses to the RFAs. (Id.,
¶7.)  Where there has been no timely response to requests for
admissions, a “requesting party may move for an order that the genuineness of
any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the requests be deemed
admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
section 2023.010).” The court “shall” grant the motion to deem requests for
admission admitted “unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a proposed
response to the requests for admission that is in substantial compliance with
Section 2033.220.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(c).)  Here, to date, Plaintiff has not substantially complied since the filing of this motion.

Sanctions with respect to motions to deem requests for admissions admitted are
mandatory if a party to whom the requests for admissions have been directed
failed to serve a timely response to the request for admission. (Code Civ.
Proc., §2033.280(c).) Accordingly, the Court awards sanctions. Because the
motion was unopposed, the Court awards Plaintiff $290 in monetary sanctions
which represents one hour of attorney time at a rate of $230, plus $60 in
filing fees.
