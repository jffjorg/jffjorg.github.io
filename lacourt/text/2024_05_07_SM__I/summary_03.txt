And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion to quash service of process for lack of personal jurisdiction brought by defendant Gershon, Apyx's former CEO. The plaintiff alleges that Gershon was one of the major architects of the plan to market the product in question, even though Apyx knew that the product had not been approved for use and could cause harm to patients. The plaintiff argues that Gershon's actions constituted purposeful availment of California law and protections, and that California was a major market for the product.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that Gershon has committed acts personally that would constitute purposeful availment in California that would be sufficient to establish minimum contacts for purposeful jurisdiction. The judge also notes that the plaintiff's allegations that Gershon participated in the marketing plan and knew that the product could cause harm to patients are not sufficient to establish jurisdiction over Gershon.

The judge is considering the plaintiff's argument that Gershon's actions as a corporate officer could be sufficient to establish jurisdiction, but finds that the answer is "no" without more. The judge is giving the parties an opportunity to brief the issue before ruling definitively.
