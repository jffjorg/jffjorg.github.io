And here is the English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to amend the complaint, which would allow plaintiffs to assert a new theory of liability against the defendant. The defendant had moved for summary judgment, arguing that plaintiffs could not show that, but for the defendant's alleged malpractice, a better result would have been obtained. The Judge initially inclined to grant the motion, but allowed further briefing. The Judge then reviewed new evidence, including an email exchange between the defendant and the seller's counsel, which showed that the defendant had discussed making plaintiffs whole for out-of-pocket expenses. The Judge is concerned that the defendant failed to fully communicate this information to plaintiffs. The Judge grants the motion to amend the complaint, allowing plaintiffs to assert a new theory of liability. The Judge also vacates the trial date and will discuss a new trial schedule with counsel.
