TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Defendant Nicholas
Joseph Gutierrez’s demurrer to plaintiff’s complaint is OVERRULED. 
 
Moving Party to give NOTICE.

 
 
Background
 
This
is about a motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff sues for negligence and Violation
of Civil Code section 52.1. Defendant Nicholas Joseph Gutierrez demurs to the
Violation of Civil Code section 52.1 cause of action on the grounds that it
does not state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action and it is
uncertain.
 
Meet
and Confer
 
The
parties satisfied the meet-and-confer requirements. (Decl. Lascola, ¶¶ 4 to 5; Code.
Civ. Proc., § 430.41.) 
 
Violation
of Civil Code section 52.1
 
To state a cause of action under section
52.1 there must first be violence or intimidation by threat of violence. (Cabesuela v. Browning-Ferris Indus. of Calif., Inc.
(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 101, 111.) Second, the violence or threatened violence
must be due to plaintiff's membership in one of the specified classifications
set forth in Civil Code section 51.7 or a group similarly protected by
constitution or statute from hate crimes. (Ibid.)
 
Defendant demurs on the grounds that
Plaintiff has not satisfied the threshold to allege a Civil Code section 52.1
violation against Defendant. Defendant asserts that Plaintiff did not allege
that he was acting within the scope of his duties as a County of Los Angeles
employee because Plaintiff did not allege that he was an employee with the
County of Los Angeles. However, as stated above, that is not the law. 
 
Defendant also demurs on the grounds
that the cause of action lacks “ordinary and concise language” and that any
allegations are innuendo and speculative. “[D]emurrers for uncertainty are disfavored and
are granted only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot
reasonably respond.”  (Mahan v. Charles W. Chan Ins. Agency, Inc. (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 841, 848, fn.
3.)  Based on its review of the
complaint, the Court does not find that the cause of action is so
incomprehensible that a defendant cannot reasonably respond. 
 
Based
on the above, the Court OVERRULES the demurrer.
