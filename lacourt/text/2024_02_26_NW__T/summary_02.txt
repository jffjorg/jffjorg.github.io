And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's ex parte application to continue the trial for 30 days. The final status conference is also continued for 30 days. Discovery is not reopened, except for the deposition of David Golbahar, who is an expert witness. The judge has set an OSC (Order to Show Cause) for entry of default against the trust trustee for failing to have counsel. The trustee will have 5 ½ months to locate a new attorney by the time of the OSC. The court will consider allowing David Golbahar to testify at trial if he has not been produced for deposition as an expert witness, but the defendant must provide evidence of their attempt to depose him prior to the hearing.
