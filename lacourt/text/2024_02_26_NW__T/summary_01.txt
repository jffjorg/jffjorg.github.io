And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration and motion to vacate or set aside the court's June 22, 2023 order to dismiss the action are denied. The plaintiff's motion failed to attach a proof of service and did not provide admissible evidence to support the motion. The court also noted that the plaintiff's memorandum of points and authorities was lacking, and therefore, the plaintiff's contentions were considered waived. The court further ruled that the motion was untimely, as it was filed on December 22, 2023, after the jurisdictional time limit for a motion for reconsideration had expired.

The judge also denied the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration. The defendant's legal authority for the motion to strike was Code of Civil Procedure sections 435 and 436, which authorize the court to strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading or strike any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court. However, the court noted that nothing in these statutes authorizes the court to strike a motion, let alone a motion for reconsideration. The court also denied the defendant's request for an OSC re sanctions, as the defendant failed to comply with the procedural requirements for the sanctions.
