And here is the English-text summary:

This is the tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by Defendant Maria Hogan (also known as Maria Bowers) to Plaintiff George Franco's Complaint. The Complaint alleges four causes of action: tortious breach of warranty of habitability, breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, negligence, and nuisance. The Defendant argued that the first and second causes of action are contract claims and that Plaintiff must plead whether the contract is written, oral, or implied, and either attach the contract or plead the terms verbatim. The Judge ruled that the implied covenants of habitability and quiet enjoyment are implied in residential leases and that Plaintiff's claims are based on tort, not contract. The Judge also overruled the Defendant's demurrer to the first and second causes of action, holding that Plaintiff's pleading was sufficient to place the Defendant on notice of the claims alleged against her.

The Defendant also argued that all four causes of action are uncertain because Plaintiff failed to allege specific dates of the tenancy and breaches, but the Judge ruled that this was a matter for discovery, not demurrer, and that the Defendant failed to present any legal authority to support their contention. Therefore, the Judge overruled the Defendant's demurrer to the second, third, and fourth causes of action as well.
