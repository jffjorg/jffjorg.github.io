```

And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, Guillermo Alamilla Canul, has moved for summary adjudication of the issue of whether the defendant owed a duty to consider him an employee (and not an independent contractor). The court finds that this is not a proper subject of summary adjudication because it requires making factual findings, rather than determining a legal question. The court also notes that the plaintiff's argument that the issue is similar to contractual duties, which can be subject to summary adjudication, is unconvincing. The court therefore denies the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication.
