MOTION:                  Motion
for Leave to Amend to File a Second Amended Complaint
HEARING DATE:   7/3/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
If a party
wishes to amend a pleading after an answer has been filed, or after a demurrer
has been filed and after the hearing on the demurrer, or if he or she has
already amended the pleading as a matter of course, the party must obtain permission
from the court before amendment. (CCP §§ 473(a)(1), 576.) 
 
Motions
for leave to amend the pleadings are directed to the sound discretion of the
court. “The court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be
proper, allow a party to amend any pleading . . ..” (CCP § 473(a)(1); see CCP §
576.) Policy favors liberally granting leave to amend so that all disputed
matters between the parties may be resolved. (See Howard v. County of San Diego (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1422,
1428.) Absent prejudice to the adverse party, the court may permit amendments
to the complaint “at any stage of the proceedings, up to and including trial.”
(Atkinson v. Elk Corp.
(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761 [internal quotes omitted].) Where leave is
sought to add entirely new claims, the court may grant leave to amend if the
new claims are based on the same general set of facts, and the amendment will
not prejudice the opposing party. (Austin
v. Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co. (1961) 56 Cal.2d 596, 600-602; Glaser v. Meyers (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 770, 777 [holding
trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting amendment of complaint,
which originally alleged constructive eviction, to allege retaliatory eviction
where the new claim was based on the same general set of facts].)
 
Although
denial is rarely justified, a judge has discretion to deny leave to amend if
the party seeking the amendment has been dilatory, and the delay has prejudiced
the opposing party. (Morgan v. Superior
Court (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 527, 530; Hirsa v. Superior Court
(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490). An opposing party is prejudiced where the
amendment would necessitate a trial delay along with a loss of critical
evidence, added preparation expense, increased burden of discovery, etc. (Magpali
v. Farmers Group, Inc. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 471, 486-488 [leave properly
denied where plaintiff sought leave on the eve of trial, nearly two years after
the complaint was originally filed and gave no explanation for the delay which
prejudiced defendant who did not discover or depose many of the witnesses who would
support the new allegations and had not marshaled evidence in opposition of the
new allegations].)
 
Procedurally,
a motion for leave to amend must state with particularity what allegations are
to be amended. Namely, it must state what allegations in the previous pleading
are proposed to be deleted and/or added, if any, and where, by page, paragraph,
and line number. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(a)(2)-(3).) The motion must be accompanied
by a declaration specifying: (1) the effect of the amendment; (2) why the
amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts giving rise to the
amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why the request for
amendment was not made earlier. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(b).) The motion must also be
accompanied by the proposed amended pleading, numbered to differentiate it from
the prior pleadings or amendments. (CRC, Rule 3.1324(a)(1).) It is within the
court’s discretion to require compliance with Rule 3.1324 before granting leave
to amend. (Hataishi v. First American Home Buyers Protection Corp. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 1454, 1469.)
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff April Whitton moves for leave
to file the Second Amended Complaint (SAC). The proposed SAC seeks to add a
fourth cause of action for Defendant Volkswagen’s violations of the
Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. 
 
Plaintiff’s counsel submits a
compliant declaration in support of the motion. Plaintiff explains that on
February 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) in order to
remedy a clerical error (the original Complaint omitted the Negligent Repair
Cause of Action against Defendant Audi Fletcher Jones). In the weeks following
the submission of the FAC, counsel re-evaluated the FAC to determine if any
potentially viable causes of action or theories of liability had not been pled.
As a result of this analysis, Plaintiff determined the complaint could have
included a claim for violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. 
 
            This
explanation shows that the proposed amendment is based on the same exact set of
facts previously alleged. (See Compl. ¶¶ 7, 19 & FAC ¶¶ 8, 31.) Thus, the
record demonstrates that Plaintiff delayed in bringing this legal theory, even
though she could have brought this theory with the initial complaint. That
said, any delay was insubstantial. This action is still in its infancy.
Plaintiff initiated this action less than six months before requesting leave to
amend. Moreover, there is no evidence that Defendant could possibly be
prejudiced by this brief delay. Since
Plaintiff’s delay was not prejudicial, the motion cannot be denied due to the
delay.
 
Accordingly, the motion for leave to amend is
GRANTED. The Court will address any substantive inadequacies with the SAC upon
a procedurally proper motion, such as a demurrer or motion for judgment on the
pleadings.
