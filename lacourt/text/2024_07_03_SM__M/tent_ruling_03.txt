MOTION:                  Motion
to Compel Release of Funds from Escrow
HEARING DATE:   7/3/2024

 
Analysis
 
Plaintiff Xenon Investment Group
moves for an order “authorizing Xenon to withdraw funds from Escrow Number:
[Redacted]03-SR in the amount of $21,200.” Xenon notices no authority for such
an order or motion, beyond a generic citation to the court’s inherent powers.
(CCP §128.) The Court interprets this as an improper motion for summary
judgment or adjudication. Notably, the complaint requests this very relief: for
an order directing Secured Trust Escrow to release the $31,500 deposited by
Xenon back to Xenon as to the first cause of action for breach of contract.
(Compl., ¶¶ 16, 23; Prayer.) Plaintiff thus seeks adjudication of a cause of
action in their complaint upon a noticed motion. Plaintiff has met none of the
procedural requirements for summary adjudication, such as observing the jurisdictional
notice period or providing a separate statement. (CCP § 437c.)
 
Alternatively, the Court interprets
this as an improper motion for enforcement of a settlement agreement. (CCP §
664.6.) Plaintiffs assert that a stipulated judgment already exists, but they
have not moved for enforcement in the underlying action. Plaintiffs have otherwise
not shown entitlement to judgment under a summary section 664.6 proceeding. 
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
