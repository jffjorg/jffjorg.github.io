The Judge's tentative ruling in the case of Sheriff v. LAC-MTA, et al. (Case No. 23SMCV03679) concerns a motion by the defendants for leave to file a compulsory cross-complaint against the Plaintiff. The defendants claim that they have discovered a video that reveals the Plaintiff's Uber passenger caused the accident by opening the rear door of the Plaintiff's vehicle into the lane of the passing bus. The motion is unopposed and the Judge finds no bad faith apparent from the record. Therefore, the motion is granted and the defendant is ordered to file the cross-complaint within 5 days. The Judge's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) sections 428.50(a), (c) and 426.50, as well as case law, including Silver Organizations Ltd. v. Frank (1990), Foot's Transfer & Storage Co. v. Superior Court (1980), and Sidney v. Superior Court (1988).
