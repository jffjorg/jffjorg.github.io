This tentative ruling addresses a motion filed by Xenon Investment Corp. (Plaintiff) to compel the release of funds from escrow in the amount of $21,200. The Court concludes that the motion is improper, either as a motion for summary judgment or as a motion to enforce a settlement agreement. The Plaintiff had not met the procedural requirements for summary adjudication, and the Court finds that the Plaintiff has not shown entitlement to judgment under a summary proceeding. As a result, the motion is denied.
