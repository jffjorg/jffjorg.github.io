Summary:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a demurrer to a complaint filed by the Heeke family against Golden Empire Nursing & Rehab Center LP, Susan Claydon, FNP, and Christopher Claydon, M.D., Inc. The demurrer argues that the complaint does not state a cause of action for elder abuse and neglect. The court concludes that the complaint fails to allege that the Claydon Defendants failed to provide hydration as a basic need, but rather alleges that they failed to provide appropriate hydration as medical care. The court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend and grants the motion to strike the claims for attorneys' fees and punitive damages.
