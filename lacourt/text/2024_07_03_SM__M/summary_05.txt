And here is the English summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to amend to file a second amended complaint. The plaintiff, April Whitton, seeks to add a fourth cause of action for the defendant's violations of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. The judge has granted the motion, finding that the proposed amendment is based on the same facts previously alleged and that the delay in bringing the legal theory was insubstantial and did not prejudice the defendant. The judge notes that the action is still in its infancy, and the plaintiff initiated the action less than six months before requesting leave to amend. The judge will address any substantive inadequacies with the second amended complaint upon a procedurally proper motion, such as a demurrer or motion for judgment on the pleadings.
