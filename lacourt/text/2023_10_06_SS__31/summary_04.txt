```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint. The motion was filed on July 12, 2023, but CCP ยง435 requires that a motion to strike must be made within the time allowed to respond to a pleading. Since the defendant responded to the plaintiff's complaint by filing an answer, the defendant may not now bring a motion to strike after the timeframe to do so has long expired. The judge orders the defendant to give notice and encourages the parties to meet and confer to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit to this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" followed by the case number.
