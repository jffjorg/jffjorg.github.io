And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel discovery responses from the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to serve timely responses to the defendant's discovery requests, which were propounded on August 23, 2022, January 10, 2023, and February 6, 2023. The judge ordered the plaintiff to serve verified responses to the defendant's special interrogatories, set two, and request for production of documents, set two, without objections, within 20 days. The judge also awarded the defendant sanctions in the amount of $800 for the plaintiff's failure to serve timely responses. The judge noted that the motion to compel request for production of documents, set three, is moot since responses were served prior to the hearing, but the defendant may schedule an informal discovery conference to elicit further responses.
