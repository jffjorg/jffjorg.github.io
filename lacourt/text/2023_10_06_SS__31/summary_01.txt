And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to undergo a second neurological examination. The examination is necessary because the plaintiff claims to have suffered a headache and neurological condition as a result of a motor vehicle incident. The defendant argues that the plaintiff intends to present a neurological injury case and that the parties had agreed to meet and confer to schedule the examination, but the plaintiff's counsel failed to respond. The judge finds good cause for the examination and notes that the defendant has met its obligation to specify the scope of the examination. However, the judge is concerned that the proposed examination date of October 10, 2023 is insufficient notice to the plaintiff and orders the defendant to reschedule the examination with at least 10 days' notice. The judge also orders the parties to meet and confer to determine the date and time for the examination.
