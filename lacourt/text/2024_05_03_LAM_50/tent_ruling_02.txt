[1]It appears Plaintiff is referring to the Court’s May
26, 2022 minute order. Plaintiff’s motion also states that “[t]his motion will
be made on the grounds that Defendant failed to comply with this Court’s May
26, 2022 IDC Discovery Order…” (Notice of Mot. at p. 2:10-12.) 


[2]Plaintiff asserts that
“Defense counsel sent the email of
Exhibit 6 clearly illustrating defense counsel and his client’s blatant
disregard for the Court’s Orders.” (Mot. at p. 3:19-20.) The Court finds Defendant’s
counsel’s email set forth in Exhibit 6 to Plaintiff’s counsel’s declaration to
be unprofessional. The Court calls to the attention of Defendant’s counsel Los
Angeles Superior Court Local Rule 3.26 which
provides, “[t]he guidelines adopted by
the Los Angeles County Bar Association are adopted as civility in litigation
recommendations to members of the bar, and are contained in Appendix 3.A.”
Appendix 3.A(d)(1) provides that “[c]ounsel should at all times be civil and
courteous in communicating with adversaries, whether in writing or orally.” 


[3]The Court notes that the requested “issue and evidentiary
sanctions” do not appear to be discussed in Plaintiff’s notice of motion or in
the memorandum of points and authorities in support of the motion. 
 


[4]As discussed, “[m]isuses
of the discovery process include, but are not limited to…(g) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010, subd. (g).)
