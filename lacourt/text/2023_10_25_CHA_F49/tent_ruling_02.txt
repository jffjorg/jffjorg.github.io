SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
Homenetmen Western Region contends defendant Nonprofits Insurance Alliance of
California wrongfully denied a claim related to business interruptions caused
by the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent government orders from various
government agencies, including the City of Los Angeles and State of California.
 
On
December 18, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Breach of Contract, Breach
of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, Unfair Business Practices Business
and Professions Code 17200, Unjust Enrichment, Negligent Misrepresentation, and
Declaratory Relief. On April 25, 2023, the court sustained the demurrer to the
complaint with 30 days leave to amend. On May 26, 2023, Plaintiff filed a first
amended complaint for Breach of Contract, Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and
Fair Dealing, Negligent Misrepresentation, and Declaratory Relief.
 
RULING: Continued to
November 20, 2023.
Defendant
Nonprofits Insurance Alliance of California submits a demurrer to the entire first
amended complaint. As of the date of the tentative ruling publication cutoff,
the court shows no opposition on file via the court electronic filing system,
though an opposition was apparently served given the substatntive arguments in
reply.
 
The
court therefore continues the hearing to November 20, 2023. Plaintiff is
ordered to file the exact opposition and any other items served on Defendant
for the instant hearing no later than 14 calendar days before the next hearing
date—November 6, 2023. The court will consider the reply on file. The parties
are NOT granted leave to submit a revised opposition or reply.
 
Defendant to give notice.
