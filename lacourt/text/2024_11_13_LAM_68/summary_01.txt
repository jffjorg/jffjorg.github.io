And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied, without prejudice, the plaintiff's motion to lift the stay and leave to file a first amended complaint. The plaintiff had requested to lift the stay and file an amended complaint to remove all individual claims and proceed solely in a representative capacity. The judge noted that the motion lacked sufficient address of the proposed amended complaint and failed to comply with the requirements set forth in California Rules of Court Rule 3.1324. Additionally, the judge found that the motion was procedurally incomplete and that the proposed amendment would result in prejudice to the opposing parties. The judge also declined to consider any late-submitted arguments in the reply and denied the motion on all grounds. The case remains stayed, and a post-arbitration status conference is currently set for July 15, 2025.
