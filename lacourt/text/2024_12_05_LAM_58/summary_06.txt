And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to set aside the entry of default and default judgment. The plaintiff, Jose Meza Torres, filed a complaint against the defendant, CBW Doors Inc., alleging FEHA discrimination and wage and hour violations. The defendant moved to set aside the default judgment, arguing that it exceeded the amount demanded in the complaint and that the plaintiff failed to serve a notice of intent to obtain punitive damages before the default judgment was entered.

The judge found that the default judgment did indeed exceed the amount demanded in the complaint and that the plaintiff failed to serve the required notice. The judge also found that the entry of default judgment violated the defendant's due process rights. As a result, the judge granted the defendant's motion and set the date for a responsive pleading from the defendant.
