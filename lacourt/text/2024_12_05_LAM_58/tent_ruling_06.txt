This is FEHA
discrimination and wage and hour case. On December 27, 2023, Jose Meza Torres (Plaintiff)
filed a Complaint against his former employer CBW Doors Inc. (Defendant),
alleging several violations of California Labor Codes. Plaintiff was hired by
Defendant as a carpenter in July 2022 and alleges he was wrongfully terminated
on February 1, 2023. (Compl., ¶11.) In January of 2023, Plaintiff was involved
in an automobile accident, and informed Defendants of his injuries. (Compl.,
¶18.) Plaintiff later discovered his wife was pregnant and requested days off
to transport his wife to various doctor’s appointments. (Id.) On
February 1, 2023, Plaintiff informed his supervisor that he had a doctor
appointment at 10:30am and would be in to work afterwards. Less than three
hours later, Plaintiff’s supervisor informed Plaintiff he was terminated.
Plaintiff then filed suit.
 
On December 27,
2023, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant CBW for: (1–2)
actual/perceived disability discrimination and retaliation in violation of the
California Fair Employment and Housing Act (“FEHA”); (3) failure to engage in
the mandatory good-faith interactive process; (4) failure to accommodate; (5)
failure to pay wages; (6) waiting time penalties; (7) failure to provide meal
and rest periods; (8) unfair business practices; (9) wrongful termination and
retaliation in violation of public policy; and (10) failure to provide employee
personnel files. 
 
No Answer was
filed. On April 18, 2024, the Court entered default against Defendant CBW.
Then, on September 16, 2024, the Court entered
default judgment against Defendant CBW. 
 
On October 31,
2024, Defendant CBW Doors Inc. moved to set aside the April 18, 2024 entry of
default and the September 16, 2024 default judgment against it. Plaintiff
opposed the motion.  
 
The motion to set
aside the default judgment is granted. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant CBW moves
to set aside the entry of default and default judgment on the grounds that the default
judgment exceeds the amount demanded in the Complaint in violation of Code of
Civil Procedure section 580.
 
A default judgment “cannot exceed that demanded in the complaint.” (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 580, 585, subds. (a), (b).) “[A] default judgment greater than
the amount specifically demanded is void as beyond the [trial] court's
jurisdiction.” (Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 826, [italics
added].) For example, a prayer for relief “in excess of” a specified dollar
amount will result in a default award of no more than that amount. (Traci
& Marx Co. v. Legal Options, Inc. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th
155, 160.) 
 
            Except in certain cases, “courts
must look to the prayer of the complaint or to ‘allegations in the body
of the complaint of the damages sought’ to determine whether a defendant has
been informed of the ‘maximum liability’ he or she will face for choosing to
default.” (People ex rel. Lockyer v. Brar (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 659,
667.)
 
Here, the Complaint contains no dollar amount of the damages sought.
Nonetheless, the Court entered judgment in the amount of $197,002.52, with
damages set at $183,190. This amount exceeds the amount sought in the
Complaint. 
 
Further, on August 22, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Intent to
obtain punitive damages in the amount of $100,000, pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 425.115.
 
As noted above, under section 580, subdivision (a), “[t]he relief
granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot exceed that demanded in
the complaint ....” 
 
However, “where an action is brought to recover actual or punitive
damages for personal injury or wrongful death, the amount demanded shall not be
stated” in the complaint. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.10, subd. (b).) Rather, a
“plaintiff preserves the right to seek punitive damages pursuant to Section
3294 of the Civil Code on a default judgment by serving upon the defendant” a
notice consistent with the requirements set forth in section 425.115,
subdivision (b). (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.115, subd. (b); Code Civ. Proc., §
580, subd. (a) [default judgment cannot exceed relief demanded in § 425.115
statement].) Subdivision (f) states that “[t]he plaintiff shall serve the
statement upon the defendant pursuant to this section before a default may be
taken, if the motion for default judgment includes a request for punitive
damages.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.115, subd. (f).)
 
Here, the Notice of Intent to obtain punitive damages in the amount of
$100,000, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section was served after
entry of default against Defendant CBW. As such, the entry of default judgment
in amount that included these punitive damages violated Defendant’s due process
rights. (See Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 826.)
 
In opposition, Plaintiff
argues that Defendant’s motion should be denied because Defendant failed to set
forth sufficient evidence of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, and/or excusable
neglect required to justify setting aside entry of default against Defendant
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). This argument
is misplaced where Defendant’s motion is based on the argument that entry of
default and default judgment are void for the reasons set forth above.
 
“The question of whether a judgment is void is typically framed as a
question of whether the court rendering the judgment lacked jurisdiction.” (Grados
v. Shiau (2021) 63 Cal.App.5th 1042, 1050 (Grados).) “ ‘[Q]uestions
of jurisdiction are never waived and may be raised for the first time on
appeal.’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.)
 
Plaintiff also argues that the motion fails to comply with Code of
Civil Procedure section 473.5, subdivision (b). 
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 473.5(b) specifically states that the motion “shall be
accompanied by an affidavit showing under oath that the party's lack of actual
notice in time to defend the action was not caused by his or her avoidance of
service or inexcusable neglect.” 
 
However, this
statute only applies to instances where “service of a
summons has not resulted in actual notice to a party in time to defend the
action and a default or default judgment has been entered against him or her in
the action, he or she may serve and file a notice of motion to set aside the
default or default judgment and for leave to defend the action.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473.5.)
 
Again, Defendant
is not seeking relief based on this statute. 
 
Finally, Plaintiff
argues because Defendant only seeks to set aside the entry of default judgment
and not the entry of default; Plaintiff argues that leaving the entry of
default in place renders the relief sought by Defendant effectively an “idle
act.” 
 
As a preliminary
matter, Defendant expressly seeks to set aside the entry of default, not onlly
entry of default judgment. (Mot., 1-2.) Moreover, even if Plaintiff were
correct, Plaintiff would not be entitled any monetary relief even if the
default remained, given the defects identified by Defendant. 
 
In Howard Greer Custom Originals v. Capritti (1950) 35 Cal.2d 886, the court explained that “[t]he setting
aside and vacating the judgment alone, which was all the relief sought in said
motion, would have been an idle act, because the default . . . would have stood
undisturbed. The default cut off defendants from making any further opposition
or objection to the relief which plaintiff's complaint shows he is entitled to
demand.” (Id. at 888.) Thus, the court in Howard Greer Custom Originals, determined that
even if it vacated the default judgement against the defendant, the
defendant would still be in default, and the court would have to “render
another judgement of like effect.” (Id.) This is
because “[a] default judgment fatally deficient for award of excess relief may
be set aside without vitiating the defendant's default.” (Jonson v.
Weinstein (1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 954, 958.) For example, when a judgment is
rendered void for granting excess relief, an appellate court may modify the
judgment to the maximum amount warranted or direct the trial court to vacate
the portion of the award that is excessive. (Ostling v. Loring (1994) 27
Cal.App.4th 1731, 1744; 311 South Spring Street Co. v. Department of General
Services (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 1009, 1019.)
 
Here, however,
where the Complaint sets forth no amount and the punitive damages were only sought
by statement of damages after default was entered, the resulting adjustment
would be zero. Therefore, leaving the default in place provides no monetary
relief to Plaintiff. 
 
Conclusion
 
            The motion to set aside the default
judgment is granted.  At the hearing the
Court will set the date for a responsive pleading from Defendant.
