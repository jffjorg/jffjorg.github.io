And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting a motion to amend a judgment. The Plaintiff, Aida Shahbandeh Masihi, loaned $400,000 to the Defendants, who never provided written loan documents and failed to repay the loan. The Plaintiff filed a Complaint and the Defendants filed an answer, but the Court struck the answer of one of the Companies. The Court then entered a judgment against the Companies for $500,000. The Plaintiff later filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) and default was entered against two of the Defendants. The Court granted the Plaintiff's motion for default judgment and then granted a motion to amend the judgment to correct clerical errors in the spelling of two of the Defendants' names. The Judge noted that the challenged portion of the judgment was entered inadvertently and therefore is a clerical error that can be corrected.
