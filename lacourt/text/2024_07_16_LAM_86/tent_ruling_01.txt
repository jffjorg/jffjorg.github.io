[TENTATIVE] RULING ON VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT
  OF MANDATE
 
Dept. 86 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 




 


 


 


 



Petitioners
The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Los Angeles and Archdiocese of Los Angeles
Education & Welfare Corporation (collectively, “Archdiocese” or “ADLA”)
petitions for a writ of mandate directing respondent Los Angeles Unified School
District (“LAUSD” or “District”) to produce records related to LAUSD’s funding
of ADLA’s educational services in compliance with Title I of the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act. 
 
I.       Factual Background
 
A.            
Statutory
Background
 
Under
Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, 20 U.S.C. § 6320, et
seq., as amended by the 2015 Every Student Succeeds Act (“ESSA”), federal
educational grants are provided to local educational agencies (“LEAs”) in order
to “provide all children significant opportunity to receive a fair, equitable, and
high-quality education, and to close educational achievement gaps” by funding services
such as instructional services, counseling, mentoring, one-on-one tutoring, and
intervention services for neglected, delinquent, or at-risk children. (20
U.S.C. §§ 6301, 6320(a)(1)(A), 6333, 6421(b).) Title I requires each LEA
to dedicate a portion of its grant to provide educational services to eligible
students residing in the LEA’s school attendance area who attend nonprofit
private schools. (20 U.S.C. § 6320(a)(1)(A).) Before providing Title I
services to eligible private school students, the LEA shall engage in “timely
and meaningful consultation with appropriate private school officials” to
determine “how to provide equitable and effective programs for eligible private
school children.” (20 U.S.C. §§ 6320(a)(1), (b)(1), (b)(3).) Issues discussed
during the consultation shall include “the method or sources of data that are
used…to determine the number of children from low-income families in participating
school attendance areas who attend private schools,” as well as whether to “pool”
funds allocated to all children from low-income families attending private
schools or whether to provide equitable services on a “proportional” basis, as
defined in the statute. (20 U.S.C. § 6320(b)(1)(F), (b)(1)(J).) 
 
            “Expenditures for educational
services and other benefits to eligible private school children” made pursuant
to Title I “shall be equal to the proportion of funds allocated to
participating school attendance areas based on the number of children from
low-income families who attend private schools.” (20 U.S.C. § 6320(a)(4).) For
purposes of this calculation, the LEA must calculate the number of children,
ages 5 through 17, who are from low-income families and attend private schools
according
to one
of the exclusive methodologies set forth in 20 U.S.C. § 6320(c)(1).            
 
            ADLA alleges that during the 2017-2018 through the
2019-2020 school years, the District failed to consult with the relevant school
officials before changing the methodology for counting the number of eligible
low-income ADLA students who are residents of the LAUSD school attendance area.
(Pet. ¶ 11.) The change in methodology purportedly resulted in less funding to
ADLA. (Pet. ¶¶ 13, 15, 16.)
 
B.            
ADLA
Submits Three Sets of CPRA Requests to District
 
On
August 23, 2019, ADLA submitted its first set of requests under the California
Public Records Act (“CPRA”) to LAUSD. (Wenkart Decl. ¶ 2 & Ex. A.) The
District responded to the first CPRA request on September 27, 2019 and January
24, 2020. (Turner Decl. ¶¶ 10-13 & Exs. 1, 2.)
 
On
July 22, 2020, ADLA submitted its second set of CPRA requests to LAUSD.
(Wenkart Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. G.) On August 17, 2020, the District sent a letter
to ADLA’s outside counsel, providing an estimated response date of October 2,
2020. (Wenkart Decl. ¶ 6 & Ex. I.) Later in August 2020, ADLA’s outside
counsel and the District engaged in email communication, in which ADLA provided
clarifying information in response to the District’s questions. (Wenkart Decl.
¶ 7 & Ex. J.) 
 
On November 15, 2021,
ADLA submitted its third set of CPRA requests in a letter to LAUSD. (Wenkart
Decl. ¶ 9 & Exh. K.) Along with setting forth new CPRA requests, ADLA’s
counsel stated that no response had yet been provided to the first two sets of
CPRA requests. (Wenkart Decl. ¶ 9 & Exh. K.) 
 
The
District did not provide any substantive response to the second and
third sets of requests and did not produce any requested records before the Petition
for Writ of Mandate was filed in this matter on December 16, 2021. (Wenkart
Decl. ¶¶ 3, 8, 10.)
C.          
ADLA Files Petition for
Writ of Mandate
 
On December 16, 2021,
ADLA filed the Petition. (Troy Decl. ¶ 8 & Ex. L.) The first six causes of
action contained in the Petition were causes of action relating to actions,
events and omissions that were the subject of the three sets of CPRA requests.
The seventh cause of action was for a petition for writ of mandate compelling
LAUSD to perform its duty under then-Government Code section 6250 et seq. (subsequently
renumbered as Government Code section 7920.000 et seq.) to provide a
prompt and legally sufficient responses to ADLA’s Public Records Act requests.
(Pet. ¶¶ 157-162 and Prayer for Relief ¶ 6.)
 
D.          
District Produces
Documents
 
After ADLA filed the
Petition, LAUSD produced to ADLA what it designated as a “First Production” on
February 18, 2022 (Wenkart Decl. ¶ 11 & Ex. M); what it designated as a
Second Production of documents on April 7, 2022 (Wenkart Decl. ¶ 12 & Ex.
N); what it designated as the Third Production of documents on April 29, 2022
(Wenkart Decl., ¶ 13 & Ex. O); what it designated as the Fourth Production
of documents on January 31, 2023 (Wenkart Decl. ¶ 14 & Ex. P); and what it
designated as the Fifth and Final Production on April 12, 2023 (Wenkart Decl. ¶
15 & Ex. Q). 
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            Petitioners
filed the operative Verified
Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive
Relief on December 16, 2021.
 
            On April 20, 2022, the Court (Hon.
Douglas W. Stern, presiding) sustained respondents’ demurrer to the Petition
for Writ of Mandate without leave to amend. On June 9, 2022, Judge Stern revised
the April 20, 2022 ruling. Judge Stern sustained the demurrer to the first six
causes of action without leave to amend and made no ruling with respect to the
seventh cause of action seeking writ of mandate under the California Public
Records Act. On June 20, 2023, the instant case was reassigned to this Court to
adjudicate the seventh cause of action. 
 
            On
April 12, 2024, ADLA filed an opening brief. On May 10, 2024, the District filed
an opposition. On May 28, 2024, ADLA filed a reply. The Court has received an
electronic copy of the administrative record and a hard copy of the joint
appendix. 
 
III.     Standard of Review
 
Pursuant to the CPRA,
individual citizens have a right to access government records. In enacting the
CPRA, the California Legislature declared that “access to information
concerning the conduct of the people's business is a fundamental and necessary
right of every person in this state.” (Gov. Code § 7921.000; see also
Cal. Const. Art. I, Sec. 3(b); County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (2012)
211 Cal.App.4th 57, 63.) 
 
“[E]very person has a
right to inspect any public record” of a state or local agency subject to
statutory exemptions. (Gov. Code § 7922.530(a); see also Gov. Code §
7920.510(h) [definition of “local agency” includes agent of a city].) The
California Constitution mandates that the CPRA be “broadly construed,” while
any statute “that limits the right of access” must be “narrowly construed.” (See
Cal. Const. Art. I, Sec. 3(b)(2); see also Nat’l Lawyers Guild v. City
of Hayward (2020) 9 Cal.5th 488, 507.) The CPRA “does not allow limitations
on access to a public record based upon the purpose for which the record is
being requested, if the record is otherwise subject to disclosure.” (Gov. Code
§ 7921.300.)
 
“Any person may institute
a proceeding…for a writ of mandate…to enforce that person’s right…to inspect or
receive a copy of any public record or class of public records.” (Gov. Code §
7923.000.) “To establish an agency has a duty to disclose under [the CPRA], the
petitioner must show that: (1) the record ‘qualif[ies] as [a] ‘public record[
]’ …; and (2) the record is ‘in the possession of the agency.’” (Anderson-Barker
v Sup.Ct. (2019) 31 Cal.App.5th 528, 538.) “Whether a record falls within
the statutory definition of a ‘public record’ involves a ‘distinct inquiry’
from whether the agency is in possession of that record…. The duty to disclose
applies only when the petitioner has satisfied both elements.” (Id. at
539.) 
 
CPRA exemptions must be
narrowly construed, and the agency bears the burden of showing that a specific
exemption applies. (Sacramento County Employees’ Retirement System v.
Superior Court (2013) 195 Cal.App.4th 440, 453.) A public agency also has
the burden to demonstrate that it properly withheld records on the grounds they
are non-responsive to a CPRA request or do not constitute public records. (ACLU
of Northern Cal. v. Sup. Ct. (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 55, 83-86.) ““Because
the agency has full knowledge of the contents of the withheld records and the
requester has only the agency's affidavits and descriptions of the documents,
its affidavits must be specific enough to give the requester ‘a meaningful
opportunity to contest’ the withholding of the documents.” (Id. at 83.) 
 
IV.     Analysis
 
A.          
Evidentiary
Matters
 
The
District’s evidentiary objections to the declaration of Kevin Troy are
OVERRULED. Pursuant to Evidence Code § 1523(d), counsel for ADLA is entitled to
aver to the “general result of the whole,” specifically what the documents
referenced by the District do not contain, as examination of the documents by
the Court would cause a great loss of time. While secondary evidence must
comply with the hearsay rule (Dart Industries, Inc. v. Commercial Union Ins.
Co. (2002) 28 Cal.4th 1059, 1070, fn. 2), counsel for ADLA’s averments are
not inadmissible hearsay. Counsel is not averring to any statement in the
documents referenced by the District but rather what statements are not in the
referenced documents. (See Evid. Code § 1200(a) [defining “hearsay
evidence” as “evidence of a statement that was made other than by a witness
while testifying at the hearing and that is offered to prove the truth of the
matter stated”].) In any event, any
evidentiary defect was cured by ADLA filing the referenced documents with the
reply. (See Troy Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 3-7 & Exs. W-AA.) 
 
ADLA’s objections to the
declaration of Rita Gail Turner are OVERRULED.
 
B.          
Merits
 
1.           
First Request (August
23, 2019)
 
In the moving papers, ADLA
sought to compel production of Request No. 2, which sought “[a]ll budget
documents and related information showing the cost of Title I services provided
to the Archdiocese’s students for the past three years [2016-19].” (Opening Br.
at 14:12.) In the opposition, the District asserted that they responded to this
request on September 27, 2019 and January 24, 2020. (Opp. at 6:10-17; Turner
Decl. ¶¶ 9-13 & Ex. 1-2.) In the reply, ADLA withdrew the request. (Reply at
2:6-8.) Accordingly, the Court does not rule on ADLA’s first CPRA request.
 
2.           
Second Request (July
22, 2020)
 
From ADLA’s July 22, 2020
request, ADLA seeks to compel Request Nos. 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 14. (Opening
Br. at 14:13-14; see Wenkart
Decl. ¶ 4 & Ex. G.)
 
Request Nos. 2, 3, 7, 10,
11, and 14 request the following:
 
2. Any and all records,
documents, correspondence, e-mails and other information related to LAUSD’s
internal discussions related to the Archdiocese of Los Angeles’ (ADLA) request
for push-in as opposed to pull-out services since July 1, 2018.
 
3. Any and all records,
documents, correspondence, e-mails, and other information related to the names,
years of experience, prior assignments, and qualifications of teachers assigned
to programs operated by the ADLA, including, but not limited to, a roster of teachers
assigned to ADLA for the past four school years [2016-20]
 
7. Any and all records,
documents, correspondence, e-mails, and other information related to the
mailing of a survey to parents of ADLA students in the last year, including,
but not limited to, a list of the correspondence returned to LAUSD, and the
reasons the correspondence was returned by the U.S. Postal Service.
 
10. Any and all records,
documents, correspondence, e-mails, and other information related to LAUSD’s
development and distribution of the survey LAUSD developed to send to the
parents of ADLA students.
 
11. Any and all records,
documents, correspondence, e-mails, and other information related to LAUSD’s
internal discussions related to the ADLA’s proposed survey to determine Title I
eligibility and LAUSD’s rejection of the ADLA’s proposed survey.
 
14. Any and all records,
documents, correspondence, e-mails, and other information related to the filing
of LAUSD’s consolidated applications for Title I funds with the California Department
of Education (CDE).
            
As a preliminary matter,
it is undisputed that the records requested by ADLA are public records.
 
With respect to Request
Nos. 2, 3, 7, 10, 11, and 14, through which ADLA seeks internal
communications, the District opposes the requests based on the following
arguments: 1) the District produced internal communications within its
responsive records, 2) internal communications are subject to the
attorney-client privilege, and 3) ADLA did not file copies of the District’s
production so that the Court can determine whether internal communications were
omitted.
 
            Regarding the third argument, it is without merit for the
reasons stated in section IV.A, supra. 
 
            Regarding the first argument, the District does not argue
that it is not in possession of responsive documents. (See Turner Decl.
¶ 43 [“As to all other categories of records sought in Mr. Wenkart’s CPRA
request dated July 22, 2020, LAUSD has produced all responsive non-exempt
public records known to exist
within the District’s
custody and control”]; Opp. at 12:4-6.) Instead, the District argues that Exhibits
B, D, E, F, S, and T in support of ADLA’s opening brief are responsive internal
communications. (Turner Decl. ¶¶ 44, 45.) However, these exhibits were produced
in response to other requests. Exhibit B (Bates number PRA 2148-49) does not
appear to be an internal communication but rather communications between ADLA’s
counsel and a representative from the District. (Troy Decl. ¶ 3 & Ex. B.)
In any event, the District produced Exhibit B in response to Request No. 6.
(Wenkart Decl. ¶ 15 & Ex. Q, #6.) Exhibit D (PRA 6632-33), Exhibit E (PRA
6653-54), Exhibit F (PRA 7012-16), and Exhibit T (PRA 6467) were produced in
response to Request No. 9. (Troy Decl. ¶¶ 5-7, 18 & Exs. D-F, T; Wenkart
Decl. ¶ 15 & Ex. Q, #9.) Exhibit S (PRA 15059, 15060) was produced in
response to Request Nos. 13 and 15. (Troy Decl. ¶ 17 & Ex. S; Wenkart Decl.
¶ 15 & Ex. Q, #13, 15.) The District cannot rely on records produced in
response to other requests to claim that it complied with Request Nos. 2, 3, 7,
10, 11, and 14. ADLA cannot be expected to decipher which documents are
responsive to certain other requests, especially when the District’s responses
to each of ADLA’s CPRA requests identified by Bates number the documents that
it contends are responsive. (Wenkart Decl. ¶¶ 11-15 & Exs. M-Q.) 
 
            Regarding the second argument, the District asserts that,
because the parties were engaged in Uniform Complaint Procedures (“UCP”) proceedings
concerning the District’s Title I funding for ADLA students (see Petition
Ex. A; Turner Decl. ¶ 24), “LAUSD’s Office of General Counsel was almost
certainly involved in many of the very same internal discussions sought in
ADLA’s CPRA requests, thereby rendering such records attorney-client communications
exempt from disclosure.” (Opp. at 12:7-16.) However, it is the District’s
burden under the CPRA to “describe the justification for nondisclosure with
reasonably specific detail and demonstrate that the information withheld is
within the claimed privilege or exemption.” (Golden Door Properties, LLC v.
Superior Court (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 733, 790.) “Declarations supporting
the agency’s claim of exemption ‘“must be specific enough to give the requester
“a meaningful opportunity to contest” the withholding of the documents and the
court to determine whether the exemption applies.”’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.,
citing ACLU, 202 Cal.App.4th at 83.) The District invokes the
possibility that documents responsive to Request Nos. 2, 3, 7, 10, 11, and 14 are
privileged without providing any evidence supporting this assertion. (See
generally Turner Decl.; Hebberd-Kulow Enterprises, Inc. v. Kelomar, Inc.
(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 272, 283 [“An attorney's argument in pleadings is not
evidence”].) The District does not meet its burden to demonstrate that
responsive documents are exempted from production.
 
            For the foregoing reasons, the Court will order the
District to produce all records responsive to Request Nos. 2, 3, 7, 10, 11, and
14. To the extent that documents that the District previously produced are
responsive to these requests, the District may specify the Bates numbers of any
such documents in responding to the requests. 
 
            ADLA also seeks an order for the District to produce
records responsive to Request No. 8, which asks for “[a]ny and all
records, documents, correspondence, e-mails, and other information related to
the ineligibility of ADLA students for the 2019-20 and 2020-21 school years,
including, but not limited to a list of the names of parents and students,
addresses, and schools of attendance, of students found ineligible for Title I
services.” The District declined to produce records responsive to Request No. 8
pursuant to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”). (Wenkart
Decl. ¶¶ 13-15 & Exs. O-Q, #8.)  
 
Under FERPA, educational
agencies which have a policy or practice of releasing “any personally
identifiable information in education records other than directory information”
are prohibited from receiving federal funds unless the information “is
furnished in compliance with judicial order, or pursuant to any lawfully issued
subpoena, upon condition that parents and the students are notified of all such
orders or subpoenas in advance of the compliance therewith by the educational
institution or agency.” (20 U.S.C. § 1232g(b)(2)(B).)[1] As
phrased in the statute, FERPA “imposes a financial penalty for the unauthorized
disclosure of educational records.” (Ellis v. Cleveland Municipal School
Dist. (N.D. Ohio 2004) 309 F.Supp.2d 1019, 1023.) “FERPA is not a law which
absolutely prohibits the disclosure of educational records.” (Ibid.)
Moreover, FERPA was designed to ‘address systematic, not individual, violations
of students’ privacy by unauthorized releases of sensitive information in their
educational records.’” (Ibid.) FERPA’s focus on “policies which
systematically invade a student's privacy is thus consistent with the statute's
allowances for the disclosure of such information in particular circumstances
or pursuant to a court order on a case-by-case basis.” (Id. at 1023-24.)

 
Accordingly, FERPA is not
a statutory exemption which would prohibit respondent from producing responsive
documents. By complying with Request No. 8, the District would not be acting in
accordance with any policy or practice. Rather, the District would be
responding to a public records request as required under the CPRA. Therefore, the
District fail to satisfy their burden to demonstrate a statutory exemption to
the CPRA. (Sacramento County, 195 Cal.App.4th at 453 [“Creating a
general right of access subject to exemptions places the burden on the agency
to show that a particular public record is exempt from disclosure”].) 
 
            Because FERPA does not pose a barrier to production of
documents that are responsive to Request No. 8, the Court need not address ADLA’s
alternative arguments that the District improperly withheld documents in whole
instead of redacting potentially redactable information and that the District interpreted
the request to include only documents with potentially redactable information.
(See Opening Br. at 9:19-20:4.) 
 
            ADLA also seeks an order for the District to produce
records responsive to Request No. 9, which asks for “[a]ny and all
records, documents, correspondence, e-mails, and other information related to
LAUSD’s budget for the Title I program, including, but not limited to, the
apportionment of administrative overhead among the various components of the
Title I program, including LAUSD schools and private schools, including, but
not limited to ADLA schools.” ADLA argues that the documents that the District identified
by Bates number (PRA 3257 through 14591) as responsive to Request No. 9 do not
pertain to the District’s Title I budget or at most contain a tangential
reference to Title I. (Troy Decl. ¶ 15; Troy Supp. Decl. ¶ 7 & Ex. AA.) ADLA
also argues that the budgets are not easily identifiable within the District’s
referenced documents because the District produced emails without the
accompanying attachments. (Troy Decl. ¶¶ 15, 16.) The District did not address
these arguments in its opposition. For example, the District did not cite
specific Bates numbers and explain how the documents it produced are responsive
to Request No. 9. 
 
On the face of Request
No. 9, budgets, documents related to budgets, and attachments corresponding to
emails are within the District’s control. (See, e.g., Getz v. Superior Court
(2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 637, 660 [ordering production of emails and attachments
under CPRA].) The District does not meet its burden to demonstrate that an
exemption to the CPRA applies, that the records which ADLA seeks are not
responsive to Request No. 9, or that the requested records are not public
records. (Sacramento County, 195 Cal.App.4th at 453; ACLU, 202
Cal.App.4th at 83-86.) 
 
For the foregoing
reasons, the District is ordered to produce records responsive to Request Nos. 2,
3, 7-11, and 14 contained in ADLA’s July
22, 2020 CPRA request. 
 
3.           
Third Request (November 15, 2021)
 
ADLA also petitions for
an order for the District to produce records responsive to Request Nos. 1-8 in ADLA’s
third CPRA request. Request Nos. 1-8 seek the following categories of records:
 
1. Any and all records,
documents, correspondence, e-mails, and other information related to LAUSD’s
response to the CDE Investigation Report, Case No. 2019-0271TM/2019-058CPM.
 
2. Any and all records,
documents, correspondence, e-mails, and other information related to LAUSD’s
modifications, changes, reforms, or improvements of LAUSD’s Title I program
since the CDE’s Investigation Report was issued.
 
3. Any and all records,
documents, correspondence, e-mails, and other information related to the
expenditure, use or transfer of Title I funds allocated to the ADLA since July
1, 2017, how these Title I funds were actually spent.
 
4. Any and all records,
documents, correspondence, e-mails, and other information related to the
transfer of teachers and other LAUSD staff from ADLA schools to other schools since
July 1, 2017.
 
5. Any and all records,
documents, correspondence, e-mails, and other information related to the
Corrective Action ordered by CDE in its Investigation Report.
 
6. Any and all records,
documents, correspondence, e-mails, and other information related to the
reduction in Title I funds allocated to the ADLA from July 1, 2017, to the
present.
 
7. Any and all records, documents, correspondence, e-mails, and other
information related to finding ADLA students ineligible for Title I services
since July 1, 2016.
 
8. Any and all records, documents, correspondence, e-mails, and other
information related to LAUSD’s responses, modifications, changes, reforms, or
improvements of LAUSD’s Title I program since the United States Department of
Education’s decision related to the Complaint filed by the
Bureau of Jewish Education (BJE).
 
(Wenkart Decl. ¶ 9 &
Exh. K.) The District argues that it never received ADLA’s third CPRA request. (Turner
Decl. ¶ 47.) The evidence presented by ADLA leads the Court to conclude the
contrary. The third CPRA request was contained in a letter to Grace Yeo, Assistant
General Counsel of the District in a letter dated November 15, 2021. (Wenkart
Decl. ¶ 9 & Exh. K.) The letter was emailed to Ms. Yeo at grace.yeo@lausd.net.
(Troy Supp. Decl. ¶ 8 & Ex. BB.) This is the same email address from which Ms.
Yeo sent emails to counsel for ADLA. (Troy Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 9-10 & Exs. CC,
DD.) Ms. Yeo was employed as an Assistant General Counsel for the District as
of November 15, 2021 and until November 2022. (Troy Supp. Decl. ¶ 11 & Ex.
EE.) 
 
The District asserts that
it is possible that it “simply missed” the third CPRA request because it was
contained on pages 3 and 4 of a letter which contained discussion of the first
and second CPRA requests. (Opp. at 13:7-9.) However, the email accompanying the
request clearly stated that a Public Records Act request was attached and that ADLA
has sent two prior Public Records Act requests in 2019 and 2020. (Wenkart Decl.
¶ 9 & Exh. K.) “[I]nternal logistical problems or general neglect of duties”
do not excuse the District’s failure to comply with the CPRA. (See Community
Youth Athletic Center v. City of National City (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1385,
1447 [finding petitioner may be entitled to attorney fees under CPRA despite
public agency’s failure to produce documents “due to its internal logistical
problems or general neglect of duties”].) 
 
In any event, the
District does not argue that an exemption applies to any of the categories of
records set forth in the third request. The District agrees to voluntary
respond. (Opp. at 13:13-14.) Accordingly, the District is ordered to produce
records responsive to Request Nos. 1-8 contained in ADLA’s November 15, 2021 CPRA request. 
 
4.           
Attorney Fees
 
ADLA seeks an award of attorney fees pursuant to
Government Code § 7923.115(a). “If the requester prevails in litigation filed
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall award court costs and reasonable
attorney’s fees to the requester.” (Gov. Code § 7923.115(a).)
 
“A
plaintiff is considered the prevailing party if his lawsuit motivated
defendants to provide the primary relief sought or activated them to modify
their behavior [citation], or if the litigation substantially contributed to or
was demonstrably influential in setting in motion the process which eventually
achieved the desired result [citation].” (Belth v. Garamendi (1991) 232
Cal.App.3d 896, 901-02.) 
 
The
District contends that the instant action was not the catalyst for production
in response to the second CPRA request. The District contends that it was under
the belief that the documents that it was producing in response to the UCP
proceedings satisfied its obligations under the CPRA. (Turner Decl. ¶¶ 24-26.) The
District does not cite any authority for the assertion that production in
separate litigation satisfies its obligations under the CPRA. In any event, the
District requested clarification on the second CPRA request, provided an
estimated response time to the second request, and responded to the second
requests without referencing the UCP proceedings or referring to production in
the UCP proceedings. (Wenkart Decl. ¶¶ 5-7, 11-15 & Exs. H-J, M-Q.) Consequently,
the Court finds that the instant action motivated the District to produce
records responsive to the second request. The District’s previous production in
response to the instant action, as well as the Court’s issuance of an order to
produce records responsive to Request Nos. 2, 3, 7-11, and 14 in the second CPRA request and Request Nos. 1-8 in the
third CPRA request, entitles ADLA to an award of attorney fees and costs as the
prevailing party. 
 
            The District also argues that any
award must be reduced due to ADLA’s partial success. However, ADLA already
reduced the fees incurred for preparing the writ petition by 1/7 to account for
the fact that the other six non-CPRA causes of action in the petition were
dismissed on demurrer. (Troy Decl. ¶ 19.) The other billing entries provided by
ADLA pertain to the CPRA cause of action on which ADLA prevailed. (Troy Decl. ¶
19 & Ex. V [$37,550.79]; Wenkart Decl. ¶ 20 & Ex. U [$17,817.00]; Troy
Supp. Decl. ¶ 12 & Ex. FF [$32,437.50].) 
 
            However, ADLA’s fee request is
excessive to the extent that it seeks to recover fees for the first CPRA
request. ADLA first contended that the District did not respond to the first
CPRA request only to later rescind the request after the District opposed the
Petition with a showing that the District had, in fact, responded to that
request. While “there is no requirement that the trial court make an award of
attorney fees in an amount that is commensurate with or in proportion to the
degree of success in the CPRA litigation” (Bernardi v. County of Monterey
(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1398), the Court finds a reduction necessary here.

 
            The Court reduces ADLA’s fee request
by $2,009.00 for the fees that attorney Ronald Wenkart billed from
August 23, 2019 to January 24, 2020 in connection with the first CPRA request.
Attorney Kevin Troy also billed $14,662.50 from April 8 to April 12, 2024 in
connection with preparing the opening brief. (Troy Supp. Decl. ¶ 12 & Ex.
FF.) To account for the time spent on ADLA’s attention to and erroneous request
for a response to the first CPRA request, the Court believes ADLA’s fee request
for the opening brief should be reduced by 25%, or $3,655.63. 
 
            The fees are otherwise reasonable,
including fees incurred in drafting the second and third CPRA requests. Had the
District fully responded to the requests before ADLA filed the instant action,
the District would not be liable for such fees. 
 
            The District shall therefore be
liable for the fee award requested by ADLA, subject to the reductions noted
herein. 
 
VII.    Conclusion
 
The petition is GRANTED IN PART with respect to the
CPRA claim. By August 16, 2024, respondent Los Angeles Unified School District
shall produce records that are responsive to Request Nos. 2, 3, 7-11, and 14 contained in ADLA’s July 22, 2020 CPRA request and Request Nos. 1-8 contained in ADLA’s November 15,
2021 CPRA request. 
 
            Using the appropriate lodestar
approach, and based on the foregoing findings and in view of the totality of
the circumstances, the total and reasonable amount of attorney fees and costs
incurred for the work performed in connection with the Petition for Writ of
Mandate is $82,140.66 ($37,550.79 Troy + $17,817.00 Wenkart +
$32,437.50 Troy opening and reply briefs - $2,009.00 first CPRA request - $3,655.63
opening brief). Such fees are awarded to petitioners The Roman Catholic
Archbishop of Los Angeles and Archdiocese of Los Angeles Education &
Welfare Corporation and against respondent Los Angeles Unified
School District.
 
Pursuant to Local Rule 3.231(n), petitioners shall
prepare, serve, and ultimately file a proposed judgment and proposed writ of
mandate.
