And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting R&T Management, Inc.'s motion for attorney fees in the amount of $97,963.20. The dispute arose from Jimmi Lewis's petition for writ of mandate, which sought to compel VOI Insurance Solutions, LLC to allow inspection of its records as a member of VOI. R&T Management, Inc. prevailed in arguing that it was no longer a manager or member of VOI and that the Operating Agreement was unenforceable as to R&T. The judge found that R&T Management, Inc. is entitled to recover attorney fees under Civil Code § 1717(a) as the prevailing party in a discrete legal proceeding. The judge also found that R&T Management, Inc.'s fee request was reasonable, despite petitioner's contention that the number of hours claimed was excessive. The judge awarded attorney fees to R&T Management, Inc. and against Jimmi Lewis.
