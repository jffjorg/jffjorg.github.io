Summary:

The tentative ruling denies the petition for a writ of mandate filed by Richard Ellis, a former Police Officer with Burbank Glendale Pasadena Airport Authority. Ellis was terminated from his employment due to excessive absenteeism, falsification of timecards, and unfitness for duty. The court finds that the termination was proper and that the penalty of termination was not excessive. The court also finds that Ellis failed to demonstrate that respondent failed to proceed in the manner required by law and that Ellis did not raise claims of discrimination or retaliation based on medical condition during the administrative proceedings.
