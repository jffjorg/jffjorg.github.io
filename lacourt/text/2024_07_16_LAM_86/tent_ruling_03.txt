Case:                           Jimmi Lewis v. VOI
Insurance Solutions, LLC et al. (22STCP04241)
  
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Respondent R&T Management, Inc.’s Motion for Attorney
Fees is GRANTED. 
 
Pursuant to Civil Code § 1717, Respondent R&T
Management, Inc. (“R&T”) moves for an award of attorney fees in the amount
of $97,963.20. 
 
Petitioner Jimmi Lewis contended in his Petition for Writ of
Mandate that he was entitled to inspect the records of VOI Insurance Solutions,
LLC (“VOI”) as a member of VOI under the Operating Agreement. (Pet. ¶ 8, citing
Ex. 1 to Pet. [“Operating Agreement”], § 5.3; Pet. ¶ 14.) Petitioner sued
R&T as the purported current manager and member of VOI. (Pet. ¶ 3.) Petitioner
sought attorney fees that he incurred in enforcing his purported inspection
rights under the Operating Agreement. (Pet. ¶ 17, citing Operating Agreement §
18.21.) On March 19, 2024, the Court denied the Petition for Writ of Mandate. (Mircheff
Decl. ¶ 7 & Ex. E.) 
 
Civil Code § 1717(a) states: “In any action on a contract,
where the contract specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which
are incurred to enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the
parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the
party prevailing on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in
the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in
addition to other costs.” (Civ. Code § 1717(a).) The statute allows for
mutuality of remedy “when a person sued on a contract containing a provision
for attorney fees to the prevailing party defends the litigation by
successfully arguing the inapplicability, invalidity, unenforceability, or
nonexistence of the same contract.” (Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17
Cal.4th 599, 611.) 
 
Petitioner alleged that R&T, as manager of VOI, was
obligated under the Operating Agreement to allow inspection of VOI’s records. (Pet.
¶¶ 8, 12.) The Operating Agreement contains an attorney fee provision. (Pet. ¶
17, citing Operating Agreement § 18.21.) R&T prevailed in arguing that it
was no longer a manager or member of VOI and that, accordingly, the Operating
Agreement was unenforceable as to R&T. (Mircheff Decl. ¶ 7 & Ex. E at
32.) As a result, R&T is entitled to recover attorney fees from petitioner under
Civil Code § 1717(a). Indeed, the Court notes that petitioner did not challenge
the applicability of Civil Code § 1717(a) in the opposition or the contention
that R&T is a prevailing party.
 
Instead, petitioner contends that the motion for fees is
premature because the merits of VOI’s Cross Petition and petitioner’s
Cross-Cross Petition remain to be resolved in Department 24. (See 6/6/24
Minute Order [independent calendar court issued Order to Show Cause why
cross-petitions should not be dismissed].) “[C]ourts have awarded attorney fees
to a party obtaining an appealable order or judgment in a discrete legal
proceeding even though the underlying litigation on the merits was not final.”
(Otay River Constructors v. San Diego Expressway (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th
796, 807; see also Turner v. Schultz (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 974,
983-84 [finding that party could recover fees under Civil Code § 1717 in
“discrete legal proceeding” concerning whether arbitration should be allowed to
proceed, even though arbitration of merits had not yet occurred].) “A judgment
in a special proceeding is the final determination of the rights of the parties
therein.” (CCP § 1064.) Writs of mandate are part of Part 3 of the Code of
Civil Procedure governing special proceedings of a civil nature. (CCP § 1085.) Judgment
has been entered with respect to the Petition for Writ of Mandate. (Mircheff
Decl. ¶ 8 & Ex. F.) Judgment having been entered in a discrete legal
proceeding, R&T may move for attorney fees, even though the cross petitions
remain to be resolved.
 
Petitioner’s citations to Moore v. Liu (1999) 69
Cal.App.4th 745, Urbaniak v. Newton (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1837, and Presley
of Southern California v. Whelan (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 959 are unavailing
because these cases involved reversals of summary judgment on appeal where the merits
of the underlying litigation had not been resolved. (Moore, 69
Cal.App.4th at 754-55; Urbaniak, 19 Cal.App.4th at 1844; Presley,
at 146 Cal.App.3d 959 [196 Cal.Rptr. 1, 2].) Here, the merits of the writ
petition, a discrete legal proceeding, have been reduced to judgment. 
 
With respect to the amount of fees sought, R&T seeks
fees for 179 hours of work defending against the Petition for Writ of Mandate,
corresponding to $89,427.60 in fees, plus 18.6 hours working on the instant
motion for attorney fees, corresponding to $8,535.60 in fees. (Mircheff Decl. ¶¶
17-19 & Ex. G.) Petitioner argues that his writ petition was
straightforward and that the number of hours claimed by R&T is excessive on
its face. (Opp. at 4:9-10.) Petitioner asserts that overstaffing is evidenced
by three attorneys having worked on the case. (Opp. at 2:13-14.)
 
“In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many
hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point
to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to
the evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative,
or unrelated do not suffice.” (Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v.
California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)
Petitioner generally asserts that the number of hours claimed by R&T is
excessive without pointing to billing specific billing entries. Petitioner’s
opposition is insufficient to merit a reduction in fees.
 
Furthermore, 179 hours to defend against the writ petition
is not excessive on its face. Petitioner contends that R&T’s opposition was
based on conclusory arguments, including that R&T was not the managing
member of VOI, the petition was overbroad, and petitioner did not make a
pre-litigation demand. (Opp. at 3:27-4:8.) The Court disagrees with
petitioner’s simplistic characterization of what was required of R&T to
successfully address and defend against petitioner’s claims.  R&T seeks—and is entitled—to recover for
more than just drafting an opposition brief. Petitioner asserted that he had
inspection rights under California and Delaware law, which required R&T to
conduct research into petitioner’s contention. (Pet. ¶¶ 8, 9; Mircheff Decl. ¶
20.) Petitioner also filed a “cross-cross” petition, forcing R&T to analyze
petitioner’s claims and determine how to respond to the petition in the context
of the instant writ proceeding. Counsel also developed R&T’s defense by
regularly communicating with R&T. (Mircheff Decl. ¶ 20.) Notably, R&T does
not seek fees for its motion to strike the writ petition, which was denied on
May 18, 2023, or the motions to compel discovery responses, which were largely
granted on September 14, 2023. (Mircheff Decl. ¶ 17.) Further, R&T applied
a 10% discount to its fee request. (Mircheff Decl. ¶¶ 17, 19.) Based on the
foregoing, combined with the Court’s review of R&T’s billing records and
petitioner’s failure to address any specific billing entries, the Court finds
that R&T’s fee request, including counsel’s hourly rates, is reasonable. 
 
The motion is GRANTED. Using the appropriate lodestar
approach, and based on the foregoing findings and in view of the totality of
the circumstances, the total and reasonable amount of attorney fees incurred is
$97,963.20. Such fees are awarded to respondent R&T Management, Inc. and
against petitioner Jimmi Lewis.
