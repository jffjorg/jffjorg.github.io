[TENTATIVE] RULING ON VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT
  OF MANDATE
 
Dept. 86 (Hon. Curtis A. Kin)
 
 




 


 


 


 



Petitioner
Richard Ellis petitions for a writ of mandate directing respondent Burbank
Glendale Pasadena Airport Authority to set aside the termination of petitioner
and restore him to his prior position of Police Officer with back pay.  
 
I.       Factual Background
 
Starting
in 2006, petitioner Richard Ellis was employed by respondent Burbank Glendale
Pasadena Airport Authority as a Police Officer at Hollywood Burbank Airport in
Burbank. (AR 619, 1071.) Petitioner’s duties included having custody and
control of a loaded firearm and driving around the airport. (AR 228 [HT 61:2-7],
39-40 [HT 39:15-40:19], 250, 898, 909, 925, 929.) Petitioner was terminated
from his employment on July 21, 2021. (AR 925.)
 
During
petitioner’s employment, petitioner was absent on 1,749 days and on modified
duty for 772 days—totaling 2,521 workdays. (AR 228-29 [HT 61:15-62:24], 405,
407, 895-96, 909). During the approximately last two years of his employment, from
March 8, 2019 to February 8, 2021, petitioner did not work a full-service
workday as a police officer. (AR 407, 895, 909, 911.) Petitioner was on light
duty from March 8, 2019 to December 5, 2019 and on medical leave from December
5, 2019 to December 7, 2020. (AR 895, 909.) 
 
Plaintiff
was on ultra-light duty from December 7, 2020 to February 8, 2021. (AR 895, 909.)
During the last two months of his employment on modified duty, petitioner was absent
10 of 35 workdays, arrived to work late or left early 7 times, and fainted on
duty on January 19, 2021, when he lay under a desk for approximately 2 hours
before being discovered there. (AR 585, 588, 895, 909, 911.) 
 
In
addition, during petitioner’s employment, petitioner completed and signed three
timecards indicating he had worked for at least three and a half hours more
than his swipe card records indicate for his arrival to and departure from work
for the days in question. (AR 715-17, 721-22, 732-52; cf. AR 1083-84
[ALJ noted that respondent sought discipline for three inaccurate timecards].) Petitioner
admitted he submitted the timecards and that they were incorrect. (AR 721-22,
815:22-816:9.)
 
Respondent
terminated petitioner’s employment on July 21, 2021 after Chief Edward B.
Skvarna adopted and agreed with findings that “the Department cannot reasonably
accommodate your extraordinarily excessive absenteeism for the past 14 years
and its adverse impacts on the Department; that the Department cannot
responsibly return you to active duty as a sworn officer to drive a vehicle and
maintain a loaded weapon after fainting on duty and being down for 2.5 hours;
and, because you submitted multiple false timecards.” (AR 925.)
 
Petitioner’s
employment was governed by a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) between a
collective bargaining unit and respondent. (AR 266-375.) As relevant to this
case, Section 10.7 of the MOU states:
 
If
Management has reasonable and just cause to believe that an employee is not fit
for duty either mentally or physically, Management may place the employee on
administrative leave with pay until the employee is examined by a physician or
psychologist designated by Management. The exam shall be paid for by the
Authority.
 
(AR
318.) Respondent did not proceed with an independent medical examination under Section
10.7 of the MOU. (AR 1082.) Instead, before allowing petitioner to return to
work in any capacity, respondent required petitioner to provide a current
doctor’s note which (1) “specifically addresses or dismisses any potential
impacts of medication which could cause drowsiness, sleeping, impaired judgment
or lucidity, and/or which could impair your ability to possess, control and protect
a loaded firearm or drive a vehicle on duty” and (2) identifies when petitioner
could be expected to return to normal duty. (AR 63-64 [HT 63:23-64:7], 94-95
[HT 94:23-95:15], 150 [HT 150:5-20], 155 [HT 155:7-17], 382, 387-88, 390.) Petitioner
provided reports from his doctors, but his doctors did not diagnose or treat
the cause of petitioner’s fainting on duty. (AR 63-64 [HT 63:23-64:7], 70 [HT 70:13-22],
94-95 [HT 94:23-95:15], 222-24 [222:18-21, 223:24-224:1], 387-88, 390, 700.) Notably,
while one of petitioner’s doctors cleared him for duty shortly after the
fainting spell, the doctor did not address petitioner’s fainting in any manner.
(AR 396, 398.)
 
Petitioner
appealed the termination on July 27, 2021. (AR 937-39.) On February 22 and 23,
2022, the matter went to a full evidentiary hearing before Administrative Law
Judge Joseph Montoya (“ALJ”) at the Office of Administrative Hearings. (AR
1068.) The ALJ issued a Proposed Decision on August 30, 2022 denying the appeal.
(AR 1091.) The Proposed Decision upheld all three bases for termination based
on the findings (1) that, by submitting inaccurate time cards, petitioner did
not “meet the high standard for honesty imposed on all police officers”; (2) that
respondent needed “a reliable officer” and was unable to accommodate petitioner’s
absenteeism, need for modification of his duties, or fainting; and (3) that petitioner
“was not physically up to the job.” (AR 1089-90.) The ALJ’s decision was adopted
as the final decision of respondent on October 31, 2022. (AR 1066-67.) 
 
II.      Procedural History
 
            On
January 27, 2023, petitioner filed a Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate. On
April 3, 2023, respondent filed an Answer.
 
            On
November 27, 2023, petitioner filed an opening brief. On June 13, 2024, respondent
filed an opposition. On July 1, 2024, petitioner filed a reply. The Court has
received an electronic and hard copy of the administrative record and a hard
copy of the joint appendix. 
 
III.     Standard of Review
 
          Under CCP § 1094.5(b), the pertinent issues are whether the respondent
has proceeded without jurisdiction, whether there was a fair trial, and whether
there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion is
established if the agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the
decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by
the evidence. (CCP § 1094.5(b).)
 
Because the suspension of
petitioner from his position as Police Officer concerns a fundamental vested
right, the court exercises its independent judgment on the administrative
findings. (See Wences v. City
of Los Angeles (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 305, 314; Bixby v. Pierno (1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 143.) Under the independent
judgment test, “the trial court not only examines the administrative record for
errors of law, but also exercises its independent judgment upon the evidence
disclosed in a limited trial de novo.”
(Bixby, 4 Cal.3d at 143.) The court
must draw its own reasonable inferences from the evidence and make its own
credibility determinations. (Morrison v.
Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles Board of Commissioners (2003)
107 Cal. App. 4th 860, 868.)  
 
An agency is presumed to
have regularly performed its official duties. (Evid. Code § 664.) “In
exercising its independent judgment, a trial court must afford a strong
presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings, and the
party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing
the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the
evidence.”  (Fukuda v. City of Angels (1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 817, internal
quotations omitted.) A reviewing court “will not act as counsel for either
party to an appeal and will not assume the task of initiating and prosecuting a
search of the record for any purpose of discovering errors not pointed out in
the briefs.” (Fox v. Erickson (1950)
99 Cal.App.2d 740, 742.) When an appellant challenges “‘the sufficiency of the
evidence, all material evidence on the point must be set forth and not merely
their own evidence.” (Toigo v. Town of Ross (1998) 70 Cal.App.4th 309,
317.)  
 
“On questions of law
arising in mandate proceedings, [the Court] exercise[s] independent judgment.’”
(Christensen v. Lightbourne (2017) 15
Cal.App.5th 1239, 1251.) The interpretation of statute or regulation is a
question of law. (See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Quackenbush
(1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 65, 71.)
 
“The
propriety of a penalty imposed by an administrative agency is a matter vested
in the discretion of the agency, and its decision may not be disturbed unless
there has been a manifest abuse of discretion.” (Lake v. Civil Service
Commission (1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 224, 228.) If reasonable minds can differ
with regard to the propriety of the disciplinary action, there is no abuse of
discretion. (County of Los Angeles v. Civil Service Commission (1995) 39
Cal.App.4th 620, 634.) In considering whether an abuse of discretion occurred,
the “overriding consideration … is the extent to which the employee’s conduct
resulted in, or if repeated is likely to result in, ‘[h]arm to the public service.’
[Citations.] Other relevant factors include the circumstances surrounding the
misconduct and the likelihood of its recurrence.” (Skelly v. State Personnel
Bd. (1975) 15 Cal.3d 194, 218.)
 
IV.     Analysis
 
A.          
Petitioner
Fails to Demonstrate that Respondent Failed to Proceed in the Manner Required
by Law
 
In
the Opening Brief, petitioner challenges his termination on the ground that respondent
did not proceed in the manner required by law. Petitioner contends that he was
charged with misconduct only because respondent did not want to pay for a
medical examination to find him unfit for duty, as purportedly required under
Section 10.7 of the MOU.
 
            However, Section 10.7 of the MOU
does not require respondent to order an examination. Section 10.7 states in
relevant part:
 
If
Management has reasonable and just cause to believe that an employee is not fit
for duty either mentally or physically, Management may place the employee
on administrative leave with pay until the employee is examined by a physician
or psychologist designated by Management. The exam shall be paid for by the
Authority.
 
(AR
318, emphasis added.) “Generally speaking, ‘the word “may” is permissive—you
can do it if you want, but you aren't being forced to….” (Woolls v. Superior
Court (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 197, 208.) By using the word “may,” the MOU provides
respondent with the option, but not the obligation, to place an employee on
administrative leave when the employee’s fitness for duty is in question until
such time as an examination is completed. 
 
Under Section 10.7, if respondent orders an
examination, then respondent must pay for it. Here, however, respondent did not
order any examination. (AR 1082.) Instead, respondent opted to ask petitioner
for medical documentation from his own doctors addressing the reason why
petitioner fainted on January 19, 2021. (AR 63-64 [HT 63:23-64:7], 70 [HT 70:13-22],
94-95 [HT 94:23-95:15], 222-24 [222:18-21, 223:24-224:1], 387-88, 390, 700.) Other
than arguing the permissive provision of Section 10.7 required respondent to
proceed in the manner provided by that section, petitioner presents no
authority for the proposition that respondent could not proceed in the manner
that it did, namely, asking petitioner to provide doctors’ notes probative of
any reasonable accommodations that would allow petitioner to perform essential
duties of his job, including carrying a firearm and driving a vehicle. (AR 228
[HT 61:2-7], 39-40 [HT 39:15-40:19], 250, 898, 909, 925, 929; cf. Scotch
v. Art Institute of California (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 986, 1013, citing Taylor
v. Principal Financial Group, Inc. (5th Cir.1996) 93 F.3d 155, 165
[employee has initial burden under Fair Employment and Housing Act to identify
disability, resulting limitations, and suggest reasonable accommodations of
limitations ].) 
 
            Petitioner argues that he provided doctors’
notes that indicated that he was fit for duty with no restrictions. (AR 139-40
[HT 139:21-140:9], 396, 398.) However, the notes do not explain why petitioner
fainted on January 19, 2021. (AR 396, 398.) The duties of a Police Officer
include “[s]afely and skillfully us[ing] firearms” and “[s]afely operat[ing] a
motor vehicle.” (AR 250.) Respondent’s “General Order 140,” which regulates the
conduct of police officers, requires police officers to be “physically and
mentally fit to perform their assigned duties and “properly equipped and cognizant
of information for proper performance of their assigned duties” and to “remain
awake, alert, and attentive while on duty.” (AR 253-54, 317.) Fainting limits
petitioner’s ability to perform his assigned duties of carrying and using a
firearm and driving a motor vehicle. Given petitioner’s inability to provide a
cause for his fainting (AR 222-224 [HT 222:18-21, 223:24-224:1], 396, 398),
respondent was entitled to conclude as it did that petitioner was not fit for
duty and could not be reasonably accommodated. 
 
            Petitioner argues that respondent’s
charges of misconduct, including excessive absenteeism and falsification of
timecards, was a pretext to terminate petitioner for taking time off for
medical reasons. But petitioner did not argue in the administrative proceedings
that he was discriminated against based on medical condition or retaliated
against for taking medical leave. In petitioner’s appeal, he argued that he did
not commit any misconduct, that the discipline for any misconduct was
excessive, that respondent failed to provide petitioner with proper training,
and that respondent failed to comply with its procedural and legal
requirements. (AR 937-39.) In petitioner’s post-hearing brief, petitioner
argued that respondent violated the MOU by placing the burden on petitioner to
determine the cause of his fainting and that his submission of inaccurate
timecards was inadvertent. (AR 1039-64.) While petitioner noted that discrimination
against employees who seek workers’ compensation is prohibited (AR 1061),
petitioner never argued in his appeal or post-hearing brief that he was subject
to medical condition discrimination or retaliation for taking medical leave. (See
AR 1085 [ALJ addressed claims of discrimination for seeking workers’
compensation benefits].) 
 
The
exhaustion doctrine “requires that a party must not only initially raise the
issue in the administrative forum, but he must proceed through the entire
proceeding to a final decision on the merits of the entire controversy.” (McHugh
v. County of Santa Cruz (1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 533, 539.) “[E]xhaustion of
the administrative remedy is a jurisdictional prerequisite to resort to the
courts.” (Abelleira v. District Court of Appeal, Third Dist. (1941) 17
Cal.2d 280, 293.) “The exhaustion doctrine is principally grounded on concerns
favoring administrative autonomy (i.e., courts should not interfere with an
agency determination until the agency has reached a final decision) and
judicial efficiency (i.e., overworked courts should decline to intervene in an
administrative dispute unless absolutely necessary).” (Farmers Ins. Exchange
v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 391.) Petitioner bears the burden
to establish that it exhausted administrative remedies. (Westinghouse Elec.
Corp. v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 32, 37.) 
 
            Petitioner did not raise discrimination
based on medical condition or retaliation based on taking medical leave during
the administrative proceedings in any meaningful way.  He, therefore, cannot newly assert these
claims in the instant writ proceeding. Tellingly, petitioner does not even
attempt to address respondent’s argument regarding exhaustion in the reply.
 
            Because petitioner failed to
demonstrate that respondent was required to order and pay for an examination
before terminating petitioner, petitioner fails to demonstrate that a writ of
mandate should issue. 
 
B.          
The
Penalty of Termination Was Not Arbitrary, Capricious, or an Abuse of Discretion
 
Petitioner
argues that discharge for timecard errors is excessive given his employment was
improperly terminated for perceived unfitness of duty.[1]

 
“Judicial
interference with the agency’s assessment of a penalty ‘will only be sanctioned
when there is an arbitrary, capricious or patently abusive exercise of
discretion by the administrative agency.’” (Kazensky v. City of Merced
(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 44, 54.) 
 
            For the reasons discussed above, the
termination of petitioner’s employment as a Police Officer was not improper
because his inability to provide an explanation for his fainting called into
question his ability to carry a firearm and drive a motor vehicle. Police
officers must be “found to be free from any physical…condition…that might
adversely affect the exercise of the powers of a peace officer” upon hiring and
thereafter (Gov. Code § 1031(f); Sager v. County of Yuba (2007) 156
Cal.App.4th 1049, 1059 [section 1031 standards must be “maintained throughout a
peace officer's career”].) The record indicates petitioner was not free from a
physical condition that could adversely impact his ability to perform his
duties. Furthermore, petitioner does not dispute that he has taken the
equivalent of 6.9 years of medical leave (AR 895-96, 1075) and that he
submitted three inaccurate timecards—both of which might independently (and certainly
do collectively) support the termination decision.
 
Under
the circumstances presented here, termination of his employment was not
arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.
 
V.      Conclusion
 
The petition is DENIED. Pursuant to Local Rule
3.231(n), respondent shall prepare, serve, and ultimately file a proposed
judgment.
