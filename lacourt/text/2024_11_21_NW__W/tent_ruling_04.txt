BACKGROUND
 
On March 21, 2013, Plaintiff Glenn
Stern (“Stern”) and Defendant Gideon Fridman (“Fridman”) entered into a
Retainer Agreement in which Fridman retained Stern to represent Fridman in
connection with litigation matters, including an action against Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A. (“Wells Fargo Case.”) Stern alleges that Fridman owes Stern the sum
total of $168,227.50 for legal services rendered for work during trial and through
the conclusion of the Wells Fargo Case. On May 23, 2017, Stern filed a
Complaint against Fridman alleging: 1. Breach of Contract; 2. Common
Count—Account Stated; 3. Common Count—Goods and Services Rendered; and 4.
Common Count—Open Book Account
 
On November 29, 2018, Fridman filed a
cross complaint. Fridman alleges that sixteen weeks prior to the start of
trial, Stern told Fridman the fees would be $55,000 through trial. The parties
negotiated the amount to $50,000 and Mr. Fridman paid the amount. Fridman
stated he never was provided with any outstanding invoices, demands for
payments, etc., putting him on notice of any outstanding balance. He alleges he
did not know about outstanding fees until he was served with this lawsuit. He
never saw invoices for the claimed amounts until such invoices were produced in
discovery. Fridman terminated Stern shortly after the conclusion of the Wells
Fargo Case, yet Stern, knowing Fridman is elderly and has suffered a stroke, is
attempting to charge him fees for 2 years after the litigation was concluded. 
 
The cross-complaint asserts causes of
action for: 1. Breach of Fiduciary Duty 2. Breach of the Implied Covenant of
Good Faith and Fair Dealing 3. Elder Abuse 4. Intentional Infliction of
Emotional Distress 5. Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress 6. Violation
of B&P Code 17200 and 7. Fraud
 
On May 17, 2019, the court granted
Plaintiff’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as to the fourth and fifth
causes of action without leave to amend. Defendant withdrew its third cause of
action. 
 
The action proceeded to trial and on
June 3, 2024, judgment was entered in Plaintiff’s favor in the amount of
$242,180.66. 
 
[Tentative] Ruling: GRANT
 
Counsel contends an irremediable and irreconcilable breakdown of
the attorney-client relationship between Mr. Fridman and Counsel has occurred such
that continued representation is impossible. 
 
Counsel has complied with the requirements of CRC Rule 3.1362 by
filing forms MC-051 and MC-052 and lodging with the Court a copy of the
proposed order on form MC-053. Counsel confirmed Plaintiff’s last known address
by e-mail. 
 
Mr. Fridman filed an appeal in the instant action, which was
recently dismissed. 
 
Accordingly, the Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED.
