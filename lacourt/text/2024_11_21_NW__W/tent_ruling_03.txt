BACKGROUND
 
On
May 3, 2024, Plaintiff Global Innovations, LLC filed a complaint against Norman
J. Kravetz for breach of contract. Plaintiff alleges on November 9, 2022,
Defendant executed a Promissory Note in favor of Plaintiff, in the amount of
$1,200.000.00. Plaintiff alleges after Defendant defaulted on the Original Note
by failing to make timely payments, Plaintiff and Kravetz executed a First
Amendment to Promissory Note on October 20, 2023, which amended certain terms
of the Original Note. Plaintiff further alleges in the Amendment to Note,
Plaintiff and Defendant stipulated to a balance as of the effective date of the
Amended Note of $776,985.55 plus an “Extension Fee” of $19,424.64, payable by
October 31, 2023, and a past-due payment of $33,858.98 by October 20, 2023.
However, Plaintiff alleges on April 15, 2024, Defendants defaulted on the
Agreement by failing to make required payments. 
 
[TENTATIVE]
RULING:
 
Plaintiff Global Innovations, LLC’s Ex Parte
Application for Right to Attach Order and Pre-Judgment Writ of Attachment
Against Defendant Norma J. Kravetz is GRANTED. 
 
REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
 
Plaintiff
requests this court take judicial notice of several court documents including a
complaint, writ of attachment, motion to continue trial by less than 90 days in
Pacific Western Bank v. Norman J. Kravetz et al, LASC Case No.
23STCV09801; complaint filed in LTL Insurance Services Inc. Profit Sharing
Plan, et al. v. JH Portfolio Debt Equities, LLC, et al., LASC Case No.
24SMCV02361; complaint and writ of attachment filed in Aaron Kitzman et al.
v. Kravetz Capital Funding, LLC et al., LASC Case No. 23VECV04655; complaint
filed in RBE Capital Partners Fund LP v. JH Portfolio Debt Equities, LLC,
LASC No. 24VECV00463; and complaint filed in Connie Brockamn et al. v.
Kravetz Capital Funding, LLC et. al., LASC No. 23VECV05660. 
 
Plaintiff
seeks judicial notice of these documents to demonstrate Kravetz is personally
named as a defendant in at least five other lawsuits with different lenders
regarding breach of promissory notes of which enforcement efforts are underway totaling
at least $22,880,000.00. The court GRANTS Plaintiff’s request for judicial
notice as to the existence of these documents. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Plaintiff
appears ex parte to request that the court issue a right to attach order
and prejudgment writ of attachment on Defendant Kravetz in the total amount of $872,708.90.
 The court finds that ex parte notice was
properly given to defendant Kravetz.  Plaintiff
makes the application pursuant to the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure 526
and 527 on the grounds that Plaintiff has a probable validity of prevailing
against Kravetz and there is a grave and immediate danger that Plaintiff will
suffer irreparable harm due to Kravetz’s self-admitted imminent likelihood of
filing for bankruptcy.  It appears that
they are actually moving under CCP 481.010 et seq.
 
“Upon
the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter, the plaintiff may apply
pursuant to this article for a right to attach order and a writ of attachment
by filing an application for the order and writ with the court in which the
action is brought.”  (CCP § 484.010.) 
 
The
application shall be executed under oath and must include: (1) a statement
showing that the attachment is sought to secure the recovery on a claim upon
which an attachment may be issued; (2) a statement of the amount to be secured
by the attachment; (3) a statement that the attachment is not sought for a
purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is
based; (4) a statement that the applicant has no information or belief that the
claim is discharged or that the prosecution of the action is stayed in a
proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. section 101 et seq.); and (5) a
description of the property to be attached under the writ of attachment and a
statement that the plaintiff is informed and believes that such property is
subject to attachment.  (CCP §
484.020.)  
 
“The
application [for a writ of attachment] shall be supported by an affidavit
showing that the plaintiff on the facts presented would be entitled to a
judgment on the claim upon which the attachment is based.”  (CCP § 484.030.)  “The declarations in the moving papers must
contain evidentiary facts, stated ‘with particularity,’ and based on actual
personal knowledge with all documentary evidence properly identified and
authenticated.” (Hobbs v. Weiss (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 76, 79–80 [citing
CCP § 482.040].) “In contested applications, the court must consider the
relative merits of the positions of the respective parties and make a
determination of¿the probable outcome of the litigation.” (Hobbs, supra,
73 Cal.App.4th at p. 80.) 
 
The
court shall issue a right to attach order if the court finds all of the
following: (1) The claim upon which the attachment is based is one upon which
an attachment may be issued. (2) The plaintiff has established the probable
validity of the claim upon which the attachment is based.  (3) The attachment is not sought for a purpose
other than the recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based. (4) The
amount to be secured by the attachment is greater than zero. (CCP
§484.090.)   
 
Basis
of Attachment
 
As
noted above, “an attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim or claims
for money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or implied, where
the total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily ascertainable
amount not less than five hundred dollars ($500) exclusive of costs, interest,
and attorney's fees.”  (CCP § 483.010(a).)  “An attachment may not be
issued on a claim which is secured by any interest in real property arising
from agreement ….”  (CCP § 483.010(b).)   
 
In
this matter, Plaintiff’s claims are for monies owed upon a contract. Moreover,
the amount sought to be attached by Plaintiff is of a fixed or readily
ascertainable amount greater than $500. Plaintiff seeks $872,708.90. Lastly,
Plaintiff testifies Plaintiff’s claim is not secured by any interest in real
property. (See Wazana Decl. ¶13, Exhs. 3, 7.) 
 
Lastly,
as noted by Plaintiff, “[i]f the action is against a defendant who is a natural
person, an attachment may be issued only on a claim which arises out of the
conduct by the defendant of a trade, business, or profession. An Attachment may
not be issued on a claim against a defendant who is a natural person if the
claim is based on the sale or lease of property…used by the defendant primarily
for personal, family, or household purpose.” (CCP § 483.010(c).) There is no
indication that Defendant intended to use the property primarily for personal,
family, or household purposes and during Defendant’s deposition, he admitted he
owed Plaintiff money because they “lent money or transferred other obligations”
and he has admitted that he has over fifty years of experience in real estate
development. (See Enenstein Decl., Exh. 1.) 
 
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s claim meets the statutory requirements upon which attachment may be
issued.
 
Purpose
and Amount of Attachment
 
As
noted above, to obtain a writ of attachment, Plaintiff must prove that the
attachment is not sought for any purpose other than to secure recovery on the
claim. (CCP § 484.090.) Here, Counsel testifies the ex parte application
is brought solely to secure recovery of monies owed to Plaintiff under the Note
and Amendment to the Note that are the subject of Plaintiff’s contractual claim
against Defendant Norman J. Kravetz. (Enenstein Decl. ¶2.) The court also notes
the total amount sought to be secured is $872,708.90, which is evidently
greater than zero. 
 
Probable
Validity of Claims 
 
“A
claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is more likely than not that the
plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant on that claim.”  (CCP § 481.190.)  In determining this issue, the court must
consider the relative merits of the positions of the respective parties.  (Kemp Bros. Construction, Inc. v. Titan
Electric Corp. (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1474, 1484.)  The court does not determine whether the
claim is actually valid; that determination will be made at trial and is not
affected by the decision on the application for the order.  (CCP § 484.050(b).)
 
Plaintiff
contends they can sufficiently establish probable validity of their claim. The
application is based on a claim for breach of contract. A claim for breach of
contract requires a showing of the following elements: (1) the existence of a
contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3)
defendant’s breach, and (4) damages to plaintiff therefrom.  (Acoustics, Inc. v. Trepte Construction
Co. (1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 887, 913.) 
 
Plaintiff
argues the evidence clearly demonstrates that Plaintiff is more likely than not
to obtain a judgement against Kravetz for its breach of contract claim because
Kravetz agreed to and entered the terms of the Note and Amendment to Note and
has defaulted on the note by failing to make timely payments. (Wazana Decl., ¶¶
5-22.) Kravetz admitted in his deposition that he agreed to the Note in favor
of Plaintiff for $1,200,000.00 and the Note and Amendment to Note show Kravetz
signed them. (Enenstein Decl., ¶¶ 3-4, Exh. 1 at 21:20-23.) Kravetz admitted
that he received the $1,200,000.00 from Plaintiff under the Note. (Enenstein
Decl., Exh. 1 at 28:23-29:10). Kravetz then made some payments on the Note, but
then failed to make timely payments thereto. (Enenstein Decl., ¶¶ 6-7, Exh. 1
at 30:1-4, 17-20; Wazana Decl., ¶ 14.) After defaulting on the Note, Kravetz
then agreed to the Amended Note, whereby Kravetz agreed to pay a total balance
of $776,985.55 with 10% interest. (See Enenstein Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. 1 at 28:23-29:10;
Wazana Decl., ¶¶ 16-17, Exh. 7.) It also cannot be disputed that Kravetz
defaulted on the Note and Promissory Note. (See Enenstein Decl., Exh. 7,
25:17-24.)
 
Under
these circumstances, Plaintiff’s evidence shows the following: (1) a contract
exists between the parties by way of the Note and Amendment to Note agreements;
(2) plaintiff performed under the promissory notes by funding the required
payment; (3) Defendant breached his obligations under the Note and Amendment to
Note agreements by failing to make the necessary payments; and (4) Plaintiff
was damaged as a result.  
 
No
opposition has been filed. Accordingly, the court finds that Plaintiff has
shown that it is more than likely than not that it will obtain a judgment
against the Defendant on its promissory note claim. 
 
Exemption

 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 485.220(a)(4) requires that “the property sought to
be attached, or the portion thereof to be specified in the writ, is not exempt
from attachment.” Here, Plaintiff seeks to attach Kravetz’ interests in the
Business Center Property, the Vanalden Property, any securities, any stocks,
and any bonds as well as attach any interest in money on premises where a trade
or business is conducted, plus money in excess of $1,000 located elsewhere or
in a deposit account. (See AT-125.) Counsel for Plaintiff attests he is informed
and believes that no assets sought to be attached are exempt. (Enenstein Decl.,
¶ 16.) 
 
Defendant
did not file an opposition. 
 
Undertaking
 
Code
of Civil Procedure section 489.210 requires the plaintiff to file an
undertaking before issuance of a writ of attachment.  Code of Civil Procedure section 489.220
provides, with exceptions, for an undertaking in the amount of $10,000. 
 
Plaintiff
does not dispute the $10,000.00 amount (See AT-125, Sec. 2(h).) 
 
Accordingly,
the ex parte application is GRANTED in the amount of $872,708.90.  Plaintiff is ordered to post an undertaking
in the amount of $10,000.00.
