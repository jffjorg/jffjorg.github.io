And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to be relieved as counsel, filed by Jeffrey Alpert, Esq., on behalf of defendant Gideon Fridman. Fridman and his counsel contend that there has been an irreconcilable breakdown in their attorney-client relationship, making it impossible for Alpert to continue representing Fridman. The breakdown allegedly occurred due to discrepancies over outstanding fees, which Alpert claims amount to $168,227.50. Fridman, on the other hand, disputes these fees and claims he was not provided with outstanding invoices or demands for payment. The judge has granted the motion, citing the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship as the reason for relief.
