Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Joseph L. Giles, filed a complaint against the defendants, Los Angeles Unified School District and Sergio Liborio Carrillo, alleging negligence in an automobile incident. However, the defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that the plaintiff's deemed admissions establish that they were not negligent. The plaintiff did not oppose the motion, and the judge has determined that the evidence is sufficient to meet the defendants' burden to show they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. As a result, the plaintiff cannot maintain a claim for negligence, and the defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted.
