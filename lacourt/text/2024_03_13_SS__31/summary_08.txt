Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has tentatively ruled on HACLA's demurrer to the First Amended Complaint filed by Plaintiff Santos Hernandez. The Court concludes that the First Amended Complaint sufficiently pleads the retained control exception to the Privette doctrine, and therefore, HACLA is not barred by Privette. The Court also finds that the First Amended Complaint sufficiently pleads that HACLA owed a duty to Plaintiff to maintain a safe work environment. The Court has overruled HACLA's demurrer and ordered the parties to give notice.

The Court found that while HACLA argued that the First Amended Complaint was uncertain and did not plead sufficient facts to support liability, the Court concluded that the pleading was sufficient to provide notice to HACLA. The Court also rejected HACLA's contention that it did not owe a duty to Plaintiff to maintain a safe work environment, citing the statutes and case law that impose a duty on public entities to maintain a safe work environment.

The Court noted that the First Amended Complaint alleged that HACLA hired a general contractor, which then hired Steel Craft Fabrication, Inc. as a subcontractor, and that the elevator suddenly fell due to broken cables and other malfunctions, causing Plaintiff to fall six stories. The Court found that the pleading sufficiently apprised HACLA of the factual contentions against it and that the allegations were sufficient to plead around Privette.
