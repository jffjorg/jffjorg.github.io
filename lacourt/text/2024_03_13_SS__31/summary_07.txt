And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies without prejudice a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Nathan Samooha, Esq. on behalf of Jayden Reyes, a minor. The motion is denied because the correct party, Daniel Danny Geoulla, Esq., is the counsel of record for the plaintiff, and the motion papers were not properly served on the plaintiff. The court also notes that it is unclear whether the plaintiff's address has been confirmed within the past 30 days. The moving party is ordered to serve the motion papers on the clerk of the court if unable to serve the plaintiff. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement, and if a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court.
