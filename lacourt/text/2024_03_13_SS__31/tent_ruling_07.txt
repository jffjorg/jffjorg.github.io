(“Samooha”) of B&D Law Group, APLC moves to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Jayden Reyes, a minor, by and through his Guardian Ad Litem, Priscilla Serrano (“Plaintiff”) contending relief is necessary because of a breakdown in communication.  The motion is denied without prejudice for the following reasons:  First, Plaintiff’s attorney of record is Daniel Danny Geoulla, Esq. Unless a Notice of Change of Handling Attorney is filed, Daniel Danny Geoulla should be the individual moving to be relieved as counsel.     Second, Samooha declares that Plaintiff was served the motion papers. However, neither Item 3(b)(1) or 3(b)(2) were indicated on form MC-052; at least one of the items must be properly completed. Thus, it is unclear whether to the Court whether Plaintiff’s address has been confirmed within the past 30 days as current.   If Plaintiff’s counsel is unable to serve Plaintiff at a confirmed address, then in addition to serving Plaintiff, Counsel must also serve the moving papers on the Clerk of the Court pursuant to CCP §1011 and California Rules Court, rule 3.1362(d).   Moving party is ordered to give notice.  PLEASE TAKE NOTICE: Parties are encouraged to meet and confer after reading this tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement. If a party intends to submit on this tentative ruling,¿the party must send an email to the court at¿sscdept31@lacourt.org¿with the Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.¿ The body of the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.¿¿ Unless¿all¿parties submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.¿ You should assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.¿¿ If the parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.¿ After the Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of the subject motion without leave.¿  Dated this 12th day of March 2024      Hon.
