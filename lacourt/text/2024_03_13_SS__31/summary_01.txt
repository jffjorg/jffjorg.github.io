And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Dr. Wegge's motion to set aside default and default judgment. The judge finds that Dr. Wegge did not receive actual notice of the lawsuit due to improper service of process. The judge notes that Dr. Wegge promptly retained counsel and moved for relief after discovering the action. The judge concludes that these facts warrant setting aside the default entered against Dr. Wegge. The judge orders Dr. Wegge to file a separate copy of her proposed answer within five days and directs the parties to move expeditiously in litigating the action.
