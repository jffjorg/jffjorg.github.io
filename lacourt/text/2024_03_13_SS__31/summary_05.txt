And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling on the unopposed motions to compel discovery responses filed by Defendant Noberto Martinez Cruz. The motions were filed on May 18, 2022, and the responses were due by June 22, 2022. Despite meeting and conferring with the Plaintiff, Bahman Khodayari, who is representing himself, the Plaintiff has failed to serve responses to date. The Judge notes that the Plaintiff was properly served with the discovery requests and that the time to respond has expired. Therefore, the Judge grants the unopposed motions and orders the Plaintiff to serve verified responses to the discovery requests, without objections, within 20 days.

Additionally, the Judge awards sanctions to Defendant Cruz in the amount of $184.95, which includes three motion filing fees of $61.65 per motion. The Judge also orders the Plaintiff to pay sanctions to Defendant Cruz within 20 days. The Judge encourages the parties to meet and confer after reading the tentative ruling to see if they can reach an agreement, and if not, to appear remotely or in person for oral argument on March 13, 2024.
