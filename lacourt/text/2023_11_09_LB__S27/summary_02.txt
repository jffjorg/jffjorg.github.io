Summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to vacate default filed by Cross-Defendants Kenneth Lee-Thorp and Linda Deane Thorp, who are individuals doing business as Freight Arrangers. The Court finds that Prestig, Inc. did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that the Thorps are a partnership and therefore must be represented by an attorney. The Court grants the motion to vacate default and orders the Thorps to file a separate copy of their answer within five days. The Court also notes that Dennis Cammarano, the attorney for Tokio Marine America Insurance Company, may be representing the Thorps and advises him to comply with all ethical duties, including full disclosure of any representation. The Court also reminds the parties that a case management conference is scheduled for the same day as the hearing on the motion to vacate default.
