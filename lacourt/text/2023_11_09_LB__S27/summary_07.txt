And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is denying the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff's deposition due to two reasons. Firstly, the defendant failed to include a declaration stating that they had contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance, as required by CCP §2025.450(b)(2). The defendant's counsel claims to have sent a case management conference letter and notice of motion to compel, but the documents attached to the motion papers do not comply with the meet and confer requirement. Secondly, the motion does not show good cause for production of the documents sought at deposition, as required by CCP §2025.450(b)(1). Therefore, the motion is denied. As a result, the request for sanctions is also denied. The judge orders the defendant to give notice to the plaintiff and advises the parties to follow specific instructions regarding submissions and appearances at the hearing.
