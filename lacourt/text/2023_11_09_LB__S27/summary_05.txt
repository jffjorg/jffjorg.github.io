Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint to include claims related to mold and asbestos. The judge finds that the proposed amended complaint is actually a supplemental complaint, which is permitted under CCP §464(a) and Foster v. Sexton (2021). The judge notes that requiring the parties to litigate overlapping issues in an entirely new action would be unduly time-consuming and expensive.

However, the judge also finds that it is not reasonable to require Defendant to prepare to defend itself against new allegations concerning mold and asbestos within the next two months. Therefore, the judge continues the trial date for six months to July 22, 2024.

The judge conditions its ruling on Plaintiff granting Defendant permission to file a motion for summary adjudication of the newly-added claims concerning mold and/or asbestos. The judge also requires the parties to agree that the new allegations are the proper subject of a potential motion for summary adjudication pursuant to CCP §437c(f) and (t).

If the parties submit on the tentative, they must file a separate copy of the Second Amended (Supplemental) Complaint within ten days, and Defendant must file a responsive pleading within the statutory time thereafter. If Defendant does not file a timely responsive pleading, its answer to the FAC shall be deemed its answer to the SAC.
