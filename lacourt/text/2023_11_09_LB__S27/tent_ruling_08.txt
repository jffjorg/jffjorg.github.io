 Case Number:  23LBCV00383    Hearing Date:   November 9, 2023    Dept:  S27 1.    
Background Facts
Plaintiff, Lutrice Price filed this action against Defendant, Audi of
Beverly Hills, alleging a sole cause of action for breach of contract.  Plaintiff’s complaint is a judicial council
form complaint, and is devoid of substantive allegations demonstrating the
basis of her claims.    
 
2.    
Motion to Compel Arbitration
Defendant moves to compel arbitration pursuant to the parties’ written retail
installment sales contract agreement, which is attached as Exhibit A to the Declaration
of Sam Yadegari in support of the motion. 
The contract is between Audi of Beverly Hills and Plaintiff.  The contract contains a provision, at the
bottom of page one, requiring the parties to arbitrate any dispute arising under
the contract.
 
Notably, any opposition to the motion was due on or before 10/27/23,
and the Court has not received timely opposition to the motion.  
 
CCP §1281.2 obligates the Court to grant a motion to compel arbitration
if it finds a binding contract providing for arbitration exists, unless the
party opposing arbitration provides evidence establishing grounds for refusal to
enforce the agreement.  In light of the
lack of opposition, Plaintiff necessarily failed to meet his burden to establish
any such grounds, and the motion to compel arbitration is granted.
 
CCP §1281.4 requires the Court to stay the pending action pursuant to
completion of arbitration proceedings.  Defendant
seeks an order staying this action.  The request
is granted.  This action is stayed
pending completion of arbitration proceedings.
