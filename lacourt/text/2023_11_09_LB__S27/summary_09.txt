And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the parties' joint statements regarding special interrogatories (SROGs) and requests for production of documents (RPDs). The Court finds that Defendant must provide further responses to SROGs 4-8 and 15-18, which remain in dispute. With respect to RPD 22, the Court limits the scope of the request to email communications discussing possible countermeasures in response to the exhaust defect in 2020 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 vehicles. The Court also finds that Defendant must provide information regarding all similar defects in vehicles of the same make, model, and year. The Court overrules Defendant's objections to the SROGs and RPDs, and orders Defendant to serve further responses without objection. The Court does not impose sanctions on either party, as Plaintiff did not request sanctions. The parties are ordered to meet and confer regarding remaining disputes, and to submit joint statements regarding the remaining issues.
