And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses a dispute between Plaintiff and Defendant regarding the production of Defendant's employees as witnesses at trial. The Judge finds that the law is clear that out-of-state witnesses cannot be compelled to testify in California by subpoena, and that there is no authority permitting substitute service of a subpoena on a witness through their attorney. The Judge notes that Defendant has indicated a willingness to produce the witnesses during the defense phase of the trial, but is refusing to produce them for Plaintiff's case in chief.

The Judge is inclined to allow Plaintiff to conduct further depositions of the witnesses, but is not inclined to continue the trial to accommodate this request. The Judge is also considering an order that would permit Plaintiff to call the witnesses produced by Defendant, and is seeking input from the parties on the best way to resolve the issue. The Judge will discuss potential solutions with the parties at the hearing on November 9, 2023.
