Summary:
The Judge, Mitchell Beckloff, has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer to the petition filed by Supporters Alliance for Environmental Responsibility (Petitioner) challenging the City of San Gabriel's approval of the 330 West Las Tunas Drive Project under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The Petitioner's petition was filed 40 days after the Notice of Exemption was filed, which appears to be beyond the 35-day statute of limitations. The Judge finds that the Petitioner has not pleaded an excuse from the statute of limitations or included relevant information and exhibits from the Grear declaration. The Judge grants leave to amend the petition, allowing the Petitioner to cure the defect.
