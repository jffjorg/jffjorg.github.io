SUMMARY OF PETITION 
 
Petitioner challenges the City’s approval of the 330 West Las Tunas Drive Project (Planning Case
No. PPD21-008) (the Project), including a Precise Plan of Design for the
Project, under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Public
Resources Code section 21000. The Project “involves the demolition of an
existing one-story, 5,032-square foot medical office building and associated
surface parking lot and the construction of a new five-story, 74,490- square
foot medical office building with two levels of subterranean parking on a
63,779-square foot site, totaling approximately 1.46 acres, located at 330 West
Las Tunas Drive in the City of San Gabriel.” (Pet. ¶¶ 1-2.)
 
Petitioner contends Respondents “unlawfully
determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA pursuant to the Class 32
In-Fill Development Categorical Exemption (‘In-Fill Exemption’), 14 Cal. Code
Regs., § 15332.” (Pet. ¶ 1.)  
 
STANDARD OF REVIEW 
 
A demurrer
tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer must appear
on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters. (Code Civil
Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)
“We assume the truth of the allegations in the complaint, but do not assume the
truth of contentions, deductions, or conclusions of law.” (California
Logistics, Inc. v. State of California (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 242, 247.)  
 
“ ‘A demurrer on the ground of the bar of the statute of limitations
will not lie where the action may be, but is not necessarily barred.’ [Citations.] It
must appear clearly and affirmatively that, upon the face of the complaint, the
right of action is necessarily barred.” (Lockley v. Law Office of Cantrell,
Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 881.)  
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Respondents contend the petition is barred by
CEQA’s 35-day statute of limitations set forth in Public Resources Code section
21167, subdivision (d).[1]
(Memo 9.) “Section 21167(d) makes
clear that suits claiming a project was ‘improperly’ approved as exempt from
CEQA must be brought within the 35-day period after an [Notice of Exemption] is
filed and posted.” (Stockton Citizens for Sensible Planning v. City of
Stockton (2010) 48 Cal.4th 481, 505.) 

 
“On August 17, 2023, the City filed a Notice of
Exemption with the Los Angeles County Clerk, noticing exemption of the Project
from CEQA review pursuant to the In-Fill Exemption.” (Pet. ¶ 49.) Petitioner
filed this action on September 26, 2023—40 days after August 17, 2023. (See electronic
file stamp.) Accordingly, it appears clearly from the face of the petition—based
on the current allegations—the petition is barred by the 35-day statute of
limitations.
 
Petitioner admits “that the last day to file the Petition for Writ of Mandate and
Complaint to challenge the City of San Gabriel’s adoption of the In-Fill
Exemption on CEQA grounds was September 21, 2023.” (Opposition 9:14-16.) Petitioner
argues “consistent with the California Code of Civil Procedure and Rules of
Court, Petitioner did in fact submit for filing an otherwise
compliant Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint in the Northeast District
of the Los Angeles County Superior Court through the Express Network electronic
filing service [on September 21, 2023] . . . as explained . . . in the
declaration of Toyer Grear.” (Opposition 9:17-19 [emphasis added].)  
 
Petitioner’s
defense to the statute of limitations depends on the factual information
provided in the Grear declaration.[2] Specifically Petitioner
“requested that Express Network file the initiating documents at the Pasadena
courthouse in the Northeast District of the Los Angeles County Superior Court
on September 21, 2023” and “[o]n Monday,
September 25, 2023, [Grear] became aware for the first time that the Los
Angeles County Superior Court’s Northeast District had rejected Petitioner’s
entire filing of all the initiating documents at approximately 2:52 p.m. that
day” on the grounds either that a CEQA box was not checked or Petitioner was
required to file the petition in the Central District of Los Angeles County
Superior Court. (Grear Decl. ¶¶ 4-9 and Exh. 3.)  
 
“A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.” (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th
740, 747 [emphasis added].) Petitioner has not pleaded an excuse from the
statute of limitations or included the relevant information and exhibits from
the Grear declaration in the petition. Petitioner does not cite any authority
suggesting the court may consider this extrinsic evidence when considering a demurrer
based on the statute of limitations.
 
Accordingly, the
demurrer to the entire petition is SUSTAINED. 

 
Leave to Amend
 
A demurrer may be
sustained without leave to amend when there is no reasonable possibility that
the defect can be cured by amendment. (Blank v. Kirwan, supra, 39
Cal.3d 311, 318.)  Courts
generally allow at least one time to amend a complaint after sustaining a
demurrer.  (McDonald v. Superior Court (1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 297, 303.) In
assessing whether leave to amend should be granted, the burden is on the
complainant to show the court a pleading can be amended successfully. (Goodman v. 
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348-349.)  
 
This is the court’s first ruling on
demurrer, which weighs for granting leave to amend.  In addition, Petitioner has opposed the
demurrer and requested leave to amend. Based on the information provided in the
Grear declaration, Petitioner has made an offer of proof that arguably supports
a defense to the statute of limitations on the grounds the petition should be
deemed timely filed on September 21, 2023, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
sections 402, subdivision (a)(3) and/or 1010.6, subdivision (e)(4)(E).[3] As also suggested by
Petitioner, it may be able to amend the petition to state a defense to the
statute of limitations based on equitable tolling. Respondents argue Code of
Civil Procedure sections 402, subdivisions (a)(3), and 1010.6(e)(4)(E), and
equitable tolling do not provide a defense to the statute of limitations under
the circumstances of this case.
 
The court need not rule on the merits of
Petitioner’s defenses, or Respondents’ arguments in response, in order to grant
leave to amend. The court concludes only that Petitioner has shown at least
some reasonable possibility of successful amendment. Accordingly, the court
grants leave to amend. (See Kittredge
Sports Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048 [“even if
the proposed legal theory is a novel one, ‘the preferable practice would be to
permit the amendment and allow the parties to test its legal sufficiency by
demurrer, motion for judgment on the pleadings or other appropriate
proceedings’ ”].) Respondents may challenge any amendment to plead around the statute
of limitations in a subsequent demurrer or by other appropriate motion.  
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The demurrer is SUSTAINED WITH 21 DAYS LEAVE TO
AMEND.  
 
 IT IS SO ORDERED.
