And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion to appoint a receiver to enforce a shareholders' buyout settlement agreement (BOSA) for Jack Rubin & Sons, Inc. (JRS). The motion was brought by Plaintiffs Michael Rubin and Staci Rubin, who own 2/3 of JRS, and Defendant Bruce Rubin, who owns the remaining 1/3. The BOSA requires the appointment of a receiver to oversee the buyout process.

The judge has reviewed the parties' submissions and has made several findings. First, the judge has sustained various objections to declarations filed by the parties, including objections to the admissibility of evidence. Second, the judge has found that the parties' agreement to continue the evaluation process and to provide complete and accurate records to the evaluators is still in effect.

The judge has also requested that the parties address several issues in their next submission, including whether all data requested by the evaluators has been provided, whether any data is missing, and how the evaluators propose to proceed if data is missing. The judge has also asked the parties to submit a joint report on the master data list compiled by the evaluators, any efforts to obtain missing data, and how the evaluators propose to proceed if there is no further data that can be provided.

Finally, the judge has continued the hearing on the motion to April 19, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. The parties are asked to submit a joint report by April 12, 2024, and no further briefing will be accepted.
