And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This judge's tentative ruling addresses a dispute regarding the court's jurisdiction and the tolling of the statute of limitations in a case involving a public agency's determination that a project is not subject to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The public agency filed a notice of determination, and the court received the document with a confirmation of receipt. The court notes that the plaintiff's counsel employed Grear as a paralegal and that the notice was filed within the time period specified by CEQA. The court also references California Code of Civil Procedure sections 402 and 1010.6, which govern the filing of complaints and the tolling of the statute of limitations, respectively. The judge intends to clarify the court's jurisdiction and to toll the statute of limitations, pending further information or evidence presented at the future court hearing.
