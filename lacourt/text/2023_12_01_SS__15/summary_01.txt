And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion to compel further responses from Defendant Autozone West LLC to standard interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production. The court grants the motion in part, ordering Defendant to serve updated responses to standard interrogatories and produce any responsive documents that Plaintiffs do not have. The court also denies the motion in part, finding that Defendant's objections to certain requests for production are not proper. The court notes that general objections are not permitted in response to discovery requests and that Defendant's failure to specify the writings from which answers may be derived or ascertained is a violation of California Code of Civil Procedure, § 2030.230. The court sets a deadline of December 5, 2023, for Defendant to serve the updated responses and produce the responsive documents.
