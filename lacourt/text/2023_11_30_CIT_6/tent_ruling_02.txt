 Case Number:  23PSCV00835    Hearing Date:   November 30, 2023    Dept:  6 CASE NAME:  Staccia  Lee v. Thomas Harrison, et al. Defendants Thomas  Harrison and Thomas William Harrison’s Demurrer to Complaint  TENTATIVE RULING The Court OVERRULES  the demurrer to the Complaint. Defendants must file an Answer to the Complaint  within 20 days of the Court’s order.  Plaintiff is ordered  to give notice of the Court’s order and file proof of service of same within  five days of the Court’s order.BACKGROUND This  is an unlawful detainer action. On March 16, 2023, plaintiff Staccia Lee  (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendants Thomas Harrison, Thomas  William Harrison (collectively, Defendants), and Does 1 through 10 for unlawful  detainer.  On  October 30, 2023,  Defendants filed a demurrer to the Complaint. On November 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed  an opposition. On November 27, 2023, Defendants filed their reply.  LEGAL  STANDARD             A demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of  other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or  content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or  cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., § 422.10; see Donabedian v.  Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It is not the function  of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for  purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are  assumed to be true. (Id.)   A  demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the  pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially  noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian,  supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be  considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868,  881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting  demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal  v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider  contents of release not part of court record].)   A  demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete  or discloses some defense that would bar recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc.  v. Superior Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The “face of  the complaint” includes material contained in attached exhibits that are  incorporated by reference into the complaint, or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v.  Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s  Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as  surplusage the pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”])   A demurrer can only be sustained when it  disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.  (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)   PRELIMINARY ISSUES             Defendants  note in their reply that Plaintiff’s opposition is untimely because it was not  filed or served by November 15, 2023. The Court agrees. (See Code Civ. Proc., §  1005, subd. (b).) The Court also notes, however, that Defendants’ reply was not  filed or served by November 21, 2023, which was the deadline for their reply.  (See Id.) The proof of service attached to Plaintiff’s opposition  indicates that it was mail served to Defendants on November 16, 2023, so it is  unclear why it took Defendants until November 26, 2023 to file their reply.  Either way, the Court exercises its  discretion to still consider the opposition and reply, but admonishes both  parties to comply with the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure going  forward. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300(d); Juarez v. Wash Depot  Holdings, Inc. (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 1197, 1202.)              The Court also notes that Defendants  attached additional documents to their reply papers. Generally,  new evidence is not permitted on reply unless it fills in gaps in the evidence  created by the opposing party’s opposition and is not raising new substantive  issues for the first time; otherwise, a further hearing would be required to  permit the opposing party to respond. (Jay v. Mahaffey (2013) 218  Cal.App.4th 1522, 1537-1538.) Further, the Court does not consider exhibits  provided by the moving party in considering a demurrer. Moreover, the documents  attached to the Reply – 15-Day Notices to Pay or Quit-- were attached as  exhibits to the Complaint. Thus, the Court declines to consider Defendants’  exhibits.  DISCUSSION             Meet and Confer Per Code of Civil Procedure section  430.41, subdivision (a), Defendants were required to meet and confer before  bringing this demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) Defendants  provided no declaration indicating they attempted to meet and confer with  Plaintiff. (See Id., § 430.41, subd. (a)(3).) However, Plaintiff did not raise this issue  in the opposition. (Holden v. City of San Diego (2019)  43 Cal.App.5th 404, 418; C. Opposing the Motion—and Rebutting the Opposition,  Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 9(I)-C, ¶ 9:105.10.) Nevertheless,  the Court may not overrule the demurrer for failure to adequately meet and  confer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a)(4).) The Court will still  consider the demurrer, but admonishes Defendants to comply with these  requirements going forward.              Analysis             The Court notes a few form issues with Defendants’  demurrer. First, Defendants have not actually provided a  demurrer. Instead, they have provided a notice of demurrer and a memorandum of  points and authorities in support of a demurrer. (See A. Demurrers, Cal. Prac.  Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 7(I)-A [“The demurring party must file with  the court, and serve on the other party, the following: • Demurrer; •  Notice of Hearing (see ¶ 7:110 ff.); • Memorandum of Points and  Authorities; [CRC 3.1112(a)] • Proof of service. [CCP § 1005(b); CRC  3.1300(c)].” [emphasis added].) The demurrer is separate from the notice and  the memorandum of points and authorities. (See Id.)  Second, Defendants’ demurrer fails to comply with  Code of Civil Procedure section 430.60, which provides that, “[a] demurrer  shall distinctly specify the grounds upon which any of the objections to the  complaint, cross-complaint, or answer are taken. Unless it does so, it may  be disregarded.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.60) [emphasis added]. Defendants  fail to specify each ground upon which they demur to Plaintiff’s Complaint. It  is not enough that Defendants mention the grounds for the demurrer in the  memorandum of points and authorities. (See Id.)  Third, Defendants were required to specify in a  separate paragraph each ground for demurrer to the Complaint and the causes of  action contained therein. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1320, subd. (a) [“[e]ach  ground of demurrer must be in a separate paragraph and must state whether it  applies to the entire complaint, cross-complaint, or answer, or to specified  causes of action or defenses.”]) Defendants’ demurrer fails to comply with  these requirements.              Nevertheless, the Court exercises its discretion to still  consider Defendants’ demurrer, and admonishes them to comply with the  requirements for a demurrer set forth in the Code of Civil Procedure and the  California Rules of Court going forward.              Defendants contend the  Complaint fails to state a cause of action for unlawful detainer on the grounds  that the notice is defective because it demands rent for more than one year in  violation of Code of Civil Procedure section 1161, subdivision (2). Defendants  also contend the Complaint is subject to demurrer on the basis of uncertainty  since there are conflicting amounts of rent allegedly at issue plus different  termination notices. The Court agrees with Defendants regarding the excessive  demand for rent, but disagrees on the basis of uncertainty. The Court also  finds that Plaintiff has alleged an alternate, independent basis for unlawful  detainer here beyond the issue of nonpayment of rent.  To state a cause of action  for unlawful detainer based on nonpayment of rent, the plaintiff must allege facts  demonstrating, “’(1) the tenant is in possession of the premises; (2) that  possession is  without permission; (3) the tenant is in default for nonpayment  of rent; (4) the tenant has been properly served with a written three-day notice;  and (5) the default continues  after the three-day notice period has elapsed.’  [Citation.]” (Fitness Int'l, LLC v. KB Salt Lake III, LLC (2023) 95  Cal.App.5th 1032, 1045.)              Code of Civil Procedure section 1161, subdivision (2), provides  that, “[t]he notice may be served at any time within one year after the rent  becomes due.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1161, subd. (2).) The 15-day notice for  nonpayment of rent that Plaintiff served on Defendants seeks repayment of rent  between February 2020 and May 2021, which exceeds the one-year limit of Code of  Civil Procedure section 1161, subdivision (2). (Compl., Exs. 5-6.) This renders  the 15-day notice defective. (Bevill  v. Zoura (1994) 27  Cal.App.4th 694, 697-698; see also Foster v. Williams,  229 Cal.App.4th Supp. 9, 14, quoting Bevill, supra, at p. 697 [“A  valid three-day pay rent or quit notice is a prerequisite to an unlawful  detainer action. [Citations.] Because of the summary nature of an unlawful  detainer action, a notice is valid only if the lessor strictly complies with  the statutorily mandated notice requirements. [Citation.]”)  However, a plaintiff may also state a cause of action  for unlawful detainer based on no-fault just cause by alleging facts  demonstrating compliance with Civil Code section 1946.2, subdivision (b)(2),  which includes an owner’s withdrawal of real property from the rental market  for occupation by the owner. (See Civ. Code § 1946.2, subd. (b)(2)(A)(i).) The Court  finds the Complaint does clearly allege an independent basis for terminating  the tenancy with Defendants. Plaintiff alleges having also served a 60-day notice  of termination on Defendants on August 16, 2022 for no-fault just cause  eviction under Civil Code section 1946.2, subdivision (b)(2)(A)(i), and that  Defendants failed to vacate the subject property before the notice expired.  (Compl., ¶ 9, Exs. 2-3.) While the Court agrees with Defendants that  Plaintiff’s Complaint is not the paragon of pleading draftsmanship, the Court  nevertheless finds it sufficiently alleges an alternate basis for unlawful  detainer under Civil Code section 1946.2, subdivision (b)(2)(A)(i) to withstand  a demurrer for uncertainty. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 452; Perez v. Golden  Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238 [allegations liberally  construed in favor of plaintiff on demurrer].)  To the extent the Complaint alleges the 60-day notice  expired on August 16, 2022, the Complaint also contains a copy of the 60-day  notice, which shows that it was served on August 16, 2022 and thus would have expired  60 days thereafter by operation of law. (Compl., Exs. 2-3; Code Civ. Proc., §  1946.1, subd. (b); see also Moran v. Prime Healthcare  Mgmt., Inc. (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 1131, 1145-1146 [“While the  ‘allegations [of a complaint] must be accepted as true for purposes of  demurrer,’ the ‘facts appearing in exhibits attached to the complaint will also  be accepted as true and, if contrary to the allegations in the pleading, will  be given precedence.’ ”]) Attachment 14 to the Complaint also states that the  60-day period expired on or about October 17, 2022 and that Defendants failed  to vacate at the end of the 60 days. (Compl., Attachment 14.) Defendants  acknowledge in their reply that the 60-day notice would have expired on October  15, 2023. (Reply, 3:26-27.) Defendants’ moving papers and reply papers  otherwise fail to address any purported issues involving Plaintiff’s 60-day  notice of termination.  The  Court finds that the Complaint alleges sufficient facts to state a cause of  action for unlawful detainer based on the 60-day Notice to Quit. A demurrer can only be sustained when it disposes of an  entire cause of action. (Poizner, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at p. 119; Kong,  supra, 108 Cal.App.4th at p. 1046.)   Based  on the foregoing, the Court OVERRULES Defendants’ demurrer to the Complaint.  CONCLUSION The Court OVERRULES  the demurrer to the Complaint. Defendants must file an Answer to the Complaint  within 20 days of the Court’s order.  Plaintiff is ordered  to give notice of the Court’s order and file proof of service of same within  five days of the Court’s order.
