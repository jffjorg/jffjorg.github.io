And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Cri-Help, Inc. and 13 Individual Defendants to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by Timothy Goeke Jr. The Judge finds that the FAC is not sufficiently clear to apprise the Individual Defendants as to the issues they would need to address in a responsive pleading, and therefore sustains the demurrer for uncertainty as to the Individual Defendants with 20 days' leave to amend.

The Judge also sustains the demurrer to the second, third, and fourth causes of action without leave to amend, and sustains the demurrer to the fifth, seventh, eighth, and ninth causes of action with 20 days' leave to amend.

The Judge overrules Cri-Help's special demurrer for uncertainty, but finds that the FAC is insufficient to state a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, and sustains the demurrer to that cause of action with 20 days' leave to amend.

The Judge also sustains the demurrer to the sixth cause of action for declaratory relief, and sustains the demurrer to the ninth cause of action for fraud with 20 days' leave to amend.

The Judge orders that notice be given to all parties that the tentative ruling will become the final ruling of the court unless a party notifies the court of their intention to appear and argue at the hearing.
