English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the action, finding that the Sachs agreement does not cover the same time frame as the plaintiff's claims and that the claims do not perfectly overlap. The judge has also declined to grant the motion to dismiss without evidence supporting all the elements of res judicata. The judge has ordered the defendant to provide notice to the plaintiff and the court if they intend to argue the motion to dismiss.
