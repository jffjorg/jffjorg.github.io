And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendants' motion to vacate default judgment and set aside default. The judge finds that the service of process was improper because the defendants did not reside at the address where the process server left the documents. The judge also grants the defendants' motion to quash service of summons because the plaintiff failed to provide evidence of actual residency at the address where the process server left the documents. The judge sets an order to show cause (OSC) to require the plaintiff to provide proof of service and sets a case management conference for June 26, 2024.
