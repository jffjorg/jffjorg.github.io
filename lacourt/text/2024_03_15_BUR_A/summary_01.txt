And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the defendant's motion for attorney's fees in the amount of $42,340. The defendant, Tim Ditty, sought attorney's fees under California Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.420, which allows for the recovery of attorney's fees where a moving party has demonstrated that the opposing party denied a request for admission without a good faith belief that they would succeed at trial.

The judge found that the plaintiff, Rosemead Holdings, LLC, failed to admit that Ditty had no personal liability for a lease agreement between the parties, and that Ditty proved lack of personal liability at trial. The judge also found that the plaintiff did not demonstrate a reasonable belief in success at trial on the issue of Ditty's personal liability.

The judge awarded attorney's fees to Ditty because the plaintiff failed to admit the truth of the matter, and Ditty proved the truth of the matter at trial. The judge also granted the plaintiff's request for discovery sanctions in the amount of $1,530, finding that the plaintiff had failed to properly investigate the issue and had made unreasonable objections to the defendant's discovery requests.

The judge's ruling is tentative until all parties have waived notice or until the judge elects to sign a formal order.
