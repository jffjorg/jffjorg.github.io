And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants Melise Vartanians' motion for leave to amend her complaint. The plaintiff seeks to add an additional cause of action for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress and to add further facts to the Negligence cause of action. The judge finds that the plaintiff has satisfied the requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1324(a) and (b), and that the proposed amended complaint is sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff's obligation under these rules. The judge notes that the discovery process has illuminated the potential for the additional claim and that allowing the plaintiff to file the amended complaint will increase the likelihood of the case being resolved efficiently on the merits. The defendants have not opposed the motion, indicating their acquiescence that the motion is meritorious. The judge orders that the plaintiff file her first amended complaint within 10 days, unless all parties waive notice.
