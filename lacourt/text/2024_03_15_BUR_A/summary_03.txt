Summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the motion to compel arbitration filed by Plaintiff Kristina Hoekstra against Cross-Defendants James and Annette Volken. The ruling holds that Plaintiff has waived her right to arbitrate her claims against Cross-Defendants due to unreasonable delay in demanding arbitration. The Court finds that Plaintiff's delay in filing the motion to compel arbitration, despite being aware of her claims against Cross-Defendants, is a significant factor in determining waiver. The ruling also notes that the arbitration clause in the agreement between Plaintiff and Cross-Defendants explicitly elects the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) as governing any motions to compel arbitration.
