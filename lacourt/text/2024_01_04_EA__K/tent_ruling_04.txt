Discussion
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
Plaintiff has not provided the court with the original
promissory note or explained why the court should accept a copy of same in lieu
thereof. Pursuant to California Rules of Court Rule 3.1806, “[i]n all cases in
which a judgment is rendered upon a written obligation to pay money, the clerk
must, at the time of entry of judgment, unless otherwise ordered, note over the
clerk’s official signature and across the face of the writing the fact of
rendition of judgment with the date of the judgment and the title of the court
and the case.”
