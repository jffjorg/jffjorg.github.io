Discussion
Tung
& Associates, APLC (“Firm”) seeks to be relieved as counsel of
record for Plaintiff Yutao Jiang (“Client”).
The court has discretion to allow an attorney
to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided that there is no
prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.
(See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince
(1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.)
California
Rule of Court (“CRC”) Rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice of motion and motion
directed to the client (made on the Notice
of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the
confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of
Civil Procedure § 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under section
284(1) (made on the Declaration in
Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form
(MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and
the proposed order on the client and on all other parties who have appeared in
the case; and (4) a proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). The court may delay the effective
date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the
signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
Attorney
Ashton Watkins (“Watkins”) represents that Client became dissatisfied with
counsel and terminated his relationship with Firm in April 2023. Client
personally appeared at the April 18, 2023 hearing and spoke for himself with
the assistance of a Mandarin interpreter. The court noted, at that time, that
Client “may represent himself or retain new counsel if not satisfied with
current counsel.” (Exh. A). Watkins represents that Client is still
dissatisfied with counsel but has failed to sign a substitution of attorney
form or retain new counsel. Watkins represents that there has been a breakdown
in the attorney-client relationship such that Firm can no longer represent
Client in this action.
Watkins
states that he has served Client by mail at Client’s last known address with
copies of the motions served with this declaration and that he has confirmed,
within the past 30 days, that the address is current, namely by having his
legal assistant confirm same during this time frame, as well as confirm
Client’s email and telephone number.
The
court determines that the requirements of Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 enumerated
above have
been sufficiently met.
Accordingly,
the motion is granted, effective upon the filing of the
proof of service
showing service of the signed order upon
the Client at the Client’s last known address.
