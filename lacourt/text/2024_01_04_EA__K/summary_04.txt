And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The plaintiff, Cathay Bank, has filed an application for default judgment against Joyful Worldwide Inc. (JWI) and Yong Hoon Lee. The plaintiff alleges that JWI failed to pay the principal amount of $50,000.00 when it matured on November 1, 2022, and that Lee executed a continuing commercial guaranty. The court has reviewed the application and has noted several defects. Specifically, the plaintiff has not provided the original promissory note or explained why the court should accept a copy of the note in lieu of the original. Therefore, the court denies the plaintiff's application for default judgment without prejudice. An order to show cause re: default judgment is set for January 4, 2024.
