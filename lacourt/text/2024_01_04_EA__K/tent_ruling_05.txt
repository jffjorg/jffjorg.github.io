Michael O’Hare (“O’Hare”), Plaintiff’s Recovery
Resolution Group, Manager | Vice President Credit Resolution Group,
authenticates the HH Loan Agreement, Abukhadra Guaranty
#1, HH Note (collectively, “HH Loan Documents”), FWMT Loan Agreement, Abukhadra
Guaranty #2, FWMT Note (collectively, “FWMT Loan Documents”) and the Abukhadra
Credit Card Guaranty and attests that HH and Abukhadra defaulted with respect
to the HH Loan Documents “[a]s of October 3, 2022” (O’Hare Decl., ¶ 8; see also
¶ 12) and with respect to the FWMT Loan Documents “[a]s of October 3, 2022” (Id.,
¶ 16; see also ¶ 19); however, it is unclear to the court whether any payments
were made with respect to the HH Loan Documents and/or FWMT Loan Documents and
if so, when and in what amount. Plaintiff is requested to provide statements of
account with respect to the HH Loan Documents and the FWMT Loan Documents, to
the extent they exist. Attorney Rosaline Ayoub (“Ayoub”) has attested that “FCB
has informed me that since Defendants’ default and the serving of the
Complaint, Defendants have not made payments and continue to remain in default”
(Ayoub Decl., ¶ 18); however, she clearly does not have personal knowledge of
the foregoing information.
