  Case Number:  19PSCV01127    Hearing Date:   January 4, 2024    Dept:  K Defendant Nhuan Gia
Huynh’s Motion for Attorney Fees is GRANTED, in the reduced amount of $29,172.75.
Background   
Plaintiff Cal World El Monte, LLC (“Plaintiff”)
alleges as follows:
AMCA I, LLC (“AMCA”) was
the owner of the commercial property located at 10138 E. Garvey Ave., El Monte,
CA 91733 (“Property”). The Property is a “strip mall” consisting of several
units which were occupied by businesses owned by Brian Lai (“B. Lai”) (i.e.,
Central Furniture and Home Store [“Central Furniture”] and Yes 98 Cents, LLC [“Yes
98 Cents”].). B. Lai is believed to be the sole member of AMCA. B. Lai, acting
as a listing broker, listed the Property for sale; the listing advertisement
stated that Yes 98 Cents was the anchor tenant of the Property. During or about
April 2014, after seeing the commercial listing, Plaintiff’s representative
Gary Tsai (“Tsai”) contacted B. Lai regarding Plaintiff’s interest in the
Property; thereafter AMCA and Plaintiff began negotiations for the purchase of
the Property, including assignment of the lease agreements with Yes 98 Cents
and Liu/Central Furniture (which had been executed by Pau Cun Liu (“Liu”) on
behalf of Yes 98 Cents and by Doe 2 on behalf of Central Furniture). B. Lai
made several representations to Tsai regarding the Property’s rental income,
including providing rental agreements and operation statements for 2012-2014. B.
Lai concealed his ownership interests in Yes 98 Cents and Central Furniture. On
or about April 22, 2014, AMCA and Plaintiff entered into a purchase agreement
for the sale of the Property in the amount of $5,525,000.00, which included
AMCA’s assignment of the rental agreements for the Property. Central Furniture
and 98 Cents thereafter vacated the Property. When Plaintiff’s representative
went to the City of El Monte (“City”) to search for prior City-approved
construction plans on or about October 3, 2019, the representative located the
Certificates of Occupancy for the Property from June 2004 to the present, which
showed B. Lai’s ownership interests in Yes 98 Cents and Central Furniture.
On April 8, 2020, Liu’s default was
entered. On May 18, 2020, Central Furniture’s default was entered. On July 30,
2020, Plaintiff filed two “Amendment[s] to Complaint,” wherein Nhuan Gia Huynh (“Nhuan”)
was substituted in lieu of Doe 1 and Hong Gia Huynh (“Hong”) was substituted in
lieu of Doe 2.
On January 6, 2021, Plaintiff filed a
Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”), asserting causes of action against B. Lai,
AMCA, Yes 98 Cents, Central Furniture, Liu, Maggie Lo Huynh (“Maggie”) and Does
1-25 for:
1.                 
Fraudulent Inducement Into Contract
2.                 
Negligent Misrepresentation
3.                 
Breach of Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing
4.                 
Unfair and Deceptive Business Practices (Bus. & Prof.
Code § 17200 et seq.)
On October 3, 2023, an “Order
Granting Defendant Doe 1 (Nhuan G. Huynh) Motion for Mandatory Dismissal for
Failure to Serve Complaint Within Three Years of Filing the Action Pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure, §§ 583.210, 583.250” was entered.
A Final Status Conference is set for June 13, 2024. Trial is
set for July 16, 2024.
Legal Standard
“In any action on a contract, where the contract
specifically provides that attorney's fees and costs, which are incurred to
enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the
prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing
on the contract, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or
not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees in addition to other
costs…” (Civil Code § 1717, subd. (a).)
“The court, upon notice and motion by a party, shall
determine who is the party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this
section, whether or not the suit proceeds to final judgment. Except as provided
in paragraph (2), the party prevailing on the contract shall be the party who
recovered a greater relief in the action on the contract. The court may also
determine that there is no party prevailing on the contract for purposes of
this section…” (Civil Code § 1717, subd. (b)(1).)
Discussion
Nhuan moves the court, per Civil Code § 1717, for an award
of attorney’s fees against Plaintiff in the amount of $39,702.75[1].
Request for Judicial Notice

Merits
1.         Entitlement
to Fees
Nhuan asserts
that he is entitled to attorney’s fees pursuant to ¶ 26 of the Commercial
Property Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”) attached as Exhibit “H” to
Plaintiff’s SAC, which reads as follows:
             ATTORNEY FEES: In any action,
proceeding, or arbitration between Buyer
and Seller arising out of this Agreement, the prevailing
Buyer or Seller shall be 
entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs from the
non-prevailing Buyer or 
Seller, except as provided in paragraph 34A[2]. (RJN, Exh. 1(H); Levine Decl., ¶ 4, Exh. A.)
Plaintiff alleged that it entered into the Purchase
Agreement with AMCA for the sale of the Property in the amount of
$5,525,000.00, which included AMCA’s assignment of the rental agreements for
the Property. (RJN, Exh. 1, ¶ 32). Plaintiff sued Nhuan for, inter alia,
Breach of Duty of Good Faith & Fair Dealing, alleging that he was an alter
ego and acted, jointly and severally, as the agent of the other defendants. (Id.,
¶¶ 13 and 72). Plaintiff alleged, inter alia, that “Defendants’ conduct
. . . unfairly interfered with Plaintiffs ability to receive the benefits under
the Purchase Agreement . . . in breach the implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing that exists in the Purchase Agreement.” (Id., ¶ 76).
Plaintiff sought attorney’s fees against all defendants in ¶ 5 of its prayer
for relief.
“As a general rule, [contractual] attorney fees are awarded
only when the lawsuit is between signatories to the contract. However, under
some circumstances, the Civil Code section 1717 reciprocity principles will be
applied in actions involving signatory and nonsignatory parties,” including
“where the nonsignatory party ‘stands in the shoes of a party to the
contract.’” (Cargill, Inc. v. Souza (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 962, 966
[citation omitted].)
In Reynolds Metals Co. v. Alperson (1979) 25 Cal.3d
124, Plaintiff brought an action against two shareholders and directors (together,
“defendants”) of two bankrupt corporations, seeking to hold them liable for
debts owed plaintiff by the corporations (which included two unpaid promissory
notes) via an alter ego theory of liability. The promissory notes, which
provided for the recovery of attorney fees, had not been signed by defendants.
The trial court rejected the alter ego theory and awarded defendants
attorney fees. The California Supreme Court recognized that defendants, though
nonsignatories to the promissory notes, would have been liable for attorney
fees pursuant to the fees provision in the promissory notes had plaintiff
prevailed, were entitled to recover attorney fees under Civil Code § 1717 since
they prevailed. (Id. at 129).
Nhuan acknowledges that he is not a
signatory to the Purchase Agreement, but argues that he is nevertheless
entitled to attorney’s fees as the prevailing party pursuant to Reynolds.
Plaintiff, in turn, contends that Reynolds is distinguishable from
instant matter because “there is no contractual cause of action in the SAC, and
Plaintiff is only seeking relief under tort causes of action.” (Opp., 3:6-7).
Plaintiff’s argument, however, overlooks the fact that it sued Nhuan for Breach
of Duty of Good Faith & Fair Dealing.
Next, Plaintiff contends that Reynolds is
inapplicable because attorneys fees were awarded to defendants after trial,
whereas no trial occurred in the instant matter. Civil Code § 1717, subdivision
(b)(1), however, allows a party to qualify as a “prevailing party” “whether or
not the suit proceeds to final judgment.” Further, an “Order Granting Defendant
Doe 1 (Nhuan G. Huynh) Motion for Mandatory Dismissal for Failure to Serve
Complaint Within Three Years of Filing the Action Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure, §§ 583.210, 583.250” was entered here on October 3, 2023. (Levine
Reply Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. A). Code of Civil Procedure § 581d provides, in relevant
part, that “[a]ll
dismissals ordered by the court shall be in the form of a written order signed
by the court and filed in the action and those orders when so filed shall
constitute judgments and be effective for all purposes . . .”
Finally, Plaintiff asserts that Nhuan is not a “prevailing
party” because he “has not received a net monetary recovery” and because “the
dismissal was a result of Plaintiff’s inability to serve the summons and
complaint within the 3-year statute, which cannot be construed as dismissal in
his favor.” (Opp., 4:1-5). Plaintiff has not provided the court with any legal
authority for its position. Further, the court of appeal in Elms v. Builders
Disbursements, Inc. (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 671 held that a defendant sued on
a contract entitling a successful litigant to attorney’s fees Civil Code § 1717
may recover such fees where plaintiff’s action is dismissed because it was not
brought to trial within five years; in doing so, the court looked to the
“pragmatic inquiry” undertaken by the court in Winick Corp. v. Safeco
Insurance Co. (1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1502, wherein defendant was awarded
attorney’s fees as a prevailing party under former Civil Code § 3250 because it
successfully obtained a dismissal of the plaintiff’s action for failure to
serve and return summons within three years pursuant to former Code of Civil
Procedure § 581a. The Winick court reasoned that “The most Safeco—or any
other civil defendant—ordinarily can hope to achieve is to have the plaintiff’s
claim thrown out completely. This is exactly what happened here. . . In any practical
sense of the word, the defendant ‘prevailed.’” (Id. at 674-675, quoting Winnick,
supra, 187 Cal. App.3d at 1508).
The court determines that Nhuan is entitled to attorney’s
fees as the “prevailing party” pursuant to Civil Code § 1717.
2.         Reasonableness of Fees
The court turns to the issue of the reasonableness of the
fees sought. “[T]rial courts have broad discretion in determining the amount of
a reasonable attorney's fee award. This determination is necessarily ad hoc and
must be resolved on the particular circumstances of each case.” (Meister v. Regents of University of
California (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th
437, 452.) “Trial judges are entrusted with this discretionary determination
because they are in the best position to assess the value of the professional
services rendered in their courts.” (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008)
165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.)
“[O]nce a party has established he or she is entitled to
fees, the lodestar method is generally presumed to be the starting point in
analyzing the appropriate amount of attorney fees. Under this method, a court
first calculates the number of hours reasonably spent multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate for each billing professional, and then may adjust the
amount based on various relevant factors to ensure the fee reflects the fair
market value [of the attorney services] for the particular action. (K.I. v. Wagner (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th
1412, 1425 [quotation marks and citations omitted].)
a.                 
Reasonableness
of Hourly Rates 
 
“In determining
hourly rates, the court must look to the prevailing market rates in the
relevant community. The rates of comparable attorneys in the forum district are
usually used. In making its calculation, the court should also consider the
experience, skill, and reputation of the attorney requesting fees. The court
may rely on its own knowledge and familiarity with the legal market in setting
a reasonable hourly rate.” (Heritage
Pacific Financial, LLC v. Monroy (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 972, 1009 [internal
quotations and citations omitted].)
The hourly rates in
this matter are set forth as follows:
Peter K. Levine (“Levine”) attorney - $750.00
            Roberto Segovia (“Segovia”),
paralegal - $175.00 
Plaintiff, in
response, points out that the billing records attached to the motion reflect a
reduced attorney fee rate of $550.00. Based on plaintiff’s argument, the
court’s own experience and knowledge, and the experience and qualifications of
counsel as set forth in Levine’s declaration, finds that a reduction of Levine’s hourly rate from $750.00 to
$550.00 is appropriate here.
b.                 
Reasonableness of Time Incurred 
 
“[T]he verified time statements of the attorneys, as
officers of the court, are entitled to credence in the absence of a clear
indication the records are erroneous.” (Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th
359, 396.) “In challenging attorney fees as excessive because too many hours of
work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging party to point to the
specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the
evidence. General arguments that fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or
unrelated do not suffice.” (Premier
Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. (2008)
163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)
Levine represents that he has expended 52.65 hours
(including 4 hours preparing the reply) and that Segovia has expended an
additional 1.23 hours on this matter. Plaintiff argues that the billing records
do not separate as between which tasks or entries pertain to Nhuan versus Yes
98 Cents, LLC (which are both represented by Levine). The court, however, is
satisfied after reviewing the billing records that the fees requested are
related to Levine’s efforts to first set aside Nhuan’s default and then have Nhuan
dismissed.
c.                  
Negative Multiplier 
Plaintiff asserts
that a negative multiplier should be applied. “[T]he lodestar. . . may be
adjusted by the court based on factors including, . . . (1) the novelty and
difficult of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting
them, (3) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other
employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award. The
purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market value for the
particular action. In effect, the court determines, retrospectively, whether
the litigation involved a contingent risk or required extraordinary legal skill
justifying augmentation of the unadorned lodestar in order to approximate the
fair market rate for such services.” (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1131-1132.)
The court
determines that Plaintiff has not articulated any basis warranting the
imposition of a negative multiplier.       
3.         Conclusion
The motion is granted, in the reduced amount of $29,172.75.
