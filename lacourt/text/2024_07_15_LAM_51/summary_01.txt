And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Upinder S. Kalra regarding a motion to set aside/vacate a judgment in the case of Pearl Beta Funding, LLC v. Lonewolf Insurance Services, et al. The motion is made by Judgment Debtors Three Zero Four Zero Two Holding, LLC and Tatanisha Leer, who argue that the judgment should be set aside because the amount fails to credit amounts of the judgment already paid and the motion to amend the judgment was not properly served. The court has continued the motion to allow the parties to provide further briefing. The court notes that the applicable statute is CCP § 1710.40, which provides that a judgment entered pursuant to this chapter may be vacated on any ground which would be a defense to an action in this state on the sister state judgment, including the ground that the amount of interest accrued on the sister state judgment and included in the judgment entered pursuant to this chapter is incorrect. The court also notes that service of the notice of entry of judgment must be done in the manner provided for service of summons and must inform the judgment debtor that they have 30 days within which to make a motion to vacate the judgment.
