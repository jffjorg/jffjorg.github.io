LEGAL STANDARD: 
 
Set Aside CCP §¿473
 
“The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a
party or his or her legal representative from a judgment, dismissal, order, or
other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect…¿ [The application]¿shall be made
within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment,
dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.”¿ (CCP¿§¿473(b).) Courts must grant
relief when the attorney’s inexcusable neglect results in the dismissal. (Ibid.) Otherwise, relief under this
section is discretionary. (Ibid.)
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d),
provides that the Court may, on motion of either party after notice set aside
any void judgment or order.  
 
Request
for Judicial Notice
 
The court grants Judgment Creditor’s
request for judicial notice as to Exhibits A through J. (Evid. Code §
452(c), (h); See Kalnoki v. First
American Trustee Servicing Solutions, LLC (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 23,37.)
However, the court only takes judicial notice of the foregoing documents only
as to “the existence, content and authenticity of public records and other
specified documents”; it does not take judicial notice of the truth of the
factual matters asserted in those documents. (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.)¿¿ 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
Moving Parties contend the judgment should be set aside
because the amount fails to credit amounts of the judgment already paid and the
motion to amend the judgment was not properly served. Plaintiff argues Moving
Parties have not demonstrated, or even suggested, prejudice.
 
As a threshold matter, CCP §¿473 does not afford the relief Moving
Parties seek. (Conseco Marketing, LLC v.
IFA & Ins. Services, Inc. (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 831, 844 [noting that
a CCP § 473.5 motion is a procedural remedy to set aside a default or default
judgment, not a sister state judgment.])
 
The more
applicable statute is CCP § 1710.40 which provides, in pertinent part: 
 
“(a) A
judgment entered pursuant to this chapter may be vacated on any ground which
would be a defense to an action in this state on the sister state judgment,
including the ground that the amount of interest accrued on the sister state
judgment and included in the judgment entered pursuant to this chapter is
incorrect. 
 
(b) Not later than 30 days after service of notice of entry
of judgment pursuant to¿Section 1710.30, proof of which has been made in
the manner provided by Article 5 (commencing with¿Section 417.10) of Chapter 4 of Title 5 of Part
2, the judgment debtor, on written notice to the judgment creditor, may make a
motion to vacate the judgment under this section.”  
 
Service, not “actual notice,” triggers the 30-day limit for
the judgment debtor to make a motion to vacate the judgment so long as the
judgment debtor was effectively served with process in the sister state action.
(Conseco Marketing, LLC, supra, at p.
838.) However, service of the notice of entry of judgment must be done “in the
manner provided for service of summons” and “shall . . . inform the judgment
debtor that the judgment debtor has 30 days within which to make a motion to
vacate the judgment.” (Ibid.) 
 
Here, Plaintiff did not adequately serve notice of entry of
the amended judgment on the Wyoming LLC.[2]
 First, Plaintiff effected service via
U.S. Mail only. (Notice of Entry of Amended Judgment, Proof of Service.) This
is not one of the proscribed methods for service of summons. (CCP § 415.10(a)
[personal delivery], § 415.20 [substitute service], or §
415.30(a) [service by
mail with a notice and acknowledgment of receipt].) Second, the notice does not
inform the judgment debtor that they have 30 days within which to make the
instant motion. (Conseco Marketing, LLC,
supra, at p. 838.) 
 
Accordingly, the court CONTINUES the instant motion to allow
the parties the opportunity to provide further briefing.
 
CONCLUSION:
 
            For
the foregoing reasons, the Court decides the pending motion as follows: 
 
1.      Motion
for Order Setting Aside/Vacating Judgment is CONTINUED to September 3, 2024.
The parties shall submit additional briefing consistent with the requirements
of CCP § 1005(b).
Moving party is to give notice. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.
