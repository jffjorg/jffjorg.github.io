And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is tentatively ruling that the motion to amend the judgment is not valid. This is because the original judgment was properly served on Tatanisha Leer, who is not a judgment debtor. The notice of amended judgment was served via U.S. Mail, which is not sufficient to ensure proper service. Additionally, the proof of service for the motion to amend the judgment may be defective, as it was not served on the remaining unnamed defendants. The judge also notes that the timing of the filing of the motion, 56 days after service of the notice of entry of judgment, is inconsequential.
