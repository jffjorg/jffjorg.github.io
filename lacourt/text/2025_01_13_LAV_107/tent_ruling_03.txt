COURT’S [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:
Demurrer without Motion to Strike
 
 



 
[Tentative]
Sustain the demurrer and grant Cross-Complainants leave to amend.

I.               
BACKGROUND 
 
On September 30, 2022, Plaintiff James Hansen,
individually and derivatively on behalf of WJA Management, Inc., (“Plaintiff”) filed
a complaint against Allen Eggers and Does 1 through 50, alleging six causes of
action. 
On March 12, 2024, Allen Eggers, individually and as
Trustee for the Eggers Living Trust dated September 22, 1992, and WJA
Management, Inc. (“Cross-Complainants”) filed a cross-complaint against
Cross-Defendants Western Jet Aviation, James E. Hansen, Patricia A. Hansen, and
Roes 1 through 30, alleging causes of action for: (1) breach of contract; (2)
open book account; (3) account stated; (4) reasonable value of services; (5)
breach of fiduciary duty; and (6) declaratory relief. 
The cross-complaint alleges that Western Jet Aviation
(“Cross-Defendant”) entered into a management contract with WJA Management.
(Cross-Complaint ¶¶ 14, 33.) On
May 30, 2019, WJA Holdings, LLC, Hansen, and Cross-Defendant’s shareholders
entered into a stock sale agreement. (Cross-Complaint ¶ 16.) At the time of the
stock sale agreement, Cross-Defendant owed WJA Management, Inc., $700,000 for
services rendered between June 1, 2018, and May 30, 2019. (Cross-Complaint ¶
22.) WJA Management continued to provide services to Cross-Defendant until
November 8, 2019. (Cross-Complaint ¶ 22.) On January 27, 2023, Eggers,
individually and derivatively on behalf of WJA Management commenced an action
in the Second Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada against
Cross-Defendant, Hansen, and others. (Cross-Complaint ¶ 24.) On March 3, 2023,
Cross-Defendant removed the Nevada Action to the United States District Court
for the District of Nevada. (Cross-Complaint ¶ 26.) On March 6, 2023, Eggers
voluntarily dismissed Cross-Defendant from the Nevada Action. (Cross-Complaint
¶ 27.) The Nevada Action was later remanded back to the Second Judicial
District Court of the State of Nevada and on October 10, 2023, Hansen’s motion
to dismiss was granted. (Cross-Complaint ¶ 28.) The cross-complaint alleges
that the statute of limitations on the current action was tolled while the
Nevada Action was pending. (Cross-Complaint ¶¶ 29-30.)
On March 18, 2024, Defendant Allen Eggers demurred to
the complaint. On April 30, 2024, this court sustained the demurrer and granted
Plaintiff leave to amend. (04/30/24 Minute Order p. 6.)
 On May 23, 2024, Plaintiff filed a first
amended complaint against Defendants Allen Eggers and Does 1 through 50, and Nominal
Defendant WJA Management, Inc., alleging six causes of action for: (1)
Corporations Code sections 2004, 2005, and 2009; (2) accounting; (3) breach of
fiduciary duty; (4) conversion; (5) unjust enrichment; and (6) constructive
fraud.
On December
18, 2024, Cross-Defendant Western Jet Aviation, Inc. (“Cross-Defendant”) demurred
to the cross-complaint. No opposition has been filed.
II.            
CROSS-DEFENDANT’S REQUEST
FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
Cross-Defendant requests this court take judicial
notice of documents filed in the Nevada Action. The court may take judicial
notice of “Records of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record of
the United States or of any state of the United States.” (Evid. Code §
452(d).)
Thus, this court grants Cross-Defendant’s
requests for judicial notice.
III.          
PROCEDURAL MATTERS
 

Timeliness

“A person against whom a complaint or
cross-complaint has been filed may, within 30 days after service of the
complaint or cross-complaint, demur to the complaint or cross-complaint.” (Code
Civ. Proc., §¿430.40(a).)¿
 
Per
California Code of Civil Procedure section¿1005,
subdivision (b), moving papers should be filed at least 16 court days before
they are set for hearing, oppositions thereto should be filed at least nine
court days before the set hearing, and replies to any oppositions should be
filed at least five court days before the set hearing.” “If a document may be served by mail, express
mail, overnight delivery, or facsimile transmission, electronic service of that
document is deemed complete at the time of the electronic transmission of the
document or at the time that the electronic notification of service of the
document is sent.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010.6(a)(3)(A).)
 
Cross-Defendant
was served with the cross-complaint by personal service on June 14, 2024.
(Proof of Service filed 06/17/24.) Cross-Defendant filed and served
Cross-Complainants with the demurrer on December 18, 2024. (Demurrer pdf p.
15.) Accordingly, the demurrer is untimely under Code of Civil Procedure
section 430.40(a). 
 
Judges
have discretion as to whether to consider or strike an untimely demurrer or
pleading. (McAllister v. County of Monterey (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 253,
281.) This court will exercise its discretion and consider the demurrer.
 

Meet
     and Confer

 
California Code of Civil Procedure section¿430.41,
subdivision (a) requires parties to “meet and confer” before the filing of a
demurrer to attempt to informally resolve the objections raised in the
demurrer.¿The demurring party is required to file and serve with the demurrer a
declaration either confirming that parties were unable to resolve the issues
raised by the demurrer despite having met and conferred or that the opposing
party failed to meet and confer with the demurring party in good faith. (Code Civ.
Proc. §¿430.41(a)(3).)¿
 
Cross-Defendant’s counsel submits a
declaration stating counsel met and conferred with Cross-Complainants’ counsel
by telephone, Cross-Complainant’s counsel did not believe the statute of
limitations barred the claims, and stated “Mr. Eggers would take over the
defense of the matter and there was no need to file a demurrer.” (Avva
Declaration ¶ 3.)
¿ 
Accordingly, this court finds that Cross-Defendant
satisfied the meet and confer requirement.
 
IV.          
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the
pleading alone, and not the evidence or the facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc.
v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such,
the court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied
factual allegations. (Id.) The only issue a demurrer is concerned with
is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v.
Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 745.)¿A complaint is sufficient if it
contains “[a]¿statement¿of the¿facts¿constituting the cause of action, in
ordinary and concise language.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §¿425.10(a)(1).) Under
this standard, a “complaint ordinarily is sufficient if it alleges ultimate
rather than evidentiary facts.” (Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42
Cal.4th 531, 550.)¿
 
A party may demur to a cross-complaint because the cross-complaint
“does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.10(e).)¿ 
 
V.             
DISCUSSION
 

Breach
     of Contract

 
Cross-Defendant argues the breach
of contract cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations. (Demurrer
p. 3.)
 
“’An action upon any contract,
obligation, or liability founded upon an instrument in writing’ carries a
four-year statute of limitations.” (JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. v. Ward (2019)
33 Cal.App.5th 678, 686.)
 
The cross-complaint alleges that
“[f]or the fiscal year ending May 31, 2019, the management fee due to [WJA
Management] was $700,000 and recorded on the books of [Cross-Defendant] and
[WJA Management.]” (Cross-Complaint ¶ 35.)
 
Accordingly, the cross-complaint
alleges the breach of contract cause of action accrued on May 31, 2019, meaning
Cross-Complainants had until May 31, 2023, to bring this action. The
cross-complaint was filed on March 12, 2024. Thus, unless the statute of
limitations was tolled, the breach of contract cause of action is barred by the
statute of limitations.
 

Open
     Book Account

 


Statute of Limitations


 
Cross-Defendant argues the open
book account cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations. (Demurrer
p. 3.)
 
“Under California law, a four-year
statute of limitations applies to actions for . . . open book account.” (Professional
Collection Consultants v. Lauron (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 958, 966.) “Actions
to recover on an account stated or a book account accrue on the date of the
last item or entry in the account.” (Id.)
 
The cross-complaint alleges that WJA
Holdings, LLC, Hansen, and Cross-Defendant’s shareholders entered into the
stock sale agreement on May 30, 2019. (Cross-Complaint ¶ 16.) At that time, Cross-Defendant
owed WJA Management $700,000 for management services. (Cross-Complaint ¶ 22.)
WJA Management then continued to provide management services to Cross-Defendant
until November 8, 2019. (Cross-Complaint ¶ 22.) 
 
Accordingly, the cross-complaint
alleges that the open book account accrued either on May 30, 2019, or on
November 8, 2019, meaning Cross-Complainants had until – at the latest –
November 8, 2023, to bring this action. The cross-complaint was filed on March
12, 2024. Thus, unless the statute of limitations was tolled, the open book
account cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations.
 


Cause of Action


 
Cross-Defendant argues the
cross-complaint does not sufficiently allege an open book account cause of
action because it does not allege WJA Management “kept an account of the debits
and credits involved in the transactions.” (Demurrer p. 8.)
 
The elements of an open book
account cause of action are: (1) plaintiff and defendant had financial
transactions; (2) plaintiff kept an account of the debits and credits involved
in the transactions; (3) defendant owes plaintiff money on the account; and (4)
the amount of money that the defendant owes the plaintiff. (State Comps.
Insurance Fund v. ReadyLink Healthcare, Inc. (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 422,
449.)
 
The cross-complaint alleges that
WJA Management and Cross-Defendant had a contract where WJA Management managed
“certain aspects of [Cross-Defendant] for compensation.” (Cross-Complaint ¶
14.) The cross-complaint also alleges that WJA Management provided management
services between June 1, 2018, and May 30, 2019, and Cross-Defendant owes WJA
Management $700,000 for those services. (Cross-Complaint ¶ 22.) Thus, the
cross-complaint alleges that Cross-Defendant and WJA Management had financial
transactions. 
 
The cross-complaint also alleges
that “there existed an open book account between [WJA Management] and
[Cross-Defendant] for the management fee then due” but it does not specifically
allege that WJA Management kept an account of the debits and credits involved
in the transactions. (Cross-Complaint ¶ 40.) Thus, the cross-complaint has not
sufficiently alleged that WJA Management kept an account of the debits and
credits involved in the transactions.
 
The cross-complaint alleges that
Cross-Defendant “has failed to pay the amount due on the open book account in
the sum of $700,000.” (Cross-Complaint ¶ 41.) Thus, the cross-complaint alleges
that Cross-Defendant owes WJA Management money on the account and the amount of
money that Cross-Defendant owes WJA Management. 
 
Thus, because Cross-Complainants
have not specifically alleged it kept an account of the debits and credits
involved in the transactions, Cross-Complainants have not sufficiently alleged
a cause of action for open book account. This court sustains the demurrer on
this ground.
 

Account
     Stated

 


Statute of Limitations


 
Cross-Defendant argues the account
stated cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations. (Demurrer p.
4.)
 
“Under California law, a four-year
statute of limitations applies to actions for . . . account stated[.]” (Professional
Collection Consultants v. Lauron, supra, 8 Cal.App.5th at p. 966.) “Actions
to recover on an account stated or a book account accrue on the date of the
last item or entry in the account.” (Id.)
 
The cross-complaint alleges that “[t]his
is a cause of action for non-payment of an account stated for management
services rendered to [Cross-Defendant] by [WJA Management].” (Cross-Complaint ¶
43.) The cross-complaint also alleges that WJA Holdings, LLC, Hansen, and
Cross-Defendant’s shareholders entered into the stock sale agreement on May 30,
2019. (Cross-Complaint ¶ 16.) At that time, Cross-Defendant owed WJA Management
$700,000 for management services. (Cross-Complaint ¶ 22.) WJA Management then
continued to provide management services to Cross-Defendant until November 8,
2019. (Cross-Complaint ¶ 22.) 
 
Accordingly, the cross-complaint
alleges that the account stated cause of action accrued either on May 30, 2019,
or on November 8, 2019, meaning Cross-Complainants had until – at the latest –
November 8, 2023, to bring this action. The cross-complaint was filed on March
12, 2024. Thus, unless the statute of limitations was tolled, the open book
account cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations.
 


Cause of Action


 
Cross-Defendant argues the
cross-complaint does not sufficiently allege an account stated cause of action
because it does not allege “that [Cross-Defendant] ever agreed that a
particular amount was the ‘correct sum owing’ from [Cross-Defendant] to WJA
Management.” (Demurrer p. 8.) Cross-Defendant also argues the cross-complaint
does “not allege facts sufficient that [Cross-Defendant] ever promised to pay
the amount due” but instead “allege that during negotiations for the sale of
[Cross-Defendant], the contracting parties purported to terminate the
management agreement between [Cross-Defendant] and WJA Management and that
[Cross-Defendant] did not pay the alleged amounts owed prior to the sale.”
(Demurrer p. 8.)
 
The elements of an account stated
cause of action are: “(1) previous transactions between the parties establishing
the relationship of debtor and creditor; (2) an agreement between the parties,
express or implied, on the amount due from the debtor to the creditor; [and]
(3) a promise by the debtor, express or implied, to pay the amount due.”
(Leighton v. Forster (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 467, 491.)
 
The cross-complaint alleges that Cross-Defendant
owes WJA Management approximately $700,000 because WJA Management provided
management services to Cross-Defendant between June 1, 2018, and May 30, 2019.
(Cross-Complaint ¶ 22.) Thus, the cross-complaint alleges Cross-Defendant and
WJA Management had previous transactions establishing the relationship of
debtor and creditor. 
 
The cross-complaint also alleges
that WJA Management “had a management contract to manage certain aspects of
[Cross-Defendant] for compensation.” (Cross-Complaint ¶ 14.) Thus, the
cross-complaint alleges an agreement between the parties, express or implied. 
 
However, the cross-complaint does
not specifically allege that the parties agreed on the amount due. Thus, the
cross-complaint does not sufficiently allege the second element of an account
stated cause of action.
 
The cross-complaint also does not
clearly allege that WJA Management promised to pay the amount due. Thus, the
cross-complaint does not sufficiently allege the third element of an account
stated cause of action.
 
Thus, Cross-Complainants have not
sufficiently alleged an account stated cause of action. This court sustains the
demurrer on this ground.
 

Reasonable
     Value for Services

 
Cross-Defendant argues the quantum
meruit cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations. (Demurrer p.
4.)
 
A two-year statute of limitations
applies to actions for quantum meruit. (See Code of Civ. Proc., § 339(a) [“An
action upon a contract, obligation or liability not founded upon an instrument
of writing, except as provided in Section 2725 of the Commercial
Code or subdivision 2 of Section 337 of this code” must be brought “[w]ithin
two years[.]”]) 
 
The cross-complaint alleges that
“[t]his is a cause of action for the reasonable value of services provided by
[WJA Management] for the period June 1, 2019 through November 8, 2019.”
(Cross-Complaint ¶ 48.) Two years after November 8, 2019, was November 8, 2021.
The cross-complaint was filed on March 12, 2024. Thus, unless the statute of
limitations was tolled, the reasonable value for services cause of action is
barred by the statute of limitations.
 

Equitable
     Tolling

 
Cross-Defendant argues equitable
tolling does not apply to cure the statute of limitations issues. (Demurrer p.
4.)
 
“Equitable tolling is a judicially
created doctrine that, where applicable, will ‘suspend or extend a statute of
limitations as necessary to ensure fundamental practicality and fairness.’” (Long
v. Forty Niners Football Co., LLC (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 550, 555.) “[T]he
doctrine applies ‘when an injured person has several legal remedies and,
reasonably and in good faith, pursues one.” (Id.) “A plaintiff seeking
the benefit of equitable tolling must show three elements: ‘timely notice, and
lack of prejudice, to the defendant, and reasonable and good faith conduct on
the part of the plaintiff.’” (Id.) “Where a claim is time-barred on its
face, the plaintiff must specifically plead facts that would support equitable
tolling.” (Id.)
 
The cross-complaint alleges that “On
January 27, 2023, Eggers individually and derivatively on behalf of [WJA
Management] commenced an action in the Second Judicial District Court of the
State of Nevada, County of Washoe against [Cross-Defendant] and Hansen among
others.” (Cross-Complaint ¶ 24.) And “Among other claims, Eggers on behalf of [WJA
Management] claimed that [Cross-Defendant] was indebted to [WJA Management] by
failing to pay [WJA Management] monies owing under its management contract and
that Hansen had breached his fiduciary duties owing to [WJA Management] and its
other shareholders and Eggers and the Trust.” (Cross-Complaint ¶ 25.) On March
3, 2023, Cross-Defendant “removed the Nevada Action to the United States
District Court for the District of Nevada[.]
(Cross-Complaint ¶ 26.) “On March 6, 2023, Eggers voluntarily dismissed
[Cross-Defendant] from the Nevada Action.” (Cross-Complaint ¶ 27.) “The Nevada
Action was later remanded back to the Second Judicial District Court of the
State of Nevada, County of Washoe and on October 10, 2023, granted Hansen’s
motion to dismiss.” (Cross-Complaint ¶ 27.) The cross-complaint alleges that
the applicable statutes of limitations were tolled by the Nevada Action.
(Cross-Complaint ¶¶ 28, 36, 40, 45, 50.) 
 
Cross-Defendant argues that the
cross-complaint does not allege that Cross-Defendant received timely notice of
their reasonable value of services claim and the cross-complaint does not
allege that “they acted reasonably and in good faith either in bringing the
first Nevada Action against [Cross-Defendant] or for their delay in bringing
this second action.” (Demurrer p. 5.) 
 
Finally, Cross-Defendant argues
that “[e]ven if equitable tolling did apply, tolling only causes ‘the running
of the statute of limitations to be temporarily suspended,’ and the limitations
period ‘will resume when that condition is lifted.” (Demurrer p. 7.)
Cross-Defendant argues that “even if the filing of the Nevada Action did toll
the statute of limitations for claims against [Cross-Defendant],
Cross-Complainants themselves admit that it only tolled such claims ‘while the
Nevada Action was pending against [Cross-Defendant.]” (Demurrer p. 7.) Cross-Defendant
argues that “the Nevada Action only tolled the limitations period for claims
against [Cross-Defendant] from January 27. 2023 (the date of filing of the
Nevada Action) to March 6, 2023 (the date of voluntary dismissal of claims
against [Cross Defendant]), a total of 38 days.” (Demurrer p. 7.) And “[a]dding
those 38 days to the original end of the limitations period of May 31, 2023
results in an extended limitations period lasting only until July 8, 2023” and
“Cross-Complainants did not refile their claims against [Cross-Defendant] until
more than eight months after the end of even the extended limitations period.”
(Demurrer p. 7.)
 
As alleged in the cross-complaint,
the Nevada Action was pending between January 27, 2023, and October 10, 2023.
(Cross-Complaint ¶¶ 24, 28.) Cross-Defendant argues that the statute of
limitations relating to Cross-Defendant was only tolled while Cross-Defendant
was a party to the Nevada Actions between January 27, 2023, and March 6, 2023.
(Demurrer p. 7.) 
 
In Collier v. City of Pasadena (1983)
142 Cal.App.3d 917, 924-925, the Court of Appeal stated that “under ordinary
circumstances that workers’ compensation claim would not equitably toll a
personal injury action against a third party who might also be liable for the
injury.” However, in Tu-Vu Drive-In Corp. v. Davies (1967) 66 Cal.2d
435, 437, the California Supreme Court stated that “The third party litigation
was instituted on November 10, 1960, and running of the statute was suspended
until termination of that litigation on December 22, 1962.” Thus, there is
authority suggesting the statute of limitations can be tolled when there is
litigation against a third-party. 
 
However, even if the statute of
limitations was tolled between January 27, 2023, and October 10, 2023, the
cross-complaint does not allege facts sufficient to suggest equitable tolling applies
in this case.
 
“The timely notice requirement
essentially means that the first claim must have been filed within the
statutory period.” (Collier v. City of Pasadena (1983) 142 Cal.App.3d at
p. 924.) Here, the cross-complaint alleges the Nevada Action was filed on
January 27, 2023. (Cross-Complaint ¶ 24.) As noted above, without tolling, the
reasonable value of services cause of action accrued on November 8, 2019, and the
statutes of limitations expired on November 8, 2021. (Cross-Complaint ¶ 48.)
Thus, based on the facts alleged in the cross-complaint, WJA Management did not
have timely notice of the reasonable value of services cause of action.
However, as to the breach of contract, account stated, and open book account
causes of action, those causes of action accrued either on May 30, 2019, or on
November 8, 2019, meaning Cross-Complainants had until – at the latest –
November 8, 2023, to timely file a complaint relating to those causes of action.
(See Cross-Complaint ¶¶ 22, 35.) Accordingly, Cross-Complainants had timely
notice of the breach of contract, open book, and account stated causes of
action.
 
“The second prerequisite
essentially translates to a requirement that the facts of the two claims be
identical or at least so similar that the defendant’s investigation of the
first claim will put him in a position to fairly defend the second.” (Collier
v. City of Pasadena, supra, 142 Cal.App.3d at p. 925.) “The critical
question is whether notice of the first claim affords the defendant an
opportunity to identify the sources of evidence which might be needed to defend
against the second claim.” (Id.) Here, the cross-complaint alleges that
in the Nevada Actions “[a]mong other claims, Eggers on behalf of [WJA
Management] claimed that [Cross-Defendant] was indebted to [WJA Management] by
failing to pay [WJA Management] monies owing under its management contract and
that Hansen breached his fiduciary duties owing to [WJA Management] and its
shareholders and Eggers and the Trust.” (Cross-Complaint ¶ 25.) Likewise, here,
the cross-complaint alleges Cross-Defendant failed to pay WJA Management monies
owed under the management contract. (See Cross-Complaint ¶¶ 35, 37, 41-42,
45-47.) 
 
“The third prerequisite of good
faith and reasonable conduct on the part of the plaintiff is less clearly
defined in the cases.” (Collier v. City of Pasadena, supra, 142
Cal.App.3d at p. 926.) In Collier, the Court of Appeal noted that in Addison
v. State of California (1978) 21 Cal.3d 313, “the Supreme Court did stress
that the Plaintiff filed his second claim a short time after tolling ended” and
“[p]erhaps, if a plaintiff delayed filing the second claim until the statute on
that claim had nearly run, even after crediting the tolled period, his conduct
might be considered unreasonable.” (Id.) Here, the
cross-complaint alleges that the Nevada Action was dismissed on October 10,
2023. (Cross-Complaint ¶ 28.) The cross-complaint in this case was filed on
March 12, 2024.  Assuming the causes of
action were tolled for the approximately ten months the Nevada Action was
pending (Cross-Complaint ¶¶ 24, 28) the cross-complaint does not allege why Cross-Complainants
waited over five months after the Nevada Action was dismissed to file the
cross-complaint in this case. Further, the cross-complaint alleges no other
facts indicating Cross-Complainants acted reasonably and in good faith. 
 
Thus, the cross-complaint does not
allege sufficient facts showing equitable tolling applies. This court sustains
the demurrer on this ground.
 
VI.          
LEAVE TO AMEND
“Where
the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer is reasonably capable of
cure, ‘leave to amend is routinely and liberally granted to give the plaintiff
a chance to cure the defect in question.’” (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City
of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)¿ 
This
court finds that there is a reasonable possibility Cross-Complainants can cure the
defects by amending the cross-complaint.
VII.        
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, this court sustains the
demurrer and grants Cross-Complainants leave to amend the cross-complaint.
