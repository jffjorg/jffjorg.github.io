  CASE NO.: 21STCV25648
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO BE RELIEVED
  AS COUNSEL
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
August 1, 2024



 
Jasmine
J. Badawi, counsel of record for Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Patricia J. Espinoza
Rosales, seeks to be relieved as counsel. 
Counsel’s declaration states that there has been a breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship.  No party opposed
the motion.
Absent
a showing of resulting prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be
granted.  (People v. Prince (1968)
268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.)  Counsel’s motion
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  Trial is not until January 21, 2025, and there
is no prejudice to Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant.
The
unopposed motion to be relieved is GRANTED and effective upon filing a proof of
service showing service of the signed Form MC-053 order and this order on Patricia
J. Espinoza Rosales and all parties who have appeared.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
 
        
Dated this 1st day of August 2024
