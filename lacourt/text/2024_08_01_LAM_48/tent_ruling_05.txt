  CASE NO.: 24STCV12383
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR LEAVE
  TO AMEND COMPLAINT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
August 1, 2024



 
On May 15, 2024, Plaintiff Tae Young Lee filed this action.  Defendants have answered and filed a cross-complaint.  On July 9 and 10, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion
for leave to file a first amended complaint (“FAC”).
The
Court may, in its discretion and after notice to the adverse party, allow an amendment
to any pleading.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 473,
subd. (a)(1).)  A motion to amend a pleading
must include a copy of the proposed amendment or amended pleading which must be
serially numbered to differentiate it from previous pleadings or amendments and
must state what allegations in the previous pleading are proposed to be deleted
or added, if any, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number, the allegations
are located.  (California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1324(a).)  The motion shall also be
accompanied by a declaration attesting to the effect of the amendment, why the amendment
is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were
discovered, and why the request for amendment was not made earlier.  (California Rules of Court, rule 3.1324(b).)  The Court does not ordinarily consider the validity
of the proposed amended pleading when determining whether to grant leave to amend.  (Kittredge Sports Co. v. Superior Court
(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 1045, 1048.)
Plaintiff
identifies the amendments and provides a copy of the proposed FAC.  Plaintiff seeks t add a seventh cause of action
for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  Counsel learned new facts and evidence during
a June 29, 2024 detailed interview with Plaintiff.  (Yang Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.)  These facts are within Defendants’ knowledge and
will not change the nature of the case.  (Yang
Decl. ¶ 4.)  Trial has not yet been set.  No oppositions were filed.
Because
there is no showing of prejudice, the motion for leave to amend the complaint is
GRANTED.  The Proposed FAC, submitted separately
on July 10, 2024, is deemed filed as of August 1, 2024.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
