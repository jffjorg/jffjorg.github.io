  CASE NO.: 21STCV40374
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING CROSS-DEFENDANT’S
  MOTION TO SET ASIDE/VACATE DEFAULT
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
August 1, 2024



 
On November 2, 2021, Plaintiffs Seviinth Wave Inc., Dott
Nguyen, Graham Bradstreet, and Marjorie DeHey filed this action against Defendant
Teri VanLandingham.  On December 10, 2021,
VanLandingham filed a cross-complaint.
On March 7, 2022, the Court granted in
part a motion to strike the cross-complaint. 
The Court did not strike the cross-complaint, but it stayed the cross-complaint
in this case pending the arbitration in Case No. 20STCP01281.
On June 1, 2022, the Court granted a motion
to compel Seviinth Wave’s claims to arbitration and stayed the entire action pending
arbitration.
On June 22, 2023, the Court granted a
motion to relieve Seviinth Wave’s and Bradstreet’s counsel.
On February 2, 2024, the Court lifted
the stay.
On June 4, 2024, the Court entered default
against Bradstreet.
On June 18, 2024, Bradstreet filed a motion
to set aside the default.
The Court may
relieve a party or counsel from a judgment resulting from mistake, inadvertence,
surprise, or excusable neglect.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 473, subd. (b).)  The application
for relief must be made within a reasonable time, not to exceed six months, after
the judgment.  (Ibid.)  “Section 473 is often applied liberally where
the party in default moves promptly to seek relief, and the party opposing the motion
will not suffer prejudice if relief is granted. 
[Citations.]  In such situations ‘very
slight evidence will be required to justify a court in setting aside the default.’  [Citation.]” 
(Elston v. City of Turlock (1985) 38 Cal.3d 227, 233.)
Bradstreet timely filed this motion only
two weeks after entry of default.  He explains
that he is now unrepresented by counsel and was unaware that he needed to file an
answer to the cross-complaint after the stay was lifted.  (Bradstreet Decl. ¶ 5.)
VanLandingham’s counsel notes that on
May 13, 2024, she filed a declaration requesting that all Cross-Defendants file
an answer to the cross-complaint.  (Cowan
Decl. ¶ 6.)  This declaration was titled “Declaration
of Counsel as to Proof of Service of Cross-Complaint and Exhibits Thereto.”  At the end, counsel declared, “As of May 13, 2024,
no party has filed an Answer to the Cross-Complaint which was served on December
10, 2021.  Ms. VanLandingham respectfully
requests all parties to file an Answer to the Cross-Complaint.”
Only twenty-two days after the declaration,
VanLandingham filed a request for entry of default.  (Cowan Decl. ¶ 7.)  VanLandingham’s
counsel had an ethical obligation to warn Bradstreet counsel that she was about
to seek default.  (See Lasalle v. Vogel
(2019) 36 Cal.App.5th 127, 135 (Lasalle).)    The May 13, 2024 declaration did not
warn any Cross-Defendant that VanLandingham was about to seek entries of default.  Furthermore, it was evident that Bradstreet was
participating in the case and was able to be contacted.  Bradstreet was present at the February 2, 2024
and May 2, 2024 Case Management Conferences, and he filed a Case Management Statement
on March 26, 2024.  
VanLandingham has not shown any prejudice
if the default is set aside, “given the relatively short time between [VanLandingham]
seeking the default and [Bradstreet] asking to be relieved from it.”  (Lasalle, supra, 36 Cal.App.5th at pp.
138-139.)  “‘When evaluating a motion to set
aside a default judgment on equitable grounds, the “court must weigh the reasonableness
of the conduct of the moving party in light of the extent of the prejudice to the
responding party.”’ [Citation.]”  (Id.
at p. 139.)  As in Lasalle, setting
aside this default involves little wasted time.
Accordingly, the motion to set aside the
June 4, 2024 entry of default is GRANTED. 
Bradstreet is ordered to file an answer within 10 days.

Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
