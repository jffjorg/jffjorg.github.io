And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants the petition to compel arbitration filed by Damco Distribution Services, Inc. and Simplified Labor Staffing Solutions Inc. on behalf of themselves and the other defendant, Tito Harper. The petition was filed on October 20, 2023, and alleges that the parties had entered into an arbitration agreement on June 8, 2021. The agreement requires arbitration of all disputes relating to or arising out of or in connection with employment. The Judge finds that the arbitration agreement satisfies the requirements of Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, including the requirement of neutral arbitrators, adequate discovery, and a written award. The Judge also finds that the arbitration agreement is enforceable and that the plaintiff has not shown any grounds to revoke the agreement. Therefore, the Court grants the petition to compel arbitration and stays the action pending the conclusion of the arbitration.
