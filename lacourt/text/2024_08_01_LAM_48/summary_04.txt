And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration, ruling that the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable. The judge found that the plaintiff, Nicolle DeSanto, had initiated arbitration on June 30, 2023, and that the defendants had satisfied their burden of showing the existence of an agreement to arbitrate. The judge also found that the arbitration agreement was not invalid under the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 (EFAA), as the plaintiff had not plausibly alleged sexual harassment claims.

The judge also ruled that the Mandatory Fee Arbitration Act (MFAA) did not prohibit arbitration in this case, as the parties had agreed in writing to arbitrate under the Business and Professions Code's mandatory arbitration rules. The judge further found that the doctrine of equitable estoppel applied, allowing the non-signatory defendant, Steven A. Simons, to enforce the arbitration agreement.

The judge stayed the interpleader action and scheduled a status conference for August 1, 2025.
