Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to strike certain paragraphs of the plaintiff's Fourth Amended Complaint (4AC). The defendant argued that the allegations assert a time-barred claim for breach of contract based on alleged ADA violations. However, the court found that the defendant failed to show that the four-year statute of limitations for breach of contract would render the allegations irrelevant, false, or improper. The court also found that the defendant's arguments were speculative and lacked evidence to support their claims. Additionally, the court noted that the plaintiff's interpretation of the lease agreement was reasonable and that the defendant's contention that the damages alleged in the complaint were moot was unfounded.
