And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled against the defendant's motion to continue the trial, which is currently set for June 10, 2024. The defendant, Adam Neuwirth, seeks to continue the trial to allow for new counsel to get up to speed and complete discovery. The defendant argues that the current procedural posture and trial date prevent the conclusion of discovery, and that his defense will be severely handicapped and prejudiced if the trial proceeds as scheduled. However, the judge finds that the defendant's delay in arranging for an independent medical examination (IME) and substituting counsel into the case over five months ago do not establish good cause for a continuance. The judge also notes that trial dates are firm, and that the defendant's self-created scheduling issues do not justify a continuance.
