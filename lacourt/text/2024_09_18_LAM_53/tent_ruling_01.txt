  Order RE:
 
petition to confirm arbitration award
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Petitioner Jeffer Mangels
Butler & Mitchell LLP      
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this Petition. 
DISCUSSION
Petitioner Jeffer Mangels Butler & Mitchell LLP (“Petitioner”) filed
the pending Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award and Enter Judgment against
respondents Gary Pagar (“Pagar”) and Runyon NKMS, LLC (“Runyon”) (collectively,
“Respondents”) on July 24, 2024.
“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made may
petition the court to¿confirm, correct or vacate the award.¿ The petition shall
name as respondents all parties to the arbitration and may name as respondents
any other persons bound by the arbitration award.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.)¿
“A petition under this chapter shall: [¶] (a) Set forth the substance of or
have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies
the existence of such an agreement.¿ [¶] 
(b) Set forth the names of the arbitrators.¿ [¶]  (c) Set forth or have attached a copy of the
award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
1285.4.)  “If a petition or response
under this chapter is duly served and filed, the court shall confirm the award
as made . . . unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and
confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.”¿
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.)¿ Any response to the petition is required to be
filed and served within 10 days after service of the petition.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.6.)¿¿ 
The court finds that Petitioner did not properly serve Respondents
with notice of the hearing on its Petition.
First, the court finds that Petitioner did not properly give notice of
the time of this hearing to respondent Pagar. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4.)  The
court acknowledges that, on August 13, 2024, Petitioner filed a proof of
service of establishing that it served respondent Pagar with the Petition, the
Notice of Hearing on Petition to Confirm the Arbitration Award and Enter
Judgment, and other case management documents by substituted service on August
10, 2024.  (Aug. 13, 2024 Proof of
Service, ¶¶ 2, 3, 5, and pp. 3 [proof of service by mail], 4 [affidavit of due
diligence]; Code Civ. Proc., § 415.20, subd. (b).)  However, the notice of hearing stated two
different times for the hearing on the Petition: (1) in its caption, Petitioner
stated the correct hearing time to be 10:00 a.m., but (2) in the paragraph
giving notice, Petitioner stated the incorrect hearing time to be 8:30
a.m.  (Aug. 7, 2024 Notice of Hearing,
pp. 1:14-15, 2:1-4.)  Thus, it appears
that respondent Pagar may not have received proper notice of the hearing time
on this Petition. 
Second, the court finds that Petitioner did not give sufficient notice
of the hearing on its Petition to respondent NKMS.  On September 5, 2024, Petitioner filed a
proof of service of establishing that it served respondent NKMS with the
Petition, the Notice of Hearing on Petition to Confirm the Arbitration Award
and Enter Judgment, and other case management documents by substituted service
on September 4, 2024.  (Sep. 5, 2024
Proof of Service, ¶¶ 1, 3, 5, and p. 3 [proof of service by mail on September
5, 2024].)  Service was deemed complete
on respondent NKMS on September 15, 2024, i.e., 10 days after the date that
Petitioner mailed the Petition and related documents.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 415.20, subd. (b)
[“Service of summons in this manner is deemed complete on the 10th day after
mailing”].)  However, “all moving and
supporting papers shall be served and filed at least 16 court days before the
hearing.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005,
subd. (b).)  Because service was deemed
complete on September 15, 2024, Petitioner served respondent NKMS with only two
court days’ notice of the September 18, 2024 hearing on the Petition.[1]  
Thus, the court finds that it is appropriate, and therefore exercises
its discretion, to continue the hearing on Petitioner’s Petition to Confirm
Arbitration Award and Enter Judgment to ensure that Respondents are given
sufficient notice of the correct hearing date and time on the Petition.
ORDER
            The court orders that the hearing on
petitioner Jeffer Mangels Butler & Mitchell LLP’s Petition to Confirm
Arbitration Award and Enter Judgment is continued to December 2, 2024, at 10:00
a.m., in Department 53.
            The court orders petitioner Jeffer
Mangels Butler & Mitchell LLP (1) to give notice of this ruling to
respondents Gary Pagar and Runyon NKMS, LLC, and (2) to file with the court the
notice of ruling and a proof of service of the notice of ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  September 18, 2024
