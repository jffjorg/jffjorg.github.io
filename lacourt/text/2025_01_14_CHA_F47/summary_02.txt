And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel compliance and impose sanctions against American Honda Motor Co., Inc. and its former counsel, Clark Hill LLP. The motion was filed by Plaintiff Olivia Morena Posada, who is seeking an order compelling the defendant to produce documents consistent with its responses to requests for production of documents. The plaintiff is also seeking sanctions in the amount of $2,130.00.

The judge finds that the request to compel compliance is moot because the defendant has served an amended further response to Request 45, which states that no documents resulted from the search and no responsive documents have ever existed. However, the judge finds that the plaintiff was forced to incur fees and costs related to the filing of this motion due to the defendant's failure to produce responsive documents and failure to respond to the plaintiff's meet and confer letter.

The judge grants the request for sanctions against the defendant and its former counsel, but reduces the amount to $1,185.00. The sanctions are payable within 30 days.
