The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 21SMCV00002, a motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Bruce D.

The Judge found that the motion complied with the Rules of Professional Conduct, sections 1.16(b)(4) and (b)(5), indicating an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship and breach of the attorney-client agreement. However, the Judge noted that the proofs of service did not indicate that Defendant Skylark Capital Management, LLC was served as required by the Rules of Court. As a result, the Judge denied the motion to be relieved as counsel without prejudice, ordering Counsel to provide notice of the Court's ruling and file a proof of service regarding the same.
