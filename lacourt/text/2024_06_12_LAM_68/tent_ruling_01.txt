SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
purchased a new 2023 Mercedes-Benz vehicle on July 21, 2023. The vehicle
suffers from defects, including the active brake light, camera view, and
instrument cluster systems.
 
On
January 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint for 1) Violation of Civil Code §
1793.2(d); 2) Violation of Civil Code § 1793.2(b); 3) Violation Of Civil Code §
1793.2(a)(3); 4) Breach of Express Written Warranty; and 5) Breach of the

RULING: Denied.
Request
for Judicial Notice: Granted.
The
court takes judicial notice of the existence of the complaint, but cannot take
judicial notice of the content for any truth of the matter asserted.
 
Defendant
Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (Mercedes-Benz) moves to compel arbitration pursuant to
the terms of the lease executed at the time of the acquisition of the vehicle. Mercedes-Benz
seeks arbitration on grounds that the claims arise from alleged defects with
the vehicle. Mercedes-Benz in its role as manufacturer, concedes it was not a
signatory party to the agreement, but insists it can enforce the agreement as
the party responsible for the warranty provisions under both the terms of the
contract as a third party beneficiary and equitable estoppel. The court
electronic filing system shows no opposition or reply on file at the time of
the tentative ruling publication cutoff. 
 
“A written agreement to submit to arbitration an existing
controversy or a controversy thereafter arising is valid, enforceable and
irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any
contract.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.) “On petition of a party to an arbitration
agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a
controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy, the
court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy
if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists, unless
it determines that: (a) The right to compel arbitration has been waived by the
petitioner; or (b) Grounds exist for the revocation of the agreement.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1281.2.)
 
Mercedes-Benz moves to compel under the Federal
Arbitration Act (FAA), as provided in the contract. While the FAA governs the
rules for conducting arbitration, barring citation to a case precluding
California law, motions to compel arbitration are still governed by California
law. (Adolph v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (2023) 14 Cal.5th 1104, 1119; Viking River Cruises, Inc. v.
Moriana (2022) 142 S.Ct. 1906; Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland
Stanford Junior University (1989) 489 U.S. 468, 477–479; Victrola 89, LLC v. Jaman
Properties 8 LLC (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 337, 346; see AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion (2011) 563 U.S. 333, 341-346.)
 
The law creates a general presumption in favor of
arbitration. In a motion to
compel arbitration, the moving party must prove by a preponderance of evidence
the existence of the arbitration agreement and that the dispute is covered by
the agreement. The burden then shifts to the resisting party to prove by a
preponderance of evidence a ground for denial (e.g., fraud, unconscionability,
etc.). (Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin'l Securities Corp. (1996) 14
Cal.4th 394, 413-414; Hotels Nevada v. L.A. Pacific Ctr., Inc. (2006)
144 Cal.App.4th 754, 758.)
Any challenges to the formation of the
arbitration agreement should be considered before any order sending the parties
to arbitration. The trier of fact weighs all
evidence, including affidavits, declarations, documents, and, if applicable,
oral testimony to determine whether the action goes to arbitration. (Hotels Nevada v. L.A. Pacific Ctr.,
Inc., supra, 144 Cal.App.4th at p. 758.)
 
The court finds
the declaration of counsel for defendant sufficiently establishes competence in
knowledge, and the rightful possession of the lease agreement containing the
subject arbitration clause applicable to the subject action. [Declaration
of Ali Ameripour, Ex. 2.] The
court finds the language of the agreement also clearly applies to the
warranties on the vehicle.
 
While the motion remains unopposed, the court considers the situation
regarding the lack of Mercedes-Benz as a signatory party to the agreement,
thereby barring enforcement of the contract. The lease itself provides for the
terms, and includes the referenced arbitration clause. The agreement was only
between Plaintiff and non-party Keyes European. Mercedes-Benz is not a named
party within the agreement. [Ameripour Decl., Ex. 2.]
 
Arbitration agreements may only be generally compelled by
parties to the agreement. The doctrine of equitable estoppel allows for a
non-signatory party to compel arbitration “‘when the causes of action against the nonsignatory are “intimately
founded in and intertwined” with the underlying contract obligations.’” (JSM Tuscany, LLC v. Superior
Court (2011)
193 Cal.App.4th 1222, 1237; Felisilda v. FCA US LLC (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 486,
495-496 (Felisilda); Goldman v.
KPMG, LLP (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 209, 217-218; Crowley Maritime Corp. v. Boston Old Colony Ins. Co. (2008)
158 Cal.App.4th 1061, 1070 [Under equitable estoppel, a party cannot avoid
participation in arbitration, where the party received
“a direct benefit under the contract containing an arbitration
clause…”]; Boucher v. Alliance Title Co, Inc. (2005)
127 Cal.App.4th 262, 271).)
 
A leading case decided in the
Second Appellate District distinguishes the contractual basis of warranty
claims. (Ford Motor Warranty Cases
(Ochoa) (2023) 89 Cal.App.5th 1324.) The Ford Motor Warranty Cases specifically
confronted the exact situation regarding a third party non-signatory
manufacturer seeking to compel arbitration(s) via (a) sales contract(s) of the
various purchasing parties for 2015-2016 manufacturing dated vehicles. The
court categorically distinguished Felisilda
whereby non-signatory manufacturers could compel arbitration on grounds of
equitable estoppel. The holding, at least in part, relies on a finding that the
warranty obligations, and therefore claims against the manufacturer arise
independently from the sales
contract. (Id. at p. 1324, 133-1334.)
 
The court also found that Ford
Motor Company was precluded from making an argument as a third party
beneficiary, due to the failure to establish any showing within the express
terms of the contract. (Id. at
pp. 1334-1335) Another recent case in the Second
Appellate District on the subject affirms the holding of the Ford Warranty case
on both equitable estoppel and third party beneficiary theories. (Montemayor v. Ford Motor Co.
(2023) 92 Cal.App.5th 958, 971-974.) The Third Appellate District recently
granted a writ of mandate reversing an order compelling arbitration citing the
Second District opinions in support. (Kielar
v. Superior Court (2023) 94 Cal.App.5th
614, 619-621.) 
 
To the extent Mercedes-Benz may depend
on a finding of privity of contract among the parties and therefore a basis of
standing for enforcement of the warranties, the court also finds no basis of
enforcement. As addressed in the plain language of the Song-Beverly Act
statute, along with other California law, purchasers gain vested warranties
with the purchase of new and certain used automobiles. The Ford Motor
Warranty Cases specifically found the arbitration clause within the finance
contracts constitutes a separate and independent consideration from said
legally vested warranties imposed outside the purchase contract context. (Ford Motor Warranty Cases, supra,
89 Cal.App.5th at pp. 1334-1335.) The Ford Motor Warranty Cases court
specifically decoupled inherently owed warranties from contractual principles
governing arbitration. In separating the governing spheres, the court
specifically found warranties shall not be governed by sales contracts. (Id.
at pp. 1335-1336.) The court also specifically held that said contracts lack evidence in support of any independent argument for a
third party beneficiary relationship. (Id. at pp. 1336-1337.) 
 
The California Supreme Court
granted review of the Ford Motor Warranty Cases, Montemayor,
and Kielar. “Grant of review by the Supreme Court of a decision
by the Court of Appeal does not affect the appellate court's certification of
the opinion for full or partial publication under rule 8.1105(b) or rule
8.1110, but any such Court of Appeal opinion, whether officially published in
hard copy or electronically, must be accompanied by a prominent notation
advising that review by the Supreme Court has been granted. [¶] (2) The Supreme
Court may order that an opinion certified for publication is not to be published
or that an opinion not certified is to be published. The Supreme Court may also
order depublication of part of an opinion at any time after granting review.” (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 8.1105(e)(1)(B), (e)(2).) “Pending
review and filing of the Supreme Court's opinion, unless otherwise
ordered by the Supreme Court
under (3), a published
opinion of a Court
of Appeal in the matter has no binding or precedential effect, and may be cited
for potentially persuasive value only. Any citation to the Court of Appeal
opinion must also note the grant of review and any subsequent action by the
Supreme Court.”
(Cal. Rules of Court, 8.1115(e)(1).) 
 
Notwithstanding the California
Supreme Court review, the court still considers the cases persuasive impacts. “As a practical matter, a superior court ordinarily
will follow an appellate opinion emanating from its own district even though it
is not bound to do so. Superior courts in other appellate districts may pick
and choose between conflicting lines of authority.” (McCallum v. McCallum (1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 308, 315
(footnote 4).) 
 
The court finds the reasoning of Ford
Motor Warranty Cases, regarding the legal separation of warranty
obligations from sales contract arbitration contract principles sufficiently
dissociates any findings of an inextricably intertwined contractual
relationship on grounds of estoppel between Plaintiff and Mercedes-Benz. The
motion otherwise lacks sufficient argument or evidence establishing a third
party beneficiary relationship, or authority of the Keyes European
representative from executing the agreement on behalf of Mercedes-Benz. The
court finds no distinction in the instant lease agreement from the agreement(s)
considered in the Ford case. Thus, for both court policy reasons, and
factual agreement with the Ford Motor Warranty Cases, Montemayor,
and Kielar, the court continues to adhere to the subject authority
pending California Supreme Court review.
 
The motion is therefore denied.
