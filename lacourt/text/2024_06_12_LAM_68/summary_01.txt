And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion to compel arbitration. The defendant, Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, seeks to compel arbitration based on the lease agreement between the plaintiff, Sang Hyun Kim, and Keyes European. The plaintiff purchased a new 2023 Mercedes-Benz vehicle and alleges defects in the vehicle. The court finds that the lease agreement does not create a contractual relationship between the plaintiff and Mercedes-Benz, and therefore, Mercedes-Benz does not have standing to enforce the warranties. The court also finds that the arbitration clause in the lease agreement is not enforceable. The court cites several cases, including Ford Motor Warranty Cases, Montemayor, and Kielar, which support its decision. The court concludes that the plaintiff's claims are not subject to arbitration and that the motion to compel arbitration is denied.
