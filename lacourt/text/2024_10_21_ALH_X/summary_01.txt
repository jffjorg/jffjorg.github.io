And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Court has considered the motion for judgment filed by Defendants Jin, et al. based on several grounds. The Court finds that judgment should be granted to Defendant Hoa Jin because the allegations in the verified complaint do not establish a cause of action against her. Additionally, the Court grants judgment to Defendant BY Jin, LLC because there is insufficient evidence to support that the oral agreement was entered into by the company through an authorized agent. The Court also grants judgment to Defendant Bella Development and Rain LLC because there is insufficient evidence to support that the oral agreement was entered into by the companies through their authorized agent.

The Court denies judgment to Defendant Jin on the fourth basis for judgment because the alleged oral agreement does not violate the statute of frauds. The Court also denies judgment to Defendant Jin on the fifth basis for judgment because the breach alleged in the complaint did not occur (as opposed to a related, but different breach which was not specifically pled but which was presented as evidence at trial).

The Court's ruling is based on the following legal principles: the trial court has broad discretion to grant or deny an amendment to a complaint at trial, and the decision to allow an amendment to the pleadings in the midst of trial rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. A contract is a voluntary and lawful agreement, by competent parties, for a good consideration, to do or not to do a specified thing.
