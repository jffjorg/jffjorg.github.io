English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is in response to a motion to compel the deposition of Judith Andrades, the daughter of the plaintiff, Fredy Wembe. The motion was filed by Target Corporation and Manuel Quijada, the defendants, who argue that Judith Andrades failed to cooperate during a previous deposition and has not produced documents in an admissible form. The court finds that the defendants are entitled to take the deposition of Judith Andrades and orders the deposition to occur on April 10, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. The court also notes that Judith Andrades' opposition to the motion was not served on the defendants and does not provide good cause to deny the motion. The court finds that Judith Andrades has been engaged in gamesmanship to avoid participating in the deposition and orders her to comply with the rules of the deposition. Failure to comply may result in sanctions.
