 Case Number:  23STCV19700    Hearing Date:   March 20, 2024    Dept:  39 Beach District
Surgery Center v. Recreational Equipment, Inc.
Case No.
23STCV19700
Demurrer
 
            Plaintiff
Beach District Surgery Center (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against
Recreational Equipment, Inc. (“Defendant”) asserting causes of action for
negligent misrepresentation and promissory estoppel.  Plaintiff provided medical care to patients
who were insured under policies issued by Defendant.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant underpaid
for this medical care.  Defendant now
demurs to the first amended complaint.  
 
“It is black letter law that a
demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint.”
 (Lewis v. Safeway, Inc. (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 385, 388.)  In
ruling on a demurrer, the court must “liberally construe[]” the allegations of
the complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 452.) 
“This rule of liberal construction means that the reviewing court draws
inferences favorable to the plaintiff, not the defendant.”  (Perez v.
Golden Empire Transit Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1238.)
 
As an initial matter, Defendant
argues that this action is preempted by section 514, subdivision (a) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, commonly known as
“ERISA.”  Defendant is incorrect.  ERISA does not preempt claims by health care
providers for payment.  (See Blue
Cross of California v. Anesthesia Care Associates Medical Group, Inc., 187
F.3d 1045, 1054 (9th Cir. 1999).) 
Defendant does not address this case in its reply brief.    
 
Plaintiff’s first cause of action
is for negligent misrepresentation.  The
elements of negligent misrepresentation are: (1) The misrepresentation of a past
or existing material fact, (2) Without reasonable ground for believing it to be
true, (3) With intent to induce another’s reliance on the misrepresented fact,
(4) Justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation, and (5) Damages as a result
of the misrepresentation.  (See National
Union Fire Company of Pittsburg, PA v. Cambridge Integrated Services Group, Inc.
(2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 35, 50.)  Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant misrepresented that it would reimburse Plaintiff for
medical services at a higher rate based upon “an average payment for a
procedure provided by similarly situated medical providers within similarly
situated areas or places of practice.” 
(First Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 15, 66.) 
Instead, Defendant reimbursed Plaintiff at the lower Medicare rate.  (See id., ¶¶ 67-68.)  
 
Defendant’s counsel argues that
there was no misrepresentation of a past or existing fact because Defendant
allegedly promised to reimburse Plaintiff in the future.  A plaintiff may maintain such an action if
the plaintiff alleges “that the promisor did not intend to perform at the time
he or she made the promise and that it was intended to deceive or induce the
promise to do nor not do a particular thing.” 
(Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153,
159.)  In the instant case, Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant knew at the time of the promise that it would pay only
at the Medicare rate and intended to deceive Plaintiff.  (See id., ¶¶ 67, 69.)  These allegations are sufficient.  
 
Defendant’s counsel argues that
there were no misrepresentations because the higher rate applied to in-network
providers.  This is a factual issue that
must be resolved on summary judgment. 
The Court has considered Defendant’s remaining arguments and finds none
to be persuasive.  Therefore, the
demurrer to the first cause of action is overruled.
 
Plaintiff’s second cause of action
is for promissory estoppel.  To state a
claim for promissory estoppel, Plaintiff must allege that Defendant made a
promise, which Defendant should reasonably have expected to induce Plaintiff’s
substantial reliance, and that Plaintiff’s reliance caused injustice that can
only be avoided by enforcement of Defendant’s promise.  (C & K Eng'g Contractors v. Amber
Steel Co. (1978) 23 Cal. 3d 1, 6.) 
As set forth above, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant promised to
reimburse Plaintiff at a higher rate, which induced Plaintiff to provide
medical services.  Plaintiff alleges that
Defendant then reimbursed Plaintiff at the much lower Medicare rate.  (First Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 74-79.)  For pleading purposes, these allegations
suffice.  
 
Defendant’s counsel argues that
statement of “reimbursement methods” and “rate of payment” is not a “clear and
unambiguous promise to pay in accordance with plaintiff’s expectation of
payments,” citing Aton Center, Inc. v. United Healthcare Ins. Co. (2023)
93 Cal.App.5th 1214.  Defendant’s counsel
also argues that “[i]t is well settled that a verification of health benefits
does not create an implied promise to pay,” citing Summit Est., Inc. v. Cigna
Healthcare of California, Inc., No. 17-CV-03871-LHK, 2017 WL 4517111, at *6
(N.D. Cal. Oct. 10, 2017.)  The Court
cannot resolve such issues on demurrer. 
Whether Defendant made a clear and unambiguous promise or merely
verified health benefits and disclose reimbursement rates is an evidentiary
issue which must wait until summary judgment.

1.         The
Court overruled Defendant’s demurrer.

shall file an answer within thirty (30) days.

14, 2025, at 9:00 a.m.
 
4.         The

5.         Jury
fees shall be posted within ten (10) days or the parties shall waive jury.
 
6.         Defendant’s
