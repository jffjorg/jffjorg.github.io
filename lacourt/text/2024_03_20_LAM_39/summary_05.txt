And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the defendant, Recreational Equipment, Inc. (REI). REI had demurred to the first amended complaint filed by the plaintiff, Beach District Surgery Center (BDS), alleging causes of action for negligent misrepresentation and promissory estoppel. The plaintiff alleged that REI had misrepresented the reimbursement rate for medical services provided to patients and had underpaid for those services.

The judge found that REI's demurrer was incorrect and overruled it. The judge held that ERISA did not preempt the claims against REI and that the plaintiff's allegations of negligent misrepresentation and promissory estoppel were sufficient to state a claim.

Regarding the negligent misrepresentation claim, the judge held that REI's alleged misrepresentation of the reimbursement rate was a past or existing material fact, and that the plaintiff had justifiably relied on that misrepresentation to its detriment.

Regarding the promissory estoppel claim, the judge held that the plaintiff had alleged a clear and unambiguous promise by REI to reimburse at a higher rate, which induced the plaintiff to provide medical services. The judge found that this was sufficient to state a claim and that the issue of whether the promise was clear and unambiguous would be resolved at summary judgment.

The judge ordered that REI file an answer to the complaint within 30 days and set the following dates: Final Status Conference on October 3, 2025, and Trial on October 14, 2025.
