And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering two motions: one filed by the plaintiff to compel the defendant to produce certain documents demanded in the deposition notice, and another filed by the defendant to compel further responses to requests for production of documents and special interrogatories. The plaintiff filed a motion to compel production of documents, but after the motion was filed, the defendant produced the requested documents except for surveillance videos. The court denied the motion as moot except with respect to the surveillance videos, which the defendant was ordered to produce in its native format or obtain quotes for transfer. The defendant filed motions to compel further responses, but neither party met-and-conferred in good faith before filing the motions. The court has no tentative order on these motions and requests that the parties be prepared to discuss this issue at the hearing.
