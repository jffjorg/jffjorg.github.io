Background
On
August 21, 2024, Petitioner Turnpike Films, Inc. (“Petitioner”) filed its
Verified Petition for Order Reinstating Active Corporate Status Pursuant to
Government Code Section 12261(c) (the “Petition”). 
On
September 5, 2024, Honorable Curtis A Kin of Department 86 at the Stanley Mosk
Courthouse reviewed the Petition and referred the case to Department 1 for
reassignment to a Direct Calendar Court pursuant to Local Rule 2.8, as a
petition pursuant to Government Code Section 12261(c) is not a special
proceeding identified as being assigned to a Writs and Receivers Department.
(Minute Order 09/05/24.) 
On
September 9, 2024, Department 1 reassigned the case to Department 45 at the
Stanley Mosk Courthouse. (Minute Order 09/09/24.) 
On
September 30, 2024, Petitioner filed the instant Motion for Order Reinstating
Active Corporate Status Pursuant to Government Code Section 12261(c), which is
set for hearing on October 23, 2024 in Department 45 (the “Motion”). Petitioner
concurrently filed the Declaration of Amy Benedetti and its Proposed Order. There are no other parties in this
matter, and there have been no attempts to intervene, oppose, or otherwise
respond.
Legal Standard 
 
California Government Code section 12261
provides:  
 
(a)   The Secretary of State shall reinstate to
active status on its records, a business entity for which a court finds any of
the following: 
(1)    The factual representations by a shareholder,
member, partner, or other person that are contained in the termination document
are materially false. 
(2)  
The
submission of the termination document to the Secretary of State for filing is
fraudulent. 
 
(b)    If
a court of competent jurisdiction orders reinstatement of a business entity to
active status on any of the grounds stated in paragraph (1) or (2) of
subdivision (a), the order for reinstatement shall state all of the following: 
(1)   The specific grounds for reinstatement. 
(2)   That if there is a conflict with the
entity name under subdivision (b) of Section 201, subdivision (b) of Section
5122, subdivision (c) of Section 7122, subdivision (b) of Section 9122,
subdivision (b) of Section 12302, subdivision (d) of Section 15901.08,
subdivision (b) of Section 17701.08 of the Corporations Code, or related
statutes, the reinstatement shall be conditioned upon the business entity
concurrently submitting for filing an amendment to change its name to eliminate
the conflict along with the certified copy of the order required by Section
12263. 
(3)   That the business entity shall be
reinstated effective from the date of the filing of the court order with the
Secretary of State. 
(c)    The court order for reinstatement may be
obtained by submitting a petition to the superior court containing the legal
and factual basis for reinstatement or as part of a civil action for damages or
equitable relief. The Secretary of State shall not be made a party to the
proceeding.
Discussion 
            Petitioner seeks an order reinstating active corporate
status pursuant to Government Code Section 12261. Petitioner filed its Petition
and Motion on August 21, 2024 and September 30, 2024, respectively. 
            The Petition provides as follows. Petitioner is an
s-corporation incorporated in the State of California with its principal place
of business located as 17252 Hawthorne Boulevard, #487, Torrance, California
90504. (Verified Pet. at ¶ 1.) On April 17, 2024, a Statement of Information
was filed for Petitioner without Petitioner’s knowledge, authorization, or
consent, updating Petitioner’s principal address and mailing address to AEC
Financial, 303 East Foothill Boulevard, Monrovia, California 91016. (Verified
Pet. at ¶ 4; Benedetti Decl. ¶ 7.) In addition, the unauthorized 2024 Statement
of Information changed Petitioner’s agent for service of process from Gregg
Lindsay Reneau to Amy Benedetti. (Verified Pet. at ¶ 5.) Petitioner has no
relationship with AEC Financial or Amy Benedetti and has never engaged with
either (Verified Pet. at ¶ 6.) Neither AEC Financial nor Amy Benedetti is
authorized to act on behalf of the Petitioner. (Verified Pet. at ¶ 13;
Benedetti Decl. at ¶ 12.) On May 31, 2024, an unauthorized Certificate of
Dissolution – California Corporation Termination (the “Dissolution Document”)
was prepared and filed for Petitioner by someone named Beth Hubbard. (Verified
Pet. at ¶ 7; Benedetti Decl. at ¶ 10.). Beth Hubbard is not authorized to act
on Petitioner’s behalf. (Verified Pet. at ¶ 8.) Petitioner has no relationship
with and has never engaged with Beth Hubbard. (Ibid.) The Dissolution
Document contained materially false representations including that the
dissolution was “made by a vote of ALL of the shareholders of the California
corporation” is materially false; “all known debts and liabilities of
Petitioner have not been actually paid or paid as far as its assets permitted”;
“the known assets of Petitioner have not been distributed to the persons
entitled thereto or the corporation acquired no known assets.” (Verified Pet.
at ¶ 14.)
            Petitioner argues that it is entitled to an order finding
that reinstatement is warranted as the Dissolution Document was filed without
Petitioner’s permission or through its authority. (Motion pp. 4-5.) AEC
Financial, Amy Benedetti, and Beth Hubbard have never been associated with
Petitioner nor authorized to act on its behalf in any capacity whatsoever. (Verified
Pet. at ¶¶ 8, 13; Benedetti Decl. at ¶ 12.) 
            In light of the foregoing and lack of opposition, the
Court finds reinstatement is warranted based on the grounds that the
unauthorized 2024 Statement of Information and unauthorized Dissolution
Document were prepared and filed by AEC Financial, Amy Benedetti, and Beth
Hubbard in error and without authority, and factual representations within the
Dissolution Document are unauthorized and materially false.
Accordingly, the motion is granted.
Pursuant to Government Code section 12261, subdivision (b)(3), the business
shall be reinstated effective from the date of the filing of the court order
with the Secretary of State. 
It is so ordered.
