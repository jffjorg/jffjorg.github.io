And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court considered the motion for an order approving the transfer of structured settlement payment rights by and between Transferor Marleina Salazar and Petitioner Arrowhead Group. The Court notes that the First Amended Petition fails to provide the "place or places of residence of the payee's minor children or other dependents, if any" as required by Insurance Code section 10139.5, subdivision (c)(3). As a result, the Court orders that Petitioner must submit a revised petition or provide the information at the hearing on the petition. If the information is admitted into the record in accordance with the rules of evidence, the requirement under Insurance Code section 10139.5, subdivision (c) is satisfied.
