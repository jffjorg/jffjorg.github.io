Motions to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiffs Adriana Gonzalez Ceron and Pedro Mendoza Sosa. 
The court has
considered the moving papers.
The court GRANTS Counsel’s motions to be relieved
as counsel for plaintiffs Adriana Gonzalez Ceron and Pedro Mendoza Sosa. 
Discussion
            DAG
Law Firm APC (“Counsel”) moves to be relieved as counsel of record for plaintiffs
Pedro Mendoza Sosa and Adriana Gonzalez Ceron. The court has discretion to
allow an attorney to withdraw and such a motion should be granted provided that
there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly
process of justice. (See Ramirez v.
Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.)
 
CRC, Rule 3.1362
(Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of motion and motion to
be directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general
terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client
relationship why a motion under CCP § 284(2) is brought instead of filing a
consent under CCP § 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's
Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service of the
notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other parties who have
appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on
the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form
(MC-053)).
 
Here, Counsel has complied
with CRC, Rule 3.1362. Counsel filed the required forms and declared that there
has been an irreparable breakdown of the working relationship with the clients.
(DAG Law Firm Decl. ¶ 2.) The Court notes that MC-053 (Proposed Order) lists
the next hearing as the Case Management Conference scheduled for February 7, 2025,
but trial has not been set. Notably, neither client filed an opposition. Thus,
the Court is unaware of any circumstances prejudicing plaintiffs. 
 
The Court
therefore GRANTS Counsel’s motions to be relieved as counsel for plaintiffs
Adriana Gonzalez Ceron and Pedro Mendoza Sosa effective upon proof of service
of this Order. 
 
It is so ordered.
