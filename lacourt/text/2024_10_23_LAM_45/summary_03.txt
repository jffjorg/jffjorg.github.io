And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the petition of Turnpike Films, Inc. to reinstate its active corporate status. The company had been incorporated in California, but an unauthorized Statement of Information and Certificate of Dissolution were filed, which contained materially false representations. The judge finds that the filing of these documents was done without the authority of Turnpike Films, Inc. and that reinstatement is warranted. The company will be reinstated effective from the date of the filing of the court order with the Secretary of State.
