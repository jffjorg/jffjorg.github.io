Motion
for Order Approving Transfer of Structured Settlement Payment Rights
The

may submit the information at the hearing on the petition. If the information
is admitted into the record in accordance with the rules of evidence, the

(Ins. Code. §10139.5, subd. (d).)
 
Background
Petitioner
Arrowhead Group seeks an order approving the transfer of structured settlement
payment rights by and between Transferor Marleina Salazar (“Payee”) and
Petitioner Arrowhead Group (“Transferee”). 
As
of October 18, 2024, there is no opposition. 
Legal Standard 
 
Pursuant to Insurance Code section 10139.5, subdivision (a),
the Court must make the following express findings as to a transfer of
structured settlement payment rights: 
(1)   The transfer is in the best interest of the payee,
taking  into account the welfare and support of the payee's
dependents. 
(2)   The payee has been advised in writing by the transferee
to  seek independent professional advice regarding the
transfer and has either received that advice or knowingly waived
that  advice in writing.  
(3)   The transferee has complied with the notification
requirements pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (f), the transferee has
provided the payee with a disclosure form that complies with Section 10136,
and the transfer agreement complies with sections 10136 and 10138. 
(4)   The transfer does not contravene any applicable statute or
the order of any court or other government authority.  
(5)   The payee reasonably understands the terms of the transfer agreement,
including the terms set forth in the disclosure statement required by Section
10136.
(6)   The payee reasonably understands and does not wish to
exercise the payee's right to cancel the transfer agreement. 
(Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a).) 
 
When determining whether the proposed transfer
should be approved, including whether the transfer is fair, reasonable, and in
the payee’s best interest, taking into account the welfare and support of the
payee’s dependents, the court shall consider the totality of the circumstances,
including, but not limited to: 
 
(1)   the reasonable preference and desire of the
payee to complete the proposed transaction, taking into account the payee’s
age, mental capacity, legal knowledge, and apparent maturity level;  
(2)   the stated purpose of the transfer;  
(3)  
the payee’s
financial and economic situation;  
(4)  
the terms
of the transaction, including whether the payee is transferring monthly or lump
sum payments or all or a portion of his or her future payments;  
(5)  
whether the
future periodic payments were intended to pay for future medical care of the
payee related to the incident that was the subject of the
settlement;  
(6)  
whether the
payee has other means of income or support sufficient to meet the payee’s
future financial obligations for support of payee’s dependents, such as child
support;  
(7)  
whether
there were previous transactions involving payee’s structured settlement
payments; and  
(8)  
whether the
payee and his or her dependents are facing a hardship situation.
(Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (b).) 
 
Any
petition to transfer payments from a structured settlement must be supported by
specific documentation and information as set forth in Insurance Code section
10139.5, subdivision (c). “Every
petition for approval of a transfer of structured settlement payment rights,
except as provided in subdivision (d), shall include, to the extent known after
the transferee has made reasonable inquiry with the payee, all of the
following: 
(1)   The
payee's name, address, and age. 
(2)   The
payee's marital status, and, if married or separated, the name of the payee's
spouse. 
(3)   The
names, ages, and place or places of residence of the payee's minor children or
other dependents, if any.
(4)   The
amounts and sources of the payee's monthly income and financial resources and,
if presently married, the amounts and sources of the monthly income and
financial resources of the payee's spouse. 
(5)   Whether
the payee is currently obligated under any child support or spousal support
order, and, if so, the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of any
individual, entity, or agency that is receiving child or spousal support from
the payee under that order or that has jurisdiction over the order or the
payments in question.
(6)   Information
regarding previous transfers or attempted transfers.” 
(Ins.
Code. §10139.5, subd. (c).)
If
the petitioner fails to attach the information required under Insurance Code
section 10139.5, subdivision (c)(2)-(6), the petitioner may submit the
information at the hearing on the petition. If the information is admitted into
the record in accordance with the rules of evidence, the requirement under Insurance
Code section 10139.5, subdivision (c) is satisfied. (Ins. Code. §10139.5, subd.
(d).)
Discussion 
 
Payee
is 32 years old and lives at 4900 N Grand Ave, Apt 138, Covina, CA 91724.
(Declaration of Marleina Salazar, ¶ 2.) She has been married to Manuel Amaya
for the last five years, and she has two minor children. (Id., ¶ 3.) She
does not have child support obligations. (Id., ¶ 7.) She is employed by
A Change in Trajectory, and she makes $20 per hour. (Id., ¶ 5.) Her
spouse makes $30.00 per hour. (Notice of Errata.) Average monthly expenses are
about $5,000. (Salazar Decl., ¶ 5.)
In
1996, Monica Salazar settled a lawsuit for wrongful death. The settlement that
was reached entitled Payee to future periodic payments. (Salazar Decl., ¶ 6.)
Payee declares the original settlement was intended as compensation for her
injuries; she is no longer being treated for those injuries and as such she has
no continuing need to provide for future medical expenses. (Ibid.) To
the best of her knowledge, the future payments were not intended to pay for my
future living expenses. (Ibid.)
Payee
has agreed to sell her interest in certain payments to Transferee as follows:
One (1) lump sum payment on August 5, 2027 in the amount of One Hundred
Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($100,000.00); plus One Hundred (100) monthly
payments, each in the amount of Three Thousand Thirty Eight and 02/100 Dollars
($3,038.02), beginning with the payment on August 5, 2030, compounding at
(3.00%) every August 5th, through to and including November 5, 2038. (Id.,
¶ 8; Ex. “2” Transfer Agreement.) In return, Payee will receive $175,000, which
she intends to use to purchase a home (Id., ¶ 9); Transferee will
provide a bonus of $5,000, making the purchase price $180,000 (Notice of
Errata, Ex. J.) Payee believes it is in her best interest, and in the best
interests of her family, to enter this transaction. (Salazar Decl., ¶ 9.)

Payee
has not previously assigned a portion of her structured settlement payment
rights on two occasions. (Notice of Errata.) After this transaction, she will
retain the rights to the following payments under this annuity: Seventy (70)
monthly payments, each in the amount of Two Thousand Five Hundred Forty Four
and 30/100 Dollars ($2,544.30), beginning with the payment on October 5, 2024,
compounding at (3.00%) every August 5th, through to and including July 5, 2030;
plus Twenty (20) monthly payments, each in the amount of Three Thousand Eight
Hundred Forty Eight and 49/100 Dollars ($3,848.49), beginning with the payment
on December 5, 2038, compounding at (3.00%) every August 5th, through to and
including July 5, 2040 and for life thereafter. (Salazar Decl., ¶ 11.) There
are no additional beneficiaries under the annuity policy that would qualify as
interested parties to this action entitled to receive notice under Cal. Ins.
Code § 10134(g) et seq. (Id., ¶ 12.)
Payee
received and read the separate written disclosure required by California
Insurance Code section 10136(b), at least 10 days before she signed the
Transfer Agreement. (Id., ¶ 13; Ex. “4” Notice of Hearing.) She has been
advised by Transferee of her right to seek independent counsel and financial
advice in connection with the petition for court approval of the transfer
agreement; she waives that advice and does not wish to retain such an
independent advisor. (Id., ¶ 14.) She has received and reviewed copies
of (1) the Transfer Agreement offered by Arrowhead Group; (2) a copy of the
Petition for Court Approval for this transfer; (3) a copy of the disclosures
required by California Insurance Code section 10136(b); (4) a copy of the
Notice regarding the hearing on this Petition for Approval of Transfer
Structured Settlement Payment Rights as required by California Insurance Code
section 10139(c)(2); and (5) a copy of the advisory statement as required by
California Insurance Code section 10139.5(e). (Id., ¶ 15.) She
understands the nature and terms of the transaction and is entering into the transaction
with Transferee on her own free will and volition. (Id., ¶ 17.)

Payee’s spouse, GE Capital Assignment Corporation (Annuity Issuer), Genworth

independent counsel and financial advice in connection with the petition for
court approval of the transfer agreement; she waives that advice and does not
wish to retain such an independent advisor. (Salazar Decl., ¶ 14.)
“(3)
The transferee has complied with the notification requirements pursuant to

disclosure form that complies with Section 10136, and the transfer agreement
complies with Sections 10136 and 10138.” (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (a)(3).) Payee received and

Requirements
of Insurance Code section 10139.5, subdivision (c) 
“(1)
The payee's name, address, and age.” (Ins. Code, § 10139.5, subd. (c)(1).) Payee’s name, age, and address are
provided. (Salazar Decl., ¶ 2.)

minor children. The children presumably reside at the same address as Payee (4900

Conclusion

The
First Amended Petition fails to provide the “place or places of residence of
the payee's minor children or other dependents, if any” as required by Insurance Code §10139.5, subdivision
(c)(3). Petitioner must submit a revised petition. Alternatively, Petitioner
may submit the information at the hearing on the petition. If the information
is admitted into the record in accordance with the rules of evidence, the
requirement under Insurance Code section 10139.5, subdivision (c) is satisfied.
(Ins. Code. §10139.5, subd. (d).)
It is so ordered.
