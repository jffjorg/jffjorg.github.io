And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the demurrer filed by Ford Motor Company, which argues that the Complaint's sixth cause of action for concealment fails to state sufficient facts. The Judge finds that the Complaint adequately alleges a defect in the transmission of the vehicle, a transactional relationship between Ford and the plaintiff, and a duty to disclose the defect. The Judge also rejects Ford's argument that the economic loss rule bars the plaintiff's fraudulent inducement claim. As a result, the demurrer is overruled, and Ford must file an answer within 20 days.
