And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for fraudulent concealment and granting the motion to strike punitive damages. The plaintiff, Elana Mossazadeh, alleged that the defendant, American Honda Motor Co., Inc., concealed defects in a 2021 Honda Odyssey that she purchased. The court found that the complaint did not sufficiently allege a direct transaction between the parties, and therefore, the defendant did not have a duty to disclose the defects. The court also found that the plaintiff's allegations were insufficient to establish a fraudulent concealment cause of action. As a result, the demurrer was sustained, and the motion to strike punitive damages was granted without leave to amend.
