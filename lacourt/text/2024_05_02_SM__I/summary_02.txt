Here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the ex parte application to continue the trial, which was set on November 28, 2023. The application was made on May 1, 2024, after a speedy inquiry of the expert, but the expert did not respond until a couple of weeks ago. The expert has a pre-planned vacation between May 15 and May 29, which conflicts with the trial beginning on May 20. The court is willing to accommodate the witness's schedule, and the trial estimate is 12 days. The court may need to continue the trial if it has another case lined up. The parties should check the court's trial calendar periodically to see if the court is engaged in another trial.
