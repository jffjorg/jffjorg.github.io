Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to continue the trial. The defendant had complained about the plaintiff's lack of agreement to a deposition date, but the court has not seen evidence of the defendant's diligence in seeking the court's aid. The court assumes that the deposition is complete. The judge notes that the court has a busy trial schedule for the next few months and advises the parties to check the trial status periodically. The judge also reminds the parties to familiarize themselves with the court's rules and procedures. If the trial is not feasible on June 10, the court may continue the trial at a later date.
