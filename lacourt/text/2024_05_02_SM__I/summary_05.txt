English-text summary:
The judge's tentative ruling grants a temporary restraining order (TRO) and sets a hearing for a preliminary injunction. The dispute is about a lease and parking access. The plaintiff, the tenant, seeks to restore the status quo ante by allowing them to use the five parking spots provided for in the lease. The defendant, the landlord, removed the valet service and prohibited the plaintiff from using the tandem spots. The judge finds that the plaintiff has made a strong showing of a likelihood of success on the merits and grants the TRO, allowing the plaintiff to restore the parking status quo. The TRO will last until the preliminary injunction hearing.
