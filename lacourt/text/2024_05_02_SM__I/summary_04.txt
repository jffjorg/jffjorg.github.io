And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is in response to a demurrer brought by the tenant in an unlawful eviction case. The defendant raises two grounds for demurrer. The first ground is that the plaintiff did not specify the basis for the alleged exemption, citing to the wrong statute at the last demurrer hearing. The judge agrees that the plaintiff cited to the wrong statute but believes that the correct statute, Civil Code section 1946.2(e)(8), is properly set forth and that more precision is not required. The second ground is that the 3-day notice improperly suggests calendar days instead of business days. The judge agrees that the notice could be more clearly written but believes that it will suffice. The judge rules that the demurrer is overruled and requires the defendant to answer by May 7, 2024.
