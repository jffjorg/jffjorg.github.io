  Case Number:  21SMCV00149    Hearing Date:   May 2, 2024    Dept:  I This is a motion to continue the trial.  The motion is DENIED.  
 
The court set the initial trial date about 17 months
ago.  That was plenty of time to get
everything done that needed to be done. 
Defendant complains that plaintiff has not agreed to a date for the
deposition despite diligence.  But the
court has not seen evidence of diligence and the court does not recall
defendant seeking this court’s aid if plaintiff was truly being
recalcitrant.  Defendant’s moving papers
suggested that the deposition would take place on April 9, and April 19.  The court assumes, therefore, that the
deposition is complete.  If not, the
court will discuss what the appropriate steps are to ensure that plaintiff
cooperates in getting the case ready for trial. 
All of that said, the court has a very busy trial schedule for the next
few months.  The parties can check back
periodically to see if the court is in trial or not.  Specifically, the court has a long trial
starting Tuesday of next week and a long trial that, although set for the
following week, will probably be ready for trial a couple weeks later.  If both of those trials actually go (and both
are very old cases), then this case will not go to trial on June 10.  If it is plain to the court that such is the
case, the court would be inclined to continue this trial.
 
The court reminds the parties to be familiar with its FSC
and trial rules, which can be found on line. 
The court assumes that, consistent with its instructions in December
2022, the parties have already started to meet and confer to ensure that they
will be able to comply with those requirements. 
All dates remain on calendar until and unless they are moved by the
court.
