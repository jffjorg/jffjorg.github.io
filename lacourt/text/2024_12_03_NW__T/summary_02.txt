And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on an ex parte application filed by the plaintiff, De Gasca, to schedule depositions. The judge denies the application, citing that there is no explanation for the lack of progress in scheduling the depositions since October. The judge also criticizes the late application, which is scheduled for the same day as the Final Settlement Conference, and suggests that it is in bad faith. The judge also rules on various motions in limine filed by both parties, granting or denying them based on their merits. The case is set to proceed to the scheduled hearing on December 3, 2024, with the FSC taking place as planned.
