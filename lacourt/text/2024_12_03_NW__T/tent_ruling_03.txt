 Case Number:  24VECV01457    Hearing Date:   December 3, 2024    Dept:  T  Brown v Kranzler 24VECV01457
Tentative ruling on motion to compel plaintiff to answer interrogatories set for 12/3/2024:  No opposition was timely filed.  Grant.  Verified answers without objections due by 12/13/2024.
The court sets an OSC as to whether plaintiff’s counsel has abandoned the case.  Plaintiff’s counsel did not provide responses to discovery (not even objections), did not respond to the meet and confer email, and did not file an opposition or a response/explanation about why the discovery responses were not served.  The absence of responses indicates to the court that plaintiff’s counsel may have abandoned the case.  Personal appearance is required at the OSC set for __________________.
