And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel the plaintiff to answer interrogatories. Since no opposition was filed in a timely manner, the court grants the motion. The plaintiff's counsel is now required to provide verified answers without objections by December 13, 2024.

Additionally, the court has set an Order to Show Cause (OSC) to determine if the plaintiff's counsel has abandoned the case. The court's concerns arise from the counsel's failure to respond to discovery, meet and confer email, and file an opposition or response. The judge believes that the absence of responses may indicate that the counsel has abandoned the case. A personal appearance is required at the OSC, which is set for a date yet to be determined.
