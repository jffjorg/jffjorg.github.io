Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration of the plaintiffs' claims. The plaintiffs, Karen Peavler and Jay Peavler, filed a complaint alleging medical malpractice and loss of consortium against the defendants, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, Inc., Southern California Permanente Medical Group, Marc Dana Weiss, M.D., and DOES 1-100. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs' claims are subject to binding arbitration under the Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage (HMO) Evidence of Coverage (Agreement/EOC). The judge found that the defendants had met their burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement and that the plaintiffs had not met their burden of proof to show that the arbitration agreement was invalid. The judge also found that Health & Safety Code ยง 1363.1, which requires certain disclosures in arbitration agreements, is preempted by the Federal Medicare Act. As a result, the judge granted the defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stayed the action pending arbitration.
