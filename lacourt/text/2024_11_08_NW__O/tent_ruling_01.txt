     CASE NO.: 24VECV01624
 
ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO COMPEL ARBITRATION



I.
       BACKGROUND 
This case arises
out of injuries Plaintiff Karen Peavler (“Karen”) allegedly suffered while under
the care of Defendants Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (erroneously sued as Kaiser
Foundation Hospitals, Inc.), Southern California Permanente Medical Group, and
Marc Dana Weiss, M.D. (collectively, “Defendants”). As a result of her
injuries, Karen alleges medical malpractice against Defendants, and her
husband, Plaintiff Jay Peavler (“Jay”)(collectively, “Plaintiffs”), alleges
loss of consortium. 
Defendants now seek
to compel Plaintiffs’ claims to arbitration. 
II.           
PROCEDURAL

On April 10, 2024,
Plaintiffs filed their Complaint, alleging (1) Professional Negligence (Medical
Malpractice); and (2) Loss of Consortium.  
On June 5, 2024,
Defendants filed their Answer. 
On September 4,
2024, Defendants filed the instant Motion to Compel Arbitration (“Motion”). 
On October 28,
2024, Plaintiffs filed their Opposition. 
On November 1,
2024, Defendants filed their Reply. 
III.        
LEGAL STANDARD
“The party seeking
to compel arbitration bears the burden of proving the existence of a valid
arbitration agreement.” (Avila v. Southern Cal. Specialty Care, Inc. (2018)
20 Cal.App.5th 835, 844.) 
“California courts
traditionally have maintained a strong preference for arbitration as a speedy
and inexpensive method of dispute resolution… To this end, arbitration
agreements should be liberally construed, … with doubts concerning the scope of
arbitrable issues being resolved in favor of arbitration.” (Market Ins.
Corp. v. Integrity Ins. Co. (1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1095, 1098 (cleaned up).)
“This strong policy has resulted in the general rule that arbitration should be
upheld unless it can be said with assurance that an arbitration clause is not
susceptible to an interpretation covering the asserted dispute.... It seems
clear that the burden must fall upon the party opposing arbitration to
demonstrate that an arbitration clause cannot be interpreted to require
arbitration of the dispute.” (Bono v. David (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 1055,
1062 (cleaned up).)
California law
incorporates many of the basic policy objectives contained in the Federal
Arbitration Act (“FAA”), including a presumption in favor of arbitrability. (See
Engalla v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 971-972.)
The Court is empowered by Code of Civil Procedure § 1281.2[1]
to compel parties to arbitrate disputes pursuant to an agreement to do so.¿¿¿ 
The party opposing
the petition to compel arbitration bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence any fact necessary to its defense. (See Giuliano
v. Inland Empire Personnel, Inc. (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1276, 1284.)
Accordingly, under both the Federal Arbitration Act and California law,
arbitration agreements are valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, except on such
grounds that exist at law or equity for voiding a contract. (See Winter v.
Window Fashions Professions, Inc. (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 943, 947.)
Thus, in deciding a
motion to compel arbitration, trial courts must first decide whether an
enforceable arbitration agreement exists between the parties, and then
determine the second gateway issue of whether the claims are covered within the
scope of the agreement. (See Omar v. Ralphs Grocery Co. (2004) 118
Cal.App.4th 955, 961.)
IV.         
ANALYSIS 
A.            
Plaintiffs’ Claims are Covered by a Valid
Arbitration Agreement. 
The arbitration
proponent must first recite verbatim, or provide a copy of, the alleged
agreement. (See Sprunk v. Prisma LLC (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 785, 793.) A
movant can meet this initial burden “‘by attaching a copy of the arbitration
agreement purportedly bearing the opposing party’s signature.’” (Id. (quoting
Rules of Court, rule 3.1330).) “[U]nless there is a dispute over authenticity,
it is sufficient for a party moving to compel arbitration to recite the terms
of the governing provision.” (Id. (citing Condee v. Longwood Mgmt.
Corp. (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 215, 219).) “A voluntary acceptance of the
benefit of a transaction is equivalent to a consent to all the obligations
arising from it, so far as the facts are known, or ought to be known, to the
person accepting.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1589.) 
Here, Defendants argue
Plaintiffs’ claims are “subject to binding arbitration pursuant to the
provisions of the Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage (HMO) Evidence of Coverage
(“Agreement/EOC”) under which Ms. Peavler was enrolled as a Medicare-eligible
Kaiser Senior Advantage member at the time of the medical care at issue.”
(Motion, pg. 2.) Defendants provide a copy of the Agreement/EOC. (See Declaration
of Nancy Garcia filed September 4, 2024 (“Garcia Decl.”), ¶ 5, Ex. A.) The
Agreement/EOC includes a “Binding arbitration” provision, whereby Karen agreed to
arbitrate her (and her spouse Jay’s) claims. (See Garcia Decl., ¶5, Ex.
A, pp. 215-218.) A copy of the Agreement/EOC was mailed to Karen “when she
first enrolled, and thereafter a notice was sent to her annually, pursuant to
CMS requirements, making the Agreement/EOC available upon request, including by
online deliver in September 2022, prior to the incident at issue.” (Motion, pg.
3, Garcia Decl., ¶¶ 8-10.)
Defendants also
provide a copy of the opt-out notice which was mailed to Karen on October 27,
2017, and notified Karen of her opportunity to opt-out of the arbitration
program. (See Declaration of Alicia McWilliams filed September 4, 2024,
¶ 5, Ex. D.) Karen did not opt-out of the arbitration program. (See Declaration
of Aura Armas filed September 4, 2024, ¶ 5.) 
Defendants have
therefore proved the existence of a valid arbitration agreement that governs Plaintiffs’
claims. The burden therefore shifts to Plaintiffs to prove by a preponderance
of the evidence the facts necessary to their defense.
Plaintiffs argue Defendants
failed to comply with Health & Safety Code § 1363.1, a California
statute which requires, among other things, that an arbitration agreement “clearly
state whether the plan uses binding arbitration to settle disputes,” and
shall contain disclosures “prominently displayed on the enrollment form signed
by each subscriber” and “immediately before the signature line” (Health &
Saf. Code § 1361.1(a), (b), (d) (emphasis added).). Plaintiffs argue the
Agreement/EOC at issue does not comply with these requirements. (See Opposition,
pp. 8.) Either way, Plaintiffs argue, Defendants’ declarations lack any
foundation or personal knowledge that Karen ever received notification of binding
arbitration or the op-out notice. (See Opposition, pg. 8.) By contrast,
Plaintiffs submitted Karen’s declaration, whereby she declares she never
received such notices. (See Declaration of Karen Peavler filed October
28, 2024.) Plaintiff does not submit additional arguments or evidence. 
In reply, Defendants
first argue the Agreement/EOC opt-out notice was properly authenticated as
business records of Defendants. (See Reply, pg. 3.) Defendants also
rebut Plaintiffs’ arguments concerning Health & Safety Code § 1363.1,
arguing that the statute is preempted by the Federal Medicare Act. (Id.)

The Court finds
Plaintiffs have not met their burden of proof. The Court first overrules
Plaintiffs’ objections. Defendants’ various declarations are supported by sufficient
foundation and personal knowledge. Therefore, the Court finds the Agreement/EOC
and the opt-out notice are properly authenticated business records. 
The Court also
finds Plaintiffs’ arguments concerning Defendants’ alleged failure to comply
with Health & Safety Code § 1363.1 unavailing, as Health & Safety Code
§ 1363.1 is preempted by the Federal Medicare Act. The 2003 Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act, 42 U.S.C. §
1395w-26(b)(3)[2],
provides that Medicare standards preempt state laws applicable to health plans
(with the exception of state licensing or plan solvency). Health &
Safety Code § 1363.1 does not relate to licensing or solvency. Therefore, it
has been pre-empted by the federal statute. (See Clay v. Permanente Med.
Group, Inc. (N.D. Cal. 2007) 540 F.Supp.2d 1101, 1108-1109; Drissi v.
Kaiser Found. Hospitals, Inc. (N.D. Cal. 2008) 543 F.Supp.2d 1076, 1080.) 
Plaintiff also
cites no legal authority for the proposition that Kaiser is required to
establish a procedure that ensures a member have “actual knowledge” of the
arbitration provision in order to enforce it. In fact, the California
Supreme Court has dismissed the idea of requiring this type of proof. (See
Madden v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (1976) 17 Cal.3d 699, 709, n.
11.)   
Accordingly, the
Court GRANTS Defendants’ Motion.
V.       CONCLUSION
Based on the
foregoing, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ Motion to Compel Arbitration and stays
the action pending arbitration. 
          IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:
November 8, 2024
