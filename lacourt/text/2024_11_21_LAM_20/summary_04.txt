And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary adjudication with respect to the sixth cause of action, which alleges breach of fiduciary duty. The motion was denied because the plaintiff failed to submit a memorandum of points and authorities or a separate statement of undisputed fact, as required by the court's rules. The plaintiff is also seeking to file a Third Amended Complaint, and the court has ordered the plaintiff to give notice of this request.
