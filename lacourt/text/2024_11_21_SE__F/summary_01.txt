And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Parsec, Inc., has moved to continue the trial, which is currently scheduled to begin on February 10, 2025. The motion is unopposed and is granted. The continuance is necessary because the court's calendar is congested, and the defendant is unable to secure a hearing date for its motion for summary judgment before the current trial date. The court also notes that the potential substitution of a successor-in-interest into the action warrants a trial continuance. The new trial date is set for around July 28, 2025, and all pre-trial deadlines will correspond with the new trial date. The court will confer with the parties to select the new filing and trial dates.
