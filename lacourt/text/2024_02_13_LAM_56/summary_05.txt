And here is the summary in English text:

The court has considered the motion to transfer venue filed by defendant Linda J. Maultsby, which was filed prematurely before an answer was filed to the complaint. The court notes that the evidence presented does not sufficiently demonstrate that the identified potential witnesses' testimony is admissible, relevant, and material to an issue in the case. Therefore, the court denies the motion without prejudice.
