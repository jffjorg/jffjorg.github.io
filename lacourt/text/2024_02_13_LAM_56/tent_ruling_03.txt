Judge: Holly J. Fujie
 



 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (“Moving Defendant”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Plaintiffs Council of Housing Professionals (the “Union”),
Billye Fairley (“Fairley”), Arturo Aguilar (“Aguilar”), and Karla Alas (“Alas”)
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”)[1]
 
The Court has considered the moving, opposition and reply
papers.  
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff’s complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges: (1) violation of the
Unruh Act; (2) negligence; and (3) violation of Business and Professions Code
section 17200.  
 
 
In relevant part, the Complaint alleges: In April 2022, Fairley and
Alas visited one of Moving Defendant’s branches to open a new account for the
Union.  (Complaint ¶ 12.)  Fairley and Alias were told that they needed
to bring a copy of the Union’s lease agreement. 
(Complaint ¶ 13.)  When Plaintiffs
told Moving Defendant’s representative that they did not have a lease agreement
for the Union’s physical address, Moving Defendant’s representative instructed
them to use Fairley’s home address.  (See
Complaint ¶¶ 14-19.)  On or about
August 1, 2022, Plaintiffs learned that the Union’s accounts had been zeroed
out because the Union’s physical address had not been confirmed.  (Complaint ¶¶ 20-22.)  Although Moving Defendant eventually refunded
the Union’s money, it charged exorbitant fees. 
(Complaint ¶ 32.)  Plaintiffs
allege that Moving Defendant’s actions were discriminatory and based on the Individual
Plaintiffs’ race.  (Complaint ¶ 33.)
 
Moving Defendant filed a demurrer (the “Demurrer”) on the grounds
that the Complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of
action. 
 
DISCUSSION
Meet and Confer
The meet and
confer requirement has been met.
 
Legal Standard
A demurrer tests
the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law.  (Durell
v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)  The court accepts as true all material
factual allegations and affords them a liberal construction, but it does not
consider conclusions of fact or law, opinions, speculation, or allegations
contrary to law or judicially noticed facts. 
(Shea Homes Limited Partnership v.
County of Alameda (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1246, 1254.)  With respect to a demurrer, the complaint
must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the facts
pleaded.  (Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 513, 517.)  
 
Standing
Under California Code
of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 371, every action must be prosecuted in
the name of the real party in interest, except as otherwise provided by
statute.  (CCP § 371.)  A party who is not the real party in interest
lacks standing to sue.  (Redevelopment
Agency of San Diego v. San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (2003) 111
Cal.App.4th 912, 920.)  A real party in
interest ordinarily is defined as the person possessing the right sued
upon by reason of the substantive law.  (Id.
at 920-21.)  A complaint filed by
someone other than the real party in interest is subject to general demurrer on
the ground that it fails to state a cause of action.  (Id. at 921.)  
 
Moving Defendant
argues that the Individual Plaintiffs lack standing because the wrongdoing
alleged in the Complaint only affected the Union.  The Court notes that the Individual
Plaintiffs only allege a violation of the Unruh Act.  Under the Unruh Act, standing extends not
only to those directly injured but also to those who allege that they were
indirectly impacted by the discriminatory practice.  (See Midpeninsula Citizens for Fair
Housing v. Westwood Investors (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1377, 1388.)  The Court therefore declines to find that the
allegations of the Complaint preclude the Individual Plaintiffs from pursuing
the Unruh Act claim. 
 
First Cause of Action
The Unruh Act
provides: all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal,
and no matter what their sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin,
disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sexual
orientation, citizenship, primary language, or immigration status are entitled
to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or
services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.  (Civ. Code § 51, subd. (b).)  Unless an Unruh Act claim is based on an Americans
with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) violation, the Unruh Act requires a claimant to
prove intentional discrimination.  (Martinez
v. Cot'n Wash, Inc. (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th 1026, 1036.)  A claimant may not rely on the effects of a facially
neutral policy on a particular group or infer solely from such effects a
discriminatory intent.  (Id.)  Thus, absent an ADA violation, the Unruh Act
requires allegations supporting willful, affirmative misconduct with the
specific intent to accomplish discrimination on the basis of a protected trait.  (Id.)
 
            The
Complaint summarily alleges that Moving Defendant’s actions were racially
motivated.  The Complaint includes no
factual details to support the conclusion that Moving Defendant’s actions were
discriminatory.  The Court therefore
SUSTAINS the Demurrer to the first cause of action with 20 days leave to
amend.  
             
 
 
Second Cause of Action
            The elements of negligence are: (1) duty;
(2) breach; (3) causation; and (4) damages. (Peredia v. HR Mobile Services,
Inc. (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 680, 687.) 
A bank has a duty to act with reasonable care in its transactions with
its depositors.  (Kurtz-Ahlers, LLC v.
Bank of America, N.A. (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 952, 956.)  
 
In general, there is no recovery in tort for
negligently inflicted “purely economic losses,” meaning financial harm
unaccompanied by physical or property damage. 
(Sheen v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 905,
922.)  The primary exception to the
general rule of no-recovery for negligently inflicted purely economic losses is
where the plaintiff and the defendant have a “special relationship.”  (Southern California Gas Leak Cases
(2019) 7 Cal.5th 391, 400.)
 
The Court finds that the Complaint
sufficiently alleges a source of Moving Defendant’s duty as the Union’s banking
institution.  The Court agrees, however,
that as alleged, the Union’s losses are purely economic and there is no special
relationship alleged that would override the economic loss rule and allow the
Union to recover tort damages.  (See Sheen
v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
(2022) 12 Cal.5th 905, 922-25.)  The
Court therefore SUSTAINS the Demurrer to the second cause of action with 20
days leave to amend. 
 
Third
Cause of Action
The UCL prohibits any unlawful, unfair
or fraudulent business act or practice. 
(Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200; see Clark v. Superior Court
(2010) 50 Cal.4th 605, 610.)  To show a violation of the UCL, a plaintiff
must establish: (1) a loss or deprivation of money or property sufficient to
qualify as injury in fact, i.e., economic injury; and (2) show that that economic injury was the result
of, i.e., caused
by, the unfair business practice or false advertising that is the
gravamen of the claim.  (Kwikset Corp.
v. Superior Court (2011) 51 Cal.4th 310, 322.)  A
business act or practice only needs to meet one of the requirements to be
considered unfair competition under the UCL. 
(Daro v. Superior Court (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1079, 1093.) Statutory
causes of action must be alleged with particularity.  (Lopez v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist.
(1985) 40 Cal.3d 780, 795.)  
 
            The
Complaint fails to specify the predicate unlawful, unfair or fraudulent
business acts that form the basis of the UCL claim.  (See Complaint ¶¶ The Court therefore
SUSTAINS the Demurrer to the third cause of action with 20 days leave to
amend.  
 
 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
