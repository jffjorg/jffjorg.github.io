And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has considered the demurrer filed by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (Moving Defendant) and the opposition and reply papers submitted by the Plaintiffs. The judge has determined that the Complaint fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action in three of the four causes of action.

Firstly, the judge has sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action, which alleges a violation of the Unruh Act, with 20 days leave to amend. The judge found that the Complaint lacks factual details to support the conclusion that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.'s actions were discriminatory.

Secondly, the judge has sustained the demurrer to the second cause of action, which alleges negligence, with 20 days leave to amend. The judge found that the Complaint fails to allege a special relationship between the Union and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. that would override the economic loss rule and allow the Union to recover tort damages.

Thirdly, the judge has sustained the demurrer to the third cause of action, which alleges a violation of the Unruh Act, with 20 days leave to amend. The judge found that the Complaint fails to specify the predicate unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business acts that form the basis of the UCL claim.

The judge has given Moving Defendant 20 days to amend the demurrer and has ordered the parties to notify the court of any changes.
