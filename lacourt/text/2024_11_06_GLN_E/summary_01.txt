Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed by Defendant A. Elich Architect (AEA) against Plaintiff Oshein Khachikian. The motions seek to compel further responses to discovery requests and to impose sanctions on Plaintiff for failing to meet and confer.

The judge denies the first motion as moot with respect to compelling further responses, as Plaintiff has already provided supplemental responses. However, the judge finds that Plaintiff's failure to meet and confer warrants sanctions and orders Plaintiff to pay AEA $1,170.00 for the time spent preparing and filing the motion.

The second motion is also denied as moot with respect to compelling further responses, as Plaintiff has already provided supplemental responses. However, the judge finds that AEA is entitled to sanctions and orders Plaintiff to pay AEA $1,170.00 for the time spent preparing and filing the motion.

The judge notes that AEA's motion was improperly combined into one motion when it should have been two separate motions, and that AEA should be prepared to discuss its sanctions request at the hearing. The judge also finds that Plaintiff's argument against sanctions is nonsensical and ignores the fact that Plaintiff failed to meet and confer despite several attempts by AEA.
