Summary:
The tentative ruling addresses two causes of action: intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of the implied warranty of habitability. The court rules that the demurrer to the seventh cause of action (intentional infliction of emotional distress) is overruled, as the allegations may be reasonably regarded as extreme and outrageous. The court rules that the demurrer to the twelfth cause of action (unpermitted/illegally constructed unit in violation of common law) is sustained, as the Building Code does not provide a private right of action. The court notes that if Plaintiff is attempting to bring a claim for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, it should make those allegations in the second cause of action.
