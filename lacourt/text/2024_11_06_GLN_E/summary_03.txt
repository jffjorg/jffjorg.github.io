Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in YAML format:

**Case Information**

* Case Number: 24NNCV02131
* Hearing Date: November 6, 2024
* Dept: E
* Case Name: Rosemead and Del Mar, Goss Family LLC v. E-Z Car Rental, Inc., Roger Farraj, and Does 1-10

**Parties**

* Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant: Rosemead and Del Mar, Goss Family LLC, a California limited liability company
* Defendant/Cross-Complainant: E-Z Car Rental, Inc., a California corporation; Roger Farraj, an individual

**Relief Requested**

* Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant demurs to the Cross-Complaint for declaratory relief on three grounds:
	1. The Cross-Complaint is subject to demurrer under California Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10(a) because the court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the cause of action.
	2. The Cross-Complaint is subject to demurrer under California Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10(c) because there is another action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action, and the subject matter has already been judicially decided in that other action.
	3. The Cross-Complaint is subject to demurrer under California Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10(e) because the Cross-Complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute its sole cause of action for declaratory relief.

**Background**

* Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant alleging breach of contract and breach of guaranty.
* Defendant/Cross-Complainant filed a Cross-Complaint for declaratory relief.
* The Cross-Complaint alleges that Plaintiff is not entitled to the $20,000 recapture of inducement provision because the lease does not mention it as a rent reimbursement credit or inducement for signing the lease.

**Procedural Analysis**

* The Court notes that the parties did not meet and confer as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41.
* The Court finds that Plaintiff's argument that the issue of whether the $20,000 amount would be included as "rent due" was already adjudged in favor of Plaintiff in the unlawful detainer action is availing.

**Tentative Ruling**

* The Court sustains the demurrer to the Cross-Complaint without leave to amend because the issue sought to be relitigated has already been judicially decided in the unlawful detainer action.
* The Court grants Plaintiff's requests for judicial notice.

**Significant Statements**

* "The distinguishing characteristic of the action for declaratory relief is that it may be brought before an actual invasion of rights has occurred."
* "The controversy must be justiciable, as distinguished from a difference or dispute of a hypothetical or abstract character, and it must be definite, concrete and of a character which admits of specific and conclusive relief by judgment."
