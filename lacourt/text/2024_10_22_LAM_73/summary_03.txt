And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Superstar Monitoring LLC et al. v. Sharp Group LLC et al. (23STCV31024). The case concerns a premises liability action brought by plaintiffs against defendants, alleging various causes of action, including breach of contract, breach of warranty, and negligence.

The defendants filed motions to compel plaintiff Superstar Monitoring LLC's responses to form interrogatories and request for production of documents, as well as a request for sanctions. The plaintiff filed opposition to the motions, arguing that the defendants failed to meet and confer and failed to file a separate statement.

The court denied the defendants' motions, finding that they failed to meet and confer and did not file a separate statement. The court also granted the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions against the defendants in the reduced amount of $1,807.26, to be paid to the plaintiff's counsel within 30 days of the date of the order.

The court's ruling is based on the plaintiff's failure to provide sufficient responses to the defendants' discovery requests, as well as the defendants' failure to meet and confer and file a separate statement. The court found that the defendants' motions were procedurally deficient and that the plaintiff's responses were sufficient.
