Here, Plaintiff complied with all requirements
for a default judgment. 
 
Plaintiff
submitted a summary of the case. According to Plaintiff, Defendants have
refused to return funds that they are not entitled to and that were
inadvertently transferred to Defendants’ bank account. GROVE BANK
& TRUST (“GROVE BANK”) was a bank and was insured under Bond/Policy No.
106500852 issued by Travelers (“POLICY”), which provided coverage, among other
things, to pay for loss sustained as a result of a professional services
liability coverage in accordance with the terms and conditions of the POLICY.
(Cook Decl., ¶ 3, Exh. 1; Complaint, ¶ 8.)
ATLANTIC REY
CORP. (“ARC”) was a customer of GROVE BANK and held an account at GROVE BANK.
(Cook Decl., ¶ 4; Complaint, ¶ 9.)
In April
2021, GROVE BANK received instructions from ARC to wire transfer funds from
ARC’s account at GROVE BANK to the beneficiary VSD LIVING TRUST in the amount
of $1,100.00. (Cook Decl., ¶ 5, Exh. 2.) GROVE BANK followed ARC’s instructions
but GROVE BANK made a mistake when entering the amount to be transferred and
transferred $1,100,000.00, instead of $1,100.00. (Cook Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. 3;
Complaint, ¶ 10.) ARC made a demand on that GROVE BANK credit its account for
the overpayment in the amount of $1,098,900 and GROVE BANK credited ARC’s account.
(Cook Decl., ¶ 7; Complaint, ¶ 1.) Although GROVE BANK made a wire transfer
recall to the receiving bank, the receiving bank informed GROVE BANK that the
TRUST had already absconded with the funds. (Cook Decl., ¶ 8; Complaint, ¶ 12.) On May 3, 2021, GROVE BANK made a demand that TRUST and GINTARUS
VILUTIS (“VILUTIS”) return the funds that were sent to TRUST in error. TRUST
and VILUTIS have refused and continue to refuse to return the funds to GROVE
BANK. (Cook Decl., ¶ 9, Exh. 4; Complaint, ¶ 13.)
 
In
support, Plaintiff submitted the declaration of Julianne Cook, Claims
Counsel, Recovery Management Unit for Plaintiff Travelers Casualty and
Insurance Company of America. (Cook Decl., ¶ 1.) Cook
attached a copy of the Wire Transfer Request Form, wire transaction details,
and demand letter sent to Defendants. (Cook Decl., Exhs. 2-4.) Plaintiff also submitted the declaration
of its counsel, David Billings, who provided a computation of the interest. (Billings
Decl., ¶ 11.)
 
Since
Plaintiff has complied with the requirements, Plaintiff’s request for default
judgment is GRANTED.
 
III.
CONCLUSION 
 
Plaintiff’s request for default judgment is GRANTED.
