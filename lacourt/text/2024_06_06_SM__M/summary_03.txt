And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees in the amount of $24,539.00 against the defendant, Fiore Management Inc. The court has already found that the plaintiff is the prevailing party on the contract action. The plaintiff meets its burden to show its reasonable fees by presenting counsel's verified bills, which show a reasonable amount of time spent on the action (66.5 hours) and a reasonable hourly rate of $375.00/hr. The defendant fails to oppose the motion, so it fails to show that the above amount is excessive, duplicative, or unrelated.
