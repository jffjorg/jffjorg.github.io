The client will have sufficient time to retain new counsel or seek a continuance, and therefore will not be prejudiced by the withdrawal. The court has exercised its discretion to grant the motion, taking into account the principles outlined in CCP ยง 284(2) and Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct, 3-700(A)(2).
