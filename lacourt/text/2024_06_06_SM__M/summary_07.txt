Here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case California Lawyers Group LLC v. Durst, et al. (Case No. 23SMCV06025). The plaintiff, California Lawyers Group LLC, moved to compel the defendant, Durst, et al., to respond to its initial discovery requests, including interrogatories and demands for production of documents. The court finds that the defendant failed to respond to these requests in a timely manner, waiving all objections. The court also finds that the defendant failed to respond to requests for admissions, necessitating mandatory sanctions. The court imposes a sanction of $601.67 against the defendant and its counsel of record, jointly and severally, to be paid within 30 days. The court denies the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $1,620.00, finding that the imposition of sanctions would be unjust in this case.
