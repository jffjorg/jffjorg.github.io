Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The court grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment and finds that the defendant did not make any actionable misrepresentations about the condition of the vehicle. The court concludes that the plaintiff could not reasonably rely on any assurances of the quality of the vehicle, as the disclaimer clearly stated that the vehicle was sold "as-is." The court also finds that the parol evidence rule applies to prevent the introduction of extrinsic evidence to alter the terms of the written agreement. As a result, the court grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment and denies the plaintiff's request for leave to amend the complaint.
