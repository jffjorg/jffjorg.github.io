And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Julia Cheverez v. Bink Corp, denying the Plaintiff's motion to compel the deposition of Greg Alcaraz, a former caregiver of the decedent. The Judge finds that Alcaraz was not an employee of Bink Corp at the time of the deposition notice and therefore cannot be compelled to testify. The Judge also finds that the Plaintiff was reasonably misled by Defendant's discovery responses, which implied that Alcaraz was still an employee of Bink Corp. As a result, the Judge declines to award sanctions, finding that both parties share responsibility for the dispute.
