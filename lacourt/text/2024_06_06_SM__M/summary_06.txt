And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a motion to quash service of summons and set aside default filed by defendant S. Bertram Inc. The defendant argues that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over it because it does not have minimum contacts with California. The plaintiff claims that the defendant has minimum contacts with California because it placed its product into the stream of commerce, which could potentially end up in California.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has failed to present sufficient evidence to show that the defendant purposefully availed itself of the benefits and protections of California law. The defendant's placement of its product into the stream of commerce alone is not enough to establish minimum contacts. The defendant has not advertised or distributed its product to customers in California, and it does not have any registered users in California.

The judge grants the defendant's motion to quash service of summons and sets aside the default judgment against the defendant. The judge finds that the defendant lacks the necessary minimum contacts with California to support personal jurisdiction.
