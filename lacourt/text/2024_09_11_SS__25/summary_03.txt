Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The hearing on the Petition to Approve Minor's Compromise filed on behalf of minor claimant Daniel Curl is continued to October 23, 2024, at 10:00 a.m. in Department 25 at the Spring Street Courthouse. The petitioner, Kentasha Holley, is ordered to file supplemental papers addressing the deficiencies noted in the petition, including the use of outdated Judicial Council forms, incomplete information, and lack of proof of the negotiated reduction in the medical lien. Failure to do so may result in the petition being placed off calendar or denied. The court also notes that the attorney's fees requested are not shown to be reasonable and that the petitioner has not completed certain sections of the petition.
