ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
            On
March 28, 2024, Plaintiff Daniel Curl, by and through his guardian ad litem Kentasha
Holley, filed an action against Defendant Mariah Hall arising out of an alleged
motor vehicle accident that occurred on February 14, 2023.  On May 1, 2024, Kentasha Holley was appointed
guardian ad litem for Plaintiff Daniel Curl.
 
            On
July 17, 2024, Petitioner Kentasha Holley (“Petitioner” or “Holley”) filed the
instant Petition to Approve Compromise of Disputed Claim on behalf of minor
Claimant Daniel Curl (“Petition”).
 
            No
opposition has been filed.
 
II.                
Legal
Standard
 
            Court approval is required
for all settlements of a minor’s claim. (Prob. Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; CCP § 372.) “‘[W]ithout trial
court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the settlement
cannot be valid.  [Citation.] [¶] Nor is
the settlement binding [on the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial
court.’” (Pearson v. Superior Court
(2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338.)  A
minor, like Claimant, “shall appear either by a guardian or conservator of the
estate or by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court in which the action or
proceeding is pending, or by a judge thereof, in each case.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 372, subd. (a)(1).) Alternatively, the petitioner may file a declaration
demonstrating that he or she has a right to compromise the minor’s claim under
California Probate Code section 3500. 
 
            Regarding the substance of the Petition, to obtain court
approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner must file a complete and “verified petition for
approval of the settlement and must disclose ‘all information that has any
bearing upon the reasonableness of the compromise.’ [Citations.]”  (Barnes
v. Western Heritage Ins. Co. (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 7.950.) (Italics added.) 
 
Under Probate Code § 3505, if a petition is unopposed,
the Court must issue a decision on the petition at the conclusion of the
hearing.

6.     
Counsel
Stephen P. Grayson’s declaration does not show that the attorney’s fees
requested are reasonable pursuant to CRC 7.955(b) .  (Pet. pp. 30-32, Attach 14a.)
