ANALYSIS:
 
I.                   
Background
 
On November 30,
2022, this Court entered as Judgment sister-state Judgment from the Agua Fria
Justice Court, Maricopa County, Arizona, in favor of Western American Loan,
Inc. (“Plaintiff” or “Creditor”) and against Albert Padilla and Doe Spouse
Padilla, a marital community (“Defendants” or “Debtors”).
 
Creditor filed a
Writ of Execution and Memorandum of Costs After Judgment, Acknowledgment of
Credit, and Declaration of Accrued Interest on August 2, 2023.
 
On July 15, 2024, Creditor filed the
instant Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs, requesting “an award of at least $6,825.31
in Attorneys’ Fees and Costs incurred post-judgment.”  (Mot. p. 1.)
No opposition has been filed.
 
II.                
Request for Judicial Notice
 
Judgment Creditor requests that the
Court take judicial notice of:
 
(1)  
Exhibit 1 –Judgment entered in the Agua Fria Justice
Court, County of Maricopa, State of Arizona, entitled Western American Loan,
Inc. v. Albert Padilla and Doe Spouse Padilla, Case No. CC2020-090838RC.
 
(2)  
Exhibit 2 - Notice of Entry of Judgment on Sister-State
Judgment entered in the instant action.
 
(RJN Exs. 1-2.)
 
Judgment Creditor’s request for
Judicial Notice is GRANTED.  (Evid.
Code., § 452, subds. (c), (d).)
 
III.             
Legal Standard
 
A prevailing
party is entitled to recover costs, including attorney’s fees, as a matter of
right.  (See Code Civ. Proc. §§
1032, subd. (a)(4), 1032, subd. (b), 1033.5.) 
Attorney’s
fees are allowable as costs when authorized by contract, statute, or law.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).) 
 
“The judgment creditor is entitled to the
reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a judgment.  Attorney’s fees incurred in enforcing a
judgment are not included in costs collectible under this title unless otherwise
provided by law.  Attorney’s fees
incurred in enforcing a judgment are included as costs collectible under this
title if the underlying judgment includes an award of attorney’s fees to the
judgment creditor pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (10) of subdivision
(a) of Section 1033.5.”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 685.040.)
 
“The judgment creditor may claim costs
authorized by Section 685.040 by noticed motion.  The motion shall be made before the judgment
is satisfied in full, but not later than two years after the costs have been
incurred.  The costs claimed under this
section may include, but are not limited to, costs that may be claimed under
Section 685.070 and costs incurred but not approved by the court or referee in
a proceeding under Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 708.010) of Division
2.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.080, subd. (a).)
 
“The notice of motion shall describe the
costs claimed, shall state their amount, and shall be supported by an affidavit
of a person who has knowledge of the facts stating that to the person’s best
knowledge and belief the costs are correct, are reasonable and necessary, and
have not been satisfied.  The notice of
motion shall be served on the judgment debtor. 
Service shall be made personally or by mail.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 685.080, subd. (b).)
 
The calculation of
attorney’s fees in California begins with the “lodestar” method – multiplying
the number of hours reasonably expended by the reasonable hourly rate.  A computation of time spent on a case and the
reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an
appropriate attorneys’ fee award.  The
lodestar figure may then be adjusted, based on factors specific to the case, in
order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided.  (Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49.)  Such an approach anchors the trial court’s
analysis to an objective determination of the value of the attorney’s services,
ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary.  (Ibid.
at p. 48, fn. 23.)  After the trial court
has performed the lodestar calculations, it shall consider whether the total
award so calculated under all of the circumstances of the case is more than a
reasonable amount and, if so, shall reduce the section 1717 award so that it is
a reasonable figure.  (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095-1096.)
 
As explained in Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc.:
 
“[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for comparable legal services in the
community; it may be adjusted by the court based on factors including, as
relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2)
the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of
the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award. [Citation.]  The
purpose of such adjustment is to fix a fee at the fair market value for the
particular action. In effect, the court determines, retrospectively, whether
the litigation involved a contingent risk or required extraordinary legal skill
justifying augmentation of the unadorned lodestar in order to approximate the
fair market rate for such services. . . . This approach anchors the trial
court's analysis to an objective determination of the value of the attorney's
services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary.” [Internal
citations and internal quotation marks omitted.]
 
((2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)  “It is well established that the determination
of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of
the trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence of an abuse
of discretion.  [Citations.]  The value of legal services performed in a
case is a matter in which the trial court has its own expertise. . . . The
trial court makes its determination after consideration of a number of factors,
including the nature of the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved,
the skill required in its handling, the skill employed, the attention given,
the success or failure, and other circumstances in the case.  [Citations.]” 
(Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64
Cal.App.3d 618, 623-624.)
 
No specific findings reflecting the
court’s calculations are required.  The
record need only show that the attorney fees were awarded according to the
“lodestar” or “touchstone” approach.  The
court’s focus in evaluating the facts should be to provide a fee award
reasonably designed to completely compensate attorneys for the services
provided.  The starting point for this
determination is the attorney’s time records.  (Horsford
v. Board of Trustees of Calif. State Univ. (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359,
395-397 [verified time records entitled to credence absent clear indication
they are erroneous].)  However,
California case law permits fee awards in the absence of detailed time sheets.
(Sommers v. Erb (1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1644, 1651; Dunk v. Ford Motor Co. (1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1794, 1810; Nightingale v. Hyundai Motor America
(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 99, 103.)  An
experienced trial judge is in a position to assess the value of the
professional services rendered in his or her court.  (Ibid.;
Serrano, 20 Cal.3d 25 at 49.)
 
IV.             
Discussion 
 
A.    
Proof of Service
 
Plaintiff/Creditor has filed Proof
of Service indicating that Defendants/Debtors were served with the moving
papers by mail on July 15, 2024.  (7-15-24
Proof of Service.)  The Court finds that service
was proper.
 
B.    
Attorney’s Fees
 
Plaintiff/Creditor
seeks “an award of at least $6,825.31 in Attorneys’ Fees and Costs incurred
post-judgment.”  (Mot. p. 1.)  Plaintiff/Creditor argues that as part of the
Arizona judgment, Plaintiff is entitled to “all costs and reasonable attorney
fees incurred by Plaintiff after submission of this judgment for entry by the
Court in collecting the amounts listed in this Judgment."  (Id. at pp. 3-4; RJN, Ex. 1.)
 
The
Court finds that Creditor is entitled to attorney’s fees pursuant to the sister-state
Judgment, which awarded attorney’s fees and costs, and Code of Civil Procedure
section 685.040.
 
Creditor
supports its request with a declaration of its counsel.  (See Baillio Decl.)  Creditor states that its Motion is timely
because the Judgment has not been satisfied. 
(Baillio Decl. ¶ 4.)  Furthermore,
Creditor is requesting fees and costs incurred between July 18, 2022, and July
2, 2024.  (Id. at ¶ 13.)
 
Creditor
argues that the attorney’s fees and costs requested are “reasonable and
necessary” since the attorneys in this case provided extensive legal services
to pursue collection of the Judgment. 
(Mot. pp. 5-6.)  Creditor’s attorneys
had to “(i) domesticate the Arizona Judgment to California; (ii) attempt [to] serve
notice of entry of judgment, (iii) draft an application for service by
publication and publish notice in a legal newspaper; (iv) obtain a writ of
execution and a wage garnishment, (v) search for assets owned by Debtors to use
to satisfy judgment; (vii) draft memorandum of costs after judgment; and (viii)
draft this Motion.”  (Baillio Decl. ¶ 5.)
 
Counsel
Baillio served as counsel on this matter and his billing rate was $325.00 per
hour before January 1, 2023, and $375.00 per hour, after.  (Baillio Decl. ¶ 6.)  These rates are commensurate with those of
other attorneys with similar levels of experience and specialization in
Maricopa County.  (Id. at ¶ 8.)  Between July 18, 2022, and July 2, 2024,
Counsel Baillio spent 7.4 hours in collection efforts and charged four flat
fees of $450 for obtaining writs of execution and earnings withholding
orders.  (Id. at ¶ 7.)  The firm’s legal support team was also
critical to the case and spent a total of 2 hours to support the collection
efforts, at a billing rate of $150 per hour, and 1 hour at a billing rate of
$175 per hour.  (Id. at ¶¶ 9-11.)  Moreover, Counsel Baillio spent 1.5 hours, at
a rate of $375.00 per hour, drafting the instant Motion and accompanying papers
and anticipates spending another 0.4 hours to attend the hearing on the Motion,
plus $61.65 in motion filing fees.  (Id.
at ¶ 12.)  In total, Creditor requests $4,862.50
in attorney’s fees, expended between July 18, 2022, and July 2, 2024.  (Id. at ¶ 13.)  Counsel Baillio has attached an itemized billing
statement demonstrating the legal work performed for Creditor in pursuit of
collecting the Judgment.  (Id. at
¶ 14, Ex. A.)
 
The
Court reviews counsel’s billing statement for tasks billed between July 18,
2022, and July 2, 2024, in pursuit of enforcing the Judgment.  The Court considers factors such as counsel’s
expertise, number of hours expended on each task, and whether each task was
expended in pursuit of the Judgment.  The
Court finds that Creditor’s request for $4,862.50 is slightly excessive.  For example, the instant Motion, regularly
drafted by Counsel, does not warrant 1.5 hours of attorney time at a billing
rate of $375.00.
 
For
the foregoing reasons, the Court finds a reduced amount of $4,000.00 in
attorney’s fees to be reasonable.
 
C.    
Costs
 
Code
of Civil Procedure § 685.070, subdivision (b), states: “Before the judgment is
fully satisfied but not later than two years after the costs have been
incurred, the judgment creditor claiming costs under this section shall file a
memorandum of costs with the court clerk and serve a copy on the judgment
debtor. Service shall be made personally or by mail. The memorandum of costs
shall be executed under oath by a person who has knowledge of the facts and
shall state that to the person's best knowledge and belief the costs are
correct, are reasonable and necessary, and have not been satisfied.”
 
Code
of Civil Procedure 685.080, subdivision (b), requires that: “The notice of
motion shall describe the costs claimed, shall state their amount, and shall be
supported by an affidavit of a person who has knowledge of the facts stating
that to the person's best knowledge and belief the costs are correct, are
reasonable and necessary, and have not been satisfied. The notice of motion
shall be served on the judgment debtor. Service shall be made personally or by
mail.”
 
Creditor
requests costs in the amount of $1,962.81 through a noticed motion.  The request includes “electronic monitoring
fees, filing fees, service fees, sheriff's fees, fees for writs of execution
and wage garnishment orders, and background research fees.”  (Mot. p. 7; Baillio Decl. ¶ 16, Ex. A.)  
 
The
Court finds Creditor’s request for costs to be reasonable and grants the
request in the amount of $1,962.81.
 
 
V.               
Conclusion & Order
 
For the foregoing reasons,
 
Plaintiff/Creditor Western American
Loan, Inc. Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs is GRANTED for attorney’s fees
in the amount of $4,000.00 and costs in the amount of $1,962.81 for a TOTAL of
$5,962.81.
 
Moving party is
ordered to give notice.
