MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL
Hearing Date: 10/30/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV17883 ANN DEFUSCO vs
CITY OF COVINA
Moving Party: Defendant City of Covina
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: DENIED; THE COURT WILL, HOWEVER,
DISCUSS A POTENTIAL BRIEF CONTINUANCE IN LIGHT OF THE PENDING MSJ
 
On June 1, 2022,
Plaintiff filed the present trip-and-fall case. Trial is currently set for
November 27, 2024. On October 17, 2024, the Court heard Defendant City of
Covina’s Ex Parte Application and held that “The parties knew the trial date
and failed to attend mediation in a timely manner given that trial date. That
is not good cause. … a substitution of counsel is not generally a basis for a
continuance -- parties substitute or change counsel subject to the pending
dates. Simply, the parties have had more than 2 years to be ready for trial.
They have already continued the matter. They should be ready to try the case,
as the CCP advises that trial dates are to be treated as ‘firm’.”
The current motion does
not present any new arguments beyond those raised in the ex parte
application. Both filings are substantively identical, relying on the same
rationale for a continuance: a stipulated trial continuance, additional time
for mediation, and recent substitution of counsel. These points were already
addressed in the Court’s order on Defendant's ex parte application, in
which the Court found no good cause. The Court is responsible for ensuring that
civil cases conclude within two years (see CRC 2.2). This case, a
straightforward slip-and-fall incident, has been pending for over two years.
The parties were aware of the trial date and did not pursue mediation promptly
in light of that timeline. Furthermore, parties who substitute or change
counsel are subject to existing deadlines. The Court does not find good cause
to continue the trial; therefore, the motion is denied.  
That all said, the
Court will discuss with the parties the Court’s willingness to BRIEFLY continue
the matter in light of the fact that moving party’s MSJ is pending decision.
