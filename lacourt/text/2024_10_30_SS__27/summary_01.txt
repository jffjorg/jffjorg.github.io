And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant City of Covina's motion to continue the trial, which is currently set for November 27, 2024. The judge found that the parties had over two years to prepare for trial and had already continued the matter once before. The judge also noted that the parties failed to attend mediation in a timely manner, and that a substitution of counsel is not generally a basis for a continuance. However, the judge did express a willingness to briefly continue the matter in light of the fact that the defendant's motion for summary judgment (MSJ) is pending decision.
