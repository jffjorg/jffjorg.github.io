And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge granted in part the motion for summary adjudication filed by M. Arthur Gensler Jr. & Associates, Inc. (Gensler) against Bank of America and Jones Lang LaSalle (Cross Complainants). The judge found that Gensler has a duty to defend Cross Complainants against the breach of contract cause of action and declaratory relief cause of action, but did not meet its burden to demonstrate that there was no potential for coverage at the time of tender.

The judge also granted summary adjudication as to the causes of action for apportionment, equitable indemnity, and implied contractual indemnity, finding that Gensler has met its initial burden to demonstrate that it was not negligent in designing the curb where the alleged incident occurred.

The judge noted that Gensler's duty to defend is a continuing one, arising on tender of defense and lasting until the underlying lawsuit is concluded, or until it has been shown that there is no potential for coverage. The judge also noted that the duty to defend extends to all claims that, at the time of tender, allege facts potentially giving rise to a duty of indemnity, unless otherwise specified in the indemnity agreement.
