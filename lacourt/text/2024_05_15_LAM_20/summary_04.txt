Here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion for summary judgment, which argued that the plaintiff lacked standing to bring the lawsuit. The plaintiff, Diego Mejia Duarte, filed a complaint alleging violations of the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) and seeking to include certain benefits in his regular rate of pay. The defendant, Apple, Inc., argued that these benefits were not included in the regular rate of pay as a matter of law. The court found that there were triable issues of material fact regarding the plaintiff's standing, and therefore denied the motion for summary judgment. The court also granted the plaintiff's request for judicial notice and overruled the defendant's objections.
