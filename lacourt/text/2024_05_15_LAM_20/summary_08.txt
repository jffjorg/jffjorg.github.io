And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a lawsuit filed by Jane Doe against LAUSD and Does 1-60. The plaintiff alleges childhood sexual abuse and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The defendant, LAUSD, has moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the plaintiff's claims rely on A.B. 218's retroactive elimination of the government claims requirement, which is an unconstitutional gift of public funds. The court has determined that the subpoenas issued to medical providers are overbroad and seeks to quash them. The court has also determined that A.B. 218 is constitutional and grants the motion to quash the subpoenas. The court finds that the public purpose served by A.B. 218 outweighs any potential private benefits.
