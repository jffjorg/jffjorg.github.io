 On December 13, 2023, Plaintiffs Martin L. Waterman and the Law Offices of Waterman & Harris filed the operative Complaint asserting a claim for equitable indemnity and contribution.  Defendants Leslie Harris and Michelle Silver, personal representatives of The Estate of Howard Harris, now demur to the Complaint for failure to state sufficient facts.  Because there is no opposition, the subject causes of action are deemed abandoned.  (Herzberg v. County of Plumas (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1, 20.)  The Demurrer is sustained, without leave to amend.  The Request for Judicial Notice is granted.Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
