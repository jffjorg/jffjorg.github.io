The court has tentatively ruled to continue the motion for attorney fees to allow for an in-camera review of the unredacted billing records. The court has not yet determined the reasonableness of the hourly rates claimed or the hours billed, as the billing records are heavily redacted. The court will require the plaintiffs to produce the unredacted billing records for review.
