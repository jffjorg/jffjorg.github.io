  - "An order compelling disclosure must be narrowly tailored so as not to infringe on constitutional rights. Speculation that an answer may recover something helpful does not meet that threshold burden." (Fults v. Superior Court (1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 899)
  - "An implicit waiver of a party's constitutional rights encompasses 'only discovery directly relevant to the plaintiff's claim and essential to the fair resolution of the lawsuit.'" (Davis v. Superior Court (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1008)
```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to quash seven deposition subpoenas issued by the defendant for medical records and billing information. The Judge found that the plaintiff has a protected right to privacy in his medical records, and that the defendant's request for disclosure was too broad and speculative. The Judge also found that the plaintiff has waived his right to seek damages for physical injuries, and therefore the defendant's request for disclosure was not justified. The Judge ordered that the defendant may re-serve the subpoenas with a narrower scope, consistent with the order.
