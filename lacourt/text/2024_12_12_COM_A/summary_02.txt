And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has denied Quality Loan Service Corp.'s (Petitioner's) motion to deposit surplus funds with the court. The surplus funds resulted from the sale of a property at a foreclosure sale, and Petitioner claims it cannot determine how the funds should be distributed. Petitioner mailed notice to all claimants of record, but only one claimant, Asset Recovery, Inc., has filed a claim. The judge finds that Petitioner did not adequately mail proof of service to the prior owners of the property, Lula Russell and Dillard L. Russell. As a result, the court denies Petitioner's motion and orders it to give notice.
