MOTION
            Attorney
Laurie M. Cortez of Emilio Law Group, APC (“Counsel”) moves to be relieved as
counsel for Defendant Masoud Malek, M.D. (“Defendant”).  Defendant has not opposed the motion.
ANALYSIS
Counsel has filed
forms MC-051 and MC-052 and has lodged with the court a copy of the proposed
order on form MC-053, as required.  (Cal
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.)  The basis
for the motion is that the professional relationship between Counsel and Defendant
has broken down.  This is a valid reason
for withdrawal.  Accordingly, the motion
is granted. 
Counsel should
note the order will become effective upon the filing of proof of service on Defendant
of the signed order, and she will remain the attorney of record until she files
with the court proof of service of the signed order.  Counsel is to serve a copy of the signed
order (form MC-053) on Defendant within 10 days and file proof of service
thereof.
Counsel is ordered
to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
