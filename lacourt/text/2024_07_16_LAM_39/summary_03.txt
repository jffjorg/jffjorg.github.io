And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant, Crystal Bergstrom, in her motion to quash service of summons. The plaintiffs, Robert Lindholm and Carolyn Lindholm, oppose the motion. The judge finds that the proof of service of summons does not indicate that the process server was a California registered process server, and therefore the presumption of service under Evidence Code section 647 does not apply. The defendant's declaration states that no one served her, and there is no record of a process server entering her gated community on the date of service. The plaintiffs have not provided sufficient evidence to prove that they properly served the defendant. The judge grants the motion to quash and orders the defendant to provide notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
