MOVING PARTIES


Defendant Crystal Bergstrom




OPPOSING PARTY


Plaintiffs
  Robert Lindholm and Carolyn Lindholm



 
BACKGROUND
Defendant Crystal
Bergstrom (“Defendant”) moves to quash service of summons.  Plaintiffs Robert Lindholm and Carolyn
Lindholm (“Lindholm”)  (collectively, “Plaintiffs”)
oppose the motion.  
ANALYSIS
“A defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time
to plead or within any further time that the court may for good cause allow,
may serve and file a notice of motion . . . [t]o quash service of summons on
the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd.
(a)(1).)  “In the absence of a voluntary
submission to the authority of the court, compliance with the statutes
governing service of process is essential to establish that court's personal
jurisdiction over a defendant.”  (Dill
v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1439.)  
Plaintiffs filed a proof of service of summons, which
reflects Plaintiffs served Defendant by personal service on March 1, 2024 at
8:05 a.m., at 47 Marseille in Laguna Niguel. 
(See Proof of Service of Summons, filed May 17, 2024.)  However, the proof of service does not
indicate the person who made the service was a California registered process
server.  Therefore, the presumption,
pursuant to Evidence Code section 647, service was effectuated does not apply
in this instance.  
Defendant provides her own declaration.  She states no one served her, and there is no
record of a process server entering her gated community on March 1, 2024.  (See Declaration of Crystal Bergstrom.)  As such, especially given the presumption of
service under Evidence Code section 647 has not attached, Plaintiffs have the
burden to prove Plaintiffs properly served Defendant.  (Summers v. McClanahan (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th
403, 413.)
In opposition, Plaintiffs have submitted Lindblom’s declaration.  Lindblom, who is an attorney representing
Plaintiffs in this action, declares the attorney service informed her it could
enter the gated community in which Defendant resides by following a resident
through the gate.  (See Declaration of
Carolyn Lindholm.)  If offered for the
truth of the matter asserted, this is hearsay, and inadmissible.  (Evid. Code, § 1200.)  Further, this testimony
is irrelevant to the issue of whether the process server, on Plaintiffs behalf,
did in fact serve Defendant on March 1, 2015.  Therefore, Plaintiffs have not satisfied their
burden of demonstrating Defendant had been served.  Accordingly, the motion to quash is granted.
Defendant is ordered to provide notice of
this order and to file proof of service of same.
