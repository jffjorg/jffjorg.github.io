And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a motion by cross-complainant Marcus Rosner to set aside the dismissal of his cross-complaint and enter default judgment against cross-defendants Paolo Mazoli and Kia Zoghi. The cross-complaint was filed as a result of a default judgment entered against Mazoli and Zoghi. Rosner's counsel missed two separate hearings due to errors in scheduling software and failure to receive notice. The judge concludes that Rosner is not entitled to mandatory relief under Code of Civil Procedure §473(b) because the dismissal was for failure to prosecute, which is not a procedural equivalent to a default. The judge also concludes that Rosner is not entitled to discretionary relief because the mistakes made by Rosner's counsel were not reasonable and did not cause the default. Therefore, the judge grants the motion to set aside the dismissal and sets a status conference re default judgments on December 12, 2024 at 9:00 a.m.
