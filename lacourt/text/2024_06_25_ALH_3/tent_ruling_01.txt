On January 22, 2024, plaintiff
Taichandra Fyeldees (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Allied Pacific IPA
and Does 1 to 10. Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on February 16, 2024, correctly
naming Allied Physicians of California dba Allied Pacific IPA (“Defendant”) and
Does 1 to 10. A proof of service filed on March 25, 2024, shows that Defendant
was personally served through its registered agent for service of process on
February 28, 2024. 
On April 8, 2024, default was entered
against Defendant. On May 2, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to set aside and
vacate the entry of default. Defendant also requests the Court judicially
notice records from a related case filed by Plaintiff against Defendant,
captioned Taichandra Fyeldees v. Allied Pacific IPA, et al. (Case No.
22STCV18790). The request is GRANTED. 
          Defendant states
in its brief that it did not provide the complaint to its counsel, W&D Law,
LLP, until after Plaintiff requested the entry of default, and its failure to
do so was based on inadvertence and excusable neglect. (Motion, p. 4.) A judge
may grant relief from default or a default judgment on the ground of the
defendant's excusable neglect if the defendant shows a reasonable excuse for
the default. (Jackson v Bank of America (1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 55, 58.) The
defendant has the burden of proving excusable neglect by a preponderance of the
evidence. (Bonzer v City of Huntington Park (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1474,
1478.) 
          Defendant’s
counsel, Anthony D. Platt, declares that his client did not provide the
complaint until after Plaintiff requested the entry of default. (Motion, Platt
Decl. ¶ 3.) Mr. Platt refers generally to “inadvertent and excusable neglect”
but there is no declaration from Defendant’s corporate representative stating
any facts demonstrating excusable neglect. Accordingly, the motion to set aside
is DENIED without prejudice.
