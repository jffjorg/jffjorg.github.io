And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Allied Pacific IPA (Defendant) to set aside a default entered on April 8, 2024. The default was entered after Plaintiff Taichandra Fyeldees filed a complaint on January 22, 2024, and Defendant was personally served on February 28, 2024. Defendant claims that it did not provide the complaint to its counsel, W&D Law, LLP, until after Plaintiff requested the entry of default, and that this failure was due to excusable neglect. The judge has denied the motion without prejudice, finding that Defendant has not provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate excusable neglect. The judge grants Defendant's request to judicially notice records from a related case filed by Plaintiff against Defendant. The parties are advised to submit on the tentative ruling and indicate their intentions to do so by email to the court.
