And here is the summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has ruled on the Defendants' demurrer to the Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (SAC). The demurrer is sustained without leave to amend as to the first cause of action against Defendant Naum for breach of contract, as the claim is long since time-barred. The Judge finds that the allegation that Naum paid partial payments on the contract in recent years does not revive the claim. The demurrer is also sustained without leave to amend as to the second cause of action against Naum for common counts, as that claim stands or falls with the breach of contract claim.

However, the demurrer is overruled as to the third cause of action against all Defendants for fraudulent transfer, as the claim is not time-barred from the face of the SAC. The Judge disagrees with the Defendants' contention that the SAC contains insufficient allegations to support the fraudulent transfer claim, finding that it does.

The demurrer is also overruled as to the fourth cause of action for fraud as it relates to Naum, as the Judge finds that the fraud claim is not time-barred on the face of the SAC and the allegations in the SAC satisfy the heightened pleading standard for fraud as to Naum. However, the demurrer is sustained with leave to amend as to the fraud claim as it relates to all of the other Defendants, as the SAC contains no allegations to support a fraud claim against them.
