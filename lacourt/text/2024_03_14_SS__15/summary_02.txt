And here is a summary in English text of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has ruled on two motions to quash subpoenas and one motion to compel filed by various defendants in a case involving Plaintiff's claims for damages. The Judge denied most of the motions to quash subpoenas, finding that they were too broad and sought privileged information, such as tax returns. The Judge granted one motion to quash in part, finding that Plaintiff had waived his privacy rights in certain financial documents by claiming lost income. The Judge denied a motion to compel filed by Familian Corp, finding that it was defective and did not provide sufficient notice. The Judge ordered the production of certain documents by March 22, 2024.
