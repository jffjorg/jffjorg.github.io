And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to quash service of summons filed by Dr. Ing. h.c.F Porsche AG. The plaintiff had previously dismissed the defendant without prejudice due to the upcoming preference trial date. The plaintiff then attempted to serve the defendant again, but this attempt is invalid because the plaintiff must first file a motion to amend the complaint to name the defendant. Additionally, the preference statute does not allow for the service of a defendant after a preference trial has been set. Finally, the judge finds that the six-week timeframe before the continued preference trial is insufficient for the defendant to take discovery, file a motion for summary judgment, and prepare for trial.
