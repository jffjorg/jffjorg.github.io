**Tentative Ruling**

The Court has reviewed the motions for summary adjudication and to compel deposition attendance filed by the defendants, Onni Contracting (California), Inc. and RLI Insurance Company. The Plaintiff, Precision Construction Group, Inc., seeks damages against Onni for alleged breach of subcontract and failure to pay for products provided.

The Court finds that the motion for summary adjudication is denied as the proposed issues do not completely dispose of the causes of action or claims for damages. The Court also finds that the motion to compel deposition attendance is denied as the defendant's request is not supported by good cause.

The Court concludes that the motions are denied due to the existence of triable issues of fact regarding material cost increases, the validity of the mechanics lien, and the admissibility of parol evidence to interpret contract language.
