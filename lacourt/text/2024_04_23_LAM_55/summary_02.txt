And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the motions filed by the parties in this case. The plaintiffs seek to amend their original complaint to add new claims and allegations related to the development of the Century Plaza Hotel. The defendants oppose this motion, arguing that the delay in bringing the motion is inexcusable and that the additional claims will cause undue prejudice. The court disagrees, finding that the delay is reasonable and that the proposed amendments relate to the same general facts as the original complaint.

The court has also considered the defendants' motion to seal confidential records. The defendants have argued that these records contain trade secrets and other confidential information, and the court has found that a compelling, overriding interest exists in sealing these records.

Based on these findings, the court grants the plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint and orders them to file and serve the amended complaint within 14 days. The court also grants the defendants' motion to seal confidential records.

This tentative ruling will be considered at the hearing on April 23, 2024.
