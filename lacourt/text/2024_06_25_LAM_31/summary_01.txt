And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Seed Textile, Inc. v. J & Dong Fashion, Inc. The case is about a motion to quash a subpoena served on Bank of America for records related to J&D's bank accounts. The defendant, Hee Yeon Dong, argues that the subpoena is burdensome and infringes upon her right to financial privacy. The judge finds that the motion is without merit and denies the motion to quash. The judge also finds that the subpoena is relevant to the plaintiff's claims and that the defendant's arguments lack merit.

The judge also imposes sanctions against the defendant and her counsel of record in the sum of $450, to be paid to the plaintiff. The sanctions are imposed because the court finds that the defendant and her counsel engaged in discovery abuse.
