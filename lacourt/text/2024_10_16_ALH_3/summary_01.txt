And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of CAFE ON LEMON, INC. (Plaintiff) vs. LOUIS PETRIE SEPARATE PROPERTY TRUST, et al. (Defendant). The Defendant, as Trustee of the Louis Petrie Separate Property Trust, has moved for an order compelling the Plaintiff to comply with the Court's August 13, 2024, Order and serve responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One. The Defendant has also requested $1,900 in monetary sanctions against the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff opposes the motion and argues that its counsel's illness was the reason for the failure to comply with the Court's order.

The Judge has granted the Defendant's motion for sanctions and has imposed sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,425. The Court has awarded this amount based on 3 hours of defense counsel's hourly rate of $475, to be paid within 20 days of the date of the order. The Judge's ruling is based on the Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290(c), which provides that the Court may impose a monetary sanction if a party fails to obey an answer compelling responses to interrogatories.

The Judge's ruling is tentative, and the parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court indicating their intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided on the court website. If the Court does not receive emails from the parties indicating submission on this tentative ruling and there are no appearances at the hearing, the Court may, at its discretion, adopt the tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
