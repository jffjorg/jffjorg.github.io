      CASE NO.: 24NNCV02184
 
[TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE: MOTION TO BE RELIEVED 
 
Dept.
  3
8:30
  a.m.
October
   16, 2024




 


 


 



 
Jose
 Alfonso Ramirez-Gomez, of Jacoby & Meyers Attorneys LLP, seeks to
be relieved as counsel of record for plaintiff
 Kathy Cruz (“Plaintiff”) on grounds that there has
 been a breakdown in communication. Absent a showing of resulting
prejudice, an attorney’s request for withdrawal should be granted. (People
v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 406.) 
The Court notes that trial in this
matter is not yet set and no prejudice will result from granting this motion. However,
the proposed order fails to include Plaintiff’s phone number in Item 6.
Therefore, the hearing is continued to October 29, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in
Department 3 so that counsel may submit a revised proposed order. The revised
proposed order should also check Item 5a and be filed no later than 5 court
days before the date of the hearing. 
Moving party to give notice.
 
Dated
this 16th
day of October 2024
