And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Elijah Carder vs. T-MOBILE USA, INC., et al. The Court has sustained Defendant's demurrer to the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) without leave to amend, and the motion to strike is moot. The Court finds that Plaintiff's claims are preempted by federal law because they are based on alleged health effects from radiofrequency levels that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has already determined to be safe. The Court has previously ruled that if Plaintiff is contending that the radiation emitted is "excessive" despite being within the FCC's limits, then Plaintiff's claims are preempted. The Court notes that Plaintiff has not amended his complaint to add that the alleged emissions exceeded the limits established by the FCC, and therefore, Plaintiff's claims are preempted.
