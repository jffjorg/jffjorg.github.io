Defendant Dilys Jones (“Defendant”), as
Trustee of the Louis Petrie Separate Property Trust, moves for an order
compelling Plaintiff Café on Lemon, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) to comply with the
Court’s August 13, 2024, Order (“August 13 Order”) and serve responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One. Defendant also seeks $1,900 in monetary sanctions
against Plaintiff. 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290(c)
provides that the Court may impose a monetary sanction if party fails to obey
an answer compelling responses to interrogatories. 
Plaintiff opposes the motion and argues
that any failure to comply with the Court’s order was due to its counsel’s illness.
Counsel Dieter Zacher declares that he was “deathly ill from sepsis and a
bacterial infection and could not complete discovery or respond to the
demurrers or discovery responses timely in this case.” (Opp., Zacher Decl., ¶
2.) 
In its reply brief, Defendant points
out that counsel’s declaration is identical to the one filed three months ago
on July 19, 2024. Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s counsel has had ample time since
July 2024 for his condition to improve and if not, to hire other counsel to
assist with the case. The Court agrees. Plaintiff fails to provide any
justification for disobeying the Court’s August 13 Order.
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for
sanctions is GRANTED and the Court imposes sanctions in the reduced amount of $1,425
consisting of 3 hours at defense counsel’s hourly rate of $475, to be paid
within 20 days of the date of this Order. 
Dated
this 16th
day of October, 2024
