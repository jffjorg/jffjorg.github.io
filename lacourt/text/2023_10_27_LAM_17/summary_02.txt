And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling is a continuation of the court's consideration of Chabad of Ojai Valley's (COV) motion to vacate the judgment and dismiss the case due to the failure to join an indispensable party. The case arises from a stipulated judgment entered on February 6, 2023, which struck a $75,000 charitable gift to COV by the Third Amendment to the Paris Family Trust.

The court finds that supplemental briefing is necessary to address several issues. First, the court must determine whether COV can file a proposed pleading if the judgment is set aside. Second, the court must consider COV's argument that the judgment is void. Third, the court must address COV's claim that the probate court has exclusive jurisdiction over this case.

The court orders that both parties submit further briefing clarifying whether or not this case can proceed in probate, whether or not COV had notice of the probate claim, and why COV did not file any pleadings or seek any relief if it did. The court also requests that Plaintiff clarify why he notified COV of its impacted rights as part of the probate process, but did not notify COV that he was filing this action.

The court's tentative ruling is a continuation of the proceedings, and the parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court by 4 p.m. the day prior. If all parties to a motion submit, the court will adopt this tentative as the final order.
