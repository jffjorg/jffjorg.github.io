Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for a protective order, which seeks to prevent the defendant from possessing a copy of John Doe's video deposition. The plaintiff argues that John Doe is entitled to accommodation under California Rules of Court (CRC) rule 1.100 and California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section 2025.420. The court has reviewed the unredacted filings and finds good cause to grant the protective order based on John Doe's privacy concerns and medical condition. The court notes that the defendant will not be prejudiced by this order and that the plaintiff does not object to the defendant's counsel possessing a copy of the video deposition. The protective order will prevent the defendant from publicly disclosing John Doe's personal identifying information or likeness.
