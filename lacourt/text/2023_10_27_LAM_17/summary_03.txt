And here is a summary in English text:

Judge Jon R. Takasigi has issued a tentative ruling denying plaintiff Michael Chang's motion for a new trial. Chang filed a lawsuit against Francis Seongjin Ryu alleging extortion, and the jury awarded no damages. Chang argued that the court erred in denying his proposed jury instruction on nominal damages, granting Defendant's Motions in Limine excluding reference to attorneys' fees, and failing to award emotional distress damages. The court found that Chang failed to present authority to support his claims and that the jury's verdict was supported by substantial evidence. The court also found that Defendant's closing statement did not prejudice the jury's verdict. The motion for new trial is denied.
