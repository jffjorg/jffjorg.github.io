And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling on a motion to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Jesus Cuevas Hernandez and a request for monetary sanctions. The defendant, J.B. Hunt Transport, Inc., seeks to compel the deposition because Plaintiff failed to appear for multiple scheduled depositions. The defendant also seeks monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,687.75, which represents the cost of the court reporter, videographer, and Spanish interpreter.

The judge notes that Plaintiff's counsel failed to appear for multiple scheduled depositions and cancelled the depositions at the last minute, causing unnecessary delays and expenses. The judge finds that Plaintiff or Plaintiff's counsel did not act with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of a sanction unjust.

The judge denies the motion to compel the deposition as moot because the deposition was taken on August 27, 2024. However, the judge grants monetary sanctions in the amount of $450 to counsel for Defendant, which represents 2 hours of attorney time to prepare the motion. The judge orders Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel to pay the sanctions within 30 days.
