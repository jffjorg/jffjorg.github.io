And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of Defendant Justin Vonhecht's motion for terminating sanctions against Plaintiffs Ingrid Finicle and Alfred Profeet. The motion was granted because the Plaintiffs failed to comply with the Court's discovery orders, including requests for production, interrogatories, and depositions. The Court found that monetary sanctions imposed earlier were insufficient to induce compliance and that the Plaintiffs' failure to comply has negatively impacted the Defendant's ability to defend the case. The Court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint without prejudice, as well as dismissing the unnamed Doe defendants. The Court also ordered the Defendant to provide notice of the ruling and file a proof of service.
