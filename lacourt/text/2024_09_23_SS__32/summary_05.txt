And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Plaintiff Eduardo Hernandez, who is seeking relief from the waiver of his right to a jury trial. The Plaintiff filed a complaint on May 31, 2022, demanding a jury trial, but failed to pay the required $150 jury fee within the allotted 365 days. The fee was eventually paid on April 8, 2024, which waived the Plaintiff's right to a jury trial. However, the Plaintiff's counsel claims that the failure to pay the fee was inadvertent and that granting relief from the waiver would not cause prejudice to the Defendant. Since no opposition has been filed, the judge has granted the Plaintiff's motion for relief from the waiver. The judge has ordered the Plaintiff to provide notice of the ruling and file proof of service.
