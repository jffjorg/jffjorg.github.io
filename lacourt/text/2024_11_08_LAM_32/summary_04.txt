And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike punitive damages from the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Kane Handel, alleges that the defendant, 1706 North Stanley LLC, was negligent in failing to remedy slippery conditions on their property, causing Handel's slip and fall. However, the judge finds that the allegations do not demonstrate malicious conduct, oppression, or fraud, which are required to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge notes that while the defendant failed to remedy the issues before Handel's injury, this amounts to no more than negligence, which is insufficient to warrant punitive damages. The judge relies on prior case law, including Jackson v. Johnson, Nolin v. National Convenience Stores, Inc., and Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co., to support their decision.
