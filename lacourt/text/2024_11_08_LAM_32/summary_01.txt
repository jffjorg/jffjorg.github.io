And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is considering a motion filed by the County of Los Angeles (Defendant) to file a cross-complaint against Rinaldo Alberico (Plaintiff) for breach of contract. The Plaintiff had filed a lawsuit against the Defendant alleging discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and failure to prevent, and the parties had reached a settlement for $19,999 in mediation. However, the Plaintiff refused to sign a written agreement formalizing the settlement, and the Defendant filed a motion to enforce the settlement. The Court denied this motion, finding that there was no enforceable agreement under California Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.

The Defendant then filed the instant motion for leave to file a cross-complaint, which seeks to hold the Plaintiff accountable for not abiding by the terms of the settlement. The Judge has found good cause to allow the cross-complaint, as there is no indication of bad faith or prejudice to the Plaintiff. The Judge has granted the motion and has ordered that the cross-complaint will be tried first at the upcoming hearing on November 8, 2024.
