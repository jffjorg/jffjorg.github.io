And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the plaintiffs' motion to file a third amended complaint. The plaintiffs are seeking to add two new causes of action for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing to their original complaint. The judge has determined that there is good cause for the amendment, as the contract claims are based on the same facts as the existing causes of action and do not prejudice the defendants. The judge has also noted that the plaintiffs' counsel did not notice the absence of the contract claims before the trial preparation, and therefore, the amendment is necessary and proper to have all related causes of action before the court and jury. The trial date has been continued to May 27, 2025, to accommodate the amendment.
