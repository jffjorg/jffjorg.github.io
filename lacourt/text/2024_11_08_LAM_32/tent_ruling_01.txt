  Case No.:  22STCV26025
  Hearing Date:  November 8, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s motion for leave to file
  cross-complaint  




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On August 11, 2022, Plaintiff
Rinaldo Alberico filed this action against Defendant County of Los Angeles,
asserting causes of action for discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and
failure to prevent. Plaintiff alleges that he was fired after reporting
numerous instances of other deputies using racial slurs against him. 
            On April 25, 2024, the parties
attended mediation and reached a settlement for $19,999. (Megrabyan Decl. ¶ 2.)
That same day, the mediator sent an email to both parties with the terms of the
settlement, and both parties responded confirming the terms. (Id., ¶ 4,
Ex. 1, 2.) Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement on May 1, 2024. On May 15,
2024, defense counsel circulated a written agreement formalizing the terms
reached in mediation and requesting Plaintiff’s signature. (Id., ¶ 6,
Ex. 5.) On May 23, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel responded to the email, stating
that Plaintiff “wants to be reinstated to the Sheriff Department.”[1] (Id.,
¶ 7, Ex. 6.) Defense counsel responded that Plaintiff did not qualify for
reinstatement under Los Angeles County Code of Ordinances Section 17.01 and
that reinstatement was not a negotiated settlement term. (Id., ¶ 8, Ex.
6.) 
After Plaintiff refused to sign a
settlement agreement, Defendant filed a motion to enforce settlement. The Court
denied this motion on September 4, 2024, finding that there was no enforceable
agreement under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. However, the Court noted
that Defendant could file a cross-complaint for breach of the oral contract
formed in mediation.   
On September 25, 2024, Defendant filed the
instant motion for leave to file a cross-complaint. Plaintiff has not filed an
opposition.
LEGAL STANDARD
            Code
of Civil Procedure section 428.50 permits the filing of a cross-complaint as
follows:
 
“(a) A party shall file a cross-complaint against
any of the parties who filed the complaint or cross-complaint against him or
her before or at the same time as the answer to the complaint or
cross-complaint. 
 
(b) Any other cross-complaint may be filed at any
time before the court has set a date for trial. 
 
(c) A party shall obtain leave of court to file any
cross-complaint except one filed within the time specified in subdivision (a)
or (b). Leave may be granted in the interest of justice at any time during the
course of the action.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 428.50.) 
DISCUSSION
            Defendant
seeks to file a cross-complaint for breach of contract based on Plaintiff’s
failure to abide by the terms of the settlement reached in mediation. “The
statutory procedure for enforcing settlement agreements under section 664.6 is
not exclusive. Thus, even when the summary procedures of section 664.6 are not
available, a party can still seek to enforce a settlement agreement by, among
other things, prosecuting an action for breach of contract.” (Harris v.
Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 306.) Therefore, the
Court finds good cause to allow the cross-complaint. There is no indication of
bad faith or any prejudice to Plaintiff.
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s
motion for leave to file cross-complaint is GRANTED. 
            Trial
will be bifurcated, and the cross-complaint will be tried first.
