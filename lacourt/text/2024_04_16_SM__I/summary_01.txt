English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's motion for terminating sanctions against the defendants. The defendants have been found to have willfully ignored their discovery obligations, including failing to appear for depositions and failing to pay imposed sanctions. The court finds that the defendants' actions are not credible and that they are attempting to avoid their responsibilities. The court orders that the defendants' answers be stricken, and they are now in default. The court also sets aside the trial dates and orders a date for an ex parte application for default judgment.
