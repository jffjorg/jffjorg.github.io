And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses three issues: a case management conference (CMC), the status of the appraisal process, and the potential increase of the bond. The judge assumes that the motion to increase the bond is moot since no papers have been filed since February. The appraisal process should be allowed to conclude, but if no fees have been paid or can be refunded, the process should stop. The judge sets a trial date, noting that the case is almost three years old and will be placed on an accelerated calendar. The parties will be asked to provide their estimate of the trial duration.
