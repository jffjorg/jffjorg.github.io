 Case Number:  21SMCV01387    Hearing Date:   April 16, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for three things.  First is a CMC.  Second is to ascertain the status of the
appraisal process.  Third is to decide
whether to increase the bond.  The court
has received no papers since February.
 
Based on the lack of recent filings, the court assumes that
the motion to increase the bond is MOOT. 
If, at some future point, defendant believes that the bond must be
increased, defendant can bring a new motion. 
That said, to the extent that the appraisal process has started, the
court believes it should be allowed to conclude.  But if no fees have been paid or they can be
refunded, the process should stop.
 
That leaves the CMC. 
This case is already almost three years old.  The court will therefore set a trial
date.  Because the case is so old, the
court will need to set it on a more accelerated calendar than would normally be
the case.  The court will inquire of the
parties as to their views as to how long the case will take to try—start to
finish.
