 Case Number:  SC123657    Hearing Date:   April 16, 2024    Dept:  I The applications for an MJOP or OST filed by defendants are
DENIED.  They come way too late for the
court to consider them at this time or on shortened time.  The moving parties provide no explanation for
their delay in seeking this relief and the court can only conclude that the
reason for that silence is that the reason for this ex parte is tactical
more than anything else or to foreshadow an aspect of the hearing to be held on
Friday.
 
The court has some concern that this case is not ready for
trial at this time.  The court notes, for
example, that there was an updated exhibit list filed on 4/12/24 and another
one filed 4/15/24.  
 
The court will discuss trial readiness with the parties on
Friday along with Triurol’s ex parte application.
 
The court does not intend to hear argument on this matter
today.
