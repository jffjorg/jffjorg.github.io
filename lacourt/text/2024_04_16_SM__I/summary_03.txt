And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a deposition taken of a treating physician. The deposition was taken on an ex parte basis, meaning it was taken without notice to the opposing party. The doctor had initially attempted to be deposed earlier, but the deposition was rescheduled. The doctor has no objection to the deposition. The judge has determined that the deposition does not constitute expert testimony, as the doctor will not provide expert opinions. Given that discovery closed on December 8, 2023, the judge has ruled that the deposition was too late. Therefore, sanctions are denied.
