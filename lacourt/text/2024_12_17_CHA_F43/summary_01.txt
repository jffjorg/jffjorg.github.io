And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the parties' arguments and has made a tentative ruling in the matter of the motion to compel further responses to Defendant's Requests for Production, Set Two. The court finds that the parties have not conducted a meaningful meet and confer process, and therefore, the court will not decide the motion on the merits at this time.

Instead, the court orders the parties to meet and confer directly, not by email or letter, and to file a joint statement of the remaining issues. The joint statement should briefly describe the matters in dispute, followed by the parties' arguments.

The court also notes that there appears to be a dispute between the parties over the efforts to meet and confer, and that the parties have not presented evidence that they met and conferred telephonically or via video conference prior to Defendant filing this motion.

Finally, the court sets a hearing date to consider the parties' joint statement and to resolve the dispute.
