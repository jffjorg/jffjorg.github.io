SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
November 6, 2022, Atlas Builders & Development, Inc. (Atlas) and Michael E.
Pacheco and Michelle Pacheco (the Pachecos) entered into a Contract under which
Atlas would provide the Pachecos with architectural services.  On December 28, 2022, the parties executed a Change
Order that substantially expanded the scope of Atlas’s work and set the grand
total final cost to $156,120.00, which included Atlas receiving a profit of 18%
plus 6% overhead plus 6% general conditions. 
Atlas relied on the Change Order and purchased $43,682.87-worth of
materials for the project.  Around March and
April 2023, the Pachecos ceased communicating with Atlas, failed to go forward
with the constructions, and failed to compensate Atlas for its costs expended
and its lost profits.  
 
On
December 22, 2023, Atlas filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration
Association (AAA), pursuant to the arbitration provision in the original Contract.  Atlas filed and served its evidentiary brief
on the Pachecos, but the Pachecos never filed or served a response, and did not
attend the arbitration.  
 
On
July 3, 2024, the Arbitrator issued an arbitration award.  The Arbitrator found that the Pachecos
materially breached the Contract and awarded Atlas $71,784.47: $43,682.87 in
out-of pocket costs and expenses for materials purchased plus $28,101.60 in
lost profit.  The Arbitrator also ordered
the Pachecos to pay $925.00 in AAA administrative fees and $1,750.00 for the
Arbitrator’s compensation.  
 
On
September 30, 2024, Atlas filed this petition to confirm the arbitration award
and judgment.  Attached to the petition
is the Contract, Arbitration Provision, and the Arbitration Award.  The Pachecos do not oppose the petition. 
 
ANALYSIS
“Any
party to an arbitration in which an award has been made may petition the court
to confirm, correct or vacate the award.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.)  The petition must state the substance, or
attach copies of the arbitration agreement, the award, and any written opinion.
 (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.)  The petitioner must serve the petition between
10 days and 4 years from the date the award was served on the petitioner.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.)  The other party may respond to the petition.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.2.) 
 
“If
a petition or response under this chapter is duly served and filed, the court
shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered in this state or another
state, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and
confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.)  The court may
not vacate or correct an award unless a petition or response requesting that
the award be vacated or corrected has been duly served and filed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1286.4 &
1286.8.)  “Once a petition to confirm an award is filed, the superior
court must select one of only four courses of action: It may confirm the award,
correct and confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss the petition. [Citation.]”  (EHM Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours
of Hollywood, Inc. (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.)  “If an award is confirmed, judgment shall be
entered in conformity therewith.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1287.4.)  
 
The
court may not review “the merits of the dispute, the sufficiency of the
evidence, or the arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we correct or review an award
because of an arbitrator’s legal or factual error, even if it appears on the
award’s face.  Instead, we restrict our
review to whether the award should be vacated under the grounds listed in
section 1286.2.  [Citations.]”  (Roehl
v. Ritchie (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 338, 347; Luster v. Collins
(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1344.)     
 
Timeliness
of the Petition, Service, and Notice of Hearing
The petition must
state the substance, or attach copies of the arbitration agreement, the award,
and any written opinion.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.4.)  The petitioner
must serve the petition between 10 days and 4 years from the date the award was
served on the petitioner.  (Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.)  The petitioner
must serve the petition and notice of the hearing on the respondent “in the
manner provided in the arbitration agreement for the service of such petition
and notice” or “[i]f the arbitration agreement does not provide the manner in
which such service shall be made . . . [s]ervice within this State shall be
made in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4, subd. (a), (b).)¿¿ 
 
The award was made
on July 3, 2024 and served on Atlas on July 3, 2024.  Atlas filed the notice of hearing on August
22, 2024 and the petition on September 30, 2024.  Atlas personally served the petition on
Michael Pacheo on November 12, 2024 and Michelle Pacheco on November 14, 2024,
more than 10 days after July 3, 2024, but less than 4 years before July 1, 2028.
Atlas filed proofs of service on November 19, 2024.  
 
The petition is
timely and properly served.
 
Confirmation of
Arbitration Award
An arbitration
award is not directly enforceable until it is confirmed by a court and judgment
is entered.¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,  § 1287.6;
Jones v. Kvistad (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 836, 840.)  On the merits, the court must confirm the
award as made, unless it corrects or vacates the award, or dismisses the
proceeding.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286; Valsan Partners Limited Partnership
v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 809, 818.)  The petition must:¿ 
 
(a)  
Set
forth the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate
unless the petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement.¿ 
(b)  
Set
forth the names of the arbitrators.¿ 
(c)  
Set
forth or have attached a copy of the award and the written opinion of the
arbitrators, if any.¿ 
 
(Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1285.4.)  
 
Atlas’s petition
includes copies of the Contract, the arbitration agreement, and the arbitration
award and opinion.  (Petition to Confirm,
Exhs. 4(b), 4(c), and 8(c).)  The
petition includes the arbitrator’s name: Leslie Steven Marks.  
 
The Court may
therefore reach the merits of Atlas’s petition. 
(See Puccinelli v. Nestor (1956) 145 Cal.App.2d 48, 50.) 
 
The Pachecos do
not oppose this petition.
 
Accordingly, the
Court finds no grounds for denying the petition to confirm the arbitration
award.  
 
CONCLUSION
The Court grants Atlas Builders & Development,
Inc.’s petition and confirms the arbitration award of $71,784.47.  
 
ORDER
Michael E. Pacheco and Michelle Pacheco are ordered to
remit payment to Atlas within 30 days of the date of this order.
