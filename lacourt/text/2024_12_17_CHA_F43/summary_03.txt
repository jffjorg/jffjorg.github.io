The judge has ruled in favor of the defendant, Alejandra Gomez, and granted her motion to compel responses and responsive documents from Plaintiff Marcy Linares to Requests for Production, Set One.

The judge has ordered the plaintiff to serve code-compliant, objection-free responses and responsive documents to each individual request for production within 20 days of the date of the order. The sanctions issue will remain unresolved pending further clarification of the proof of service issue.
