SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
July 1, 2023,[1]
Plaintiffs Enrique Gomez and Marcy Linares (Plaintiffs) were involved in a
vehicle collision with Defendant Alejandra Gomez (Defendant).  As a result of the collision, Plaintiffs
suffered damages and serious injuries. 
Plaintiffs filed this action against Defendant on June 17, 2024,
alleging causes of action for (1) negligence and (2) “negligence
involvement”.  The “negligence
involvement” cause of action appears largely duplicative of the first cause of
action.  
 
On
July 29, 2024, Defendant propounded Requests for Production, Set One on Plaintiff
Linares.  Responses were due August 30,
2024.  Defendant gave Plaintiffs two
deadline extensions, but Plaintiffs did not serve responses. 
 
On
October 31, 2024, Defendant filed this motion to compel responses to her Request
for Production, Set One.  No opposition
has been filed.
 
MEET
AND CONFER
A
motion to compel answers or produce documents must include a declaration
stating facts showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the
issues mentioned in the motion before filing. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2025.480, subd. (b), 2016.040.)  
 
Defendant’s
counsel of record, Michael J. Lowell, declares he attempted to meet and confer
with Plaintiff’s counsel before filing this motion.  (Declaration of Michael J. Lowell, ¶ 2, Exh.
A.)  After Plaintiffs missed the August
30 deadline, Mr. Lowell sent Plaintiffs’ counsel a meet and confer letter
informing Plaintiffs they waived all objections and extending Plaintiffs’
deadline to respond to October 1, 2024. 
(Lowell Dec., ¶ 3, Exh. B.)  After
Plaintiffs missed the October 1 deadline, Mr. Lowell sent Plaintiffs’ counsel a
second letter extending the time to respond to October 15, 2024.  (Lowel Dec., ¶ 4, Exh. C.)  As of October 31, 2024, Plaintiffs have not
served responses. 
 
ANALYSIS
A
demanding party may move to compel responses to requests for production where
the responding party fails to provide any responses.  (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2031.300, subd. (b),
2030.290, subd. (b).)  The demanding
party must show the requests were properly served, that the time to respond
expired, and no response has been served. 
(Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare
Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403-404.)  The responding party must respond separately
to each demand by agreeing to comply, stating an inability to comply, or
objecting to all or part of the demand. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.210, subd. (a).)  The responding party must serve responses
within 30 days after the requests for production are served or according to an
agreed upon deadline extension.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2031.260, subd. (a)(1)-(3).) 

 
Defendant
has shown that she properly served Plaintiff Linares on July 29, 2024.  Plaintiffs did not serve responses or
responsive documents by the original August 30 deadline or any of Defendant’s
subsequent deadline extensions.  As of
October 31, 2024, Plaintiffs have not served responses or responsive
documents.  
 
Accordingly,
the Court orders Plaintiffs to serve code-compliant, objection-free responses and
responsive documents to each individual request for production.
 
On
December 13, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a declaration stating he was
unaware of this, and several other discovery motions filed by Defendant, until
he received notice of a December 11, 2024 ruling.  (Declaration of Bob Nehoray, ¶¶ 2-3.)  Counsel claims Defendant served the motions
to compel and the related discovery to email address pi@nehoraylaw.com rather
than the email addresses listed on the complaint and that he was never
contacted about meeting and conferring. 
(Nehoray Dec., ¶¶ 2-4.)  The
December 11 Notice of Ruling was sent to Plaintiff’s counsel at the email
address pi@nehoraylaw.com.
 
The
Court will address the proof of service issue at the hearing.
 
ORDER
1.  Defendant Alejandra Gomez’s motion to compel
responses and responsive documents to Requests for Production, Set One is
granted.
 
2.  Plaintiffs are ordered to serve responses and
responsive documents within twenty (20) days of the date of this order.
 
3.  The sanctions issues will remain unresolved
pending further clarification of the proof of service issue.
 
Defendant
to give notice.
