Case:               Evergreen Bank Group v. Armen Kovalenko (24STLC06714) 
 
 
TENTATIVE
RULING:
 
Plaintiff Evergreen Bank Group’s UNOPPOSED Application for
Writ of Possession 
is GRANTED. 
 
The Court finds that plaintiff has established the probable
validity of its claim to possession of the property, namely, a 2024 Polaris RZR
RZR XP 4 1000 PREM (VIN 3NSNMC996RF305058). 
 
On 12/22/23, plaintiff entered into a contract with
defendant Armen Kovalenko in connection with the purchase of an automobile.
(Urso Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. A.) Under this contract, upon a default of any
provision, plaintiff has the right to take the vehicle from defendant. (Urso Decl.
¶ 5 & Ex. A at ¶ 12.) On 2/20/24, defendant defaulted in payment on
the agreement. (Urso Decl. ¶ 7 & Ex. 3.) Plaintiff demanded surrender and
is entitled to return of the automobile. (Urso Decl. ¶ 9.)
 
No undertaking is required. The amount owed ($26,133.27)
exceeds the market value of the automobile ($22,940.00). (CCP § 515.010; Urso
Decl. ¶ 11 & Ex. 4.)
 
Redelivery bond is ordered. The written undertaking required
by defendant for redelivery or to stay delivery is in the amount of $22,940.00,
the market value of the vehicle. 
 
The Court will sign the proposed order, electronically
received on 10/4/24.
