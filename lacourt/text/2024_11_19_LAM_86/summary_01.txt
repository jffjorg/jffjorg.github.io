And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's application for a right to attach order against defendant Prinko Image Co. (USA), Inc. The order allows the plaintiff to attach $15,276.29, which is the outstanding balance on a promissory note. The note was executed on March 27, 2024, and was due to be paid in full by May 8, 2024. The defendant did not make the payment, and the plaintiff is seeking to recover the amount owed.

The judge finds that the plaintiff has established the probable validity of its claim and that the attachment is sought for the purpose of recovering on the claim. The judge also finds that the amount to be attached is greater than zero.

The judge notes that the parties dispute the outstanding balance owed, with the plaintiff claiming an amount of $18,485.32 and the defendant claiming an amount of $15,276.29. The judge finds that the defendant's partial payments of $26,568.32 should be credited to the balance, and therefore the outstanding balance is $15,276.29.

The judge orders that the plaintiff post an undertaking in the amount of $10,000 before any attachment order can issue. The judge also modifies the proposed order to reflect the correct amount of attachment and to require the defendant to transfer any funds in its accounts at Chase Bank in an amount not to exceed $15,276.29.
