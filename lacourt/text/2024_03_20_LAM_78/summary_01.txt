And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Rogelio Valenzuela Sanchez v. General Motors, LLC (22STCV33471). The case involves a lemon law claim, where the plaintiff alleges that the vehicle was delivered with defects that the defendant could not repair after a reasonable number of opportunities. The plaintiff moves for an order compelling the defendant to produce further responses to requests for production of documents.

The Judge has granted the motion in part and denied it in part. The defendant is ordered to produce documents related to internal analysis or investigation regarding defects in vehicles of the same year, make, and model as the subject vehicle, as well as repair orders and invoices concerning the subject vehicle. The defendant is also ordered to provide a verified response indicating the responsive documents, and to provide a privilege log if it is asserting attorney-client or work product privilege.

The Judge has declined to impose sanctions on this occasion, but notes that the motion was avoidable by both sides given the information provided at the informal discovery conference. The Judge emphasizes that the defendant must produce documents relevant to defects with the plaintiff's vehicle, and that the plaintiff's moving papers state that the vehicle was from 2021, but appears to have produced documents for vehicles of the correct year, 2019.
