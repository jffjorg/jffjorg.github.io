And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the County of Los Angeles's demurrer to the petition for a writ of mandate is sustained. The petition, filed by Lopez-Reyes, alleges that the County of Los Angeles Planning Department leadership is in violation of state laws by denying a building permit for a housing development. The judge found that the petition is uncertain and fails to state sufficient facts, making it impossible for the County of Los Angeles to reasonably respond. The judge also found that the petition does not provide a basis for bringing a writ of mandate under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. As a result, the judge has given the petitioner 20 days to amend the petition.
