Defense counsel asserts that he attempted to
meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel regarding the objections to
Plaintiff’s Complaint. (Spivey Decl. ¶ 3, Ex. A.) “Any determination by the court that the meet and confer
process was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a
demurrer.” (CCP, § 430.41(a)(4).) As the failure to meet and confer does not
constitute grounds to overrule a demurrer, the court address the demurrer and
the motion to strike on the merits.
