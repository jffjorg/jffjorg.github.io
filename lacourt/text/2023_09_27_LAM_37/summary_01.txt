And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the Synergy Defendants' motion to compel arbitration and stay the action without prejudice. The Synergy Defendants had moved to compel arbitration and stay the action based on service agreements containing an arbitration clause. However, the court finds that the parties no longer have a controversy that is subject to an agreement to arbitrate, as the Plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed their claims against the Synergy Defendants and the ninth cause of action. The court also notes that the arbitration agreement does not exempt claims against Synergy from arbitration, as the Synergy Defendants dispute. Finally, the court declines to allow discovery regarding the authenticity and enforceability of Synergy's service agreements, as the dispute has been resolved. The court's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1281.2, 1292.4, and 1281.4, as well as case law, including Omar v. Ralphs Grocery Co. and Cardiff Equities, Inc. v. Superior Court.
