Discussion
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
A.        Demurrer 
 
A demurrer is an
objection to a pleading, the grounds for which are apparent from either the
face of the complaint or a matter of which the court may take judicial notice.
(CCP § 430.30, subd. (a); see also Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311,
318.)¿“To survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts
sufficient to state a cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might
eventually form part of the plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.”¿(C.A. v.
William S. Hart Union High School Dist. (2012) 53
Cal.4th 861, 872.)¿For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the cause of action, the
demurrer admits the truth of all material facts properly pleaded.¿ (Aubry v.
Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967.)¿A demurrer “does
not admit contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.”¿(Daar v.
Yellow Cab Co. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713.)¿¿ 
 
B.        Motion to Strike 
 
¿Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP § 436(a)-(b); Stafford
v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not
essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be
stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿ 
 
C.        Leave to Amend 
 
“Where the defect
raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer is reasonably capable of cure,
leave to amend is routinely and liberally granted to give the plaintiff a
chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD Construction, Inc. v. City of
San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.) The burden is on the
complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Goodman
v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿ 
II.        Demurrer[1]
A.        Summary of Complaint 
The
Complaint alleges that Plaintiff entered a month-to-month lease on November 1,
1993, for a property located at 6915 Fountain Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90028
(hereinafter the “Property”). (Compl. ¶¶ 6, 13.) On or about April 1, 2020,
ownership of the Property was transferred to Defendant Shan Kravich
(“Kravich”), who transferred the Property to his trust, the SK2022 Trust dated
February 16, 2022. (Compl. ¶ 16.)  Figure
8 has acted as property manager of the Property since April 2018.  (Compl. ¶ 15.)
 
The
Complaint alleges that the Property’s condition was substandard and
uninhabitable, due to inadequate weather protection, inadequate plumbing and
gas, unsanitary conditions, structural hazards, nuisance, and Defendants’
failure to maintain the property in a good and safe condition. (Compl. ¶¶ 19,
20.)
 
Defendants
now demur to the fourth and sixth causes of action. 
 
B.        Fourth
Cause of Action: Private Nuisance
 
The
essence of an action for private nuisance is a substantial, unreasonable
interference with the plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of his property. (See Mendez
v. Rancho Valencia Resort Partners, LLC (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 248, 262-263.)
California recognizes claims for nuisance based on residential habitability
issues. (Stoiber v. Honeychuck (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, 920.) 
 
Defendants
assert that Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action for nuisance is duplicative of
Plaintiff’s third cause of action for negligence because the nuisance cause of
action relies on the same operative facts as the negligence claim. “Where negligence and nuisance causes of action
rely on the same facts about lack of due care, the nuisance claim is a negligence claim.” (El Escorial
Owners' Assn. v. DLC Plastering, Inc.¿(2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 1337, 1349.)
The nuisance claim “stands or falls with the determination of
the¿negligence¿cause¿of¿action” in such cases. (Pamela W. v. Millsom (1994)
25 Cal.App.4th 950, 954, fn. 1; see also Melton v. Boustred (2010)
183 Cal.App.4th 521.)
 
Plaintiff does not deny that the
nuisance and negligence claim rely on the same facts but asserts he can plead
alternative theories of liability. “When a pleader is in doubt about what actually occurred or
what can be established by the evidence, the modern practice allows that party
to plead in the alternative and make inconsistent allegations.” (Mendoza v.
Continental Sales Co. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1395, 1402.) The fact that
Plaintiff can plead alternative theory of liabilities does not mean Plaintiff’s
nuisance cause of action is properly pled. As stated above, where a nuisance
cause of action relies on the same operative facts as the negligence cause of
action, the nuisance claim is subsumed into the negligence claim. (See El Escorial Owners' Assn., supra, 154 Cal.App.4th at
p. 1349.)
 
Plaintiff’s negligence claim alleges that due to
the landlord-tenant relationship between Plaintiff and Defendants, Defendants
were required to maintain and repair the Property and Defendants are in breach
of the common law and statutory warranty of habitability. (Compl. ¶ 42.) Plaintiff’s
nuisance claim alleges that Defendants’ actions constituted a private nuisance
because the “Defendants allowed
conditions that were injurious to the health and safety of Plaintiff and were
indecent and offensive such that it interfered substantially with Plaintiff’s
right to use and quietly enjoy the Subject Property.” (Compl. ¶ 70.) “The Defendants’
actions and inactions deprived Plaintiff of a healthy and comfortable use
of the Subject Property.” (Compl. ¶
71.)
 
In Paragraphs 40 and 69, the negligence and
nuisances cause of action “re-alleg[e] and incorporate[e] by reference each and
every allegation contained
in the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint as though fully set forth
herein.” (Compl. ¶¶ 40, 69.) Consequently, the facts contained in Paragraphs 13
to 39 of the Complaint apply equally to the negligence and nuisance cause of
action such that the court cannot find that Plaintiff’s nuisance cause of
action relies on different operative facts than his negligence cause of action.
“The complaint thus alleges only one cause of
action because it alleges one primary right, that is, plaintiff's right to the
unimpaired ownership and undisturbed enjoyment of his premises; a corresponding
duty, that is, an obligation on the part of defendants not to interfere with
that right; and a breach of that duty by defendants.” (Van Zyl v. Spiegelberg (1969) 2
Cal.App.3d 367, 372.) 
 
A claim for nuisance may be easier to prove than a claim for
negligence because “a plaintiff need only show that the defendant
committed the acts that caused injury, whereas in the latter, a plaintiff must
establish a duty to act and prove that the defendant's failure to act
reasonably in the face of a known danger breached that duty and caused damages.”
(Lussier v. San Lorenzo Valley Water Dist. (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 92, 106.)
Here, the Complaint fails to allege separate facts that do not arise from
Defendants’ alleged lack of due care in maintaining the property in habitable
condition. The nuisance cause of action must specify separate facts that show
that the Defendants’ conduct, rather than lack of due care, caused defective
conditions to exist on the Property that were injurious to the health and safety of Plaintiff and that the
defective conditions substantially interfered with Plaintiff’s comfortable
enjoyment of life or property. (Civ.
Code, § 3479.)
 
As
Plaintiff has failed to show that the nuisance cause of action is not
duplicative of the negligence cause of action, the demurrer to the fourth cause
of action is sustained with leave to amend. 
 
C.        Sixth Cause of Action: Intentional
Infliction of Emotional Distress
 
Defendants
allege that the Complaint fails to allege
sufficient facts to state a cause of action for intentional infliction of
emotional distress (“IIED”). “The elements of
a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress are: “‘(1)
outrageous conduct by the defendant, (2) intention to cause or reckless disregard of
the probability of causing emotional distress, (3) severe emotional suffering
and (4) actual and proximate causation of the emotional distress.’” [Citations omitted.]
(Wong v. Jing (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 1354, 1376.)  
 
It
is settled law that the California Supreme Court has set a “high bar” for what
can constitute severe distress. (Id., citing Hughes v. Pair (2009) 46 Cal. 4th
1035, 1051.)  “Severe emotional distress
means ‘“emotional distress of such substantial quality or enduring quality that
no reasonable [person] in civilized society should be expected to endure it.”’
[Citations.]” (Id.)

In his opposition, Plaintiff maintains
the Complaint can be amended to include additional facts to support the IIED
claim, including Defendants’ alleged attempts to force Plaintiff out of the
Property through unfounded 3-day notices to quit. (Opp. at 4:11-14.)
Nevertheless, Plaintiff maintains that the IIED claim is supported by the
underlying claims in the Complaint. Plaintiff’s four-page opposition fails to
point out what facts show that Defendants’ conduct was extreme and outrageous
and caused emotional distress to Plaintiff. 
 
As this is Plaintiff’s first demurrer, the court sustains
the demurrer to the sixth cause of action with leave to amend. 
 
III.      Motion to Strike
 
Defendants
seek to strike the following from Plaintiff’s Complaint: 
 
1)     All
references to punitive damages
2)     Pages
9-10, paragraph 39, in its entirety
3)     Page
11, paragraph 51, in its entirety
4)     Page
13, paragraph 62, in its entirety
5)     Page
15, paragraph 76, in its entirety
6)     Prayer
For Relief, paragraph 4
 
In
his opposition, Plaintiff agreed to remove punitive damage allegations from
Paragraphs 51 and 52 of the Complaint. Therefore, Defendants’ Motion to Stike
Paragraph 51 is granted without leave to amend. 
 
Defendants
assert that despite alleging negligence, Plaintiff’s Complaint fails to allege
specific facts of intentional, despicable, or vile conduct to support a claim
for punitive damages. 
 
The
complaint alleges that on March 29, 2022, Plaintiff made a maintenance request
about leaks on the Property’s walls and ceilings that caused areas in the unit
to soak and become soggy, mold to form and grow inside the walls of the Property
and damaged the ceiling to such an extent that the ceiling started to cave
inward and threaten the Plaintiff’s health and safety. (Compl. ¶ 26.) The
Complaint alleges that Defendant Kravich canceled and ignored Plaintiff’s March
29, 2022, maintenance request and the April 7, 2022, maintenance request.
(Compl. ¶ 26.) 
 
As
conditions continued to worsen, Plaintiff was forced to make another complaint
with the Los Angeles Housing Department (“LAHD”) which issued a notice of
violations to Kravich regarding dampness, unmaintained
plaster/drywall/ceilings, and a gaping hole in the Property ceiling. (Id.)
Plaintiff was forced to make another maintenance request on May 5, 2022,
regarding mildew and soggy ceilings due to the Defendants delay in repairing
the unit. (Id.) The complaint alleges Defendants’ failure to repair the
water leaks and mold caused Plaintiff significant bodily injury, emotional
distress, and property damage. (Id. ¶ 28.) Defendants intentionally
and/or negligently failed to repair and eliminate the water leaks and mold to
save money and increase their cash flow and net income from the operation and
management of the Property. (Id.)
 
Based
on the above, the court finds that the complaint sufficiently alleges that
Defendants abused the landlord/tenant relationship by failing to
maintain the premises in a habitable and safe condition. (Compl. ¶ 20.)
Moreover, at this stage in the pleadings, Plaintiff is not required to prove
the allegations or his entitlement to punitive damages. (See Fisher v. San
Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 604.)
 
Therefore, the
Defendants’ motion to strike Paragraphs 39 and 62 in the Complaint and
Paragraph 4 in the Prayer for Relief is denied. However, because the demurrer
to the fourth cause of action was sustained with leave to amend, the motion to
strike Paragraph 76 is granted with leave to amend. 
 
Defendants’ motion to
strike is granted without leave to amend as to Paragraph 51, granted with leave
to amend as to Paragraph 76, and denied as to Paragraphs 39 and 62, and Paragraph
4 in the Prayer for Relief. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendants’ demurrer to the
fourth and sixth causes of action is sustained with leave to amend. Defendants’ motion to strike is granted
without leave to amend as to Paragraph 51, granted with leave to amend as to
Paragraph 76, and denied as to Paragraphs 39, 62, and Paragraph 4 in the Prayer
for Relief.
