Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff Gyanmitra Prasad's motion for reconsideration of the Court's order granting Defendant Robert Wiener's special motion to strike. The judge found that Plaintiff did not meet his burden to show that counsel's mistake in opposing the underlying motion was a "new" or "different" matter under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, or grounds for relief under section 473(b). The judge also found that Plaintiff's belated request for discovery was not a new or different matter, as Plaintiff could have sought discovery prior to the hearing. Additionally, the judge found that the new evidence presented in support of the opposition did not result in a different outcome and did not demonstrate that the declaration, if considered, would have changed the result.
