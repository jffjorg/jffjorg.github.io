Property Manager LLC v. Drinkwater
CASE NO.:                24SMCV02785
MOTION:                  Motion
to Compel Initial Discovery Responses (form and special interrogatories and
production of documents)
HEARING DATE:   12/11/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding
party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction.
(CCP § 2030.290(b).) The statute contains no time limit for a motion to compel
where no responses have been served. All that need be shown in the moving
papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing
party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind
has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 902,
905-906.) 
 
Where there has been no timely
response to a CCP section 2031.010 inspection demand, the demanding party must
seek an order compelling a response. (CCP § 2031.300.) Failure to timely
respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product. Thus,
unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief from waiver, he
or she cannot raise objections to the documents demanded. There is no deadline
for a motion to compel responses. Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving
party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing the motion.
Where the motion seeks only a response to the inspection demand, no showing of
"good cause" is required.   
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Plaintiff Diplomat Property Manager LLC moves to compel initial
discovery responses as to its Requests for Form and Special Interrogatories,
and Requests for Production of Documents against Defendant Ginger Drinkwater,
and requests sanctions against Drinkwater in the amount of $1,215.00 for each
of the motions.
 
On August 9, 2024, Plaintiff served Drinkwater with the subject
discovery. (Yassin Decl., ¶ 2.) Drinkwater’s responses were due September 13,
2024. On September 17, 2024, having received no discovery responses, Plaintiff sent
a letter to Drinkwater notifying her of the outstanding responses and requesting
responses by September 30, 2024. (Id., ¶ 4.) Drinkwater failed to respond to
the outstanding discovery. (Id.¶¶ 5-6.) Plaintiff thus demonstrates
Drinkwater’s failure to respond to duly served discovery. No oppositions were
submitted.
 
Accordingly, the two motions are GRANTED. Sanctions are mandatory.
The claimed fees for these motions are unreasonable in light of the prior
motion and sanctions award. These motions are largely duplicative. Sanctions
are therefore imposed in the reasonable amount of $885.00 against Drinkwater.
Sanctions are payable within 30 days to Plaintiff’s counsel of record.
 
Further responses are ordered without objection within 10 days.
