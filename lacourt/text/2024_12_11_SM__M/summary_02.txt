Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion of Golden Blue Builders Group Inc. and Justin Kunkle (Defendants/Cross-Complainants) for leave to amend the cross-complaint to assert compulsory cross-claims against Plaintiff Van Lokeren Construction, Inc. The judge finds no significant delay in bringing the cross-claim against Plaintiff, and the delay that did occur was due to the Defendants' diligent efforts to obtain a stipulation from Plaintiff to agree to the filing of the cross-complaint. The judge notes that Plaintiff has experienced no prejudice as a result of the delay, and that granting leave to amend would not prejudice Plaintiff. The judge also rejects Plaintiff's argument that the claims are "malicious" and "frivolous" and designed to "sabotage Van Lokeren Construction Inc.'s relationship with the owner of a project," finding that Plaintiff has failed to substantiate this claim with sufficient evidence or argument. The judge orders that the first amended cross-complaint shall be filed as a separate document by December 12, 2024.
