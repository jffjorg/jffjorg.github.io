And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that a new trial is necessary in the case of Rebecca Lee Dudeck v. County of Los Angeles. The case was initially assigned to Judge Rupert Byrdsong, but he recused himself after it was discovered that he was professionally acquainted with defense counsel and had provided public endorsements. The judge found that this connection raised concerns about impartiality and that a new trial is necessary in the interests of justice. The judge's decision is based on the legal standard that a new trial may be granted if there is an irregularity in the proceedings, insufficiency of evidence, or error in law. The judge's ruling does not suggest any wrongdoing by either counsel, but rather that the disqualification of Judge Byrdsong and the corresponding voidness of the trial were caused by information that the judicial officer should have disclosed.
