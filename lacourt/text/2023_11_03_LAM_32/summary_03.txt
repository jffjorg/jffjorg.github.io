And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion filed by the plaintiffs to add a fraudulent misrepresentation claim to their complaint. The motion was filed after a deposition of the defendant's agent revealed evidence of fraudulent misrepresentation. The judge finds that the amendment is necessary and proper to resolve the potential fraud claim and that the plaintiffs are acting in good faith. The judge also finds that there is no prejudice to the defendant and grants the motion for leave to file the second amended complaint.
