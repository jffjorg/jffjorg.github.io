                        Plaintiffs,
            v.
 
VINE 312 N, LLC, 
                        Defendant. 


 
  Case No.:  21STCV45416
  Hearing Date:  November 3, 2023
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file
  second amended complaint 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            This is a landlord-tenant dispute
concerning habitability which was initially filed on December 13, 2021. The
operative First Amended Complaint was filed on March 21, 2022. 
            On October 6, 2023, Plaintiffs filed
the instant motion for leave to file a second amended complaint to add a fraudulent
misrepresentation claim. Defendant filed its opposition on October 23, 2023,
arguing that the motion failed to attach a copy of the proposed complaint. On
that same date, Plaintiffs filed an amended motion attaching the proposed
complaint. 
LEGAL STANDARD
The court may, in furtherance of justice,
and on such terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading. (Code
Civ. Proc, §§ 473, subd. (a), 576.) Courts must apply a policy of liberality in
permitting amendments at any stage of the proceeding, including during trial,
when no prejudice to the opposing party is shown. (Duchrow v. Forrest
(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1377.) In determining the extent of prejudice to
the opposing party, the court must consider various factors, such as whether
the amendment would delay trial or increase the discovery burden. (Demetriades
v. Yelp, Inc. (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 294, 306.)
DISCUSSION
            As a result of a deposition of
Defendant’s agent on October 3, 2023, Plaintiffs discovered evidence suggesting
fraudulent misrepresentation. (Diaz Decl. ¶ 3.) Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek to
add a fraud claim to their complaint. 
            The recent deposition explains when
the facts giving rise to the amendment were discovered and why the amendment was
not made earlier. (See Cal. Rules of Ct., Rule 3.1324(b)(3), (b)(4).) Plaintiffs
have set forth the effect of the amendment in their motion and by attaching the
proposed SAC. (Id., subd. (b)(1).) The amendment is necessary and proper
to resolve a potential fraud claim arising from the same facts. (Id.,
subd. (b)(2).)  
            Plaintiffs promptly filed this
motion after the deposition. Trial has been continued to February 2024. The new
cause of action is based on the same underlying facts and should not require
extensive additional discovery. Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiffs are
acting in good faith and that there is no prejudice to Defendant. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to
amend is GRANTED.
