  Case No.:  22STCV10963
  Hearing Date:  November 3, 2023
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiffs’ motion for civil liability
  under code of civil procedure section 701.020 et seq. 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On March 30, 2022, Plaintiffs Juan
Carlos Soria and Rudy Mananteau filed this action against Defendants Maureira
Construction, Inc. and Claudio Maureira, alleging (1) breach of contract, (2)
common count, (3) accounting, and (4) unjust enrichment. The action stems from Defendants’
failure to pay for Plaintiffs’ shareholder interest in Maureira Construction, Inc.
despite an agreement. 
            On July 15, 2022, Plaintiffs
obtained a judgment against Defendants in the amount of $71,704.29, which Defendants
have not paid. However, Defendants continue to operate the construction company
and turn a profit from their existing clients, including MZL Properties Inc.
(MZL). On October 31, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a motion to obtain an assignment to
the payments made by MZL and to restrain Defendants from assigning or otherwise
disposing of the right to payment. The motion was granted on December 5, 2022.
The Court ordered any payments owed by MZL to Defendants to be assigned to
Plaintiffs until satisfaction of the judgment. The Court ordered MZL to pay the
money to Plaintiffs’ attorneys. 
            On September 29, 2023, Plaintiffs
filed the instant motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 701.020 to
obtain the judgment amount from MZL on the grounds that MZL has failed to
comply with the assignment order. There is no opposition to the motion.  
LEGAL STANDARD
“[U]pon application of the judgment
creditor on noticed motion, the court may order the judgment debtor to assign
to the judgment creditor . . . all or part of a right to payment due or to
become due . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 708.510(a).) “A right to payment may be
assigned pursuant to this article only to the extent necessary to satisfy the
money judgment.” (Id., subd. (d).) “When an application is made pursuant
to Section 708.510 or thereafter, the judgment creditor may apply to the court
for an order restraining the judgment debtor from assigning or otherwise
disposing of the right to payment that is sought to be assigned.” (Id.,
§ 708.520(a).)
“If a third person is required by this
article to deliver property to the levying officer or to make payments to the
levying officer and the third person fails or refuses without good cause to do
so, the third person is liable to the judgment creditor for whichever of the
following is the lesser amount: (1) The value of the judgment debtor’s interest
in the property or the amount of the payments required to be made. (2) The
amount required to satisfy the judgment pursuant to which the levy is made.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 701.020(a).) 
DISCUSSION
            On December 5, 2022, Plaintiff’s
attorney mailed a letter to MZL explaining the assignment and attaching the
Court’s order. (Tokar Decl. ¶¶ 5-7, Ex. C-E.) The letter explained MZL’s
potential liability for failing to make payments as ordered. On September 6,
2023, MZL produced records pursuant to a subpoena, which revealed that MZL made
payments to Defendants between December 9, 2022 and January 27, 2023 totaling
$74,140. (Id., ¶ 10, Ex. H.)
            The uncontested evidence shows that
MZL had notice of the Court’s assignment order and failed to comply with it.
MZL paid money to Defendants instead of Plaintiffs’ attorney. Therefore, MZL is
liable under Code of Civil Procedure section 701.020(a).
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiffs’ motion for liability
under Code of Civil Procedure section 701.020 is GRANTED.
