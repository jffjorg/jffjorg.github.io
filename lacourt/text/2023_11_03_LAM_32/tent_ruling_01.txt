            v.

     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
cross-defendant’s demurrer to first
  amended cross-complaint




 


 



BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant Tipsntrends,
LLC initiated this action against Defendant and Cross-Complainant Aminogenesis,
LLC in February 2020. In July 2020, the parties jointly stipulated to proceed
in arbitration. In August 2021, the case was dismissed without prejudice. The
case was restored to active status in October 2022 after the failure of
arbitration. The order of dismissal was vacated. 
The complaint alleges that Defendant did
not pay for advertising services provided by Plaintiff. On May 24, 2023, Defendant
filed a cross-complaint against Plaintiff, alleging that Plaintiff did not
provide the services as promised. On August 6, 2023, the Court sustained Plaintiff’s
demurrer to the cross-complaint with leave to amend. The operative First
Amended Cross-Complaint was filed on August 24, 2023. The FACC asserts causes
of action for (1) breach of contract and (2) fraud.  
            On September 19, 2023, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
filed the instant demurrer the cross-complaint. Defendant/Cross-Complainant
filed its opposition on October 23, 2023. Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant filed its
reply on October 26, 2023.
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading
or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a).) A
demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic
matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior Court
(1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the defects
appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
Any party, within the time allowed to
respond to a pleading, may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the
whole or any part of that pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b).) The
court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it
deems proper, strike (1) any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any
pleading and (2) all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.
(Id., § 436.) The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of
the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Id., § 437.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to strike,
the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the party who
filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the motion to
strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be reached
through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.) The Court notes
that Cross-Defendant has complied with the meet and confer requirement. (See Kian
Decl.)
DISCUSSION
I.
Timely Amendment
            The Court’s order on August 2, 2023
instructed Cross-Complainant to file the FACC in twenty days and to provide
notice of the order. Cross-Complainant timely filed the FACC within twenty days
of the notice, which was served on August 4, 2023. Even if the amendment was
two days late, the Court declines to exercise its discretion to dismiss the
complaint for this reason. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 581(f) [“The court may
dismiss the complaint . . .”].)  
II.
Statute of Limitations
            The statute of limitations for an
action based upon a written contract is four years. (Code Civ. Proc., §
337(a).) The statute of limitations for an action based in fraud is three
years. (Id., § 338(d).) Cross-Defendant argues that the claims are
time-barred because the FACC “does not allege a distinct breach date. Instead,
the FACC alleges that several promises made ‘in 2017’ were breached at some
vague point in time.” (Dem. 7:15-17.) 
However, if the breach dates are not
specified in the complaint, then it cannot be determined as a matter of law
that the claims are time-barred. “The running of the statute must appear ‘clearly
and affirmatively’ from the dates alleged. It is not sufficient that the
complaint might be barred . . . If the dates establishing the running of the
statute of limitations do not clearly appear in the complaint, there is no
ground for general demurrer.” (Roman v. County of Los Angeles (2000) 85
Cal.App.4th 316, 324-325, citing Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher
(1995) 37 Cal. App. 4th 1397, 1403.) The dates that promises were made, or
contracts executed, are not necessarily the dates of breach. To the extent the
dates are unclear, the proper recourse is discovery, not dismissal. (Ibid.;
see also Ludgate, supra, 82 Cal.App.4th at p. 608.) 
III.
Fraud
“The elements of fraud that will give rise
to a tort action for deceit are: ‘(a) misrepresentation (false representation,
concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c)
intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e)
resulting damage.’” (Engalla v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc. (1997) 15
Cal.4th 951, 974, quoting Lazar v.
Superior Court (1996) 12
Cal.4th 631, 638.) Fraud must be pleaded with specificity rather than with
general and conclusory allegations. (Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003)
30 Cal.4th 167, 184.) The specificity requirement means a plaintiff must allege
facts showing how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations
were made. (Lazar, supra, 12 Cal.4th at p. 645.)
In its
opposition, Cross-Complainant points to four allegations that it contends are
pled with the required specificity. First, the FACC alleges that in August
2016, Cross-Defendant showed Cross-Complainant a mockup of the product
placements and told Cross-Complainant that there would be a maximum of twelve
product placements per page. (FACC ¶ 3.) The FACC also alleges that each time a
sign-off sheet was sent to Cross-Complainant for approval, the sheet stated
that all copy blocks would be equal. (Id., ¶ 6.) Furthermore, in March
2017, Cross-Defendant’s director of sales, Stacy Adams, agreed to run a free ad
in an upcoming publication in response to Cross-Complainant’s complaint that the
advertisements had not been conforming to specifications. (Id., ¶ 7.)
Lastly, in April 2017, Adams allegedly promised Cross-Complainant exclusivity
over competing products or brands from running the same page. (Id., ¶ 8.)

These
allegations are still insufficiently specific. Beyond the two statements
attributed to Adams, the FACC fails to identify who made the statements. Cross-Complainant
and Cross-Defendant are companies. “A plaintiff's burden in asserting a fraud
claim against a corporate employer is even greater. In such a case, the
plaintiff must ‘allege the names of the persons who made the allegedly
fraudulent representations, their authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what
they said or wrote, and when it was said or written.’” (Lazar, supra, 12
Cal.4th at p. 645, quoting Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991)
2 Cal.App.4th 153, 157.)
Additionally,
the FACC fails to specify how each statement was made. It is unclear how
Cross-Defendant “told” Cross-Complainant that there would be a maximum of
twelve placements per page. It is unclear how Adams “agreed” to run a free ad.
It is unclear how Adams “promised” Cross-Complainant exclusivity over competing
brands. Lastly, it remains unclear when each sign-off sheet was sent.    
The FACC otherwise
adequately alleges intent to defraud and knowledge of falsity. At the pleading
stage, “it is not necessary to allege the circumstantial evidence from which it
may be inferred that the representation or promise was false -- these are
evidentiary matters which give rise to the misrepresentation. The only
essential allegation is the general statement that the representation or
promise was false and that the defendant knew it to be false at the time it was
made.” (Universal By-Products, Inc. v. City of Modesto (1974) 43
Cal.App.3d 145, 151.) The FACC also alleges that Cross-Complainant relied on
the misrepresentations to continue purchasing ad spots. This sufficiently establishes
reliance, causation, and damages for pleading purposes.   
CONCLUSION
            Cross-Defendant Tipsntrends’
demurrer is SUSTAINED with leave to amend.
