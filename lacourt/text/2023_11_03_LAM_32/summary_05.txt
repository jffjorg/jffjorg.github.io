And here is the English text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a demurrer filed by defendant Marcus Fishman et al. in a quiet title action brought by plaintiff Ester Fishman. The plaintiff alleges that defendant was abusive and controlling during their marriage and seeks to claim legal title to two subject properties. The defendant argues that the action should be abated due to a pending divorce case between the parties, but the court finds that the issues are not identical between the two cases. The court also finds that exclusive concurrent jurisdiction does not apply because the family court has deferred the issues of ownership, value, and allocation of the properties to the existing civil action. Therefore, the court overrules the defendant's demurrer.
