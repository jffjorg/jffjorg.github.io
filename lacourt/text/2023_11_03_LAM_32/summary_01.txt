And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the first amended cross-complaint filed by Defendant/Cross-Complainant Aminogenesis, LLC. The Court finds that the demurrer is sustained with leave to amend. The Court notes that the demurrer was timely filed and that the Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant, Tipsntrends, Inc., has complied with the meet and confer requirement.

The Court finds that the first amended cross-complaint (FACC) alleges that the Plaintiff failed to provide the advertising services as promised and that the Defendant failed to pay for the services. The Court also finds that the FACC alleges that the Defendant fraudulently induced the Plaintiff to continue purchasing ad spots.

However, the Court finds that the allegations of fraud are insufficiently specific. The Court requires more specific details about who made the allegedly fraudulent representations, their authority to speak, to whom they spoke, what they said or wrote, and when it was said or written. The Court also requires more specific details about how each statement was made.

The Court notes that the FACC adequately alleges intent to defraud and knowledge of falsity. The Court also finds that the FACC adequately alleges reliance, causation, and damages for pleading purposes.

The Court grants the demurrer and allows the Defendant/Cross-Complainant to amend the cross-complaint to provide more specific details about the allegedly fraudulent representations.
