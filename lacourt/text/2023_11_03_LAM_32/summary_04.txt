And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants Plaintiffs' motion for civil liability under Code of Civil Procedure section 701.020. The Plaintiffs, Juan Carlos Soria and Rudy Mananteau, filed an action against Maureira Construction, Inc. and Claudio Maureira alleging breach of contract, common count, accounting, and unjust enrichment. The Plaintiffs obtained a judgment against the Defendants in the amount of $71,704.29, which has not been paid. The Plaintiffs filed a motion to obtain an assignment to the payments made by MZL Properties Inc. and to restrain the Defendants from assigning or disposing of the right to payment. The Court granted the motion and ordered MZL to pay the money to the Plaintiffs' attorney. Despite this, MZL failed to comply with the assignment order and made payments to the Defendants instead. The uncontested evidence shows that MZL had notice of the Court's assignment order and is thus liable under Code of Civil Procedure section 701.020(a). The Judge concludes that the Plaintiffs' motion for liability is granted.
