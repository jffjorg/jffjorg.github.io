  Case No.: 23STCV19342   
  Hearing Date:  November 3, 2023
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s demurrer to complaint 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On August 14, 2023, Plaintiff Ester
Fishman filed this quiet title action against Defendant Marcus Fishman and all
persons claiming any right in the subject property. Plaintiff and Defendant
were married in 2013 and separated in 2016. Plaintiff alleges that during the
parties’ relationship, Defendant was abusive and controlling. As a result, Plaintiff
alleges that under Defendant’s undue influence and coercion, Plaintiff granted
title of the two subject properties to both herself and Defendant even though Plaintiff
obtained the properties prior to marriage. Plaintiff filed this action to claim
legal title to the subject properties. 
            On September 28, 2023, Defendant
filed the instant demurrer for abatement on the grounds that there is a pending
divorce case between the parties relating to the subject properties. Plaintiff
filed her opposition on October 23, 2023. 
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering
demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in context. (Taylor v. City of Los Angeles Dept. of Water
and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.) In a demurrer
proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or by proper
judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd. (a).) A demurrer tests
the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior Court (1984) 153
Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the
face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a demurrer hearing is whether the
complaint, as it stands, unconnected with extraneous matters, states a cause of
action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th
at 747.) A complaint will survive demurrer if it sufficiently apprises the
defendant of the issues, and specificity is not required where discovery will
clarify the ambiguities. (See Ludgate Ins. Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp.
(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 592, 608.) All reasonable inferences are drawn in favor
of the complaint. (Kruss v. Booth (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 699, 713.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to strike,
the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the party who
filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the motion to
strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be reached
through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be
raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.) The Court notes
that Defendant has not complied with the meet and confer requirement. (See Fishman
Decl.) However, this is not a reason for overruling a demurrer. (Id., §
430.41(a)(4).) Therefore, the Court will proceed on the merits.  
DISCUSSION
I.
Abatement
A demurrer lies where “[t]here is another
action pending between the same parties on the same cause of action.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.10(c).) “In such a case, the defendant must show that the parties,
cause of action, and issues are identical, and the same evidence would support
the judgment in each case.” (California Union Ins. Co. v. Trinity River Land
Co. (1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 104, 108.) “The identity of two causes of action
is determined by a comparison of the facts alleged which show the nature of the
invasion of plaintiff's primary right.” (Bush v. Superior Court (1992)
10 Cal.App.4th 1374, 1384.)
            Here, Defendant points out that the
parties are currently involved in a divorce case, Fishman v. Fishman
(BD645333). Defendant argues that the pending divorce case affects the parties’
property rights and thereby overlaps with issues involved in this case.
Defendant requests an abatement to avoid duplication. 
            However, the statute governing quiet
title actions provides that “[t]he remedy provided in this chapter is
cumulative and not exclusive of any other remedy, form or right of action, or
proceeding provided by law for establishing or quieting title to property.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 760.030(a).) “In an action or proceeding in which establishing or
quieting title to property is in issue the court in its discretion may, upon
motion of any party, require that the issue be resolved pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter to the extent practicable.” (Id., subd. (b).)
The family court “deferred the issues of the ownership, value and allocation of
two parcels of property in dispute between the parties to the existing civil
action between the parties.” (Plntf.’s RJN, Ex. 1 at 2:10-11; Ex. 2 at
32:20-21.) Therefore, the conditions for abatement are not met because the
issues are not identical between the two cases. 
II.
Exclusive Concurrent Jurisdiction
“Under the rule
of exclusive concurrent jurisdiction, when two California superior
courts have concurrent jurisdiction over the subject matter and all parties
involved in litigation, the first to assume jurisdiction
has exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over the subject matter and
all parties involved until such time as all necessarily related matters have
been resolved. The rule is based upon the public policies of avoiding conflicts
that might arise between courts if they were free to make contradictory
decisions or awards relating to the same controversy, and preventing
vexatious litigation and multiplicity of suits.” (People ex rel.
Garamendi v. American Autoplan, Inc. (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 760,
769-770.) 
“[T]he rule of exclusive concurrent
jurisdiction does not require absolute identity of parties, causes of action or
remedies sought in the initial and subsequent actions.” (Garamendi, supra,
20 Cal.App.4th at p. 770.) “Moreover, the remedies sought in the separate
actions need not be precisely the same so long as the court exercising original
jurisdiction has the power to litigate all the issues and grant all the relief
to which any of the parties might be entitled under the pleadings.” (Ibid.)
            For the same reasons discussed
above, exclusive concurrent jurisdiction does not apply. There is no risk of “contradictory
decisions or awards relating to the same controversy” because the issue of
ownership of the two properties was expressly removed from the divorce case.
The family court also does not have “the power to litigate all the issues and
grant all the relief to which any of the parties might be entitled” because
that court is expressly not resolving the property issue.
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s demurrer is OVERRULED.
