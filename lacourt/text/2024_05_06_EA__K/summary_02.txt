The Plaintiff had sought a default judgment against several defendants, including NES Investment LLC, after they failed to respond to the lawsuit. The Plaintiff had also sought attorney's fees and recovery of outstanding amounts owed. The Judge ordered the Plaintiff to provide additional information and requested that Alvaro Garcia, a representative of the Plaintiff, attach a statement of account and billing statement(s) to any amended declaration.
