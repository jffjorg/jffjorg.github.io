And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Jared D. Moses regarding a breach of contract action arising from a real estate transaction. The Plaintiffs, Robert and Vergine Martirossian, allege that the Defendants, including Unikex LLC, Xiaolin Li, Nartin Inc., Universal Realty Inc., and others, breached the real estate purchase agreement by fraudulently representing the condition of the property. The Defendant Unikex filed a motion to compel arbitration, which the Plaintiff opposed. The Judge grants the motion, finding that a written agreement to arbitrate exists and that it encompasses the claims alleged by the Plaintiffs. The Judge orders that the parties participate in arbitration and sets a post-arbitration status conference for December 4, 2024.
