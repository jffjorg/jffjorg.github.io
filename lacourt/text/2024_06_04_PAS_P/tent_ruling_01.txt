  Case Number:  19STCV07619    Hearing Date:   June 4, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO STRIKE OR TAX COSTS I.        INTRODUCTION
          This is a personal injury
case involving a car accident. The matter was tried before a jury, which rendered a
verdict in Plaintiff’s favor on December 6, 2023.  Plaintiff’s counsel filed his memorandum of
costs on January 31, 2024. Defendant filed a motion to strike or tax costs on February 15, 2024. Plaintiff filed an opposition on
April 17, 2024. Defendant filed a reply on April 19, 2024. The motion is denied.
  
II. REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE
Plaintiff requests judicial notice of various distances
between locations, as provided by Google Map printouts. As the distance between
two distinct defined locations is not reasonably subject to dispute, the Court
takes judicial notice of the distances but not the veracity of the Google Maps
printouts, as those can be altered at any time by anybody.
III.     LEGAL
STANDARD  
          CCP Section 1032 provides that a prevailing party may
recover their costs. (CCP § 1032.) CCP Section 1033.5(a) itemizes allowable
costs; CCP Section 1033.5(b) itemizes costs that are not allowed. Subsection
(c) provides that costs shall be necessary to the litigation and reasonable in
amount, and that items of cost not mentioned in the statute are recoverable in
the court’s discretion.     
IV.     ANALYSIS
          Defendant argues that the majority of the costs sought by
the memorandum of costs are excessive and unreasonable. Specifically, Defendant
objects to the filing fees, process server fees, service fees, copy fees,
witness fees, fees for production of a poster, parking fees, mediation fees and
interest fees.
          Defendant argues that the ordinary witness fees ($80.40 in
total) are excessive and that mediation costs ($2,500 in total) are excessive
and not recoverable under CCP Section 1033.5. However, Section 1033.5 provides
for recovery of costs “required to be awarded to the prevailing party pursuant
to statute as an incident to prevailing in the action.” (CCP § 1033.5(a)(16).) While
section 1033.5 does not explicitly permit mediation costs, it also does not forbid
them. 
The
Court declines to strike these costs, as they were either explicitly authorized
by statute or reasonably necessary to this litigation. As to the mediation
costs, the Court relies on Gibson v. Bobroff (1996) 49 Cal. App. 4th
1202, in which the Court of Appeal upheld the trial court’s ruling denying defendant’s
motion to tax costs and allowing plaintiff to recover the cost of mediation.
While the mediation in that case was court ordered, Gibson’s reasoning
applies here.  As noted by the Gibson
court, “mediation is fundamental to the conduct of litigation as it encourages
the parties to settle their disputes before trial and exposes parties who fail
to agree to a reasonable settlement proposal to the risk of a discretionary
court determination that they should pay their opponent's share of the failed
mediation.” Id. at 1209.  
          Defendant also objects to several other categories of costs
on the memorandum of costs but no substantive argument is advanced in the motion.
The only mention of the filing fees, process server fees, service fees, copy
fees, expert witness fees, production fees, interest fees and parking fees is
in the notice of motion. Nevertheless, the Court considers the argument and
concludes that all the named fees are recoverable under CCP Section 1033.5.
(CCP § 1033.5(a)(1), (3), (4), (8), (13), (14),(16).) The Court declines to
strike these costs. Plaintiff has provided additional supporting documentation
in her opposition.
          In opposition, Plaintiff argues that the relevant standard is
“‘[i]f items on their face appear to be proper charges, the verified memorandum
of costs is prima facie evidence of their propriety, and the burden is on the
party seeking to tax costs to show they were not reasonable or necessary.’” (See
Jones v. Dumrichob, (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1258, 1266.) Indeed,
“Defendant's mere statements in the points and authorities accompanying its
notice of motion to strike cost bill and the declaration of its counsel are
insufficient to rebut the prima facie showing.” (See Rappenecker v. Sea-Land
Service Inc. (1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 256, 266.) Here, there is a verified
memorandum of costs, so the burden of showing that the costs sought were not
reasonable or necessary was on Defendant. Defendant only presented a memorandum
of points and authorities. Despite this, the Court assumes arguendo the arguments
advanced by Defendant.
          In sum, the Court taxes $0. Costs are granted in the amount
of $19,972.41.
V.       CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
          The Court denies Defendant’s motion to tax costs. Costs are
granted in the amount of $19,972.41.
          Counsel for Plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.

ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEESI.        INTRODUCTION   This is a personal injury case involving a car
accident. The case was tried before a jury, which rendered a verdict in Plaintiff’s favor
on December 6, 2023.  Plaintiff now moves
for an order fixing her attorney’s fees award. The motion is granted and fees
are awarded in the amount requested.           This motion was filed April 5, 2024. Defendant filed an
opposition on April 15, 2024. Plaintiffs filed a reply on April 22, 2024.  II. EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONSPlaintiff’s
Evidentiary Objections to Araujo Declaration (10):The following objections are sustained: 1 (lack of
personal knowledge), 2 (lack of personal knowledge), 3 (lack of personal
knowledge), The following objections are overruled: 4 (has
foundation), 5 (has foundation), 6 (has foundation), 7 (has foundation), 8 (has
foundation), 9 (has foundation), 10 (has foundation)III.     LEGAL
STANDARD          Code Civ. Proc. §1033.5(a)(1) provides for attorney fees as
costs when provided for by contract, statute, or law. CCP 2033.420 allows attorney
fees to be recovered in the following circumstances: “(a) If a party fails to
admit the genuineness of any document or the truth of any matter when requested
to do so under this chapter, and if the party requesting that admission
thereafter proves the genuineness of that document or the truth of that matter,
the party requesting the admission may move the court for an order requiring
the party to whom the request was directed to pay the reasonable expenses
incurred in making that proof, including reasonable attorney’s fees.(b) The court shall make
this order unless it finds any of the following:(1) An objection to the
request was sustained or a response to it was waived under Section 2033.290.(2) The admission sought
was of no substantial importance.(3) The party failing to
make the admission had reasonable ground[s] to believe that that party would
prevail on the matter.(4) There was other good
reason for the failure to admit.” (CCP § 2033.420.) “[T]he party seeking to benefit from an
exception to a general statute bears the burden to establish the exception.” (Samsky
v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. (2019) 37
Cal.App.5th 517, 523, internal citations omitted.)           Civ. Code §1717 (a)
provides in part that “reasonable attorney’s fees shall be fixed by the court
and shall be an element of the costs of suit.”          PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084
contains the Supreme Court’s explanation of how fees are to be determined. It
states that Civ. Code §1717, “reflects the legislative purpose ‘to establish
uniform treatment of fee recoveries in actions on contracts containing attorney
fee provisions.’ (Citation.) Consistent with that purpose, the trial court has
broad authority to determine the amount of a reasonable fee.” (Id. at
1095.) PLCM teaches that fees are to be determined by calculating the
“‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the
reasonable hourly rate.” (Id.)   IV.     ANALYSISA. The Fees Were Incurred due to the
Denial of Requests for AdmissionsPlaintiff argues that Defendant failed to admit the
genuineness of Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions. The Court agrees. (See
Harshman Decl. Exh. D.) Plaintiff then prevailed at trial, with the jury
finding that Defendant caused Plaintiff’s injuries. (See 1/16/24 Minute Order.)
In opposition, Defendant argues that the motion is
untimely. The Court disagrees. (See Reply p. 2: 14-24.) Defendant also argues
that Plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proof by not pointing to
specific evidence. However, this is not required under CCP Section 2033.420 nor
does Defendant cite any other authority containing this requirement.Defendant also argues that the admissions sought
were not of substantial importance. (CCP § 2033.420(b)(2).) The Court
disagrees, as the RFAs request that Defendant admit that Plaintiffs were
injured in the accident and that Defendant caused the accident and Plaintiff’s
subsequent injuries. This is the essence of this case. The Court disagrees with
Defendant that these admissions are not of substantial importance.Defendant argues that because its responses to the
RFAs were unverified, they amount to no response at all, citing Appleton v.
Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3rd 632, 635-636. This may well be true; however,
no response is the functional equivalent to denial. Whether Defendant did not
respond or denied the admission still functions as a failure to admit the
genuineness of the admissions. (CCP § 2033.420.)Lastly, Defendant argues that it reasonably believed
it would prevail at trial. (CCP § 2033.420(b)(3).) In support, Defendant cites
Universal Home
Improvement, Inc. v. Robertson (2020) 51 Cal.App.5th 116, 130-132 for the
proposition that a reasonable belief may be formed if supported by expert
witnesses and evidence. Defendant then cites that at trial, it put on expert
witnesses and presented evidence of the damage done to the vehicles. However,
Defendant fails to meet its burden demonstrating that it relied on such
evidence when denying or failing to respond to the Requests for Admissions. The
evidence Defendant put on at trial has no clear bearing on this motion, as this
exception pertains to whether Defendant had a reasonable belief it would
prevail at trial at the time it failed to admit the genuineness of the admissions.
(See Reply p. 5: 9-16.)In support of her position, Plaintiff cites Grace v. Mansourian (2015) 240 Cal. App. 4th 523,
which bears some similarity to the present case.  In Grace, an automobile accident case, the Court of Appeal found
that the trial court erred in denying Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s fees
after Plaintiff prevailed at trial.  The
Court of Appeal found that Defendant’s failure to admit certain requests for
admission prior to trial justified the imposition of an attorney’s fees award.  The Court finds Grace’s reasoning
persuasive.B.
Reasonableness of FeesThe
analysis of reasonableness of attorney fee awards considers “the nature of the
litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required and skill
employed in handling the litigation, the attention given, the success of the
attorney’s efforts, his learning, his age, and his experience in the particular
type of work demanded…” (Berry v. Chaplin (1946) 74 Cal.App.2d 669,
678-679, citations omitted.) There is no requirement that billing records be
provided to a trial court in connection with a motion for fees pursuant to
contract. The declaration of counsel as to the hours spent on this litigation
and the hourly rates charged for such time is all that is required. “[T]here is
no legal requirement that an attorney supply billing statements to support a
claim for attorney fees.” (Mardirossian & Associates, Inc. v. Ersoff
(2007) 135 Cal.App.4th 257, 269.) “[T]here is no legal requirement that such
statements be offered in evidence. An attorney’s testimony as to the number of
hours worked is sufficient evidence to support an award of attorney fees, even
in the absence of detailed time records.” (Steiny & Co., Inc. v.
California Electric Supply Co. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 285, 293.) The declarations
of Plaintiff’s counsels, David M. Shaby and R. Christopher Harshman, provide a
sufficient basis for the fee request. Shaby and Harshman provide a table of the
time spent on this case after the serving of the Requests for Admissions.
(Shaby Decl. ¶ 3, Harshman Decl. ¶ 6.)          The Court has examined the evidence presented by Plaintiffs
and makes the following findings: the rates requested are reasonable and 86.5
hours is a reasonable amount of time spent, given the length of this case (5 years).
As such, the Court GRANTS the motion for attorney fees in the amount of $44,674.00
($31,625 +$13,050).            The Court awards $44,674.00
in attorney fees.V.       CONCLUSION
AND ORDER          Plaintiff’s motion for attorney fees is granted. The Court
awards attorney’s fees in the amount of $44,674.00.Plaintiffs’ counsel to give
notice of this order.            Dated:  6/4/24                                                 _______________________________                                                                                  JARED D. MOSES
