  Case Number:  24STCP02243    Hearing Date:   September 20, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Hearing on J.G. Wentworth’s Petition for Approval for Transfer of Payment Rights
 
J.G. Wentworth’s First Amended Petition (“FAP”) for Approval for Transfer of Payment Rights is denied
without prejudice.
 
BACKGROUND
By way of this petition, Petitioner
J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC (“Petitioner”) seeks a transfer of future life
contingent payments in the aggregate amount of $505,253.55, to which Real
Party-In-Interest/Transferor Trisha Shepherd (“Payee”) is entitled, in exchange
for a one-time payment of $3,000, where the discounted present value of the
future payments is $63,415.45. Amended Petition at p. 34. 
In 2002, Payee received a structured
settlement by and through a Guardian ad Litem, arising from a medical
malpractice claim. The settlement agreed to by Payee provides for periodic
structured payments including, but not limited to,  1) 9 monthly life-contingent payments of
$2,246.96 each, beginning on June 19, 2056, and ending on February 19, 2057, and
2) 171 monthly life-contingent payments of $2,314.37 each, increasing at 3%
annually, beginning on March 19, 2057, and ending on 13 May 19, 2071. 
Petitioner now moves for approval of
the transfer of these structured settlement payment rights by Payee to
Petitioner and/or its assigns in exchange for $3,000.
LEGAL STANDARD
A transfer of structured settlement payment rights is
void unless a court reviews and approves the transfer and finds that (a) the
transfer of the structured settlement payment rights is fair and reasonable and
in the best interest of the payee, taking into account the welfare and support
of his or her dependents, and (b) the transfer complies with the requirements
of Insurance Code Sections 10134 to 10139.5, will not contravene other
applicable law, and that the court has reviewed and approved the transfer as
provided in Section 10139.5. See § 10137, subds. a)-(b).[1]
The court must make express written findings that “(1)
The transfer is in the best interest of the payee, taking into account the
welfare and support of the payee’s dependents. [¶] (2) The payee has been
advised in writing by the transferee to seek independent professional advice
regarding the transfer and has either received that advice or knowingly waived,
in writing, the opportunity to receive the advice. [¶] (3) The transferee has
complied with the notification requirements pursuant to paragraph (2) of
subdivision (f), the transferee has provided the payee with a disclosure form
that complies with Section 10136, and the transfer agreement complies with
Sections 10136 and 10138. [¶] (4) The transfer does not contravene any
applicable statute or the order of any court or other government authority. [¶]
(5) The payee understands the terms of the transfer agreement, including the
terms set forth in the disclosure statement required by Section 10136. [¶] (6)
The payee understands and does not wish to exercise the payee's right to cancel
the transfer agreement.” §§ 10139.5(a)(1)-(6).
Notice of hearing on the petition for approval must be
filed and served at least 20 days before the hearing and include all of the
following materials: (1) Prior petitions for approval (whether approved or
denied); (2) Proposed transfer agreement and disclosure form; (3) Listing of
payee's dependents and their ages; (4) Insurance Code section 10136(b)
disclosures; (5) Annuity contract (if available); (6) Qualified assignment
agreement (if available); (7) Underlying structured settlement agreement (if
available); (8) Proof of service (complying with special notice requirements); (8)
Notice to all interested parties; and (9) Notification to counsel obtaining
structured settlement (if less than 5 years ago). §§ 10139.5(f)(2)(A)-(L).
 
ANALYSIS
Section 10139.5, subdivision (b)
In assessing whether a transfer is fair, reasonable,
and in the payee’s best interest, section 10139.5, subdivision (b), requires
courts to “consider the totality of the circumstances, including, but not
limited to,” an enumerated list of factors. § 10139.5, subd. (b), ¶
(1)-(15).  
Applying the relevant factors, the Court concludes
that the transfer is fair, reasonable, and in Payee’s best interest.  
Payee seeks to transfer 9 monthly life contingent
payments of $2,246.96, commencing on 6/19/2056, and 171 monthly life contingent
payments of $2,314.37, commencing on 3/19/2057, increasing 3% annually, to Petitioner.
In exchange, Payee will receive $3,000.  
The settlement was entirely monetary and was not
intended to pay for Payee’s future medical care, treatment, or necessary living
expenses. Shepard Decl., ¶¶ 6,7. Payee does not have any court-ordered child
support obligations. Shepard Decl., ¶ 8.  
Payee has previously completed two transactions
transferring portions of her structured settlement payments. Shepard Decl., ¶¶
8,9. In 2014, through the Queens County New York Court (Case # 704173/14), Payee
transferred monthly payments of $516.06, increasing 3% every March 19th,
beginning on 1/19/2015 through and including 2/19/2040, and one lump sum
payment of $20,000.00 due on 3/19/2027 to Structured Asset Funding, LLC.
Shepard Decl., ¶  9. In 2019, through the
Kings County New York Court (Case # 516213/2019), Payee transferred life
contingent payments of $1,400.23 each, beginning on 3/19/2040 and continuing
through and including 5/19/2056, increasing 3% annually to Catalina Structured
Funding, Inc. Shepard Decl., ¶ 10. Within the past five years, Payee has not
attempted
any transactions involving her structured settlement payment that were denied,
dismissed, or withdrawn prior to a decision on the merits. Shepard Decl., ¶
11  
Payee is 37 years old, unmarried, and has a
six-year-old child who lives with her. Shepard Decl., ¶  8. Payee is currently unemployed and
experiencing financial hardship. Shepard Decl., ¶¶ 8, 12.  If approved, she intends to use the money she
receives to pay down her credit card bills. Shepard Decl., ¶ 12. 
The aggregate value of the future payments is
$505,253.55; however, payment of the full value is not guaranteed, and the full
amount will only be paid if Payee is alive in 2071. FAP at p. 2 ¶ 4. Adjusting
for the time-value of money, applying the IRS discount rate of 5.4, the
discounted present value of all future payments is $63,415.45.  FAP, Ex. B. This figure likewise assumes that
Payee will live for the full duration of the annuity.  
While the $3,000 Payee will receive is significantly
less than the total aggregate value or even the discounted present value of the
annuity, under the circumstances, the Court finds it fair, reasonable, and in
Payee’s best interest. Payee is currently experiencing financial distress and
has credit card bills that she needs to pay now, not in 32 years. According to Petitioner,
the purchase price reflects an effective interest rate of 14.15%. FAP,
Ex. B, California Disclosure Statement. The Court finds the interest rate to be
reasonable considering Petitioner’s assumption of risk that the annuity may not
be paid out in full and current economic conditions.[2]
Section 10136 Requirements
No direct or indirect transfer of structured
settlement payment rights by a payee to which Section 10136 applies shall be
effective, and no structured settlement obligor or annuity issuer shall be
required to make any payment directly or indirectly to a transferee, unless all
of the provisions of Section 10136 are satisfied. §10136, subd. (a)
First, the transfer agreement satisfies the disclosure
form requirements in section 10136, subdivision (b) because the transfer
agreement is accompanied by a disclosure addressed to Payee containing all the
statutorily required language of section 10136, subdivision (b). See FAP,
Ex. B.
Second, the transfer agreement satisfies the
transfer-agreement requirements in section 10136, subdivision (c) because the
transfer agreement contains all the necessary language required from this
statutory subdivision. See FAP, Ex. A.
Third, the transfer agreement does not violate section
10138 as none of the contents prohibited by this statutory section are
contained in the transfer agreement. See § 10136, subd. (d); see also
FAP, Ex. A. 
Fourth, Payee has not sought cancellation of the
transfer agreement as of the date of this hearing. See § 10136, subd. (e);
see also Shepard Decl., ¶ 14.
Accordingly, the Court finds that Petitioner’s
proposed transfer of Payee’s settlement rights satisfies the requirements of
section 10136, subdivisions (a) through (e).
 
 
Section 10139.5, subdivision (c)
“Every petition for approval of a transfer of
structured settlement payment rights, except as provided in subdivision (d),
shall include, to the extent known after the transferee has made reasonable
inquiry with the payee, all of the following: [¶] (1) The payee’s name,
address, and age. [¶] (2) The payee’s marital status, and, if married or
separated, the name of the payee’s spouse. [¶] (3) The names, ages, and place
or places of residence of the payee’s minor children or other dependents, if
any. (4) The amounts and sources of the payee’s monthly income and financial
resources and, if presently married, the amounts and sources of the monthly
income and financial resources of the payee’s spouse. [¶] (5) Whether the payee
is currently obligated under any child support or spousal support order…[¶] (6)
Information regarding previous transfers or attempted transfers…. § 10139.5,
subd. (c).
“[I]nformation required to be included in every
petition for approval of a transfer of structured settlement payment rights
pursuant to paragraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) of subdivision (c), … shall
be deemed to be included in the petition if it is provided at the scheduled
hearing on the proposed transfer through oral testimony or documentary evidence
filed with the court and made a part of the record consistent with the rules of
evidence and procedure.” § 10139.5, subd. (d).
Petitioner provides Payee’s name, age, and that she
lives in Long Beach, CA, in the declaration filed with the petition. Payee
Decl., at ¶ 8. However, it does not provide her address.  Likewise, her address is omitted from the
proof of service, which says, “Trisha Shepherd [Address to be provided at the
hearing] Long Beach, CA 90802.”  Unlike
the requirements in paragraphs (2) – (6), Payees’ address is not automatically deemed
to be included in the petition if it is provided at the scheduled hearing. §
10139.5, subd. (d). The Court reserves the issue of whether, at its discretion,
Petitioner should be allowed to provide Payee’s address at the hearing.  
Petitioner provides Payee’s marital status as single.
Shepard Decl., ¶ 8.  Petitioner only
provides the initials of Payee’s six-year-old child but does not provide the
name or place of residence. Ibid. They may do so at the hearing. §
10139.5, subd. (d). Petitioner provides that Payee is unemployed but does not
otherwise provide any information on her current sources of income, if any. At
the hearing, Petitioners should clarify what sources of income Payee currently
has, if any.    Petitioner provides that Payee does not have
any court-ordered child support obligations. Shepard Decl., ¶ 8.  Finally, Petitioner provides adequate
information summarizing Payees' previous transfers of payment rights.  Shepard Decl., ¶ 9-10.  
 
 
Insurance Code section 10139.5,
subdivision (f)(2)
A petitioner is required to file with the court and
serve on all interested parties notice of the proposed transfer at least twenty
days before the scheduled hearing. § 10139.5, subdivision (f)(2). Such notice
must include the documents and information specified in 10139.5, subdivision
(f)(2). The requirements and Petitioner's compliance or lack of compliance with
them are listed below:
(A) A copy of the transferee's current and any prior
petitions. Petitioner has complied. See Proof of Service. 
(B) A copy of the transfer agreement. Petitioner has
complied. FAP Ex. A.
(C) A listing of each of the Payee's dependents,
together with each dependent's age. Petitioner has complied See Shepard Decl.,
¶ 8.
(D) A copy of the disclosure required in subdivision
(b) of section 10136. Petitioner has complied. See FAP Ex.
B.
(E) A copy of the annuity contract, if available.
Petitioner has complied. See § 10139.5, subdivision (f)(2)(H) (providing
in relevant part “If a copy of a document described in subparagraph (E), (F),
or (G) is unavailable or cannot be located, then the transferee is not required
to attach a copy of that document to the petition or notice of the proposed
transfer if the transferee satisfies the court that reasonable efforts to
locate and secure a copy of the document have been made…”); see also FAP
Ex. C. (Affidavit of Trisha Shepard attesting to the contents of the annuity
contract and its unavailability.)
(F) A copy of any qualified assignment agreement, if
available. Petitioner has not complied. The settlement agreement required the
defendant’s liability insurance company, Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company, “make
an assignment for the liability of the future periodic payments to New York
Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation.” See FAP Ex. D at p. Petitioner
failed to include this agreement and does not provide any declaration as to efforts
made to locate it or its unavailability. 
(G) A copy of the underlying structured settlement
agreement, if available. Petitioner has complied. FAP Ex. D.
(I) Proof of service showing compliance with the
notification requirements of this section. See Proof of Service filed
8/27/2024.  
(J) Notification that any interested party is entitled
to support, oppose, or otherwise respond to the transferee's petition, either
in person or by counsel, by submitting written comments to the court or by
participating in the hearing. Petitioner has complied. See Notice of
Hearing, p. 2:8-10.
(K) Notification of the time and place of the hearing
and notification of the manner in which and the time by which written responses
to the petition must be filed, which may not be less than 15 days after service
of the transferee's notice, in order to be considered by the court. Petitioner
has complied. See Notice of Hearing.
Because Petitioner failed to include a copy of the
qualified assignment, it has failed to meet the notification requirements of section
10139.5, subdivision (f)(2)(G). Petitioner will have the opportunity to explain
the absence of the qualified assignment at the hearing.  
Section 10139.5(a)(1)-(6)
As required by section 10139.5(a)(1)-(6), the court
makes the following express findings:  
(1) The transfer is in the best interest of Payee,
taking into account the welfare and support of Payee’s dependents. 
(2) Payee has been advised in writing by Petitioner to
seek independent professional advice regarding the transfer and has knowingly
waived, in writing, the opportunity to receive the advice. Shepard Decl., ¶ 12;
FAP Ex. E.  
(3) Petitioner has not complied with the notification
requirements pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (f) because it failed to
include the qualified assignment agreement or explain its absence.  
(4) The transfer does not contravene any applicable
statute or the order of any court or other government authority.
(5) Payee understands the terms of the transfer
agreement, including the terms set forth in the disclosure statement required
by Section 10136. Shepard Decl., ¶ 14.  
(6) Payee understands and does not wish to exercise Payee’s
right to cancel the transfer agreement. Shepard Decl., ¶ 14.
 
CONCLUSION
As filed, the Petition is denied.  At the hearing, Petitioner will have an
opportunity to provide the Payee’s address, her child’s name, and place of
residence and to clarify what income, if any, Payee currently has. The Court
may deem the Payee’s address part of the petition at its discretion. The Court
will also hear from Petitioner about whether it took reasonable steps to find
the qualified assignment agreement.
