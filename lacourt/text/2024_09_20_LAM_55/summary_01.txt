The judge finds that the transfer is fair, reasonable, and in Payee's best interest, but notes that Petitioner failed to include a copy of the qualified assignment agreement in the notice of the proposed transfer, which is required by law. The court will hear from Petitioner at the hearing to explain the absence of the qualified assignment agreement and to provide Payee's address, child's name, and place of residence.
