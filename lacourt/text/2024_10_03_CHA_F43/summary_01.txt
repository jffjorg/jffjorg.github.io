And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is issuing a tentative ruling in a case involving Roberto Delgado, who purchased a 2021 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and is suing General Motors, LLC for violations of the Song-Beverly Act. Delgado is seeking to compel further responses to certain requests for production from General Motors. The judge notes that the parties have met and conferred, but it does not appear that they were aware of the court's Lemon Law discovery order at the time. The judge orders the parties to meet and confer again based on the discovery order and to file a joint statement of remaining issues. The statement should describe the matters in dispute, followed by the parties' arguments. The judge also reminds the parties to review the court's discovery order, which is posted online, and to refer to it for guidance on the production of documents.
