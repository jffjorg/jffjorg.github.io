And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel responses to its Form Interrogatories. The defendant, Income Tax Solutions, failed to respond to the plaintiff's request for information. The plaintiff filed suit against the defendant for violating the Immigration Consultant Act. The defendant did not oppose the plaintiff's motion, and therefore has not provided a substantial justification for its failure to respond. As a result, the judge sanctions the defendant and its counsel $700 for their failure to comply with the plaintiff's request.
