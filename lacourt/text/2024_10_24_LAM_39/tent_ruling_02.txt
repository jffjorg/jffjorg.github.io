Motion to Compel Further Discovery Responses

OPPOSING PARTIES


Defendant Pitzer College



 
MOTION
Plaintiff Brendan
Schultz (“Plaintiff”) moves to compel further responses from Defendant Pitzer
College (“Defendant”) to Special Interrogatories, set one (“SROG”).  Defendant opposes the motion.
ANALYSIS
If the propounding
party deems responses to interrogatories unsatisfactory, the propounding party
may move to compel further responses. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300.)
Defendant’s
responses to the SROG consist only of objections.  As Plaintiff timely filed this motion to
compel further responses, Defendant has the burden to justify its objections.  (Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255.)  Defendant
has not done so.  Defendant’s objections
are general and boilerplate.  As such,
the Court compels Defendant to further respond to the discovery at issue.  (Best Products, Inc. v. Superior Court
(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1181, 1189.)  
In opposition, Defendant argues the SROG
assume facts not in evidence.  That is
irrelevant.  (See West Pico Furniture
Company of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (1961) 56 Cal.2d 407, 421 (West
Pico) [objections to form of the question may be appropriate at depositions
but not for other manner of discovery].) 
Likewise, Defendant’s objections that the SROG are vague and ambiguous
are inapplicable because such objections cannot “justify a complete failure to
comply.”  (Standon Co., Inc. v.
Superior Court (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 898, 901.)  Even if Defendant had difficulty
understanding Plaintiff’s SROG, Defendant, nonetheless, must respond to the
extent possible. 
Defendant cites Calcor Space Facility,
Inc. v. Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216 (Calcor Space) in
support of its argument Plaintiff must advance evidence to show the SROG are
relevant to this case.  Calcor Space stands
for no such proposition.  In that case,
the Court of Appeal held a party seeking to compel a nonlitigant business to
produce all documents in its possession with any connection to a product
category must provide a specific justification “for imposing this great burden”
on a nonlitigant.  (Id., at p. 224.)  Defendant is a party in this action.  As a party, if Defendant contends the
discovery is unduly burdensome on Defendant, Defendant is required to produce evidence
of “the quantum of work required” and show “the ultimate effect of the
burden is incommensurate with the result sought.”  (West Pico, supra, 56
Cal.2d at p. 417.)  This would include providing
evidence of “the total man hours required to accomplish  the task.” (Ibid.)  Defendant fails to advance such evidence.
Therefore, the motion is granted, and Defendant
is to provide further responses to Plaintiff’s SROG, without objections, within
30 days of this order.
Plaintiff is to give notice of this order and
to file proof of service of same.
