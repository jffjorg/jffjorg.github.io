And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel further discovery responses from Pitzer College, the defendant, in response to special interrogatories proposed by Brendan Schultz, the plaintiff. The defendant's responses were limited to objections, which the judge finds to be general and boilerplate. The judge rules that the defendant must provide further responses to the interrogatories, without objections, within 30 days of the order. The judge also notes that the defendant failed to provide evidence to support its objections and did not demonstrate that the discovery was unduly burdensome.
