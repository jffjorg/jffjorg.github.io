And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion filed by Fidelity National Title Insurance Company (Plaintiff) to deem admitted matters specified in Requests for Admissions (RFA) served on Defendant Peter Mullins. Since Defendant failed to respond to the RFA, the Judge granted the motion and deemed the matters specified in the RFA to be admitted. The Judge also imposed sanctions against Defendant in the amount of $900, which represents three hours of counsel's time to prepare the motion and attend the hearing, due to Defendant's failure to respond to the RFA and provide an explanation for such failure. The Judge ordered Defendant to pay the sanctions to Plaintiff within 30 days.
