Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained Pitzer College's demurrer to Brendan Schultz's First Amended Complaint, which means that Schultz's claims against Pitzer College are dismissed. The judge has given Schultz the opportunity to amend his complaint to state viable claims against Pitzer College, but has also warned him that leave to amend may be futile.

The judge has also denied Pitzer College's motion to strike portions of Schultz's complaint, as the demurrer has already rendered the motion moot.

The judge has found that Schultz has failed to state claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, breach of contract, and fraud. The judge has also found that Schultz has failed to allege facts to support his claims for punitive damages, attorney fees, or restitution.

The judge has ordered Pitzer College to give notice of this order and to file proof of service of the same. The judge has given Schultz 10 days to file an amended complaint.
