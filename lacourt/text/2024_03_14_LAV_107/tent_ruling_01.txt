COURT’S [TENTATIVE]
  RULING: MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT 
 


[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING]I. BACKGROUND
 
On December 19, 2019, plaintiff
Chloe Manavi (“Plaintiff”) had her wisdom teeth extracted by defendant Fariborz
Matian, D.D.S. (“Dr. Matian”), during which procedure Plaintiff incurred nerve
injuries that later required subsequent surgery to correct. (Complaint p. 3.)
 
On July 21, 2022, Plaintiff
initiated this lawsuit by filing a complaint (the “Complaint”) alleging causes
of action for medical malpractice and medical battery against Dr. Matian and
Fariborz Matian D.D.S., Inc. (“Dr. Matian Inc.” and, together with Dr. Matian,
“Defendants” and Defendants, together with Plaintiff, “Parties”).
 
On October 9, 2023, Defendants
filed the instant motion (the “Motion”) for summary judgment. On March 1, 2024,
filed an opposition (the “Opposition”) to the Motion, and on March 8, 2024,
Defendants replied to the Opposition (by filing the “Reply”).
 
II. PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS
            
A. The Motion
 
Defendants contend that
Plaintiff’s lawsuit is barred by the statute of limitations under Code of Civil
Procedure § 340.5. (Motion p. 1.) Defendants argue that this action is governed
by a one-year statute of limitations for medical malpractice cases, which
begins to run when “a reasonable person [has] suspicion that he or she has been
injured and his or her injury was a result of negligence.” (Id. at p.
7.) Defendants observe that Code of Civil Procedure § 364(a) tolls this
one-year statute of limitations for 90 days when notice of intent to sue is
served within 90 days of the expiration of the statute of limitations and that
Emergency Rule 9 tolled statutes of limitations between April 6, 2020 and
October 1, 2020. (Id. at pp. 8–9.) Defendants then propose three dates
by which Plaintiff’s cause of action against them accrued, all of which would
cause the statute of limitations to expire before the filing of the Complaint.
(Id. at pp. 9–12.) 
 
B. The Opposition
 
Plaintiff argues that there
remain triable issues of material fact, making summary judgment inappropriate.
(Opposition p. 6.) Plaintiff argues that the statute of limitations is tolled
by the discovery rule in medical cases “if there is continuing treatment and
the patient does not suspect that the doctor was negligent.” (Id. at pp.
6–8.) Plaintiff contends that she relied on Dr. Matian’s medical judgment that
no negligence has occurred until a doctor suggested otherwise to her. (Id.
at p. 8.)
 
C. The Reply
 
Defendants
observe that the Opposition was untimely and contends that the Opposition does
not attach any admissible evidence. (Reply pp. 1–4.) Defendants argue that a
case relied upon in the Opposition for the proposition that a plaintiff may
rely on a doctor’s medical judgment, Kitzig v. Nordquist (2000) 81
Cal.App.4th 1384, is distinguishable because Plaintiff did not seek continued
care from Dr. Matian after the surgery in which she incurred her injuries. (Id.
at pp. 4–5.) Finally, Defendants point out that the Opposition does not address
all the Motion’s arguments or contradict all of the facts it puts forward. (Id.
at pp. 4–6.)
 
III. TIMELINESS
 
A
motion for summary judgment “may be made at any time after 60 days have elapsed
since the general appearance in the action or proceeding of each party against
whom the motion is directed or at any earlier time after the general appearance
that the court, with or without notice and upon good cause shown, may direct.”
(Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd. (a).) “Notice of the motion and
supporting papers shall be served on all other parties to the action at least
75 days before the time appointed for hearing” with additional days depending
on how the notice is served. (Ibid.) “The motion shall be heard no later
than 30 days before the date of trial, unless the court for good cause orders
otherwise.” (Ibid.) “An opposition to the motion shall be served and
filed not less than 14 days preceding the noticed or continued date of hearing,
unless the court for good cause orders otherwise” and “[a] reply to the
opposition shall be served and filed by the moving party not less than five
days preceding the noticed or continued date of hearing, unless the court for
good cause orders otherwise. (Id. at subd. (b).) 
 
“A
trial court has broad discretion under rule
3.1300(d) of the California Rules of Court to refuse to consider papers
served and filed beyond the deadline without a prior court order finding good
cause for late submission.” (Bozzi v. Nordstrom, Inc. (2010) 186
Cal.App.4th 755, 765.) Similarly, courts have wide latitude to grant
continuances.
 
Here,
Plaintiff appeared in this lawsuit by filing the Complaint more than 60 days
prior to the filing of the Motion. Notice of the Motion was served via e-mail
on October 9, 2023, which is more than 75 days before it is set for hearing.
Fourteen days before the hearing was February 29, 2024. Five days before the
hearing was March 9, 2024. Thus, the Motion was timely, the Opposition was
untimely, and the Reply was timely. Given that Defendants were able to
thoroughly prepare and file their Reply in a timely manner, we decline to
strike the Opposition for being untimely in this instance.
 
IV. ANALYSIS 
 
A. The Request for Judicial Notice
 
“Judicial notice is the recognition and
acceptance by the court, for use by the trier of fact or by the court, of the
existence of a matter of law or fact that is relevant to an issue in the action
without requiring formal proof of the matter.” (Unruh-Haxton v. Regents of
University of California (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 343, 364.)
“Judicial notice may not be taken of any matter unless authorized or
required by law.” (Cal. Evid. C. § 450.) Matters subject
to judicial notice are listed in Cal. Evid. C. §§ 451–452.
(Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 97, 113.) “The underlying theory
of judicial notice is that the matter
being judicially noticed is a law or fact that is not
reasonably subject to dispute.” (Lockley v. Law Office of
Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875,
882 (emphasis original).) “Although the existence of a
document may be judicially noticeable, the truth of statements
contained in the document and its proper interpretation are not subject
to judicial notice if those matters are reasonably disputable.”
(Fremont Indemnity Co. v. Fremont General Corp., supra, 113
(emphasis original); Tenet Healthsystem Desert, Inc. v. Blue Cross of
California (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 821, 836.)
 
Defendants request judicial
notice of four documents: (1) the Complaint, (2) Plaintiff’s First Amended
Complaint, (3) Defendants’ Answer to the First Amended Complaint, and (4)
California Rules of Court, Appendix I: Emergency Rules Related to COVID-19. (Request
for Judicial Notice pp. 1–2.)
 
First, we note that “[s]trictly speaking, a court
takes judicial notice of facts, not documents.” (Fontenot v. Wells Fargo
Bank, N.A., supra, 265.) Second, we note that judicial notice may
be taken of the “[r]ecords of… any court of this state” and of “[r]ules of
court of… any court of this state.” (Cal. Evid. Code § 452, subd.
(d)–(e).) Further, judicial notice shall be taken of any matter in Cal.
Evid. Code § 452 requested by a party if the adverse party is given
sufficient notice and the court is furnished with sufficient information to
enable it to take judicial notice of the matter. (Cal. Evid. Code § 453.) 
 
The first three documents of which judicial notice is
sought are records of this court and the fourth constitutes rules of this
court. Defendants filed their request for judicial notice with the Motion ahead
of the hearing and attached to the request copies of the four documents. We
thus believe that Plaintiff had adequate notice and that we have been furnished
with sufficient information to take judicial notice of this matter.
 
Accordingly, this court GRANTS the request for
judicial notice of the existence of the four documents, though not of the truth
of the matters stated therein.
 
            B. Evidentiary Objections
 
            In support of the Motion, Defendants attach discovery
responses, including deposition transcripts, which are authenticated by signed
declarations claiming personal knowledge as to the matters stated therein. (See
Finn Decl. pp. 1–2.) In opposition, Plaintiff attaches an unsigned declaration
by her attorney, her own declaration, which is not under penalty of perjury
pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 2015.5, and deposition transcripts,
which are not authenticated. (See Plaintiff’s Separate Statement Exh. A–E.) We
note that none of Plaintiff’s attached evidence is admissible. Defendants
contend that “[w]ithout admissible evidence, Plaintiff cannot create a
trial issue of material fact.” (Reply p. 4, emphasis added.) Defendants cite Taylor
v. Financial Casualty & Surety, Inc. (2021) 67 Cal.App.5th 966, 994
(hereafter, Taylor) in support of this contention. (Ibid.)
Although Defendants cite Taylor for its statement that “Plaintiffs'
evidence must be admissible to create a triable issue,” Taylor also
states that “a party may not raise a triable issue of fact by relying on
evidence that will not be admissible at trial.” (Taylor, supra
at 979, 994, emphasis added.) Taylor continues, “[w]e liberally construe the
evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts
concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Id. at 980.) All of
Plaintiff’s attached evidence is inadmissible because it is procedurally
defective as attached to the Opposition, on which we do not believe the outcome
of this Motion, and therefore Plaintiff’s lawsuit, should hinge. We are
satisfied that these procedural problems, such as the missing signature on the
Javaherian Declaration or the missing penalty of perjury oath on Plaintiff’s
Declaration, could be cured before trial and Plaintiff has adequately
demonstrated an ability to produce admissible evidence before trial. However,
even considering this evidence, the outcome is still the same. 
 
C. The Motion for Summary Judgment
 
“A party may move for summary
judgment in an action or proceeding if it is contended that the
action has no merit or that there is no defense to the action or proceeding.” (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd.
(a)(1).) The function of a motion for summary judgment or adjudication
is to allow a determination as to whether an opposing party can show
evidentiary support for a pleading or claim and, if not, to enable an order of
summary dismissal without the need for trial. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield
Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure § 437c, subdivision (c) “requires
the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and
‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by
other inferences or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of
law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110,
1119.) “A triable issue of material fact exists where ‘the evidence would
allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the
party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of
proof.’” (California Medical Assn. v. Aetna Health of California Inc.
(2021) 63 Cal.App.5th 660, 665, quoting Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.,
supra at 850.) 
 
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the moving party must satisfy the initial burden of proof by
presenting facts to negate an essential element or to establish a defense.
(Code Civ. Proc, § 437c, subd. (p)(2).) A cause of action “cannot be established”
if the undisputed facts presented by defendant prove the contrary of
plaintiff's allegations¿as a matter of law. (Brantley v. Pisaro (1996)
42 Cal.App.4th 1591, 1597.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support
of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the
evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc.¿(2006)
39 Cal.4th 384, 389.) Once the moving party has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the opposing party to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto. To
establish a triable issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must
produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68
Cal.App.4th 151, 166.) 
 
“Resolution of the statute of
limitations issue is normally a question of fact.” (Fox v.
Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 810.) “Generally
speaking, a cause of action accrues at “the time when the cause of action is
complete with all of its elements. An important exception to the general rule
of accrual is the ‘discovery rule,’ which postpones accrual of a cause of
action until the plaintiff discovers, or has reason to discover, the cause of
action.” (Id. at 806–07.) “[T]he accrual date of a cause of
action is delayed until the plaintiff is aware of her injury and
its negligent cause.” (Jolly v. Eli Lilly & Co. (1988) 44
Cal.3d 1103, 1109.) “Under the discovery rule, suspicion of one or
more of the elements of a cause of action, coupled with knowledge of any
remaining elements, will generally trigger the statute of limitations period.”
(Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., supra at 807.) "A
plaintiff is held to her actual knowledge as well as knowledge that could
reasonably be discovered through investigation of sources open to her." (Jolly
v. Eli Lilly & Co. (1988) 44 Cal.3d 1103, 1110.) "Under the
discovery rule, the statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff
suspects or should suspect that her injury was caused by wrongdoing, that
someone has done something wrong to her." (Ibid.) "'The question of
when there has been a belated discovery of the cause of action, especially in
malpractice cases, is essentially a question of fact,' and 'it is only where
reasonable minds can draw but one conclusion from the evidence that the question
becomes a matter of matter of law.' [Citation.]" (Drexler v. Petersen
(2016) 4 Cal.App.5th 1181, 1189.)
 
Here, Parties dispute when
Plaintiff’s causes of action for medical malpractice and medical battery
accrued because they disagree as to when Plaintiff suspected that her injury
was caused by Dr. Matian’s negligence. As explained above, according to the
Motion, the Defendant suggests three options: Option #1-- December 26, 2019 for
accrual, which is a week after the alleged date of the extraction of Plaintiff’s
wisdom teeth ( December 19, 2019) and when Plaintiff had actual suspicion, or a
reasonable person would have suspected, that she had been injured due to the
alleged negligence of Defendant; Option #2 -- March 24, 2020, as a second proffered
date, accruing when Plaintiff underwent the lingual nerve reconstruction surgery
by Earl Freymiller, D.M.D. (“Dr. Freymiller”); or Option  #3 -- March 22, 2021, the date of Plaintiff’s
final appointment with Dr. Freymiller on March 22, 2021, at which time there
was still no improvement to the numbness on the left side of Plaintiff tongue. Therefore,
the Defendant argues: “Utilizing the December 26, 2019 or March 24, 2020 dates
of accrual, and taking into consideration the approximate six-month tolling of
the statute of limitations provided by the COVID-19 Emergency Rules of Court
during the period from April 6, 2020 until October 1,2020,Plaintiff had until
May 26, 2021 (one year and six months after December 26, 2019) or September 24,
2021 (one year and six months after March 24, 2020) to file this lawsuit. She missed
those deadlines by nearly 14 and 10 months, respectively. Conversely, providing
Plaintiff the benefit of the one-year that she continued to be followed by Dr.
Freymiller (i.e., until March 22, 2021) as to the date of accrual, Plaintiff
had until March 22, 2022 to file this lawsuit. She missed that deadline by
almost four months.” (Id. at pages 1 and 2.)
 
The Plaintiff argues that the
date of accrual is much later because of the application of the “discovery rule.”
Specifically, she states that she did not suspect that her tongue dysfunction
was potentially caused by any negligence by Dr. Matian until she saw Dr. Mark
Yafai on April 12, 2022. According to the Plaintiff, during that appointment he
informed her that Dr. Matian negligently performed her extraction which was a
cause of her tongue dysfunction. Up until her appointment with Dr. Yafai, it
was her belief that her tongue dysfunction was not caused by any medical
negligence. (See
Plaintiff’s Declaration ¶6, Plaintiff’s Deposition at 51:1-52:1, 77:3-6, and
79:18-25.) Therefore, according to the plaintiff, the date of accrual is April
12, 2022.
 
The following facts are undisputed: According to the
Plaintiff’s Separate Statement of Disputed Material Facts ("DMF") 2-21,
these facts are undisputed: On December 19, 2019, Dr. Matian extracted
Plaintiff’s four wisdom teeth. (See ¶ 10 of Plaintiff’s Complaint; see ¶ 10 of
Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint.) Upon the completion of the extraction of
her four wisdom teeth and awakening from the sedation that had been
administered, the left side of Plaintiff’s tongue was numb. (See Plaintiff’s
Deposition at 35:16-36:11.) Plaintiff never returned to see Dr. Matian after
December 19, 2019. (See Plaintiff’s Deposition at 43:21-25, 56:14- 20, and
67:8-16.) On December 26, 2019, Plaintiff went to see oral surgeon Shaun
Daneshgar, D.M.M. (“Dr. Daneshgar”), as Plaintiff was concerned because she was
continuing to experience the numbness on the left side of her tongue. (See
Plaintiff’s Deposition at 44:1-23, 46:7-11, and 52:5-12.) Dr. Daneshgar
prescribed her steroids because the numbness she was experiencing on the left
side of her tongue could have been due to inflammation from the extraction of
her wisdom teeth by Dr. Matian. (See Plaintiff’s Deposition at 52:16-23.) Plaintiff
took the steroids that she said were prescribed by Dr. Daneshgar, but the
steroids did not help improve the numbness she was experiencing on the left
side of her tongue. (See Plaintiff’s Deposition at 56:3-13.) Plaintiff filled
out a Health Questionnaire for UCLA Dental Clinics that she dated and signed on
March 6, 2020. (See Plaintiff’s Deposition at 61:19-62:9). The Health
Questionnaire for UCLA Dental Clinics that Plaintiff dated and signed on March
6, 2020 asked Plaintiff to identify the “Major dental problem or reason for
coming to the UCLA Dental Center,” to which Plaintiff handwrote: “Left side of
my tongue due to wisdom teeth extraction.” (See Plaintiff’s Deposition at
62:13-63:6) On March 24, 2020 (or March 25, 2020, per Plaintiff’s
recollection), Dr. Freymiller performed on Plaintiff a left lingual nerve reconstruction
with allogenic nerve graft surgery. (See Plaintiff’s Deposition at 71:12-19;
Dr. Freymiller’s Deposition at 42:22-43:2 and 44:13-22.). Plaintiff’s last
appointment with Dr. Freymiller was on March 22, 2021. (See Plaintiff’s
Deposition at 75:4-12; Dr. Freymiller’s Deposition at 56:2-5 and 57:7-19.) As
of Plaintiff’s last appointment with Dr. Freymiller on March 22, 2021, the
numbness on the left side of her tongue had not improved. (See Plaintiff’s
Deposition at 73:24-74:19; Dr. Freymiller’s Deposition at 56:9-21.) Other than
Dr. Freymiller, Plaintiff did not see any health care providers for the
numbness on the left side of her tongue during the year between when Dr.
Freymiller performed the lingual nerve surgery and Plaintiff’s one-year
post-operative appointment with Dr. Freymiller on March 22, 2021. (See
Plaintiff’s Deposition at 75:4-9.) On April 12, 2022, Plaintiff was seen by
oral surgeon Mark Yafai, D.D.S., M.D. (“Dr. Yafai”). (See Dre. Yafai’s
Deposition at 7:16-8:5.) Plaintiff testified that it was Dr. Yafai who first
introduced the idea that “something happened” and her “nerve was probably severely
damaged” (i.e., “cut”) during the extraction of her wisdom teeth. (See
Plaintiff’s Deposition at 51:1-52:1, 77:3-6, and 79:18-25) Plaintiff served Dr.
Matian with her “Notice of Intent to Commence Action Against Health Care
Provider” on May 6, 2022. (See ¶ 3 and Exhibit 1 to Dr. Matian’s Declaration.) Plaintiff’s
Complaint was filed on July 21, 2022. (See Plaintiff’s Complaint.) 
 
The parties dispute the import, but not the existence, of the
fact that Plaintiff stated at her deposition that, as of the time she went to
see Dr. Daneshgar on December 26, 2019, she thought Dr. Matian had done
something wrong during the extractions (see Plaintiff’s Deposition at
45:21-46:3 and 46:12-16) and that Plaintiff also stated at her deposition: “I
saw a lot of doctors at that time. I don’t remember when I had made the
distinction in my mind that something actually did go wrong during the surgery”
(See Plaintiff’s Deposition at 47:20-25 and 52:16-53:9.)
 
The
Court finds that these facts show Plaintiff suspected wrongdoing, or certainly
had reason to suspect wrongdoing, as early as when she stated in the Health Questionnaire for UCLA Dental Clinics, dated
and signed on March 6, 2020, “Left side of my tongue due to wisdom teeth
extraction.” (See Plaintiff’s Deposition at 62:13-63:6.) Additionally, Plaintiff
suspected wrongdoing, or certainly had reason to suspect wrongdoing, at her
last appointment with Dr. Freymiller on March 22, 2021, at the latest. 
 
Defendant has met his burden of proof that plaintiff could have discovered,
or might have had notice of circumstances which would have put a
reasonable person on inquiry (i.e., she should have discovered), that her
injury occurred sometime between December 26, 2019 and March 22, 2021. A
reasonable inference could be drawn from the evidence that the plaintiff
discovered, or should have discovered, her injuries --the traumatic and painful
experience which required surgery on March 24, 2020.
 
Plaintiff's citation
to Kitzig v. Nordquist, supra, is not persuasive.  In Kitzig the Court stated: “A finding
that Kitzig was required to bring suit under these circumstances is
inconsistent with the accepted practice of obtaining a second opinion during
ongoing medical treatment. Holding that seeking a second opinion necessarily
triggers a malpractice statute of limitations whenever a patient is motivated
by a possible suspicion--however momentary--that her doctor was "doing
something wrong" would hinder a patient's ability to obtain the best
medical care. Kitzig v. Nordquist, 81 Cal. App. 4th 1384, 1393. In this
case, the facts are much different. First, the Plaintiff did not obtain a
second opinion while “under the care” of Dr. Matian, as his care of the
plaintiff did not continue after the December 19,2019 treatment date. Additionally,
there is no evidence in this case that any other treatment provider told her
that Dr. Matian was "doing nothing wrong.” Instead, the plaintiff had complications
for months and that they required her to have surgery on March 24, 2020. On this
set of facts, reasonable minds can
draw but one conclusion from the evidence. Drexler v. Petersen (2016) 4
Cal.App.5th 1181, 1189.)
The Court finds that under this set of facts, Plaintiff not only subjectively
knew of the defendant's wrongdoing, but that it was objectively known as well. 
 
Accordingly,
the court finds that the Defendant has satisfied
his initial burden of proof for purposes of the Motion by presenting facts
supported by attached evidence to establish that Plaintiff’s causes of action
accrued early enough to have been barred by the statute of limitations by the
time she filed the Complaint, and defendant is entitled to
summary judgment. (CCP §437c(p)(2).) Thus, the burden shifts to plaintiff to
show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause
of action. (CCP §437c(p)(2).) The plaintiff has not carried this burden as
explained above. 
 
 
Accordingly,
this court GRANTS the Motion.
