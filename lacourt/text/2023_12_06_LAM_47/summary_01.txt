And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Attorney Christopher L. Hoglin, counsel for Defendant Miguel Melgoza, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, as Defendant has ceased communicating with Moving Counsel entirely. Despite the risk of prejudice to Defendant due to the proximity of trial, the court finds that it would not serve any purpose to force Moving Counsel to continue representing a client at trial when that client is no longer communicating with his counsel. The court has exercised its discretion reasonably and granted the motion, conditioned on Moving Counsel serving notice on all parties within 10 days of this order.
