STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for partition of a parcel of real property and for
fraud, conversion, and breach of fiduciary duty. Plaintiff alleges that
Defendant induced him to loan money for the purchase of the property to operate
it as a dispensary. 
 
Attorney Christopher L. Hoglin,
counsel for Defendant Miguel Melgoza, moves to be relieved as counsel. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Christopher L. Hoglin,
counsel for Defendant Miguel Melgoza, moves to be relieved as counsel. 
 
Moving counsel filed all three required forms (MC-051,
-052, and -053) and included a proof of service as required by California Rules
of Court rule 3.1362(d).  Moving counsel’s
declaration states that he served Defendant by mail at his last known address
but could not confirm the address was current beyond a person locator search
via LexisNexis showing Defendant is still at his last known address. (MC-052 ¶
3.) 
 
In general, an attorney may withdraw with
or without cause as long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice
to the client’s interest – i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in
the litigation, because that would prejudice client, but can withdraw
otherwise. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904,
915.) The court has discretion to deny an attorney’s request to withdraw where
the withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in the proceeding,
but the court’s discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably. (Mandell
v. Superior Court (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)   
 
Here, the matter set for trial on January
23, 2024 at 10:00 AM. (MC-052 ¶ 6.) The next hearing on calendar is a
Post-Mediation Status Conference set for the same date and time as this motion,
followed by a Final Status Conference on January 8, 2024 at 9:00 AM. (MC-052 ¶
4.). There is a high risk of prejudice to Defendant due to the relative
proximity of trial. Moving Counsel’s declaration states, however, that he is no
longer able to represent Defendant due to a breakdown in the attorney-client
relationship in that Defendant has ceased communicating with Moving Counsel
entirely.  (MC-052 ¶ 2.) Despite the risk
of prejudice to Defendant, no purpose would be served by forcing Moving Counsel
to continue to represent a client at trial when that client is no longer
communicating with his counsel. The Court therefore finds that the
circumstances of this case warrant withdrawal. 
 
            Accordingly,
Attorney Christopher L. Hoglin’s Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel for Defendant
Miguel Melgoza is GRANTED, conditioned on Moving Counsel serving notice on all
parties within 10 days of this order. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
