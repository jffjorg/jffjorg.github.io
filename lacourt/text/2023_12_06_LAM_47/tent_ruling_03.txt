STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for wrongful foreclosure on a property located at 82 W.
Abor Street, Long Beach, CA 90805. 
 
Attorney Tony Cara, counsel for
Plaintiff, moves to be relieved as counsel. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Tony Cara, counsel for
Plaintiff, moves to be relieved as counsel. 
 
Moving counsel filed all three required forms (MC-051,
-052, and -053) and included a proof of service as required by California Rules
of Court rule 3.1362(d).  Moving counsel’s
declaration states that he served Plaintiff by mail and confirmed the address
is current by way of mail, return receipt requested. (MC-052 ¶ 3.) 
 
In general, an attorney may withdraw with
or without cause as long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice
to the client’s interest – i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in
the litigation, because that would prejudice client, but can withdraw
otherwise. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904,
915.) The court has discretion to deny an attorney’s request to withdraw where
the withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in the proceeding,
but the court’s discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably. (Mandell
v. Superior Court (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)   
 
Here, the matter is set for trial on May
7, 2024. (MC-052 ¶ 6.) The next hearing on calendar is a Post-Mediation Status
Conference set for February 8, 2024, at 8:30 AM There is also a Motion for
Judgment on the Pleadings scheduled for April 3, 2024, at 9:00 AM, and a Final
Status Conference set for April 22, 2024, at 9:00 AM. Moving Counsel’s
declaration states that he is no longer able to represent Plaintiff due to a
breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. 
(MC-052 ¶ 2.) Considering that trial is set to occur about five months
from now and the only pending motion will not be heard until early April 2024,
there is little risk of prejudice to the Plaintiff. Moreover, in light of the
breakdown of the attorney-client relationship, the Court finds these
circumstances warrant permitting withdrawal.
 
            Accordingly,
Attorney Tony Cara’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff is GRANTED,
contingent on Moving Counsel serving notice on all parties within 10 days of
this order. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
