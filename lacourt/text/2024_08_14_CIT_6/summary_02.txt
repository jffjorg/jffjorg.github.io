And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying non-party Zeming Qi's motion to quash a deposition subpoena and/or for a protective order. The motion was filed in connection with a subpoena served on Bank of America. The judge found that Qi's motion was unpersuasive because Qi does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the bank records of a corporation, and Qi's declaration fails to comply with California law. The judge also found that Qi has not presented evidence that the subpoenaed documents contain proprietary or financial information that would violate Qi's privacy rights. The judge ordered the plaintiff to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of the order.
