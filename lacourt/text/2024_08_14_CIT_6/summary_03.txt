And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied without prejudice the Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment. The Plaintiff, United Financial Casualty Company, filed a subrogation action against the Defendant, Joseph D. Molina, alleging a motor vehicle cause of action. The Plaintiff submitted a default judgment package, but the Judge found two issues with the package. First, the Plaintiff did not submit a proposed judgment as required by the California Rules of Court. Second, the Judge requested further evidence from the Plaintiff showing the amount paid to its insured, Stephen Romero. Although liability is admitted on default, proof is still required to support the damages requested. The Judge will not grant default judgment at this time, and the Plaintiff may resubmit its request with the required evidence.
