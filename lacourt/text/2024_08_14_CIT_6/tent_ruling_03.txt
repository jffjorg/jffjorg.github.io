 Case Number:  24PSCV00258    Hearing Date:   August 14, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff  United Financial Casualty’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment  Defendant: Joseph D. Molina  TENTATIVE RULING              Plaintiff’s  request for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.            BACKGROUND                        This  is a subrogation action. On January 25, 2024, plaintiff United Financial  Casualty Company (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Joseph D.  Molina (Defendant) and Does 1 to 20, alleging the sole cause of action for  motor vehicle.              On  June 6, 2024, Plaintiff submitted a request for entry of default and default  judgment. Default was entered on the same date. On June 25, 2024, Plaintiff  submitted the remainder of Plaintiff’s default judgment package.      LEGAL  STANDARD  Code of  Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party  has failed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party  seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court  Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other  admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest  computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) declaration  of nonmilitary status; (6) a proposed form of judgment; (7) a dismissal of all  parties against whom judgment is not sought or an application for separate  judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of  grounds for each judgment; (8) exhibits as necessary; and (9) a request for  attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal.  Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.)  ANALYSIS  Plaintiff  seeks default judgment against Defendants in the total amount of $104,029.00,  including $103,500.00 in damages and $529.00 in costs. The Court finds two  issues with the default judgment package. First, Plaintiff did not submit a  proposed judgment per Rule 3.1800, subdivision (a)(6), of the California Rules  of Court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800, subd. (a)(6).) Second, the Court  requests Plaintiff to provide further evidence from Plaintiff itself showing  the amount it paid to its insured, Stephen Romero. (See Id., 3.1800,  subds. (a)(2), (a)(8); Code Civ. Proc., § 585, subd. (b) [“the court shall hear the  evidence offered by the plaintiff and shall render judgment in the plaintiff’s  favor for that relief, not exceeding the amount stated in the complaint… as  appears by the evidence to be just.”]; see also Cal. Rules of Court, rule  3.1800, subd. (8) [plaintiff must provide exhibits as necessary].) While  liability is admitted on default, proof is still required to support the  damages requested. (Carlsen v. Koivumaki (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 879,  898.)  CONCLUSION                          Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s request  for entry of default judgment is DENIED without prejudice.
