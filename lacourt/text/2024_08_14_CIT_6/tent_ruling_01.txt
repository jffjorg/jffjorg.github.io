BACKGROUND 
This is a case involving abuse of a minor. On January
20, 2021, plaintiff D.C. (Claimant), a person with a disability, by and through
him [sic] guardian ad litem, Olivia C. (Petitioner), filed this action against
defendants West Covina Unified School district, Canyon View School, McKinley
Children’s Center, Inc. (McKinley), East San Gabriel Special Education Local
Planning Area, John Mann, Jeannie Ortiz, Jennifer Miller, Jorge Ramirez,
Yolanda Cork-Anthony, Diana Marie Casato and Does 1 through 50, alleging causes
of action for negligence, Ralph Act Violation, Bane Act Violation, Unruh Act
Violation. On February 3, 2021, the Court approved Petitioner’s application and
order for appointment as guardian ad litem for Claimant. 
On April 15, 2024, Claimant filed a notice of
settlement. On July 24, 2024, Olivia Chambers, i.e., Petitioner, filed a petition
for approval of compromise of claim or action or disposition of proceeds of
judgment for minor or person with disability on behalf of Claimant. The
petition is unopposed. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Court approval is required for all settlements of a
minor's claim or that of a person lacking the capacity to make decisions.
(Prob. Code, §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372; see Pearson
v. Superior Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1337.) "[T]he
protective role the court generally assumes in cases involving minors, [is] a
role to assure that whatever is done is in the minor's best interests . . . .
[I]ts primary concern is whether the compromise is sufficient to provide for
the minor's injuries, care and treatment." (Goldberg v. Superior Court
(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1378, 1382.) The same protection applies for a disabled
person.
A petition for court approval of a compromise under
Code of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court
Rules 7.950, 7.951, and 7.952. The petition must be verified by the petitioner
and contain a full disclosure of all information that has "any bearing
upon the reasonableness" of the compromise or the covenant. (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 7.950.) The person compromising the claim on behalf of the person
who lacks capacity, and the represented person, must attend the hearing on
compromise of the claim unless the court for good cause dispenses with their
personal appearance. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.952(a).) An order for deposit
of funds of a minor or person lacking decision-making capacity and a petition
for the withdrawal of such funds must comply with California Rules of Court
Rules 7.953 and 7.954. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1384; see also Super. Ct.
L.A. County, Local Rules, rules 4.115-4.118.)
Form MC-350 (Rev. January 1, 2021):
The petition has been verified by Petitioner and
presented on a fully completed mandatory Judicial Council Form MC-350, using
the current January 1, 2021 revision. (Cal. Rule of Court Rule 7.950.)
 
DISCUSSION 
Settlement 
Claimant has agreed
to settle his claims with McKinley in exchange for $800,000.00, $375,520.24 of which will go to Claimant.
If approved, $320,000.00 will be paid in attorney’s fees, $64,479.76 will be
paid for reimbursement of litigation costs advanced by Claimant’s attorneys, and
$40,000.00 will paid to Medi-Cal for medical expenses, leaving a balance of $375,520.24
for Claimant, to be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity, subject to
withdrawal only on authorization of the Court. 
Court approval is required for
all settlements of a person with a disability. (Probate Code, §§ 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) The
Court has reviewed the proposed settlement and finds the Petition contains a
full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness
of the settlement amount to Claimant and that the settlement amount to Claimant
is reasonable given Claimant's injuries and the medical expenses incurred. 
Attorney's Fees 
The retained attorney's information has been disclosed as
required by Rule of Court 7.951. (Petition ¶ 17b.) There is an agreement for
services provided in connection with the underlying claim. (Petition ¶ 17a(2).)
Copies of the agreements were submitted with the Petition as strictly required
by Rule of Court 7.951(6). (Attach. 17a.) 
Petitioner’s counsel is seeking
to recover $320,000.00 in attorney's fees. (Petition ¶13a, Attach. 13a.)
Counsel has provided a declaration addressing the reasonableness of the fee
request, as required by Rule of Court 7,995(c), accounting for the factors
specified in Rule of Court 7,955(b). CRC Rule 7.955(b) provides:
(b) Factors the court may
consider in determining a reasonable attorney's fee. In determining a
reasonable attorney's fee, the court may consider the following nonexclusive
factors:
(1) The fact that a minor or
person with a disability is involved and the circumstances of that minor or
person with a disability.
(2) The amount of the fee in
proportion to the value of the services performed.
(3) The novelty and difficulty of
the questions involved and the skill required to perform the legal services
properly.
(4) The amount involved and the
results obtained.
(5) The time limitations or
constraints imposed by the representative of the minor or person with a
disability or by the circumstances.
(6) The nature and length of the
professional relationship between the attorney and the representative of the
minor or person with a disability.
(7) The experience, reputation,
and ability of the attorney or attorneys performing the legal services.
(8) The time and labor required.
(9) The informed consent of the
representative of the minor or person with a disability to the fee.
(10) The relative sophistication
of the attorney and the representative of the minor or person with a
disability.
(11) The likelihood, if apparent
to the representative of the minor or person with a disability when the
representation agreement was made, that the attorney's acceptance of the
particular employment would preclude other employment.
(12) Whether the fee is fixed,
hourly, or contingent.
(13) If the fee is contingent: 
(A) The risk of loss borne by the
attorney;
(B) The amount of costs advanced
by the attorney; and
(C) The delay in payment of fees
and reimbursement of costs paid by the attorney.
(14) Statutory requirements for
representation agreements applicable to particular cases or claims. 
(Cal. Rules of Court Rule 7.955(b).) The
Court addresses these factors below. 
Amount of Fee in Proportion to
Value of Services Performed 
Plaintiff's counsel contends that
an attorney fee of 40% of the sum recovered on behalf of the disabled claimant
is a reasonable fee in proportion to the services provided for more than 3
years,  and the result obtained, and
reflects the market rate. (Declaration of Christa H. Ramey ISO Petition ¶¶ 9-15.) 
Novelty and Difficulty 
Plaintiff's counsel contends that
this area of law is both novel and difficult, and requires a different level of
skill and expertise. This case was even more complex because it deals with a
disabled and non-verbal client. Counsel states that the case required extensive
investigation, navigation of government claim filing requirements, witness
interviews, review of medical records, discovery, client meetings, and
communication, retention of three experts, in addition to court appearances and
drafting of documents. (Ramey ¶ 14.) 
Amount Involved and Results
Obtained 
Plaintiff's counsel states that
Defendant McKinley will pay a total of $800,000.00. (Ramey Decl. ¶ 13.) 
Nature and Length of Professional
Relationship 
Plaintiff’s counsel has been representing
Plaintiff in this action since November of 2020. (Ramey Decl. ¶ 14(6).) 
Experience, Reputation, and
Ability of Counsel 
Plaintiff’s counsel states that she
has been practicing since 2000, and approximately 75% of her practice involves representing
minors in school bullying and abuse cases. Counsel has extensive trial
experience and is a frequent speaker and author on topics in this area of the
law. Counsel has also received numerous awards and recognitions. (Ramey Decl. ¶
14(7).) 
Time and Labor Required 
Plaintiffs' counsel has been
working on this case for more than three years, and estimates that more than
1000 hours of work were performed on this case. (Ramey Deck. ¶ 14(8).) 
Acceptance of Case Precluding
Other Employment 
Plaintiff’s counsel does not
address whether acceptance of this case precluded other employment. 
Contingent Fee 
Plaintiff’s counsel states this
case was taken strictly on a contingency basis, and all costs and expenses, in
the total amount of $64,479.76 were borne by Plaintiff’s counsel. (Ramey Decl.
¶ 14(4), (13), (14).) 
The Court finds that Plaintiff’s
counsel has adequately demonstrated the reasonableness of the fee award in
light of the factors and circumstances in this case. 
Medical Bills: 
Claimant has incurred $85,321.32
in medical expenses, but Medi-Cal has agreed to reduce its lien to $40,000.00. (Petition
¶ 12, Attach. 12b(4)(c).) 
Costs 
Petitioner’s counsel is seeking
to recover $6,675.50 in costs advanced by Ramey Law, PC and $57,804.26 in costs
advanced by Abir Cohen Treyzon Salo, LLP, for a total of $64,479.76 in costs.
(Petition ¶13b, Attach. 13b.) 
Amount to Be Paid to Claimant: 
The net amount to be paid to claimant
D.C. is $375,520.24. (Petition ¶ 15.) 
Disposition of Balance of
Proceeds: 
Petitioner requests that the net
proceeds, $375,520.24, be invested in a single-premium deferred annuity, subject
to withdrawal only on authorization of the Court. (Petition ¶ 18.b.(3), Attach.
18b(3).) 
Court Appearance: 
California Rule of Court 7.952
requires attendance by the petitioner and claimant unless the court for good
cause dispenses with their personal appearance. The Court finds that the
appearance of the claimant is not required due to the nature of his disability. 
Prognosis: 
Claimant has not recovered
completely from the effects of his injuries but has learned coping mechanisms.
(Petition ¶ 8.) 
Proposed Order MC-351: 
Petitioner has filed a Proposed
Order Form MC-351 for the claimant. 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds the settlement to
be fair and adequate. As the petition is procedurally in order, the Petition
for Approval of Compromise of Action for Person with a Disability is GRANTED. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court
GRANTS Claimant D.C.’s petition
for approval of compromise of action for person
with a disability. The Court will sign the Order Approving Compromise of Claim
Or Action Or Disposition Of Proceeds Of Judgment For Minor Or Person With A
Disability. 
The Court will set an OSC re Proof of Funding of
Settlement and Purchase of Annuity. 
Petitioner is ordered to provide notice of the Court’s
ruling and file proof of service of same within five days of the Court’s order.
