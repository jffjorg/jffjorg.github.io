Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The petition to compel arbitration filed by Defendant American Honda Motor Co., Inc. is denied. The Court finds that the warranty obligations under the Song-Beverly Act are not inextricably intertwined with the arbitration agreement in the Motor Vehicle Lease Agreement (MVLA). The MVLA is primarily concerned with the financing of the vehicle and does not apply to the claims against American Honda Motor Co. The Court also sustains Plaintiff's objection to a paragraph in the declaration of Andres F. Michel that explains what the MVLA is. The Court denies the petition on the merits, finding that the warranty obligations under the Song-Beverly Act are not covered by the MVLA.
