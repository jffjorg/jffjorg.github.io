SUMMARY OF
ACTION
On January 15,
2024, Plaintiff Raul Gutierrez (Plaintiff) served Defendant Hector
Vidal-Ramirez (Defendant) with Requests for Admissions, Set One. Defendant’s
responses were due on February 16, 2024. On January 29, 2024, defense counsel
requested a 14-day extension to the deadline. Based on the extension, verified
responses were due on March 1, 2024. On February 16, 2024, Defendant served
unverified answers without objections to the Requests for Admission. On
February 21 and 26, Plaintiff informed Defendant that Plaintiff did not receive
Defendant’s verification. On February 26, 2024, Defendant served Amended
Responses, but these were also unverified and without objection. Plaintiff
filed this motion on March 8, 2024. Plaintiff seeks an order deeming the
Requests for Admission admitted. Defendant also seeks sanctions in the amount
of $500.00 against Defendant and/or Defendant’s counsel of record for having to
bring the motion.
 
On March 15,
2024, Defendant filed an opposition indicating that he served verified amended
responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admissions via email on March 7, 2024.
Defendant indicates that the late service was due to internal clerical issues
at his counsel’s law firm. Defendant also requests that sanctions be imposed
against his counsel’s law firm only. No reply has been filed.
 
ANALYSIS
“Any party may
obtain discovery . . . by a written request that any other party to the action
admit the genuineness of specified documents, or the truth of specified matters
of fact, opinion relating to fact, or application of law to fact. A request for
admission may relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties.”
(CCP § 2033.010.)  “Within 30 days after service of requests for
admission, the party to whom the requests are directed shall serve the original
of the response to them on the requesting party, and a copy of the response on
all other parties who have appeared…” (CCP § 2033.250(a).) 
 
If a party to
whom request for admissions are served fails to provide a timely response, the
party to whom the request was directed waives any objections, including based
on privilege or the work product doctrine. (CCP § 2033.280(a).) The requesting
party can move for an order that the genuineness of any documents and the truth
of any matters specified in the request be deemed admitted, as well as for
monetary sanctions. (CCP § 2033.280(b).) The court shall issue this order
unless the party to whom the request was made serves a response in substantial
compliance prior to the hearing on the motion. (CCP § 2033.280(c).) 
 
Though
untimely, Defendant has now served verified responses to Plaintiff’s Requests
for Admissions, Set One. Plaintiff did not file a reply, so there is no
indication that the responses were not in substantial compliance. Therefore,
the Court will not issue an order deeming the requests for admissions admitted.
However, as discussed below, sanctions will be imposed on Defendant’s counsel.
 
Sanctions
Sanctions are
mandatory against the party, the attorney, or both whose failure to serve a
timely response to the request necessitated the motion to deem request for
admissions as admitted. (CCP § 2033.280(c); see also Cal. Rules of Court R.
3.1348(a) (the court can award sanctions under the Discovery Act in favor of a
party seeking to compel discovery even though no opposition was filed, the
opposition was withdrawn, or the requested discovery was provided to the moving
party after the motion was filed).)
 
Plaintiff has
requested sanctions in the amount of $500.00 against Defendant and/or Defendant’s
counsel of record for having to bring this motion. The amount was based on Plaintiff’s
counsel spending 2 hours preparing the motion at $250 an hour. (Estrada Decl.,
¶ 12.) The amount that Plaintiff has requested appears to be reasonable for this
motion.
 
Defendant’s
counsel has requested that the sanctions be imposed against Defendant’s
counsel’s firm, Martinez, Dieterich & Zarcone Legal Group, only, and not
against Defendant. The Court will honor this request
 
Plaintiff’s
request for sanctions against Defendant’s counsel of record is granted in the
amount of $500.00 for this motion.
 
ORDER
1.      1. Plaintiff’s
motion to deem requests for admissions admitted is denied as moot.
2.      2. Defendant’s
counsel of record is ordered to pay sanctions in the total amount of $500.00. Defendant’s
counsel of record is ordered to pay these sanctions to Plaintiff’s counsel
within twenty (20) days.
