And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's motion to deem the requests for admissions admitted as moot, since the defendant has now served verified responses. The court will not issue an order deeming the requests for admissions admitted. However, the court will impose sanctions on the defendant's counsel in the amount of $500.00 for failing to serve a timely response to the requests for admissions. The sanctions will be paid by the defendant's counsel to the plaintiff's counsel within 20 days.
