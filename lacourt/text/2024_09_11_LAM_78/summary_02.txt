And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for a protective order filed by Defendant Force Protection Agency, Inc. (FPA). The motion sought to prevent depositions of FPA employees and others until FPA receives certain information, including the complete client file from former counsel and discovery responses from Plaintiff Charles Bernal. The judge found that FPA failed to show good cause for the protective order and that there was no evidence of unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden and expense. The judge noted that FPA's counsel had only recently substituted into the case and had not yet received the complete client file, but that FPA's former counsel had failed to adequately represent FPA and had not pursued meaningful discovery. The judge also found that FPA's current counsel had joined the case prior to expert discovery, which suggested that there was no additional information that FPA was unaware of. As a result, the judge denied the motion for a protective order.
