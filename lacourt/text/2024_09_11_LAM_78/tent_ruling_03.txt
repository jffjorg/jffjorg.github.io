 Case Number:  23STCV17048    Hearing Date:   September 11, 2024    Dept:  78 BACKGROUND   On June  20, 2023, Plaintiff Zaheer Goodman-Bhyat (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint  against Defendants Evolver Group, LLC (“Evolver”), Cheni Yerushalmi  (“Yerushalmi”), and Adam Gerstein (“Gerstein”) (collectively, “Defendants”).   On  September 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative First Amended Complaint  (“FAC”) against Defendants alleging causes of action for: (1) Fraud in the  Inducement; (2) Negligent Misrepresentation; (3) Breach of Implied Covenant of  Good Faith and Fair Dealing; (4) Unfair Business Practices; and (5) Conversion.     On  February 28, 2024, after hearing oral argument, the Court overruled Defendants’  demurrer to the first, second, and fifth causes of action, and sustained the  demurer of Defendants to the third and fourth causes of action without leave to  amend. (02/28/24 Minute Order.) The Court also denied Defendants’ motion to  strike. (02/28/24 Minute Order.)    On May  23, 2024, Defendants filed a joint Answer to the FAC.    On June  25, 2024, this action was reassigned from the Honorable Jill Feeney to the  Honorable Michelle C. Kim sitting in Department 78 at Stanley Mosk Courthouse  effective July 5, 2024.     On July  1, 2024, Patrick C. McGarrigle, Esq. and Michael J. Kenney, Esq. of McGarrigle,  Kenney, & Zampiello, APC filed and served the instant unopposed Motion to  be Relieved as Counsel for Defendants (“Counsel”).    ANALYSIS   I.         Relieved  as Counsel        A.               Legal Standard  The court  may order that an attorney be changed or substituted at any time before or  after judgment or final determination upon request by either client or attorney  and after notice from one to the other. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(2).) “The  determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies  within the sound discretion of the trial court.” Manfredi & Levine v.  Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.    An  application to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council Form  MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a)),  MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(c)), and MC-053  (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e)). The proposed order must  specify all hearing dates scheduled in the action or proceeding, including the  date of trial, if known.  (Cal. Rules of  Court, rule 3.1362(e).)  Further, the  requisite forms must be served on the client and all other parties who have  appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(d).) The court may  delay the effective date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service  of a copy of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court.  (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) A motion to withdraw will not be granted  where withdrawal would prejudice the client. Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21  Cal.App.4th 904, 915.   B.        Discussion  According to the declaration in  support of the  motion, “Counsel  requested that Defendants sign and return a Substitution of Attorney Form to  effectuate the change by consent pursuant to CCP 284(a), but same was not completed  and returned, nor have the circumstances necessitating the substitution and  relief/withdrawal been rectified by the clients.” (See Form MC-052.) According  to Attachment 2 of the Form MC-052, Defendants have not made a payment pursuant  to the terms of the written retainer agreement since approximately January  2024. (See Form MC-052 at Attachment 2.) Counsel also indicates that further  representation of Defendants has been made impossible due to Defendants’  unwillingness to communicate consistently regarding the subject matter of the  instant action. (See Form MC-052 at Attachment 2.)  The Court finds that Counsel has set  forth a valid reason to warrant withdrawal from representing Defendants. Further,  the forms have been served on all clients. II.        Conclusion                       Based on the foregoing, the Motion to be Relieved as  Counsel filed by Patrick C. McGarrigle, Esq. and Michael J. Kenney, Esq. of  McGarrigle, Kenney, & Zampiello, APC is GRANTED. The order will be final  upon proof of service of the Final Order. The Court sets a Status Conference re: Proof of Service of the Final Order on September __, 2024, 8:30AM.               Moving Party is ordered to give  notice.
