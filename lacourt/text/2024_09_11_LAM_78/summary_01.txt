And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying GRCA2 Development, LLC and Gerry Wiener's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication on the second, third, and fifth causes of action. The plaintiff, Daniel Chu, alleges that GRCA2 breached the 2016 Settlement Agreement and that the agreement was obtained through fraud and deceit. The judge finds that there are triable issues of fact as to whether the 2016 Settlement Agreement was breached and whether there was fraud. The judge also finds that there is a triable issue of fact as to when the causes of action accrued due to delayed discovery. As a result, the motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication is denied in its entirety.
