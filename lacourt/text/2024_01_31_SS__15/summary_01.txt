And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to a motion to compel testing of a tissue sample. The motion was filed by the defendant on January 25, 2024, and the plaintiffs were supposed to file an opposition by January 29, 2024. However, the defendant served the motion at 8:17 pm instead of 5:00 pm, giving the plaintiffs insufficient time to respond. As a result, the judge has continued the hearing to February 7, 2024, and ordered the plaintiffs to file their opposition by February 5, 2024. The moving party is required to give notice of the new hearing date.
