  Case Number:  22STCV10623    Hearing Date:   January 31, 2024    Dept:  15 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE MOTION TO COMPEL
            On January
23, 2024, the court set an expedited briefing schedule for Defendant to file a
motion to compel testing of tissue sample by January 25, 2024, and Plaintiffs
to file an opposition by January 29, 2024, with a hearing on January 31,
2024.  Plaintiffs complain that Defendant
served the motion at 8:17 pm instead of by 5:00 pm, and thereby did not give
Plaintiffs enough time to file an opposition. 
Therefore, the court CONTINUES the hearing to February 7, 2024 at 9
a.m.  Plaintiffs are to file any
opposition by February 5, 2024.
            The
moving party is to give notice.
