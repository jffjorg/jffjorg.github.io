And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling grants a default judgment of $29,51.22 to L.A. Commercial Group, Inc. against Eatnaked.LA dba The Fernando Restrepo Store. The plaintiff requested a default judgment of $38,439.89, consisting of the original amount owed, collection costs, interest, and attorney's fees. However, the court cannot grant a judgment for the requested amount because the complaint does not specify the amount of collection costs. The court notes that the defendant's contract with Shamrock Foods promises to pay "cost of collection," but the amount is not specified. The court suggests that the plaintiff may amend the complaint and serve it on the defendant if it wishes to pursue a greater amount in damages. The hearing is continued to a later date for further discussion.
