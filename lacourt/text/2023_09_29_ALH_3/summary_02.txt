**Summary:**

The Judge, William A. Crowfoot, states that Plaintiff L.A. Commercial Group, Inc. filed an action against Defendant Eatnaked.LA (dba The Fernando Restrepo Store) on December 23, 2022. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant owed Plaintiff's assignor, Shamrock Foods, $25,513.35 on an open book account, and Shamrock Foods assigned the claim to Plaintiff. Plaintiff requests a default judgment of $38,439.89, consisting of the demanded amount, collection costs, interest, costs, and attorney's fees. However, the Judge cannot grant the full amount because the complaint does not specify a particular amount for the requested "collection costs."

The Judge can only grant a total judgment of $29,51.22. Plaintiff may submit a revised proposed judgment reflecting the lesser amount or amend the complaint and serve it on Defendant if they wish to pursue a greater amount in damages. The Judge may vacate the default if Plaintiff chooses to submit a revised proposed judgment, which must be done at least 10 days before the hearing. If not, the Plaintiff must appear at the hearing. If no one appears at the hearing, the Court may adopt the tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar.
