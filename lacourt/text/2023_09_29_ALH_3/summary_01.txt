And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, William A. Crowfoot, has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion to be relieved filed by Ray Hsu, counsel for the plaintiffs Jin Zhou and Qi He. The motion is unopposed and is based on a breakdown in communication between Hsu and his clients, which has caused extreme difficulty in maintaining representation. The Judge has determined that absent any showing of prejudice, a motion to be relieved should be granted. Since there is no prejudice to the parties and trial in the matter is not yet set, the Judge has granted the motion and ordered Hsu to serve a copy of the signed order on the plaintiffs and all parties who have appeared in the action. The Judge notes that if any party intends to submit on the tentative, they must send an email to the Court indicating their intention to do so, and that the Court may adopt the tentative as the final order or place the motion off calendar if no submissions are received.
