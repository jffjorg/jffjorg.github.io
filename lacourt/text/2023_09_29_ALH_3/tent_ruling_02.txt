          Plaintiff
L.A. Commercial Group, Inc. filed this action against defendant Eatnaked.LA dba
The Fernando Restrepo Store on December 23, 2022.  Plaintiff alleges Defendant owed Plaintiff’s
assignor, Shamrock Foods, $25,513.35 on an open book account; Shamrock Foods
then assigned the claim to Plaintiff.  
Plaintiff requests a default judgment
of $38,439.89 consisting of $25,513.35 as demanded in the complaint, $8,29.67 for
collection costs/general damages, $2,289.92 in interest at a rate of 18%,
$551.55 in costs, and $1,155.40 in attorney’s fees.  
In Defendant’s contract with Shamrock
Foods, Defendant promised to pay “cost of collection equal to a minimum amount
of thirty-five percent, or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is
lower, of the principal amount.” 
However, Plaintiff’s complaint does not identify a specific amount for the
requested “collection costs.”  Therefore,
the Court can only grant a total judgment of $29,51.22.  (Airs Aromatics, LLC v. CBL Data Recovery
Technologies, Inc. (2018) 23 Cal.App.5th 1013, 1024.)  If Plaintiff wishes to pursue a greater
amount in damages, the Court can vacate the default and Plaintiff may amend the
complaint and serve it on Defendant. Otherwise, Plaintiff may submit a revised proposed
judgment which reflects the lesser amount. 
The hearing is continued to ________ at
8:30 a.m. in Department 3 of the Alhambra Courthouse.  If Plaintiff elects to submit a revised
proposed judgment, it must do so at least 10 days before the hearing.   
 
Dated
this 29th
day of September, 2023
