And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding a motion brought by Anastasiia Arseneva, cross-complainant, to compel further responses to her form interrogatories/RFAs directed at Zambrano and Ashley Cubas. The judge denied the motion as to Zambrano, finding that the separate statement was deficient and the responses were sufficient. However, the judge granted the motion in part as to Ashley Cubas, finding that the responses were insufficient with respect to discovery relating to Ashley's emails and real property. The judge ordered further responses to be provided by Ashley Cubas within 30 days. The judge also noted that no responses were necessary for Ashley's whereabouts, as the relevance of that information had not been sufficiently explained.
