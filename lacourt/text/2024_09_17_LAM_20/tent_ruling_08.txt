 This is a PAGA action.  Defendants JSI Acquisition, Inc. and Jonathan Istrin now seek to compel arbitration. Plaintiff Tykiah Torres argues that arbitration should be denied because the FAA does not apply.  Torres also argues that if arbitration is compelled, the Court should not stay the representative PAGA claim.  “[I]f parties agree to apply the FAA's procedural provisions, rather than the procedures of the CAA, then the state arbitration procedures do not apply . . . .”  (Hernandez v. Sohnen Enterprises, Inc. (2024) 102 Cal.App.5th 222, 240.)The Court concludes that the FAA applies because the subject agreement states, “The Parties agree that this Agreement shall be enforceable under and subject to the substantive and procedural provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1, et seq. The Parties also understand and agree that the Company is engaged in transactions involving interstate commerce. ”  There are no references to California procedural law.  The only reference to California law is the types of claims encompassed by the agreement, which is irrelevant.  This situation is similar to the one in Hernandez.  “The parties selected the procedural provisions of the FAA and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and therefore, the procedures of the CAA . . . do not apply.”  (Hernandez v. Sohnen Enterprises, Inc. (2024) 102 Cal.App.5th 222, 241-42.)Because the FAA applies, there is no question that Plaintiff’s individual PAGA claim should be compelled to arbitration.  The Motion is granted.  Further, the representative claim shall be stayed pending the resolution of arbitration.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.4; see also Adolph v. Uber Techs., Inc. (2023) 14 Cal.5th 1104, 1125.) Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
