 On March 6, 2023, Plaintiff AMAG, Inc. filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) for (1) fraudulent conversion, (2) misrepresentation, (3) constructive fraud, (4) breach of fiduciary duty, and (5) declaratory relief.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Vlaze Media Networks, Inc. sought to avoid the judgment against it in case no. BC587406 by fraudulently transferring certain assets to the other Defendants or with the help of the other Defendants.   On May 1, 2023, Anastasiia Arseneva filed the operative Second Amended Cross-Complaint (“SACC”) for (1) breach of written contract, (2) quantum meruit, (3) violation of Pen. Code §§ 528.5, 529, and (4) declaratory relief. Arseneva now seeks to compel further responses to her form interrogatories/RFAs directed at Zambrano.  The Motion is denied.  The separate statement is deficient, failing to indicate all complete responses by Zambrano and failing to sufficiently explain the basis for further responses; the discovery is duplicative and cumulative; and the responses are sufficient. Arseneva also seeks to compel further responses to her RFAs/form interrogatories from Ashley Cubas.  The discovery relates to Ashley’s ownership and possession of certain property alleged to be fraudulently transferred; Ashley’s whereabouts on particular dates; and Ashley’s possible emails.  The objections mostly lack merit, and the responses are insufficient with respect to the discovery relating to Ashley’s emails and her real property.  Further responses are to be provided within 30 days.  No responses are necessary for Ashely’s whereabouts, the relevance of which has not been sufficiently explained.  The Motion is granted in part.   Moving party to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
