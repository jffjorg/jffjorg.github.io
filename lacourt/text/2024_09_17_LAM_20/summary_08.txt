And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a PAGA action, where the defendants, JSI Acquisition, Inc. and Jonathan Istrin, have moved to compel arbitration. The plaintiff, Tykiah Torres, argues that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) does not apply and that the representative PAGA claim should not be stayed pending arbitration. The judge concludes that the FAA applies because the agreement states that it will be enforced under the FAA's procedural provisions. The judge cites Hernandez v. Sohnen Enterprises, Inc. (2024) 102 Cal.App.5th 222, which holds that if parties agree to apply the FAA's procedural provisions, then the state arbitration procedures do not apply. The judge grants the motion to compel arbitration and stays the representative claim pending the resolution of arbitration.
