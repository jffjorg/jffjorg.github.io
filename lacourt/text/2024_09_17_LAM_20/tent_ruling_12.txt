 This is a medical malpractice suit. Defendants Wael Noor El-Nachef, Tanya Anderson, and Mari Hurtado assert a Demurrer and Motion to Strike. Defendant County of LA asserts a separate Demurrer and Motion to Strike. On May 28, 2024, the Court continued the Demurrers and Motions to Strike pending the outcome of 23STCP04028.  This is because the Demurrers argue that Plaintiff did not file a timely government claim and Plaintiff filed a petition in 23STCP04028 to be able to file a late government claim.  On July 8, 2024, that petition was denied.  Therefore, the Demurrers are sustained, without leave to amend. The Motions to Strike are denied as moot.Moving parties to give notice.
