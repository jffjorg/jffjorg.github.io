BACKGROUND
            On December 22, 2022, Strategic
Funding Source, Inc. d/b/a Kapitus filed a complaint against Ocean View
Academy, LLC d/b/a Ocean View Academy and Liliana Lujan for breach of contract.
            On May 8, 2023, the parties
stipulated and the Court ordered that the case be dismissed without prejudice and
that the Court retain jurisdiction pursuant to CCP §664.6.
LEGAL AUTHORITY
Pursuant to CCP §664.6:  “If parties to pending litigation stipulate,
in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally
before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon
motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  If
requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to
enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.” 
“Section 664.6 was enacted to
provide a summary procedure for specifically enforcing a settlement contract
without the need for a new lawsuit.”  Chan v. Lund (2010)
188 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1165-66 (quoting Weddington Productions,
Inc. v. Flick (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 809-10).  Under CCP
§664.6, a court may determine disputed factual issues regarding the settlement
agreement and even permits the court “to entertain challenges to the actual
terms of the stipulation, that is, whether there actually was a settlement . .
. and to interpret the terms of the settlement agreement.”  Fiore
v. Alvord (1985) 182 Cal. App. 3d 561, 566. 
DISCUSSION
            Under CCP §664.6, plaintiff Strategic
Funding Source, Inc. dba Kapitus requests an order to set aside and vacate the
dismissal and enter judgment against defendants.
            On May 8, 2023, the case was
dismissed, and the Court retained jurisdiction under CCP §664.6 to enforce the
settlement agreement.
            Plaintiff explains that the parties
entered into a settlement agreement on January 11, 2023. As set forth in the
agreement, defendants were required to pay the total sum of $126,256 in
accordance with a specified payment schedule. 
The parties also executed a Stipulation for Entry of Judgment, whereby
the parties agreed that judgment in the amount of $126,311, minus any payments
made by defendants, plus prejudgment interest, would be entered in favor of
plaintiff and against defendants, should defendants breach the settlement
agreement.  Plaintiff asserts that on
November 14, 2023, defendants defaulted leaving an outstanding balance of $93,951.  By letter dated February 28, 2024,
plaintiff’s counsel provided defendants with a written notice of breach.  Defendants failed to respond or make any
further settlement payments.  See David
Zullo decl., Jennifer Goosenberg decl.
            Accordingly, the motion is GRANTED.

The dismissal entered on May 8,
