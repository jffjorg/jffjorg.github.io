```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendants' motions to compel responses to their form interrogatories and demand for identification and production of records, documents, and other tangible items. The defendants had served their discovery requests on the plaintiffs, but the plaintiffs failed to respond. The court finds that the defendants properly served their discovery requests and the plaintiffs failed to respond. As a result, the court is ordering the plaintiffs to respond without objections to the defendants' form interrogatories and to produce all responsive documents within 20 days.
