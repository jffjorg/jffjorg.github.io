And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants plaintiff Tanya Mansourian's motion for leave to file a first amended complaint, which will add Farmers Insurance as the HOA insurer. The proposed additions to the complaint are set forth in the Notice of Motion, and the Declaration of Valentina Ambarchyan explains why the amendment is necessary and proper. The judge notes that Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1324(b) requires a separate declaration that specifies the effect of the amendment, why it is necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered, and why the request for amendment was not made earlier. Although the declaration does not strictly comply with this rule, the judge finds that the amendment is generally required to be liberally granted, and that there is no prejudice to the opposing party. Therefore, the motion is granted, and plaintiff is to file a stand-alone copy of the First Amended Complaint today, which will be deemed served as of the date of this order.
