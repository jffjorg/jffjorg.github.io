ANALYSIS
Motion For Leave To File Amended Complaint
Discussion
            Plaintiffs
move for leave to file a First Amended Complaint to add Farmers Insurance as
the HOA insurer.
Here, the Notice of Motion sets for the proposed
additions at Page 1:28 – 3:13.
Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1324(b)
states:
A separate declaration must accompany
the motion and must specify:
 
(1)  The effect of the
amendment;
 
(2)  Why the amendment is
necessary and proper;
 
(3)  When the facts giving
rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and
 
(4)  The reasons why the
request for amendment was not made earlier. 

   (Cal. Rules of Court, 3.1324(b).)
            The
Declaration of Valentina Ambarchyan does not strictly comply with Rule
3.1324(b), but it is apparent that Farmers Insurance finally admitted coverage
on August 26, 204, after taking the position that the loss was not covered by
the HOA’s insurance policy. (Ambarchyan Decl., ¶¶ 5 – 8.)
“Leave to amend is in general required to be
liberally granted (citation omitted), provided there is no statute of
limitations concern. Leave to amend may be denied if there is prejudice to the
opposing party, such as delay in trial, loss of critical evidence, or added
costs of preparation. (Citation omitted.)” 
(Kolani v. Gluska (1998) 64
Cal.App.4th 402.)  Where an additional theory of liability is proposed against an existing
defendant, this is not prejudice which would justify the denial of leave to amend. (See
Hirsa v. Superior Court
(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 486, 490. See also Atkinson
v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109
Cal.App.4th 739, 761: “[I]t is irrelevant that new
legal theories are introduced as long as the proposed amendments 'relate to the
same general set of facts.' [Citation.]" (Citation omitted.)) 
The motion for leave to file a
first amended complaint is GRANTED. Plaintiff is to file a stand-alone copy of
the First Amended Complaint today, which is deemed served as of the date of
this order.
