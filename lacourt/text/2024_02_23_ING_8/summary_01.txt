Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Deposition of Defendant Dominique Nikko Westmoreland and Request for Sanctions. The Court grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel deposition, ordering the Defendant to attend a deposition on March 5, 2024. The Court also denies the Plaintiff's request for sanctions, finding that the Defendant had a good faith, even though mistaken, belief that the Court's prior ruling was appealable. The Court notes that the November 13, 2023 order denying the Defendant's Motion to Enforce Settlement was not appealable, as it did not dispose of any of the parties' rights in the action. The Court further notes that the Plaintiff's motion to compel deposition is not affected by the lack of appellate jurisdiction, as the action has not been stayed.
