And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

This tentative ruling grants the petition to enforce the subpoena to produce documents. The court finds that Respondent failed to respond to the subpoena and that his claims of untimeliness and mootness are without merit. The court also finds that Respondent's objections to the subpoena are waived because they were not served in a timely manner. The court orders Respondent to provide responses without objections within 20 days of this order.
