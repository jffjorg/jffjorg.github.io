 
BACKGROUND
 
On April
27, 2023, Plaintiffs Moises Cruz and Sandy Toribio (“Plaintiffs”) filed a Complaint
against Defendants Samo Enterprises, Inc. dba Western Motor Sport (“Samo
Enterprises”), JB Financial, a partnership consisting of Susan Demirci and Igya
Demirci (“JB”), and Hudson Insurance Company (“Hudson”) (collectively,
“Defendants”), alleging causes of action for: (1) violation of the Consumer
Legal Remedies Act (“CLRA”) pursuant to California Civil Code section 1750 et
seq.; (2) violation of California Business and Professions Code section
17200 et seq.; (3) claim against dealer bond; and (4) violation of Code
of Civil Procedure sections 1281.97 and 1281.99. The complaint arises from the
sale of an allegedly defective used 2010 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 (the “Subject
Vehicle”). 
 
On May 11,
2023, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Compel Arbitration and for the Court to Pick
Arbitration Forum and Request for Stay (the “Motion”), seeking an order compelling
Defendants Samo Enterprises and JB to arbitrate the controversy pursuant to the
Retail Installment Sale Contract (“RISC”). 
 
On June
23, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Proof of Service indicating that Defendant JB had
been served with the summons, complaint, and Motion by substituted service. 
 
On June
23, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Non-Service Report as to Defendant Samo
Enterprises which sets forth attempts to serve Defendant Samo Enterprises at
17477 Doric St., Los Angeles, CA 91344. 
 
On July
10, 2023, the Court issued a minute order noting that Plaintiffs had filed a
defective Notice of Motion, which did not list the address of the Spring Street
Courthouse, where the hearing on the Motion would take place. (See July
10, 2023 Minute Order.) Plaintiffs also failed to file proof that the moving
papers were served on Samo Enterprises or Hudson. (Id.) The Court
continued the hearing on the Motion to August 10, 2023 and ordered “Plaintiffs
to file and serve a corrected Notice of Motion and to serve all parties in the
case.” (Id.) 
 
On July
7, 2023, Plaintiffs filed and served a Notice of Continued Motion, listing the
Spring Street Courthouse Address. On July 7, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Proof of
Service indicating that Defendant Hudson had been served with the summons,
complaint, and Motion. 
 
On July 19,
2023, Plaintiffs filed the Declaration of Nima Heydari in response to the
Court’s July 10, 2023, Order. 
 
On July
25, 2023, Defendant Hudson filed an Answer to the Complaint. 
 
On August
1, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Non-Service Report as to Defendant Samo
Enterprises. 
 
On August
10, 2023, the Court continued the hearing on the Motion to allow Plaintiffs
additional time to serve Defendant Samo Enterprises with the Complaint and
moving papers. (See August 10, 2023 Minute Order.) The Court continued
the hearing on the Motion to November 8, 2023 and ordered Plaintiffs “to file
supplemental papers addressing the issues discussed [in the Court’s order] at
least 16 court days before the next scheduled hearing. Failure to do so may
result in the Motion being placed off calendar or denied.” (Id.) 
 
On
September 27, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a Non-Service Report as to Defendant Samo
Enterprises. 
 
On
September 28, 2023, Plaintiffs filed an Application to Serve Defendant Samo
Enterprises through the California Secretary of State (the “Application”). 
 
On
October 24, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a declaration from Nima Heydari re: an Order
to Show Cause as to Service of Defendant Samo Enterprises.  This declaration appears to be in response to
the Court’s August 10, 2023 Order. 
 
On
November 8, 2023, the Court continued the hearing on the Motion to allow
Plaintiffs additional time to serve Defendant Samo Enterprises with the
summons, complaint, and Motion. (11/08/23 Minute Order at p. 5.) The Court also
ordered Plaintiffs to file supplemental papers addressing any additional
service efforts on Defendant Samo Enterprises. (Id.) Additionally, the
Court ordered Plaintiffs to reserve a hearing date for their application for
service. (Id.) 
 
On
February 5, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a supplemental declaration
regarding the issue of service on Defendant Samo Enterprises. On February 8,
2024, the Court, on its own motion, continued the hearing on the Motion to
April 4, 2024, and ordered Plaintiffs to serve and electronically file
supplemental papers addressing the issue of service of the Motion on Defendant
Samo Enterprises. (02/08/24 Minute order at pp. 5-6.) 
 
On March
8, 2024, the Court rejected Plaintiffs’ Application due to a defect in the
proposed order. 
 
On March
11, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel filed a supplemental declaration regarding the
issue of service on Defendant Samo Enterprises. 
 
On March
25, 2024, the Court, on its own motion, continued the hearing on the Motion to
June 6, 2024 so that Plaintiff could cure the defects in the Application.
(03/25/24 Minute Order at pp. 1-2.)  
 
On April
12, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an Application to Serve Defendant Samo
Enterprises through the California Secretary of State (the “2d Application”). 
 
On April 29, 2024, the 2d
Application was granted. 
 
On May 24, 2024, Plaintiffs filed proof
of service showing that the summons, complaint, and the instant motion were
served on Defendant Samo Enterprises on May 21, 2024 via the California Secretary
of State. 
 
On May 28, 2024, Plaintiffs’
counsel filed a declaration in support of the Motion. In such declaration,
counsel requests a 30-day continuance on the motion given that Defendant Samo
was served by way of the California Secretary of State on May 21, 2024. 
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Plaintiffs
contend that the controversy is covered by the arbitration provision in the
RISC. Plaintiffs assert that the parties do not agree on the forum of
arbitration. Plaintiffs indicate that they elect the American Arbitration
Association (“AAA”) or, in the alternative, JAMS as the arbitration forum. 
 
OPPOSITION
 
            No
opposition brief was filed. 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Compelling
Arbitration   
A.               
Legal Standard 
“A party who claims that there is a
written agreement to arbitrate may petition the superior court for an order to
compel arbitration” pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section
1281.2. Banner Entertainment, Inc. v. Superior Court (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th
348, 356. “California law, like federal law, favors enforcement of valid
arbitration agreements.” Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services,
Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 97. “On petition of a party to an arbitration
agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a
controversy and that a party to the agreement refuses to arbitrate that
controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to
arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the
controversy exists, unless it determines that: (a) The right to compel
arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or (b) Grounds exist for
rescission of the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.2.) A party opposing a
petition to compel arbitration “bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence any fact necessary to its defense.” Banner Entertainment,
Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 62 Cal.App.4th 348, 356. 
Where a petition to compel arbitration
is granted, a court “shall, upon motion of a party to such action or
proceeding, stay the action or proceeding until an arbitration is had in
accordance with the order to arbitrate or until such earlier time as the court
specifies.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.4.)
B.        Discussion  
In support of the Motion, in a
declaration filed on May 28, 2024, Plaintiffs’ counsel Kasra Sadr (“Sadr”)
declares that Defendant Samo Enterprises was served by way of the California
Secretary of State on May 21, 2024. (Sadr Decl., ¶ 3.) Ms. Sadr declares that
unfortunately the service date “does not leave enough time before the hearing
currently scheduled for June 6, 2024. As such, Plaintiff requests a short, 30-day
continuance of the hearing.” (Sadr Decl., ¶ 3.) 
All moving and supporting papers must
be served and filed at least 16 court days before the hearing. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) Due process requires that an opposing party be given
adequate notice. Fenn v. Sherriff (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1466, 1481. 
Here, Defendant Samo Enterprises was
served with the summons, complaint, and Motion on May 21, 2024. The Motion was
therefore served on Defendant Samo Enterprises less than 16 court days prior to
the hearing.  
The Court CONTINUES the hearing on the
Motion to comply with CCP § 1005(b) and to afford Defendant Samo Enterprises the
opportunity to file an opposition brief if Defendant Samo Enterprises wishes to
oppose the Motion. Defendant Samo Enterprises is entitled to notice of this
action, as well as the instant Motion, to comport with due process. 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Based on the foregoing, the hearing on the Motion
scheduled for June 6, 2024 is CONTINUED to Thursday, July
11, 2024 at 10:00 A.M. in this department. Any opposition and reply briefs
concerning the Motion must be filed and served pursuant to CCP § 1005(b).  
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of the ruling and attach the
Tentative Ruling as Exhibit “A” to the ruling.
