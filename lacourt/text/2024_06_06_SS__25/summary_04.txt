Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The case is a motion to compel arbitration and for the court to pick an arbitration forum, as well as a request for a stay of proceedings. The Plaintiffs, Moises Cruz and Sandy Toribio, have moved for arbitration, and the Responding Party has not opposed the motion. However, the Notice of Motion did not comply with CCP ยง 1005(b). The Judge notes that the motion is unopposed, and the court will likely grant the motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings.
