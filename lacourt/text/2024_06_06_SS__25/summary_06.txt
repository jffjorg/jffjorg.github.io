**Tentative Ruling**

The Court's tentative ruling is to continue the hearing on the motion to compel arbitration to Thursday, July 11, 2024 at 10:00 A.M. The motion to compel arbitration was filed by Plaintiffs Moises Cruz and Sandy Toribio against Defendants Samo Enterprises, Inc. dba Western Motor Sport, JB Financial, and Hudson Insurance Company. The controversy arises from the sale of a defective used 2010 Chevrolet Silverado 1500.

The Court ordered the continuation of the hearing to comply with California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005(b) and to afford Defendant Samo Enterprises the opportunity to file an opposition brief if it wishes to oppose the motion. The Court also ordered the moving party to give notice of the ruling and attach the tentative ruling as Exhibit "A" to the ruling.

**Background**

The Plaintiffs filed a complaint against the Defendants alleging causes of action for violation of the Consumer Legal Remedies Act, violation of California Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq., claim against dealer bond, and violation of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1281.97 and 1281.99.

**Analysis**

The Court analyzed the motion to compel arbitration and determined that the controversy is covered by the arbitration provision in the Retail Installment Sale Contract (RISC). The Court also noted that the parties do not agree on the forum of arbitration and that Plaintiffs elect the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or, in the alternative, JAMS as the arbitration forum.

**Conclusion**

Based on the foregoing, the Court continued the hearing on the motion to compel arbitration to Thursday, July 11, 2024 at 10:00 A.M. The Court also ordered the moving party to give notice of the ruling and attach the tentative ruling as Exhibit "A" to the ruling.
