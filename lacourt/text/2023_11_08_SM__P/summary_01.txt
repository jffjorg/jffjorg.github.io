And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Bergen, et al. v. Richman, Case No. 20SMCV00242. The case concerns a partition action regarding a condominium co-owned by defendant Richman, which was sold on July 30, 2021, for $829,814.39. The court entered an interlocutory judgment of partition, granting referee Howard Grobstein authority to sell the property and authorizing the deduction of fees and costs from defendant Richman's share of the sale proceeds. However, defendant Richman has refused to accept or cash the check representing his 50% share of the sale proceeds, which is currently held by the referee for $196,096.83.

The referee is seeking instructions from the court on how to proceed with the remaining amount and has requested the deduction of additional fees and costs, including $2,206.70 in outstanding professional referee fees and expenses, $24,759 in attorney's fees, and $280.92 in expenses incurred by counsel. The court has granted the referee's motion and will schedule a status conference to confirm that the funds have been deposited with the clerk of the court and to discharge the referee from further duties.
