Bergen, et al. v.
Richman, Case No. 20SMCV00242
Hearing Date
November 8, 2023 
Motion for
Instructions and Request for Attorney’s Fees and Partition Attorney’s Fees
(UNOPPOSED)
 
Bergen plaintiffs
filed a partition action regarding a condominium co-owned by defendant Richman.
The court entered an interlocutory judgment of partition, granting referee Howard
Grobstein authority to sell the property, which was completed July 30, 2021,
with buyers transferring $829,814.39 to the referee. On March 8, 2022 the court
granted plaintiffs’ motions to deduct fees (including referee fees and
attorney’s fees), costs of sale and lost rental income from defendant Richman’s
share of the sale proceeds because Richman’s failure to vacate caused the fees
and costs to be incurred. 
 
Referee Grobstein
is holding $196,096.83 in funds for Richman, representing 50% of the sale
price, minus costs and fees as provided in in the 3/8/2022 order. Grobstein and
plaintiffs attempted to deliver the check to Richman, both by mail and in
person, but he has neither cashed the check nor accepted it.
 
The referee asks
to deduct $2,206.70 in outstanding professional referee fees and expenses,
$24,759 in attorney’s fees and $280.92 in expenses incurred by counsel from the
funds currently held for Richman. He also requests instructions from the court
as to how to proceed with the remaining amount, given Richman’s apparent refusal
to accept his share. Plaintiffs filed a notice of non-opposition, and Richman
has not responded to the motion. 
 
The court’s March
8, 2022 order allows deduction of reasonable referee fees and costs as well as
attorney’s fees from Richman’s share of the sale proceeds. The claimed fees and
costs were incurred and are reasonable. See Thagard declaration ¶¶6-8, exhibits
1-3. The amounts identified in the declaration may be deducted. The referee
made good-faith efforts to give defendant his share of the sale proceeds, but Richman
has not accepted the funds nor cashed a sales check. Thagard declaration ¶¶9-13,
exhibit A.
 
Under Cal. Code of
Civ. Proc. §873.810, after a partition sale of property “the court shall order
the proceeds of sale and any security therefor to be paid, transferred
deposited in court . . . to or for the benefit of the persons in interest
entitled thereto, as may be appropriate or as specifically provided in this
article.” Given Richman’s apparent refusal to accept payment, a court deposit
of his share is appropriate under §873.810. The referee will deposit the funds
with the clerk of the court and provide notice to Richman of the fact of
deposit, and that he may claim his funds from the court.  
 
GRANTED as set forth above. A status conference will
be scheduled for the referee to confirm that the funds have been deposited, and
then be discharged from further duties.
