And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by the judge grants defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the medical battery claim. The plaintiff, Alvarez, sued for injuries resulting from surgeries in August 2018 and November 2020. The court previously granted summary judgment as to claims arising out of the 2018 surgery, but denied summary judgment as to the medical battery claim arising out of the 2020 surgery. The defendants argued that the remaining allegations did not support a cause of action for medical battery, and the judge agreed. The judge found that the allegations regarding the size and type of breast implants used during the surgery were subject to summary judgment, and that Alvarez's remaining battery allegations related to the outcome of the surgery, not the nature of the procedure performed. Therefore, the judge ruled that Alvarez's claims were better suited to a medical negligence claim rather than a battery claim.
