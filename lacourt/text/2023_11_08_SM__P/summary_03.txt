Here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge in the case of Yazdi v. Robles, et al. The case involves a dispute between dentist Yazdi and dentist Baum over a dental malpractice arbitration action. Baum is moving to strike Yazdi's claims for equitable indemnity and contribution, arguing that his testimony in the arbitration was protected by the anti-SLAPP statute. The judge has denied Baum's anti-SLAPP motion because his testimony was not made in a "judicial proceeding" or an "official proceeding authorized by law" and is therefore not protected.

In addition, the judge has sustained Baum's demurrer to the complaint, arguing that the claims for contribution and equitable indemnity are time-barred. The judge has taken judicial notice of the May 17, 2018 order confirming the arbitration award and the May 16, 2019 Court of Appeal order affirming the award.

The judge has also sustained Baum's demurrer to the complaint's cause of action seeking "equitable relief from the judgment in its entirety," because the court does not have the authority to provide relief from a judgment entered by a separate court and affirmed by the court of appeal.

In summary, the judge has denied Baum's anti-SLAPP motion, sustained his demurrer to the complaint, and sustained his demurrer to the cause of action seeking equitable relief from the judgment.
