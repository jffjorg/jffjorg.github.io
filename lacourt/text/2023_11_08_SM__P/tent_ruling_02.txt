Alvarez v. Kohan, et
al., Case No. 22SMCV01009
Hearing Date
November 8, 2023 
Defendants Kohan’s
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings
 
Plaintiff Alvarez
sues for injuries as a result of surgeries in August 2018 and November 2020. On
September 13, 2023 the court granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment as
to Alvarez’s claims arising out of the 2018 surgery, but denied summary
judgment as to the 2020 surgery. The court denied summary judgment as to the
medical battery claim arising out of the 2020 surgery, concluding “[t]his
argument should be made via motion for judgment on the pleadings[.]” 9/13/2023 minute
order pg. 3. Defendants Dr. Kohan and his corporation seek judgment on the
pleadings as to the medical battery claim.
 
A cause of action
for medical battery lies when the defendant performs a medical procedure
without plaintiff’s consent, or if the plaintiff consented to one procedure and
the defendant performed a substantially different procedure. CACI 530A. 
 
Defendants argue the
remaining allegations do not support a cause of action for medical battery. 
The FAC alleges defendant
Kohan used a size and type of breast implant Alvarez did not consent to. FAC
¶26. Per the FAC, the surgery was in August 2018. FAC ¶9. To the extent the
medical battery claim was based on the first surgery, it is subject to summary
judgment pursuant to the court’s 9/13/23 ruling. Therefore, the allegations
regarding the size and type of the breast implants cannot support Alvarez’s
medical battery claim.
 
Alvarez’s
remaining battery allegations relate to the outcome of the surgery, not the
nature of the procedure performed. FAC ¶¶26-29. Alvarez alleges the surgeries produced
asymmetric breasts and buttocks. She does not allege these asymmetries were
caused by a nonconsensual surgery, but that defendant performed a consensual
surgery that resulted in physical harm. Such a claim lies in medical
negligence, not battery. GRANTED.
