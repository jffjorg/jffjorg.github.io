Significant Statements:
  - "The Court should enter terminating sanctions against Defendant Nunn by striking his Answer and entering default against the defendant."
  - "The Court should also enter an order imposing sanctions of $1,573.75 against the defendant."
  - "The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse 'after considering [1] the totality of the circumstances: [2] [the] conduct of the party to determine if the actions were willful; [3] the detriment to the propounding party; and [4] the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the discovery.'"
  - "Generally, '[a] decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.'"
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion for terminating sanctions against Defendant James Nunn (aka James Nunn Jr, James J Nunn, James J Nunn Jr, James Joseph Nunn, Joseph James Nunn, and Joseph Nunn) for his failure to comply with a court order to produce discovery responses and pay sanctions. The court finds that Nunn's failure to comply with the order constitutes misuse of the discovery process and that terminating sanctions are proper under the circumstances. The judge grants the motion for terminating sanctions against Nunn, striking his Answer and entering default against him.
