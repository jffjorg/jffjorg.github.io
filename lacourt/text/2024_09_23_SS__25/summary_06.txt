And here is the English text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Motion to Dismiss filed by Defendant PACMAD, LLC. The Motion was filed on August 27, 2024, and the trial date was set for August 28, 2024. The Plaintiff, Michael Long, had filed a complaint against PACMAD, LLC, AAN ENTERPRISES, INC, and Amy Tsao for lack of access to public accommodations.

The Judge has denied the Motion to Dismiss, finding that the Plaintiff's failure to meet and confer before the trial date is not a sufficient reason to dismiss the complaint. The Judge has also denied the Defendant's request for sanctions, finding that the Plaintiff's counsel did not have a bad faith motive for not filing for a continuance.

The Judge has ordered that the trial date be continued to October 14, 2024, and that the Plaintiff's counsel notify the Defendant's counsel of the new trial date.
