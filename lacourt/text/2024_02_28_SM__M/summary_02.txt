Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the plaintiff's request for attorney fees and costs and has made a tentative ruling. The plaintiff is seeking $22,717.50 in attorney fees, plus an additional $4,000.00 in costs. The judge has reviewed the invoices and descriptions provided by the plaintiff's counsel and has found certain entries to be ambiguous or vague, and has reduced the claimed hours worked accordingly.

The judge has also reviewed the specific objections made by the defendant and has found some of the objections to be supported. The judge has reduced the claimed hours worked for supplemental fees for replying to the opposition and has rounded down to the nearest tenth of an hour due to the unusual and unreasonable practice of billing in increments of one percent (0.01) of an hour.

The judge has found that a reasonable number of hours worked for this action would be a total of 43.7 hours, and has granted the motion in the reduced amount of $20,757.50.
