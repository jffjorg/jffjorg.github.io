And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion for trial preference filed by the Wallach family, who are seeking to bring their wrongful death action to trial as quickly as possible. The family's three-year-old child, Time Wallach, is a named plaintiff and has a substantial interest in the case. Under California Code of Civil Procedure section 36, the family is entitled to statutory preference for trial, which would allow them to bring their case to trial within 120 days of the preference order. However, the family is not requesting to change the current trial date of October 14, 2024, which is more than 120 days from the hearing date. The judge finds that the family's request is not justified and denies the motion without prejudice, meaning that the family can still argue the issue in court at the hearing. The judge notes that the family does not actually want to bring their case to trial under the terms of section 36, and that if the family wants to argue the issue in court, they may do so at the hearing.
