for Attorneys’ Fees

Legal
Standard
 
With respect to attorney fees and costs,
unless they are specifically provided for by statute (e.g., CCP §§ 1032, et
seq.), the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law
is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties.¿(CCP § 1021.) The
prevailing party on a contract, which specifically provides for attorney fees
and costs incurred to enforce the agreement, is entitled to reasonable attorney
fees in addition to other costs.¿(Civ. Code § 1717(a); CCP §§ 1032, 1033.5(a)(10)(A).)¿The
court, upon notice and motion by a party, shall determine the prevailing party
and shall fix, as an element of the costs of suit, the reasonable attorney
fees.¿(Civ. Code § 1717(a), (b).)¿Any notice of motion to claim attorney fees
as an element of costs under shall be served and filed before or at the same
time the memorandum of costs is served and filed; if only attorney fees are
claimed as costs, the notice of motion shall be served and filed within the
time specified in CRC 3.1700 for filing a memorandum of costs.¿(CRC 3.1702; Gunlock
Corp. v. Walk on Water, Inc. (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1303, fn. 1.) 
 
“It is well established that the
determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the
discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence
of an abuse of discretion. [Citation.]” (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64
Cal.App.3d 618, 623 624.) The fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily
“begins with the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.” (Graciano v. Robinson
Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.) “[A] computation of time
spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a
determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.” (Margolin v. Reg’l
Planning Comm’n (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.) The lodestar
figure may then be adjusted, based on consideration of factors specific to the
case, in order to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services
provided. (See Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49 [discussing
factors relevant to proper attorneys’ fees award].) Such an approach anchors
the trial court’s analysis to an objective determination of the value of the
attorney’s services, ensuring that the amount awarded is not arbitrary. (Id.
at 48, fn. 23.) The factors considered in determining the modification of the
lodestar include “(1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, (2)
the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the extent to which the nature of
the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys, (4) the contingent
nature of the fee award.” (Mountjoy v. Bank of Am. (2016) 245
Cal.App.4th 266, 271.) 
 
In challenging attorney fees as excessive
because too many hours of work are claimed, it is the burden of the challenging
party to point to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and
citations to the evidence.¿(Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v.
California Ins. Guaranty Assoc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)¿General
arguments that fees claimed are
excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice. (Ibid.) 
 
Analysis
 

Plaintiff requests $22,717.50 in
attorney fees, plus additional fees of $4,000.00.  In support of this request, Plaintiff provides
a procedural timeline of this action. During the warranty period, Plaintiff
presented the Subject Vehicle to Defendant’s authorized repair facilities on
eight separate occasions for repeated problems related to the powertrain system
in the Subject Vehicle. (Liu Decl., ¶ 4.) On June 24, 2022, Plaintiff filed
this lawsuit alleging violations of the Song-Beverly Warranty Act, among other
remedies. On August 5, 2022, Defendant filed its Answer, denying liability. On
January 4, 2023, the parties attended the initial Case Management Conference whereby
the Court set trial for November 13, 2023.
 
Plaintiff engaged in and litigated a
single set of written discovery. (Liu Decl., ¶¶ 8-17.) The parties attended an
informal discovery conference (IDC), at which the Court directed Defendant to
supplement its responses within two weeks. (¶ 16.) Rather than provide
supplemental responses, Defendant made a settlement offer on May 9, 2023, which
Plaintiff accepted on May 23, 2023. (¶¶ 17, 19-20.) Plaintiff also noticed the
deposition of Defendant’s PMK, but Defendant objected, and the deposition did
not go forward. (¶ 18.) Plaintiff unsuccessfully attempted to resolve the fees
and costs dispute informally. (¶ 20.) 
 
Plaintiff provides verified time
records of counsel for this action. (Liu Decl., ¶¶ 21-25, 42-44, Ex. 17.)
Counsel Nancy Zhang charged a rate of $490-$500 per hour for 4.6 hours of work.
Counsel Joseph Liu charged a rate of $445-$475 per hour for 40.7 hours of work.
Counsel also provides their training, education and experience as a basis for
their requested hourly rates. (¶¶ 22-25.) Counsel also attaches a US Consumer
Law Attorney Fee Survey Report 2017-2018. (Ex. 16.) The Court finds that the
requested hourly rate of $475 is reasonable in light of counsels’ experience,
education and training, and in light of the prevailing hourly rates for lemon
law counsel.
 
Preliminarily, the Court notes that
counsel occasionally billed in increments of one percent (0.01) of an hour. The
Court finds this an unusual and unreasonable practice, as this unit of time
would be 36 seconds. It is unlikely that the records are accurate to that level
of detail. Thus, the Court is therefore inclined to round down to the nearest
tenth of an hour.  In total, this
resulted in the removal of .60 hours.
 
Defendant argues that the invoices
and descriptions do not delineate tasks billed by Plaintiff’s counsel and are
therefore vague and ambiguous. Defendant makes numerous specific objections to
billing entries it believes are unreasonable, excessive or vague. Reviewing the
specific objections, the Court concurs that some of the billing entries are
ambiguous or vague. For instance, the July 6, 2022, entry regards “attention to
case file re new matter,” which does not explain what sort of “attention” was
being given to the case file. The Court also finds certain entries to be
inflated, such as the May 22, 2023, and July 17, 2023, entries for reviewing
the case file and emailing an associate.  This resulted in the removal of 1.4 hours.
 
The Court also finds that some of
the claimed supplemental fees for replying to the opposition are unreasonably
inflated. Counsel claims 1.1 hours reviewing Defendant’s opposition, 5.7 hours
drafting the reply and supporting documents, and anticipates spending an
additional 2 hours preparing for the hearing on this matter and another 1 hour
attending the hearing. (Supp. Liu Decl., ¶ 5.) Reviewing the reply papers, the
Court would not find the entirety of the 9.8 hours requested for supplemental
fees are reasonable. The Court will therefore reduce the claimed hours worked
to reflect a reasonable number of hours worked.
 
The Court finds Defendant’s other
contentions to be unsupported. Counsel did not engage in evasive or ambiguous
block-billing when describing multiple related tasks in a single entry.
Defendant’s other claims that counsel took an unreasonable amount of time to
draft and serve discovery, or that counsel engaged in
administrative/secretarial work, are likewise unsupported by the respective
time entries.
 
In light of the entirety of the
record, the Court finds that a reasonable number of hours worked for this
action would be a total of 43.7 hours. As such, the Court GRANTS the motion in
the reduced amount of $20,757.50.
