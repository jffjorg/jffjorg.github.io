MOTION:                  Motion
for Trial Preference
HEARING DATE:   2/28/2024

 
Legal
Standard
 
            Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) section
36 provides in part, “[a] civil action to recover damages for wrongful death or
personal injury shall be entitled to preference upon the motion of any party to
the action who is under 14 years of age unless the court finds that the party
does not have a substantial interest in the case as a whole. . . .” Priority is
mandatory; the trial court has no discretion to refuse the minor's request for
early setting. (Peters v. Superior Court (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d
218, 223-224.) However, early trial setting may violate a defendant's due
process rights if there is inadequate time to prepare for trial. (Id.
at 227; see also Roe v. Superior Court¿(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 642,
643;¿Peters v. Superior Court (1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 218,
227.) 
 
            “Upon the granting of such a motion
for preference, the court shall set the matter for trial not more than 120 days
from that date and there shall be no continuance beyond 120 days from the
granting of the motion for preference except for physical disability of a party
or a party's attorney, or upon a showing of good cause stated in the record. Any
continuance shall be for no more than 15 days and no more than one continuance
for physical disability may be granted to any party.” (CCP §36(f).) 
 
Analysis
 
Plaintiffs David, Time, and Elizabeth Wallach move for a
trial preference order. Time Wallach is a named plaintiff, and has a substantial
interest in the wrongful death action regarding her mother’s death. Time is
currently 3 years old, and therefore satisfies the age requirement. (Schwalbach
Decl., Ex. 1.) Plaintiffs are therefore entitled to statutory preference,
without exception. 
 
However, Plaintiffs do not request to “change the current
trial date” of October 14, 2024. They ask for an order “confirming that the
trial date will be given mandatory preference for which Time is entitled to
limit the number and length of possible trial continuances.” The Court is not
required to issue such an order under section 36. In fact, this order would
violate section 36. Under the express terms of section 36, the Court must
set trial for this matter within 120 days from any preference order. The Court cannot
continue the trial without a showing of good cause, only continue trial for 15
days at most, and may continue trial no more than once per party. (CCP §
36(f).) Plaintiffs’ requested date of October 14, 2024, is far outside of 120
days from this February 28, 2024, hearing date. Thus, Plaintiffs’ request cannot
be granted. 
 
Considering Plaintiffs’ arguments, Plaintiffs do not
actually want trial preference under section 36 at this juncture. If the Court
is incorrect on this point, Plaintiff may argue the issue at the hearing.  Otherwise, the motion is DENIED without
prejudice.
