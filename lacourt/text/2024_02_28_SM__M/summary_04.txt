And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Pro Hac Vice Application motions filed by Counsel Alex Meier and Yue Wange. Meier applies to be admitted pro hac vice as counsel of record for Plaintiffs Fanfixapp LLC and Superordinaryco USA Inc., while Wang applies to be admitted pro hac vice as counsel of record for Defendant Passes, Inc. Both applications satisfy the requirements of California Rule of Court (CRC) rule 9.40, which governs the admission of attorneys to practice pro hac vice in California. The Court notes that Meier has successfully applied to appear pro hac vice in California courts in the past two years, but warns him that he is approaching being "regularly engaged in substantial business, professional, or other activities in the State of California." Based on this analysis, the Court grants both applications for Pro Hac Vice admission.
