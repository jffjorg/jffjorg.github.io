Group  23STCV30834 
minute
order 10/11/24
plaintiff’s
ex parte application 
The
court finds that plaintiff’s ex parte application is not accompanied by a
declaration regarding notice that complies with the requirements of California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1204, subdivision (b).
The
court also finds that plaintiff has not satisfied the requirement of California Rules of Court, rule 3.1202, subdivision (c),
that an applicant for an ex parte order must make an affirmative factual
showing in a declaration containing competent testimony based on personal
knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or other statutory basis for
granting relief ex parte.  
The
court therefore denies plaintiff’s ex parte application.
The court
orders plaintiff to give notice of this order.
