And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Claudia Ascencio v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Company of Los Angeles, et al. The case involves a dispute over a used vehicle purchased from Enterprise, which allegedly had numerous defects. The plaintiff, Claudia Ascencio, has filed a petition to appoint an arbitrator to resolve the dispute, while the defendants have argued that the American Arbitration Association (AAA) is the proper forum for arbitration.

The judge has ruled in favor of the plaintiff, granting her petition to appoint an arbitrator. The parties are ordered to jointly submit the names of ten proposed arbitrators, five from the plaintiff and five from the defendants, within five days of the order. The judge notes that the defendants have misinterpreted the court's previous ruling on the motion to compel arbitration and that the plaintiff has the right to choose an alternative arbitration organization under the Retail Installment Sale Contract (RISC).
