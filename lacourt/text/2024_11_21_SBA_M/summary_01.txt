And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment in this unlawful detainer action. The plaintiff, USRE Trust, obtained title to a property in Inglewood, California through a non-judicial foreclosure sale and served a 3-Day Notice to Vacate on the defendant, Perry Howell, et al. The defendant failed to vacate the premises, and the plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment. The judge found that the plaintiff has met its initial burden to show that there is no defense to the cause of action for unlawful detainer and that the burden shifts to the defendant to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists. Since the defendant failed to provide any evidence to controvert the plaintiff's evidence, the judge granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.
