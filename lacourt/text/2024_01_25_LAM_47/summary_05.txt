Significant Statements:
  - "The Court agrees with Plaintiff that evidence of her prior lawsuit should be excluded as irrelevant under Evidence Code §§ 350 and 210 and as unduly prejudicial, confusing and time-consuming under Evidence Code § 352."
  - "The same must be said here. Evidence of Plaintiff's prior lawsuit has no probative value in assessing the strength or credibility of her claims here and does nothing to undercut or bolster her credibility in making those claims."
  - "That Plaintiff lost a previous lawsuit for discrimination against a prior employer says nothing about the righteousness of her claims here."
  - "As an alternative basis for admission, Defendants urge the Court to permit evidence of Plaintiff's prior lawsuit to prove that her emotional distress arising from Defendants' alleged misconduct complained about in August 2018 was in fact generated by her difficulties with her previous employer in her employment with the City of Los Angeles from January 2007 to April 2008."
  - "Plaintiff's allegations of misconduct by the City during 2007-2008 is sufficiently remote in time from the misconduct asserted against Defendants that it cannot be said that any such misconduct would have been an alternate, pre-existing impetus for Plaintiff's current emotional injuries."
  - "The Court concludes, therefore, that evidence of Plaintiff's prior lawsuit must be excluded."

Summary in English:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions in limine filed by the Plaintiff and Defendant. The Plaintiff seeks to exclude any evidence, testimony, or argument regarding her prior lawsuit against her former employer, while the Defendant seeks to exclude any evidence of or reference to anonymous letters about the Plaintiff's job performance.

The Judge grants the Plaintiff's motion to exclude evidence of the prior lawsuit, finding that it is irrelevant and unduly prejudicial. The Judge also notes that the evidence is not probative of any "nervousness" on the Plaintiff's part in confronting the situation that led to the recent accident.

Regarding the Defendant's motion, the Judge grants the request to exclude evidence of the anonymous letters. The Judge finds that the letters are purely inadmissible hearsay and that any substantive reference to the letters would provoke a prejudicial response in the jury.

The Judge's ruling is based on Evidence Code §§ 350 and 210, which prohibit the admission of irrelevant evidence, and Evidence Code § 352, which prohibits the admission of evidence that is unduly prejudicial, confusing, or time-consuming.
