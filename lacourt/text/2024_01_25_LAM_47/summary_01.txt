And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on several motions in limine (MIL) filed by the parties. The Judge denied Plaintiff's MIL #1, which sought to exclude all evidence not disclosed in discovery, finding that Plaintiffs failed to identify specific evidence that should be excluded and did not demonstrate a right to an exclusion order.

The Judge denied Plaintiff's MIL #2, which sought to exclude all experts not disclosed in expert disclosures and/or not produced for deposition, finding that Plaintiffs failed to offer evidence supporting their allegations of misconduct or inaction by Defendant.

The Judge denied Defendant's Ex Parte Application seeking exclusion of Plaintiffs' experts, including Housing Inspector Jose Luis Barrera, finding that Plaintiffs' expert disclosure declaration was sufficient to allow the testimony of Barrera, Rocha, and Martinez.

The Judge granted Defendant's MIL #1, which sought to bifurcate punitive damages and exclude evidence of Defendant's financial condition until after the jury makes rulings on liability, compensatory damages, and fraud, malice, or oppression.

The Judge denied Defendant's MIL #2, which sought to exclude any evidence of Plaintiffs' medical billing records, finding that the medical bills may be admissible to show the reasonable value of the medical services provided.

The Judge denied Defendant's MIL #3, which sought to exclude all settlement discussions, finding that the Court lacked evidence to determine whether the communications were sent in connection with settlement discussions or independent of any such negotiations.

The Judge granted Defendant's MIL #4, which sought to exclude all evidence and argument regarding Defendant's insurance coverage.

The Judge denied Defendant's MIL #5, which sought to exclude all evidence and argument regarding property damage, finding that Plaintiffs may testify about the nature and description of their damaged property and the amounts they paid for certain remedial products.

The Judge granted Defendant's MIL #6, which sought to exclude non-party witnesses from the courtroom.
