And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, restraining the defendants from removing the plaintiff from the rental property located at 1755 Argyle Avenue #707, Los Angeles, CA 90028 pending the resolution of the action. The judge finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated a risk of irreparable harm and a likelihood of success on the merits with respect to the first cause of action.

The plaintiff alleges that the defendants are attempting to evict him from the rental unit under color of a judgment in an unlawful detainer action, which he contends is invalid. The judge finds that the plaintiff has offered evidence that he is the named tenant on the lease agreement and that the judgment obtained in the action against the plaintiff's mother, Shala Shukran, does not apply to him.

The judge also finds that the plaintiff's approach to Code of Civil Procedure section 415.46 is more persuasive, as it produces a fairer and more just result. The plaintiff's motion is granted, and the defendants are enjoined from taking any action to remove the plaintiff from the rental property pending the resolution of the action.
