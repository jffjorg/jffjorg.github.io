And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted the plaintiffs' ex parte application to continue the hearing on the defendant's motion for summary judgment and to continue trial to a later date. The defendant's motion for summary judgment is advanced to the current date and will be continued to October 14, 2025. The plaintiffs argue that their current causes of action may be dismissed via summary judgment or at trial, and that they have not completed all necessary discovery. The Judge determines that the plaintiffs' inability to complete discovery despite diligent efforts, and the significant change in the status of the case due to the overturned caselaw, warrant a continuance. The trial date will be set at least 30 days after the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, and the parties will be referred to Department F to schedule a new trial date.
