And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Equinox Holdings, Inc., moves for an order compelling the plaintiff, Joshua Canady, to comply with the court's discovery order dated October 2, 2023, and for monetary sanctions. The defendant argues that the plaintiff failed to obey the court's order, resulting in a 6-month delay, and that the plaintiff only provided incomplete responses to discovery requests. The plaintiff argues that the defendant's motion is defective because it lacks a separate statement and a meet and confer declaration. The court finds that the defendant adequately submitted a separate statement and made efforts to informally resolve the dispute. The court grants the defendant's motion for sanctions and orders the plaintiff and his counsel to pay the defendant $2,212.50 within 20 days.
