  Case Number:  21STCV19845    Hearing Date:   May 30, 2024    Dept:  52 Cross-Defendant First American Title
Company’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings on Second Amended
Cross-Complaint
Cross-defendant
First American Title Company (FATC) moves for judgment on the pleadings on both
causes of action alleged against it by Kalousd Pandazos and Dalila Pandazos’s second
amended cross-complaint (SACC). 
Background
The
claims between these parties arise from two grant deeds involving two parcels
of real property: assessor’s
parcel numbers 5867-011-035 (parcel 35) and 5867-011-036 (parcel 36).  Parcel 35 is a strip of land along the north
side of Ridgepine Drive.  Parcel 36 is
two non-contiguous portions of land: 3.0 acres north of parcel 36 and 4.34
acres south of Ridgepine Drive.  
The first grand deed conveyed
property from Bruce R. Cook and William E. Devin III to the Pandazoses,
recorded on December 9, 2003, as instrument No. 03 3707014.  (SACC, Ex. C.)  This deed identifies the real property
conveyed as “APN 5867-011-035” but includes a legal description of metes and
bounds that contains both parcels 35 and 36. 

Second, a grant
deed purported to convey property from Cook and Devin to the Pandazoses, recorded on March 1,
2004, as instrument No. 04 0472488 (the correction deed).  (SACC, Ex. D.)  On the top left of the second page of the
deed, it states “Recording Requested By [¶] First American Title Co. of Los
Angeles.”  (Id., p. 2.)  The page titled “grant deed” is identical to
the corresponding page of the prior deed, except for changes to the date,
instrument number, and pagination, and the following text above the grantors’
signatures: “This grant deed is being re recorded to correct the legal
description.”  (Id., p. 4.)  This deed again identifies the real property
conveyed as “APN: 5867-011-035,” but the legal description by metes and bounds
contains parcel 35 and the northern 3.0 acres of parcel 36.  It omits the southern 4.34 acres of parcel
36.      
3rd Cause of Action: Slander of Title 
            The Pandazoses allege
sufficient facts for this cause of action. 
The elements of slander of title are: “(1) a publication, (2) which is
without privilege or justification, (3) which is false, and (4) which causes
direct and immediate pecuniary loss.”  (Manhattan
Loft, LLC v. Mercury Liquors, Inc. (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 1040, 1051.)  
 
FATC argues the Pandazoses do not adequately allege malice.  A plaintiff must “establish that defendant[]
acted with malice,” meaning defendant “ ‘knows that the statement is false or
acts in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity.’ ”  (Rosenaur v. Scherer (2001) 88
Cal.App.4th 260, 275.)  The SACC alleges
exactly that.  It alleges, “FIRST
AMERICAN knowing the illegal nature of the ‘correction deed’ and knowing that
both Cross-Defendants COOK-DEVINS had not signed the ‘correction deed’ … and
knowing that the ‘correction deed’ was not attached to an affidavit under
penalty of perjury by Cross-Defendants COOK-DEVINS as grantors, explaining what
the ‘correction’ was for,” FATC “deliberately and with total conscious
disregard of Cross-Complaints’ rights and interest, fraudulently recoded the illegal
‘correction deed’ with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office on March 1,
2004 as Instrument No. 04 0472488.”  (¶
41.)  It further alleges FATC’s conduct
“was a willful and fraudulent publication of a non-authorized and non-executed
instrument with an altered legal description drafted by FIRST AMERICAN’s
engineering department.”  (¶ 42.)  These portions constitute the necessary
ultimate facts that FATC knowingly requested recordation of an illegal and
invalid deed.     
FATC also contends, “There is no claim for slander of title
when ownership is disputed.”  (Motion, p.
15.)  Someone who was not an “owner[] of
the real property” cannot suffer damage from a false publication regarding
title to the property.  (Slusher v.
Buckley (1959) 174 Cal.App.2d 324, 332.) 
Here, the Pandazoses were the record owners of the subject real property
as legally described in the first grant deed recorded in December 2003.  (SACC, Ex. C.)  The alleged slander was recording the second
“correction” grant deed in March 2004.  (Id.,
Ex. D.)  There was no dispute over
ownership then.  To the contrary, the
Pandazoses allege FATC’s publication caused the dispute over
ownership.  
FATC argues the correction deed does not constitute slander
of title because “[n]one of APN 35 is being removed from the legal description.
 Rather a portion of APN 36 that was
erroneously included in the Pandazos’ original 2003 grant deed was taken out
via the corrected legal description in the 2004 corrective grant deed.”  (Reply, p. 4.)  That the correction deed purportedly reduced
the property conveyed is precisely why these factual allegations constitute
slander of title.  “If a correction instrument
‘purports to diminish the original grantee’s rights in some ways’ it ‘should
not be accepted, unless the original grantee first reconveyed to the grantor
or, at least, evidence in the record reveals her consent.’ ”  (XPO Logistics Freight, Inc. v. Hayward
Property, LLC (2022) 79 Cal.App.5th 1166, 1180.)  
Regardless of
whether the first deed’s legal description resulted from an error, it conveyed
the real property as described to the Pandazoses.  The correction deed purports to diminish the
Pandazoses’ rights because it purports to convey less of the subject property
to them.  The SACC alleges FATC “through
its engineering department, unilaterally and unbeknownst to the
Cross-Complainants and without Cross-Complainants’ affirmative consent
fraudulently re-drafted the legal description of APN 5867-011-035.”  (¶ 39.) 
Recording a second deed correcting the legal description to include less
property without the Pandazoses’ consent constitutes a false publication.      
FATC’s reliance on Thompson v. White (1886) 70 Cal.
135 is misplaced.  There, the California
Supreme Court held a nonsuit was properly granted because the publication was
privileged.  The Court stated, “[C]onsidering
the law as laid down in sections 44 to 48 of the Civil Code, inclusive”—i.e.,
the statutes governing slander, including those specifying which publications
are privileged— “we can perceive no good reason why
the defendant should have been precluded from asserting, orally or by
publication, that which he had a right to do, and was in good faith continuing
to do, in the original and pending suit, which had for its object the determination
of the question of title.”  (Id.
at p. 136.)  Here, the litigation over
title began almost two decades after the publication: the “correction” grant
deed recorded in 2004.  FATC does not
establish that, from the face of the pleadings and matters subject to judicial
notice, the publication was privileged.  
Finally, FATC argues it cannot be liable in tort for claims
arising from a preliminary title report. 
(See Siegel v. Fidelity Nat. Title Ins. Co. (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th
1181, 1191 [“no reliance should ever be placed on a preliminary report or a
policy of title insurance to show the condition of title”].)  This claim, however, does not arise from
anything FATC stated in a preliminary title report.  It arises from FATC recording the
“correction” deed.  
5th Cause of Action: Indemnity
The Pandazoses allege sufficient facts for this cause of
action.  FATC argues this cause of action
fails because it cannot stand without slander of title.  The SACC alleges sufficient facts for slander
of title and therefore also alleges sufficient facts for indemnity.
Disposition
Cross-defendant
First American Title Company’s motion for judgment on the pleadings on the
second amended cross-complaint by Kalousd Pandazos and Dalila Pandazos is denied.
