SUMMARY OF ACTION 
This is a breach of contract action arising from
an equipment financing agreement.  On
October 16, 2023, Plaintiff Financial Pacific Leasing, Inc. filed its Complaint
against Defendants Cornwall Group, Inc., Mikael Mikaelyan, and Does 1-10,
inclusive, asserting four causes of action for (1) Breach of Equipment Finance
Agreement; (2) Breach of Guaranty; (3) Account Stated; and (4) Claim and
Delivery. 
Plaintiff alleges that on
February 4, 2021, Defendants Cornwall Group, Inc. and Does 1-5  entered into a written equipment financing
agreement (the “Lease Agreement”) with Plaintiff and leased certain equipment (KL80FQ Technogen Generator Mega Silent s/n
20.63961) with Plaintiff.  (Declaration
of Janet D. Gonzales, ¶ 4; Ex.
“1.”)  To induce Plaintiff to enter into
the Lease Agreement with Defendant Cornwall, Defendant Mikael Mikaelyan and
Does 6-10, inclusive each executed in writing a Personal Guaranty (the
“Guaranty”) to the Lease Agreement.  (Id.
at ¶ 5; Ex. “1.”)  On or about
February 15, 2023, Plaintiff alleges Defendants Cornwall and Does 1-5 defaulted
pursuant to the terms of the Lease Agreement by not making the payment then
due, nor any payments due thereafter. 
Failure to make timely payments is an event of default under the terms
of the Lease Agreement.  Defendant
Cornwall failed to make any payments under the terms of the agreement.  Therefore, Defendant Cornwall and Does 1-5,
inclusive, have been in default since February 15, 2023, and are currently
delinquent of the Lease Agreement.  (Id. at ¶ 6.)   

On October 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant
applications for writ of attachment and writ of possession against Defendants
Cornwall Group, Inc. and Mikael Mikaelyan. 
Plaintiff seeks an
attachment of $37,079.61, inclusive of estimated costs of $600.00 and estimated
attorney fees of $1,348.43. Plaintiff also seeks a writ of possession for KL80FQ
Technogen Generator Mega Silent s/n 20.63961; FMV $33,000.00. 
No opposition has been filed. 
WRIT OF ATTACHMENT
Plaintiff seeks
an attachment of $37,079.61,
inclusive of
estimated costs of $600.00 and estimated
attorney fees of $1,348.43.       
Legal Standard 
“Upon the filing of the complaint or at any time
thereafter, the plaintiff may apply pursuant to this article for a right to
attach order and a writ of attachment by filing an application for the order
and writ with the court in which the action is sought.” (CCP § 484.010.)
The application shall be executed under oath and must
include: (1) a statement showing that the attachment is sought to secure the
recovery on a claim upon which an attachment may be issued; (2) a statement of
the amount to be secured by the attachment; (3) a statement that the attachment
is not sought for a purpose other than the recovery on the claim upon which the
attachment is based; (4) a statement that the applicant has no information or
belief that the claim is discharged or that the prosecution of the action is
stayed in a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. section 101 et
seq.); and (5) a description of the property to be attached under the writ of
attachment and a statement that the plaintiff is informed and believes that
such property is subject to attachment.  (CCP
§ 484.020.)
“The application [for a writ of attachment] shall be
supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff on the facts presented
would be entitled to a judgment on the claim upon which the attachment is
based.”  (CCP § 484.030.)
The court shall issue a right to attach order if the court
finds all of the following:
1.     
The claim upon which the attachment is based is one upon
which an attachment may be issued.
2.     
The plaintiff has established the probable validity of the
claim upon which the attachment is based.
3.     
The attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the
recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based.
4.     
The amount to be secured by the attachment is greater than
zero.
(CCP § 484.090.)
Discussion
1.     
Probable Validity of Claim 
“A claim has ‘probable validity’ where it is more likely
than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant on
that claim.”  (CCP § 481.190.)
This application is based on a claim for breach of the Lease
Agreement.  To establish a claim for
breach of contract, a plaintiff must prove: (1) existence of a contract, (2)
plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach of
the contract, and (4) damages incurred by plaintiff as a result of the breach.  (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 1350, 1367.)
Plaintiff submitted the declaration of its
custodian of records in support of its motion, which provides as follows.  On February 4, 2021, Defendants Cornwall
Group, Inc. and Does 1-5  entered into the
Lease Agreement with Plaintiff and leased certain equipment (KL80FQ
Technogen Generator Mega Silent s/n 20.63961) with Plaintiff.  (Gonzales Decl., ¶ 4; Ex. “1.”)  To
induce Plaintiff to enter into the Lease Agreement with Defendant Cornwall,
Defendant Mikael Mikaelyan and Does 6-10, inclusive each executed in writing a
Personal Guaranty to the Lease Agreement. 
(Id. at ¶ 5; Ex. “1.”)  On
or about February 15, 2023, Plaintiff alleges Defendant Cornwall and Does 1-5, inclusive, defaulted pursuant to the terms
of the Lease Agreement by not making the payment then due, nor any payments due
thereafter.  Failure to make timely
payments is an event of default under the terms of the Lease Agreement.  Defendant Cornwall failed to make any
payments under the terms of the agreement. 
Therefore, Defendant Cornwall and Does 1-5, inclusive, have been in
default since February 15, 2023, and are currently delinquent of the Lease
Agreement.  (Id. at ¶6.) 
In accordance with the Lease Agreement, and as a proximate result of
Defendant Cornwall’s default, Plaintiff has declared the entire balance of the
payments under the Lease Agreement to be immediately due and payable to
Plaintiff.  Pursuant to the Lease
Agreement, there became due the sum of $60,244.36 exclusive of prejudgment
interest, attorney’s fees and costs, no portion of which has been paid by
Defendant Cornwall and Does 1-5, inclusive. 
(Id. at ¶ 7.)  Plaintiff
has performed all of its obligations under the terms of the Lease Agreement,
except as excused or prevented by the conduct of Defendant Cornwall.  As a proximate cause of Defendant Cornwall’s
breach, Plaintiff has been damages in the total amount of $64,947.66 plus
prejudgment interest at the rate of 18% per annum from February 15, 2023, until
judgment is entered.  (Id. at ¶
10; Ex. “2.”)  
Based on the foregoing,
Plaintiff’s evidence is sufficient to support all elements of a breach of the Lease
Agreement against Defendants.  Plaintiff
has thus established the probable validity of its breach of the Lease Agreement.  
2.      Basis of Attachment
“[A]n attachment may be issued only in an action on a claim
or claims for money, each of which is based upon a contract, express or
implied, where the total amount of the claim or claims is a fixed or readily
ascertainable amount not less than five hundred dollars ($500) exclusive of
costs, interest, and attorney’s fees.”  (CCP
§ 483.010(a).)  “An attachment may not be
issued on a claim which is secured by any interest in real property arising
from agreement . . . .”  (CCP §
483.010(b).)
“If the action is against a defendant who is a natural
person, an attachment may be issued only on a claim which arises out of the
conduct by the defendant of a trade, business, or profession.” (CCP §
483.010(c).)  “An attachment may not be
issued on a claim against a defendant who is a natural person if the claim is
based on the sale or lease of property, a license to use property, the
furnishing of services, or the loan of money where the property sold or leased,
or licensed for use, the services furnished, or the money loaned was used by
the defendant primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.”  (Id.)
Plaintiff’s application for issuance of a writ of
attachment is based on an express contract—i.e., the Lease Agreement.  The total amount allegedly due on the
agreement is readily ascertainable and more than $500.  Plaintiff asserts (1) an unsecured amount of $31,947.66 (amount owed to Plaintiff
$64,947.66 less FMV of equipment $33,000.00); (2) interest of $3,183.52; (3)
attorneys’ fees of $1,348.43; and (4) costs of $600.00.  (Gonzales Decl., ¶¶
19-20, 22.)  Further, there are no
indications Defendant Mikaelyan holds an interest in real property to secure
the amount of the claim.  Last, Plaintiff
has demonstrated that the claim arises out of Defendant Mikaelyan’s business
based on Mikaelyan’s position as president/CEO of Defendant Cornwall and
execution of the Guaranty.  (Gonzales, ¶ 5,
Ex. “1.”)
3.     
Purpose and Amount of Attachment 
CCP § 484.090 states that the court shall issue a right to
attach order if “the attachment is not sought for a purpose other than the
recovery on the claim upon which the attachment is based . . . [and] the amount
to be secured by the attachment is greater than zero.” 
Plaintiff declares that the attachment is not sought for a
purpose other than recovery on its claim. (Application, ¶ 4.)  The amount to be secured is greater than
zero.  Plaintiff also has no information
or belief that the claim is discharged in a proceeding under Title 11 of the
United States Code or that prosecution of the action is stayed in a proceeding
under Title 11 of the United States Code. 
(Gonzales, ¶ 13; Application, ¶ 4.)
4.     
Subject Property 
CCP § 487.010(a) provides that “[w]here the defendant is a corporation,
all corporate property for which a method of levy is provided” is subject to
attachment. 
Where the defendant is a natural person, the description of the
property must be reasonably adequate to permit the defendant to identify the
specific property sought to be attached.  (CCP § 484.020(e).)  Although the property must be specifically
described, the plaintiff may target for attachment everything the individual
defendant owns.  (Bank of America v.
Salinas Nissan, Inc., (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 260, 268.)  The requirement of specificity avoids
unnecessary hearings where an individual defendant is willing to concede that
the described property is subject to attachment.  (Id.)  A general list of categories - e.g., “real
property, personal property, equipment, motor vehicles, chattel paper,
negotiable and other instruments, securities, deposit accounts, safe-deposit
boxes, accounts receivable, general intangibles, property subject to pending
actions, final money judgments, and personal property in decedents’ estates” –
is sufficient.  (Id.)
For Defendant Cornwall, the application asks for attachment
of any property of Defendant Cornwall. 
For Defendant Mikaelyan, the application asks for attachment of: (1)
property including equipment and inventory of a going business pursuant to CCP
sections 488.375 and 488.395; (2) all vehicles of a going business pursuant to
CCP section 488.385; (3) deposit accounts thereof pursuant to CCP section
488.455; and (4) any account receivable or general intangibles pursuant to CCP
section 488.470.  These descriptions of
property to attach are sufficient. 
5.     
Exemptions 
No opposition has been filed and thus no exemptions are
claimed. 
6.     
Reduction of Amount to be Secured
Because no opposition has been filed, Defendants have not
supported an attachable defense or claim for offset. 
7.     
Undertaking
CCP § 489.210 requires the plaintiff to file an undertaking
before issuance of a writ of attachment. 
Pursuant to CCP § 489.220, the amount of the undertaking will be $10,000
absent an objection.  The failure to post
an undertaking prior to the issuance of the writ of attachment renders the writ
of attachment void ab initio.  (Vershbow
v. Reiner (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 879, 883.)
Plaintiff has not addressed nor argued for a different
amount of undertaking.
8.     
Costs 
CCP § 482.110 provides the court with discretion to include an
estimated amount for costs and allowable attorney’s fees in the amount to be
secured by the attachment. 
The Lease Agreement and Guaranty provide for the payment of
reasonable attorney’s fees and costs in the event suit is instituted to enforce
the provisions thereof.  (Gonzales
Decl., ¶ 12.)  Plaintiff seeks attorney’s
fees in the amount of $1,348.43 and costs of $600.  (Id. at ¶ 22.)  However, there is no evidence to support
these amounts.  The
Court thus declines to include allowable attorney’s fees and costs in the
amount to be secured by the attachment.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s application for a writ of attachment is
TENTATIVELY GRANTED in the reduced amount of $35,131.18 subject to Plaintiff
posting the required undertaking in the amount of $10,000.00 within 30
days.  The Court sets an Order to Show
Cause re: posting of the undertaking on April 17, 2024.  The Court notes the OSC will be discharged if
the undertaking is posted and the writ issued. 

WRIT OF POSSESSION
Plaintiff also seeks a writ of possession
for KL80FQ
Technogen Generator Mega Silent s/n 20.63961.
Legal Standard 
“Upon the filing of the complaint or at any time
thereafter, the plaintiff may apply pursuant to this chapter for a writ of
possession by filing a written application for the writ with the court in which
the action is brought.” (CCP § 512.010(a).)
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 512.010(b), the
application must be submitted under oath and include:
(1)   A
showing of the basis of the plaintiff's claim and that the plaintiff is
entitled to possession of the property claimed. 
If the basis of the plaintiff's claim is a written instrument, a copy of
the instrument shall be attached.
 
(2)   A
showing that the property is wrongfully detained by the defendant, of the
manner in which the defendant came into possession of the property, and,
according to the best knowledge, information, and belief of the plaintiff, of
the reason for the detention.
 
(3)   A
particular description of the property and a statement of its value.
 
(4)   A
statement, according to the best knowledge, information, and belief of the
plaintiff, of the location of the property and, if the property, or some part
of it, is within a private place which may have to be entered to take
possession, a showing that there is probable cause to believe that such
property is located there.
 
(5)   A
statement that the property has not been taken for a tax, assessment, or fine,
pursuant to a statute; or seized under an execution against the property of the
plaintiff; or, if so seized, that it is by statute exempt from such seizure.
Before the hearing on the Writ of Possession, the defendant
must be served with (1) a copy of the summons and complaint; (2) a Notice of
Application and Hearing; and (3) a copy of the application and any affidavit in
support thereof.  (CCP § 512.030.)
“The writ will be issued if the court finds that the
plaintiff's claim is probably valid and the other requirements for issuing the
writ are established.”  (CCP §
512.040(b).) 
Prior to the issuance of a writ of possession, the
Plaintiff must file an undertaking “in an amount not less than twice the value
of the defendant's interest in the property or in a greater amount.” (CCP §
515.010(a).)
Discussion
Plaintiff has applied for a writ of possession of certain
equipment (KL80FQ
Technogen Generator Mega Silent s/n 20.63961. 
Plaintiff alleged a cause of action for claim
and delivery of this equipment in its Complaint.  (Compl. ¶¶ 20-26.)  Further, Plaintiff has personally served
Defendants with the requisite papers.  However,
the Court finds Plaintiff has not followed the statutory requirements of CCP § 512.010.  In particular, section eight of
Plaintiff’s application fails to identify “that the property has not been taken
for a tax, assessment, or fine” or “seized under an execution against the
property of the plaintiff[.]” (CCP § 512.010(b).)
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s application for a writ of possession is DENIED
without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION
Plaintiff’s application for a writ of attachment is TENTATIVELY
GRANTED in the reduced amount of $35,131.18 subject to Plaintiff posting the
required undertaking in the amount of $10,000.00 within 30 days.  The Court sets an Order to Show Cause re:
posting of the undertaking on April 17, 2024. 
The Court notes the OSC will be discharged if the undertaking is posted
and the writ issued.  
Plaintiff’s application for a writ of possession is DENIED without
prejudice.
