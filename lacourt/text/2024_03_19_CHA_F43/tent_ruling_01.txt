SUMMARY
OF ACTION
On
September 26, 2023, Plaintiff Rico Ellis (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendants Exeter Finance, LLC (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 5, asserting
causes of action for (1) negligence, (2) fraud, and (3) conversion. 
 
The
Complaint alleges the following. 
 
On
or around October 11, 2021, Plaintiff purchased a 2018 Hyundai Ioniq vehicle financed
by Defendant. (Compl., ¶ 6.)  
 
On or around “2016”
(even though the vehicle is a “2018” vehicle and bought in “2021”), in Texas, Plaintiff
received a citation (the Complaint does not explain the reason for the
citation). (Compl., ¶ 7.) 
 
On or around
July 23, 2023, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department pulled Plaintiff over,
informed him that a $20 administration fee associated with the 2016 Texas
citation remained outstanding (despite Plaintiff’s receipt showing the fee had
been paid), and impounded the vehicle. (Compl., ¶¶ 8-10.) 
 
On or around
August 10, 2023, the defendants told Plaintiff they could retrieve his vehicle
on his behalf to preclude additional fees, liens, and sales. (Compl., ¶ 12.)
 
Despite those
representations, the fact that Plaintiff had been making payments on his car
note, and Plaintiff was not in breach of his contractual obligations, the
defendants, on or around August 10, 2023, sent Plaintiff a letter titled Notice
of Our Plan to Sell Property, informing him that they will sell his vehicle at
a private sale in August 2023 because Plaintiff had “broken promises in [the parties’]
agreement.” (Compl., ¶¶ 14-17.)
 
Despite
Plaintiff sending the defendants letters to cease the sale of his vehicle, on
or around September 1, 2023, the defendants sold his vehicle and reported the
repossession to Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, making it difficult for
Plaintiff to obtain credit from lending institutions. (Compl., ¶¶ 14-17.)
 
On November 6,
2023, Defendant filed its Answer to the Complaint. 
 
On November
14, 2023, Plaintiff filed the instant demurrer to the Answer. 
 
On February 8,
2024, Defendant filed its pending Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Action
set for hearing on April 30, 2024. 
 
On March 6,
2024, Exeter Finance filed its opposition to the demurrer. 
 
As of March
16, 2024, no reply to the opposition has been filed. 
 
ANALYSIS
Requests
for Judicial Notice: No requests for judicial notice have been filed. 
 
Evidentiary
Objections: No evidentiary objections have been filed. 
 
Summary
of Arguments
 
Plaintiff
argues the following in his moving papers. None of the affirmative defenses in Defendant’s
Answer state facts sufficient to constitute a defense to the Complaint or any
cause of action in the Complaint. In addition, all of the defenses are
uncertain. Each affirmative defense is nothing more than terse conclusions of
law without any factual support. Accordingly, the Court should sustain the demurrer,
and the Defendant should be ordered to file an amended answer.  
 
In
its opposition, Defendant argues the following. The parties’ contract contains
an arbitration provision requiring Plaintiff to arbitrate his claims. Given
that arbitration agreement, the Court is not the right forum to adjudicate the
sufficiency of Defendant’s affirmative defenses. Therefore, Defendant asks the
Court to defer its ruling on the demurrer until the Court has heard Defendant’s
motion to compel arbitration. If the Court decides to consider the demurrer on
its merits, then the Court should overrule the demurrer for two reasons. First,
Defendant has pleaded its affirmative defenses with as much factual specificity
as necessary. Second, leave to amend must be liberally granted should the Court
find the Answer insufficient. 
 
Case Law
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.20 provides: “A
party against whom an answer has been filed may object, by demurrer …, to the
answer upon any or more of the following grounds: ¶ (a) The answer does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a defense. ¶ (b) The answer is uncertain.
As used in this subdivision, ‘uncertain’ includes ambiguous and unintelligible.”
 
“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed,
even where a complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can
be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of Cal.,
Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Such demurrers “are disfavored, and
are granted only if the pleading is so incomprehensible that a defendant cannot
reasonably respond.” (Mahan v. Charles W. Chan Insurance Agency, Inc. (2017)
14 Cal.App.5th 841, 848.)          
 
“The granting or refusing of leave to amend an answer
is within the sound discretion of the court. Such discretion will seldom be
disturbed where exercised for the purpose of allowing the true facts to be
alleged.” (Hyman v. Tarplee (1944) 64 Cal.App.2d 805, 813.) “The rule
that the court should be liberal in allowing amendments when they do not
seriously impair the rights of the opposite party is particularly applicable to
answers.” (Id. at pp. 813-814.)
 
Application to Case
 
The ruling on Defendant’s Motion to Compel Arbitration and
Stay Action may render the demurrer moot. 
 
Accordingly, the Court will continue the demurrer
hearing to the same date as the hearing on Defendant’s motion.  
 
Conclusion
The
demurrer hearing is CONTINUED to April 30, 2024, at 8:30 a.m., Dept. F43, Chatsworth
Courthouse. Defendant
Exeter Finance LLC’s Motion to
Compel Arbitration and Stay Action shall be heard first, followed by the
demurrer.
