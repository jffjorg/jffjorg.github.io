BACKGROUND
                
On February 17, 2022, Plaintiff John GD
Doe sued Defendant Paramount Unified School District, asserting causes of
action for (1) sexual assault; (2) negligence; (3) negligent failure to
educate, train or warn; and (4) violation of Unruh. Plaintiff alleges he was
sexually abused by his eighth-grade teacher while a student at Paramount
Unified School District.
 
 
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
A defendant may move for judgment on
the pleadings when the “complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute
a cause of action against that defendant.”  (CCP § §§ 438(b)(1) and
(c)(1)(B)(ii).)  The grounds for motion provided for in this section shall
appear on the face of the challenged pleading or from any matter of which the
court is required to take judicial notice.  (CCP § 438(d).) 
Presentation of extrinsic evidence is therefore not proper on a motion for
judgment on the pleadings.  (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998)
67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999.)
 
Defendant asserts that Plaintiff’s complaint fails because Plaintiff did
comply with the claim presentation requirements of the Government Claims Act. 
 
 The California Legislature passed
AB 218 in 2019; that statute amended the Government Claims Act to exempt from
the claim presentation requirements “[c]laims made pursuant to Section 340.1 of
the Code of Civil Procedure for the recovery of damages suffered as a result of
childhood sexual assault” regardless of the date the wrongful conduct occurred.
Prior to AB 218, only claims that occurred after January 1, 2009 were exempt.
Under AB 218, Plaintiff was not required to comply with the claim presentation
requirements.
 
Defendant asserts that Plaintiff still was required to comply with the
Government Claims Act because AB 218 violates the California Constitution by
retroactively imposing liability on a past occurrence. Defendant cites cases
published before 1930 and ignores recent authority rejecting Defendant’s
arguments. (See Coats v. New Haven Unified School District (2020) 46
Cal.App.5th 415, 425-31 [rejecting constitutional challenges to AB 218].) The
motion cannot be granted on this basis.
 
Defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings is DENIED.
