And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: one to quash a subpoena for employment records and another to compel further responses to discovery requests.

In the first motion, the plaintiff seeks to quash a subpoena served by the defendant on the plaintiff's current employer, Sodexo, Inc. The subpoena requests all documents and communications referencing or relating to the plaintiff's employment with Sodexo, Inc. The plaintiff objects to the subpoena on grounds of privacy and overbreadth, but the defendant argues that the subpoena is necessary to determine the nature of the plaintiff's subsequent work and whether it was proper mitigation. The judge grants the plaintiff's motion, finding that the plaintiff has agreed to Sodexo's production of certain documents and that the remaining issue is whether Sodexo must produce records showing the number of hours the plaintiff worked. The judge sees no reason to require Sodexo to produce any more than what the plaintiff has agreed to.

In the second motion, the defendant seeks to compel further responses to discovery requests, specifically a deposition training video viewed by the plaintiff prior to her deposition. The plaintiff objected on grounds of privacy, attorney work product, and relevance, but the defendant argues that the video is relevant to know what the instructions were and how they may have affected the plaintiff's testimony and credibility. The judge denies the motion, finding that the defendant has not shown that the video is relevant or reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence. The judge also notes that the defendant has not established that the video contains any information specifically concerning this case.
