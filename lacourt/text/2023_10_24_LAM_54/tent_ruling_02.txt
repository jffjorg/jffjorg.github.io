BACKGROUND
                
On February 28, 2022, Plaintiff Sheila Sansano sued Defendant Kaiser
Foundation Hospitals, asserting causes of action for (1) discrimination; (2)
harassment; (3) retaliation; (4) failure to prevent discrimination, harassment,
and retaliation; (5) wrongful termination in violation of public policy; (6)
whistleblower retaliation; (7) breach of oral contract; and (8) breach of
implied-in-fact contract. 
 
Plaintiff, a Filipino woman, alleges Defendant terminated her employment
as the Director of Food and Nutrition Services on the basis of her race,
national origin, and gender, and for reporting instances of discrimination and
harassment.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“If a subpoena requires the attendance of a witness or the production of
books, documents, electronically stored information, or other things before a
court, or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition,
the court, upon motion reasonably made by any person described in subdivision
(b), or upon the court's own motion after giving counsel notice and an
opportunity to be heard, may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely,
modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as
the court shall declare, including protective orders. In addition, the court
may make any other order as may be appropriate to protect the person from
unreasonable or oppressive demands, including unreasonable violations of the
right of privacy of the person.”  (CCP §
1987.1(a).) A motion to quash subpoena must be accompanied by a separate
statement. (CRC Rule 3.1345(a)(5).)
 
Plaintiff moves to quash the subpoena served on Plaintiff’s current
employer, Sodexo, Inc. by Defendant on August 11, 2023. The subpoena requests all documents and/or communications referencing
or relating to Plaintiff employment with Sodexo, Inc.
Plaintiff asserts the subpoena infringes her
right to privacy and is overbroad.
 
In opposition, Defendant
represents that Plaintiff has agreed not to object to Sodexo’s production of
documents referring or relating to: (a) Plaintiff’s complete payroll records,
including but not limited to wage statements; (b) tax records reflecting Plaintiff’s
income; and (c) all benefits offered to Plaintiff, and all benefits received by
Plaintiff, including insurance, retirement, and pension. 
 
The only remaining issue is whether
Sodexo must produce records that show the number of hours Plaintiff worked.
Defendant asserts these records are necessary to determine the nature of
Plaintiff’s subsequent work (full time vs. part time), whether it was proper
mitigation, what Plaintiff’s rate of pay was, and to allow its expert to make
an “apples-to-apples" comparison. In reply, Plaintiff asserts her wage
statements already contain this information.
 
The Court sees no reason to
require Sodexo to produce any more than what Plaintiff has agreed to.
Plaintiff’s complete payroll records will provide Defendant with the
information Defendant seeks. Plaintiff’s motion is GRANTED.

Motion to

T/R:      DEFENDANT’S MOTION IS DENIED.
 
DEFENDANT TO NOTICE. 
 
If the parties

counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the hearing.
 
The Court considers the moving papers, opposition, and reply.
 
BACKGROUND
                
On February 28, 2022, Plaintiff Sheila Sansano sued Defendant Kaiser
Foundation Hospitals, asserting causes of action for (1) discrimination; (2)
harassment; (3) retaliation; (4) failure to prevent discrimination, harassment,
and retaliation; (5) wrongful termination in violation of public policy; (6)
whistleblower retaliation; (7) breach of oral contract; and (8) breach of
implied-in-fact contract. 
 
Plaintiff, a Filipino woman, alleges Defendant terminated her employment
as the Director of Food and Nutrition Services on the basis of her race,
national origin, and gender, and for reporting instances of discrimination and
harassment.
ANALYSIS
 
The moving party on a motion to compel
further responses to requests for production of documents (“RPDs”) must submit
“specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the
inspection demand.”  (CCP §
2031.310(b)(1).)  If the moving party has
shown good cause for the RPDs, the burden is on the objecting party to justify
the objections.  (Kirkland v. Sup.Ct
(2002) 95 Cal. App.4th 92, 98.)
 
Defendant moves to compel further
response to RPD no. 70, which requests Plaintiff produce a deposition training
video she viewed prior to her deposition. Plaintiff objected on the grounds of
privacy, attorney work product, and relevance. Defendant asserts the video is
relevant to know what the instructions were and how they may
have affected Plaintiff’s testimony and credibility. 
 
Plaintiff previously moved ex parte to redact portions of her
deposition testimony that referred to the video on the grounds that they are
protected by the attorney-client privilege and attorney work product. The Court
denied the ex parte, noting that Plaintiff’s counsel failed to object to
the questions at deposition, waiving any privilege or work product objection to
those questions under Code of Civil Procedure § 2025.460 (a).
 
Defendant asserts that this ruling shows that the entire video is
discoverable. The Court disagrees. Defendant has not shown that the video is
relevant or reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence. Defendant has
not established, for example, that Plaintiff’s deposition testimony was unusual
in some way or that her substantive answers were improperly influenced by this
video. It appears undisputed that the video does not contain any information specifically
concerning this case. The Court sees no reason to require that Plaintiff’s
counsel produce a generic video on deposition conduct. 
 
Defendant’s motion is DENIED.
