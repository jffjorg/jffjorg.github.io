And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge, Maurice A. Leiter, has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The defendant, Paramount Unified School District, had argued that the plaintiff, John GD Doe, did not comply with the claim presentation requirements of the Government Claims Act. However, the judge found that the defendant's argument was based on a misunderstanding of the law, specifically the California legislature's passage of AB 218 in 2019, which exempted claims made by victims of childhood sexual assault from the claim presentation requirements. The judge noted that the defendant's arguments were not supported by recent authority and that the motion was denied.
