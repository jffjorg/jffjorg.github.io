COUNSEL TO NOTICE.
 
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received.
 
The Court may issue an order allowing
an attorney to withdraw from representation, after notice to the client.  (CCP § 284.) 
The attorney may withdraw from representation where the withdrawal would
not result in undue prejudice to the client’s interest—for example, counsel
cannot withdraw at a critical point in the litigation.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.
App. 4th 904, 915; see California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-700.) 
 
Brian P. Kamel & Associates seek to
withdraw from representation of Defendant Kendren Community
Health Center, Inc. Counsel
states that the attorney-client relationship has broken down. Trial is not yet
set; no prejudice will result from counsel’s withdrawal. Counsel has complied
with CRC 3.1362.
 
There is good cause for counsel’s
withdrawal. The motion is GRANTED.
