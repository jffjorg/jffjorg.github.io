And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Brian P. Kamel & Associates, counsel for the defendant Kendren Community Health Center, Inc., to withdraw from representation. The motion is granted because there is good cause for the withdrawal, and no prejudice will result from the withdrawal since trial is not yet set. The court notes that the attorney-client relationship has broken down, and counsel has complied with the necessary procedures. Counsel is ordered to file proof of service of the order on the defendant within 5 days of notice of the ruling, and will be relieved from representation upon filing of proof of service of the order.
