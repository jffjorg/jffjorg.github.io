And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted in part Plaintiff Eblin Guerra's motion for attorney's fees and costs. The court has awarded Plaintiff $48,750.00 in attorney's fees and $7,793.69 in costs. The court has also denied Plaintiff's request for an enhancement multiplier of 1.5 and applied a negative multiplier of 0.5 to the base lodestar amount. The court has found that Plaintiff was the prevailing party in the case and is entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs. The court has also found that the hourly rate of $650.00 per hour is reasonable and has awarded Plaintiff 150 hours of attorney time. The court has reduced the number of hours reasonably expended due to the complexity of the case and the efficiency of Plaintiff's counsel. The court has also noted that Defendant's request for a negative multiplier is well-placed due to the fact that Plaintiff failed to prove many of his claims and that the case was over-pled and over-litigated.
