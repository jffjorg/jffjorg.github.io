And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by Defendant General Motors, LLC. The Plaintiff, Jenny Garcia, brought a lawsuit against General Motors alleging that the company knew about engine defects in its 2020 Chevrolet Silverados but failed to disclose this information to consumers.

The Judge ruled that the demurrer filed by General Motors is OVERRULED in its entirety, meaning that the Plaintiff's claims for breach of implied warranty, breach of express warranty, fraudulent concealment, and violation of the CLRA will proceed. The Judge found that the Plaintiff has adequately pled delayed discovery, pled all elements of fraud with specificity, and alleged a duty to disclose.

The Judge also denied General Motors' motion to strike the Plaintiff's demand for punitive damages, finding that the Plaintiff has alleged facts that could support an award of punitive damages if proven at trial.

The Judge ordered General Motors to file an answer to the First Amended Complaint within 21 days and ordered the Plaintiff to give notice unless waived. The Judge's tentative ruling is subject to change pending any further submissions from the parties.
