  Case Number:  23AHCV02126    Hearing Date:   April 29, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE]
ORDER SUSTAINING DEMURRER TO THE FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION WITH LEAVE TO AMEND I.        INTRODUCTION
           In this wrongful death action, Plaintiffs James P.
Pollerana, Deanna Pollerana  and James D.
Pollerana (collectively Plaintiffs) allege that decedent Anna Pollerana was
struck and killed by a speeding car on September 8, 2022, while she was crossing
the street. The complaint contains three causes of action: (1) wrongful death,
dangerous condition of public property; (2) negligence-failure to warn and (3)
negligent entrustment.
           The first cause of action is alleged against the government
entities, the second and third causes of action are alleged against the
individual defendants.
           Pasadena filed the instant demurrer on December 8, 2023. Plaintiffs
filed an opposition on April 16, 2024. Pasadena filed a reply on April 22,
2024.
Before
the Court are Pasadena’s challenges to the first cause of action. Pasadena
alleges that the first cause of action fails for failure to state sufficient
facts.
           The demurrer is sustained
with leave to amend. 
II.       DEMURRER
A. Legal Standard
Code
Civ. Proc. Section 430.10(e) provides for a demurrer on the basis that a
complaint fails to state a cause of action. (CCP § 430.10(e).) A demurrer tests
the legal sufficiency of a complaint. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)  A demurrer is treated as “admitting all
material facts properly pleaded,” but not the truth of “contentions, deductions
or conclusions of law.” (Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2
Cal.4th 962, 966-967.) The general rule on demurrer is that the pleadings are
“deemed to be true, however improbable they may be.” (Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.4th 593, 604.) 
Questions
of plaintiff’s ability to prove unlikely allegations are of no concern. (Committee
on Children’s Television, Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197,
213-214.)
Allegations
need not be accepted as true if they are contradicted by judicially noticeable
facts. (Cansino v. Bank of America (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1462,
1474.) 
“We
treat the demurrer as admitting all the properly pleaded material facts and
consider matters which may be judicially noticed, but we do not treat as
admitted contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. (Align
Technology, Inc. v. Tran (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 949, 958 [102 Cal.Rptr.3d
343].) Further, ‘ “ ‘we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading
it as a whole and its parts in their context.’ ”’ (Ibid.) Because a
demurrer tests only the legal sufficiency of the pleading, we accept as true
even the most improbable alleged facts, and we do not concern ourselves with
the plaintiff's ability to prove its factual allegations. (Ibid.)
‘“Facts appearing in exhibits attached to the first amended complaint also are
accepted as true and are given precedence, to the extent they contradict the
allegations.”’ (Paul v. Patton (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 1088, 1091.)
Although a demurrer does not ordinarily reach affirmative defenses, it ‘“will
lie where the complaint ‘has included allegations that clearly disclose some
defense or bar to recovery.’ ”’ (Casterson v. Superior Court (2002) 101
Cal.App.4th 177, 183, Nolte v. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (2015) 236
Cal.App.4th 1401, 1406. )
           B. Meet and Confer Requirement Met
           The Declaration of Caroline Monroy is offered in support
of counsel’s compliance with Code Civ. Proc. Section 430.41. Monroy declares
that she met and conferred with plaintiff’s counsel via video conference on
November 22, 2023. (Monroy Decl. ¶ 4, referencing Exh. A.) She declares that
the parties were unable to reach a resolution. (Monroy Decl. ¶ 5.)
The
meet and confer requirement was met. 
           C. Demurrer to the First Cause of Action for Dangerous
Condition of Public Property
Paragraph
14 of the Complaint provides that Defendants owned, maintained, or otherwise
controlled the traffic signs at Marengo Avenue. (Complaint ¶ 14.) ¶ 15 alleges
that on September 18, 2022, the intersection was a dangerous condition due to
the lack of traffic control measures such as speed bumps and signs and that
there was a failure to warn against an non-obvious trap. (¶ 15.) ¶ 15 also
alleges that Marengo Avenue is a heavily travelled street where people drive
fast. (Complaint ¶ 15.) ¶ 16 provides that Defendants had actual or
constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition; ¶ 17 alleges that decedent
Anna Pollerana died because of the dangerous condition. (Complaint ¶¶ 16,17.)
Pasadena
demurs on the grounds that Plaintiffs’ cause of action for premises liability cannot
be asserted as the conditions alleged are not dangerous conditions. (Demurrer
p. 7: 7-13.) In support, Pasadena cites Government Code Sections 830.4 and
830.8. Government Code Section 830.4 provides “[a] condition is not a dangerous
condition within the meaning of this chapter merely because of the
failure to provide regulatory traffic control signals, stop signs, yield
right-of-way signs, or speed restriction signs.” (GC § 830.4, emphasis added.)
Government Code Section 830.8 provides “[n]either a public entity nor a public
employee is liable under this chapter for an injury caused by the failure to
provide traffic or warning signals, signs, markings or devices.” (GC § 830.8.)
Pasadena also cites Brenner v. City of El Cajon for the proposition that
a demurrer may be sustained without leave to amend if the complaint fails to
plead around sign immunity under Government Code Sections 830.4 and 830.8. (See
Brenner v. City of El Cajon (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 434, 436-437.) 
To
plead around sign immunity, a Plaintiff must allege that the government entity failed
to provide a sign or other device necessary to warn of a non-obvious and
concealed trap. (See GC § 830.8.) Such allegations must be specific as to how
the specific condition is a dangerous condition and cannot rely on generalized
allegations. (Mixon v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (2012) 207
Cal.App.4th 124,131.) “A plaintiff's allegations, and ultimately the evidence,
must establish a physical deficiency in the property itself.”
(Huerta v. City of Santa Ana (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 41, 48.) Heavy use of
the road at issue is not a physical deficiency by itself. (See Brenner,
supra, 113 Cal.App.4th at 440; Mittenhuber v. City of Redondo Beach (1983)
142 Cal.App.3d 1, 7; Antenor v. City of Los Angeles (1985) 174
Cal.App.3d 477, 483-485.) Here, the complaint alleges “failure to warn against
a non-obvious and concealed trap” but does not specify what the alleged trap
was. The complaint does not identify a physical deficiency beyond the lack of
traffic control measures for which liability is barred by Government Code
Sections 830.4 and 830.8, heavy use of the street and improper maintenance.
(See GC §§ 830.4, 830.8, Brenner v. City of El Cajon (2003) 113
Cal.App.4th 434, 436, 440; Mittenhuber v. City of Redondo Beach (1983)
142 Cal.App.3d 1,7.) These deficiencies are not solved in Plaintiff's
opposition. (See Opposition p. 7-8.)
However,
the issue of specific factual allegations may be solved on amendment. Indeed,
the Complaint has not yet been amended. The demurrer is sustained with leave to
amend.
