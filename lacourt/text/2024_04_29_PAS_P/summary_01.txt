And here is the English summary:

The judge, Jared D. Moses, issued a tentative ruling in a wrongful death case, sustaining City of Pasadena's demurrer to the first cause of action with leave to amend. The case involves the wrongful death of Anna Pollerana, who was struck and killed by a speeding car on September 8, 2022. The complaint alleges that City of Pasadena is liable for the dangerous condition of public property, specifically the lack of traffic control measures and failure to warn against a non-obvious and concealed trap. City of Pasadena demurred to the first cause of action, arguing that the complaint fails to plead around sign immunity under Government Code Sections 830.4 and 830.8. The judge ruled that the complaint fails to plead a physical deficiency in the property itself and relies on generalized allegations. The demurrer is sustained with leave to amend, giving Plaintiffs 20 days to file a first amended complaint.
