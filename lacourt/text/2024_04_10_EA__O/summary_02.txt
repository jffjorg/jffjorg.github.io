The Judge's tentative ruling is based on information presented prior to the court hearing. The case involves a dispute between the Plaintiffs and the Defendant/Cross-Defendant over allegations of fraud and mismanagement of Heritage, a company. The Defendant/Cross-Defendant alleges that the Plaintiffs spent and took large amounts of money from Heritage and misrepresented transactions in the company books and records. However, the Defendant's cross-complaint does not contain sufficient evidence to support these allegations. The Judge notes that the case requires proof of specific transactions and dates to substantiate the claims. The Judge's ruling is pending further evidence and argument from both parties.
