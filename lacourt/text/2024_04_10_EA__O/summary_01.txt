And here is the English-text summary:

The court's tentative ruling reduces the bond amount from $313,194.73 to $15,000.00, considering that Defendant's potential damages are minimal. The court notes that the initial bond amount was excessive and unreasonable in light of the corporation's inability to conduct business. The court also notes that there is no opposition to the reduction of the bond amount, and therefore, the court may impose no bond due to the corporation's lack of assets or money.
