 Case Number:  23AHCV01901    Hearing Date:   June 12, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING ATTORNEY
THOMAS F. NOWLAND'S MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS ATTORNEY OF RECORD FOR DEFENDANT
CRITICAL CLIMATE, INC.


The Court may issue an
order allowing an attorney to withdraw from representation after notice to the
client. (CCP § 284.) The attorney may withdraw from representation as long as the
withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice to the client's interest—i.e.,
counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in the litigation. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915;
see California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-700.) 
Attorney Thomas F. Nowland seeks to be
relieved as counsel for Defendant Critical Climate, Inc. Mr. Nowland asserts
that he is seeking to withdraw because the attorney-client relationship is
irretrievably broken. Specifically, he declares that Critical Climate is
“consistently uncooperative with Counsel” and is in breach of the retainer
agreement. (MC-052 Item 2.) The motion is unopposed. Mr. Nowland has complied
with all procedural requirements, including giving notice of this hearing to
his client.
 The next hearing in this case is a status
conference on October 4, 2024. As Critical Climate is an entity, it cannot
represent itself at this hearing and must find new counsel before October. The
motion was filed 3/29/24, giving Critical Climate plenty of time to find new
counsel or to oppose. Therefore, this is not a critical point in the
litigation.
 THE MOTION IS GRANTED. COUNSEL IS TO FILE
PROOF OF SERVICE OF ORDER ON PLAINTIFF WITHIN 5 DAYS OF NOTICE OF RULING.
COUNSEL WILL BE RELIEVED UPON FILING OF PROOF OF SERVICE OF ORDER.
