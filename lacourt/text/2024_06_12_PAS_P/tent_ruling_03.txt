           This is a case for personal injury
and other damages filed by Chris Szajner (Szajner) arising from an alleged bed
bug infestation in his hotel room. He sues Defendants Hilton Worldwide Holdings
Inc., Park Hotels and Resorts Inc., 
Hilton Garden Inn Arcadia/Pasadena area, and individual Pedro Figueroa
for these injuries, arising out of his stay at the Hilton Garden Inn in Arcadia
in February-March of 2021. He alleges he awoke on February 12, 2021 with a rash
and bug bites. He alleges he changed rooms but the problem persisted. On March
10, 2021, he sought medical treatment and was diagnosed with bedbug bites. The
amended complaint contains seven causes of action: (1) Battery, (2) Negligence,  (3)Intentional Infliction of Emotional
Distress, (4) Fraudulent Concealment, (5) Private Nuisance, (6) Public Nuisance,
and (7) Breach of Contract. 
           This complaint was filed on February 9, 2023. On December
12, 2023, Plaintiff Szajner indicated that he was still attempting to serve the
defendants in this case. Szajner filed a proof of service as to Hilton on March
21, 2024, indicating that Hilton was served by personal service in Delaware. On
April 2, 2024, Defendant Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (Hilton) filed a motion
to quash service of summons. Plaintiff filed an opposition on May 30, 2024. Hilton
filed a reply on June 4, 2024.
           The Court grants Hilton’s Motion to Quash Service of
Summons.
II.       LEGAL
STANDARD
           Code Civ. Proc. §418.10(a)(1) provides that a defendant,
on or before the last day to plead, may file a motion to quash service of the
summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. 
California’s “long-arm”
statute provides for jurisdiction “on any basis not inconsistent with the
Constitution of this state or of the United States.” Code Civ. Proc.
§410.10. 
The possible bases for
jurisdiction in this state are the following: 
- Physical presence in the
forum when served, aka “gotcha” jurisdiction; Burnham v. Superior Court
(1990) 495 U.S. 604, 612; 
- Domicile in the forum
state; Milliken v. Meyer (1940) 311 U.S. 457, 462; 
- General appearance in the
action; Code Civ. Proc. §410.50(a); 
- Contractual consent/forum
selection clause; National Equipment Rental, Ltd. v. Szukhent (1964) 375
U.S. 311, 315-316; 
- Minimum contacts; International
Shoe Co. v. State of Washington (1945) 326 U.S. 310, 316; Burger King v.
Rudzewicz (1985) 471 U.S. 462, 475. 
See Weil & Brown, Cal.
Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023),
¶3:131. 
           CCP
Section 581 provides that an action may be dismissed without prejudice as to a defendant
if the motion is made pursuant to CCP Section 418.10. (CCP § 581.) 
 
III.     ANALYSIS
           a. General Jurisdiction
To
exercise general jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant, there must be such
minimum contacts between the defendant and the forum state that the exercise of
personal jurisdiction is allowed. (International Shoe Co. v. State of
Washington (1945) 326 U.S. 310, 316; Burger King v. Rudzewicz (1985)
471 U.S. 462, 475.) Here, Hilton urges that this is not the case. In support, Hilton
provides the declaration of its vice president and assistant secretary, James
O. Smith. (Smith Declaration.) He declares that Hilton is a Delaware
corporation with its principal place of business in Virginia. It does not and
did not own, operate, lease, manage the Arcadia Hilton Garden Inn property. (Smith
Declaration ¶ 4.) Additionally, Hilton is not a franchisor of the Property,
does not employ persons at the subject property nor has responsibility for the
property. (Id.) Lastly, he declares that Hilton does not conduct any continuous
or systematic business activities in California. (Smith Declaration ¶ 4.)
           In his opposition, Plaintiff does
not offer any evidence that this Court has jurisdiction over Hilton. Instead,
Plaintiff urges that “Counsel for Defendant did not attempt to meet and confer
with Plaintiff’s counsel regarding the present matter.” (Opposition p. 1: 24-26.)
However, there is no meet and confer requirement before filing a CCP Section
418.10 motion. 
As Plaintiff does not offer any evidence to support
the Court’s exercise of jurisdiction, and the Defendant has offered evidence to
the contrary, the Court finds that it cannot exercise general jurisdiction over
Hilton. (See Doe v. Roman
Catholic Archbishop of Cashel & Emly (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 209, 217,
referencing Vons Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Foods, Inc. (1996) 14 Cal.4th
434, 449.)
b.
Specific Jurisdiction
To
exercise specific personal jurisdiction over a defendant, there must be a
substantial connection with a business relationship defendant has purposefully
formed with California. (Vons Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Foods, Inc.
(1996) 14 Cal.4th 434, 448.) Here, Hilton urges that this is not the case. Despite
Plaintiff’s allegations that Hilton owns and operates the subject property, Hilton
urges that it does not. In support, Hilton provides the declaration of its vice
president and assistant secretary, as described above. Its attorney declares
that Hilton does not own, lease, operate, manage, occupy, or control the
Arcadia Hilton Garden Inn property. (Smith Decl. ¶ 4.) He further declares that
Hilton has no business relationship with the property, its employees, or the
state of California. (Id.) 
In
opposition, Plaintiff does not offer any evidence to demonstrate this Court has
jurisdiction over Hilton. As Plaintiff does not offer any evidence to support
the Court’s exercise of jurisdiction, and the Defendant has offered evidence that
it is not subject to specific jurisdiction, the Court finds that it cannot
exercise specific jurisdiction over Defendant Hilton. 
In
sum, Hilton is not subject to general or specific personal jurisdiction in
California. 
IV.     CONCLUSION
AND ORDER
            Specially appearing
entity Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. motion to quash service of summons is
GRANTED. Counsel for Hilton is ordered to provide notice of this ruling.
