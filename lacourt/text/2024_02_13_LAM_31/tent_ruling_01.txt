I.          INTRODUCTION
 
            This is a
quiet title action concerning the real property at 8940 Kramerwood Place, Los
Angeles, California 90034.  Before the
court are various discovery motions and a motion to continue trial filed by
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”), and motion
to compel further discovery responses filed by Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Sannette Gite (“Gite”).  On March 18, 2022, the court issued an order
deeming this case related to Case No. 22STCV01686.  The actions were consolidated on February 8,
2024.
 
On January 12, 2024, the court granted Plaintiff’s ex parte
application and specially set the hearing for Plaintiff’s discovery motions and
motion to continue trial for February 13, 2024. 
The court also specially set the hearing for Defendant’s motion to
compel further for the same date.  The
court addresses each motion in turn.
 
II.        PLAINTIFF’S
DISCOVERY MOTIONS
 
a.     
Background
      
On October 24, 2023, U.S. Bank served Gite with Set One of
Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, Request for Production of
Documents, and Requests for Admissions.  Defense counsel twice requested, and Plaintiff
granted, extensions of time to respond the discovery.  However, to date, Defendant has not served
any responses.
 
            On January
9, 2024, Plaintiff filed these motions to compel answers to the interrogatories
and productions requests, and to deem admitted the admissions request.  Plaintiff requests sanctions against
Defendant.
 
            Defendant
filed oppositions.  Plaintiff filed an
omnibus reply.
 
b.     
Legal
Standard
             
If a party to whom interrogatories and inspection demands
are directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move
for an order to compel responses without objections.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§
2030.290, subd. (b), 2031.300, subd. (b).) 
A party moving to compel discovery responses under these statutory provisions
is not required to meet and confer prior to filing the motion.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b),
2031.300, subd. (b); see also Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific
Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411 (Sinaiko) (citing
Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 906 for the
proposition that “meet and confer” requirement “did not apply when propounding
party sought order compelling responses to interrogatories and sanctions for
responding party's failure to respond ‘within the statutorily permitted time’”).)  
 
If a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails
to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order that
the truth of the matters specified in the requests be deemed admitted. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)¿ Failure to timely serve responses waives
objections to the requests.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300,
subd. (a), 2033.280, subd. (a).)¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿ 
Monetary Sanctions¿¿¿ 
¿ 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general
statute authorizing the Court to impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the
discovery process,” which includes (without limitation) a variety of conduct
such as: making, without substantial justification, an unmeritorious objection
to discovery; making an evasive response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and
without substantial justification making or opposing a motion to compel or
limit discovery.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010.)¿¿¿¿ 
¿ 
If sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.040 requires that the notice specify the identity of the person against
whom sanctions are sought and the type of sanction requested, that the motion
be supported in the points and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a
declaration supporting the amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿¿ 
¿ 
If the court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made or
opposed a motion to compel responses to interrogatories or inspection demands,
the court “shall impose a monetary sanction . . . unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,
§§ 2030.290, subd. (c), 2031.310, subd. (h).)¿¿¿¿ In the context of a motion to
deem requests for admission admitted, it is mandatory that the court impose
monetary sanctions on the party or attorney, or both, whose failure to serve a
timely response to the request necessitated the motion.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).) 
 
c.      
Application
 
It is undisputed U.S. Bank properly served the at-issue
discovery and Gite failed to provide any responses.  Instead, Gite argues the motions should be
denied because U.S. Bank failed to meet and confer prior to filing these
motions and did not notify Gite that responses were due.  These arguments lack merit. 
 
First, a moving party is not required to meet and confer
prior to filing a motion to compel responses where no responses are provided at
all.  (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290,
2031.300, 2033.280; see also Sinaiko, supra, 148 Cal.App.4th at
p. 411 (citing Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 906
for the proposition that “meet and confer” requirement “did not apply when
propounding party sought order compelling responses to interrogatories and
sanctions for responding party's failure to respond ‘within the statutorily
permitted time’”).)
 
Second, Gite unreasonably argues U.S. Bank did not notify her
that responses were due.  Gite twice
requested extensions of time.  U.S. Bank
granted those requests.  (See Dias
Decls., Exs. B and C.)  Gite is hard
pressed to argue she was unaware of her discovery deadlines given that she
asked for more time.   
 
Given the foregoing, Gite has waived all objections to the
discovery requests.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2031.300, subd.
(a), 2033.280, subd. (a).)¿¿Moreover, U.S. Bank is entitled to an order deeming
the Request for Admissions, Set One, admitted against Gite.[1]

 
Monetary Sanctions
 
As it is undisputed Gite has not served timely responses to
properly served discovery and further, has opposed these motions without any justification,
sanctions are warranted.  Indeed, in the
context of requests for admissions, sanctions are mandatory.¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (c).)¿ Accordingly, sanctions are imposed against Gite in the
amount of $1,840, consisting of four hours at plaintiff’s counsel hourly rate
and $240 in filing fees. 
 
d.  Conclusion 
 
            The motions
are GRANTED.  Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Sannette Gite is ordered to provide verified, objection-free responses to
Plaintiff U.S. Bank’s First Set of Form Interrogatories, Special
Interrogatories, and Request for Production of Documents.  U.S. Bank’s Requests for Admissions, Set One,
are deemed admitted against Gite.  
 
The request for sanctions is GRANTED.  Gite is ordered to pay sanctions in the sum
of $1,840, to Plaintiff by and through its counsel.
 
Discovery responses are to be provided and sanctions are to
be paid within 30 days of this order. 
 
Moving party to give notice.
 
III.      PLAINTIFF’S
MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL
 
a.     
Procedural Background

 
On January 4, 2023, Plaintiff, U.S. Bank, filed this motion
to continue the trial date and all related cut-off dates for at least 180 days.  This is the second request for a trial
continuance.
 
On January 31, 2023, Gite filed an opposition.
 
On February 5, 2024, U.S. Bank replied.
 
Trial is scheduled for April 8, 2024.
 
b.     
Legal
Standard
 
California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(b) outlines that “a
party seeking a continuance of the date set for trial, whether contested or
uncontested or stipulated to by the parties, must make the request for a
continuance by a noticed motion or an ex parte application under the rules in
chapter 4 of this division, with supporting declarations.¿ The party must make
the motion or application as soon as reasonably practical once the necessity
for the continuance is discovered.”¿ 
 
Under California Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(c), the court
may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of good cause requiring
the continuance.  Circumstances that may indicate good cause include “a
party’s excused inability to obtain essential testimony, documents, or other
material evidence despite diligent efforts.”¿ The court should consider all
facts and circumstances relevant to the determination, such as proximity of the
trial date, prior continuances, prejudice suffered, whether all parties have
stipulated to a continuance, and whether the interests of justice are served.¿
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1332(d).)¿ 
 
c.      
Application
 
U.S. Bank argues good cause exists to continue the trial
date and all related cut-off dates for two reasons: (1) U.S. Bank recently
added new defendants to this action.  In
particular, U.S Bank only recently discovered that Randy Harden (a previously
unknown party) now claims title to the subject property subject to a grant deed
filed on August 31, 2023; and (2) Gite has not provided any responses to
properly propounded discovery which has prompted the filing of motions to
compel her answers (see Section II, supra, of this order).  As such, more time is needed to allow newly
named defendants to be served and appear in this action and to resolve
discovery disputes.  
 
Gite opposes a trial continuance exceeding 90 days.  She argues such a continuance will interfere
with her ability to save her home from foreclosure, which will cause her
irreparable harm and emotional distress. 
Specifically, Gite represents she cannot finalize a loan to cure a
default on a loan she took out on the subject property until this litigation is
completed.  
 
In reply, U.S. Bank notes that this court issued a temporary
restraining order on January 18, 2024 which stays any foreclosure proceeding on
the subject property until a hearing on U.S. Bank’s Application for a
Preliminary Injunction can be heard on April 8, 2024.  In other words, Gite is currently not at risk
of losing the subject property.  The court
will discuss with counsel the prospect of keeping the TRO in place and continuing
the hearing on the preliminary injunction until the trial date.   
 
Based on the foregoing, the court finds good cause exists to
continue the trial date.  New defendants
to this action have only recently appeared or have yet to appear.  Discovery remains outstanding.  The court also notes that this matter was
only recently consolidated with Case No. 22STCV01686.  There are numerous parties.  
 
d.  Conclusion
 
The motion is GRANTED. The Final Status Conference scheduled
for March 22, 2024 is CONTINUED to October 15, 2024 at 10:00 AM.¿ The Non-Jury
Trial scheduled for April 8, 2024 is CONTINUED to October 29, 2024 at 8:30 AM.¿
All discovery cut-off dates, all pretrial deadlines including discovery,
expert, and motion cut-off dates are continued to the new trial date of October
29, 2024.      
 
IV.       GITE’S MOTION
TO COMPEL FURTHER DISCOVERY RESPONSES 
 
On June 14, 2023, Gite served Cross-Defendant Velocity
Commercial Capital, LLC (“Velocity”), with Special Interrogatories, Set One.  On July 18, 2023, pursuant to an agreement
extending time to respond, Velocity served responses to the special
interrogatories.  Gite took issue with
Velocity’s responses.  Meet and confer
efforts did not resolve the discovery dispute.
 
On November 13, 2023, Gite filed this motion to compel
Velocity’s further responses to Special Interrogatory Nos. 8, 14-30, 34, and 35.  Gite seeks sanctions against Velocity and its
counsel of record.
 
The parties have not participated in an Informal Discovery
Conference (IDC) prior to the hearing of this motion.  Accordingly, the
court will continue the hearing for Gite’s motion to March 28, 2024 at 8:30
a.m. to allow the parties to participate in an IDC.  The parties are to
review the information for conducting IDCs in Dept. 31 located on the LA
Superior Court website for Dept. 31.  Thereafter the parties are to
contact the judicial assistant to schedule an IDC date and time.
