[1] Gite represents her discovery
responses will be served by February 1, 2024. 
In its Reply, filed February 2, 2024, U.S. Bank indicates Gite has not
yet served her responses.  If Gite shows
proof of service of her verified discovery responses, these motions will be
denied as moot except as to the issue of sanctions.  Absent further information showing otherwise,
sanctions will be imposed against Gite regardless of her service of her overdue
responses.
