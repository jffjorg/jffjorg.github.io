[1] Although the caption of the FAC
identifies seven causes of action, the body of the FAC sets forth only the five
causes of action.  Plaintiff may have
tried to sweep the Sixth and Seventh captioned causes of action into the Fifth Cause
of Action and by doing so made the Fifth Cause of action uncertain.  Nonetheless, the Sixth and Seventh Causes of
Action are not pleaded.  


[2] On January 12, 2024, Plaintiff
filed an Exhibit Errata.  Plaintiff
states Exhibit A to the FAC was omitted due to inadvertence.  Defendants’ demurrer indicates they received
the FAC with the attached exhibit.

The full quotation from the California
Supreme Court case is: “In an action based on a written
contract, a plaintiff may plead the legal effect of the contract rather than
its precise language.” (Construction
Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198–199.) 
 


[4] See, e.g., Sawyer v. Bank of
America (1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 135, 141 (holding that damages for insomnia
and emotional distress “are not to be awarded on a cause of action for breach
of contract.”).


[5] See, e.g., Gourley v State Farm
Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 53 Cal.3d 121, 127-28 (noting insureds have been
allowed to recover in tort for emotional distress damages flowing from an
insurer’s breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing).)


[6] On the face page of the FAC,
Plaintiff captions this cause
of action as “Violation of Unfair Insurance Practices Act and Insurance Code
785, 790.”  In the body of the FAC, however,
Plaintiff identifies the cause of action as “Breach of Implied Covenant of Good
Faith and Fair Dealing: violation of Unfair Business Practices Act, Ins. Code
785 and 790.”  To state a cause of action
for a breach of a written contract and its implied covenant of good faith and
fair dealing Plaintiff must proceed based upon a written contract.  As stated previously, the written contract
was entered into with Interinsurance, not Auto Club.  The court will address the second cause of
action as if it were based upon alleged violations of Ins. Code sections 785
and 790.

 With respect to trespass, the elements of
trespass are: (1) the plaintiff's ownership or control of the property; (2) the
defendant's intentional, reckless, or negligent entry onto the property; (3)
lack of permission for the entry or acts in excess of permission; (4) harm; and
(5) the defendant's conduct was a substantial factor in causing the harm. (See
CACI No. 2000.)”  (Ralphs Grocery Co.
v. Victory Consultants, Inc. (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 245, 262.)  A claim for invasion of privacy based upon a
common law tort of intrusion has two elements.  First, the defendant must intentionally
intrude into a place, conversation, or matter as to which the plaintiff has a
reasonable expectation of privacy. Second, the intrusion must occur in a manner
highly offensive to a reasonable person. 
(Hernandez v. Hillsides, Inc. (2009) 47 Cal.4th 272, 286.)  
 


[8] Given that the court has sustained
the Demurrer, the court need not address the motion to strike.  The court notes, however, that punitive
damages cannot be recovered for breach of contract.  “Punitive damages may not be awarded as
relief in a breach of contract claim.” (Ginsberg v. Gamson (2012) 205
Cal.App.4th 873, 896, citing Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a).)
