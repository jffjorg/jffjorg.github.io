MOTION
FOR RECONSIDERATION



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Dylan Scott Perry 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant
California Physicians’ Service d/b/a Blue Shield of California
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On June 22,
2023, Plaintiff, Dylan Scott Perry, filed this action against Defendant, California
Physicians’ Service d/b/a Blue Shield of California, alleging that Defendant
intentionally cancelled Plaintiff’s health insurance policy.  As a result,
Plaintiff suffered emotional and physical distress, as well as monetary
damages.  The operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) was filed on July
13, 2023.  Plaintiff is self-represented.  
 
            On September
8, 2023, Defendant filed a demurrer to the FAC.  
 
            On January
4, 2024, the court sustained Defendant’s demurrer without leave to amend.  On the same day, the court signed an Order of
Dismissal of Plaintiff’s action with prejudice.
 
            On January
8, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for reconsideration.
 
            Defendant
filed an opposition.  Plaintiff replied.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD 
“When an application for an order
has been made to a judge, or to a court, and refused in whole or in part, or
granted, or granted conditionally, or on terms, any party affected by the order
may, within 10 days after service upon the party of written notice of entry of
the order and based upon new or different facts, circumstances, or law, make
application to the same judge or court that made the order, to reconsider the
matter and modify, amend, or revoke the prior order.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1008,
subd. (a).)¿ “A party seeking reconsideration also must provide a satisfactory
explanation for the failure to produce the evidence at an earlier time.
[Citation.]”¿ (New York Times Co. v. Superior Court (2005) 135
Cal.App.4th 206, 212.)¿¿A motion for reconsideration is properly denied where
it is based on evidence that could have been presented in connection with the
original motion.¿ (Morris v. AGFA Corp. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th
1452, 1460.)¿¿¿ 
¿ “The statutory provisions
relating to motions for renewal (i.e., subsequent applications for the same
order) are found in section 1008, subdivision (b).”¿ (Graham v. Hansen (1982)
128 Cal.App.3d 965, 970.)¿ “A party who originally made an application for an
order which was refused in whole or part, or granted conditionally or on terms,
may make a subsequent application for the same order upon new or different
facts, circumstances, or law, in which case it shall be shown by affidavit what
application was made before, when and to what judge, what order or decisions
were made, and what new or different facts, circumstances, or law are claimed
to be shown.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc. § 1008, subd. (b).)¿ “These provisions contain
no requirement that a motion for renewal be made within the 10-day time period
as is required for motions for reconsideration.”¿ (Graham, 128
Cal.App.3d at p. 970.)¿ 
III.      DISCUSSION
 
            Plaintiff moves for reconsideration,
presumably, of the court’s January 4, 2024 order sustaining Defendant’s
demurrer without leave to amend.  
 
            The court does not have jurisdiction
to rule on this motion.  “A court may
reconsider its order granting or denying a motion and may even reconsider or
alter its judgment so long as judgment has not yet been entered. Once judgment
has been entered, however, the court may not reconsider it and loses its
unrestricted power to change the judgment.”  (Passavanti v. Williams
(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 1602, 1606.)  Entry
of an order for dismissal satisfies the entry of judgment requirement.  (APRI Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1999)
76 Cal.App.4th 176, 181.)
 
            Here, an Order of
Dismissal was entered in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff on January 4,
2023.  Given the entry of judgment, the court lacks jurisdiction to
reconsider the order. 
 
V.          CONCLUSION
            
The motion is DENIED.
 
Defendant to give notice.
