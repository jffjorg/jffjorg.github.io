And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Kerry Bensinger in the case of Juanita Marquez v. Equinox Holdings Inc., case number 22STCV20090. The plaintiff, Juanita Marquez, is seeking to use a settled statement instead of a reporter's transcript of the trial court oral proceedings for the appeal filed on October 9, 2023. The motion is unopposed by the defendant.

The judge notes that the oral proceedings were not reported by a court reporter and cannot be transcribed. Therefore, the judge finds that the motion to use a settled statement is granted under California Rules of Court, rule 8.137(b)(2). The plaintiff must give notice of the ruling.
