The defendant, Jennifer O. Oh, has filed an unopposed motion to compel the plaintiff, Joanne Pak, to provide responses to her request for production of documents. The plaintiff has failed to respond to the discovery request, and all objections to the production demands are waived. The court grants the motion and orders the plaintiff to provide verified, objection-free responses to the request for production of documents. Additionally, the court grants the defendant's request for sanctions and orders the plaintiff to pay $548.91 in sanctions. The plaintiff is also ordered to provide the discovery responses and pay the sanctions within 30 days of the date of this order.
