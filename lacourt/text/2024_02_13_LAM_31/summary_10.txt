And here is the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by the defendants and the motion to strike filed by the plaintiff. The court finds that the plaintiff's FAC sets forth only five causes of action, and the sixth and seventh captioned causes of action are not pleaded. The court also notes that the plaintiff filed an Exhibit Errata on January 12, 2024, which states that Exhibit A to the FAC was omitted due to inadvertence.

The court rejects the plaintiff's claims for breach of contract and invasion of privacy, finding that the plaintiff failed to state a cause of action for breach of contract and that the invasion of privacy claim is not supported by the facts. The court also sustains the demurrer and does not address the motion to strike.

The court notes that punitive damages cannot be recovered for breach of contract, citing California Civil Code section 3294. The court also references several California court cases, including Construction Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co., Sawyer v. Bank of America, Gourley v State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., Hernandez v Hillsides, Inc., and Ginsberg v Gamson.
