And here is the English-text summary:

The judge, Kerry Bensinger, has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the court's order sustaining the defendant's demurrer without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Dylan Scott Perry, filed a motion for reconsideration after the court dismissed his action with prejudice on January 4, 2024. The defendant, California Physicians' Service d/b/a Blue Shield of California, opposed the motion. The court finds that it lacks jurisdiction to reconsider the order because an Order of Dismissal was entered in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff on January 4, 2024, which satisfies the entry of judgment requirement. The court cites various laws and case citations to support its decision.
