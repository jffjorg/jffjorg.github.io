The court grants the motion to strike the Malicious Prosecution and Unfair Debt Collection Practices claims brought by Robert W. Steele against Bankers Healthcare Group, LLC. The court finds that BHG's litigation of the Underlying Action was protected activity under the Anti-SLAPP statute and that Steele failed to meet his burden to show that he has a reasonable probability of prevailing on his claims. The court also finds that the Rosenthal Act claim is time-barred. As a result, the court strikes the Malicious Prosecution and Unfair Debt Collection Practices claims from the complaint. Additionally, the court awards BHG $13,692.50 in attorneys' fees and costs.
