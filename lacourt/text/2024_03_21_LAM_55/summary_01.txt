And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions: one filed by Defendant Angel Garcia to set aside the default and related orders, and another filed by Defendant Roof Supply G&F San Diego to set aside the default and related orders.

The judge finds that Defendant Garcia's default was entered in error, as the court accepted his answer even though default had been entered. Defendant Garcia's counsel was unaware of the default and continued to file documents on his behalf. The judge concludes that a mistake occurred and grants Defendant Garcia's motion to set aside the default.

The judge also grants Defendant Roof Supply's motion to set aside the default, finding that the company demonstrated surprise and/or excusable neglect for failing to obtain counsel and appear at a hearing. The judge notes that Plaintiffs did not give Defendant Roof Supply notice of the hearing, and that the parties had been actively engaged in settlement discussions throughout 2023. The judge concludes that relieving Defendant Roof Supply from default would not prejudice Plaintiffs and grants the motion.

Both motions are granted, and the judge vacates and sets aside the defaults entered against Defendant Garcia and Defendant Roof Supply.
