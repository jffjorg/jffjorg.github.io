And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has decided to continue the motion to compel further responses to a date agreed upon by the parties. The Judge reminds Counsel for Plaintiff that she needs to familiarize herself with Department 55's Courtroom Information page, which explains the importance of participating in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC) before filing a motion to compel. The Judge notes that the parties did not exhaust their meet and confer efforts, only exchanging one set of meet and confer letters, and did not schedule an IDC. The Judge expects the parties to schedule an IDC and follow the Court's rules in preparing for it. The Judge also expects the parties to reach an agreement on their disputes without Court intervention, given their experience and expertise in Lemon Law cases.
