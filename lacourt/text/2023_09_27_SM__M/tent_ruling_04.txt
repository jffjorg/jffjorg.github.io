Judgment Recovery Inc.  v. Leah Agus, et
al.
CASE NO.:                23SMCP00218
MOTION:                  Motion
to Vacate Judgment
HEARING DATE:   9/27/2023

 
BACKGROUND
 
This is a sister state judgment action arising from a
judgment issued in the Western District of North Carolina against Defendant
Agus. The underlying case regards the nationally reported “ZeekRewards” Ponzi
scheme. Agus is a “Net Winner Class Member.” The judgment against her comprises
the net winnings from the scheme that were fraudulently transferred to her.
Plaintiff is the assignee of the judgment in the underlying action.
 
On April 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed an application for
entry of judgment on the sister state judgment. The Clerk granted the
application and issued the judgment.
 
Legal
Standard
 
To enforce a
foreign “sister state” judgment in California, the judgment creditor must register
the judgment as a California judgment in accordance with the Sister State
Money-Judgments Act or by bringing an action to establish the judgment in
California. (CCP § 1913; Conseco Marketing, LLC v. IFA & Ins. Services,
Inc. (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 831, 838.) SSMJA provides expeditious and
economical registration procedure for enforcing sister state money judgments. (Id.)
The sister state judgment may be filed with a California court, and a judgment may
immediately entered thereon subject generally to a 30-day stay after service of
notice of entry on the judgment debtor. (Id., see CCP § 1710.45(d).) 
 
A sister state judgment may be vacated on any ground
which would be a defense to an action in California on the sister state
judgment. (CCP § 1710.40(a).) This motion must be made within 30 days after
service of notice of entry of judgment pursuant to Section 1710.30. (Id.)
 
Analysis
 
Defendant Agus does not substantiate
any grounds for vacating this judgment. She claims that she did not receive
notice of this judgment until the notice of entry of judgment in this sister
state action. However, Defendant does not provide a declaration verifying these
facts. (See Agus Decl., ¶¶ 1-2.) Further, Defendant does not provide proof of
service on the judgment creditor.
 
Accordingly, the motion will be
continued to allow for service of the motion and the submission of additional
evidence.
 
In addition, the Court will set an OSC re Vacating
Judgment.  The judgment in this
matter was entered pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1710.25, which
allows for entry of judgment of “sister state judgments.” A “sister state
judgment” is defined as any judgment, decree, or order of a court of a state
of the United States, other than California. (CCP §1710.10(c), emphasis
added.) The comment to subdivision states:
 
Subdivision (c)
is based on Section 1 of the revised Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments
Act of 1964. 9A Uniform Laws Ann. 488 (1965). However, unlike the Uniform
Act which applies to all state and federal judgments entitled to full faith and
credit, Section 1710.10(c) applies only to judgments of sister state courts
which require the payment of money…
 
Furthermore, secondary sources
note that “[i]nstead [of the SSMJA], nearly all federal court judgments are
enforceable by registration in a California federal district[.]” (Cal. Prac.
Guide Enf. J. & Debt Ch. 6J-2:1802.1; see also Richard A. Viguerire Co.
v. Noble (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 62, 64 [concluding that the District of
Columbia is a “sister state” for the purposes of CCP § 1710.10].) A final
judgment for the recovery of money or property entered outside California in
any federal district court may be enforced in California by registering it in a
federal district in California. (28 USC § 1963.)
 
Here, the underlying judgment was
made in the United States District Court, Western District of North Carolina.
This is not a sister state judgment that may be registered in California state
court pursuant to section 1710.25.  Plaintiff
may address this issue at the continued hearing.
