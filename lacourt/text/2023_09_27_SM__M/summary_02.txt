Roles:
  - Judge: Tentative Ruling
  - Plaintiff: Beroukhim, et al.
  - Defendant: Beroukhim

Significant Statements:
  - The court must consider the sufficiency of the allegations, including any parol evidence allegations, to determine whether the contract is reasonably susceptible to the plaintiff's alleged interpretation.
  - A pleader's legal characterization of a contract is not controlling, particularly when the contract is attached to the pleading.
  - Courts will defer to plaintiffs' reasonable interpretations.
  - A special demurrer for uncertainty is disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that the defendant cannot reasonably respond.
  - A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.
```

Summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by Defendant Beroukhim with leave to amend. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) does not plead any conduct by Defendant that could be considered a breach of the Note. The FAC is susceptible to a special demurrer under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10(g) as it does not clearly establish that the contract is written, oral, or implied by conduct. The Court also sustains the demurrer to the Second Cause of Action for Declaratory Relief, finding that the FAC does not plead an actual controversy and the requested declaratory relief would be adverse to the Plaintiff.

  - The court will defer to plaintiffs' reasonable interpretations.
  - The Note fails to expressly incorporate any term so the Benouni Loan, or independently provide any of the payment conditions cited by Plaintiff.
  - The FAC's allegations make it clear that this Note was one part of a larger agreement between the parties concerning the financing of the Property.
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained the defendant's demurrer to the first amended complaint (FAC) with leave to amend. The plaintiff has not alleged any conduct by the defendant that could be considered a breach of the note. The FAC does not clearly establish that the contract is written, oral, or implied by conduct. The plaintiff needs to clarify its theory and plead the full terms of the agreement.

The judge also sustained the defendant's demurrer to the declaratory relief cause of action, which seeks to determine whether the defendant breached the note. The FAC alleges an actual controversy has arisen under the note, but the plaintiff would only be entitled to a declaration that the defendant has not breached the note.
