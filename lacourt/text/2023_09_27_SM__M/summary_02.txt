Roles:
  - Judge: Tentative Ruling
  - Plaintiff: Beroukhim, et al.
  - Defendant: Beroukhim

Significant Statements:
  - The court must consider the sufficiency of the allegations, including any parol evidence allegations, to determine whether the contract is reasonably susceptible to the plaintiff's alleged interpretation.
  - A pleader's legal characterization of a contract is not controlling, particularly when the contract is attached to the pleading.
  - Courts will defer to plaintiffs' reasonable interpretations.
  - A special demurrer for uncertainty is disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that the defendant cannot reasonably respond.
  - A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.
```

Summary:
The Judge's tentative ruling sustains the demurrer filed by Defendant Beroukhim with leave to amend. The Court finds that the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (FAC) does not plead any conduct by Defendant that could be considered a breach of the Note. The FAC is susceptible to a special demurrer under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10(g) as it does not clearly establish that the contract is written, oral, or implied by conduct. The Court also sustains the demurrer to the Second Cause of Action for Declaratory Relief, finding that the FAC does not plead an actual controversy and the requested declaratory relief would be adverse to the Plaintiff.
