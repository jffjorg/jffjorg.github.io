And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of GSI Exchange v. Mark Cowper, regarding a motion to compel compliance with a demand for certain documents. The plaintiff, GSI Exchange, had agreed to produce the documents in response to a request for production, but failed to do so. The defendant, Mark Cowper, moved for an order compelling compliance, and the plaintiff claims that the motion is moot since it has now produced the documents. The judge agrees that the motion is moot, but notes that the plaintiff failed to justify its belated production of the documents. The judge also denies the defendant's request for monetary sanctions, citing a due process error in the way the request was made.
