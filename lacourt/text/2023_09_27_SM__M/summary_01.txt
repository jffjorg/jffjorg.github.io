**English Summary:**

Judge's Tentative Ruling:

The Defendant, Mark Cowper, moved to compel Plaintiff, GSI Exchange, to produce documents they agreed to produce in April 2023. Plaintiff argues the motion is moot because they provided the documents on August 27, 2023. The Judge agrees that the motion is moot.

However, the Judge finds Plaintiff's explanation for the delayed production insufficient and notes that monetary sanctions are mandatory unless justified or acted with substantial justification. 

Although Defendant requested sanctions of $787.50, the Judge did not grant them due to procedural errors in how the sanctions request was made. The Judge believes Plaintiff should have produced the documents on time and finds their explanation lacking.
