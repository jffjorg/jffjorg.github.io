And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a sister state judgment action arising from a judgment issued in the Western District of North Carolina against Defendant Agus. The underlying case regards the ZeekRewards Ponzi scheme, and Agus is a "Net Winner Class Member." The judgment against her comprises the net winnings from the scheme that were fraudulently transferred to her. The plaintiff, Nationwide Judgment Recovery Inc., is the assignee of the judgment in the underlying action.

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to vacate the judgment, as she has not substantiated any grounds for vacating the judgment. The defendant claims she did not receive notice of the judgment, but she does not provide a declaration verifying these facts or proof of service on the judgment creditor.

The judge has continued the motion to allow for service of the motion and the submission of additional evidence. The court will also set an OSC re Vacating Judgment. The judge notes that the underlying judgment is not a sister state judgment that may be registered in California state court, but rather a federal district court judgment that may be enforced in California by registering it in a federal district court.
