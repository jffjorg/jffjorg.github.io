And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a sister state judgment action arising from a judgment issued in the Western District of North Carolina against Defendant Agus. The underlying case regards the ZeekRewards Ponzi scheme, and Agus is a "Net Winner Class Member." The judgment against her comprises the net winnings from the scheme that were fraudulently transferred to her. The plaintiff, Nationwide Judgment Recovery Inc., is the assignee of the judgment in the underlying action.

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to vacate the judgment, as she has not substantiated any grounds for vacating the judgment. The defendant claims she did not receive notice of the judgment, but she does not provide a declaration verifying these facts or proof of service on the judgment creditor.

The judge has continued the motion to allow for service of the motion and the submission of additional evidence. The court will also set an OSC re Vacating Judgment. The judge notes that the underlying judgment is not a sister state judgment that may be registered in California state court, but rather a federal district court judgment that may be enforced in California by registering it in a federal district court.

**English Summary:**

This tentative ruling deals with a motion to vacate a judgment against Leah Agus in a case involving the "ZeekRewards" Ponzi scheme. Nationwide Judgment Recovery Inc. is seeking to enforce a judgment originally issued in a North Carolina federal court against Agus. 

The judge notes that Agus claims she did not receive notice of the judgment until recently. However, she has not provided sufficient evidence to support this claim. The judge therefore continues the motion to allow Agus to serve the motion and submit further evidence.

The judge also raises concerns about whether the judgment from the North Carolina federal court qualifies as a "sister state judgment" eligible for registration in California under the specific California statute governing such judgments.  The judge indicates this issue needs to be addressed further by the plaintiff.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to vacate a sister state judgment issued in the Western District of North Carolina against Leah Agus. The judgment was entered in California based on the Sister State Money-Judgments Act (CCP § 1913). The underlying case regards the ZeekRewards Ponzi scheme, and Agus is a "Net Winner Class Member" who received net winnings from the scheme. Agus claims she did not receive notice of the judgment until the notice of entry of judgment in this sister state action, but does not provide a declaration verifying these facts or proof of service on the judgment creditor.

The judge finds that Agus does not substantiate any grounds for vacating the judgment and will continue the motion to allow for service of the motion and the submission of additional evidence. The judge will also set an order to show cause re Vacating Judgment. The judge notes that the underlying judgment was made in a federal district court and may be enforced in California by registering it in a federal district court, rather than registering it in a California state court. The judge will allow the parties to address this issue at the continued hearing.
