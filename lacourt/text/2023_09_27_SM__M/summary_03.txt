And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers filed by Lebowsky, the defendant, to the four causes of action in the complaint. The causes of action are: breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, contract interference, and elder abuse. The judge has sustained the demurrers with leave to amend as to the first, second, third, and fourth causes of action, except the sixth cause of action, which is for declaratory relief. The judge has overruled the demurrer as to the sixth cause of action.

The judge has found that the complaint fails to adequately plead the elements of breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and contract interference. The complaint also fails to specify how Lebowsky's conduct caused the disputed funds to be retained. The judge has given the plaintiff leave to amend the complaint to address these deficiencies.

The judge has also found that the complaint fails to adequately plead the elements of elder abuse, and that further facts are required to establish that Lebowsky took or assisted in taking the disputed sum.

The only cause of action that was not sustained was the sixth cause of action for declaratory relief, which was overruled. The judge has found that the complaint adequately pleads an actual controversy over the proper subject of declaratory relief, and that the court should not sustain a general demurrer on the theory that any declaration would necessarily be adverse to the plaintiff.

The judge has ordered the plaintiff to file an amended complaint within 10 days. The motion to strike is also moot, as the court has granted leave to amend.
