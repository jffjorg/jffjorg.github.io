And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled on the motion to quash service of summons filed by Lidgerwood Mundy Corporation, arguing that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The corporation claims that it did not have sufficient contacts with California to justify the court's exercise of jurisdiction. The judge has denied the motion, finding that the corporation's sales of pumps to a Navy contractor in California from 1978 to 1986 constitute sufficient contacts with the state. However, the judge has also granted the corporation's request for discovery to determine whether it knew the destination of the pumps it was selling and whether the ships on which the plaintiff served that were built in California contained the corporation's pumps. The hearing on the motion has been continued to January 18, 2024, and the parties are allowed to file supplemental briefs.
