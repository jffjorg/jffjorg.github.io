And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award filed by Petitioner Arden Silverman dba Capital Asset Protection is denied. The Court finds that the Petition is not timely filed, as the award was served more than 10 days prior to the filing of the Petition. Additionally, the Court notes that the Petitioner failed to provide sufficient proof of service of the arbitration award. The Court also finds that Respondent's response to the Petition is untimely and fails to provide proper grounds for challenging the award. Therefore, the Petition is denied.
