ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard 
“A party who
claims that there is a written agreement to arbitrate may petition the superior
court for an order to compel arbitration” pursuant to California Code of Civil
Procedure section 1281.2. (Banner Entertainment, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 348, 356.) “California law, like federal law, favors
enforcement of valid arbitration agreements.” (Armendariz v. Foundation
Health Psychcare Services, Inc. (2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 97.) “On petition of
a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written
agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party to the agreement refuses
to arbitrate that controversy, the court shall order the petitioner and the
respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to
arbitrate the controversy exists, unless it determines that: (a) The right to
compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner; or (b) Grounds exist for
rescission of the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.2.) A party opposing a
petition to compel arbitration “bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence any fact necessary to its defense.” (Banner Entertainment,
Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 62 Cal.App.4th 348, 356.) 
 
“[T]he writing
memorializing an arbitration agreement need not be signed by both parties in
order to be upheld as a binding arbitration agreement.” Serafin v. Balco
Properties Ltd., LLC (2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 165, 176. “[I]t is not the presence
or absence of a signature which is dispositive; it is the presence or absence
of evidence of an agreement to arbitrate which matters.” (Banner
Entertainment, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 62 Cal.App.4th 348, 361.) 
 
Where a motion to
compel arbitration is granted, a court “shall, upon motion of a party to such
action or proceeding, stay the action or proceeding until an arbitration is had
in accordance with the order to arbitrate or until such earlier time as the
court specifies.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.4.) 
   
II.        Discussion 
Defendant Sol
Acceptance brings the instant Motion seeking to compel Plaintiff to submit to
arbitration based on a vehicle Retail Installment Sale Contract (the “RISC”) pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure § 1281.2. 
Here, Sol
Acceptance provides evidence of the existence of the arbitration agreement in
RISC, which was entered into with Plaintiff. (Motion, Chris Tauscher Decl. ¶ 2,
Exh. 1, p. 7 at “Arbitration Provision”.) The arbitration agreement states
that, 
Any claim or dispute, whether in contract, tort, statute or
otherwise (including the Interpretation and scope of this Arbitration
Provision, and the arbitrability of the claim or dispute), between you and us
or our employees, agents, successors or assigns, which arises out of or relates
to your credit application, purchase or condition of this vehicle, this
contract or any resulting transaction or relationship (including any such
relationship with third parties who do not sign this contract) shall, at your or
our election, be resolved by neutral, binding arbitration and not by a court
action. 
(Id.) Thus based on the foregoing,
the Court finds the existence of an enforceable arbitration agreement between
the parties. 
            Here,
Sol Acceptance provides evidence that the parties have been unable to come to an
agreement regarding arbitration. (Motion, Paige C. Sirey Decl. ¶ 3, Exh.
2.) The
Court notes that Plaintiff does not assert any defense to enforcement of the
arbitration agreement, such as waiver or other grounds to revoke the agreement. The court
further notes that “California
law, ‘like [federal law], reflects a strong policy favoring arbitration
agreements and requires close judicial scrutiny of waiver claims.’”  (Wagner
Const. Co. v. Pacific Mechanical Corp. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 19, 31.) Therefore,
the Court finds that Sol Acceptance is entitled to an order compelling Plaintiff
to arbitration. 
The Court
further notes that Sol Acceptance has also demonstrated that the parties agreed
to arbitrate the dispute through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”).
The arbitration agreement states: “You may choose the American Arbitration
Association, 1633 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, New York 10019 (www.adr.org),
or any other organization to conduct the arbitration subject to our approval.”
(Motion, Tauscher Decl., Exh. 1, p. 7 at “Arbitration Provision.”) Plaintiff has
not indicated she does not approve of the AAA, nor has she submitted any other
organization to conduct the arbitration. Thus, the Court finds the issue can be
sufficiently arbitrated before the AAA. 
The Court additionally
finds that a stay of the action is also appropriate in this case once the
Motion is granted as Code of Civil Procedure § 1281.4 stipulates that the court
shall stay the action until arbitration is completed.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
1281.4.) 
     
Finally, Sol Acceptance
requests costs incurred bringing the instant Motion in the amount of $444.95. Code
of Civil Procedure § 1293.2 provides that, “[t]he court shall award costs upon
any judicial proceeding under this title as provided in Chapter 6 (commencing
with Section 1021) of Title 14 of Part 2 of this code.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1293.2.) “A petition to compel arbitration under section 1281.2 is a judicial
proceeding covered by this provision.”  (Otay River Constructors v. San
Diego Expressway (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 796, 805.) Here, Sol Acceptance
avers that it has incurred costs in the sum of $444.95 for the following
$435.00 in appearance fees and $9.95 in electronic filing fees (Motion, Sirey
Decl. ¶ 8.) Therefore, the Court GRANTS Sol Acceptance’s request for cost. 
II.        Conclusion 
            
            Defendant Sol Acceptance’s Petition to Compel Arbitration and Stay
the Proceedings is GRANTED. DEFENDANT’S REQUEST FOR COSTS IS GRANTED IN
THE AMOUNT OF $444.95 FOR DEFENDANT SOL ACCEPTANCE AND AGAINST PLAINTIFF.
 
The matter is STAYED and is
to be arbitrated before the American Arbitration Association (AAA), as provided
by the Agreement.
