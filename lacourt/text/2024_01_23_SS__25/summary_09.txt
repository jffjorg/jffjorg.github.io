And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has granted Counsel Joan Lauricella's motion to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Salvador Minjares. The motion was filed on November 7, 2023, and no opposition or reply has been filed. The court finds that all procedural requirements have been satisfied and that there is no showing that withdrawal would cause injustice or undue delay in the proceedings. The judge notes that there has been a breakdown in communication between Counsel and the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff has failed to respond to Counsel's communications. The court orders that Counsel's relief as counsel of record for the plaintiff is not effective until proof of service of the order is filed in the action.
