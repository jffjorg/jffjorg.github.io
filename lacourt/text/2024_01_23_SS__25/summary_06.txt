And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The Court grants the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment against Defendant Villegas in the amount of $5,321.74. The Plaintiff filed an action against the defendants for subrogation stemming from an automobile collision. The parties entered into a settlement agreement, which provided for the payment of $4,935.14 by Defendant Villegas in installments. However, Defendant Villegas failed to make the payments as agreed, resulting in a breach of the settlement agreement. The Plaintiff sent a default letter to Defendant Villegas, but Defendant Villegas failed to cure the default. As a result, the Plaintiff is entitled to an entry of judgment against Defendant Villegas. The Court finds that the settlement agreement is valid and enforceable under CCP § 664.6, and grants the Plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal and enter judgment.
