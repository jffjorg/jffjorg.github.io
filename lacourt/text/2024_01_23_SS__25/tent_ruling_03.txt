BACKGROUND
 
On February 7, 2019, arbitrator
Yvonne B. Burke issued an Arbitration Award in favor of nonparty Strategic
Business Services, LLC (“SBS”) against Respondent Mahaffey Law Group, P.C.
(“Respondent” or “Mahaffey”) in the sum of $2,233, plus $400 in attorney’s fees
and all administrative fees of the arbitration. (Fourth. Am. Pet. p. 2.) On
March 25, 2019, SBS assigned its rights to the Arbitration Award to Petitioner
Arden Silverman dba Capital Asset Protection (“Silverman”). (Pet. p. 2 ¶ 5,
Attach. 5.) 
 
On April 2, 2019, Silverman, in
propria persona, as assignee of SBS (“Petitioner”) filed a Petition to Confirm
Arbitration Award (“Petition”) as to Respondent Mahaffey. Respondent filed a
Motion to Vacate Arbitration Award on May 2, 2019. 
 
On June 7, 2019, Petitioner filed a
Substitution of Attorney, indicating that he had retained counsel. Through his
Counsel, Petitioner filed an Amended Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award on
the same day. On June 27, 2019, Petitioner filed an Opposition to Respondent’s
Motion to Vacate Arbitration Award and a Request for Sanctions. On September
25, 2019, Respondent filed an Opposition to Petitioner’s Amended Petition.
Respondent also filed a Reply to Petitioner’s Opposition to Motion to Vacate,
on October 1, 2019. 
 
On October 8, 2019, the Court noted
that SBS was a party to the arbitration proceedings but neither Petitioner nor
Respondent named SBS as a party in their moving papers. (10-8-19 Minute Order.)
For this reason, the Court continued the hearing on the Amended Petition and
Motion to Vacate. (Ibid.) On December 5, 2019, the Court noted that no
additional papers had been filed and placed the Amended Petition and Motion to
Vacate off calendar. (12-5-19 Minute Order.) 
 
On December 13, 2019, Petitioner
filed a Second Amended Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award (“SAP”), naming
Mahaffey and SBS as Respondents. Respondent Mahaffey filed an Opposition and
Request to Vacate Award on December 16, 2019. On June 17, 2020, Petitioner
filed an Opposition to Respondent’s Request to Vacate Award. No hearings were
scheduled on the Petition. 
 
On December 9, 2022, Petitioner
filed a Notice of Related Case. On January 30, 2023, the Court found that
“19STCP01039 and 22STCP01747, are related within the meaning of California
Rules of Court, rule 3.300(a)” and designated 19STCP01039 as the lead case.
(1-30-23 Minute Order.) Both cases were assigned to Department 25 at the Spring
Street Courthouse. (Ibid.)
 
On January 31, 2023, Petitioner
filed a Motion Seeking an Order Restoring this Case to Active Status in
Department 25 and to Specially Set Date to Confirm Arbitration Award and Enter
Judgment. On April 19, 2023, the Court ruled that the Motion to Restore Case to
Active Status was moot because the case was still in active status. (4-19-23
Minute Order.) The Court also set a hearing for the SAP on May 22, 2023.
(4-19-23 Minute Order.) 
 
On May 22, 2023, the Court noted
that Petitioner had failed to file proof showing the exact date that the award
was served on Petitioner and Respondents. (5-22-23 Minute Order.) First,
Petitioner must file such proof to show that a neutral arbitrator served a copy
of the award on each party by “personally or by registered or certified mail or
as provided in the agreement” as required by Code of Civil Procedure § 1283.6. Second,
the Court must determine the exact date of service to assess whether the
opposition and request to vacate the award were filed timely. Accordingly, the
Court continued the hearing on the Petition and ordered Petitioner to file
supplemental papers showing the date and manner by which the neutral arbitrator
served the final award on the parties. Furthermore, the Court noted that
Petitioner did not file support for its request for attorney’s fees and costs
and permitted Petitioner to file supplemental papers in support of its request.
(Ibid.) 
 
On June 1, 2023, Petitioner filed
supplemental papers. On June 20, 2023, Respondent Mahaffey filed a Reply
Regarding Petitioner’s Filing and the Court’s Prior Ruling. On June 21, 2023,
Petitioner filed a Reply to the Opposition. On June 22, 2023, the Court, on its
own motion, continued the hearing on the Petition to July 5, 2023. On July 05,
2023, the Court denied the petition noting that Petitioner did not provide
sufficient proof that the neutral arbitrator properly served the final award. 
 
On October 18, 2023, Petitioner
filed the instant Fourth Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award. On December 11,
2023, the Court on its own motion continued the hearing to January 23, 2024.
Respondent files in opposition. Petitioner files in reply.
 
MOVING PARTY
POSITION
 
            Petitioner
seeks an order confirming the arbitration award entered by arbitrator Yvonne B.
Burke on February 7, 2019, against Respondent in the amount of $2,233.00, as
well as interest and attorney’s fees and costs.
 
 
OPPOSITION
 
            In
opposition, Respondent alleges that the Petition must be denied based on the
procedural defects and inaccuracies with the Petition, noting specifically that
Petitioner is a non-party to the action and as such cannot bring the motion. Mahaffey
argues that SBS was not a party to the contract, rather the contract was
between Mark Wald, dba SBS and Mahaffey. Mahaffey further argues that under CCP
§ 1288, the petition to confirm arbitration is time barred as more than four
years has passed since the award was originally issued against the parties. Moreover,
Respondent argues that the Arbitrator’s failure to properly serve the award by
personal service as required by law compels denial of the Petition. Finally,
Respondent argues that the Petition is barred under the doctrine of Res
Judicata as a similar case was previously decided in small claims court and
Petitioner alleges the same primary right as the previous suit. 
 
REPLY
 
            In reply,
Petitioner argues that respondent’s opposition to the Petition is not timely as
the opposition was not filed within 10 days from when Petitioner filed his
initial petition on April 09, 2019. Further, Petitioner argues that Respondent
does not establish proper statutory grounds to vacate the petition. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
I.          Legal
Standard 
“Any
party to an arbitration award in which an award has been made may petition the
court to confirm, correct, or vacate the award.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 1285.) “Regardless of the particular relief
granted, any arbitrator’s award is enforceable only when confirmed as a
judgment of the superior court.” (O’Hare v. Municipal Resource Consultants (2003)
107 Cal.App.4th 267, 278.) “Once a petition to
confirm an award is filed, the superior
court must select one of only four courses of action: it may confirm the award,
correct and confirm it, vacate it, or dismiss the petition.” (EHM Productions, Inc. v. Starline Tours of
Hollywood, Inc. (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.) “It is well
settled that the scope of judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely
narrow.” (California Faculty Assn.
v. Superior Court (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 935, 943.) “Neither the trial court, nor the appellate court, may
‘review the merits of the dispute, the sufficiency of the evidence, or the
arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we correct or review an award because of an
arbitrator’s legal or factual error, even if it appears on the award’s face.”
(EHM Productions, supra, at p.
1063-64.) 
 
II.        Discussion 
 
A.        Filing Requirements (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.4)
 
Code of Civil Procedure, section
1285.4 states: “A petition under
this chapter shall: 
 
(a) Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of
the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of the
agreement.
 
(b) Set forth the names of the arbitrators. 
 
(c) Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and
the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.” 
 
(Code Civ.
Proc. § 1285.4.) “A response to a petition under this chapter may request the
court to dismiss the petition or to confirm, correct or vacate the award.”
(Code Civ. Proc. § 1285.2.)
 
Here, Petitioner has satisfied the
requirements of CCP section 1285.4 by setting forth the substance of the
parties’ agreement to arbitrate within the Petition. (Pet. ¶ 4, Attachment 4(b).)

Petitioner sets forth the Arbitrator’s
name, Yvonne B. Burke., and attaches a copy of the Arbitrator’s award of $2,223.00
in Petitioner’s favor along with
a letter indicating the award is duly executed. (See Attachment 8(c).) The
Award stipulates that the Petitioner is to be awarded the amount totaling
$2,233.00 for services rendered pursuant to the contract between Strategic
Business Services LLC and Mahaffey Law Group, PC plus attorney fees of $400.00. (Id.) Thus, the Court finds
that Petitioner follows CCP section 1285.4.
B.        Service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing (Code Civ.
Proc. § 1290.4)
Code of
Civil Procedure, section 1290.4 states, in relevant part: 
 
“(a) A copy of the petition and a
written notice of the time and place of the hearing thereof and any other
papers upon which the petition is based
shall be served in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for the
service of such petition and notice.
 
(b) If the arbitration agreement does not
provide the manner in which such service shall be made and the person upon whom
service is to be made has not previously appeared in the proceeding and has not
previously been served in accordance with this subdivision:
 
(1) Service within this State shall be made in the
manner provided by law for the service of summons in an action. 
 
(2) Service outside this State shall be made by mailing
the copy of the petition and notice of hearing and other papers by registered
or certified mail. Personal service is the equivalent of such service by mail.
Proof of service by mail shall be made by affidavit showing such mailing
together with the return receipt of the United States Post Office bearing the
signature of the person on whom service was made…” 
 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
1290.4(a)&(b).)
 
Here, the Petition and notice
of hearing was served by substituted service on Respondents on October 17, 2023.
(Pet.) Thus, the Court finds
that Petitioner has satisfied CCP section 1290.4.
C.        Service
of the Arbitration Award & Timeliness of Petition (Code Civ. Proc. §§
1283.6, 1288, 1288.4)
Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6
provides that, “The neutral arbitrator
shall serve a signed copy of
the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by registered or
certified mail or as provided in the agreement.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1283.6.)  California Rules of Court rule
3.825(b)(1) provides that the arbitrator must file the award with the clerk,
with proof of service on each party to the arbitration. (CA ST CIVIL RULES Rule
3.825(b)(1)) The Superior Court of Los Angeles County, Local Rules, rule
3.301(a) so provides that consistent with CRC 3.825 arbitrator can satisfy this
by filing Form LAADR-014 with the award, and proof of service. (Super. Ct. L.A.
County, Local Rules, rule 3.301(a).) Additionally, a party may seek a court
judgment confirming an arbitration award by filing and serving a petition no
more than four years, but not less than
10 days, after the award is served on the
petitioner. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.)
The Court notes that the Petition is timely filed. Here, the
Award was issued on February 07, 2019. (See Attachment 9(b).) Petitioner provides the Court with the
declaration of Mark Wald who was a witness in the arbitration hearing. Wald
states that he received the arbitration award issued by the Arbitrator on February
07, 2019. (Wald Decl. ¶ 3, Exh. A.)  However,
the Court notes a critical deficiency with the Petition. Code of Civil
Procedure § 1283.6 requires that: “The neutral arbitrator shall serve
a signed copy of the award on each party to the arbitration personally
or by registered or certified mail or as provided in the
agreement.”  (Emphasis added.)  The agreement does not set forth any
manner of service, thus, the neutral arbitrator had to serve the parties
personally or by registered or certified mail.  (SAP pp. 4-5.)
Here, based on the accompanying declaration Wald states that the award was
served by email which would not be proper under CCP § 1283.6. Thus, the
Petition does not comply with CCP §§ 1283.6.  
Therefore, because the Petition does not satisfy the
requirements, the Petition is DENIED. 
 
D. Challenge to the Award. 
Code of Civil Procedure § 1285.2 provides that a response to
a petition to confirm an arbitration award may request the court to dismiss the
petition or to confirm, correct or vacate the award. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.2.)  The Code further provides in § 1285.8
that a response requesting such relief “shall set forth the grounds on which
the request for such relief is based. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.8.)  Moreover,
the court may not either vacate or correct the award unless the petition or
response was: 
(a)   …
duly served and filed; or 
(b)   …
duly served and filed and; 
(1)  
All petitioners and respondents are before the court;
or 
(2)  
All petitioners and respondents have been given
reasonable notice that the court will be requested at the hearing to vacate the
award or that the court on its own motion has determined to vacate the award
and all petitioners and respondents have been given an opportunity to show why
the award should not be vacated.
(Code Civ.
Proc., §§ 1286.4, 1286.8.)  
Here, the Court notes that Respondent
Mahaffey filed its original Opposition to the Petition and a Request to Vacate
Award on May 02, 2019. A party may seek an order vacating or correcting an
award in a standalone petition “not later than 100 days after date of the
service of a signed copy of the award on the petitioner.”  (Darby v.
Sisyphian, LLC (2023) 87 Cal.App.5th 1100, 1110, citing to
Code of Civ. Proc. §§ 1285, 1288, 1288.2.)  Alternatively, a party may
seek an order vacating or correcting an award in its response to a prior-filed
petition to confirm that award, as provided in § 1285.2.  (Id.) 
In this case, the deadline for filing that response is 10 days from the date
the responding party is served with the petition to confirm, unless the
deadline is extended by the parties by an agreement in writing or by the Court
for good cause.  (Id. at 1110-1111, citing to Code Civ.
Proc., § 1290.6.)  In Darby, the Court ruled that if a petition to
confirm arbitration award is filed less than 90 days after the award is served,
the request to vacate the award “must be filed and served within 10 days of
service of the petition to confirm.”  (Id. at 1110-1111.) 
However, if the petition to confirm arbitration award is filed more than 90
days after an award is served, the request to vacate the award must be filed
within 100 days of service of the award.  (Id. at 1110-1111.) 
While the 10-day deadline is subject to extension by the parties or the Court,
the 100-day deadline is “otherwise immovable, as the statute setting that
deadline brooks no exceptions.”  (Id. at 1111.)  The Court
concluded that if a procedurally proper petition to confirm arbitration award
is filed and there is no timely filing seeking to vacate or correct the award,
the “trial court ‘shall’ confirm the award.”  (Id. at 1113.)
 
Here, Respondent’s response was filed
beyond the ten days from when it was served with the petition. Petitioner
provides the Court with Proof of Service which states that Respondent was
served with the Petition and notice on April 09, 2019. Respondent did not file
its response to the Petition until May 02, 2019. Thus, the response is
considered untimely. 
 
Moreover, it seems Respondent
appears to misunderstand the purpose of a Petition to Confirm an Arbitration
Award. “[I]t is the general rule that, with narrow exceptions, an arbitrator's
decision cannot be reviewed for errors of fact or law.” (EHM Productions, Inc.
v. Starline Tours of Hollywood, Inc. (2018) 21 Cal.App.5th 1058, 1063.) “Neither the trial court, nor the
appellate court, may ‘review the merits of the dispute, the sufficiency of the
evidence, or the arbitrator’s reasoning, nor may we correct or review an award
because of an arbitrator’s legal or factual error, even if it appears on the
award’s face.” (EHM Productions, supra, at p. 1063-64.) Here, Respondent’s claims
of res judicata or in the alternative that Petitioner is not the correct party
to file the Petition are not proper for the purposes of the Court’s review of
the petition because those claims seek to address the merits of the dispute. CCP
§§ 1285.2 and 1285.8 set for the basis in which Respondent can challenge the
award. Here, Respondent has not done so. Thus, based on CCP §§ 1285.2 and
1285.8 as well as by case law, the Court finds that respondent does not
challenge the Petition under proper grounds. Therefore, because Respondent’s
response is improper under CCP §§ 1285.2 and 1285.8 the Court will not consider
Respondent’s arguments.
 
Accordingly, for the forgoing reasons
the Petition is DENIED.
II.        Conclusion

            
Petitioner Arden Silverman’s Petition
to Confirm Contractual Arbitration Award is DENIED.
 
Moving party is ordered to give
notice.
