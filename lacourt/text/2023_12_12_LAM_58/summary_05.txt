```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a default judgment in the amount of $500,000, as alleged in the Plaintiff's complaint. However, the judge notes that the complaint does not clearly set forth the total amount of alleged damages, which is necessary to provide adequate notice to the defendant. The judge cites several cases that support the requirement for clear notice of damages, including Heidary v. Yadollahi and People ex rel. Lockyer v. Brar. The judge also notes that a judgment for damages arising from fraud would not be jointly and severally liable as to the Defendant Companies. The judge is tentatively ruling that the Plaintiff has not demonstrated any fraud damages and has not proceeded in the manner required to recover punitive damages arising from fraud. The judge is also considering the importance of avoiding multiple judgments in a single case, as stated in Nicholson v. Henderson and Cuevas v. Truline Corp.
