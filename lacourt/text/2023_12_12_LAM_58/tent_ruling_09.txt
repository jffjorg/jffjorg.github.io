 
            This
case arises from an underlying FINRA arbitration. The arbitration involved a
request by Petitioner Haiguang
Hai Yin (Petitioner) to expunge a customer
complaint that was filed in a FINRA arbitration against his associated broker
dealer firm. On September 27, 2023, the arbitrator granted Petitioner’s request
for expungement of the customer complaint and FINRA arbitration from his Central
Registration Depository (CRD) record.
 
            On
November 14, 2023, Petitioner filed a Petition to Confirm the Arbitration
Award. No opposition was filed.
 
Timeliness
 
            No
petition may be served and filed until at least 10 days after service of the
signed copy of the award upon petitioner. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.4.) 
 
            The
proof of service indicates that all parties were served with the arbitration
award on September 27, 2023. (Trotter Decl., ¶ 8, Ex. F.) This petition was
filed on November 14, 2023 and is, therefore, timely. 
                                                                                                                 
Compliance under
Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4
 
            Petitioner seeks to confirm the
arbitration award issued by Arbitrator Kirtley M. Thiesmeyer.  
 
            The Petition complies with Code
Civil Procedure section 1285.4. Petitioner attaches a copy of the agreement to
arbitrate in Paragraph 4(b) of Form ADR-106, Petition to Confirm the
Arbitration Award. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4, subd. (a).)
 
            The other requirements under Code of
Civil Procedure section 1285.4 are met. That is, the award provides the name of
the arbitrator, Kirtley M. Thiesmeyer, and a copy of the award and opinion is
attached to the petition. (Pet., Attach., 8(c); Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4,
subds. (b)-(c).) 
 
Accordingly, the petition is granted.
