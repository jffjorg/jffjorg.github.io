            This
is an action arising from a breach of a loan agreement. Plaintiff Aida
Shahbandeh Masihi (Plaintiff) alleges that Defendants solicited a $400,000 loan
from Plaintiff, representing that the funds would be used to develop a “proven
cure” for Coronavirus/COVID-19 and that the loan would be repaid with interest
(for a total $500,000) by a due date of April 1, 2021. Defendants never
provided written loan documents and never repaid any of the funds, despite
repeated promises.
            
            On
November 30, 2021, a Complaint was filed against Defendants Prexa Santé LLC,
Infusion Pharmacy Network LLC, Integrative Wellness Network LLC, Stem Cell
Therapeutics LA LLC, Robbin Messier, Matthew A. Bennett, and Christine Collins
(Defendants). After filing a demurrer (which the Court overruled), Defendants Prexa
Santé LLC, Infusion Pharmacy Network LLC, Integrative Wellness Network LLC,
Stem Cell Therapeutics LA LLC (collectively, Companies), Robbin Messier,
Matthew A. Bennett, Christine Collins filed an answer. Plaintiff then filed a
motion to strike the answer of Stem Cell Therapeutics LA LLC. On April 27,
2023, the Court entered an order striking the Answer as to all Companies and
entering their defaults.
 
            On
July 18, 2023, the Court entered Judgment against Defendants Companies, in the
amount of $500,000, jointly and severally.[1]
 
            On
July 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a FAC. The Court
granted the motion. On August 15, 2023, Plaintiff filed a FAC alleging claims
for (1) breach of oral contract; (2) account stated; (3) open book account; (4)
fraud and deceit, and (5.) money had and received. On October 2, 2023, default
was entered as to Matthew A Bennet, MD and Robin Messier.
 
            Plaintiff
now moves for default judgment against Defendants Matthew A Bennet, MD and
Robin Messier. Defendant Christine Collins, MD has been dismissed. The request
for entry of default judgment is denied. 
 
Discussion
 
            Plaintiff
seeks default judgment in the amount of $1,500,000 against Defendants Matthew A
Bennet, MD and Robin Messier. 
 
            As
a preliminary matter, the amount requested exceeds the amount sought in the
pleadings and, thus, cannot be recovered on a request for entry of default
judgment.
 
            The Legislature has provided that a default judgment “cannot exceed that
demanded in the complaint.” (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 580, 585, subds. (a), (b).)
“[A] default judgment greater than the amount specifically demanded is
void as beyond the [trial] court's jurisdiction.” (Greenup v. Rodman
(1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 826, [italics added].) A default judgment is also void if
the required statement of damages was not served on the defendant before
the default was taken. (Van Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495,
1521.)
 
Here, the FAC only
seeks damages in an amount “not less than $400,000.” (FAC, Prayer.) As such,
the amount of damages Plaintiff can recover may be limited to $400,000.[2] (See Finney v. Gomez (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 527, 533–536; Traci
& Marx Co. v. Legal Options, Inc. (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 155, 160 [“in
a default proceeding in California, a prayer for relief ‘in excess of’ a
specified dollar amount will result in an award of ‘no more than’ that dollar
amount”].)
 
Moreover, included
in the default judgment request for $1,5000,000 is Plaintiff’s request for an award
of punitive damages against Defendants Messier and Bennett in the amount of
$1,000,000 arising from their allegedly fraudulent conduct. However, no
statement of damages was served on Defendants and the request for entry of
default judgment does not even properly identify the $1,000,000 as special
damages.


            Additionally,
the FAC purports to state claims against Defendants Prexa Sant'e LLC, Infusion
Pharmacy Network LLC, Integrative Wellness Network L.L.C. and Stem Cell
Therapeutics LA LLC despite the entry of default judgment as to these Defendants
in July 2023. At minimum, these Defendants must be dismissed from the FAC. 
 
Further, an entry
of default judgment in the amount requested as to Matthew A Bennet, MD and
Robin Messier might allow Plaintiff to obtain a double recovery on these two
separate judgments. 
 
            It is well established that, regardless of the nature or number of legal
theories advanced by a plaintiff, “[plaintiff] is not entitled to more than a
single recovery for each distinct item of compensable damage supported by the
evidence. (Shell v. Schmidt (1954) 126 Cal.App.2d 279, 291.) Double or
duplicative recovery for the same items of damage amounts to overcompensation and
is therefore prohibited. (Ibid.)” (Tavaglione v. Billings (1993)
4 Cal.4th 1150, 1158–1159.)
 
Here, the
FAC makes clear there was a single injury flowing from the breach of the loan
agreement as to all Defendants.[3]

             
To prevent a double recovery
here, “equity demands credit be given for payments received on the judgment.
Such a balance acts as an offset against the judgment. ‘At common law, a setoff
is based upon the equitable principle that parties to a transaction involving
mutual debts and credits can strike a balance between them.’ ... The right of
offset rests upon the inherent power of the court to do justice to parties
appearing before it. [Citations.]” (Jhaveri v.
Teitelbaum (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 740, 753.) 
 
While it is
unlikely that Plaintiff has recovered any portion of her judgment from
Defendant Companies at this time, an order under Code of Civil Procedure
section 724.110 directing a plaintiff to execute and deliver a partial
satisfaction of judgment “is the appropriate means by which a codebtor on a
judgment may be credited with money received by the plaintiff in offset against
the judgment.” (Jhaveri v. Teitelbaum, supra, 176 Cal.App.4th at p. 752.)
 
Further, the language
in each judgment should state to the effect: “To prevent a double recovery,
damages awarded pursuant to this judgment will not be recoverable to the extent
that such damages are recovered and collected under the other judgment entered
in this action on __________.”
 
            The
Court will set a new hearing and filing date for the order to show cause.
