judgment in a single case should be avoided. “[A]s a general rule there can be
only one final judgment in a single action.” (Nicholson v. Henderson
(1944) 25 Cal.2d 375, 378.) “A final, ordinarily single, judgment is a
prerequisite to appealing from an action, its purpose to avoid piecemeal
appeals.” (Cuevas v. Truline Corp. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 56, 60 [citing
9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Appeal, § 58, p. 113]; see also Kinsmith Financial Corp. v.
Gilroy (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 447, 451 [“The one final
judgment rule is a principle of appellate practice that prohibits review of
intermediate rulings by appeal until final resolution of the case.’”].)


[2]           An argument can be made for entry of
default judgment in the amount of $500,000 because of allegations in the FAC,
specifically, that the
terms of the Loan Agreement provided for repayment to Plaintiff of $500,000,
which included principal and interest, by a due date of April 1, 2021. (FAC ¶
14.) However, absent a specific allegation linking a factual
allegation to requested damages, a complaint's general reference to a loss
amount does not “operate as [a] distinct damage claim[ ]” to establish adequate
notice of damages under Code of Civil Procedure section 580. (Heidary v.
Yadollahi (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 857, 866 [rejecting argument of adequate
notice under section 580 where plaintiffs “fail[ed] to distinguish between allegations
of damages, and allegations of fact which include numbers ”].)
Although a complaint need not necessarily allege a total amount of requested
damages in a single statement to provide sufficient notice under section 580,
subdivision (a), the calculation of the total amount of alleged damages must be
clearly set forth to give the defendant “fair warning” that he or she may be
subject to these damages. (People ex rel. Lockyer v. Brar (2005) 134
Cal.App.4th 659, 667–668; see also In re Marriage of Lippel (1990) 51
Cal.3d 1160, 1166–1167.) 


[3]           A judgment for damages
arising from the fraud would not be jointly and severally liable as to
Defendant Companies and would not be part of this double recovery analysis.
However, as noted above, Plaintiff has not demonstrated any fraud damages and
has not proceeded in the manner required to recover punitive damages arising
from fraud.
