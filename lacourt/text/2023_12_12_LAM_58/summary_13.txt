And here is the summary in English text:

This is a collections action where Plaintiff Korea Trade Insurance Corporation (Plaintiff) seeks entry of default judgment against Defendant Euphoria Textile, Inc. (Defendant) in the amount of $37,781.75. The Complaint alleges that Defendant became indebted to Juno Textile Co., Ltd. in the amount of $30,795.50 and failed to pay the amounts due. Plaintiff filed the Complaint on March 14, 2023, and the Request for Entry of Default against Defendant was granted on May 26, 2023.

The Court previously denied Plaintiff's initial request for entry of default judgment, and now denies Plaintiff's second attempt for entry of default judgment. The Court finds that Plaintiff's evidence for default judgment is inadequate, as Plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence to support the judgment requested. The Court will set a further date for the consideration of a further OSC re entry of default judgment and a date for submission of material in support.
