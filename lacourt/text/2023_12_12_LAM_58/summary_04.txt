And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a request for default judgment against Matthew A. Bennett, MD and Robin Messier in the amount of $1,500,000. However, the judge is concerned that this amount exceeds the amount sought in the pleadings and is therefore void as beyond the court's jurisdiction. The judge is also concerned that the request for default judgment does not properly identify the amount of punitive damages requested and does not account for the fact that the same injury is being pursued against multiple defendants.

The judge is granting the request for default judgment, but is limiting the amount to $400,000, the amount sought in the pleadings. The judge is also directing that the language in each judgment state that the damages awarded will not be recoverable to the extent that they are recovered and collected under the other judgment entered in this action.

Finally, the judge is setting a new hearing and filing date for the order to show cause. The judge is also directing that the plaintiff execute and deliver a partial satisfaction of judgment to credit the codebtor on the judgment with any money received in offset against the judgment.
