And here is the English-text summary:

The judge, Mel Red Recana, has written a tentative ruling in response to a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District. The plaintiff, L.C., filed a childhood sexual abuse action against the defendant on December 8, 2022. The defendant contends that the action fails because AB 218, which amended Code of Civil Procedure section 340.1 and Government Code section 905 to expand the statute of limitations and revive otherwise time-barred claims for childhood sexual abuse cases, is an unconstitutional provision of a public gift to private individuals. The defendant also contends that any extension or revival of civil statutes of limitations is barred by California Constitution. The judge, however, disagrees and concludes that AB 218 does not constitute an unconstitutional provision of a public gift to private individuals because the expenditure of public funds serves the greater public purpose of deterring childhood sexual abuse. The judge also concludes that the defendant's constitutional rights have not been violated. The motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied.
