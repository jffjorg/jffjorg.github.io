In this case, Resolution Economics, LLC is suing Centinela Car Wash, Inc. and Hooman Nissani for alleged unpaid debt of $146,621.50. 

The court previously entered a default against Centinela Car Wash, Inc. because they did not respond to the lawsuit. However, their attorney filed a motion to set aside the default, claiming it was a mistake. The attorney stated in an affidavit that they believed they had filed an answer to the lawsuit but had inadvertently failed to do so.  

The judge granted the motion to vacate the default because the attorney's declaration met the requirements of a mandatory relief provision under California law. This provision allows the court to vacate a default judgment due to an attorney's mistake, even if that mistake is inexcusable.
