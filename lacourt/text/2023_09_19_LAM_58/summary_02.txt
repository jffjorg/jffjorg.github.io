And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to set aside the entry of default. The defendant, Centinela Car Wash, Inc., had failed to file an answer to the complaint, and default was entered against it. The defendant then moved to set aside the entry of default, citing attorney fault. The judge found that the defendant's attorney had unintentionally failed to file the answer, and therefore granted the motion to set aside the entry of default. The judge relied on California Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), which provides for mandatory relief from default judgments based on attorney fault. The judge noted that the purpose of this provision is to alleviate the hardship on parties who lose their day in court due to an inexcusable failure to act by their attorneys.
