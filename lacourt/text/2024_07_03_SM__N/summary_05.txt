And here is the summary in English:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to strike portions of the plaintiff's complaint. The judge rules that the motion is untimely because it was filed after the deadline for responding to the complaint, but notes that the court may still strike material at any time within its discretion. The judge also finds that the defendant failed to include a declaration describing its efforts to meet and confer with the plaintiff before filing the motion, as required by law. The defendant objected to the plaintiff's request for statutory damages of $600, but the judge rules that the plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to support an award of statutory damages. The judge notes that the issue of whether the defendant's holdover was malicious is for the trier of fact to determine.
