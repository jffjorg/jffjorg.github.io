And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling for Case Number 24SMCV00559, a hearing scheduled for July 3, 2024. The Judge indicates that the package of documents submitted by the Plaintiff appears generally acceptable for granting a Default Judgment, subject to the receipt of a revised declaration of nonmilitary service from the Defendant, ASR Development Co. The issue with the current declaration is that it states that "he" (a person) is not a member of the military, while ASR Development Co. is a business entity. The Judge suggests that the Plaintiff should have checked the box indicating that a business is not eligible to serve in the military. If a corrected declaration is submitted, the Judge is prepared to grant Default Judgment, awarding the Plaintiff $375,185.64 in compensatory damages, interest, attorney fees, and costs.
