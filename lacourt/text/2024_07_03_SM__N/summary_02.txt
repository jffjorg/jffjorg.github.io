And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Plaintiff John Oursland's motion for reconsideration of the order granting Defendants Joseph W. Sherman and Catherine Bampoky's motion to be relieved from admissions. The plaintiff argued that the defendants received discovery requests, citing FedEx envelope slips and database confirmation of delivery. However, the court found that the exhibits only show delivery to an address, not specific address, and that there was no signature required to confirm delivery. The court also noted that the defendants' responses to interrogatories were non-code compliant, but this did not conclusively show that the requests for admission were received. The court also found that the plaintiff's arguments based on the lack of returned mail as undeliverable and a request to deny monetary sanctions in response to interrogatories were not sufficient evidence to support the motion. As a result, the motion for reconsideration is denied.
