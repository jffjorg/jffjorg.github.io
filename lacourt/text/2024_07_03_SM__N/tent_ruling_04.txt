The Court finds good cause to continue the hearing.Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (a), provides that “[w]hen a witness is incapable of understanding the English language or is incapable of expressing himself or herself in the English language so as to be understood directly by counsel, court, and jury, an interpreter whom the witness can understand and who can understand the witness shall be sworn to interpret for the witness.” (See also Gov. Code, § 68092.1, subd. (b) [“a court may provide an interpreter in any civil action or proceeding at no cost to the parties, regardless of the income of the parties”].) Accordingly, Plaintiffs Viacheslav Pevchenko and Labazangadzhi Kurbanov’s Motion for a Continuance is GRANTED. Defendant Joshua Romero’s Demurrer to Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint and Motion to Strike Portions of Plaintiffs’ First Amended Complaint are CONTINUED to a date to be determined at hearing. No further briefing will be permitted.
