And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Madjid Khansefid's motion for leave to file a cross-complaint against Plaintiff Jacob Maymudes. The cross-complaint seeks to assert claims for mutual mistake and fraud. The Judge found that the motion was proper because the Defendant learned of the facts supporting the cross-complaint after filing his answer, and there was no apparent prejudice in allowing the filing of the cross-complaint. The Judge noted that the Court has a strong policy in favor of allowing amendments to pleadings, and that prejudice would only exist if the amendment would require delaying the trial, resulting in loss of critical evidence, added costs of preparation, or an increased burden of discovery. Since there was no prejudice, the Judge granted the motion and deemed the cross-complaint filed as of the date of the order.
