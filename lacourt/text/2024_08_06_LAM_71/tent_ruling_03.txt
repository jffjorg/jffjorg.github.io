CRC
Violations
CRC,
Rule 3.1345 provides, in part, “any motion involving the content of a discovery
request or the responses to such a request must be accompanied by a separate
statement. The motions that require a separate statement include a motion: . .
. [¶] (5) To compel or to quash the production of documents or tangible things
at a deposition.”  (CRC, Rule
3.1345(a)(5).)
In
lieu of a separate statement, the court may direct the parties to file a
“concise outline” of the discovery demands and responses in dispute.  (CRC, Rule 3.1345(b)(2) [stating no separate
statement needed “[w]hen a court has allowed the moving party to submit—in
place of a separate statement—a concise outline of the discovery request and
each response in dispute”].)
Plaintiff
failed to submit a separate statement with its motions to quash the subpoenas
on OZK, C&W, Gehry Partners, OKO Group, Rubano, Webcor, and Yucaipa in
violation of CRC, Rule 3.1345(a)(5), or request permission from the Court to
instead file a “concise outline” of the discovery demands and responses in
dispute in violation of CRC, Rule 3.1345(b)(2). 
However, the Court, in its discretion, will consider Plaintiff’s
motions.
 
Meet
and Confer
A
motion to quash a subpoena for business records must be accompanied by a
declaration showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt at informal resolution
of the dispute” between the party requesting the records and the “consumer” or
“employee” whose records are involved or counsel for such person.  (C.C.P. §§1985.3(g), 1985.6(f)(4).)
Plaintiff’s
counsel declares that on March 8, 2025, he sent Defendant’s counsel an email
setting forth Plaintiff’s issues with the instant subpoenas and requesting that
Defendant withdraw the subpoenas and re-issue subpoenas.  (Decl. of King ¶6.)  Plaintiff’s counsel declares Defendant did
not agree to withdraw and re-issue corrected subpoenas, which necessitates the
instant motion.  (Decl. of King ¶6.)
Plaintiff
sufficiently demonstrated a good faith attempt at informal resolution of the
dispute.  (C.C.P. §§1985.3(g),
1985.6(f)(4).)  Accordingly, the Court
will consider Plaintiff’s motions.

Procedural
History
On
February 16, 2024, Defendant served a subpoena duces tecum on OZK requesting OZK
produce eight categories of communications, contracts, and agreements with
Plaintiff regarding real property located at 8150 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles, CA
90046.  (Decl. of King ¶2, Exh. A.)
Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on March 14, 2024. 
Defendant filed its opposition on July 24, 2024.  Plaintiff filed its reply on July 30, 2024.
 
Legal
Standard
“If a subpoena requires the attendance of a witness or the production
of books, documents, electronically stored information, or other things before
a court, or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition,
the court, upon motion reasonably made by any person described in subdivision
(b), or upon the court’s own motion after giving counsel notice and an
opportunity to be heard, may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely,
modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as
the court shall declare, including protective orders. In addition, the court
may make any other order as may be appropriate to protect the person from
unreasonable or oppressive demands, including unreasonable violations of the
right of privacy of the person.”  (C.C.P.
§1987.1(a).)  “The following persons may
make a motion pursuant to subdivision (a): [¶] (1) A party.”  (C.C.P. §1987.1(b)(1).)
A party may only discover matters, not
privileged, that are relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending
action and that are either admissible evidence or “reasonably calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.”  (C.C.P. §2017.010.) 
Broad discovery requests are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery
of admissible evidence.  (See Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Superior
Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 224-225.) 
 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s
motion to quash Defendant’s subpoena to OZK is granted in part and denied in part.
Defendant’s
subpoena to OZK requests the following documents:
1.     All
DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and TOWNSCAPE RELATED TO the PROPERTY.
 
2.     All
DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and TOWNSCAPE RELATING TO the
potential sale or acquisition of the PROPERTY.
 
3.     All
DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and TOWNSCAPE RELATED TO TOWNSCAPE’S
involvement in the potential sale or acquisition of the PROPERTY by any third
party.
 
4.     All
COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and TOWNSCAPE RELATED TO SUNSET-LP on or after March
1, 2023.
 
5.     All
COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and any third party RELATED TO SUNSET-LP on or after
March 1, 2023.
 
6.     All
COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and any third party RELATED TO TOWNSCAPE on or after
March 1, 2023.
 
7.     All
contracts between YOU and TOWNSCAPE and any amendments thereto RELATED TO the
PROPERTY.
 
8.     All
drafts of agreements between YOU and TOWNSCAPE RELATED TO the PROPERTY.
 
(Decl. of King
¶2, Exh. A at pg. 9.)
Here,
Defendant seeks documents that are not relevant to the instant lawsuit. First, the
Complaint and Cross-Complaint allege that as of March 31, 2023, the Property
had been given back to the lender, and at that point, all of the alleged
breaches at issue were complete.  (Complaint
¶14J; Cross-Complaint ¶24.)  The
pleadings also indicate that issues between the parties began in 2019, and the
Cross-Complaint alleges the original agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant was
entered into on or about January 11, 2012. 
(Complaint ¶¶9-10; Cross-Complaint ¶¶6, 17.)  Defendant’s subpoena demands production of
documents from March 1, 2023, through the present day.  (See Decl. of King ¶2, Exh. A at pg.
9.)  Documents from April 1, 2023, to the
present are of no relevance to the subject matter of this litigation and are thus
outside the scope of permissible discovery. 
Therefore, Defendant’s subpoena demands are limited to documents from
January 11, 2012, to April 1, 2023.
Second,
Defendant’s subpoena request in category 6 is overbroad.  The request states, “All COMMUNICATIONS
between YOU and any third party RELATED TO TOWNSCAPE on or after March 1, 2023.”  (Decl. of King ¶2, Exh. A at pg. 9.)  Aside from the abovementioned modification of
the time period for communications to produce, the request must be limited to
communications relating to Plaintiff and the Property to be reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
motion to quash Defendant’s subpoena to OZK is granted in part and denied in
part.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motion to quash Defendant’s subpoena on OZK is granted in part and denied in
part.  
Defendant’s
subpoena demands are limited to documents from January 11, 2012, to April 1,
2023, and Request No. 6 is limited to communications relating to Plaintiff and
the Property.  Plaintiff’s motion is
otherwise denied.

Procedural
History
On
February 16, 2024, Defendant served a subpoena duces tecum on C&W
requesting C&W produce seven categories of communications regarding real
property located at 8150 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90046.  (Decl. of King ¶2, Exh. B.)
Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on March 14, 2024. 
Defendant filed its opposition on July 24, 2024.  Plaintiff filed its reply on July 30, 2024.
 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s
motion to quash Defendant’s subpoena to C&W is granted in part and denied
in part.
Defendant’s
subpoena to C&W requests the following documents:
1.     All
DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and TOWNSCAPE RELATED TO the PROPERTY.
 
2.     All
DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and TOWNSCAPE RELATED TO the potential
sale or acquisition of the PROPERTY.
 
3.     All
DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and TOWNSCAPE RELATED TO TOWNSCAPE'S
involvement in a potential acquisition of the PROPERTY by any third party.
 
4.     All
DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and TOWNSCAPE RELATED TO SUNSET-LP.
 
5.     All
DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and any third party RELATED TO
TOWNSCAPE.
 
6.     All
DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and TOWNSCAPE RELATED TO any debt
brokered by YOU that was secured by the PROPERTY.
 
7.     All
COMMUNICATIONS between Robert Rubano and TOWNSCAPE RELATED TO the PROPERTY
 
(Decl. of King
¶2, Exh. B at pg. 16.)
Here,
Defendant seeks documents that are not relevant to the instant lawsuit. First,
the Complaint and Cross-Complaint allege that as of March 31, 2023, the
Property had been given back to the lender, and at that point, all of the
alleged breaches at issue were complete. 
(Complaint ¶14J; Cross-Complaint ¶24.) 
The pleadings also indicate that issues between the parties began in
2019, and the Cross-Complaint alleges the original agreement between Plaintiff
and Defendant was entered into on or about January 11, 2012.  (Complaint ¶¶9-10; Cross-Complaint ¶¶6,
17.)  Defendant’s subpoena demands
production of “all documents” without a time limitation.  (See Decl. of King ¶2, Exh. B at pg. 16.)  Documents after the breach alleged in the
pleadings to the present are of no relevance to the subject matter of this
litigation and are thus outside the scope of permissible discovery.  Therefore, Defendant’s subpoena demands are
limited to documents from January 11, 2012, to April 1, 2023.
Second,
Defendant’s subpoena request in category 5 is overbroad.  The request states, “All COMMUNICATIONS
between YOU and any third party RELATED TO TOWNSCAPE.”  (Decl. of King ¶2, Exh. B at pg. 16.)  Aside from the abovementioned modification of
the time period for communications to produce, the request must be limited to
communications relating to Plaintiff and the Property to be reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
motion to quash Defendant’s subpoena to C&W is granted in part and denied
in part.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motion to quash Defendant’s subpoena on C&W is granted in part and denied
in part.  
Defendant’s
subpoena demands are limited to documents from January 11, 2012, to April 1,
2023, and Request No. 5 is limited to communications relating to Plaintiff and
the Property.  Plaintiff’s motion is
otherwise denied.

2019, and the Cross-Complaint alleges the original agreement between Plaintiff
and Defendant was entered into on or about January 11, 2012.  (Complaint ¶¶9-10; Cross-Complaint ¶¶6,
17.)  Defendant’s subpoena demands
production of “all documents and communications” without a time limitation or
“on or after March 1, 2023,” a period outside the scope of the pleadings.  (See Decl. of King ¶2, Exh. C at pgs.
23-24.)  Documents after the breach
alleged in the pleadings to the present are of no relevance to the subject
matter of this litigation and are thus outside the scope of permissible

February 16, 2024, Defendant served a subpoena duces tecum on OKO Group
requesting OKO Group produce ten categories of communications with Plaintiff
regarding real property located at 8150 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles, CA
90046.  (Decl. of King ¶2, Exh. D.)
Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on March 14, 2024. 
Defendant filed its opposition on July 24, 2024.  Plaintiff filed its reply on July 30, 2024.
 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s

(Decl. of King
¶2, Exh. D at pg. 31.)
Here,
Defendant seeks documents that are not relevant to the instant lawsuit. First,
the Complaint and Cross-Complaint allege that as of March 31, 2023, the
Property had been given back to the lender, and at that point, all of the
alleged breaches at issue were complete. 
(Complaint ¶14J; Cross-Complaint ¶24.) 
The pleadings also indicate that issues between the parties began in
2019, and the Cross-Complaint alleges the original agreement between Plaintiff
and Defendant was entered into on or about January 11, 2012.  (Complaint ¶¶9-10; Cross-Complaint ¶¶6,
17.)  Defendant’s subpoena demands
production of “all documents and communications” without a time limitation.  (See Decl. of King ¶2, Exh. D at pg. 31.)  Documents after the breach alleged in the
pleadings to the present are of no relevance to the subject matter of this
litigation and are thus outside the scope of permissible discovery.  Therefore, Defendant’s subpoena demands are
limited to documents from January 11, 2012, to April 1, 2023.
Second,
Defendant’s subpoena request in category 10 is overbroad.  The request states, “All COMMUNICATIONS
between YOU and any third party RELATED TO TOWNSCAPE.”  (Decl. of King ¶2, Exh. D at pg. 31.)  Aside from the abovementioned modification of
the time period for communications to produce, the request must be limited to
communications relating to Plaintiff and the Property to be reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Third,
the issue of Request Nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 demanding documents that are
protected from disclosure is not moot as Defendant argues.  The parties entered into a stipulated
protective order on April 24, 2024, which permits OKO to maintain the confidentiality
of the protected documents.  As such,
production of these requests is subject to the relevant protective order.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
motion to quash Defendant’s subpoena to Gehry Partners is granted in part and
denied in part.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motion to quash Defendant’s subpoena on Gehry Partners is granted in part and
denied in part.  
Defendant’s
subpoena demands are limited to documents from January 11, 2012, to April 1,
2023, Request No. 10 is limited to communications relating to Plaintiff and the
Property, and Request Nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are subject to the
relevant protective order entered on April 24, 2024.  Plaintiff’s motion is otherwise denied.

On
February 16, 2024, Defendant served a subpoena duces tecum on Rubano requesting

Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on March 14, 2024. 
Defendant filed its opposition on July 24, 2024.  Plaintiff filed its reply on July 30, 2024.
 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s

11.  To the extent that YOU no longer own any
interest in TOWNSCAPE, DOCUMENTS sufficient to show the terms on which YOU
exited.
 
(Decl. of King
¶2, Exh. E at pg. 38.)
Here,
Defendant seeks documents that are not relevant to the instant lawsuit. First,
the Complaint and Cross-Complaint allege that as of March 31, 2023, the
Property had been given back to the lender, and at that point, all of the
alleged breaches at issue were complete. 
(Complaint ¶14J; Cross-Complaint ¶24.) 
The pleadings also indicate that issues between the parties began in
2019, and the Cross-Complaint alleges the original agreement between Plaintiff
and Defendant was entered into on or about January 11, 2012.  (Complaint ¶¶9-10; Cross-Complaint ¶¶6,
17.)  Defendant’s subpoena demands
production of “all documents and communications” without a time limitation.  (See Decl. of King ¶2, Exh. E at pg.
31.)  Documents after the breach alleged
in the pleadings to the present are of no relevance to the subject matter of
this litigation and are thus outside the scope of permissible discovery.  Therefore, Defendant’s subpoena demands are
limited to documents from January 11, 2012, to April 1, 2023.
Second,
Defendant’s subpoena request in category 6 is overbroad.  The request states, “All COMMUNICATIONS
between YOU and any third party RELATED TO TOWNSCAPE.”  (Decl. of King ¶2, Exh. E at pg. 38.)  Aside from the abovementioned modification of
the time period for communications to produce, the request must be limited to
communications relating to Plaintiff and the Property to be reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Third,
Request Nos. 8 and 9 seek Rubano’s agreements with Plaintiff’s principals is
not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  While Plaintiff acknowledges Rubano is an
employee of C&W, and the Cross-Complaint alleges Plaintiff breached its
duty to Defendant, Defendant’s request for any agreement between Rubano and Plaintiff’s
principals is overbroad.  (See
Decl. of King ¶2, Exh. E at pg. 31.) 
Therefore, Request Nos. 8 and 9 must be limited to agreements “relating
to the Property.”  
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
motion to quash Defendant’s subpoena to Rubano is granted in part and denied in
part.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motion to quash Defendant’s subpoena on Rubano is granted in part and denied in
part.  
Defendant’s
subpoena demands are limited to documents from January 11, 2012, to April 1,
2023, Request No. 6 is limited to communications relating to Plaintiff and the
Property, and Request Nos. 8 and 9 are limited to agreements relating to the

motion to quash Defendant’s subpoena to Webcor is granted in part and denied in
part.
Defendant’s
subpoena to Webcor requests the following documents:
1.     All
DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and TOWNSCAPE RELATED TO the PROPERTY.
 
2.     All
DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and TOWNSCAPE RELATING TO SUNSET-LP.
 
3.     All
COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and any third party RELATED TO SUNSET-LP.
 
4.     All
COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and any third party RELATED TO TOWNSCAPE.
 
5.     All
agreements between YOU and SUNSET-LP and any amendments thereto, including but
not limited to, the Preconstruction Agreement.
 
6.     All
DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS RELATING TO any work that TOWNSCAPE instructed YOU
to perform in connection with the PROPERTY.
 
7.     All
DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS, RELATING TO any work that TOWNSCAPE instructed
YOU to perform in connection with the PROPERTY that was not at the direction
and/or express approval of SUNSET-LP.
 
8.     All
COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and TOWNSCAPE RELATED TO the PROPERTY. 
 
9.     All
DOCUMENTS that YOU provided to TOWNSCAPE RELATED TO the PROPERTY on or after
July 1, 2022.
 
10. All
DOCUMENTS that TOWNSCAPE requested that YOU provide to it on or after July 1,
2022.
 
(Decl. of King
¶2, Exh. H at pg. 45.)
Here,
Defendant seeks documents that are not relevant to the instant lawsuit. First,
the Complaint and Cross-Complaint allege that as of March 31, 2023, the
Property had been given back to the lender, and at that point, all of the
alleged breaches at issue were complete. 
(Complaint ¶14J; Cross-Complaint ¶24.) 
The pleadings also indicate that issues between the parties began in
2019, and the Cross-Complaint alleges the original agreement between Plaintiff
and Defendant was entered into on or about January 11, 2012.  (Complaint ¶¶9-10; Cross-Complaint ¶¶6,
17.)  Defendant’s subpoena demands
production of “all documents and communications” without a time limitation, or
for “All DOCUMENTS that TOWNSCAPE requested that YOU provide to it on or after
July 1, 2022.”  (See Decl. of King
¶2, Exh. H at pg. 45.)  Documents after
the breach alleged in the pleadings to the present are of no relevance to the
subject matter of this litigation and are thus outside the scope of permissible
discovery.  Therefore, Defendant’s subpoena
demands are limited to documents from January 11, 2012, to April 1, 2023.
Second,
Defendant’s subpoena request in category 4 is overbroad.  The request states, “All COMMUNICATIONS
between YOU and any third party RELATED TO TOWNSCAPE.”  (Decl. of King ¶2, Exh. H at pg. 45.)  Aside from the abovementioned modification of
the time period for communications to produce, the request must be limited to
communications relating to Plaintiff and the Property to be reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Third,
Request No. 7 asks Webcor to produce, “All DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS,
RELATING TO any work that TOWNSCAPE instructed YOU to perform in connection
with the PROPERTY that was not at the direction and/or express approval of
SUNSET-LP.”  (Decl. of King ¶2, Exh. H at
pg. 45.)  Plaintiff fails to produce any
evidence demonstrating compliance with the request is impossible.  It does not appear Webcor has objected to
Defendant’s request, and should production prove to be overly burdensome,
mechanisms exist to protect Webcor from such production.    
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
motion to quash Defendant’s subpoena to Webcor is granted in part and denied in
part.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motion to quash Defendant’s subpoena on Webcor is granted in part and denied in
part.  
Defendant’s
subpoena demands are limited to documents from January 11, 2012, to April 1,
2023, and Request No. 4 is limited to communications relating to Plaintiff and
the Property.  Plaintiff’s motion is
otherwise denied.

Party to give notice.

¶2, Exh. G at pg. 52.)
Here,
Defendant seeks documents that are not relevant to the instant lawsuit. First,
the Complaint and Cross-Complaint allege that as of March 31, 2023, the
Property had been given back to the lender, and at that point, all of the
alleged breaches at issue were complete. 
(Complaint ¶14J; Cross-Complaint ¶24.) 
The pleadings also indicate that issues between the parties began in
2019, and the Cross-Complaint alleges the original agreement between Plaintiff
and Defendant was entered into on or about January 11, 2012.  (Complaint ¶¶9-10; Cross-Complaint ¶¶6,
17.)  Defendant’s subpoena demands
production of “all documents and communications” without a time limitation.  (See Decl. of King ¶2, Exh. G at pg. 52.)  Documents after the breach alleged in the
pleadings to the present are of no relevance to the subject matter of this
litigation and are thus outside the scope of permissible discovery.  Therefore, Defendant’s subpoena demands are
limited to documents from January 11, 2012, to April 1, 2023.
Second,
Defendant’s subpoena request in category 7 is overbroad.  The request states, “All COMMUNICATIONS
between YOU and any third party RELATED TO TOWNSCAPE.”  (Decl. of King ¶2, Exh. G at pg. 52.)  Aside from the abovementioned modification of
the time period for communications to produce, the request must be limited to
communications relating to Plaintiff and the Property to be reasonably
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Third,
the issue of Request Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 demanding documents that are
protected from disclosure is not moot as Defendant argues.  The parties entered into a stipulated
protective order on April 24, 2024, which permits Yucaipa to maintain the
confidentiality of the protected documents. 
As such, production of these requests is subject to the relevant
protective order.
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s
motion to quash Defendant’s subpoena to Yucaipa is granted in part and denied
in part.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motion to quash Defendant’s subpoena on Yucaipa is granted in part and denied
in part.  
Defendant’s
subpoena demands are limited to documents from January 11, 2012, to April 1,
2023, Request No. 7 is limited to communications relating to Plaintiff and the
Property, and Request Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are subject to the relevant
protective order entered on April 24, 2024. 
Plaintiff’s motion is otherwise denied.

Party to give notice.
