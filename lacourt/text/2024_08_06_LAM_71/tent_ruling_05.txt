[1] The Court notes Plaintiff filed one reservation ($60
filing fee) for one motion that combines seven motions to quash deposition
subpoenas to third parties.  Each subpoena
must be filed as a separate motion; omnibus motions without separate
reservations in the Court Reservation System (“CRS”) are not permitted.  Therefore, Plaintiff owes this Court $360.00
in Court reservation fees it failed to pay on the instant motions.
