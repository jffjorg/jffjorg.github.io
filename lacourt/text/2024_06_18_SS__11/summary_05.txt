And here is the summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on CVS Health's motion to quash service of summons. The court finds that the People of the State of California have not established purposeful availment or specific jurisdiction over CVS Health. The court notes that CVS Health is a holding company with no regular business operations or employees in California, and that CVS Caremark, a subsidiary of CVS Health, has offices and employees in California. The court also finds that the People's evidence is insufficient to establish purposeful contacts with California. The court grants a discovery continuance to allow the People to conduct further discovery on the jurisdictional facts necessary to sustain their burden of proof.
