[1] To the extent the People intend to rely on the three
alleged CLRA misstatements to allege a fraud-prong claim, the Court
disagrees.  Again, to the alleged
misstatements are time-barred, and the third alleged misstatement does not
specifically regard insulin prices.


[2] Mississippi ex rel. Fitch v. Eli Lilly and Co.
(S.D.Miss. Aug. 29, 2022, No. 3:21-CV-674-KHJ-MTP) 2022 WL 18401603 (“Fitch”)
is distinguishable.  (See Opposition, p.
34 [claiming the Fitch court found that similar allegations stated a
claim against CVS Health under Mississippi law].)  The Fitch complaint “alleged that CVS
Health . . . publicly represented
that it constructs programs to lower the cost of the at-issue diabetes
medications.”  (Fitch, supra,
2022 WL 18401603, at *5, emphasis added.) 
Paragraph 48 is broader and vaguer. 
It has a general reference to “many of the products on CVS Health’s drug
lists” but does not have a specific reference to insulin.  (Complaint, ¶ 48.)
