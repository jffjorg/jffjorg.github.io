Significant Statements:
  - "The anti-SLAPP motion is a procedural remedy, designed to quickly identify and dispose of lawsuits brought to chill the valid exercise of a party's constitutional right of petition or free speech." (Edmon & Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civ. Procedure Before Trial, at Â¶ 7:500.)
  - "The Court disagrees. Camacho is a journalist. He requested the names and pictures pursuant to the Public Records Act. When City refused to produce them, he filed a lawsuit to compel compliance with the statute. Then the case settled, and he published the names and pictures that City produced to him through the settlement. Then Coalition republished them on its website, the same names and photos that were already available to the public due to Camacho's publication."

And here is the English text summary:

The Judge, David S. Cunningham III, has issued a tentative ruling on anti-SLAPP motions filed by Ben Camacho and the Coalition (Stop LAPD Spying Coalition) against the City of Los Angeles. The motions were filed in response to the City's cross-complaint against Camacho and the Coalition. The Judge granted the motions, finding that the City's cross-claims arise from protected activity, namely the publication of police officer names and photos by Camacho and the Coalition. The Judge also found that the City failed to show a probability of success on the merits of its cross-claims.
