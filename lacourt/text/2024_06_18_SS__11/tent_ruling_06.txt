CVS Health’s Demurrer
 
CVS Health’s demurrer is sustained with leave to amend.
 
 
BACKGROUND
 
The People filed this case against three manufacturers of insulin
(Manufacturer Defendants), three pharmacy-benefit managers (“PBM Defendants” or
“PBMs”), and a holding company (CVS Health). 

 
At its core, this is a price-gouging case.  The complaint alleges:
 
1. Millions of
Californians suffer from diabetes. For many diagnosed with this condition,
access to insulin to regulate their blood sugar levels is a matter of life and
death. Yet, the excessive price of insulin undermines their access to this
century-old, life-sustaining drug. 
 
2. Inexplicably,
list prices for insulin have risen several hundred percent over the last two
decades. Today, California diabetics who require insulin to survive and who are
exposed to insulin’s full price, such as uninsured consumers and consumers with
high deductible insurance plans, pay thousands of dollars per year for insulin.

 
3. The excessive
price of insulin disproportionately harms low-income communities who must
choose between paying for insulin or everyday necessities, such as housing and
food. To stretch dollars and insulin supplies, many Californians have turned to
the dangerous practice of rationing insulin or skipping doses despite the
severe risks of loss of sight, limbs, or death. These harms are further
compounded for Black, Hispanic, and low-income communities in California as
they are more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes and to be uninsured or
underinsured. 
 
4. The United States
insulin market is an oligopoly. The defendants include three insulin
manufacturers (Manufacturer Defendants)—Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi—who
make nearly all of the insulin sold in the United States. 
 
5. Also named as
defendants are the three pharmacy benefit managers (PBM Defendants) that
dominate the PBM market—CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, and OptumRx. PBMs are
entities that administer prescription drug programs, which are a part of the
essential benefits that health insurance plans must cover. One aspect of the
PBM’s role is determining the prescription drugs a given health insurance plan
covers (known as a formulary). Another aspect of the PBM’s role is negotiating
confidential contracts that provide for post-sale discounts (rebates) that a
drug manufacturer will provide to the PBM, not the consumer, if a consumer
fills a prescription for the manufacturer’s drug.
 
6. The conduct at
issue in this Complaint has two main components. First, the Manufacturer
Defendants aggressively raise the list price of insulin in lockstep with each
other to artificial levels. The inflated and artificial insulin price increases
have significantly exceeded inflation and are not justified by advances in the
efficacy of the drugs or the cost of manufacturing. Insulin costs less than $10
a month to manufacture and its development costs have long been recouped. 
 
7. Second, PBM
Defendants obtain significant secret rebates, which are a percentage of the
inflated and artificial list price, from the Manufacturer Defendants in
exchange for favorable placement on the PBM’s standard formularies. This
rebating strategy incentivizes the Manufacturer Defendants to raise their list
prices high and higher. The result is that the PBM Defendants’ standard
formularies promote the Manufacturer Defendants’ high list-price insulin
products over lower list-price insulins in California and nationwide. 
 
8. The Manufacturer
Defendants participate in this conduct because being listed on a PBM
Defendant’s standard national formulary is a financial boon. Like the insulin
market in the United States, the PBM market in the United States is also
oligopolistic. The PBM Defendants capture over 75% of the market. Being
included on a PBM Defendant’s standard national formulary drives higher sales
volume and revenue. 
 
9. The PBM
Defendants participate in this conduct because their revenue is related to the
size of the secret rebates they negotiate. Larger list prices support larger
secret rebates because rebates are calculated as a percentage of the list
price. Also, the PBM Defendants have a perverse incentive for ever-growing list
prices. The PBM Defendants claim they can extract higher rebates due to their
market power. If drug list prices grow, demand for their rebate negotiation
services increases. 
 
10. In addition to
participating in conduct raising list prices, Defendants made
misrepresentations about insulin prices and their actions in relation to
insulin prices. 
 
11. By increasing
the list price of insulin, Defendants harm diabetic Californians who require
insulin. They are exposed to insulin’s unaffordable list price and do not
benefit from the secret rebates.
 
12. Defendants are
liable for the harms caused by their conduct under theories that protect
consumers and competition. Defendants’ conduct harms diabetic Californians who
require insulin without a sufficient counterweighing benefit to them.
Additionally, Defendants’ conduct runs against several principles of honesty
and fair dealing with competitors and consumers, including (a) prohibition on
false discounts and prohibition on misleading statements made in furtherance of
the false discounts, (b) prohibition on members of oligopolies abusing their
market power in order to raise their product prices to unconscionable levels,
(c) prohibition on middlemen in product distribution chains with large market
share leveraging their market power to obtain secret rebates from manufacturers
that are not granted to their smaller middlemen competitors, and (d)
prohibition on members of oligopolies adopting practices that facilitate the
coordination of price increases. 
 
(Complaint, ¶¶
1-12.)
 
The complaint contains two causes of action: (1) violation of the UCL;
and (2) unjust enrichment.
 
Here, PBM Defendants and CVS Health demur to both causes of action.
 
LAW
 
When considering demurrers,
courts read the allegations liberally and in context, and “treat the demurrer
as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law.” (Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5
Cal.3d 584, 591.)  “A demurrer
tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters.
Therefore, it lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or
are judicially noticed.”  (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)  It is error “to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the
plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the
defendant can be cured by amendment.”  (Aubry v.
Tri-City Hospital Dist. (1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
PBM
Defendants’ RJN
 
PBM
Defendants seek judicial notice of
legislative reports and hearings (exhibits A through E) and rules published in
the Federal Register (exhibits F through I).
 
The
Court finds that the RJN should be denied because PBM Defendants failed
to submit evidence authenticating the documents.
 
Alternatively, if defense counsel
makes a successful offer of proof at the hearing, the Court’s inclination would
be to grant the RJN since the documents constitute legislative official acts.
 
Tentative Ruling Re:
Manufacturer Defendants’ Demurrer
 
The Court incorporates the tentative ruling on Manufacturer Defendants’
demurrer.  For the most part, the
analysis there applies equally here.
 
PBM Defendants’ Demurrer
 
Statutes of Limitations
 
A four-year limitations period
applies to the UCL (see Stern,
Business and Professions Code Section 17200 Practice (The Rutter Group March
2023 Update) ¶ 5:290), and either a
three-year limitations period or a four-year limitations period applies to
unjust enrichment.  (See Federal
Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Dintino (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 333, 347
[finding a three-year limitations period applicable to fraud-based unjust
enrichment]; see also Opposition, p. 33 [arguing that Code of Civil Procedure
section 343’s four-limitations period should apply because the People’s claim
is equity-based].)
 
PBM
Defendants contend the demurrer should be sustained because both causes of
action accrued prior to 2019, more than four years before the People filed
their complaint.  (See Demurrer, pp.
4-6.)
 
The
People claim the allegations satisfy equitable exceptions, namely, the
last-overt-act rule, the continuing-violation doctrine, and the
continuous-accrual doctrine.  (See
Opposition, pp. 29-33.)
 
Manufacturer
Defendants assert that the equitable exceptions do not apply.  (See Demurrer, pp. 5-6; see also Reply, pp.
1-3.)
 
The
demurrer is sustained with leave to amend. 
The complaint alleges a two-part conspiracy between two oligopolies –
Manufacturer Defendants and PBM Defendants. 
In short, the People claim Manufacturer Defendants agree to artificially
inflate list prices in order to fund large rebates to PBM Defendants “in
exchange for favorable placement on” PBM Defendants’ “standard
formularies.”  (Complaint, ¶¶ 6, 7; see
also id. at ¶¶ 4-5, 8-9, 62, 133-143, 147-176.)  Allegedly, the large rebates “are a
percentage of the inflated and artificial list price[s.]”  (Id. at ¶ 7.) 
The problem is that the People’s own chart shows prices flatlining since 2018 (see id. at ¶ 130), which, seemingly, if
true, could have curtailed, if not ended, the purported rebate scheme.  The People need to provide amended
allegations to address this discrepancy and to show price increases and
actionable conduct during the limitations period.  (See Tentative Ruling Re: Manufacturer
Defendants’ Demurrer, pp. 4-7.)
 
This ruling applies to all three
equitable exceptions.  (See ibid.)
 
UCL
 
Safe
Harbor
 
“If the Legislature has permitted certain
conduct or considered a situation and concluded no action should lie, courts
may not override that determination.”  (Klein
v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1342, 1379
[quoting Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co.
(1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 182].)  “When specific legislation provides a ‘safe
harbor,’ plaintiffs may not use the general unfair competition law to assault
that harbor.”  (Ibid.)
 
This rule “does not . . . prohibit an action under the unfair
competition law merely because some other statute on the subject does not . . .
prohibit the challenged conduct.” 
(Ibid.)  “To forestall an action
under the unfair competition law, another provision must . . . clearly permit
the conduct.  There is a difference
between (1) not making an activity unlawful, and (2) making that activity
lawful.”  (Ibid. [instructing that “a statute
that does not ‘affirmatively permit[ ] [a type of conduct] . . . does not
preclude a court from deeming [such] conduct unfair under the unfair
competition law’”].)  Stated another way,
“the Legislature's mere failure to prohibit an activity does not prevent a
court from finding it unfair.”  (BBBB
Bonding Corp. v. Caldwell (2021) 73 Cal.App.5th 349, 377.)  “[T]o ‘qualify for the “safe harbor” rule,
the defendant must show that a statute “explicitly prohibit[s] liability for
the defendant's acts or omissions” [citation] or “expressly precludes an action
based on the conduct.”’”  (Ibid.)  “If a statute does not ‘explicitly prohibit
liability’ for a defendant's specific acts or omissions, the court may not
create an ‘implied safe harbor.’” 
(Ibid.)
 
PBM Defendants claim the safe harbor applies because federal
and state law “protect[] manufacturers’ ability to ‘voluntarily make pricing
decisions’ and PBMs’ right ‘to negotiate discounts and rebates.’”  (Demurrer, p. 8.)  In support, PBM Defendants cite 42 U.S.C.
sections 1320b-23(b), 1395w-3a(c)(6)(B), and 1396r-8(k)(1)(B)(i)(IV), Health
and Safety Code section 127676(b)(2), and Business and Professions Code section
4441(e).  (See Demurrer, pp. 7-9; see
also Reply, pp. 4-5.)
 
Sections 1320b-23(b), 1395w-3a(c)(6)(B), and 127676(b)(2) do
not help PBM Defendants.  (See Tentative
Ruling Re: Manufacturer Defendants’ Demurrer, pp. 7-11.)
 
Section 1396r-8(k)(1)(B)(i)(IV) defines “average manufacturer
price” and excludes “rebates or discounts” from the definition:
 
(k)Definitions
 
* * *
 
(1) Average manufacturer price
 
* * *
 
(B) Exclusion of customary prompt pay discounts and other payments
 
(i) In general
 
The average manufacturer
price for a covered outpatient drug shall exclude – 
 
* * *
 
(IV)
payments received from, and rebates or discounts provided to, pharmacy benefit
managers, managed care organizations, health maintenance organizations,
insurers, hospitals, clinics, mail order pharmacies, long term care providers,
manufacturers, or any other entity that does not conduct business as a
wholesaler or a retail community pharmacy, unless the drug is an inhalation,
infusion, instilled, implanted, or injectable drug that is not generally
dispensed through a retail community pharmacy
 
(42 U.S.C. § 1396r-8, subd. (k)(1)(B)(i)(IV), emphasis in original.)
 
Section 4441(e) sets certain reporting requirements for PBMs:
 
(e) The pharmacy benefit
manager shall, on a quarterly basis, disclose, upon the request of the
purchaser, the following information with respect to prescription product
benefits specific to the purchaser:
 
(1) The aggregate
wholesale acquisition costs from a pharmaceutical manufacturer or labeler for
each therapeutic category of drugs containing three or more drugs, as outlined
in the state's essential health benefits benchmark plan pursuant to Section
1367.005 of the Health and Safety Code.  
 
(2) The aggregate amount
of rebates received by the pharmacy benefit manager by therapeutic category of
drugs containing three or more drugs, as outlined in the state's essential
health benefits benchmark plan pursuant to Section 1367.005 of the Health and
Safety Code. The aggregate amount of rebates shall include any utilization
discounts the pharmacy benefit manager receives from a pharmaceutical
manufacturer or labeler.
 
(3) Any administrative
fees received from the pharmaceutical manufacturer or labeler.
 
(4) Whether the pharmacy
benefit manager has a contract, agreement, or other arrangement with a
pharmaceutical manufacturer to exclusively dispense or provide a drug to a
purchaser's employees, insureds, or enrollees, and the application of all
consideration or economic benefits collected or received pursuant to that
arrangement.
 
(5) Prescription drug
utilization information for the purchaser's enrollees or insureds that is not
specific to any individual enrollee or insured.
 
(6) The aggregate of
payments, or the equivalent economic benefit, made by the pharmacy benefit
manager to pharmacies owned or controlled by the pharmacy benefit manager.
 
(7) The aggregate of
payments made by the pharmacy benefit manager to pharmacies not owned or
collected by the pharmacy benefit manager.
 
(8) The aggregate amount
of the fees imposed on, or collected from, network pharmacies or other
assessments against network pharmacies, and the application of those amounts
collected pursuant to the contract with the purchaser.
 
(Cal. Bus. & Prof.
Code § 4441, subd. (e).)
 
The
Court agrees with the People that neither of these statutes provides a
safe harbor as to the price-inflation/rebates conspiracy alleged in the
complaint.  (See Opposition, pp. 23-26;
see also Tentative Ruling Re:
Manufacturer Defendants’ Demurrer, pp. 7-11 [analyzing safe-harbor issue and
conspiracy allegations].)
 
The demurrer is
overruled.
 
 
 
Unfair Prong
 
The
UCL’s unfair prong prohibits unfair business practices.  Because the UCL is written in the disjunctive,
“a business practice can be ‘unfair’ . . . even if it is not ‘deceptive’ and
even if it is ‘lawful.’”  (Stern, supra,
at ¶ 3:112.)  “The ‘unfair’ standard is
intentionally broad, allowing courts maximum discretion to prohibit new schemes
to defraud.”  (Id. at ¶ 3:113.)
 
PBM
Defendants contend the People’s allegations fail under the UCL’s
balancing test, Federal Trade
Commission post-1980 test, and tethering test. 
(See Demurrer, pp. 16-19; see also Reply, pp. 8-12.)
 
The Court disagrees. 
The allegations tend to show a price-collusion/rebate conspiracy between
oligopolies.  (See, e.g.,
Complaint, ¶¶ 4-9, 62, 133-143, 147-176.) 
They pass the tests
(assuming, of course, that the People are able to amend to allege misconduct
within the limitations period); thus, the demurrer is overruled.  (See Tentative Ruling Re: Manufacturer
Defendants’ Demurrer, pp. 11-12.)
 
As a result of the People alleging a violation of the unfair
prong, the Court does not need to reach the unlawful and fraud prongs.  (See Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010)
183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1359 [stating that, “[b]ecause the statute is
framed in the disjunctive, a business practice need only meet one of the three
criteria to be considered unfair competition”]; see also Stern, supra, at ¶¶
3:15-3:16.)  The partial-demurrer rule
prevents the Court from striking portions of the cause of action.   
 
Nevertheless, the Court offers the following analysis.
 
Unlawful
Prong
 
“[T]he
UCL permits a cause of action to be brought if a practice violates some other
law.  In effect, the ‘unlawful’ prong . .
. makes a violation of the underlying law a per se violation of [section]
17200.”  (Stern,
supra, at ¶ 3:53.)  “Virtually any
law or regulation – federal or state, statutory or common law – can serve as
predicate for” an unlawful claim.  (Id.
at ¶ 3:56.)  “Thus, if a ‘business
practice’ violates any law – literally – it also violates [section] 17200 and
may be redressed under that section. [Citation.]”  (Ibid.) 
 
The
underlying statute highlighted in the complaint is Civil Code section
1770(a)(13), the Consumer Legal Remedies Act (“CLRA”).  (See Complaint, ¶ 229 [alleging that “Defendants’
acts or practices are unlawful, as that term is used in the UCL, and include,
but are not limited to, violating the [CLRA], Civil Code section 1770,
subdivision (a), subpart (13), by making false or misleading statements of fact
concerning reasons for, existence of, or amounts of, price reductions to analog
insulin”].)
 
The
People point out three alleged misstatements that they contend subsection
(a)(13) covers:
 
* in
2017, “CVS Caremark stated that it ‘[m]anage[s] formulary and leverage
competition to negotiate for lowest-net cost’ and its ‘formulary and
utilization management options helped reduce cost for antidiabetic drugs for
clients’” (Complaint, ¶ 198; see also Opposition, p. 19);
 
* in 2017, an Express Scripts
executive told CBS News that “PBMs work to ‘negotiate with drug companies to
get the prices down’” and that Express Scripts’s “mission [is] to make the use
of prescription drugs safer and more affordable” (Complaint, ¶¶ 200, 201; see
also Opposition, p. 19); and
 
* “OptumRX’s website” contains “a
company video stating that PBMs like OptumRX ‘negotiate with drug companies for
the best medication prices[.]’” 
(Complaint, ¶ 202; see also Opposition, p. 19.)
 
PBM
Defendants respond with three arguments. 
One, “the CLRA has its own safe harbor doctrine that
independently bars the State’s ‘unlawful’ claims.”  (Demurrer, p. 10.)  Two, “PBMs engage in financial transactions
with sophisticated health-plan clients; they do not transact with consumers or
provide ‘goods’ or ‘services’ at all.” 
(Ibid.; see also id. at pp. 11-13; Reply, pp. 6-7.)  Three, the three alleged misstatements do not
include “false or misleading statements about price decreases.”  (Demurrer, p. 10; see also id. at pp. 13-16;
Reply, pp. 7-8.)
 
The first argument is
unavailing.  The CLRA safe harbor is
inapplicable for the same reasons that the UCL safe harbor is inapplicable.
 
The second argument is
persuasive.  “The CLRA broadly applies to
any transaction involving the sale or lease of goods or services to a
‘consumer.’”  (Stern, supra, at ¶ 10:16.)  “The CLRA’s substantive section . . .
prohibits various unfair or deceptive acts . . . ‘in a transaction intended to
result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any
consumer.’”  (Ibid.)  “The Act broadly defines ‘transaction’ as ‘an
agreement between a consumer and
any other person, whether or not the agreement is a contract enforceable by
action, and includes the making of, and the performance pursuant to, that
agreement.’”  (Id. at ¶ 10:18.)  “Broad as it is,” though, “the CLRA only
permits ‘consumers’ to sue.”  (Id. at ¶
10:25.)  A “consumer” is “an individual
who seeks or acquires, by purchase or lease, any goods or services for
personal, family, or household purposes.” 
(Id. at ¶ 10:26.)  The Court’s
understanding is that PBM Defendants transact with “pharmaceutical
manufacturers, health-plan payors, and retail pharmacies[,]” not with
individual “consumers.”  (Demurrer, p.
11.)  Given this distinction, the current
allegations fail to render the CLRA applicable.
 
The third argument is also persuasive.  The first and second alleged misstatements
occurred in 2017; they are time-barred. 
The third alleged misstatement only concerns OptumRX and is merely a
general statement about prescription drugs as opposed to a specific statement
about reducing insulin prices.  These
allegations do not establish a violation of subsection (a)(13).
 
However, the Court is inclined to overrule the demurrer.  The UCL cause of action incorporates all
preceding allegations.  (See Complaint, ¶
225.)  This means it incorporates the
conspiracy allegations.  (See,
e.g., Complaint, ¶¶ 4-9, 62, 133-143, 147-176.) 
At the pleading stage, the Court believes a civil conspiracy – the
purported price-collusion/rebate scheme – can serve as the predicate.  (See Stern, supra, at ¶ 3:56.)
 
That
said, the Court favors granting leave to amend to give the People an
opportunity (if they want) to include new statements under subsection (a)(13)
and/or facts showing violations of a different underlying statute, common law,
etc.  (See Tentative Ruling Re:
Manufacturer Defendants’ Demurrer, p. 14.)
 
Fraud
Prong
 
“The third type of conduct proscribed by [section] 17200
is ‘fraudulent’ business practices.” 
(Id. at ¶ 3:153.)  “A business
practice is ‘fraudulent’ within the meaning of [section] 17200 if ‘members of
the public are likely to be deceived.’” 
(Id. at ¶ 3:154.)  Indeed, “a
plaintiff can prove a prima facie case that a
business practice is ‘fraudulent’ without having to prove intent, scienter,
actual reliance, or damage.”  (Id. at ¶
3:157.)  “Even actual deception is not
required.”  (Ibid.)  “If anything, the prohibition against
‘fraudulent’ business is broad[]” in that “it reaches practices that do not
involve advertising [citation] and that involve no untrue statement.  [Citation.]” 
(Id. at ¶ 3:158.)
 
Paragraph
231 alleges:
 
231. Defendants’
acts or practices are fraudulent, as that term is used in the UCL, and include,
but are not limited to: 
 
a. artificially
inflating the list prices of analog insulin; or 
 
b. making material
misrepresentations regarding or failing to disclose the existence, amount,
and/or purpose(s) of discounts, rebates, and/or other payments offered by the
Manufacturer Defendants to PBM Defendants.
 
(Complaint, ¶ 231.)  
 
PBM Defendants contend the
artificial-inflation claim cannot be asserted against PBM Defendants because
the list prices “are set unilaterally and exclusively by” Manufacturer
Defendants, “and there is no allegation that” Manufacturer Defendants “misreported
them.”  (Demurrer, p. 20; see also Reply,
p. 13.)
 
PBM Defendants claim the
failure-to-disclose-rebating-practices claim fails because the complaint lacks
facts showing materiality and a duty to disclose.  (See Demurrer, pp. 21-22; see also Reply, pp.
13-14.)
 
On balance, the demurrer should
be overruled.  The artificial-inflation
and failure-to-disclose-rebating-practices claims are both founded on PBM
Defendants’ purported civil conspiracy with Manufacturer Defendants – the
alleged price-collusion/rebates plot. 
(See, e.g., Complaint, ¶¶ 4-9, 62, 133-143, 147-176.)  According to the complaint, PBM Defendants’
own conspiratorial conduct contributed to the inflated insulin pricing.  (See id. at ¶¶ 149-162.)  The Court agrees with the People that, at
this stage, at minimum, the allegations give rise to a duty to disclose and
state an omissions-based fraud-prong claim. 
(See Opposition, pp. 21-22.)[1]
 
Unjust
Enrichment
 
Unjust
enrichment is an equitable doctrine.  It
“is based on the idea that ‘one person should
not be permitted unjustly to enrich himself at the expense of another, but
should be required to make restitution of or for property or benefits received,
retained, or appropriated, where it is just and equitable that such restitution
be made, and where such action involves no violation or frustration of law or
opposition to public policy, either directly or indirectly.’”  (City of Oakland v. Oakland Raiders
(2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 458, 478.)  “The elements . . . are the ‘receipt of a
benefit and [the] unjust retention of the benefit at the expense of
another.’”  (Peterson v. Cellco
Partnership (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1583, 1593.)
 
The
demurrer is sustained.  Unjust enrichment
is not a standalone cause of action in the Second District.  (See Tentative Ruling Re: Manufacturer
Defendants’ Demurrer, pp. 14-15.)  
 
The
Court grants the People leave to assert a common count for restitution based on
unjust enrichment as an alternative in case the UCL cause of action gets
dismissed down the road.  (See ibid.)
 
CVS
Health
 
CVS Health claims it “is not
liable for the acts of its subsidiary[y,]” and the People fail to allege facts
sufficient to pierce the corporate veil. 
(Demurrer, p. 24; see also Reply, p. 15.)
 
The People disagree.  They contend the claims against CVS Health
are “based on [CVS Health’s] own conduct.” 
(Opposition, p. 34.)
 
The demurrer is sustained with
leave to amend.  The People focus on paragraphs
48 and 181.  (See ibid.)  Paragraph 48 states:
 
48. CVS Health holds
itself out as deliberately directing, and is therefore responsible for,
CaremarkPCS Health, LLC’s forum-related activities. Among other things: 
 
a. Prior to 2014,
CVS Health bore the name CVS Caremark Corporation. When announcing its name
change in 2014, CVS Health stated that its PBM services would continue to be
known as “CVS/Caremark.” 
 
b. CVS Health
continues to use CVS Caremark to refer to its PBM services on its website and
in other locations. 
 
c. The website
located at www.caremark.com bears the name CVS Caremark. The website is
interactive. Among other things, it allows customers to enter personal
information, such as addresses. 
 
d. CVS Health states
in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that its
“Pharmacy Services segment provides a full range of PBM solutions, including
plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy
network management services and mail order pharmacy.” 
 
e. Likewise, CVS
Health has stated that as part of its PBM services CVS Health: (a) designs
pharmacy benefit plans; and (b) negotiates with pharmaceutical companies to
obtain discounted acquisition costs for many of the products on CVS Health’s
drug lists. 
 
(Complaint, ¶ 48.)  Paragraph 181 states: “Thomas Moriarty, Chief
Policy and External Affairs Officer and General Counsel for CVS Health
testified to similar concerns. He stated, ‘A real barrier in our country to achieving
good health is cost, including the price of insulin products which are too
expensive for too many Americans.’”  (Id.
