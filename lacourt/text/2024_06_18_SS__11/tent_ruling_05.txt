Tentative Ruling Re: Motion to Quash Re: Personal Jurisdiction
 
Date:                           6/18/24
Time:                          9:00
am
Moving Party:           CVS Health Corp. (“CVS Health”)
Opposing Party:        The People of the State of California
(the “People”)
Department:              11

TENTATIVE RULING
 
The hearing on CVS Health’s motion to quash is continued to give the
People an opportunity to conduct discovery regarding purposeful availment.
 
BACKGROUND
 
The People filed this case against three manufacturers of insulin, three
pharmacies, and a holding company. 
According to the complaint, the manufacturers provide rebates to the
pharmacies for filling insulin prescriptions. 
The People claim the publicly reported list prices for insulin are
inflated and misleading because the manufacturers fail to take the rebate
payments into account when they list the prices.
 
Here, the holding company, CVS Health, moves to quash service of the
summons.  CVS Health contends the Court
lacks personal jurisdiction.
 
LAW
 
There are “two types of personal
jurisdiction[,]” general and specific.  (Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. v. Superior Court (2017) 582 U.S. 255, 262 (“BMS”).)
Plaintiff only relies on specific jurisdiction. 
 
“When
determining whether specific jurisdiction exists, courts consider the
‘relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation.’” (Halyard Health, Inc. v. Kimberly-Clark Corp. (2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 1062,
1070.)  “[C]ourts focus on the nature and
quality (not the quantity) of defendant’s activity in the forum state.”  (Edmond & Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide:
Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2023 Update) ¶ 3:240.) “[S]ingle
or occasional acts of the corporate agent in a state” may be adequate as long
as the lawsuit relates to the “in-state activity.”  (Daimler AG v. Bauman (2014) 571 U.S. 117,
127; see also Edmond & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 3:240.1 [“Provided a ‘substantial
connection’ with the forum is created thereby, even a single act may support
specific personal jurisdiction over a nonresident.”].)
 
To exercise
specific jurisdiction, a court must find purposeful availment (the defendant made
purposeful contacts with the forum), relatedness (the litigation arises out of
or relates to the defendant’s forum contacts), and reasonableness (the forum’s “assertion”
of specific jurisdiction “comport[s] with ‘fair play and substantial justice’”).
(Halyard Health, supra,
43 Cal.App.4th at 1070.)
 
Plaintiff bears the initial burden to
establish specific jurisdiction. (See Vons Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Foods,
Inc. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 434, 449.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Purposeful Availment
 
“‘The purposeful availment inquiry . . .
focuses on the defendant's intentionality.  [Citation.]  This prong is only satisfied when the
defendant purposefully and voluntarily directs his activities toward the forum
so that he should expect, by virtue of the benefit he receives, to be subject
to the court's jurisdiction based on’ his contacts with the forum.”  (Pavlovich v. Superior Court (2002) 29
Cal.4th 262, 269.)
 
CVS Health
 
CVS Health claims: 
 
* CVS Health “has no regular business
operations or employees” in California (Motion, p. 3; see also Reply,
pp. 1-2 [discussing Corcoran v. CVS Health Corp. (N.D. Cal. 2016) 169
F.Supp.3d 970, asserting that CVS Health “is a holding company that performs no
functions unrelated to that status[,]” and criticizing the People’s evidence]);

 
* the People
cannot use allegations to meet their evidentiary burden (Motion, pp. 3-4
[arguing that allegations treating subsidiary CaremarkPCS Health, LLC (“CVS
Caremark”) and parent CVS Health “as one and the same” are inadequate to show
purposeful availment]; 
 
* CVS Health
“has ‘no direct involvement in directing, managing, or supervising the
operations or employees of’” CVS Caremark (id. at pp. 4-5; see also Reply, pp.
3-4); and
 
* “CVS
Caremark is not an agent or alter ego of CVS Health.”  (Motion pp. 5-6; see also Reply, pp. 3-4.)
 
The People
 
The People
disagree.  They contend “CVS deliberately
and purposefully availed itself of California’s benefits” by:
 
* having “a
corporate mandate to increase drug rebates” (Opposition, p. 10);
 
* involving
CVS Health employees in (1) “insulin rebate negotiation and contracting”
(ibid.), and (2) “the [Formulary Review Committee (“FRC”)] and [Pharmacy and
Therapeutics] Committee [(“PTC”)] that set the standard (template) formularies”
(ibid.); and 
 
* using the
formularies “nationwide, including in California” (id. at pp. 10-11
[analogizing SK Trading International Co. Ltd. v. Superior Court (2022)
77 Cal.App.5th 378 (“SK Trading”)]).
 
In addition,
the People say they are not arguing:
 
* “for
personal jurisdiction based solely on CVS Health’s status as the parent of” CVS
Caremark (ibid.); 
 
* “that they
can satisfy the purposeful availment only based on” allegations (id. at pp.
11-12); or
 
* “for
personal jurisdiction based on an agency or alter ego theory” (id. at p. 12). 
 
Analysis
 
The Court
starts with CVS Health’s evidence.  CVS
Health cites the declaration of Thomas Moffat, the vice president and senior
legal counsel of CVS Pharmacy, Inc. 
Moffatt declares:
 
4.
CVS Health Corporation is a holding company, and its primary functions are to
issue stock that is traded on the New York Stock Exchange and to file reports
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. CVS Health Corporation also
performs certain other functions related to those primary functions. However,
CVS Health Corporation has no operations unrelated to its status as a holding
company. 
 
5.
CVS Health Corporation is organized under the laws of the State of Delaware,
and its principal place of business is located in the State of Rhode Island. It
has no offices or facilities in California, and none of its limited business
functions regularly occur there. CVS Health Corporation has no assets, income,
employees, or operations in California. CVS Health Corporation is not qualified
as a foreign corporation under the laws of California, it does not have a
registered agent for service of process there, and it is not regulated by any
California state agency. 
 
6.
CVS Health Corporation has agreements with a limited number of senior
executives who are officers of CVS Health Corporation and who are employed by
and provide services to various subsidiaries of CVS Health Corporation. None of
these officers is located in California. CVS Health Corporation has no direct
involvement in directing, managing, or supervising the operations or the
employees of any of its direct or indirect subsidiary companies, including
CaremarkPCS Health, L.L.C. 
 
7.
CVS Health Corporation is a separate and distinct company from CaremarkPCS
Health, L.L.C. Both of these companies observe and enforce corporate
formalities. CaremarkPCS Health, L.L.C. is not a reporting division of CVS
Health Corporation. Rather, it is a separate entity. It has its own governing
documents; maintains its own corporate records, bank accounts, and financial
records; for jurisdictions where required to file separately, files its own tax
returns; funds its own operations, if any; bears responsibility for its own
debts, if any; and has its own managers, who meet separately from the board of
directors of CVS Health Corporation.
 
(Moffatt
Decl., ¶¶ 4-7.)  These facts support CVS
Health’s position, but they do not end the analysis.  
 
“[C]ourts ‘begin[ ] with “the firm
proposition that neither ownership nor control of a subsidiary corporation by a
foreign parent corporation, without more, subjects the parent to the
jurisdiction of the state where the subsidiary does business.”’”  (SK Trading, supra, 77 Cal.App.5th
at 388.)  The result changes, however, if
the parent’s contacts “reflect more than passive investment or ownership of a
subsidiary.”  (Ibid.)  The necessary “question is . . . whether the defendant has
purposefully directed its activities at the forum state by causing a separate
person or entity to engage in forum contacts.” 
(Ibid.)
 
In SK Trading, which the People
cite, the plaintiff alleged that “several oil and gas firms” “participat[ed] in
a multiyear conspiracy to manipulate the California gasoline market[.]”  (Id. at 382.) 
One of the companies – SK Trading, a South Korean corporation – moved to
quash.  The trial court denied the
motion, finding that “SK Trading purposefully directed its activities at
California residents by and through” a subsidiary, “SK Energy, whose employees
made trades on the California spot market and engaged in business in California
on behalf of SK Trading.”  (Id. at
387.)  The Court of Appeal considered the
following evidence and affirmed:
 
. . . In January 2014, SK
Trading conducted its “1st Half 2014 Strategic Meeting” at which it set forth a
plan to improve SK Energy's profits from trading on the spot market in
California. The plan encouraged SK Energy to hire a new trader with California
gasoline trading experience and expertise and called for the promotion of
“alliances” or “joint ventures” between SK Energy and other gas firms.
Thereafter, a business plan was drafted for SK Energy incorporating the
strategies previously discussed.
 
SK Trading subsequently
supported and approved the hiring of former Vitol trader David Niemann as SK
Energy's new west coast gasoline trader. SK Trading received background
information on potential hires, including their trading history and likelihood
of being recruited. SK Trading organized the information that SK Energy
provided to its personnel committee in support of its decision to hire Niemann.
A SK Trading executive interviewed Niemann at SK Energy's headquarters in
Houston and provided final approval for his hire. The SK Trading executive then
reported to the SK Trading CEO that he supported hiring Niemann “given his
focus on teamwork, clear views based on more than 20 years of experience in the
[United States West Coast] market, and decent attitudes.” Niemann thought of SK
Trading as his “management” and accused SK Trading of “micromanaging every
little aspect of the finances.”
 
Executives of both SK
Trading and SK Energy met regularly with Vitol executives throughout 2014 and
2015. In early 2015, SK Trading's CEO reported on a meeting with Vitol's CEO
and Global Distillates Bookleader, among others, at which they “exchanged opinions
on the overall issues of the oil industry such as oil prices” and “Vitol agreed
to make mutual efforts to develop cooperative projects with SK.” In July 2016,
a SK Trading executive visited Houston to meet with, among others, Vitol's west
coast gasoline trader. Vitol's trader informed him that Vitol “has been
achieving good performance record last year and this year through JV [joint
venture] with SK ... in the USWC market” and that their “JV with Niemann is
more effective and creates higher net profits than any other Regional Book.”
The Vitol trader also advised that “[d]ue to [his] lack of experience, he had
quite a tough time in his first year of trading (year 2014), but along with the
super strong trend of USWC market in 2015, he has continued collaboration with
Niemann through Storage, cargo JV, etc.”
 
Throughout the relevant
time period, SK Energy submitted a weekly report to SK Trading. The report
included position and valuation information as well as information on CARBOB
trading and the ongoing coordination with Vitol related to the California market.
 
* * *
 
The record establishes that SK Trading
actively adopted and implemented a plan designed to increase SK Energy's
profits derived from trading on the California spot markets. SK Trading
actively participated in the hiring and management of SK Energy's California
trader and facilitated agreements between SK Energy and Vitol regarding
gasoline sales in California. These are not, as SK Trading suggests, “general
management activities common to parent-subsidiary relationships.” In Sonora
Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 523, 552,
99 Cal.Rptr.2d 824, the court emphasized that “[t]he critical acts may be taken
directly by the parent or indirectly through the subsidiary, but in all events
must be attributable to the parent corporation itself. Thus, the theory does
not rest on a finding that the subsidiary is a sham corporation or an agent or
representative of the parent. Rather, the focus is on the acts of the parent
itself.” Here, the record establishes that SK Trading officers personally and
directly participated in making the decisions affecting the California gasoline
market that the People allege violated California law.
 
(Id. at 385-386, 388,
underlining of case name added.)
 
The Court turns to the People’s
evidence.  The People cite eight
exhibits.  The Court will discuss them
individually.
 
Exhibit H is testimony from Dr. Alan
Lotvin, CVS Health’s executive vice president and chief transformation officer,
during a motion hearing in a federal case called United States v. CVS Health
Corp.  Dr. Lotvin testified that,
“across the entire” CVS corporate family, “the mandate . . . is to grow the
business[,]” which necessitates “winning new clients.”  (The People’s Exhibit List, Ex. H, p.
305.)  The testimony says nothing about
California contacts by either CVS Health or CVS Caremark.
 
Exhibit M is a July 2013 rebate contract
between CVS Caremark and Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC (“Sanofi”).  The People pinpoint page CVSCM_SFC_0003995,
the signature page of the contract.  (See
Opposition, p. 10 [misnumbering the page as CVSCV_SFC_0003995.)  It contains signatures from CVS Caremark’s
senior vice president of trade relations and two Sanofi vice presidents.  (See the People’s Exhibit List, Ex. M, p.
CVSCM_SFC_0003995.)  There is no mention
of CVS Health.
 
Exhibit N is
a printout of Gary Loeber’s LinkedIn profile. 
No specific page is pinpointed. 
(See Opposition, p. 10.)  Loeber
is the person who signed the exhibit M rebate contract on behalf of CVS
Caremark.  The LinkedIn profile suggests
that he also worked for CVS Health at that time; however, the page does not
establish that signed the contract in his capacity as a CVS Health
employee.  (See the People’s Exhibit
List, Ex. N, p. 003.)  Moreover, the
website is unauthenticated and unverified.[1]
 
Exhibit O is
a testimony from Joseph Anderson in a federal case called In re EpiPen
(Epinephrine Injection, USP) Marketing, Sales Practices & Antitrust
Litigation.  The People do not
explain who Anderson is.  The pinpoint is
page 51 (see Opposition, p. 10), which states:
 
THE
WITNESS: So if I -- I recall, the statement I made was that one of the -- one
of the roles that FRC plays is ensuring that the -- that the recommendations,
you know, focus on those that must align with the priorities and strategies of
CVS Caremark and its clients. 
 
In
general, that -- that is, you know, based on the, you know, the formulary that
a particular client has chosen, you know, trying to deliver the -- the lowest
net cost, manage a clinically appropriate formulary, provide, you know, you
know, formulary, you know, services to those clients that, you know, that we
believe are, you know, competitive in the market.
 
(The People’s Exhibit List, Ex. O, p. 51.)  CVS Health is not discussed.
 
Exhibit Q is
a list of CVS Health’s PTC participants. 
Most of the participants are unnamed. 
The extent of the California connection shown on the face of the list is
that a couple of the unnamed participants are licensed to practice medicine in
California.  (See id. at Ex. Q, pp. 001,
004.)  Purposeful availment requires
more.   
 
Exhibit R is
an August 2019 letter from CVS Health’s counsel to United States Senators
Charles Grassley and Ron Wyden.  The
People highlight pages three through five. 
While the pages do address the FRC and PTC, they do not address
California, let alone targeted contacts. 
(See the People’s Exhibit List, Ex. R, pp. 3-5).  Indeed, at most, the letter shows contacts
targeted at Washington, DC. 
 
Exhibit T is
a July 2015 declaration from Brian McCarthy in a federal case called Pharmaceutical
Care Management Association v. Rutledge. 
McCarthy is the chief operating officer of the Pharmaceutical Care
Management Association.  The pinpointed
paragraphs are paragraphs two through 4 and 6: 

 
2.
Pharmacy Benefit Managers ("PBM" or ''PBMs") administer
prescription drug plans for more than 236 million Americans covered by
self-funded and insured ERISA-governed employee health benefit plans, health
plans offered by non-profit hospital or medical services corporations, health
insurers, health maintenance organizations, and union-sponsored plans. PBMs
also administer pharmaceutical benefit plans for state governments, as well as
Federal programs including Medicare Part D, Medicaid, and the Federal Employee
Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). Each Member PBM conducts business nationwide.
 
3.
Plaintiff PCMA is a non-profit 50l(c)(6) corporation organized in 2002 under
the laws of laws of the State of Delaware. It is the national trade association
representing PBMs. PCMA currently comprises the following eleven member
companies: Aetna, Cigna, Catamaran, CVSHealth, Express Scripts, Humana Pharmacy
Solutions, LDI, Medlmpact Healthcare System, Optum Rx, Prime Therapuetics, and
USScript (collectively, Member PBMs"). The Member PBMs comprise the
largest PBMs in the country and account for approximately 75% of annual
prescription volume nationwide, as of the latest figures available, from the
third quarter of 2012. 
 
4.
As reflected in PCMA's certificate of incorporation, a true copy of which is
attached hereto as Exhibit A, PCMA's purpose is as follows: 
 
(a)
to advance the common interests of these companies engaged in the business of
pharmaceutical care management; (b) to improve the safety and affordability of
prescription drug services; ( c) to advance pharmaceutical care management as
the most effective means of delivering prescription drug care; ( d) to lead,
educate and advocate on behalf of those companies engaged in pharmaceutical
care management; and ( e) to do everything necessary, proper, advisable, or
convenient for the accomplishment of PCMA's purposes . . . .
 
6.
PCMA fulfills this purpose in part by leading industry initiatives on
legislation and regulation. As part of its legal strategy, PCMA also initiates
litigation on behalf of Member PBMs to challenge those laws and regulations
that cause the Member PBMs undue harm. On information and belief, PCMA has
brought four such challenges since its founding, including the present
litigation regarding Act 900.
 
(Id. at Ex.
T, ¶¶ 2-4, 6; see also Opposition, pp. 10, 11.) 
The declaration is unauthenticated, the statements are unverified, and
the statements fail to establish contacts targeted at California as opposed to
generic targeting of the nation.
 
Exhibit W is
a January 2021 SAG-AFTRA summary plan description.  The People cite page 57.  (See Opposition, p. 10.)  Among other things, it states that “[t]he
Plan uses Caremark’s Advanced Control Formulary, which is a list of covered
brand-name and generic medications.” 
(The People’s Exhibit List, Ex. W, p. 57 [also numbered as page 002].)  CVS Health is not named, nor do the
statements show direction and participation.
 
On the
current record, the People’s showing is insufficient to satisfy their burden,
and SK Trading is distinguishable.
 
The Court finds that a discovery
continuance should be granted.  (See
Opposition, pp. 14-15 [requesting a discovery continuance]; see also In re
Automobile Antitrust Cases I & II (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th
100, 127 [“A plaintiff attempting to assert personal jurisdiction over a
nonresident defendant is entitled to an opportunity to conduct discovery of the
jurisdictional facts necessary to sustain its burden of proof.”].)
 
Relatedness
 
For the relatedness prong, “‘the suit’
must ‘aris[e] out of or relat[e] to the defendant’s contacts with the
forum.’”  (BMS, supra, 582 U.S. at
262.)  “In other words, there must be ‘an
affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy, principally, [an]
activity or occurrence that takes place in the forum State and is therefore
subject to the State’s regulation.’” 
(Id.)
 
This prong appears to be
uncontested.  CVS Health does not address
it in the moving brief.
 
Reasonableness
 
“Finally, it must appear that the
exercise of jurisdiction by local courts in the particular case would ‘comport
with fair play and substantial justice.’” 
(Edmond & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 3:244.)  “The burdens on the nonresident must clearly
outweigh the plaintiff’s and forum’s interests.”  (Id. at ¶ 3:247.)
 
This prong also appears to be
uncontested.  The moving brief is
silent.
