```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has decided to continue the hearing on the motion to seal confidential information. The judge has granted the plaintiffs' request to file a motion to use pseudonyms, which is a necessary step before the court can consider the motion to seal. The judge has also noted that the parties' agreement to seal documents is not enough to support a motion to seal, and that only the specific words of documents that constitute the sensitive material should be sealed. The judge has emphasized the importance of the public's right of access to court records and has emphasized that the court may permit a plaintiff to proceed under a fictitious name when exceptional circumstances justify protecting the plaintiff's true identity.
