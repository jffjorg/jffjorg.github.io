TENTATIVE RULING
 
The hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion
to seal is continued.
 
The Court grants Plaintiffs leave
to file a motion to use pseudonyms.  
 
BACKGROUND
 
In October 2021, journalist Ben
Camacho filed a Public Records Act request for a roster and photos of all
police officers employed by the Los Angeles Police Department (“LAPD”).  The City of Los Angeles (“City”) refused to
produce the roster and photos, so Camacho filed a lawsuit to compel
production.  
 
In September 2022, City settled
the lawsuit.  City agreed to “produc[e]
pictures of all full-time, active duty” LAPD officers, “except for officers
then working in an undercover capacity as of July 2022.”  (City’s Anti-SLAPP Motion, p. 5.)  During the production, though, City
“inadvertently included” the names and pictures of some undercover officers.  (Ibid.) 
Camacho then published the names and pictures online.
 
“Six months later, in March
2023,” Coalition “republished” the names and pictures “on a website it had
created, watchthewatchers.net.” 
(Coaltion’s Anti-SLAPP Motion, p. 2.)
 
“In September 2023, over 800
anonymous individuals filed the present pair of damages actions.”  (Id. at p. 3.)  “[P]laintiffs claim they are current and
retired LAPD officers whose identities had been secret until the City made them
public.”  (Ibid.)
 
In January 2024, City filed a
cross-complaint against Camacho and Coalition for equitable indemnity and
contribution.
 
On February 29, 2024, Camacho and
Coalition moved under the anti-SLAPP statute to strike City’s cross-claims.
 
On March 22, 2024, the Court
heard the motions but ended up continuing the hearing.
 
Here, Plaintiffs move to seal a Confidential Matrix, which
contains each Plaintiff’s first and last names and other personal information.
 
LAW
 
Sealing
 
The court may order that a record be filed under seal only if
it expressly finds facts that establish: 
 
(1)  
There exists an
overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record;
 
(2)  
The overriding
interest supports sealing the record; 
 
(3)  
A substantial
probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the
record is not sealed; 
 
(4)  
The proposed sealing
is narrowly tailored; and 
 
(5)  
No less restrictive
means exist to achieve the overriding interest.
 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule
2.550(d).) “These findings embody constitutional requirements for a request to seal court records,
protecting the First Amendment right of public access to civil trials.  (Edmon
& Karnow, Cal. Practice Guide: Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter
Group June 2023 Update) ¶ 9:418, emphasis in original.) 
 
The
parties’ agreement to seal documents is not enough to support a motion to
seal.  (Id. at ¶ 9:417.1 [“Parties
sometimes operate under an informal arrangement pursuant to which documents are
‘deemed filed under seal’ unless an objection is made. Such an arrangement ‘is
entirely inconsistent with the mandatory requirements of rules 2.550 and 2.551
and the constitutional values informing those requirements.’”].)
 
“Only
the specific words of documents that constitute the sensitive material should
be sealed; generally, it is not permissible to seal the entire document.”  (Id. at ¶ 9:418.5.)
 
Pseudonyms
 
“Filing
a complaint as a ‘Doe’ impairs the public’s right of access to court records [citations].  It also violates the statutory requirement
that a complaint include ‘names of all the parties’ [citation].  Therefore, plaintiffs are not permitted to use
fictitious names (e.g., ‘John Doe’ or ‘Jane Doe’) absent ‘exceptional
circumstances.’  [Citations.]”  (Id. at ¶ 2:136.5.)
 
“A court may permit [a] plaintiff
to proceed under a fictitious name when exceptional
circumstances justify protecting [the]
plaintiff's true identity[.]”  (Id. at ¶
2:136.6, emphasis in original.)  Examples
of exceptional circumstances include:
 
* “matters
of a highly sensitive and personal nature (e.g., prior criminal history,
HIV-positive status, victim of sexual assault) [citation]” (ibid.); or
 
* “a
real danger of physical or mental harm to plaintiff or others” (ibid.); or
 
* “where the injury sought
to be avoided by the complaint (e.g., invasion of plaintiff’s privacy) would be
incurred by disclosure of plaintiff’s identity. [Citation.]”  (Ibid.)
 
“The test for whether a party can be permitted to use a pseudonym
has also been termed the ‘overriding interest test’ – the same used for sealing
requests[.]”  (Ibid.).  “A party’s request for anonymity should be
granted only if the court finds that an overriding interest will likely be
prejudiced without use of a pseudonym, and that it is not feasible to protect
the interest with less impact on the constitutional right of access.”  (Department of Fair Employment and Housing
v. Superior Court (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 105, 111 (“DFEH”).)  
 
“In deciding the issue the court must bear in mind the
critical importance of the public’s right to access judicial proceedings.
Outside of cases where anonymity is expressly permitted by
statute, litigating by pseudonym should occur ‘only in the rarest of
circumstances.’”  (Id. at 111-112.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Camacho and Coalition contend the motion to seal should be
denied or the hearing should be continued because, first, Plaintiffs need to
file a motion to use pseudonyms.  (See
Joint Opposition to Motion to Seal, pp. 3-5.)
 
Plaintiffs claim the sealing and pseudonyms issues involve
the same standard and can be heard at the same time.  They contend the motion to seal subsumes the
pseudonyms issue.  (See Reply to Motion
to Seal, p. 7.)  
 
“Procedurally, because a hearing is required, a party who
wants to proceed anonymously will file the initial complaint or petition conditionally under a pseudonym and then move for an order granting
permission to proceed that way.”  (DFEH,
supra, 82 Cal.App.5th at 111 n.1, emphasis in original.)  “If the request is granted, the initial
pleading can remain.  If pseudonym use is
denied, the pleading must be amended to state the party's true name.”  (Ibid.)
 
Given these rules, the Court finds that the hearing should be
continued.  Plaintiffs filed the lead
case in early September 2023.  Two
related cases have been filed since then. 
In all three complaints, Plaintiffs use pseudonyms in place of their
real names, but they have never moved for an order to “proceed
pseudonymously.”  (Joint Opposition to
Motion to Seal, p. 5.)  Even the moving
brief for the motion to seal fails to address the pseudonyms issue (Plaintiffs
discuss it for the first time in the reply brief).  (See Motion to Seal, pp. 12-14; see also
Reply to Motion to Seal, p. 7.)  As a
result, the motion to seal is out of procedural order and puts the cart before
the horse.  Continuing the hearing to
give Plaintiffs a chance to file an appropriate pseudonyms motion will cure
this procedural defect.
