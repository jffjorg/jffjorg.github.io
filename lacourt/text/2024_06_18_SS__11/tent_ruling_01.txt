TENTATIVE RULING
 
Camacho’s and Coalition’s anti-SLAPP motions to strike are
granted.  
 
BACKGROUND
 
In October 2021, journalist Ben
Camacho filed a Public Records Act request for a roster and photos of all
police officers employed by the Los Angeles Police Department (“LAPD”).  City refused to produce the roster and
photos, so Camacho filed a lawsuit to compel production.  
 
In September 2022, City settled
the lawsuit.  City agreed to “produc[e]
pictures of all full-time, active duty” LAPD officers, “except for officers
then working in an undercover capacity as of July 2022.”  (City’s Anti-SLAPP Motion, p. 5.)  During the production, though, City
“inadvertently included” the names and pictures of some undercover officers.  (Ibid.) 
Camacho then published the names and pictures online.
 
“Six months later, in March
2023,” Coalition “republished” the names and pictures “on a website it had
created, watchthewatchers.net.” 
(Coaltion’s Anti-SLAPP Motion, p. 2.)
 
“In September 2023, over 800
anonymous individuals filed the present pair of damages actions.”  (Id. at p. 3.)  “[P]laintiffs claim they are current and
retired LAPD officers whose identities had been secret until the City made them
public.”  (Ibid.)
 
In January 2024, City filed a
cross-complaint against Camacho and Coalition for equitable indemnity and
contribution.
 
On February 29, 2024, Camacho and
Coalition moved under the anti-SLAPP statute to strike City’s cross-claims.
 
On March 22, 2024, the Court
heard the motions but ended up continuing the hearing.
 
Here, the Court considers whether
the motions should be granted.
 
LAW
 
“The Legislature has authorized a special motion to strike
that may be filed against ‘SLAPP’ suits (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public
Participation).”  (Edmon & Karnow,
Cal. Practice Guide: Civ. Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group June 2023
Update) ¶ 7:500.)  “The anti-SLAPP motion
is a procedural remedy, designed to quickly identify and dispose of lawsuits
brought to chill the valid exercise of a party's constitutional right of
petition or free speech.”  (Ibid.)  
 
“Courts use a two-step process for determining whether an action
or a claim is a SLAPP suit subject to a special motion to strike.”  (Ibid.)  “Plaintiff’s claim must (1) arise out of
defendant’s protected speech or petitioning; and (2) lack even minimal merit.”  (Ibid., emphasis in original.)
 
“Commonly, the court first determines whether plaintiff’s
claims arise out of protected activity – i.e., whether the claim against
defendant is predicated on defendant's exercise of a constitutional right of
free speech or petition.”  (Ibid.)  “It is defendant’s burden to show the claim
arises out of protected activity.  If
that burden is not met, the motion will be denied.”  (Ibid.)
 
“If defendant meets the first prong burden, the burden shifts
to plaintiff to show the probability that plaintiff will succeed on the merits
of the claim.”  (Ibid.)  “In other words, even if the conduct for which
defendant is being sued implicates defendant’s free speech or petition rights,
the lawsuit may proceed if plaintiff makes a prima facie showing that the claim
has merit.”  (Ibid.)
 
DISCUSSION
 
Camacho and Coalition
 
Comacho and Coalition contend
their motions should be granted because:
 
* City’s cross-claims “arise[]
from protected activity” (Camacho’s Anti-SLAPP Motion, p. 4; see also
Coalition’s Anti-SLAPP Motion, p. 5 [asserting that the cross-claims arise from
“either requesting public records . . . or publishing public records”]); 
 
* Camacho’s conduct and
Coalition’s conduct “address[ed] an issue of public interest in a public forum”
(Camacho’s Anti-SLAPP Motion, p. 6, emphasis deleted; see also Coalition’s
Anti-SLAPP Motion, pp. 5-7 [claiming the conduct “implicated a public issue”
and “connected to conversation about the public issue”], emphasis deleted); and

 
* “City cannot show a probability
of success” (Camacho’s Anti-SLAPP Motion, p. 8, emphasis deleted; see also
Coalition’s Anti-SLAPP Motion, pp. 7-15 [claiming the contribution cross-claim
is unripe and the cross-claim for equitable indemnity fails because Plaintiffs’
underlying causes of action are “[un]likely to succeed against [] Coalition”
since (1) the First Amendment “bars any liability[,]” (2) Plaintiffs cannot
satisfy the elements of their claims, (3) “Coalition does not know who the over
800” Plaintiffs “are[,]” and (4) Plaintiffs’ claims “are meritless against []
City”], emphasis deleted.)
 
City
 
City disagrees.  City contends the motion should be denied
because:
 
* it “violates” the Court’s stay
order (Opposition, p. 3, emphasis deleted);
 
* Camacho and Coalition “cannot
file an anti-SLAPP motion based on the act of filing a cross-complaint iself”
(ibid.; see also id. at p. 4); and 
 
* the cross-claims do not arise
out of protected conduct (see id. at p. 4 [asserting that requesting and
publishing photos of undercover cops “are not ‘protected activities’”]).
 
Alternatively, City contends
Plaintiffs’ underlying claims should be dismissed if Coalition’s motion is
granted because the cross-claims constitute derivative claims and “are . . .
based on the adequacy of” Plaintiffs’ claims. 
(Id. at p. 4.)  
 
Joint Reply
 
In reply, Camacho and Coalition
assert:
 
* City failed to serve the
opposition brief (see Joint Reply, p. 2);
 
* the stay order does not cover
Camacho and Coalition (see id. at pp. 3-5);
 
* “[d]efeating indemnification or
contribution claims does not extinguish the liability of the party seeking
indemnification” (id. at p. 5, emphasis deleted);
 
* the anti-SLAPP statute applies
to City’s cross-claims (see id. at pp. 6-7); and
 
* putting Camacho’s and
Coalition’s motions on hold until Plaintiffs’ underlying claims are resolved
via summary judgment or trial would be improper (see id. at pp. 7-9).
 
Analysis
 
The first two issues – whether
Camacho and Coalition filed their motions in violation of the stay order and
whether City’s opposition should be stricken for lack of service – have been
resolved.  The Court addressed these
issues in the March 22nd ruling. 
(See 3/22/24 Ruling Re: Anti-SLAPP Motions to Strike, pp. 3-5.)
 
The third issue – whether Camacho
and Coalition are prohibited from “fil[ing] an anti-SLAPP motion based on the
act of filing a cross-complaint” (Opposition, p. 3) – weighs in Camacho’s and
Coalition’s favor.  Their motions target
the substance of City’s cross-claims, not the fact that City filed a
pleading.  Anti-SLAPP motions can be used
for this purpose.  (See Joint Reply, p.
6.) 
 
The next issue is whether City’s
causes of action arise out of Camacho’s and Coalition’s “protected speech or petitioning[.]”  (Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶ 7:500.)  City’s cross-complaint contains two causes of
action – equitable indemnity and contribution. 
The premise of the causes of action is that Camacho and Coalition are
partly or totally responsible for Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries because they are
the ones who published the names and pictures. 
(See, e.g., Cross-Complaint, ¶¶ 15, 21-22, 24-25.)  As noted above, City claims requesting
and publishing names and photos of undercover officers “are not ‘protected
activities’.”  (Opposition, p. 4.)
 
The Court disagrees.  Camacho is a journalist.  He requested the names and pictures pursuant
to the Public Records Act.  When City
refused to produce them, he filed a lawsuit to compel compliance with the
statute.  Then the case settled, and he
published the names and photos that City produced to him through the
settlement.  Then Coalition republished
them on its website, the same names and photos that were already available to
the public due to Camacho’s publication. 
All of these acts involved protected speech and petitioning, especially
given the broad right of the press to publish confidential matters, even police
personnel files, when they relate to issues of public interest – e.g., police
accountability.  (See, e.g., Association
for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs v. Los Angeles Times Communications LLC
(2015) 239 Cal.App.4th 808, 815-821; see also Camacho’s Anti-SLAPP
Motion, pp. 4-8 [discussing cases]; Coalition’s Anti-SLAPP Motion, pp. 4-7
[similar].)
 
City’s suggestion – that Camacho
breached the settlement by publishing inadvertently produced names and pictures
(see Opposition, p. 4 [stating that the settlement parties “agreed to exclude”
undercover officers “from the settlement”]) – does not change the result.  “Speech or petitioning activity that is
‘illegal as a matter of law’ is not constitutionally protected and falls
outside the protection of the anti-SLAPP statute.”  (Burke, Anti-SLAPP Litigation (The Rutter
Group October 2023 Update) ¶ 6:46.)  “‘Illegal’
means criminal behavior[.]”  (Id. at ¶
6:48, emphasis deleted.)  “The mere
showing of an alleged statutory or common-law violation” is not enough.  (Ibid.; see also, e.g., Bergstein v.
Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th
793.)  City fails to show that the
purported breach constitutes a crime or that another exception applies.  (See Opposition, pp. 3-4.)[1]    
 
The first prong is satisfied.
 
The final issue is whether City
shows a probability of success.  (See Edmon & Karnow, supra, at ¶
7:500.)  City bears the burden of proof
(see ibid.), yet it did not submit evidence, and it fails to discuss the
merits.  (See Opposition, pp. 2-5.)  Instead, City contends: 
 
* the Court should not decide Camacho’s and Coalition’s
motions until City’s anti-SLAPP motion is resolved (see Opposition, p. 4); or,
 
* if “the Court is inclined to grant” Camacho’s and
Coalition’s motions, Plaintiffs’ claims against City must also be dismissed now
because the cross-claims are derivate (id. at p. 3; see also id. at pp. 4-5).
 
Both points fail.  The
Court determined at a prior status conference that it will hear Camacho’s and
Coalition’s motions first.  Moreover,
“[w]hether a defendant should be indemnified by a third party does not dictate
whether the defendant is liable to the plaintiffs.”  (Joint Reply, p. 5.)  City’s cases do not
hold otherwise.  (See Prince v.
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (2009) 45 Cal.4th 1151, 1155
[granting summary judgment, finding that the power company’s statutory
immunity from direct liability for the minor’s injury precluded the property
owner’s indemnity cross-claim against the power company]; see also Leko v.
Cornerstone Building Inspection Service (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th
1109, 1115 [reversing judgment on the pleadings and summary judgment,
finding that “public policy does not preclude a realtor from seeking equitable
indemnity against a home inspection company in an appropriate case”].)[2]
 
Also, as explained in the tentative ruling on City’s motion
to compel anti-SLAPP discovery,  
 
[t]he Court agrees
[with City] that the First Amendment is not absolute, but the alleged threats
[] do not appear to change the result. 
City highlights a series of purported Twitter (now X) postings by a
person named Steven William Sutcliffe. 
[Citation.]  Twitter is a separate
website.  There is no allegation of a
connection, then or now, between Sutcliffe and Camacho or Coalition.  [Citations.] 
At most, the pleadings indicate that an unconnected third party included
a link to Coalition’s website in some of his posts, a website, it is worth
repeating, where Coalition republished names and photos that a journalist had
already published to the public.  City
does not cite a case with similar facts that extends indemnity and contribution
this far.
 
Nor does City
explain how the requested discovery could overcome Camacho’s and Coalition’s
non-First Amendment legal arguments. 
Indeed, City does not even respond to those arguments.  [Citations.]
 
(6/18/24
Tentative Ruling Re: Motion to Compel Anti-SLAPP Discovery, p. 4.)
 
The second prong is unsatisfied.
 
Accordingly, on the current record, the Court finds that Camacho’s
and Coalition’s motions should be granted.
