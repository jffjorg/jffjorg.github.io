```

The tentative ruling concludes that:

1. The demurrer should be sustained due to the untimeliness of the Attorney General's claims.
2. The Complaint fails to identify a specific overcharge within the last four years.
3. The last-overt-act rule applies to the Complaint, which means that the statute of limitations has not yet accrued.
4. The equitable exceptions do not apply to the Complaint.
5. The Attorney General's own chart undermines his position, and the Complaint needs to be amended to address this discrepancy.
