BACKGROUND
 
Plaintiffs
Manuel Rangel Quintero and Miriam Mayoral Hernandez
(collectively, “Plaintiffs”) filed this Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty
Act (“Song-Beverly Act”) lawsuit over alleged defects in their 2018 Honda
Odyssey with VIN: 5FNRL6H74JB103086 (the “Subject Vehicle”), which was
manufactured by Defendant American Honda Motor Co.,
Inc. (“Defendant” or “AHM”) Plaintiffs purchased the Subject Vehicle on August
30, 2021, entering into an express warranty agreement with AHM. (Compl. ¶¶
8-9.)
 
On January 13, 2023, Plaintiffs initiated the action against
AHM and Does 1 through 10. The Complaint alleges two causes of action: (1)
Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty, and (2) Fraudulent
Inducement – Concealment.
 
On June 29, 2023, the Court sustained AHM’s demurrer with 30
days to amend as to the Complaint’s second cause of action and granted AHM’s
motion to strike any claim for punitive damages in the Complaint’s first cause
of action. (6/29/23 Minute Order.)
 
On August 10, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their operative First
Amended Complaint (“FAC”), alleging against AHM and Does 1 through 10: (1)
Violation of Song-Beverly Act – Breach of Express Warranty; and (2) Fraudulent
Inducement – Concealment. 
 
Subsequently, on January 24, 2024, the Court sustained
without leave to amend AHM’s second demurrer, filed on September 14, 2023, to
the FAC’s second cause of action. The Court further granted AHM’s motion to
strike Plaintiffs’ request for punitive damages in the FAC. (1/24/24 Minute
Order.) Following this, on February 23, 2024, AHM filed its Answer to the FAC.
 
            On
September 23, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion to compel deposition
attendance of AHM’s person most qualified and custodian of records. (9/23/24
Minute Order.)
 
            On October
23, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion to Compel Compliance (the
“Motion”) Subsequently, AHM filed its Opposition to the Motion on December 9,
2024, and Plaintiffs replied on December 13, 2024.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, a court is authorized to impose
monetary sanctions, issue sanctions, evidence sanctions, or terminate sanctions
against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subds. (a), (b), (c), and (d).)
 
Misuse of the discovery process includes failure to respond
to an authorized method of discovery or disobeying a court order to provide
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010(d), (g).) 
 
Furthermore,
Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, subdivision (i) provides, in
pertinent part, “If a party then fails to obey the order compelling a response,
the court may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an
issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction.... In lieu of
or in addition to this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction.” 
 
A.   
Compel AHM’s
Compliance with the Court’s September 23, 2024, Order
 
The Court’s Order dated September 23, 2024, ordered AHM to
produce its Person Most Qualified (“PMQ”) for deposition within 30 days and AHM
and its attorney of record are ordered to jointly and severally pay $1,350.00
to Plaintiffs’ counsel. (9/23/24 Minute Order.)
 
Plaintiffs assert that even after being ordered to
cooperate, AHM ignored four of Plaintiffs’ emails and refused to produce its
witness or pay the monetary sanctions. (Mot. at p. 2, Nandivada Decl. ¶¶ 6-9.)
 
In Opposition, AHM contends that it attempted to find a date
for the deposition within the allotted 30-day time period. However, when it was
unable to do so, AHM advised Plaintiffs on November 5, 2024, through a
Cross-Notice informing Plaintiffs that a deposition of AHM’s PMQ was occurring
on November 20, 2024. (Shabani Decl. ¶ 6, Ex. “B.”) AHM asserts, that,
Plaintiffs, however, elected not to appear at the cross-notice deposition. (Opp’n.
at p. 3.)
 
In Reply, Plaintiffs argue that the Cross-Notice relied upon
by AHM was sent two weeks after the filing of the instant Motion, and the
deposition pertained to an unrelated case with different causes of action, involving
a vehicle of a different year, make, and model than the Subject Vehicle.
(Reply, at p. 1.) Additionally, Plaintiffs’ counsel was unavailable to take the
deposition of AHM’s PMQ on November 20, 2024, which was roughly a month after
the 30-day time limit expired. (Ibid.)
 
            The Court
notes that it is undisputed that AHM did not produce its PMQ within the
timeframe directed in the Court’s September 23, 2024, Order. Notably, although
AHM claims that its failure to comply with the Court’s Order was due to the
unavailability of its PMQ, it provides no explanation as to why it remained
silent on four occasions when Plaintiffs reached out to urge its compliance.
Nor did AHM present evidence of cooperation with Plaintiffs in scheduling a
mutually agreeable date for the deposition. Furthermore, AHM has failed to explain
its noncompliance with the monetary sanctions ordered in the Court’s September
23, 2024, Order.
 
            Accordingly,
the Court finds Plaintiffs’ argument persuasive, concluding that Plaintiffs
have sufficiently demonstrated that AHM misused the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010(d),
(g).)              
 
            Based
on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Motion to Compel AHM’s compliance with
the Court’s September 23, 2024, Order.
 
B.     Monetary
Sanctions
 
Monetary sanctions may be imposed “ordering that one
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that
conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct…unless [the Court] finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
 
Plaintiffs seek monetary
sanctions in the amount of $2,685.00 for attorneys’ fees and costs in bringing
this motion. (Nandivada Decl. ¶ 10.)
 
The Court finds monetary
sanctions against AHM are justified. Utilizing the lodestar approach, the Court determines the
total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and costs incurred for the work
performed in connection with the Motion to be $2,310.00, calculated based on a
reasonable hourly rate of $375.00 for six hours of work reasonably spent, plus
a $60.00 filing fee.
 
            Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ request for
monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
