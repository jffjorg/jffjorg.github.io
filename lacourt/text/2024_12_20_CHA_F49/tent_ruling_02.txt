TENTATIVE
RULING: The

BACKGROUND
 
This action stems from alleged fraud by joint venture
partners.   
 
On March 8, 2023, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant James Hoseini
(“Hoseini”) initiated this action against Defendants Reza Abad, Aiden Bohlouli (“Bohlouli”), Teza Products, Inc.
(collectively, “Defendants”), and Does 1-50. Subsequently, on March 20, 2023, Hoseini
filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against all Defendants,
alleging the following causes of action: (1) fraud, (2) breach of written
contract, (3) breach of fiduciary duty, (4) elder abuse, (5) accounting, and
(6) constructive trust. Subsequently, on April 24, 2023, Defendants filed their
Answer to the FAC. 
 
On the same day, April 24, 2023, Defendants filed their
Cross-Complaint against Hoseini and Roes 1 to 20, which was subsequently
amended on September 1, 2023, to join Teza Doors, Inc., as an additional
Cross-Complainant. This operative First Amended Cross-Complaint (“FACC”) alleges
the following causes of action: (1) fraud, (2) conversion, (3) constructive
trust, and (4) permanent injunction.
 
On June 17, 2024, the Court granted Bohlouli’s Motion to
Compel Plaintiff Hoseini’s Responses to Requests for Production of Documents
(“RFP”), Set Two. (6/17/24 Minute Order.)
 
Subsequently, on October 21, 2024, the Court granted Bohlouli’s
Motion to Compel Plaintiff’s Compliance with the Court’s June 17, 2024, Order.
(10/21/24 Minute Order.)
 
On November 25, 2024, Bohlouli filed the instant Motion for an Order
Imposing Terminating, Issue and/or Evidentiary Sanctions against Plaintiff for
failure to comply with the Court’s June 17 and October 21, 2024, orders.
Subsequently, Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Hoseini filed an Opposition on December
5, 2024, and Bohlouli replied on December 13, 2024.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
“If a
party then fails to obey the order compelling a response, the court may make
those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an
evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction.... In lieu of or in addition to
this sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction.” (Code Civ. Procs., §
2031.310, subd. (i).)
A.   
Meet and
Confer
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Bohlouli brings this Motion under the authority of Code of Civil Procedure
section 2031.310, subdivision (i). While a meet and confer process is not
explicitly required for this type of Motion, the Court finds that Bohlouli has
demonstrated good faith efforts to informally resolve the issues prior to the
filing of the Motion. (11/24/24 Cohen Decl. ¶¶ 21-22.)
 
B.    
Compel
Compliance with the Court’s October 21, 2024, Order
Misuse of the discovery process includes failure to respond
to an authorized method of discovery or disobeying a court order to provide
discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010(d), (g).) “If a party then fails to obey the
order compelling a response, the court may make those orders that are just,
including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a
terminating sanction.... In lieu of or in addition to this sanction, the court
may impose a monetary sanction.” (Code Civ. Procs., § 2031.310, subd. (i).)
 
            Here, Bohlouli
asserts that despite the Court’s October 21, 2024, Order compelling Plaintiff
to comply with its June 17, 2024 Order, and to provide verified, code-compliant
responses to the Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two, Plaintiff has still
failed to serve such responses or produce any additional documents. (11/24/24
Cohen Decl. ¶ 22.) Moreover, the Court’s October 21, 2024 Order imposed
monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,264.50 to be paid by Plaintiff within 20
days of the ruling; however, Bohlouli’s counsel received a notification from
Bank of America on November 27, 2024 that Plaintiff’s check for the monetary
sanctions had bounced due to insufficient funds to cover the check. (12/12/24
Cohen Decl. ¶ 7.)
 
            In
his Opposition, Plaintiff claims to have provided adequate responses. (Opp’n.
at p. 3.) However, Plaintiff does not specify when these “verified,
code-compliant responses,” as directed in the Court’s October 21, 2024, Order,
were allegedly produced. Nor does Plaintiff provide any evidence of additional
production of documents following the Court’s October 21, 2024, Order. Instead,
the Court finds that Plaintiff’s Opposition attempts to reargue the merits already
addressed in the October 21, 2024, Order, rendering it nonresponsive to the
issues raised in the instant Motion.
 
The Court concludes that
Defendant/Cross-Complainant Bohlouli has sufficiently demonstrated that
Plaintiff misused the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010(d), (g).)      
 
            Based
on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the Motion as to compel Plaintiff Hoseini’s
compliance with the Court’s October 21, 2024, Order. Specifically, Plaintiff
Hoseini is ordered to produce verified, code-compliant responses to Defendant
Bohlouli’s Requests for Production of Documents, Set Two, without objection,
within 10 days. Plaintiff Hoseini shall pay $1,264.50 as directed in the
October 21, 2024, Order to Defendant Bohlouli’s counsel of record.
 
C.    Monetary
Sanctions
 
Monetary sanctions may be imposed “ordering that one
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that
conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees,
incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct…unless [the Court] finds that
the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (Code of Civ.
Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
 
Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Bohlouli seeks monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,230.00 for attorneys’
fees and costs in bringing this motion. (Mot. at p. 9.)
 
The Courts finds monetary
sanctions against Plaintiff Hoseini are justified to cover the reasonable
expenses, including attorney’s fees and costs associated with the instant
Motion.
 
            Utilizing the lodestar approach,
the Court determines the total and reasonable amount of attorney’s fees and
costs incurred for the work performed in connection with the Motion to be
$2,908.00, calculated based on a reasonable hourly rate of $400.00 for seven
hours of work reasonably spent, plus a $108.00 filing fee. (11/24/24 Cohen
Decl. ¶ 23.)
 
            Accordingly, Bohlouli’s request for
monetary sanctions is GRANTED IN PART.
 
D.   
Terminating,
Issue, and/or Evidentiary Sanctions
 
As to evidence sanctions,
subdivision (c) of Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 provides:
“The court may impose an evidence sanction by an order prohibiting any party
engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from introducing designated
matters in evidence.”
 
In more extreme cases, “[t]he court may impose a
terminating sanction by one of the following orders: [¶] (1) An order striking
out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse
of the discovery process. [¶] (2) An order staying further proceedings by that
party until an order for discovery is obeyed. [¶] (3) An order dismissing the
action, or any part of the action, of that party. [¶] (4) An order rendering a
judgment by default against that party.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(d).) The
court should look to the totality of the circumstances in determining whether
terminating sanctions are appropriate.  (Lang
v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.)  Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified
where there is a willful discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and
evidence showing that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with
discovery rules.  (Van Sickle v.
Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1516.)  “[A] penalty as severe as dismissal or
default is not authorized where noncompliance with discovery is caused by an
inability to comply rather than willfulness or bad faith.”  (Brown v. Sup. Ct. (1986) 180
Cal.App.3d 701, 707.)  “Although
in extreme cases a court has the authority to order a terminating sanction as a
first measure [citations], a terminating sanction should generally not be
imposed until the court has attempted less severe alternatives and found them
to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly shows lesser sanctions would be
ineffective.”  (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566,
604-605.)
            
Here, Bohlouli requests the Court
impose a terminating sanction of Plaintiff’s refusal to comply with the Court’s
June 17 and October 21, 2024, Orders. (Mot. at p. 6.) Bohlouli further claims,
by way of example, that the Court can impose evidence sanctions excluding all
evidence and testimony regarding Plaintiff’s alleged Joint Venture
Agreement.  (Ibid.)
 
While Plaintiff’s failure to comply with discovery orders
raises serious concerns, the Court finds that the record does not establish
that less severe alternatives would be inadequate or ineffective. Consequently, the imposition of
a terminating sanction is unwarranted at this time, as such a remedy is
reserved for the most egregious circumstances. (See Laguna Auto Body v. Farmers Ins. Exchange (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 481, 488, disapproved on another ground, [“The trial court
cannot impose sanctions for misuse of the discovery process as a punishment”]; see also, Mileikowsky
v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279–280 [“A decision to order terminating
sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.”])
 
Additionally, Bohlouli
requests unspecified issue sanctions, suggesting that the forgery of the
alleged Joint Venture Agreement should be deemed as established. (Mot. at pp.
7-8.) 
 
Under the heading “Good Cause
Existed for the Discovery,” Bohlouli contends that Plaintiff produced a copy of
the Joint Venture Agreement with a signature page that differs from the version
attached to Plaintiff’s FAC. (Mot. at p. 8.) Bohlouli argues that Plaintiff’s
failure to comply with the Court’s Order has prejudiced his ability to obtain the
discovery necessary to prove a defense that the alleged Joint Venture Agreement
is forged and was never signed.  (Mot. at
p. 7.) Furthermore, Bohlouli cites text messages previously produced by
Plaintiff, which allegedly show Plaintiff instructing his prior counsel to
“make revisions to the Joint Venture Agreement, including changing the page
numbering[.]” (Mot. at p. 8.)
 
            The Court acknowledges
the discrepancies between two copies of the Joint Venture Agreement. However, the
Court is not persuaded that the text messages relied upon by Bohlouli sufficiently
establish forgery. The cited text messages appear to address inconsistencies in
pagination related to the attachment to the FAC, rather than changes to the
substantive contents of the document. Moreover, the produced text messages lack
full context, as several portions of the conversation have been redacted. (See
Cohen Decl. Ex. “5(b).”)
 
As a result, the Court finds that while discrepancies exist,
and issue sanctions deeming forgery as established are not warranted based on
the current record. Therefore, the Court declines to impose the extraordinary
remedy of issue sanctions at this time.
 
            Accordingly,
the Court DENIES the Motion as to the Request for Terminating, Evidence, and/or
Issue Sanctions.

Aiden Bohlouli’s Motion for an Order Imposing Terminating,
