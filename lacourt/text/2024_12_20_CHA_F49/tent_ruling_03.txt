MOTION FOR RECOVERY OF
ANTI-SLAPP ATTORNEY’S FEES AND COSTS

Los Angeles Superior
Court Case No. 23CHCV01957

 
Motion
filed: 8/7/24
 
MOVING PARTY: Defendants Jerald Baker and Sheila
Baker 
RESPONDING PARTY: None.
NOTICE: OK.¿¿¿ 
 
RELIEF
REQUESTED: An
order from this Court to award attorney’s fees and costs in the sum of $94,000
in favor of Defendants pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16.
 
TENTATIVE
RULING: The
motion is GRANTED with a reduced award.
 
BACKGROUND
 
This action stems from allegations by Plaintiff Taylor
Schwartz (“Plaintiff” or “Schwartz”), a realtor, who claims to have sustained
damages caused by alleged breach of contract by Defendants Jerald Baker and Sheila Baker (collectively, “Defendants”) to
sell their real property and by Defendants’ defamatory online statements
against her.
 
On July 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed her Complaint against
Defendants and Does 1 to 20, alleging the following causes of action: (1) Breach
of Contract, (2) Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing,
(3) Libel Per Se, and (4) Trade Libel. Subsequently, on August 18, 2023,
Defendants filed their Answer to the Complaint.
 
            On June 4, 2024, the Court granted Defendants’
special motion to strike the third and fourth causes of action of the Complaint
under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16 (Anti-SLAPP Motion). (6/4/24
Minute Order.)
 
            On August 7, 2024, Defendants filed
the instant Motion for Recovery of Anti-SLAPP Attorney’s Fees and Costs (the
“Motion”). 
 
            Subsequently, on December 13, 2024,
Defendants filed their Reply and Notice of Non-Opposition to the Motion.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Attorney’s fees in anti-SLAPP motions are determined using
the lodestar method. (Ketchum v Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.)
“Under the lodestar method, the trial court must first determine the lodestar
figure—the reasonable hours spent multiplied by the reasonable hourly
rate—based on a careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly
compensation of each attorney involved in the presentation of the case.” (Glaviano
v. Sacramento City Unified School Dist. (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 744, 751.)
 
The moving party bears the burden of proof as to
“reasonableness” of any fee claim. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd. (c)(5).)
The party seeking fees has the burden of documenting the appropriate hours
expended and hourly rates. (City of Colton v. Singletary (2012) 206
Cal.App.4th 751, 784.) This burden requires competent evidence as to the nature
and value of the services rendered. (Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182
Cal.App.3d 553, 559.) A plaintiff’s verified billing invoices are prima facie
evidence that the costs, expenses, and services listed were necessarily
incurred. (Hadley v. Krepel (1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 677, 682.)
 
The trial court has broad authority to determine the amount
of a reasonable fee. (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th
1084, 1095 (PLCM).)
 
A.   
Request for
Judicial Notice
 
Defendants request the Court
take judicial notice of the following matters:
 
1.     
Request
for Judicial Notice (“RJN”) No. 1: Defendants Jerald Baker and Sheila Baker’s
Notice of Motion and Special Motion to Strike; Memorandum of Points and
Authorities; Declarations of Jerald Baker, Sheila Baker, and Gerald L. Sauer
filed in this matter on August 31, 2023. (RJN Ex. “A.”)
 
2.     
RJN
No. 2: Plaintiff Taylor Schwartz’s Opposition to Defendants’ Motion and Special
Motion to Strike; Memorandum of Points and Authorities; Declaration of Taylor
Schwartz filed in this matter on January 3, 2024. (RJN Ex. “B.”)
 
3.     
RJN
No. 3: Defendants Jerald Baker and Sheila Baker’s Reply in Support of Special
Motion to Strike filed in this matter on January 9, 2024. (RJN Ex. “C.”)
 
4.     
RJN
No. 4: Notice of Entry of Order Continuing Hearing on Defendants’ Anti-SLAPP
Motion filed in this matter on January 10, 2024. (RJN Ex. “D.”)
 
5.     
RJN
No. 5: Notice of Ruling Re: (1) Defendants’ Special Motion to Strike and (2)
Case Management Conference filed in this matter on June 5, 2024. (RJN Ex. “E.”)
 
6.     
RJN
No. 6: Declaration of Jillian P. Harris in Support of Motion for Mandatory
Award of Attorneys’ Fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16
subdivision (c)(1) filed in Los Angeles Superior Court Case Number 23STCV20562
on February 26, 2024. (RJN Ex. “F.”)
 
7.     
RJN
No. 7: Court’s Ruling Granting Motion for Attorney Fees filed in Los Angeles
Superior Court Case Number 23STCV20562 on April 9, 2024. (RJN Ex. “G.”)
 
Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (d) permits the court
in its discretion to take judicial notice of the records of any court in this
state. Upon taking notice of court records, the court accepts as true only that
(1) they were filed and (2) the assertions therein were made; the court does
not take notice of the truth of their contents. (See Joslin v. H.A.S. Ins.
Brokerage (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374-375; see also Day v. Sharp
(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 904, 916.)
 
Accordingly, the court GRANTS Defendants’ RJN Nos. 6-7 only
to extent that the fellow courts made the findings and issued the rulings in
question. 
 
            However, the
Court need not take notice of filings within its own case record. Judicial
notice of court filings recognizes only the fact of their filing and that the
statements therein were made; the court does not take notice of their contents’
truth. (Wolf v. CDS Devo (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 903, 914-915.) The facts
of the documents’ filing and contentions are already in the case file. To take
unnecessary, redundant judicial notice would only create confusion.
 
            Therefore,
the Court DENIES Defendants’ RJN Nos. 1-5.
 
B.    
Motion for
Attorney’s Fees and Costs
 
(1)   Prevailing Party
 
“[T]he
anti-SLAPP statute does not refer to parties that have “prevail[ed]” in a
lawsuit; it refers specifically to defendants that have prevailed ‘on [the]
special motion to strike.’ (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (c)(1),
italics added.) A defendant that successfully moves to strike a plaintiff's
cause of action, whether on merits or nonmerits grounds, has ‘prevailed’ on the
motion, and therefore is entitled to attorney's fees and costs under Code of
Civil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (c). This understanding of the
scope of the anti-SLAPP's fee-shifting provision is consistent with its
apparent purpose: namely, compensating the prevailing defendant for the undue
burden of defending against litigation designed to chill the exercise of free
speech and petition rights.” (Barry v. State Bar of California (2017) 2
Cal.5th 318, 327–328 [emphasis in original].) The fact that Defendant’s motion
only challenged part of a cause of action is also permissible (see Baral v.
Schnitt (2016) 1 Cal.5th 376, 393), and the Court stated as much in its
ruling on the anti-SLAPP motion.
 
Here,
Defendants are the prevailing party on the Anti-SLAPP motion to strike the
third and fourth causes of action of the Complaint. (6/4/24 Minute Order.)
 
(2)  
Reasonableness
of Hourly Rates
 
“The
reasonable hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (PLCM,
supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1095.) “[T]he trial court has discretion to
determine the amount of reasonable fees to award based on ‘a consideration of
such factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the
experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved.’” (Frym
v. 601 Main St. LLC (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 613, 621.)
 
            Defendants seek to recover
attorney’s fees for two attorneys who worked on the Anti-SLAPP motion: (1) Mr.
Gerald L. Sauer (“Mr. Sauer”) at $1,250.00 per hour, and (2) Mr. Amir A.
Torkamani (“Mr. Torkamani”) at $1,000.00 per hour. (Mot. at p. 6.) Mr.
Torkamani declares that he is an experienced litigator and trial attorney with
over 15 years of experience. (Torkamani Decl. ¶ 4.) Mr. Sauer presents that he
is an experienced and successful civil trial attorney with over 40 years of
trial experience in both state and federal courts. (Sauer Decl. ¶ 4.) Both
counsels argue that their hourly rates are reasonable based on the current
“Laffey Matrix” while recognizing that a court should factor in “the nature of
the litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required and the
skill employed in handling the litigation, the attention given, the success of
the attorney’s efforts, his learning, his age, and his experience in the
particular type of work demanded; the intricacies and importance of the
litigation, the labor and the necessity for skilled legal training and ability
in trying the cause, and the time consumed,” citing Martino v. Denevi
(1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 553, 558. (Mot. at p. 7.)
 
            Significantly, the Court observes
that, in determining a reasonable hourly rate, courts consider the rate
prevailing in the community for similar work. (In re Tobacco Cases I (2013) 216
Cal.App.4th 570, 582.) This market rate approach has been consistently applied
in cases involving contingency fee agreements, in-house counsel, and pro bono representation.
Notably, in each of these cases, courts have declined to compel the reasonable market
rate to conform to the attorney’s individual rate as specified in the fee
arrangement with the prevailing party. (See Persson v. Smart Inventions, Inc.
(2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1172-1176 [contingency fee]; see also PLCM,
supra, 22 Cal.4th at p. 1096 [“Although
the terms of [a fee] contract may be considered, they ‘do not compel any
particular award.’”])
 
            Accordingly, consistent with the approach
outlined in established case law, the Court finds that the individual rates asserted
for Defendants’ counsels do not reflect the prevailing market rate in the
community for similar work, notwithstanding the Court’s individualized
consideration of the counsels’ qualifications, learning, age, and experience in
the particular type of work.
 
            The Court further finds that issues
presented in connection with the Anti-SLAPP Motion here are neither
particularly complex nor extraordinary, and do not necessitate specialized
skills or exceptional efforts beyond those ordinarily expected of competent
counsel. Therefore, the Court, in its discretion, determines the reasonable
hourly rate under the circumstances to be $600.00 per hour. 
 
(3)  
Reasonableness
of Hours Incurred
 
“A trial court assessing attorney fees begins with a
touchstone or lodestar figure, based on the ‘careful compilation of the time
spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney ... involved in the
presentation of the case.” (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor (2008)
165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1321.) “The reasonableness of attorney fees is within the
discretion of the trial court, to be determined from a consideration of such
factors as the nature of the litigation, the complexity of the issues, the
experience and expertise of counsel and the amount of time involved. The court
may also consider whether the amount requested is based upon unnecessary or
duplicative work.” (Wilkerson v. Sullivan (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 443,
448.)
 
            Defendants seek to recover the sum
of 89.75 hours incurred in connection with the Anti-SLAPP Motion. Specifically,
17 hours are attributable to Mr. Sauer and 72.75 hours to Mr. Torkamani. (Mot.
at p. 12, Torkamani Decl. ¶ 10, Sauer Decl. ¶ 9.)
 
            The Court finds that most of the
hours expended on the Anti-SLAPP matter are reasonable, subject to the
following adjustments: (1) a reduction of 5 hours for Mr. Torkamani for his
“[p]reparation of draft of anti-SLAPP motion, supporting declarations, proposed
order, and compilation of supporting evidence; (2) a reduction of 11 hours for
Mr. Torkamani and 2 hours for Mr. Sauer for their “[a]nticipated time for
review of opposition and drafting of reply,” and “anticipated time for
preparation for and attendance at hearing;” and (3) a reduction of 6 hours for
Mr. Torkamani for his “[r]esearch and drafting of Motion for Attorney’s Fees.” These
reductions are made based on the totality of circumstances, including the
nature of the issues, the absence of Opposition papers, and the availability of
remote appearance for the hearing. As a result, the Court reduces the total
reasonable hours to 65.75 approving 15 hours for Mr. Sauer and 50.75 hours for
Mr. Torkamani. This results in a total award of $39,450.00, calculated as
follows: $600.00/hr. x 15 hrs. + $600.00/hr. x 50.75 hrs.
 
            Based on the above, the Court GRANTS
the Motion, awarding Defendants reasonable attorney’s fees and costs in the
amount of $39,450.00.
 
CONCLUSION
 
Defendants Jerald Baker and Sheila Baker’s Motion for
Recovery of Anti-SLAPP Attorney’s Fees and Costs is GRANTED, with the award
reflecting reduced attorney’s fees and costs. 
 
The
Court awards Defendants Jerald Baker and Sheila Baker
$39,450.00 as reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.
 
Plaintiff Taylor Schwartz is ordered to pay Defendants Jerald Baker and Sheila Baker attorney’s fees and costs of
$39,450.00, jointly and severally.
