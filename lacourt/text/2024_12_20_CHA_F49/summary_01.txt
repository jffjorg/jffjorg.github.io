The judge has granted the motion to compel compliance, ordering the defendant to comply with the court's September 23, 2024, order to produce its Person Most Qualified for deposition and to pay $1,350.00 in sanctions to the plaintiffs' counsel. The judge has also granted part of the plaintiffs' request for monetary sanctions, ordering the defendant to pay $2,310.00 in sanctions to the plaintiffs' counsel. The judge found that the defendant misused the discovery process by failing to comply with the court's order and failing to pay the monetary sanctions. The judge also denied the defendant's opposition to the motion, finding that the defendant failed to demonstrate substantial justification for its non-compliance.
