Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has made a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Ford Motor Company and Puente Hills Ford to the complaint filed by Jasmin Davila. The court has overruled the demurrer to the fifth cause of action for fraudulent inducement through concealment, finding that the allegations are adequately pled. However, the court has sustained the demurrer to the sixth cause of action for negligent repair, but with leave to amend. The court has also found that the economic loss rule bars tort recovery for purely economic losses, and that the exception to this rule for negligently performed professional services contracts does not apply in this case.
