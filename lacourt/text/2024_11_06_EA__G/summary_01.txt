And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to reopen expert witness discovery. The plaintiff, Karl Schroeder, brought a negligence action against the defendants, Manohar Singh and San Dimas Animal Hospital, alleging that their examination of his dog, Allie, resulted in further injury. Schroeder's counsel failed to serve the expert witness designation on the designated exchange date, and the opposing counsel served their statement on time. The judge found that Schroeder's counsel did not meet the statutory requirements for relief and therefore denied the motion.
