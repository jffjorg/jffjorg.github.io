Ruling:                     MOTION FOR LEAVE TO COMPLETE DISCOVERY AND EXTEND MOTION
CUTOFF DATES CLOSER TO THE TRIAL DATE OR ALTERNATIVE MOTION TO EXTEND DISCOVERY
AND MOTION CUTOFF DATES TO COINCIDE WITH THE TRIAL DATE IS DENIED.
 
On April 28, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff Natalie Moore
and Defendant Melkon Chivichyan’s stipulation to extend all discovery and
motion cutoff deadlines based on the new trial date of September 23, 2024.
Thus, the present Motion for Leave to Complete Discovery and Pre-trial Motions
Closer to the Continued Trial Date or, alternatively, the Motion to Extend
Discovery and Motion Cutoff Dates to Coincide with the Trial Date which makes
the same request as the stipulation is moot and therefore denied.
