And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Corey Brown vs. EGL Properties, regarding a motion by Plaintiff's Counsel Nia Gamble to be relieved as counsel. The motion is denied due to insufficient notice and lack of information about a TLO background search used to confirm the Plaintiff's current address. The judge finds that there has been a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship, which is a proper ground for an attorney to withdraw. However, the judge concludes that the motion is denied due to the lack of proper notice and the failure to provide information about the TLO background search.
