Here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

"This tentative ruling grants State National Insurance Company's (SNIC) motion to intervene in the action on behalf of its insured, TGN Construction, Inc. SNIC seeks to intervene because TGN Construction, Inc. is a suspended corporation and cannot defend or participate in this action. SNIC meets all the factors for intervention under Code of Civil Procedure section 387. The court finds that SNIC has a direct and immediate interest in the action, and that intervention will not enlarge the scope of issues in the litigation. The court also finds that the benefits of allowing SNIC to intervene outweigh any opposition by the parties presently in the action. The request to appear at trial as "TGN Construction, Inc." rather than "State National Insurance Company, Inc." is deferred for ruling by the trial court, which may raise the issue in a motion in limine."
