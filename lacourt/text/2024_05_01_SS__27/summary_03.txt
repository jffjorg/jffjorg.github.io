And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge denies the defendant's motion for leave to complete discovery and extend motion cutoff dates, which is moot because it makes the same request as a previous stipulation granted by the court. The stipulation extended all discovery and motion cutoff deadlines based on the new trial date of September 23, 2024. The court notes that if parties intend to submit on this tentative ruling, they must send an email to the court with the subject line "SUBMIT" and include the hearing date and time, counsel's contact information, and the identity of the party submitting.
