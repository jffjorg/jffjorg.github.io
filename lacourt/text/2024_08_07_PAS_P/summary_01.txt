And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to terminate sanctions against the plaintiff, Irwin Munoz. The judge found that while the plaintiff did misuse the discovery process, it was not severe enough to warrant terminating sanctions. The judge also found that the defendant's request for terminating sanctions was excessive and denied it.

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel answers at a deposition in part and denied it in part. The judge ordered the plaintiff to answer certain deposition questions, but denied the request to compel answers to other questions that the judge found were irrelevant or harassing.

The judge also granted the defendant's request for sanctions in the amount of $3,980, which consists of 8 hours of defense counsel's time and the cost of the additional day of deposition. The judge ordered the plaintiff and his counsel to pay the sanctions within 30 days of the order.
