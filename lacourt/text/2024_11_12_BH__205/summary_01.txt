And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

This is a collections case where JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (Plaintiff) is trying to collect amounts due on a credit card account from Susan E Smith (Defendant). The Plaintiff served requests for admissions (RFAs) on July 16, 2024, but the Defendant failed to respond. Although the Plaintiff had no obligation to meet and confer with the Defendant, it wrote to inquire about the response, but did not receive a response. The court found that the Defendant waived any objections to the RFAs and granted the Plaintiff's motion to deem the RFAs admitted.
