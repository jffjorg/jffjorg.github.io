 Case
  No.:  23STCV02085 
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  September 25, 2023




QUANTGENE, INC., et al.
 
            vs.
 
SEBASTIAN DONOVAN, et al.










 
 

             Defendants’ motion for a protective order is
DENIED.
 
            On
1/31/2023, Plaintiffs Sebastian Donovan and Arconex (collectively, Plaintiffs)
filed suit against Quantgene, Inc. and Johannes Bhakdi (collectively,
Defendants), alleging: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of implied covenant
of good faith and fair dealing; (3) unjust enrichment; (4) intentional
misrepresentation; (5) negligent misrepresentation; and (6) violation of
Business and Professions Code section 17200.
 
            On
3/3/2022, Cross-Complainants Quantgene, Inc. and Johannes Bhakdi filed a
cross-complaint (XC) against Cross-Defendants Sebastian Donovan and Arconex,
alleging: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing; (3) false promise; (4) intentional misrepresentation; (5)
concealment; (6) negligent misrepresentation; (7) conversion; (8) unjust
enrichment; (9) intentional interference with contractual relations; and (10)
unfair business practices. 
 
            Now,
Defendants seek a protective order to adjourn the deposition of the person most
qualified (PMK) of Defendant Quantgene.
 
Discussion 
 
            Defendants
argue that good cause exists to adjourn the PMK deposition currently scheduled
for 8/10/23 to 9/15/2023, because Defendants’ counsel is withdrawing. They seek
to adjourn the deposition for a short period of time until after replacement
counsel has been retained and has received an opportunity to become familiar
with the case and meet with the corporate representative(s) for Quantgene Inc.
in preparation for this deposition.
 
            As
a preliminary matter, the relief being sought is moot given that this motion is
being heard on 9/25/2023, and the deposition in question was scheduled for
8/10/2023. 
 
            Second,
Defendants’ motion turns on the withdrawal of counsel, and the need for new counsel
to become acquainted with the facts of the case. However, notices of
substitution of counsel were filed on 8/25/2023. Accordingly, by the time of
this hearing, counsel will have had a month to acquaint themselves with the
facts of the case. The Court finds no good cause to delay deposition any
further.
 
            Based
on the foregoing, Defendants’ motion for a protective order is denied.
 
It is so ordered.
