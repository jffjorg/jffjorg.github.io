And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Takasugi has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Christopher Callahan vs. The Wags Club LLC. The case involves allegations of labor law violations, including failure to pay wages, provide meal and rest periods, and pay minimum wage. Plaintiff Callahan is seeking to compel further responses to discovery from Defendant Wags Club. However, Defendant argues that Plaintiff's motions are mooted by the provision of supplemental responses. The court has ordered that if Plaintiff disputes this, they must contact Department 17 to schedule an informal discovery conference (IDC) before the motions can be heard on the merits. The court also notes that parties must participate in an IDC before discovery motions can be considered. If all parties submit on the tentative, the court will adopt it as the final order.
