```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendants' motion for a protective order to adjourn the deposition of the person most qualified (PMK) of Defendant Quantgene. The defendants argued that good cause exists to adjourn the deposition due to the withdrawal of their counsel and the need for new counsel to become familiar with the case. However, the notice of substitution of counsel was filed on August 25, 2023, and the deposition is scheduled to take place on August 10, 2023, which is before the new counsel has had an opportunity to acquaint themselves with the facts of the case. The judge finds no good cause to delay the deposition any further.
