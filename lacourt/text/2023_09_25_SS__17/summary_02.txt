The judge denies the defendants' motion for a protective order to adjourn the deposition of the person most qualified (PMK) of Defendant Quantgene.

However, the notice of substitution of counsel was filed on August 25, 2023, and the deposition is scheduled to take place on August 10, 2023, which is before the new counsel has had an opportunity to acquaint themselves with the facts of the case. The judge finds no good cause to delay the deposition any further.

## English Summary:

The Judge denied Defendants' motion for a protective order to delay the deposition of their corporate representative, Quantgene, Inc.'s "person most qualified" (PMK). 

Defendants argued that new counsel needed time to familiarize themselves with the case before the deposition, originally scheduled for August 10, 2023. However, the Judge found this argument moot as the hearing occurred on September 25, 2023, and new counsel had been retained and filed a notice of substitution on August 25, 2023, giving them a month to prepare.
