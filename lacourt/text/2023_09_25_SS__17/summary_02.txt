Defendants argued that new counsel needed time to familiarize themselves with the case before the deposition, originally scheduled for August 10, 2023. However, the Judge found this argument moot as the hearing occurred on September 25, 2023, and new counsel had been retained and filed a notice of substitution on August 25, 2023, giving them a month to prepare.

The summary displayed below was created by an LLM named:  "mixtral-8x7b-32768":
**Case Number:** 23STCV02085

**Plaintiff:** Sebastian Donovan, Arconex

**Defendant:** Quantgene, Inc., Johannes Bhakdi

**Hearing Date:** September 25, 2023

**Department:** 17, Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles

---

On January 31, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against Defendants, alleging breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment, intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200. Cross-Complainants Quantgene, Inc. and Johannes Bhakdi filed a cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Sebastian Donovan and Arconex, alleging various claims including breach of contract, false promise, and intentional interference with contractual relations.

Defendants have sought a protective order to adjourn the deposition of the person most qualified (PMK) of Defendant Quantgene, initially scheduled for August 10, 2023, to September 15, 2023. The reason for the adjournment is the withdrawal of Defendants' counsel and the need for new counsel to become familiar with the case. However, notices of substitution of counsel were filed on August 25, 2023, providing sufficient time for new counsel to become acquainted with the facts of the case.

Judge Jon R. Takasugi has denied Defendants' motion for a protective order, finding no good cause to delay the deposition.
