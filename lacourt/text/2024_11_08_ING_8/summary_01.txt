And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the motions filed by Plaintiff Steven J. Saporito and has granted all of the motions. The motions were to compel Defendant William J. Martin's responses to discovery requests, including requests for production of documents and requests for admission. The court has also granted Plaintiff's motion to deem the requests for admission as admitted.

The court has denied Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions without prejudice, meaning that Plaintiff can re-file the request if Defendant fails to comply with the court's orders.

Defendant has failed to respond to discovery requests, which waives all objections and requires Defendant to respond to the requests. The court has noted that Defendant's failure to respond is a misuse of the discovery process and that Defendant may face further sanctions if they fail to comply with the court's orders.
