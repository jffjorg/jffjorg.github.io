  - Lien Holder: LaToya S. Redd
Significant Statements:
  - "The court is inclined to grant the motion in order to allow the parties to posture the case for a hearing and submit admissible evidence bearing on the fact that Liberty had only previously submitted evidence of counsel's declaration stating that '[t]he insurance carrier informed Mr. Feldman that his request cannot be fulfilled because the system does not allow a single check to be payable to 7 payees.'"
  - "In the interpleader motion, Liberty asserts it fears that Anna Mezheritsky will not endorse the check herself and will not pay some or all of the lien holders."
  - "The court disagrees with Redd's opposition and grants the interpleader. This litigation must be brought to a close, the agreed settlement amount must be paid, and a mechanism for allocating the settlement amount among disputing claimants must be achieved."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Liberty Mutual Insurance's motion to file an interpleader, which is a legal procedure where a third party holds money or property that is the subject of a dispute and seeks to deposit it with the court to avoid being sued by multiple parties. In this case, Liberty Mutual Insurance is seeking to interplead the $200,000 settlement amount that was agreed upon in a mediation agreement.

The judge found that Liberty Mutual Insurance has failed to carry its burden in showing how double or multiple claims may be made against it, but has granted the interpleader motion nonetheless. The judge believes that the litigation must be brought to a close and the settlement amount must be paid, and a mechanism for allocating the settlement amount among disputing claimants must be achieved.

The judge also noted that the motion did not specifically assert that double or multiple claims would be made against the Kovich defendants, but that the assertion is implicit in the moving papers. The judge also disagreed with the opposition filed by the lien holder, LaToya S. Redd, which argued that Liberty Mutual Insurance had not brought an action against the potential claimants compelling them to interplead and litigate their several claims.
