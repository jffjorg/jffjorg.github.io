Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a motion to compel the deposition of plaintiff Jorge Vargas and the production of documents. The defendant, KIA America, Inc., argues that plaintiff has failed to appear for his properly noticed deposition and has not produced the requested documents. The court finds that defendant attempted to meet and confer with plaintiff to find an available date for deposition, but plaintiff refused to provide an alternative date until after defendant filed the motion. The court grants the motion to compel plaintiff's deposition, but denies the motion to compel the production of documents. The parties are ordered to meet and confer regarding a mutually agreeable date for the deposition.
