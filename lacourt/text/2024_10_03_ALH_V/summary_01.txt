And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion to continue the trial in a case filed by Sonja Elias against the City of Burbank. The case arises from a trip and fall incident on an uneven sidewalk in Burbank. The parties have agreed to mediate the case on November 20, 2024, and the defendant is requesting a continuance of the trial date to March 5, 2025, to allow for the mediation to take place.

The Judge finds that the defendant has shown good cause for the continuance, as a continuance would allow the parties to attempt to mediate the case and continuing the trial would not prejudice any of the parties. The Judge vacates the November 19, 2024, and November 7, 2024, Final Status conference and sets a post-mediation status conference for December 9, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.
