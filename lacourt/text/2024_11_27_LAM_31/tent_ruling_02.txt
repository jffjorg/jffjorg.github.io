MOTIOS
TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY 



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Sandra Silviera 
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant General
Motors, LLC
 
 
I.          INTRODUCTION

 
This is a Song-Beverly action.  Plaintiff Sandra Silviera (Plaintiff) purchased
a 2021 Chevrolet Bolt EV (the Vehicle). 
Plaintiff alleges defendant General Motors, LLC (GM), the manufacturer
and distributor of Vehicle, knew the Vehicle had battery defects at the time Plaintiff
made the purchase.
 
 On October 14, 2024, plaintiff
Sandra Silviera (Plaintiff) filed this motion to compel defendant to provide
further responses to Plaintiff’s Request for Production of Documents, Set One,
Nos. 17, 38-41, 56, 61-64, 67-70, 73, 74. 
Plaintiff does not seek sanctions.
 
On November 14, 2024, GM filed an opposition.
 
On November 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed a reply.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD  
 
Under Code of Civil Procedure section 2031.310, parties may
move for a further response to requests for production of documents¿where an
answer to the request is evasive or incomplete or where an objection is without
merit or too general.¿ The motion “shall set forth specific facts showing good
cause justifying the discovery sought by the inspection demand.”¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(1).)¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿ 
Notice of the motion must be given within 45 days of service
of the verified response, otherwise, the propounding party waives any right to
compel a further response.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (c).)¿ The
motion must also be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration.¿ (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2031.310, subd. (b)(2).)¿¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿¿¿ 
Finally, California Rules of Court, rule 3.1345 requires
that all motions or responses involving further discovery contain a separate
statement with the text of each request, the response, and a statement of
factual and legal reasons for compelling further responses.¿ (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1345(a)(3).)¿¿¿¿¿ 
 
III.       DISCUSSION
In her motion, Plaintiff states:¿ “Plaintiff alleges that
the Vehicle was sold to him [sic] with a defective battery that, among other
things, could catch fire. Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant was aware of
the defective battery prior to Plaintiff’s purchase and intentionally concealed
it to induce Plaintiff into purchasing a defective product. After Plaintiff
discovered the defective nature of the battery, he [sic] sought to have it repaired
pursuant the vehicle’s express warranty that accompanied the vehicle, but
Defendant failed to repair the vehicle and failed to repurchase it in willful
violation of Song-Beverly.  [¶]  To prove these allegations, Plaintiff
requested documents seeking to establish Defendant’s knowledge of the battery
defect, the extent of the defect, its cause, and Defendant’s inability to fix
it.”  (Mot., p. 1:6-13.)¿¿ 
Plaintiff now seeks a further response to Request for
Production, Nos. 17, 38-41, 56, 61-64, 67-70, 73, 74.¿ The discovery requests
fall into four general categories:  
 
(1) those relating to recalls issued, or in the process of
being issued for 2017 through 2022 model year Chevrolet Bolt vehicles (Request
No. 17); 
 
(2) those relating to complaints by owners and lessees of
2017 through 2022 model year Chevrolet Bolt vehicles (Request Nos. 38-41); 
 
(3) all documents which refer, relate to or concern the
investigations referenced in various recalls N212343880 involving “experts from
GM and LG” which identified the root cause of the battery defects in 2017
through 2022 model year Chevrolet Bolt vehicles (Request No. 56); and 
 
(4) those relating to GM’s internal investigations, analysis
and publications of battery defects plaguing the Vehicle (Request Nos. 61-74). 
 
The parties have the court’s Addendum to Case Management
Conference Order re: Song-Beverly Discovery (“Addendum”).¿ The court addresses
each production request with the Addendum in mind.¿
 
Category 1 (Request No. 17): All DOCUMENTS which refer,
relate to or concern any recalls issued, or in the process of being issued for
2017 through 2022 model year Chevrolet Bolt vehicles (this Request includes,
but is not limited to, all documents giving rise to the issuance of the recalls
and the recalls themselves).
 
Court’s Ruling:
DENIED. The language “refer, relate to or concern any recalls issued, or in the
process of being issued for 2017 through 2022 model year Chevrolet Bolt
vehicles” is overbroad and vague. 
 
Category 2 (Request Nos. 38-41): “those relating to
complaints by owners and lessees of 2017 through 2022 model year Chevrolet Bolt
vehicles”
 
Ruling: Request No.
38 (battery) is GRANTED in part.  Plaintiff
may obtain the documents relating to complaints by owners and lessees of vehicles
purchased in California of the same make, model, and year as the subject Vehicle
and further limited to the battery defects Plaintiff encountered with the
Vehicle. (Addendum 2(h).) 
 
Request Nos. 39 (fires), 40 (charging system), and 41 (loss
of power) are DENIED.  Irrelevant.
 
Category 3 (Request No. 56): “all documents which refer,
relate to or concern the investigations referenced in various recalls
N212343880 involving “experts from GM and LG” which identified the root cause
of the battery defects in 2017 through 2022 model year Chevrolet Bolt vehicles”
 
Ruling:  DENIED.  The request
is vague and confusing.  The request seeks
documents from investigations that involved the use of experts who may have identified
the root cause of certain battery defects. 
But it is unclear whether the request is seeking the opinions from
unidentified experts or the results of the investigations, which investigations
may have included information beyond the opinions of the experts.  To be responsive, do the investigations have
be referenced in the “various” recalls N212343880 and do those investigations have
to involve experts and do those experts then have to identify the root cause of
the battery defects?  Or are documents
responsive if the investigation identifies root causes, but the experts don’t?    
 
Category 4 (Request Nos. 61-74): “those relating to GM’s
internal investigations, analysis and publications of battery defects plaguing
the Vehicle”
 
Ruling:  GRANTED in part.  The
request is overbroad.  Plaintiff may
obtain discovery for vehicles purchased in California of the same year, make,
and model as the subject Vehicle, and further limited to the battery defects
Plaintiff encountered with the Vehicle. 
(Addendum 2(h).)  
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            The motion is Granted in Part.  Defendant General Motors, LLC is ordered to
serve a further response to Request Nos. 38, and 61-74 within 45 days of this
order.  
 
            The motion
is Denied as to Request Nos. 17 and 39-41, 56.
 
Plaintiff to give notice.
