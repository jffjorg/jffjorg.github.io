And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Keep America Safe and Beautiful, in the public interest v. Himalaya Wellness USA Limited, et al. The defendant, Himalaya, filed a demurrer to the complaint, arguing that the action is time-barred because the plaintiff knew of the alleged violations more than a year ago. The plaintiff argues that the language of the Notice of Violation does not clearly indicate the date of discovery, and that the statute of limitations for injunctive relief, which is three years, applies.

The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that even if the plaintiff discovered the violations on August 17, 2022, the action was filed within the three-year limitations period applicable to injunctive relief. The judge notes that the court need not resolve the disputes over the language of the Notice of Violation and the application of the statute of limitations to this case.

The judge has ordered the defendant to serve and file its answer to the complaint within 10 days of the order, and has given notice to the plaintiff.
