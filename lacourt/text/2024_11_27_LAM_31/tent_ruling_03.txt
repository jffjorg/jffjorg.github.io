I.          INTRODUCTION
 
On June 11, 2024, plaintiff Craig B. Forbes (Plaintiff)
filed a Verified Complaint against defendant Ronald Kishok (Defendant) for (1)
Breach of Personal Guaranty, (2) Deficiency Judgment, and (3) Quiet Title
Judgment.  Plaintiff is self-represented. 
 
As alleged in the Complaint, Defendant executed and
delivered to Plaintiff a promissory note in the principal amount of $650,000.
Pursuant to the terms of the Note, Defendant agreed to pay Plaintiff monthly
payments of $6,513.02 in exchange for a loan. 
To secure the payment, Defendant entered and delivered to Plaintiff a
security agreement granting Plaintiff a first lien mortgage or deed of trust for
the real property located at 6715 Tampa Avenue, Reseda, CA (the Property).  Defendant defaulted and refused to make the
payment due thereunder.
 
On August 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed a Proof of Service of
Summons which states he personally served Defendant on June 18, 2024.
 
On October 24, 2024, proposed intervenor Carol A. Dekkers,
successor trustee of the Kishok 1996 Living Trust, filed this motion to intervene.  
 
            The motion
is unopposed.
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD
 
“An intervention takes place when a nonparty, deemed an
intervenor, becomes a party to an action or proceeding between other persons by
doing any of the following:
 
(1) Joining a plaintiff in claiming what is sought by the
complaint.
(2) Uniting with a defendant in resisting the claims of a
plaintiff.
(3) Demanding anything adverse to both a plaintiff and a
defendant.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 387, subd. (b).) 
 
“A nonparty shall petition the court for leave to intervene
by noticed motion or ex parte application.  The petition shall include a
copy of the proposed complaint in intervention or answer in intervention and
set forth the grounds upon which intervention rests.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 387, subd. (c).)  
 
“The court shall, upon timely application, permit a nonparty
to intervene in the action or proceeding if either of the following conditions
is satisfied: 
 
(A)¿A
provision of law confers an unconditional right to intervene.
(B)¿The
person seeking intervention claims an interest relating to the property or
transaction that is the subject of the action and that person is so situated
that the disposition of the action may impair or impede that person’s ability
to protect that interest, unless that person’s interest is adequately
represented by one or more of the existing parties.”  
 
(Code
Civ. Proc. § 387, subd. (d)(1).)
 
If leave to intervene is granted by the court, the
intervenor shall separately file the complaint in intervention and serve notice
of the court’s decision to parties who have appeared. (Code Civ. Proc. § 387,
subd. (e).) 
 
III.      DISCUSSION 
 
Proposed intervenor Carol A. Dekkers (Dekkers), in her
capacity as the successor trustee of the Kishok 1996 Living Trust seeks leave
to intervene in this action.  As she
explains in her motion, Defendant executed the Kishok 1996 Living Trust in
January of 1996.  Defendant designated
himself as trustee and his niece, Monika A. Gunn (Gunn), as successor trustee,
and Dekkers as alternate successor trustee. 
On January 31, 2023, Defendant passed away.  On September 11, 2023, Gunn passed away.  Dekkers assumed her role as alternate
successor trustee thereafter.   (Dekkers
Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.)
 
In March of 2024, Dekkers initiated probate proceedings.  Her attorney informed Dekker of a suspicious
trust recorded by Plaintiff which jeopardized the original terms of the Kishok
1996 Living Trust by appointing Plaintiff as successor trustee without
mentioning the trustees identified in the Kishok 1996 Living Trust.  (Dekkers Decl., ¶ 5.)  Further, Plaintiff’s trust indicates he
obtained a $270,000 loan secured against the trust estate.  (Paley Decl., ¶ 6.) 
 
In July of 2024, Dekkers learned of this lawsuit.  She contends Plaintiff falsely claims that,
among other things, Defendant owes Plaintiff $650,000 under a promissory note, (Dekkers
Decl., ¶ 6), and that he personally served Defendant with process in June of
2024 despite Defendant having passed away in January of 2023.
 
Based on the foregoing, Dekkers argues intervention is
necessary to protect the interests of the Kishok 1996 Living Trust.  The court agrees.  Dekkers establishes a clear interest in this
litigation.  As trustee of Defendant’s Living
Trust, Dekkers is obligated to protect trust assets.  (Prob. Code, §1600.)  Indeed, as trustee, Dekkers has the right to
seek court intervention when trust assets are allegedly mishandled.  (Prob. Code, §16420.)  Further, Dekkers brought this motion soon
after learning of this lawsuit.  (See People
ex rel. Rominger v. County of Trinity (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 655.  The motion is timely.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION         
 
            The unopposed
motion is GRANTED.  Carol A. Dekkers, as
successor trustee of the Kishok 1996 Living Trust, is ordered to serve and file
her proposed Complaint-in-Intervention within five (5) court days of this
Order.  
 
            Moving
party to give notice.
