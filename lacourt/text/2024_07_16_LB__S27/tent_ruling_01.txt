b.     Analysis
i.             
Does
a presumption of fairness exist?  
Was the settlement reached through arm's-length bargaining?  Yes. The parties participated in a full-day
mediation with Daniel Buckley, Esq., and ultimately agreed to settle at the
conclusion of the session on 8/02/23.  Fawley
Declaration, ¶13. 
 
Were investigation and discovery sufficient to allow counsel and the
court to act intelligently?  Yes. Fawley provides
a detailed description of all discovery conducted at ¶14 of her declaration in
support of the motion.   
 
Is counsel experienced in similar litigation?  Yes.  Attorney
Fawley details the firm’s experience with PAGA litigation at ¶¶2-7 of her
declaration.
 
What percentage of the class has objected?  n/a
 
            CONCLUSION:  The settlement is entitled to a presumption
of fairness.
 
ii.          Is the settlement
fair, adequate, and reasonable?
Strength of Plaintiffs' case.  
1.    
"The
most important factor is the strength of the case for plaintiffs on the merits,
balanced against the amount offered in settlement."  (Kullar v. Foot Locker Retail, Inc. (2008)
168 Cal.App.4th 116, 130.)  Plaintiff
explains the strengths and weaknesses of the case at pages 14-15 of the moving
papers.  
2.   Risk,
expense, complexity and likely duration of further litigation.  Given the nature of the claim, the case is
likely to be expensive and lengthy to try. 
Procedural hurdles (e.g., motion practice and appeals) are also likely
to prolong the litigation as well as any recovery by the aggrieved employees.
3.         Risk of maintaining
class action status through trial.  n/a
4.         Amount
offered in settlement. The Settlement Amount is reasonable in light of the
risks of the case, and in light of the fact that the settlement was reached
through mediation.   
5.         Extent
of discovery completed and stage of the proceedings.  As indicated above, at the time of the
settlement, Plaintiff's Counsel had conducted sufficient discovery.
6.         Experience
and views of counsel.  The settlement was
negotiated and endorsed by Plaintiff's Counsel who, as indicated above, is
experienced in PAGA litigation.
 
            CONCLUSION:  The settlement can be deemed "fair,
adequate, and reasonable." 
 
iii.         Scope of the release 
Upon the approval by the Court of this Settlement, each PAGA Member
(including Plaintiff), shall fully release Defendant from all claims arising
out of the facts set forth in Plaintiff’s LWDA notice and complaint.  Plaintiff will also provide a general release
and CC §1542 waiver as to Defendant.  
 
iv.         Is the notice proper?
PAGA has no notice requirements for unnamed class members, nor may such
employees opt out of a PAGA actions.  See
Hernandez v. DMSI Staffing, LLC. (N.D. Cal. 2015) 79 F.Supp.3d 1054, 1063,
aff'd sub nom. Hernandez v. DMSI Staffing, LLC (9th Cir. 2017) 677 Fed. Appx.
359.  See also Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc.
(2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 56.  
 
The parties have prepared a cover letter to send to all aggrieved
employees along with their settlement share checks, which the parties ask the
Court to approve.
 
v.         Attorney fees and costs
An aggrieved employee who prevails in a PAGA action may recover
reasonable attorney's fees and costs. 
Labor Code §2699(g)(1).  Whether a
plaintiff established entitlement to an award of fees under PAGA is a question
best decided by the trial court. San Diego Municipal Employees Association v.
City of San Diego (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 906.
 
Counsel requests $760,000 in litigation fees (40% to the gross
settlement).  Per Counsel’s declaration,
this amount is fair and reasonable.  
 
Counsel requests reimbursement for costs incurred during the litigation
in the sum of $11,370.02, which is also fair and reasonable.  
 
The Court will approve all requested amounts.  
 
vi.         Representative Enhancement Award
The Settlement Agreement provides for $7500.00 for a representative
payment. Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s attorney both declare this incentive is
based on Plaintiff’s willing participation in every stage of the
litigation.  The Court also notes that
Plaintiff has agreed to a broad waiver of all future claims.  The Court finds the incentive award
reasonable.   
 
vii.        Claims Administration Costs
The Settlement Agreement provides for $8000.00 in Administration Costs
to Phoenix.  This is fair and reasonable
and in line with the normal amount sought by administrators in these cases.
 
 viii.      Conclusion
The Court finds the settlement and all requested fees and costs to be
reasonable, and the Court will grant the motion to approve the settlement.
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.
