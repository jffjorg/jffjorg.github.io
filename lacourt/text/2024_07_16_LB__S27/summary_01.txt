And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling regarding the motion for approval of a settlement agreement in a PAGA action filed by Ashton Baker against Weber Distribution, LLC and Weber Logistics. The settlement agreement was reached through mediation and provides for a payment of $1,900,000 to be distributed to approximately 1098 aggrieved employees. The settlement also requires the defendants to pay attorneys' fees, litigation expenses, and administration costs.

The judge finds that the settlement is entitled to a presumption of fairness and that it is fair, adequate, and reasonable. The judge notes that the strength of the case for the plaintiffs on the merits, balanced against the amount offered in settlement, is a key factor in determining the reasonableness of the settlement. The judge also finds that the settlement was reached through arm's-length bargaining and that the parties participated in a full-day mediation session.

The judge approves the settlement agreement and all requested fees and costs, including attorneys' fees of $760,000, litigation expenses of $11,370.02, and administration costs of $8,000. The judge also approves the representative enhancement award of $7,500 to the plaintiff and notes that the incentive payment is based on the plaintiff's willing participation in every stage of the litigation.

The judge orders the plaintiff to give notice to all parties and sets a hearing date for July 16, 2024.
