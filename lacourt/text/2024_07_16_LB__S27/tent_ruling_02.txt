 Case Number:  23LBCV00406    Hearing Date:   July 16, 2024    Dept:  S27 This is a simple automobile
accident action.  Despite that fact, the
Court previously heard a motion to compel compliance with subpoena and for an
OSC re: contempt.  Today, the Court is
scheduled to hear a motion to quash deposition subpoena for business
records.  The parties have motions to
compel further responses scheduled for 7/25/24, 8/06/24, and 8/08/24.  Additionally, the parties have a motion to
compel deposition scheduled for 10/08/24, AFTER the currently scheduled trial
date of 8/19/24.  
 
As an initial note, per CCP
§2024.020, all discovery motions must be heard at least 15 days prior to
trial.  Trial is scheduled for 8/19/24,
which means the last date the Court can hear a discovery motion is 8/04/24.  Because 8/04/24 is a Friday, the last date
for hearing on discovery motions is 8/02/24. 

 
The Court is continuing the hearing
on this motion to 7/25/24.  The Court is
also advancing the hearing on the 8/06/24 and 8/08/24 motions and continuing
them to 7/25/24.  The Court is taking no
action on the motion scheduled for 10/08/24. 
Additionally, the Court sets an OSC re: appointment of a discovery
referee for 7/25/24.  
 
The Court strongly encourages the
parties to work together between now and 7/25/24 to resolve all outstanding
discovery issues.  If the parties are
unable to do so, the Court will likely appoint a discovery referee in lieu of
ruling on the pending motions on 7/25/24. 

 
If the parties are unable to
resolve their issues, but wish to avoid appointment of a discovery referee,
they must file a joint statement of items in dispute at least four court days
prior to 7/25/24 (by the end of the day on Friday, 8/19/24).  The joint statement must list each discovery
item in dispute, the most current response to that item, and each party’s
statement of why a further response should or should not be ordered (or why the
category should or should not be quashed). 
The Court, based on the volume and complexity of the statement, will
decide whether to rule on the remaining issues or to refer the matter to a
referee.    
 
Plaintiff is ordered to give
notice.
 
Parties who intend to submit
on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department
does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the
tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed
off calendar.  If a party submits on
the tentative, the party’s email must include the case number and must identify
the party submitting on the tentative.  If
the parties do not submit on the tentative, they should arrange to appear
remotely.
