```

Here is a brief summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has sustained the defendant's demurrer with leave to amend, dismissing the elder abuse, NIED, and patients' bill of rights claims. The Judge found that the complaint failed to plead facts with specificity, particularly with regard to the three days Decedent was in the care of Moving Defendant's facility. The Judge ordered the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint within 20 days, omitting claims that cannot be pleaded with specificity. The defendant's motion to strike is moot in light of the ruling on the demurrer.
