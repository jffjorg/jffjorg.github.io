And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion for relief from waiver of objections to written discovery. The defendant, Julio Cesar Parra-Prado, failed to serve timely responses to discovery requests, but claims that the failure was due to mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect. The defendant then served code-compliant responses on November 6, 2024. The judge has reviewed the defendant's responses and finds them to be substantially code-compliant. The court has also determined that the requirements of the relevant statutes are met, and therefore grants the defendant's motion for relief from waiver of objections.
