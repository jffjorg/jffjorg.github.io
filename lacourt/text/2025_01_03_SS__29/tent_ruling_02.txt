Legal Standard
“The purpose
of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), “requires the trial judge to grant
summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of
the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the
issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether
there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.”
(Juge v. County of Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI
Development, Inc. v. Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381-382.)
As to each
cause of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary
judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by
presenting facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ...
cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra,
25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)
A plaintiff or
cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that there is
no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has
met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show
that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of
action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
The party
opposing a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not simply
“rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set
forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)
Courts
“liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
Discussion
Defendants bring this motion for summary
judgment or, in the alternative, for summary adjudication of the following
issues: (1) Defendants did not owe a duty to Plaintiff; (2) Defendants did not
breach any duty owed to Plaintiff; and (3) Defendants did not cause Plaintiff’s
injuries.  Defendants’ motion is based
(primarily) on their contention that Plaintiff admitted, in testimony and in verified
discovery responses, that the cause of the accident was the negligence or other
wrongful conduct of the driver of the Lyft vehicle in which Plaintiff was riding,
and that nothing that Defendants did or failed to do caused, contributed to, or
was a substantial factor in bringing about the accident.
Plaintiff opposes the motion, but the
opposition was filed late by one court day. 
The Court has considered the arguments on both sides and exercises its discretion
to consider the late filed opposition, particularly given the importance of
this motion and the relatively minor delay in the filing.  In addition, as set forth below, the Court is
continuing the hearing and allowing supplemental filings, which will
substantially cure any prejudice to Defendants as moving parties.
Plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing (in part)
that there is evidence that Defendant Braxton caused or contributed to the
accident.  In connection with Plaintiff’s
opposition, counsel submits a declaration stating (among other things) that counsel
for Defendant Lyft has advised that Lyft has a written statement or report from
Patrick DiTomaso (the other passenger in the Lyft at the time of the accident) in
which Mr. DiTomaso states that Defendant Braxton was wholly or partially at
fault.  (Daniels Decl., ¶ 11.)  Plaintiff recently served Mr. DiTomaso with a
deposition subpoena, and the deposition is scheduled for January 30, 2025.  (Id., ¶ 15.) 
Plaintiff seeks a continuance of the motion so that this evidence may be
obtained.
Code of Civil
Procedure section 437c, subdivision (h), contains an express statutory
provision for a continuance of a summary judgment motion hearing. That
subdivision provides, in pertinent part:
“If
it appears from the affidavits submitted in opposition to a motion for summary
judgment or summary adjudication, or both, that facts essential to justify
opposition may exist but cannot, for reasons stated, be presented, the court
shall deny the motion, order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained
or discovery to be had, or make any other order as may be just.” 
In addition, even
when the requirements of subdivision (h) are not satisfied, the Court still has
the inherent authority, in its discretion, to grant a request for a
continuance, even an oral request for a continuance at the hearing, for good
cause shown.  (See Chavez v. 24 Hour
Fitness USA (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 632, 643-644; Lerma v. County of
Orange (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 709, 716.) 
In deciding whether
to continue a hearing on a motion for summary judgment pursuant to this
inherent authority, a court may consider a variety of factors, including: “(1)
how long the case has been pending; (2) how long the requesting party had to
oppose the motion; (3) whether the continuance motion could have been made
earlier; (4) the proximity of the trial date or the 30-day discovery cutoff
before trial; (5) any prior continuances for the same reason; and (6) the
question whether the evidence sought is truly essential to the motion.”  (Chavez, supra, 238 Cal. App.4th at p.
644; see also 3 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (2024), ¶¶ 10:208-208.2.) 
Given the high stakes involved in a summary judgment motion, a request
to continue the hearing should not be denied “without good reason.”  (Denton v. City and County of San Francisco
(2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 779 , 794; Frazee v. Seely (2002) 95
Cal.App.4th 627, 634.)
The Court has considered the arguments of both
sides and grants Plaintiff’s request to continue, on both statutory and
nonstatutory grounds.  The evidence appears
truly essential to the motion, and Plaintiff has provided a sufficient
explanation as to why it was not obtained earlier.  In addition, it does not appear that a
continuance will interfere with the trial schedule.  
Conclusion
The Court CONTINUES the hearing on the motion
for summary judgment filed by Defendants for approximately 60 days.
The parties may file supplemental oppositions
and replies pursuant to code with reference to the new hearing date.
Moving
Party is to give notice.
