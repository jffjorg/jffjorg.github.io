23STCV30538
Defendant’s Motion for Relief from Waiver of Objections to Written Discovery 
 
Tentative
 
The motion is granted.
 
Background
On December 14, 2023, Ricardo Rivera and Curt Weber filed
a complaint against Julio Cesar Parra-Prado (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 10,
asserting two cause of action for negligence (one on behalf of each plaintiff) arising
out of an automobile accident occurring on November 23, 2023.
 
On March 4, 2024, Plaintiff Ricardo Rivera filed a request
for dismissal of the cause of action on his behalf in the complaint. 
 
On April 3, 2024, Defendant filed an answer.
 
On November 6, 2024, Defendant filed this motion for
relief from waiver of objections to written discovery. 
 
No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
A party to whom
interrogatories are propounded waives his right to object to the requests if he
failed to serve a timely response. However, a party may be relieved of that
waiver if “(1) The party has subsequently served a response that is in
substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and
2030.240. (2) The plaintiff’s failure to serve a timely response was the result
of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., section
2030.290.)¿There are substantially similar sections pertaining to relief from
waiver of objections for requests for admission and requests for production.
(Code Civ. Proc., sections 2033.280, 2031.300.)¿¿ 
 
The Court of Appeal has
directed that the statutory language “mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect” in the discovery statute should be interpreted using the same general
principles developed in application of the identical language in section 473,
subdivision (b). (Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1997) 59
Cal.App.4th 263, 275.) Although the party moving for relief under section 473
has the burden to show that the mistake, inadvertence, or neglect was
excusable, any doubts as to that showing must be resolved in favor of the
moving party. (New Albertsons, Inc. v. Superior Court (2008) 168
Cal.App.4th 1403, 1420.)¿¿ 
 
The courts have ruled that
substantial compliance is dependent on the meaning and purpose of the statute.
(Freeman v. Vista de Santa Barbara Associates LP (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th
791, 793.) For example, a proposed response to requests for admission are
substantially compliant where the responses were verified, contained responses
to a majority of responses, and were served before the hearing on a motion to
compel. (St. Mary v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 762, 782.)
Such responses may not have complied with all statutory requirements, but
constituted facially good-faith efforts to respond to the requests for
admissions that is substantially code compliant. (Ibid.)
 
Discussion
 
Defendant seeks an order
granting relief from the waiver of objections to interrogatories, requests for
production, and requests for admission. Defendant contends the failure to serve
timely responses was due to mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect. 
 
The failure to respond to
discovery requests in a timely manner generally results in the waiver of all
objections.  A party may bring a motion for
relief from that waiver as to interrogatories if “(1) The party has
subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections
2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. (2) The plaintiff’s failure to
serve a timely response was the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect.” (Code Civ. Proc., section 2030.290.) Similar provisions in the Civil
Discovery Act apply to requests for admission and requests for production.
(Code Civ. Proc., sections 2033.280, 2031.300.)¿¿ 
 
Defendant was served with
discovery on September 17, 2024, but due to attorney mistake, the response
deadline was not calendared. (Boyd Decl., ¶¶ 3, 4.) Defendant served
code-compliant responses on November 6, 2024. (Id., ¶ 6.) 
 
The Court has reviewed Defendant’s
untimely responses and finds them to be substantially code-complaint. (See Exh.
C.)
 
Defendant has served
substantially compliant discovery responses and has shown that the failure to
serve a timely response was the result of mistake.  The Court finds the requirements of Code of
Civil Procedure sections 2030.290, 2033.280, and 2031.300 are met.
 
Accordingly, the Court GRANTS
Defendant’s motion for waiver of objections.
 
Conclusion
The
Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion for relief from waiver of objections to written
discovery.
Moving
party is ORDERED to give notice.
