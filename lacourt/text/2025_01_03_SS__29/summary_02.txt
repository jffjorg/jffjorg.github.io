  - "Courts liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party."
  - "The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings."
  - "The Court has the inherent authority, in its discretion, to grant a request for a continuance, even an oral request for a continuance at the hearing, for good cause shown."

Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has decided to continue the hearing on the motion for summary judgment filed by Ericka Braxton and Tumbleweed Educational Enterprises, Inc. The motion is based on the defendants' contention that the plaintiff, Patrick Suzor, admitted that the cause of the accident was the negligence or other wrongful conduct of the driver of the Lyft vehicle in which Suzor was riding. Suzor opposes the motion, arguing that there is evidence that Braxton caused or contributed to the accident. The judge has decided to continue the hearing for approximately 60 days to allow Suzor to obtain additional evidence, specifically a deposition from a witness who claims that Braxton was partially at fault. The judge has also granted Suzor's request to file a supplemental opposition to the motion.
