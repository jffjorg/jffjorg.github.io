And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion to compel the deposition of the plaintiff and a physical examination of the plaintiff. The motion is denied on procedural grounds because the defendants have combined two separate requests for relief into one motion. The judge finds that this is procedurally improper and that the defendants must file separate motions for each request, reserving separate hearing dates and paying separate filing fees. The motion is denied without prejudice, meaning that the defendants may refile their motion in the proper form. The judge has instructed the moving party to give notice of the ruling.
