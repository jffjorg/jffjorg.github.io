 Case Number:  23STCV08638    Hearing Date:   January 3, 2025    Dept:  29 Ball v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority
23STCV08638
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel filed by Plaintiff’s Counsel Tom Vertanous.
 
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice.
Background
On April 18, 2023, George Ball (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority (“LACMTA”) for government employee negligence and general negligence arising
out of an incident in which Plaintiff alleges that he was struck by the
handicap ramp while boarding a bus on May 13, 2022.
On May 10, 2023, LACMTA filed an answer.
On December 12, 2024, Tom Vertanous (“Counsel”)
filed this motion to be relieved as counsel. 
No opposition has been filed. 
Legal
Standard
The court may order that an attorney be changed or
substituted at any time before or after judgment or final determination upon
request by either client or attorney and after notice from one to the other.
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 284(b).) An attorney is permitted to withdraw where
conflicts between the attorney and client make it unreasonable to continue the
representation. (See Cal. Rules of Prof. Conduct 3-700(C)(1).) “The
determination whether to grant or deny a motion to withdraw as counsel lies
within the sound discretion of the trial court.” (Manfredi & Levine v.
Superior Court (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1133.)   
 
An application to be relieved as counsel must be made on
Judicial Counsel Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion) (Cal. Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362(a)), MC-052 (Declaration) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.136(c)), and MC-053 (Proposed Order) (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1362(e)).   
 
Further, the requisite forms must be served on the client
and all other parties who have appeared in the case. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362(d).) The court may delay effective date of the order relieving
counsel until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has
been filed with the court. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(e).) 
 
Discussion
 
Counsel has filed
the Notice, Declaration, declaration of Counsel, and Order to be relieved as
counsel for Plaintiff. 
 
The Court finds that
service was not timely.  A motion must be
served 16 court days prior to the hearing, plus five additional days for
service by mail.  That means that for a
hearing on January 3, 2025, the motion must be served by mail no later than
December 5, 2024.  But here, Counsel
served the motion by mail on December 11, 2024.
 
Further, the
only proof of service filed was for the declaration of Counsel; no proof of
service (on either Plaintiff or LACMTA) was filed as to the other documents in
support of the motion.
 
Additionally, item
2 on form MC-052 does not properly describe the reasons for the motion. 
 
Accordingly, the
motion is DENIED without prejudice.
Conclusion
The motion to be
relieved as counsel is DENIED without prejudice.
