Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Los Angeles has requested a continuance of the trial currently set for February 3, 2025, in order to hear its motion for summary judgment. The City argues that it has a right to have its timely filed and served motion heard before trial, and that the court has the discretion to grant continuances for good cause shown. The court has considered the facts and circumstances relevant to the determination and has found that the City has shown good cause for the continuance. The motion is therefore granted, and the trial will be continued to a date on or after July 29, 2025.
