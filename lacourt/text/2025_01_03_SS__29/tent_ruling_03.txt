Background
On July 15, 2022, Jeffrey L. O’Malley (“Plaintiff”) filed
a complaint against Special Service For Groups, Inc., Homeless Outreach Program
Integrated Care System, County of Los Angeles Board of Supervisors, Housing 1
by 1, Inc., Cassandra Brown, Sheena Williams, Nancy J. Howland, The Nancy J.
Howland Family Trust, Phillip Ray Olson, the Phillip Ray Olson Trust, and Does
1 through 100, asserting a cause of action for negligence based on an incident in
which Plaintiff alleges that he was injured when Defendant Brown poured
scalding hot water on him.
 
On November 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed an amendment to
complaint adding Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority as Doe 1.
 
On February 5, 2024, Special Service
For Groups, Inc. (“Defendant”) filed a demurrer. Plaintiff did not oppose the
demurrer or appear at the hearing.  On
March 15, 2024, the Court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.  Judgment was entered in favor of Defendant.
 
On August 22, 2024, the Court granted
the motion of Plaintiff to set aside the judgment and granted Plaintiff leave
to amend.
 
On September 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed
a First Amended Complaint (“FAC”). In the FAC, Plaintiff now asserts one cause
of action for negligence and one cause of action for vicarious liability/respondeat
superior.  
 
On October 28, 2024, Defendant filed this demurrer and
motion to strike. Plaintiff filed oppositions on December 10, and Defendant
filed replies on December 26.
 
In addition, on November 22, 2024. Defendant filed a
motion for attorney’s fees relating to the Court’s order setting aside the
judgment.  Plaintiff filed an opposition
on December 19, and Defendant filed a reply on December 26.
 
Legal
Standard
Demurrer
Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10 provides:
“The party against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been
filed may object, by demurrer or answer as provided in Section 430.30, to the
pleading on any one or more of the following grounds:
(a) The court has no jurisdiction of the subject of the
cause of action alleged in the pleading.
(b) The person who filed the pleading does not have the
legal capacity to sue.
(c) There is another action pending between the same
parties on the same cause of action.
(d) There is a defect or misjoinder of parties.
(e) The pleading does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a cause of action.
(f) The pleading is uncertain. As used in this subdivision,
“uncertain” includes ambiguous and unintelligible.
(g) In an action founded upon a contract, it cannot be
ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is
implied by conduct.
(h) No certificate was filed as required by Section 411.35.”
A
general demurrer under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10, subdivision (e),
tests whether the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740,
747; see also 1 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial [2024], ¶ 7:40.)
“We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts
properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or
law.  We also consider matters which may
be judicially noticed.”  (Centinela
Freeman Emergency Medical Associates v. Health Net of California (2016) 1
Cal.5th 994, 1010; Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; accord Yvanova
v. New Century Mortgage Corp. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 919, 924; Marina Pacific
Hotel and Suites v. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company (2022) 81 Cal.App.5th
96, 104.)  All reasonable inferences must
be drawn in favor of the pleading.  (Schifando
v. City of Los Angeles (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1074, 1081; Marina Pacific
Hotel and Suites, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at p. 104.)  Even “improbable” facts alleged in the
pleading must be accepted as true.  (Marina
Pacific Hotel and Suites, supra, 81 Cal.App.5th at pp. 104-105.)
Courts must “liberally construe the pleading” and “give the
complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in
context.”  (Id. at p. 105.)
A complaint must contain a “statement of facts constituting
the cause of action, in ordinary and concise language.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.10, subd. (a)(1); see
also C.A. v. William S. Hart High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861,
872 [“the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a cause of
action”].)  Ordinarily, a complaint “is
sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than evidentiary facts.”  (Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42
Cal.4th 531, 550.)  Ultimate facts are
those upon which “the right to recover depends” and are “essential” to the
cause of action.  (Estes v. Eaton
Corp. (2020) 51 Cal.App.5th 636, 643 fn. 2; see also 1 Weil & Brown, supra,
¶ 6:124.)
A plaintiff is required to plead only “the essential facts of
[its] case” that are sufficient “to acquaint a defendant with the nature,
source and extent of [the] cause of action.” 
(Doe, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 550.)  Mere boilerplate or pleading of legal
conclusions is not sufficient.  (Id.
at p. 551 fn. 5.)  But a plaintiff need
not allege “each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of
plaintiff’s proof” at trial.  (C.A.,
supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 872.)
A demurrer can be sustained only when it
disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp.
(2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev.
Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)
Leave to amend should be granted when “there is a
reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.”  (Centinela Freeman, supra, 1 Cal.5th
at p. 1010; Blank, supra, 39 Cal.3d at p. 318; Shaeffer v. Califia
Farms (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 1125, 1145.)
Motion to Strike
 
Under Code of Civil
Procedure section 435, “Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(1).)
Code of Civil
Procedure section 436 provides:
“The court may, upon a motion made pursuant to Section 435,
or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper:
(a) Strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading.
(b) Strike out all or
any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this
state, a court rule, or an order of the court.”
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 436.) In ruling on a motion to strike, the court must assume the
truth of the properly pleaded facts in the complaint or other pleading. (Turman
v. Turning Point of Central California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53,
63.) 
Attorney’s Fees
Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b), provides for both
discretionary and mandatory relief, under certain circumstances, from a “judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against” a party.  Subdivision (b) also provides, “The court
shall, whenever relief is granted based on an attorney’s affidavit of fault,
direct the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to
opposing counsel or parties.” 
Meet and Confer Requirement
Before filing a demurrer or motion to strike,
the parties must meet and confer.  (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, subd. (a) & 435.5, subdivision (a).) 
That
requirement is satisfied here.  (Levine Decls.,
¶ 2.)
Discussion
Demurrer
Defendant demurs to Plaintiff’s FAC on the
grounds that Plaintiff fails to state facts sufficient to constitute both the
negligence and vicarious liability causes of action against Defendant.
The basic elements of a cause of
action for negligence are: (1) the existence of a legal duty; (2) breach of
that duty; (3) causation; and (4) resulting damages. (Brown v. USA
Taekwondo (2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 213; Kesner v. Superior Court
(2016) 1 Cal.5th 1132, 1158; Romero v. Los Angeles Rams (2023) 91
Cal.App.5th 562, 567.)
With regard to vicarious liability, Civil Code section 2338
provides, “a principal is responsible to third persons for the negligence of
his agent in the transaction of the business of the agency, including wrongful
acts committed by such agent in and as part of the transaction of such
business.”  “The respondeat superior
doctrine makes an employer liable, irrespective of fault, for an employee’s
tortious conduct in the scope of employment.” 
(Diaz v. Carcamo (2011) 51 Cal.4th 1148, 1154.)  “[A]n employer is vicariously liable for the
torts of its employees committed within the scope of employment.”  (Lisa
M. v. Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital (1995)
12 Cal.4th 291, 296.)
Here, Plaintiff alleges in the FAC that Defendant
received funds from the Los Angeles Housing Services Authority and other
entities to provide services to homeless or unhoused people, including
housing.  (FAC, ¶¶ 7-8.) Defendant and Homeless
Outreach Program Integrated Care Systems (“HOPICS”) had some of the same people
as officers and directors, and Defendant retained or assigned HOPICS to place
unhoused individuals in housing. (FAC, ¶¶ 6, 9.) HOPICS states on its website
that it is a division of Defendant. 
(FAC, ¶ 11.)  In November 2020,
Defendant or HOPICS assisted Plaintiff with housing (owned and managed by other
defendants), and arranged payment for rent for Plaintiff. (FAC, ¶¶ 13, 16.) 
Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant or HOPICS
also helped Defendant Brown rent a room in the same home as Plaintiff, and
Plaintiff and Brown shared the same case manager Defendant Williams, who was
employed by Defendant or HOPICS. (FAC, ¶¶ 17, 19-20.) 
According to Plaintiff, on the day before the incident,
Defendant Brown threatened Plaintiff; Defendant Williams was present and heard
the threats.  (FAC, ¶¶ 22-23, 26.) Defendant
Williams also saw that Defendant Brown had a hot plate, which was a prohibited
item in the house.  (FAC, ¶¶ 24-25.) Despite
hearing Defendant Brown threaten Plaintiff, Defendant Williams did not exercise
his authority to move either Defendant Brown or Plaintiff out of the house and
into a motel or hotel.  (FAC, ¶¶ 26-28.)
On the next day, May 12, 2021, at approximately 2 am, Defendant Brown poured
scalding hot water on Plaintiff while he slept. (FAC, ¶ 29.) 
Taking these allegations as true, as the Court
must on demurrer, and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the pleader,
Plaintiff has stated a cause of action for negligence/vicarious liability
against Defendant.  Plaintiff has alleged
that Defendant Williams was an employee of Defendant and that Defendant
Williams, while acting within the course and scope of her employment, owed
Plaintiff a duty of care, that Defendant Williams breached the duty of care,
and that the breach by Defendant Williams caused Plaintiff to be injured.  The Court, of course, does not know whether Plaintiff
will be able to prove these allegations, but Plaintiff has adequately pleaded
his causes of action against Defendant.
Accordingly,
Defendants’ demurrer is overruled.
 
Motion to Strike
 
Defendant
seeks to strike the request for punitive damages from the prayer for relief in Plaintiff’s
FAC. 
The law is clear that
to recover punitive damages in a tort action, Civil Code
section 3294, subdivision (a), requires a plaintiff to prove by clear and
convincing evidence “that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud,
or malice.”  (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd.
(a); see also College Hosp., Inc. v. Super. Ct. (1994) 8
Cal.4th 704, 721; Smith v. Super. Ct. (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1033, 1042.)

“Malice” is defined in section
3294, subdivision (c)(1), as “conduct which is intended by the defendant to
cause injury” or “despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with
a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” 
“Oppression” is defined in
section 3294, subdivision (c)(2), as “despicable conduct subjecting a person to
cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.”
“Fraud” is defined in section
3294, subdivision (c)(3), as “an
intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact known
to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby
depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.” 
The term “despicable conduct,” as used in subdivisions (c)(1) and
(c)(2), has been defined in the case
law as actions that are “base,” “vile,” or “contemptible.” (See, e.g., College Hospital, supra, 8 Cal.4th at p. 725; Shade Foods, Inc. v. Innovative Products Sales &
Marketing, Inc. (2000) 78 Cal. App. 4th
847, 891; see also CACI 3940 [“Despicable conduct is conduct that is so
vile, base, or contemptible that it would be looked down on and despised by
reasonable people.”].)
The
basis for punitive damages must be pleaded with particularity; conclusory
allegations devoid of any factual assertions are insufficient. (Ibid.;
see also Anschutz Entertainment Group, Inc. v. Snepp (2009) 171
Cal.App.4th 598, 643.) A motion to strike may lie where the facts alleged, if
proven, would not support a finding that the defendant acted with malice, fraud,
or oppression. (Today IV’s Inc. v. Los Angeles County MTA (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th
1137, 1193; Turman, supra, 191 Cal. App. 4th at p. 63.)
Pleading negligence, gross negligence, or even recklessness is not
sufficient. (Dawes v. Super. Ct. (1980) 111 Cal. App. 3d 82, 87.)
Rather, a plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating that the defendant intended
to cause harm to plaintiff or “acted in such an outrageous and reprehensible
manner that the jury could infer that [the defendant] knowingly disregarded the
substantial certainty of injury to others.” (Id. at p. 90; see also,
e.g., American Airlines, Inc. v. Sheppard, Mullin, Richter
& Hampton (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 1017.). 
Moreover,
when a plaintiff seeks to recover punitive damages against an employer for the
acts of its employee, Civil Code section 3294, subdivision (b), sets forth
additional requirements:
 
“An employer shall not be liable for [punitive]
damages pursuant to subdivision (a), based upon acts of an employee of the
employer, unless the employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the
employee and employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or
safety of others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for which the
damages are awarded or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice.
With respect to a corporate employer, the advance knowledge and conscious
disregard, authorization, ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice
must be on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the
corporation.”
 
(Civ.
Code, § 3294, subd. (b).)
 
The allegations of the FAC fall far short of
meeting this high pleading standard.  To
the contrary, all that is alleged in the FAC is negligence, which is not a basis
to recover punitive damages.  There are
no allegations of oppression, fraud, or malice, and no allegations that an
officer, director, or managing agent of Defendant had advance knowledge of the unfitness of any employee
and employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or safety of
others; authorized or ratified the allegedly wrongful conduct; or was
personally guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice.
Accordingly, the motion to strike is GRANTED.
As this is the first ruling on the adequacy
of the pleading of the claim for punitive damages, and as this ruling is based
on a deficiency in the pleading, the Court grants leave to amend.
Motion for Attorney’s Fees
Defendant seeks attorney’s fees under Code of
Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (b). 
The Court previously vacated a judgment in favor of Defendant in this
action, and under subdivision (b), “[t]he court
shall, whenever relief is granted based on an attorney’s affidavit of fault,
direct the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs to
opposing counsel or parties.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd.(b).)
Notwithstanding Plaintiff’s contention to the
contrary in his opposition, Defendant has shown that the Court granted relief
to Plaintiff based on the mandatory provision of section 473, subdivision (b),
based on the attorney’s affidavit of fault. 
(See Minute Order dated August 22, 2024.)  Accordingly, the request for fees is granted.
The Court sets the amount of reasonable
compensatory legal fees and costs in the amount of $2,310, based on a total of nine
hours of attorney time (two for the opposition to the ex parte application to
shorten time, three for the opposition to the motion, two for the supplemental
briefing, and two for preparation of this motion) multiplied by counsel’s
reasonable billing rate of $250 per hour, plus a $60 filing fee.  (See Levine Decl., ¶¶ 11-13.)  
Conclusion
The Court OVERRULES Defendant’s demurrer to
the First Amended Complaint.
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to
strike, as against Defendant, the request for punitive damages in the prayer
for relief, page 12, line 20, item 7.
The Court GRANTS Plaintiff leave to file an
amended complaint by no later than January 17, 2025.
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s request for
attorney fees.
The Court ORDERS Plaintiff’s counsel Barbara
K. Ratliff to pay attorney’s fees and costs in the amount of $2,310 to
Defendant (through counsel) under the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure section
473, subdivision (b), within 30 days of notice.
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
