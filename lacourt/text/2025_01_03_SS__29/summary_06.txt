And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying without prejudice the motion filed by Plaintiff's Counsel, Tom Vertanous, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was not properly served, and only proof of service for the declaration of Counsel was filed, not for the other supporting documents. Additionally, the declaration did not properly describe the reasons for the motion. The court may order an attorney to be changed or substituted at any time, but the motion must be properly served and filed.
