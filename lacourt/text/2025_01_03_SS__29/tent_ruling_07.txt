 Case Number:  23STCV17521    Hearing Date:   January 3, 2025    Dept:  29 Mashian v. Sweet Flower Management LLC
23STCV17521
Defendants’ Motion to Compel the Deposition of Plaintiff and also to Compel a
Physical Examination of Plaintiff.
Tentative
The motion is denied without prejudice on
procedural grounds.
In this one motion, Defendants seek two
separate and distinct forms of relief: an order compelling Plaintiff to appear
for deposition under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 and an order
compelling Plaintiff to comply with a demand for a physical examination under
Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.250.
This is procedurally improper.  If Defendants seek two separate orders under
two separate statutes relating to two separate discovery methods, they must
file two separate motions, reserve two hearing dates, and pay two filing fees.
Accordingly, the motion is denied without prejudice.
Moving party to give notice.
