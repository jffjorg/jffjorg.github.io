BACKGROUND 
This is a wrongful death/survival action stemming from an
allegations of medical malpractice. On July 25, 2023, plaintiff Nancy Page,
individually and as successor-in-interest for George Page, filed this action against
defendant Thai V. Le, M.D. (“Le”) and Does 1 through 100, alleging causes of
action for wrongful death based on medical malpractice and medical malpractice
through a survival action. 
On December 19, 2023, the Court deemed this action and case no.
20STCV18421 related within the meaning of California Rules of Court, rule
3.300(a), with 20STCV18421 being the lead case. In 20STCV18421 (the “Lead
Case”), plaintiffs George Page and Nancy Page initiated a malpractice action on
May 14, 2020 against defendants Myron Mariano, M.D., Le, Emanate Health
Foothill Presbyterian Hospital, and Kindred Hospital San Gabriel Valley,
alleging causes of action for medical malpractice and loss of consortium. 
In the Lead Case, the plaintiffs alleged that George Page
consulted with and/or retained the defendants to take care of his medical needs
starting around May 17, 2019. (Compl. re: Lead Case at ¶¶ 6-7.) These
defendants recommended a course of treatment that plaintiff George Page relied
on, but it was to his detriment. (Id. at ¶ 8.) It was due to these
defendants’ negligence that plaintiff George Page was harmed. As a result of
plaintiff George Page’s injuries, plaintiff Nancy Page has suffered a loss of
consortium. (Id. at ¶¶ 14-15.) 
In the instant action, plaintiff Nancy Page alleges that George
Page (“Decedent”) passed away on July 31, 2022 due to the negligent medical
care that he received from Le. (Compl. re: 
23PSCV02245 at ¶¶ 7-9.) 
On April 8, 2024, Le filed a demurrer in the instant action pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure § 430.10(c). On April 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed an
opposition the demurrer. On May 6, 2024, Le filed his reply. 
LEGAL
STANDARD – Demurrer 
            A demurrer
can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading
under attack or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable. (¿¿Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318¿¿.) “¿To
survive a demurrer, the complaint need only allege facts sufficient to state a
cause of action; each evidentiary fact that might eventually form part of the
plaintiff’s proof need not be alleged.¿” (¿¿C.A. v. William S. Hart Union
High School Dist. (2012) 53 Cal.4th 861, 872¿¿.) For the purpose of testing
the sufficiency of the cause of action, the demurrer admits the truth of all
material facts properly pleaded. (¿Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist.
(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 966-967¿.) A demurrer “¿does not admit contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law.¿” (¿¿Daar v. Yellow Cab Co.
(1967) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713¿¿.) 
“A plea in abatement pursuant to section 430.10, subdivision (c),
may be made by demurrer or answer when there is another action pending between
the same parties on the same cause of action. In determining whether the causes
of action are the same for purposes of pleas in abatement, the rule is that
such a plea may be maintained only¿where a judgment in the first action would
be a complete bar to the second action.¿Where a demurrer is sustained on the
ground of another action pending, the proper order is not a dismissal, but abatement of further proceedings pending termination of the first action.”  (Plant Insulation Co. v. Fibreboard Corp. (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 781, 787–788 (internal citations omitted).) 
REQUEST FOR
JUDICIAL NOTICE 
The Court GRANTS Le’s request for judicial notice of Exhibit B, the
Complaint filed in the Lead Case. The Court
takes judicial notice only as to the existence, content, and authenticity of
such document; it does not take judicial notice of the truth of the factual
matters asserted therein. (Dominguez v. Bonta
(2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.) 
DISCUSSION –
Demurrer 
Meet and Confer 
Per Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), Le
was required to meet and confer with Plaintiff before bringing this demurrer.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) The Court finds Le’s meet-and-confer
efforts sufficient. (Greco Decl., ¶ 5.)   
            Special Demurrer for Abatement
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 430.10(c) 
Le
demurs to the Second Cause of Action medical malpractice through a survival
action on the ground that there is “another pending action between the same
parties on the same cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 430.10(c).) 
“Under
the statutory plea in abatement, ‘[t]he pendency of another earlier action
growing out of the same transaction and between the same parties is a ground
for abatement of the second action.’ A statutory plea in abatement requires
that the prior pending action be ‘between the same parties on the same cause of
action.’” (People ex rel. Garamendi v. American Autoplan, Inc. (1993) 20
Cal.App.4th 760, 770 (internal citation and italicization omitted).) 
Here,
Le contends that the medical malpractice claim asserted in the Lead Case is
identical to plaintiff Nancy Page’s claim for medical malpractice through a survival
action that is brought in her capacity as Decedent’s successor-in-interest.
(Demurrer at pg. 5.) Le further asserts that the Lead Case can only proceed if
plaintiff Nancy Page amends the complaint there to state a survival action. (Ibid.)
Moreover, both actions allege that the harm incurred stems from Le’s alleged
negligence. (Ibid.) 
In
opposition, plaintiff Nancy Page argues that Code of Civil Procedure section 377.34
establishes a distinct primary right separating her survival claim from Decedent’s
personal injury claims, and as a result, Plaintiff asserts that the instant
action should not be stayed pending the resolution of the Lead Case.
(Opposition at pp. 5-8.) However, plaintiff Nancy Page fails to cite to any
legal authority that supports this interpretation of Section 377.34. Upon a
straight-forward reading of Section 377.34, the statue merely specifies what
damages a decedent’s personal representative or successor-in-interest may
recover from the decedent’s cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc. § 377.34(a),
(b).) Furthermore, the purpose of a survival action is to “prevent the abatement
of the cause of action of the injured person, and provide for its enforcement
by or against the personal representative of the deceased.” (Grant v.
McAuliffe (1953) 41 Cal.2d 859, 864.) 
Considering
the Lead Case has been pending since May 14, 2020, the proper course of action
would have been to amend the complaint to assert a survival action. It appears
that plaintiff Nancy Page’s intention in filing the instant action in 2023 was
to allow her to recover damages for pain and suffering pursuant to Section
377.34(b). (See Code Civ Proc. § 377.34 [disallowing the recovery of damages
from pain, suffering or disfigurement unless the action “was granted a
preference pursuant to Section 36 before January 1, 2022 or was filed on or
after January 1, 2022 and before January 1, 2026.”].) 
Because
plaintiff Nancy Page’s medical malpractice survival claim in the instant action
is the same as Decedent’s medical malpractice claims asserted in the Lead Case,
a stay is necessary pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10(c).
Although different damages may be recovered, it is apparent from the face of
the complaints that both claims involve substantially the same cause of action
for medical negligence/malpractice and substantially the same issues. Indeed, a
judgment in favor of Le in the Lead Case would certainly preclude the survival
action in the instant case. In fact, Plaintiff states as much in the Opposition
indicating that a resolution of the instant case would also resolve the Lead
Case. (Opp. p. 6:22-24.) 
Accordingly,
Le’s demurrer to the Second Cause of Action is sustained on this ground.  
CONCLUSION 
The Court SUSTAINS Defendant Thai V. Le, M.D.’s Demurrer to the
Second Cause of Acton for
medical malpractice through a survival action. Consequently, the Second Cause of
Action is held in abeyance until the Lead Action has concluded. Defendant shall
submit the appropriate proposed order and interlocutory judgment. 
            Defendant is ordered to give notice
of the Court’s ruling within five calendar days of this order.
