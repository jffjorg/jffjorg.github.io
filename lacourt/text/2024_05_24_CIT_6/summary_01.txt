And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling in a case involving a wrongful death/survival action stemming from an allegation of medical malpractice. The plaintiff, Nancy Page, filed the action against defendant Thai V. Le, M.D. and others. The defendant demurred to the complaint, arguing that the medical malpractice claim asserted in the Lead Case is identical to the claim in the instant action. The judge sustained the demurrer, holding that the Second Cause of Action is the same as the cause of action in the Lead Case, and that the Lead Case must be resolved before the instant case can proceed. The judge ordered the defendant to submit a proposed order and interlocutory judgment, and to give notice of the ruling within five calendar days.
