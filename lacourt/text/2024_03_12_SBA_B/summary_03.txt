Summary:

The tentative ruling is a decision by the judge on a demurrer filed by defendant Dignity Community Care dba Northridge Hospital Medical Center to the First Amended Complaint (FAC) filed by plaintiff Barbara Clark. The judge sustains the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend. The FAC alleges elder abuse, negligence, and corporate ratification against Prime Healthcare Centinela, LLC dba Centinela Hospital Medical Center, Dignity Community Care dba Northridge Hospital Medical Center, and Parkwest Rehabilitation Center, LLC dba Parkwest Healthcare Center. The judge finds that the allegations are insufficient because they do not show malicious conduct by Dignity Community Care, and the FAC fails to sufficiently show abuse and neglect by defendant.
