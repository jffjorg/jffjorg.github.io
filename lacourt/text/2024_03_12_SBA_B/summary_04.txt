And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the petition for relief from the government claims statute filed by Jennifer Lanchinebre against the City of Inglewood, County of Los Angeles, and State of California. The petition alleges that Lanchinebre was injured when she stepped and/or tripped on a rope and/or similar object at SoFi Stadium and that she failed to file her claims within the statutory period due to a calendaring error. The court finds that Lanchinebre's failure to file her claims within the statutory period was excusable neglect, as she had diligently worked on her claim and had not intentionally avoided filing her claims. The court also finds that the respondents would not be prejudiced by granting of the petition. Therefore, the court grants the petition and allows Lanchinebre to present her late claims.
