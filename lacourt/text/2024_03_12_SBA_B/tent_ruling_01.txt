Motion
for Summary Judgment 
            The court considered the moving,
opposition, and reply papers.  
RULING
            Defendant TMMC’s Motion for Summary
Judgment is GRANTED.  
BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff Claudia Mendoza underwent
an ultrasound for her pregnancy on July 21, 2020, as ordered by
Defendants.  Defendant Albert Grabb, MD
read the ultrasound that day and reported that the images suggested there was
an abortion in progress.  Defendant
Ricardo Huete, MD thereafter prescribed Misoprostol to Claudia and directed her
to take it to help purge the alleged dead fetus.  
            Thereafter, another ultrasound was
performed by Defendants that revealed evidence of a fetal heartbeat.[1]  As a result of these acts, Claudia alleges
she was forced to undergo a hysterectomy. 

            On February 7, 2022, Plaintiffs
Claudia Mendoza and Salvador Mendoza Maldonado filed this action against
Torrance Memorial Medical Center, Torrance Memorial Physicians Network,
Torrance Radiology Medical Group, Richard Huete, MD and Albert Grabb, MD based
on Defendants’ treatment of Claudia Mendoza for her pregnancy.  Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges (1) Negligence
(all Defendants); (2) negligence (against Torrance Memorial Physician Network
and Torrance Radiology).
LEGAL AUTHORITY
            The elements of a medical
malpractice cause of action are (1) the duty of the professional to use such
skill, prudence, and diligence as other members of his profession commonly
possess and exercise; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a proximate causal connection
between the negligent conduct and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or
damage resulting from the professional's negligence.  (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical
Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 468 fn 2.)  
            The standard of skill, knowledge and
care prevailing in a medical community is ordinarily a matter within the
knowledge of experts.  (Jambazian v.
Borden (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 836, 844.) 
“The standard of care for physicians is the reasonable degree of skill,
knowledge and care ordinarily possessed and exercised by members of the medical
profession under similar circumstances. 
The test for determining familiarity with the standard of care is
knowledge of similar conditions. 
Geographical location may be a factor considered in making that determination,
but, by itself, does not provide a practical basis for measuring similar
circumstances.”  (Avivi v. Centro
Medico Urgente Medical Center, supra, at 159 Cal.App.4th at 470.)
            Whether the standard of care in the
community has been breached presents a basic issue of fact in a malpractice
action which can only be proved by expert opinion testimony unless the medical
question is within the common knowledge of laypersons.  (Id. at 470, fn. 1; 1 Witkin, Cal.
Evid. (6th ed. 2021), Opinion, §52.) 
“[A]n opinion unsupported by reasons or explanations does not establish
the absence of a material fact issue for trial, as required for summary
judgment.”  (Golden Eagle Refinery
Co., Inc. v. Associated Intern. Ins. Co. (2001) 85 Cal.App.4th 1300, 1315
(citing Kelley v. Trunk (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 519, 524).  Accordingly, where a plaintiff provides
proper opposing expert testimony via a declaration, a triable issue of material
fact is raised which precludes summary judgment.  (Jambazian, supra, 25 Cal.App.4th at
844.)  The absence of opinion evidence on
this issue is fatal to the plaintiff’s cause of action.  (Willard v. Hagemeister (1981) 121
Cal.App.3d 406, 412.)  An expert
declaration is admissible as long as Defendants’ expert states in detail his
qualifications and the factual basis for his opinion.  (Kelley, supra, 66 Cal.App.4th
at 524.)  
            Expert testimony is also required to
establish the element of causation in a medical malpractice action.  “The law is well settled that in a personal
injury action causation must be proven within a reasonable medical probability
based on competent expert testimony. Mere possibility alone is insufficient to
establish a prima facie case. That there is a distinction between a reasonable
medical probability and a medical possibility needs little discussion. There
can be many possible causes, indeed, an infinite number of circumstances that
can produce an injury or disease. A possible cause only becomes probable when,
in the absence of other reasonable causal explanations, it becomes more likely
than not that the injury was a result of its action. This is the outer limit of
inference upon which an issue may be submitted to the jury.”  (Jennings v. Palomar Pomerado Health
Systems, Inc. (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 1108, 1118 (trial court properly
struck medical expert testimony on issue of causation where expert’s opinion
failed to provide a reasoned explanation regarding the etiology connecting
plaintiff’s infected subcutaneous tissue to the nidus inside peritoneal cavity
where retractor was retained).  
DISCUSSION
            Plaintiffs’
Evidentiary Objection
            OVERRULE
(Only one objection asserted)
            Defendant
TMMC’s Motion for Summary Judgment
            TMMC
moves for summary judgment on grounds that it complied with the standard of
care at all times.  TMMC argues
Plaintiffs’ injuries are not attributable to the care provided by TMMC.  TMMC relies on the expert declarations of
Drs. Kessler and Tchelepi.
            TMMC
argues the nursing care provided is not at issue.  TMMC argues Defendant Huete was actively
involved in Claudia’s prenatal care, delivery and post-natal care.  TMMC argues there is no evidence that the
nursing staff breached any standard of care.
            TMMC
argues the ultrasound technician, Marie Pine, conducted the ultrasound and
prepared the worksheet but did not make any final impressions, diagnoses or
conclusions.  TMMC argues expert Tchelepi
opines that Pine’s conduct was within the standard of care.  TMMC argues Defendant Grabb prepared his own
report regarding the ultrasound.  
            TMMC
argues Huete was not negligent when he prescribed misoprostol.  TMMC argues misoprostol is prescribed to a
patient when she is in the process of suffering a miscarriage.  TMMC argues Huete complied with the
applicable standard of care in ultimately performing a C-section on Claudia and
performing a total abdominal hysterectomy. 
TMMC argues Claudia underwent a hysterectomy, because she suffered from
placenta percreta during the pregnancy. TMMC argues there is no known
connection between misoprostol and development of placenta percreta.
            TMMC
argues it did not breach any standard of care in providing medical care to
Claudia.  TMMC argues no negligent act or
failure to act by it was a substantial factor in causing any injury to
Plaintiffs.  
            TMMC
argues Huete was not its agent or employee. 
TMMC argues it cannot be held vicariously liable for the alleged
negligence of any physician who provided care at TMMC under an agency theory or
ostensible agency theory.  TMMC argues
Claudia signed admission forms on five separate occasions that expressly stated
the physicians were not TMMC’s agents.  TMMC
argues the language of the admissions forms were straightforward and clear, and
Claudia was not incapacitated at the time she signed them.  
            TMMC
argues Salvador Maldonado’s Loss of Consortium claim also fails.  TMMC argues the loss of consortium claim
cannot be sustained where there is no underlying negligence to the spouse.  
            Plaintiffs’
Opposition 
            Plaintiffs
argue Defendants Huete and Grabb were ostensible agents of TMMC.  Plaintiffs argue the issue of ostensible
agency is a question of fact that cannot be resolved on summary judgment.  Plaintiffs argue Claudia was always under the
belief that TMMC employed Huete and Grabb. 

            Plaintiffs
also argue TMMC failed to submit evidence to show that Huete and Grabb complied
with the standard of care.  Plaintiff
argues TMMC failed to submit any evidence as to Grabb’s conduct.  
            Plaintiffs
argue triable issues of fact remain as to whether Huete breached the applicable
standard of care.  Plaintiffs’ expert,
Dr. Adamczak, opines that Huete’s treatment of Plaintiffs fell below the
standard of care, because he (1) relied on an ultrasound that was not
diagnostic of a failed pregnancy; (2) erroneously concluded that there was an
abortion despite the rising Beta hCG levels; (3) hastily prescribing misoprostol
without conducting further test or taking additional ultrasounds; (4) failing
to disclose the risks of taking misoprostol while possibly pregnant; and (5)
failing to disclose, if not intentionally concealing, the teratogenic risks on
a fetus’ development associated with taking misoprostol while pregnant after it
was discovered that Baby Cataleya was alive and after it was discovered that
Baby Cataleya had developed cleft lip and palate.  
            Plaintiffs
argue Defendant TMMC also fails to fully address causation, because defense
expert’s testimony is limited to Plaintiff’s hysterectomy.  Plaintiffs argue Claudia suffered multiple
injuries, not just the hysterectomy. 
Plaintiffs argue she is also alleging injury based on Baby Cataleya’s
birth defects, which have resulted in Plaintiffs’ economic and noneconomic
injuries.  Plaintiffs’ expert testifies
that Baby Cataleya’s cleft lip and palate lip were the result of the
misoprostol.  Plaintiffs argue Huete
never disclosed the risks of misoprostol, even after they discovered Baby
Cataleya was a viable pregnancy, after they discovered the baby suffered from
cleft palate and palate lip in utero and after Claudia asked him directly if
the drug could cause defects.  Plaintiffs
argue Huete denied that the medication could have caused cleft lip and
palate.  
            Plaintiffs
argue Salvador Mendoza suffered injuries separate and apart from Claudia.  Plaintiffs argue Claudia’s depression and
pain and suffering in turn contributed to Salvador’s loss of consortium.  
            Plaintiffs
argue the complaint sufficiently informs Defendants of injuries separate and
apart from the hysterectomy.  Plaintiffs
argue the complaint sufficiently alleges that they are seeking damages for
injuries arising from ingestion of misoprostol, which led to Baby Cataleya’s
defects and the need for Claudia to undergo a hysterectomy.  
            TMMC’s
Reply
            TMMC
argues on reply that Plaintiffs’ evidentiary objection to the admissions forms
signed by Plaintiff are meritless.  TMMC
argues the admissions forms were authenticated as part of Claudia’s medical
records.  TMMC argues the admissions
forms are admissible and establish that Plaintiffs were on notice that Huete
and Grabb were not TMMC’s employees or agents. 
TMMC argues Plaintiffs fail to submit any evidence challenging the
authenticity of the admissions forms. 
TMMC argues Claudia’s testimony that she does not recall signing them
does not raise a triable issue of fact as to whether she signed them. TMMC
argues Claudia does not claim that she did not sign these forms or that the
signatures are not authentic.  TMMC
argues the only theory Plaintiffs are proceeding on as to TMMC is ostensible
agency.  TMMC argues the undisputed facts
establish that Huete was not an ostensible agent of TMMC.  
            TMMC
argues the motion for summary judgment must therefore be granted because
nothing it or its agents or employees did fell below the standard of care or
was substantial factor in causing Plaintiffs’ injuries. 
            TMMC
negates Plaintiffs’ allegations of negligence
            TMMC
establishes with admissible evidence that nothing it or its agents or employees
did fell below the standard of care or was a substantial factor in causing
Plaintiffs’ injuries.  TMMC’s expert, L.
Joel Kessler, testifies that none of TMMC’s nursing staff, employees and agents
were not negligent and were not a substantial factor in causing Plaintiffs’
injuries.  (Defendant’s Evidence, Kessler
Dec., ¶22.)  The ultrasound technician’s
conduct was within the applicable standard of care.  (Defendant’s Evidence, SSUMF No. 22.)  
            The
wrongful conduct alleged in the complaint includes diagnosis of Claudia as being
in the process of an abortion and Defendant Huete prescription of misoprostol
to her as a result.  Plaintiffs’ claims
against TMMC are based on the allegation that Huete and Grabb were the agents
or employees of Defendant Huete.
            “A
staff physician treats his patients at the hospital. He has full authority to
prescribe the patients’ treatment, he is subject to no supervision during the
course of treatment, and he generally bears full responsibility for
negligence.” (University of Southern California v. Superior Court of Los
Angeles County (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1283, 1290.)  
            Ostensible
agency requires two elements: conduct by the hospital that would cause a
reasonable person to believe that the physician was an agent of the hospital,
and (2) reliance on that apparent agency relationship by the plaintiff. (Mejia
v. Community Hospital of San Bernardino (2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1448, 1453.)  Regarding the first element, courts generally
conclude that it is satisfied when the hospital “holds itself out” to the
public as a provider of care. (Id. at p. 1454.) The second element,
reliance, is established when the plaintiff “looks to” the hospital for
services, rather than to an individual physician.  (Id.) Reliance need not be provided by
direct testimony. “If a person voluntarily enters a hospital without objecting
to his or her admission to the hospital, then that person is seeking care from
the hospital itself.” (Id.)
            “[H]ospitals
are generally deemed to have held themselves out as the provider of services
unless they gave the patient contrary notice, and the patient is generally
presumed to have looked to the hospital for care unless he or she was treated
by his or her personal physician. Thus, unless the patient had some reason to
know of the true relationship between the hospital and the physician—i.e., because
the hospital gave the patient actual notice or because the patient was treated
by his or her personal physician—ostensible agency is readily inferred.”  (Mejia, supra, 99 Cal.App.4th at
1454–1455 (emphasis added).)  “In the
physician-hospital-patient context, ostensible agency is a factual issue
‘[u]nless the evidence conclusively indicates that the patient should have
known that the treating physician was not the hospital's agent, such as when
the patient is treated by his or her personal physician’ or received actual
notice of the absence of any agency relationship.”  (Magallanes v. Doctors Medical Center of
Modesto (2022) 80 Cal.App.5th 914, 923.) 

            TMMC
establishes that Huete was never its employee or agent during his treatment of Claudia
and that in general, none of the physicians and surgeons who treated Claudia at
TMMC are its employees or agents.  (Defendant’s
Evidence, Goethals Dec., Ex. T.)  Claudia
signed five admissions forms acknowledging this fact.  (Defendant’s Evidence, Goethals Dec., Ex. T.)  These admissions forms were signed on July
21, 2020, August 3, 2020, January 25, 2021, January 26, 2021 and February 8,
2021, which covers the relevant time period alleged in the complaint.  (Defendant’s Evidence, Goethals Dec., Ex. T.)  In addition, Huete testified at deposition
that during the relevant period he was only employed by Torrance Memorial
Health Systems and MedLex Corporation. 
(Defendant’s Evidence, Goethals Dec., Ex. U.)  TMMC therefore negates any basis to impose
vicarious liability on it for the acts of Huete or Grabb.  
            TMMC
therefore negates Plaintiffs’ allegations of negligence against it.  The burden therefore shifts to Plaintiffs to
raise a triable issue of material fact as to TMMC’s negligence.
            Plaintiffs
fail to raise a triable issue of material fact as to TMMC’s negligence
            In
opposition, Plaintiff argues ostensible agency is to be assumed by the courts
and is a question of fact.  Plaintiff
argues it must be presumed that Grabb and Huete were ostensible agents of
TMMC.  
            Plaintiff
argues (1) the Conditions of Admission relied upon by TMMC are inadmissible due
to lack of authentication of the five admissions forms signed by Claudia
acknowledging that none of the physicians or surgeons who treated her at TMMC
were TMMC’s agents or employees; and (2) Claudia always believed Defendants
Grabb and Huete were employees of TMMC.  
            Plaintiffs’
objection based on lack of authentication is overruled.  Defendant TMMC includes the declaration of
the Custodian of Records authenticating Plaintiff Claudia’s medical records,
which included the admissions forms signed by her.  (Defendant’s Evidence, Ex. 3.)  Counsel Goethals authenticates Defendant’s Exhibit
T as part of those authenticated medical records.  Plaintiffs’ evidentiary objection to
Defendant’s Exhibit T is overruled. 
            Claudia’s
testimony does not raise a triable issue of fact as to the five signed
acknowledgements that any of the doctors or surgeons she treated with at TMMC
were not employees or agents of TMMC.  Claudia
testifies that she believed Huete to be “part of Torrance Memorial Medical
Center’s network” and she does not recall signing any document regarding the
relationship between Huete and Torrance Memorial Medical Center.  (Plaintiffs’ Separate Statement, C. Maldonado
Dec., ¶¶2-3.)
            Claudia’s
declaration does not mention Grabb. 
Claudia’s declaration therefore raises no issue of fact as to
Grabb.  
            Claudia’s
belief that Huete was included in the network of doctors at TMMC does not
establish an employment relationship.  To
the extent Claudia is claiming ostensible agency, the acknowledgement she
signed is a clear and express statement informing her that none of the doctors
or surgeons who treat her at TMMC are TMMC’s agents or employees.  Her failure to recall signing the forms does
not negate TMMC’s evidence that she signed them.  Claudia therefore fails to raise a triable
issue of fact as to her acknowledgments that there was no employment or agency relationship
between any doctor or surgeon who treated her at TMMC, including Huete and
Grabb, and TMMC.  
            Plaintiffs
fail to raise a triable issue of fact as to TMMC’s negligence or its vicarious
liability for Huete’s or Grabb’s negligence. 
Defendant TMMC’s motion for summary judgment is therefore granted.  
            Huete’s
negligence and purported Motion for Summary Judgment 
            The
court notes that Huete did not file his own motion for summary judgment nor is
he identified as a moving party in TMMC’s notice of motion for summary
judgment.  Although TMMC argued Huete’s
lack of negligence, Huete did not join in the motion.  Because TMMC’s liability can be adjudicated
without reaching Huete’s negligence, the court leaves the issue of Huete’s
negligence, an issue more properly addressed by Huete.  
            On
December 21, 2023, Defendant Torrance Memorial Physicians Network (“Physicians”)
filed a “Notice of Joinder and Joinder by Defendant Torrance Memorial
Physicians Network to Defendant Ricardo Huete, M.D.’s Motion for Summary
Judgment Memorandum of Points and Authorities.” 
Physicians’ Notice of Joinder and MP&As clearly indicate it is
joining in the Huete’s Motion for Summary Judgment, not TMMC’s Motion for
Summary Judgment or Radiology and Grabb’s Motion for Summary Judgment.  Based on the court’s review of the docket,
Defendant Ricardo Huete did not file any motion for summary judgment.  As such, there is no motion for summary
judgment to which Physicians’ can join. 
ORDER
             Defendant TMMC’s Motion for Summary Judgment
is GRANTED. 
            Moving
party is ordered to give notice of ruling.

RULING
            Defendants Radiology and Grabb’s
Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.  
BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff Claudia Mendoza underwent
an ultrasound for her pregnancy on July 21, 2020, as ordered by
Defendants.  Defendant Albert Grabb, MD
read the ultrasound that day and reported that the images suggested there was
an abortion in progress.  Defendant
Ricardo Huete, MD thereafter prescribed Misoprostol to Claudia and directed her
to take it to help purge the alleged dead fetus.  
            Thereafter, another ultrasound was
performed by Defendants that revealed evidence of a fetal heartbeat.  As a result, Claudia was forced to undergo a
hysterectomy.  
            On February 7, 2022, Plaintiffs
Claudia Mendoza and Salvador Mendoza Maldonado filed this action against
Torrance Memorial Medical Center, Torrance Memorial Physicians Network,
Torrance Radiology Medical Group, Richard Huete, MD and Albert Grabb, MD based
on Defendants’ treatment of Claudia Mendoza for her pregnancy.  Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges (1) Negligence
(all Defendants); (2) negligence (against Torrance Memorial Physician Network
and Torrance Radiology).
LEGAL AUTHORITY
            The elements of a medical
malpractice cause of action are (1) the duty of the professional to use such
skill, prudence, and diligence as other members of his profession commonly
possess and exercise; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a proximate causal
connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting injury; and (4)
actual loss or damage resulting from the professional's negligence.  (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical
Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 468 fn 2.)  
            The standard of skill, knowledge and
care prevailing in a medical community is ordinarily a matter within the
knowledge of experts.  (Jambazian v.
Borden (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 836, 844.) 
“The standard of care for physicians is the reasonable degree of skill,
knowledge and care ordinarily possessed and exercised by members of the medical
profession under similar circumstances. 
The test for determining familiarity with the standard of care is
knowledge of similar conditions. 
Geographical location may be a factor considered in making that determination,
but, by itself, does not provide a practical basis for measuring similar
circumstances.”  (Avivi v. Centro
Medico Urgente Medical Center, supra, at 159 Cal.App.4th at 470.)
            Whether the standard of care in the
community has been breached presents a basic issue of fact in a malpractice
action which can only be proved by expert opinion testimony unless the medical
question is within the common knowledge of laypersons.  (Id. at 470, fn. 1; 1 Witkin, Cal.

“[A]n opinion unsupported by reasons or explanations does not establish
the absence of a material fact issue for trial, as required for summary
judgment.”  (Golden Eagle Refinery
Co., Inc. v. Associated Intern. Ins. Co. (2001) 85 Cal.App.4th 1300, 1315
(citing Kelley v. Trunk (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 519, 524).  Accordingly, where a plaintiff provides
proper opposing expert testimony via a declaration, a triable issue of material
fact is raised which precludes summary judgment.  (Jambazian, supra, 25 Cal.App.4th at
844.)  The absence of opinion evidence on
this issue is fatal to the plaintiff’s cause of action.  (Willard v. Hagemeister (1981) 121
Cal.App.3d 406, 412.)  An expert
declaration is admissible as long as Defendants’ expert states in detail his
qualifications and the factual basis for his opinion.  (Kelley, supra, 66 Cal.App.4th
at 524.)  
            Expert testimony is also required to
establish the element of causation in a medical malpractice action.  “The law is well settled that in a personal
injury action causation must be proven within a reasonable medical probability
based on competent expert testimony. Mere possibility alone is insufficient to

Systems, Inc. (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 1108, 1118 (trial court properly
struck medical expert testimony on issue of causation where expert’s opinion
failed to provide a reasoned explanation regarding the etiology connecting
plaintiff’s infected subcutaneous tissue to the nidus inside peritoneal cavity
where retractor was retained).  
DISCUSSION
            The
court issued a tentative ruling on October 16, 2023 denying Defendants Radiology
and Grabb’s joint motion for summary judgment. 
The court found that Defendants satisfied their burden as moving parties
on the issues of breach and causation with the expert declarations of Drs. Roossin
and Grabb.  The court also found that
Plaintiffs raised a triable issue of material fact with the expert declaration
of Dr. Benson on the issues of breach and causation.  
            This
matter was continued from October 16, 2023 for supplemental briefing.  Specifically, the court continued the matter
so that evidentiary objections and supplemental briefing could be filed after
Dr. Benson’s deposition was taken.  
            On
January 16, 2024, Radiology and Grabb filed a supplemental reply and objections
to the declaration of Dr. Benson.  On
February 1, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a supplemental brief in opposition.  
            Defendants’
Evidentiary Objections to Benson Declaration
            Objection
Nos. 1-7—OVERRULE
            Defendants’
Supplemental Brief
            Defendants
argue they deposed Plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Benson, on December 19, 2023.  Defendants argue that Benson admitted at
deposition that she had information about this case and Plaintiffs’ theory of
liability prior to reviewing the medical records and forming her expert
opinion.  Defendants argue Benson’s
opinion was based on information that was not available to Grabb when he read
the radiology report.  Defendant argues
Benson did not replicate the viewing conditions of Grabb when she formed her
opinion.  Defendants argue Benson
therefore suffered from “hindsight bias” and her opinion violates the American
College of Radiology’s guidelines.  Defendants
argue Benson’s opinion should be excluded based on Evidence Code §803.  
            Defendants
argue Benson’s testimony regarding causation was also defective.  Defendants argue Benson mischaracterized Dr.
Huete’s deposition testimony.  Defendants
argue Huete testified that Grabb’s report was one of four factors he relied on
prescribing Misoprostol. Defendants argue Benson admitted that she could not
testify as to whether Grabb’s report played more than a 50% role in Huete’s
decision to prescribe Misoprostol.
            Plaintiff’s
Supplemental Brief in Opposition
            Plaintiffs
argue summary judgment must be denied. 
Plaintiffs argue they produced reliable expert testimony in the form of
Benson’s declaration that contradicts the declarations of defense expert Roossin.  Plaintiffs argue Benson’s opinion was based
on the relevant medical records and discovery, including Huete’s
deposition.  Plaintiff argues the
American College of Radiology’s guidelines do not require members to avoid
hindsight bias and only counsel the expert to make every effort to avoid being
influenced by hindsight and framing bias. 
Plaintiff argues there is no evidence that Benson did not avoid allowing
her knowledge of this case to influence her opinion.  Plaintiff argues Benson testifies that she
only relied on the medical records and discovery to form her expert
opinion.  Plaintiff argues Defendants’
objections based on bias do not go to the admissibility of Benson’s opinion but
to its weight.
            Plaintiff
argues Evidence Code §803 is not grounds to exclude Benson’s opinion.  Plaintiff argues the admissibility of
Benson’s opinion is based on Evidence Code §801.  Plaintiff argues Benson’s opinion is
admissible under Evidence Code §801 and any alleged hindsight bias goes to
probative value, not admissibility.  
            Plaintiff
argues Benson’s opinion on causation is also admissible and based on sufficient
foundation.  Plaintiff argues Huete
testified at deposition that he concluded Claudia was in the midst of an
abortion based on four factors, one of which was Grabb’s radiology report.  Plaintiff argues Benson’s opinion that Huete
would not have concluded that Claudia was in the midst of an abortion were it
not for Grabb’s report is admissible.  
            Plaintiff
argues Defendants misunderstand the law on causation in this context.  Plaintiffs argue they do not need to show
that Grabb’s report played a 51% role in Defendant Huete’s decision-making
process.  Plaintiffs argue they need only
demonstrate that Grabb’s report was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s
injuries.  Plaintiffs argue that Huete’s
admission that he relied on the Grabb report as one of four factors in
prescribing Misoprostol is sufficient to establish it was a substantial factor
in causing Plaintiffs’ injury. 
Plaintiffs argue a jury could reasonably infer that were it not for the Grabb
report and had the Grabb report accurately informed Huete that no abortion was
in progress, Huete would have come to a different conclusion on whether an
abortion was occurring and he would not have ordered misoprostol.
            Plaintiffs
argue Defendants’ arguments would also result in the inadmissibility of their
own expert’s declaration regarding causation. 
Plaintiffs argue, just as Benson allegedly does not know what percentage
or weight Huete gave to the Grabb report, defense expert Roossin likewise would
not have such knowledge.  
            Defendants’
Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED
            The
supplemental briefing does not change the court’s original tentative ruling to
deny.  If anything, the supplemental
briefing would support a finding that Defendants failed to meet their initial
burden on the issue of causation.
            Defendants
argue Benson admitted that she reviewed the pleadings and was familiar with
this case and Plaintiffs’ legal theory of malpractice before she reviewed
medical records and discovery to formulate her opinion.  This is not unusual practice for an expert in
medical malpractice cases.  The key issue
is what Benson based her expert opinion and Benson makes clear that she relied
on medical records and discovery in this case to form her opinion.  (Benson Dec., ¶¶5-12.)  As Plaintiffs correctly argue, any claim that
Benson suffered from bias, hindsight or otherwise, goes to the weight of the
evidence and Benson’s credibility, not admissibility.  The court is not allowed to consider
credibility on summary judgment.
            Evidence
Code §803 is also not grounds to exclude Benson’s testimony.  Section 803 provides, “[t]he court may, and
upon objection shall, exclude testimony in the form of an opinion that is in
whole or in part on matter that is not a proper basis for such an opinion.  In such case, the witness may, if there
remains a proper basis for his opinion after excluding from consideration the
matter determined to be improper.”  
            Defendants
fail to identify any improper matter upon which Benson based her opinion.  Benson admittedly reviewed the pleadings and
was aware of Plaintiffs’ theory of liability in this case, but again, Benson
has never stated that she based her opinion on the pleadings or Plaintiffs’
theory of liability.  
            Moreover,
Defendants’ position turns the burdens on summary judgment on their head.  The court is required to strictly construe
Defendants’ evidence and liberally construe Plaintiffs’ evidence, and any
doubts must be resolved in favor of denial. 
(Government Employees Ins. Co. v. Sup. Ct. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th
95, 100; Hamburg v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 497,
502.)  Plaintiff is entitled to all
favorable inferences that may reasonably be derived from Benson’s declaration.
(Hanson v. Grode (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 60, 609-610 (the trial court
erred in finding Plaintiff’s expert medical opinion lacked a factual basis -
summary judgment in favor of defendant reversed.) “[T]he rule [is] that ... we
liberally construe the declarations for the plaintiff's experts.” (Powell v.
Kleinman (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 112, 125-128 (summary judgment in favor of
defendant reversed - trial court erred in finding Plaintiff’s medical expert
opinion did not have a “detailed reasoned explanation” rejecting the application
of that requirement to expert declarations submitted in opposition to summary
judgment); Garrett v. Howmedica Osteonics Corp. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th
173, 189 (“a reasoned explanation required in an expert declaration filed in
opposition to a summary judgment motion need not be as detailed or extensive as
that required in expert testimony presented in support of a summary judgment
motion or at trial”).)  Defendants’
position would have the court strictly construe Plaintiffs’ evidence while
liberally construing their evidence, reversing the presumption favoring Plaintiff
on summary judgment.
            With
respect to Benson’s testimony regarding causation, the court agrees with
Plaintiffs’ assessment that Defendants’ objection to Benson’s causation
testimony would apply with equal force to defense expert Roossin’s causation
testimony.  The court also disagrees with
Defendants’ characterization of Plaintiffs’ burden on causation, i.e.
establishing that the Grabb report was 51% of the reason for Huete’s decision
to prescribe Misoprostol.  
            Based
on Plaintiffs’ allegations, there were at least three breaches of the standard
of care—(1) Grabb’s misreading of Claudia’s ultrasound and conclusion that an
abortion was likely in progress; (2) Huete’s conclusion that an abortion was in
progress; and (3) his decision to prescribe Misoprostol.  Defendants argue Plaintiffs must establish
with expert testimony that Huete’s decision to prescribe Misoprostol was more
than half based on the Grabb report. 
Defendants fail to establish that their expert, Roossin, is qualified as
an expert in Huete’s personal decision making process and what caused him to
ultimately decide to prescribe Misoprostol. 
While expert testimony regarding whether Huete’s personal decision
making process was within the standard of care would be proper, why exactly Huete
personally decided to prescribe Misoprostol to Plaintiff and how much weight he
accorded the Grabb report in doing so is not a matter of expert testimony.
            The
proper test for cases of negligence is whether “something…is a substantial
factor in bringing about an injury, damage, loss or harm.”  (Espinosa v. Little Co. of Mary Hospital
(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1304, 1313-1314.)  “While there is no judicially approved
definition of what is a substantial factor for causation purposes, it seems to
be something which is more than a slight, trivial, negligible, or theoretical
factor in producing a particular result.” 
(Id. at 1314.)  
            Moreover,
while causation must be established by expert testimony, it need not
necessarily be established by direct evidence. 
“Even where expert testimony is required…it may be circumstantial in
nature, and the jury is entitled to draw reasonable inferences from it in
finding the standard of care and in determining proximate cause.”  (Keen v. Prisinzano (1972) 23
Cal.App.3d 275, 280 (nonsuit based on lack of causation evidence reversed where
defendant testified that, had he read the X-ray properly, he would not have
chosen the treatment option he applied to plaintiff because that treatment
option would have more likely resulted in plaintiff’s injury).)  
            Huete
testified that he was 100% percent sure there was an abortion going on when he
treated Claudia, because “all the—the conditions that I mentioned
before, her early bleeding, her HCG, levels and her progesterone levels, and
the ultrasound report.”  (Plaintiffs’ Ex.
B, 57:24-25-58:1-2.)  Huete testified he
did not independently read the ultrasound image and relied entirely on Grabb’s
ultrasound report.  (Id. at 60:9-20.)  
            Based on Huete’s testimony and his
statement that his conclusion that an abortion was in progress was based on
“all” four factors—early bleeding, HCB levels, progesterone levels and the
ultrasound report—a jury could conclude based on Huete’s direct evidence
regarding his own decision making process that Grabb’s ultrasound report was a
“substantial factor,” i.e. more than a trivial or negligible factor, in
determining that an abortion was in progress, Huete’s decision to prescribe
Misoprostol and Plaintiffs’ injuries.  
            Defendants’ Motion for Summary
Judgement is denied.  The prior tentative
ruling issued on October 16, 2023 is incorporated in full into this order.          
ORDER
            Defendants
Radiology and Grabb’s Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.

Moving
Party:             Joinder
by Torrance Memorial Physicians Network (“Physicians”)
Responding
Party:       Plaintiffs Claudia Mendoza
and Sav
Joinder
by Torrance Memorial Physicians Network to Defendant Ricardo Huete, MD’s Motion
for Summary Judgment
            The court considered the Notice of
Joinder.  
RULING
            Defendant Physician’s Joinder to Defendant
Ricardo Huete’s Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.  No such motion has been filed.  
BACKGROUND
            Plaintiff Claudia Mendoza underwent
an ultrasound for her pregnancy on July 21, 2020, as ordered by
Defendants.  Defendant Albert Grabb, MD
read the ultrasound that day and reported that the images suggested there was
an abortion in progress.  Defendant
Ricardo Huete, MD thereafter prescribed Misoprostol to Claudia and directed her
to take it to help purge the alleged dead fetus.  
            Thereafter, another ultrasound was
performed by Defendants that revealed evidence of a fetal heartbeat.[2]  As a result of these acts, Claudia alleges
she was forced to undergo a hysterectomy. 

            On February 7, 2022, Plaintiffs
Claudia Mendoza and Salvador Mendoza filed this action against Torrance Memorial
Medical Center, Torrance Memorial Physicians Network, Torrance Radiology
Medical Group, Richard Huete, MD and Albert Grabb, MD based on Defendants’
treatment of Claudia Mendoza for her pregnancy. 
Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges (1) Negligence (all Defendants); (2)
negligence (against Torrance Memorial Physician Network and Torrance
Radiology).
DISCUSSION
            On
December 21, 2023, Defendant Torrance Memorial Physicians Network (“Physicians”)
filed a “Notice of Joinder and Joinder by Defendant Torrance Memorial
Physicians Network to Defendant Ricardo Huete, M.D.’s Motion for Summary
Judgment Memorandum of Points and Authorities.” 
Physicians’ Notice of Joinder and MP&As clearly indicate it is
joining in Huete’s Motion for Summary Judgment, not TMMC’s Motion for Summary
Judgment or Radiology and Grabb’s joint Motion for Summary Judgment.  Defnedant TMMC’s Notice of Motion for Summary
Judgement only identifies TMMC as a moving party, not Huete, and the body of
the motion only refers to TMMC.  Based on
the court’s review of the docket, Defendant Ricardo Huete did not file any
motion for summary judgment.  As such,
there is no motion for summary judgment to which Physicians’ can join. 
            On
January 23, 2024, Plaintiffs responded to Physicians’ Joinder with an “Opposition
to the Motions for Summary Judgment of Defendants Torrance Medical Physicians
Network and Ricardo Huete, M.D.”. 
Plaintiffs’ Opposition is disregarded for the same reason Physicians’
Joinder is denied.  There is no Motion
for Summary Judgment filed by Huete in the record.  
            On
March 7, 2023, a document entitled “Reply by Defendants Ricardo Huete, MD and
Torrance Memorial Physicians Network to the Opposition to Defendants’ Motion
for Summary Judgment.”  The document references
“Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment.” 
However, the only summary judgment motion filed by multiple Defendants
was by Radiology and Grabb, and it is clear that neither Huete nor Physicians
joined that joint Motion for Summary Judgment. 

            ORDER
            Defendant
Physicians’ Joinder to Defendant Huete’s Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.
            Moving
party is ordered to give notice of ruling.
