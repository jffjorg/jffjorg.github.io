Summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge is considering a motion by cross-defendant Erik Goodrich to amend his answer to the cross-complaint. The motion seeks to add three affirmative defenses to the answer, including the argument that the contractual indemnity provision in the release is invalid, procedurally and substantively unconscionable, and contrary to public policy. The Judge grants the motion, finding that the amendment is timely and will not prejudice the opposing party. The Judge notes that the parties have been aware of the specific equitable defense theories being pursued for years, and there is no prejudice warranting denial of leave to amend. The Judge orders cross-defendant to efile a signed copy of the First Amended Answer on or before close of business on July 5, 2023.
