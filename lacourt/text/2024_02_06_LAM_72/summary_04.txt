And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mario Vasquez Gallegos vs. Mrs. Gooch's Natural Food Markets, Inc. d/b/a Whole Foods Market. The case concerns Plaintiff's employment relationship with Defendant and Defendant's termination of Plaintiff's employment. The Judge has sustained Defendant's demurrer to the eighth cause of action (wrongful termination in violation of public policy) without leave to amend, and has granted Defendant's motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages and related allegations with leave to amend.

The Judge's ruling is based on the following reasons:

* The eighth cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy is subject to the 2-year statute of limitations for common-law torts, and Plaintiff has not shown that it is possible to cure this defect by amendment.
* The prayer for punitive damages and related allegations is defective because it does not state facts that actually show malice, oppression, or fraud, and does not identify the officers who allegedly performed that conduct.

The Judge has given Plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint with respect to the punitive damages claim, and has set a hearing date of February 6, 2024.
