 Calendar Number:  9



 
 
 
Defendant Mrs. Gooch’s Natural Food Markets, Inc. d/b/a
Whole Foods Market (“Defendant”) demurs to the eighth cause of action in the
Complaint filed by Plaintiff Mario Vasquez Gallegos (“Plaintiff”). Defendant
also moves to strike Plaintiff’s prayer for punitive damages and related
allegations.
 
The Court SUSTAINS Defendant’s demurrer as to the eighth
cause of action WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.
 
The Court GRANTS Defendant’s motion to strike WITH LEAVE TO
AMEND.  Plaintiff may amend the complaint
with respect to the punitive damages claim within 20 days of this order.
 
Background
 
This action concerns Plaintiff’s employment relationship
with Defendant. The following facts are taken from the allegations in the
Complaint.
 
Defendant hired Plaintiff as a cook on September 21, 2012.
 
On June 26, 2020, Plaintiff tested positive for Covid-19.
Around June 28, 2020, Plaintiff’s health deteriorated because his oxygen levels
decreased, and Plaintiff was admitted to the hospital and placed on a
ventilator. Plaintiff’s breathing was impaired by Covid-19. Plaintiff was
discharged from the hospital on August 27, 2020. 
 
Plaintiff’s doctor instructed Plaintiff to undergo therapy
to regain Plaintiff’s ability to breathe and walk and placed on medical leave
until December 28, 2020. Plaintiff and his sister informed Defendant of these
developments.
 
On November 9, 2020, while Plaintiff was still on medical
leave and undergoing therapy, Defendant terminated Plaintiff’s employment.
 
Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant on November 9,
2023, alleging, among other things, wrongful termination in violation of public
policy.
 
Defendant demurred to the Complaint on December 28, 2023 and
concurrently filed a motion to strike. Plaintiff filed oppositions to each, and
Defendant replied to each opposition.
 
Legal Standard
 
Demurrer
 
As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects
must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial
notice. (Donabedian v. Mercury Ins.
Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) “A demurrer tests the pleading
alone, and not the evidence or facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants,
Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) The court assumes the truth
of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Ibid.) The only issue a demurrer is
concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of
action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.)
 
Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be
allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335,
348.) The burden is on the plaintiff to show the court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Ibid.;
Lewis v. YouTube, LLC (2015) 244 Cal.App.4th 118, 226.) However, “[i]f
there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause
of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist.
(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245).
 
Motion to Strike
 
The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its
discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or
improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436(a).) The
court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in
conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 436(b).) The grounds for a motion to strike are that the
pleading has irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or
filed in conformity with laws. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436.) The grounds for moving
to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437.)
 
Discussion
 
Statute of Limitations
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s claim for wrongful
termination in violation of public policy is barred by the 2-year statute of limitations
for common-law torts. Plaintiff  does not
deny that a 2-year statute would bar his claim. 
Plaintiff argues, however, that he timely filed his claim within FEHA’s
3-year statute of limitations.
 
“[W]hen a plaintiff relies upon a statutory prohibition to
support a common law cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of
public policy, the common law claim is subject to statutory limitations
affecting the nature and scope of the statutory prohibition, but the common law
claim is not subject to statutory procedural limitations affecting only the
availability and scope of nonexclusive statutory remedies.” (Stevenson v.
Superior Court (1997) 16 Cal.4th 880, 904.) Accordingly, “the two-year
statute of limitations under Code of Civil Procedure section 335.1 applies to a
common law tort cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of FEHA's
public policy against disability discrimination.” (Prue v. Brady Co./San
Diego, Inc. (2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1367, 1382.)
 
Plaintiff’s eighth cause of action for wrongful termination
is pled under the common law; Plaintiff has separately pled FEHA claims for
discriminatory and retaliatory termination. However, because Plaintiff’s
wrongful termination cause of action is itself a common law tort claim, albeit
based in a statutory right, it is subject to the two-year tort statute of
limitations.
 
This defect in Plaintiff’s claim could not be cured by
amendment. The Court therefore sustains the demurrer without leave to amend.
 
Motion to Strike
 
Punitive damages are appropriate when a defendant acted with
malice, oppression, or fraud. (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a).) “In order to
survive a motion to strike an allegation of punitive damages, the ultimate
facts showing an entitlement to such relief must be pled by a plaintiff.” (Clauson
v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255.) “In passing on the
correctness of a ruling on a motion to strike, judges read allegations of a
pleading subject to a motion to strike as a whole, all parts in their context,
and assume their truth.” (Ibid.) “In ruling on a motion to strike,
courts do not read allegations in isolation.” (Ibid.)
 
Here, Plaintiff makes general allegations that Defendant’s
officers acted with malice, oppression, or fraud, but these allegations are
merely conclusory – they do not state facts that actually show such malice
oppression, or fraud, nor do they identify the officers that allegedly
performed that conduct.
 
The Court therefore grants the motion to strike with leave
to amend.
