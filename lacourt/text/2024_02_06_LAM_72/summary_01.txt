Summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the City of Los Angeles to the Second Amended Complaint of Plaintiff Lynn Moses. The Court sustains the demurrer without leave to amend as to the first, second, third, and fourth causes of action, finding that the plaintiff has not identified a statutory basis on which the City can be held liable for Dawson's torts. The Court requests argument on the fifth cause of action for malicious prosecution, as it is unclear what role the City played in the restraining order action and whether Dawson was acting in the scope of his employment when he prosecuted the action.
