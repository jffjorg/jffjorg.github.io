And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in response to Plaintiff Richard Rodger Furton's motion to strike Defendant Mohammad R. Talai-Shahir's answer or, in the alternative, impose issue, evidentiary, and monetary sanctions. The judge finds that Defendant failed to comply with the court's order to serve responses to Plaintiff's supplemental discovery requests and that this failure constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. However, the judge does not find that the failure warrants terminating sanctions, as it has not unduly prejudiced Plaintiff or rendered Plaintiff unable to prove his case. Instead, the judge orders Defendant to serve responses to the discovery requests within 5 days and grants Plaintiff monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,060. The judge also denies Plaintiff's request for issue and evidence sanctions, finding that they are not tailored to the harm caused by Defendant's failure to respond to discovery.
