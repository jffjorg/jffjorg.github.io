defendants’ motion to quash service of
  summons and complaint
 



 
MOVING PARTIES:             Defendants Michele Morgan, Yannis
Yortsos, and Carol Folt      
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Jeffrey Ito
Motion to Quash Service of Summons and Complaint
The court
considered the moving, opposition, and reply papers filed in connection with
this motion. 
DISCUSSION
Defendants Michele Morgan (“Morgan”), Yannis Yortsos (“Yortsos”), and
Carol Folt (“Folt”) (collectively, “Defendants”) move the court for an order
quashing service of the summons and complaint by plaintiff Jeffrey Ito
(“Plaintiff”).
“A defendant, on or before the last day of his or her time to plead or
within any further time that the court may for good cause allow, may serve and
file a notice of motion for one or more of the following purposes: [¶] (1) To
quash service of summons on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the court
over him or her.”  (Code Civ. Proc., §¿418.10, subd. (a)(1).)  “When a defendant argues that service of
summons did not bring him or her within the trial court’s jurisdiction, the
plaintiff has ‘the burden of proving the facts that did give the court
jurisdiction, that is the facts requisite to an effective service.’”  (American Express Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011)
199 Cal.App.4th 383, 387.)
Defendants move for relief on the grounds that (1) Plaintiff has not
filed a proof of service establishing that defendants Yortsos and Folt have
been served, and the attempted service on those defendants on August 6, 2024
was invalid, and (2) the proof of service filed on August 13, 2024 as to
defendant Morgan is invalid and therefore insufficient to establish service on Morgan.
The court finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden to show that he
served Defendants with the summons and complaint.  (American Express Centurion Bank, supra,
199 Cal.App.4th at p. 387 [the plaintiff has the burden to prove the facts
requisite to an effective service].) 
First, the court finds that Defendants have submitted evidence showing
that Plaintiff has not served defendants Yortsos and Folt with the summons and
complaint in this action because the three summonses delivered to University of
Southern California’s Office of the General Counsel on August 6, 2024, while
identifying Morgan, Yortsos, and Folt in the “Notice to Defendant” section, each
stated that service was made “on behalf of . . . : University of Southern
California[,]” such that the summonses were directed only to, and served only
on, defendant University of Southern California, and not defendants Yortsos and
Folt.  (Hogoboom Decl., Ex. D, PDF. p,
78, SUM-100, ¶ 3, PDF p. 137, SUM-100, ¶ 3, PDF p. 168, SUM-100, ¶ 3; Hogoboom
Decl., ¶ 7 [“On August 6, 2024, Plaintiff delivered three identical copies of
his Summons and Complaint, all addressed to USC”].) 
Second, the court finds that Defendants have submitted evidence
showing that Plaintiff has not served defendant Morgan with the summons and
complaint. 
Plaintiff filed a proof of service as to Morgan on August 13, 2024,
which states that Morgan was served by substituted service by leaving copies of
the summons and complaint at University of Southern California on August 6,
2024.  (Aug. 13, 2024 Proof of Service,
¶¶ 2-3.)  However, as set forth above,
Defendants have shown that the three summonses left in University of Southern
California’s general counsel’s office on that date identified the entity being
served to be University of Southern California, not Morgan.  (Hogoboom Decl., Ex. D, PDF. p, 78, SUM-100,
¶ 3, PDF p. 137, SUM-100, ¶ 3, PDF p. 168, SUM-100, ¶ 3.) 
Third, the court acknowledges that Plaintiff has argued that he
substantially complied with the service requirements.  However, the court disagrees.  As set forth above, the summonses delivered
to University of Southern California did not name Defendants as the served
parties as required.  Thus, the court
cannot find that Plaintiff substantially complied with the service
requirements.  (Renoir v. Redstar
Corp. (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1134, 1153 [“When, as here, there is a
complete failure to comply with statutory requirements, there can be no
substantial compliance with those statutory or due process requirements”].) 
The court therefore grants Defendants’ motion.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10, subd. (a)(1).) 
ORDER
            The court grants defendants Michele
Morgan, Yannis Yortsos, and Carol Folt’s motion to quash service of summons.
            The court orders that the attempted
service of the summons and complaint in this action on defendants Michele
Morgan, Yannis Yortsos, and Carol Folt on August 6, 2024, is quashed. 
            The court orders defendants Michele
Morgan, Yannis Yortsos, and Carol Folt to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  November 25, 2024
