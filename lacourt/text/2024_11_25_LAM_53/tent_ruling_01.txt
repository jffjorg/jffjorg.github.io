  Order RE:
 
(1)  
  motion

(2)  
  motion
  to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff elizabeth tooley
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                Carpenter & Zuckerman      
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Unopposed
(1)  
Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Chance Brown
(2)  
Motion
to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Elizabeth Tooley 
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with each motion.[1]
 No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
Carpenter & Zuckerman (“Plaintiffs’ Counsel”) separately moves to
be relieved as counsel for (1) plaintiff Chance Brown (“Brown”), and (2)
plaintiff Elizabeth Tooley (“Tooley”) (collectively, “Plaintiffs”).  In the interest of judicial efficiency, the
court discusses Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s two motions together. 
The court notes the following defects with Plaintiffs’ Counsel’s
motions. 
First, although Plaintiffs’ Counsel has stated, in its declarations,
that Plaintiffs were personally served with copies of the motion papers filed
with the declaration, Plaintiffs’ Counsel (1) did not attach proofs of personal
service to the moving papers, and the proofs of service attached to the moving
papers establish only service by mail and electronic mail on parties other than
Plaintiffs, and (2) has not separately filed proofs of personal service on
Plaintiffs with the court.  (MC-052 as to
plaintiff Brown, ¶ 3, subd. (a)(1); MC-052 as to plaintiff Tooley, ¶ 3, subd.
(a)(1).)  
Second, even assuming that Plaintiff’s Counsel had filed proofs of
personal service establishing that Plaintiffs were served with the pending
motions on November 1, 2024 (i.e., the date that Plaintiffs’ Counsel filed the
pending motions), the court finds that such service would not have provided
Plaintiffs with sufficient notice of the hearing thereon. 
“[A]ll moving and supporting papers shall be served and filed at least
16 court days before the hearing.”  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).)  For a
hearing date of November 25, 2024, Plaintiffs’ Counsel was required to
personally serve Plaintiffs with the moving papers no later than October 31,
2024.[2]  Thus, to the extent that Plaintiffs’ Counsel
personally served Plaintiffs with the moving papers on November 1, 2024, that
would not have provided Plaintiffs with 16 court days’ notice of the hearing on
the pending motions as required.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
            The court therefore denies Carpenter
& Zuckerman’s (1) motion to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Chance
Brown, and (2) motion to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Elizabeth Tooley,
without prejudice to Carpenter & Zuckerman’s filing new motions to be
relieved as counsel for those plaintiffs that are accompanied by proofs of
service establishing that the clients have been served with the moving papers
within the time required by the Code of Civil Procedure.
            The court orders Carpenter &
Zuckerman to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
