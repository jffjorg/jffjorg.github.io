And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the defendants' motion to quash the service of summons and complaint. The defendants, Michele Morgan, Yannis Yortsos, and Carol Folt, argue that the plaintiff, Jeffrey Ito, failed to properly serve them with the summons and complaint. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not met his burden to show that he served the defendants with the summons and complaint. Specifically, the judge finds that the attempted service on defendants Yortsos and Folt on August 6, 2024, was invalid and that the proof of service filed on August 13, 2024, as to defendant Morgan is invalid and insufficient to establish service on Morgan. The judge also finds that the plaintiff did not substantially comply with the service requirements. Therefore, the court grants the defendants' motion and orders that the attempted service of the summons and complaint in this action on defendants Michele Morgan, Yannis Yortsos, and Carol Folt on August 6, 2024, is quashed.
