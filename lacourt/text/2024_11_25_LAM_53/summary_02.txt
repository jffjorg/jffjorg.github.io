And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court notes that the attorney's motion to be relieved as counsel for plaintiff Chance Brown was filed only 8 court days before the hearing, in violation of the Code of Civil Procedure's requirement that all moving and supporting papers must be filed at least 16 court days before the hearing. Although the court exercised its discretion to consider the declaration, it finds that the attorney has not shown that the declaration was served on the client within the required time. The court will consider this issue further at the hearing.
