court notes that counsel did not file the “Declaration in Support of Attorney’s
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel – Civil” as to the motion to be relieved as
counsel for plaintiff Chance Brown until November 13, 2024, only eight court
days before the hearing on the motion. 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1005, subd. (b) [all moving and supporting papers
must be filed at least 16 court days before the hearing].)  The court has exercised its discretion to
consider the declaration but finds, for the reasons set forth below, that counsel
has not shown that the declaration was served on the client within the time
required by the Code of Civil Procedure.
