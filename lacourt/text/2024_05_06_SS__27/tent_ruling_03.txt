The Court excuses
the personal appearance of Claimant and the guardian ad litem. Counsel may
appear by telephone or video conference call.
 
On March 27,
2024, the Court issued a minute order after reviewing Petitioner's prior
petition and denied the petition because Attachment 11b(6) and Form MC-355,
were missing and the Court found attorney’s fees in the amount of 25% to be
more reasonable and recommended Petitioner to file a new petition reflecting
that amount.
 
The Court examined the present petition and finds that Petitioner
has corrected the deficiencies noted above. Under the proposed settlement, the
gross settlement of $15,000 is set to be distributed as follows: $1490 will be
allocated for medical expenses, $3750 for attorneys' fees. The net balance of
$9760 will be awarded to Claimant.
 
The Court
reviews the settlement and finds it fair and reasonable. The Court
also finds the attorney’s fees fair
and reasonable. Based on the foregoing, the petition filed on 3/29/24 is
GRANTED.
 
The Court
sets an Order to Show Cause Re: Compliance on____________________ IN DEPARTMENT
SS-27 AT 8:30 AM.
