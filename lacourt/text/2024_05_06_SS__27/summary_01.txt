And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English:

The Court has denied the Plaintiffs' motion to compel Defendant to provide discovery responses. The Plaintiffs had served their first set of discovery requests on February 14, 2024, and the responses were due on March 19, 2024. However, the Court has determined that the Plaintiffs are not entitled as a matter of right to the Defendant's responses, as the responses were due after the discovery cut-off date. The Court has also denied the Plaintiffs' motion because the present discovery motions are scheduled to be heard after April 1, 2024, the discovery motion hearing cut-off date.
