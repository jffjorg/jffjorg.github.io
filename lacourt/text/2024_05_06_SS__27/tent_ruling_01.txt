ONE, FORM INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE, SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE, REQUESTS
FOR ADMISSIONS, SET ONE, AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS ARE DENIED.
 
On July 1, 2019, Plaintiffs filed the present
auto accident case against Cleverson Fernandes, who allegedly was driving
within the scope of employment for Ivory Heron Group. On January 30, 2024, the
Court granted Plaintiff's motion to reopen discovery, ordering the discovery
cut-off date to follow the previous trial date of April 16, 2024. On April 2,
2024, the Court continued the trial to July 15, 2024, but denied Plaintiff’s
application to reopen discovery. The current fact discovery cut-off date remained
March 17, 2024, and the last date to hear a discovery motion was April 1, 2024.
 
On February 14, 2024, Plaintiffs served their
first set of discovery responses on Defendant Ivory Heron Group. Defendant did
not provide any responses by the statutory deadline. Plaintiffs now move the
Court to compel Defendant to provide the discovery responses at issue.
Defendant filed an opposition, arguing that Plaintiffs had no right to compel discovery
responses that were due after the discovery cut-off date.
 
CCP § 2024.020(a) states that any party is
entitled as a matter of right to complete discovery proceedings on or before
the 30th day, and to have motions concerning discovery heard on or before the
15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the action. The trial
date to which the discovery cut-off dates are tied to is April 16, 2024. The
current fact discovery cut-off date was March 17, 2024, and the last date to
hear a discovery motion was April 1, 2024.
 
It is undisputed that on February 14, 2024, Plaintiffs
electronically served their first set of discovery requests on Defendant.
Defendant had 30 days (CCP § 2031.260(a)), plus 2 court days 1010.6(a)(4)(B) to respond, making the
discovery responses due by March 19, 2024. The due date for the discovery
responses or the date for completing discovery was thus after the discovery
cut-off date.  Therefore, Plaintiffs are
not entitled as a matter of right to Defendant’s responses to Plaintiffs’ first
set of discovery responses.  (Cal. Prac.
Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 8H-3 [8:1431]).
 
Moreover, the present discovery motions are scheduled
to be heard after April 1, 2024, the discovery motion hearing cut off date.
Thus, the present motions are DENIED.
