And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to reopen discovery and compel initial discovery responses. The plaintiff had filed a motion to compel discovery responses that were served in November 2022, but the defendant failed to provide the responses. The plaintiff then filed a motion to reopen discovery to align with the current trial date set for September 16, 2024. However, the judge found that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate diligence in seeking discovery or the timely hearing of a discovery motion. The judge also questioned whether the plaintiff's requested discovery would prevent the case from going to trial on the scheduled date or interfere with the trial calendar. Therefore, the judge denied the motion to reopen discovery and the motion to compel.
