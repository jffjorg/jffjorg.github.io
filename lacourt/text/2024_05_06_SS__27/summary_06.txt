And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted Plaintiff's Counsel Michael Domingo's motion to be relieved as counsel due to a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. The Court finds this to be proper grounds for withdrawal, citing case law. The motion was properly filed with the required Judicial Council forms and served on the client and parties. The Court grants the motion effective upon service on the Plaintiff. The Court notes that the next hearing is set for December 3, 2024, which should be sufficient time for the Plaintiff to retain new counsel. Alternatively, if the Plaintiff needs additional time to prepare for trial, they can seek a continuance of the trial.
