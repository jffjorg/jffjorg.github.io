```

And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant, Whole Foods Market Group, has moved for summary judgment in this premises liability case, arguing that there is no evidence to support the plaintiff's allegation that an uneven concrete surface caused her to trip and fall. After reviewing the evidence, I have concluded that the plaintiff has failed to introduce any evidence beyond her own uncorroborated, speculative, and self-serving testimony. The plaintiff's own testimony that she felt an uneven surface might have caused her to fall is mere conjecture and is "legally insufficient to defeat summary judgment." Therefore, I am granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment on both premises liability and negligence.
