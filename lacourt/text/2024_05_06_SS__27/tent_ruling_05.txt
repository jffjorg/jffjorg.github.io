 Case Number:  22STCV16181    Hearing Date:   May 6, 2024    Dept:  27 HON. LEE  S. ARIAN DEPARTMENT  27 TENTATIVE  RULING   Hearing Date:           5/6/2024 at 1:30 p.m. Case No./Name:       22STCV16181 PROCORO VAZQUEZ, et al. vs ANDREW  RENE BURCIAGA Motion:                    MOTIONS TO COMPEL FORM INTERROGATORIES SET  ONE, SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE, REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION, SET ONE, AND  REQUESTS FOR SANCTIONS Moving Party:           Defendant Andrew Rene Burciaga Responding Party:    Plaintiff Notice:                      Sufficient   Ruling:                    MOTIONS TO COMPEL FORM INTERROGATORIES SET  ONE, SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE, REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION, SET ONE, AND  REQUESTS FOR SANCTIONS ARE GRANTED   Background   On May 13, 2022, Plaintiffs filed the present  auto accident case. On January 31, 2024, the Court granted Plaintiff's counsel,  Lara Shapiro’s, motion to be relieved as counsel. Plaintiffs are now appearing  in this case on a pro per basis. On February 2, 2024, Defendant Andrew Burciaga  served his Form Interrogatories Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and  Requests for Production, Set One, on Plaintiff Margot Cordova.   Responses to Defendant's discovery requests  were due on March 7, 2024. On March 12, 2024, Defense counsel served Plaintiff  with a formal meet and confer letter, advising that Plaintiff’s responses were  overdue and requested verified responses by March 19, 2024. No responses have  been provided and now, Defendant moves the Court to compel responses. No  opposition has been filed.   Legal Standard   A motion to compel initial  discovery responses need only show that discovery was properly served on the  opposing party, the time to respond expired, and no response was served. (Leach  v. Sup. Ct. (1980) 111 Cal.App.3d 902, 905-06; CCP §§2030.290 2031.300.) A  motion to compel initial discovery responses need not show good cause, meeting  and conferring, or timely filing, and need not be accompanied by a separate  statement. (Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pac. Healthcare  Consultants (2007) 148 Cal. App. 4th 390, 404.) Analysis   The  discovery requests were properly served. Plaintiff did not file an opposition  or any other filing indicating that discovery responses at issue have been  served before the hearing date for the present motions. Thus, Defendant’s  motions to compel are GRANTED. Plaintiff Margot Cordova is hereby ORDERED to  provide complete discovery responses to Defendant Andrew Burciaga’s Form  Interrogatories Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Requests for  Production, Set One without objections within 20 days of today. Defendant seeks  sanctions in the amount of $310 per motion. Sanctions are generally mandatory  for discovery motions, and the Court finds the requested amount to be  reasonable.  Accordingly, it orders  Plaintiff to pay sanctions in the amount of $930 to Defendant within the next  30 days.   PLEASE TAKE NOTICE:   If a party  intends to submit on this tentative ruling, the party  must send an email to the court at sscdept27@lacourt.org with the  Subject line “SUBMIT” followed by the case number.  The body of  the email must include the hearing date and time, counsel’s contact  information, and the identity of the party submitting.   Unless all parties  submit by email to this tentative ruling, the parties should arrange to appear  remotely (encouraged) or in person for oral argument.  You should  assume that others may appear at the hearing to argue.   If the  parties neither submit nor appear at hearing, the Court may take the motion off  calendar or adopt the tentative ruling as the order of the Court.  After the  Court has issued a tentative ruling, the Court may prohibit the withdrawal of  the subject motion without leave.
