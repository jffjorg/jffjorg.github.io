And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's responses to the request for production of documents. The defendant had served unverified objections to each of the requests, and despite agreeing to provide supplemental responses, failed to do so. The judge finds that the defendant's actions constitute a misuse of the discovery process and is ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiff's counsel fees in the amount of $1,560.00. The judge also notes that the defendant's objections were served six days past the 30-day deadline to respond, without evidence of an extension being granted.
