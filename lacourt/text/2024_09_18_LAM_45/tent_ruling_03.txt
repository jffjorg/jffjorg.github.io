Background
            Hyung
Bai Lee (Plaintiff) filed a Complaint on June 1, 2023 alleging six causes of
action against their former employer SBJS Properties, Inc. (Defendant).
Plaintiff alleges that they were hired on January 1, 2007, and terminated on or
about September 10, 2022. Plaintiff alleges during their employ with Defendant
that Defendant failed to pay overtime, failed to provide meal and rest periods,
and failed to timely pay final wages upon termination. 
            The
motion now before the Court is Plaintiff’s Motion for an Order Compelling
Defendant’s Responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set 1 (the
Motion). 
Discussion
Legal Standard
“If a party to whom a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely
response to it, the following rules shall apply: (a) The party to whom the
demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any
objection to the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection
for work product under Chapter 4…(b) The party making the demand may move for
an order compelling response to the demand. (c) Except as provided in
subdivision (d), the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to a demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling, unless it finds that the one subject
to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” (CCP § 2031.300)
“The court may impose a monetary sanction
ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any
attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney's fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.” (CCP §
2023.030(a).) “Misuses of the discovery process include, but are not limited
to, the following: (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method
of discovery.” (CCP § 2023.010)
 
Analysis
            On
October 9, 2023, Plaintiff served Defendant with discovery which included
Requests for Production of Documents, Set 1. (Declaration of Elizabeth Votra,
hereinafter, Votra Decl., ¶2.) On November 14, Defendant served unverified
objections to each and every Request for Production of Documents. Plaintiff
contends that after receiving these objections and meeting and conferring,
Defense counsel agreed to provide supplemental responses by January 26, 2024,
however no supplemental responses for the Request for Production of Documents
came. (Moving Papers, 2:22-23.)
            The
moving papers contend Defendant’s unverified wall-to-wall objections are
meritless and unverified responses are tantamount to no responses at all,
citing to Appleton v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636. 
            First,
in order to challenge the merit of objections, Plaintiff would need to file a
Motion to Compel Further, with a separate statement explaining why the
objections lack merit. Second, if a party submits objections, the objections
need not be verified. (See Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Superior Court
(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 651, 656 [“The objections themselves do not
require a verification in order to be preserved…The statutes reflect the
recognition that objections are legal conclusions interposed by counsel, not
factual assertions by a party, making their verification unnecessary.”]
            However,
the Court notes the objections were served six days past the 30-deadline to
respond, with no evidence of an extension ever being granted to Defendant for
the initial responses. Therefore, Plaintiff’s Motion shall be granted, and
sanctions are warranted. 
Sanctions
            Plaintiff’s
counsel provides the following calculations:
·        
Counsel’s hourly rate is $500.00
·        
Counsel spent 3 hours preparing the
instant Motion
·        
Counsel anticipated three hours
drafting a reply and attending the hearing
·        
Counsel incurred a $60.00 filing
fee
·        
Counsel requests a total of
$3,060.00
Considering no opposition nor reply was
filed, the Court will impose sanctions against Defendant and award them to
Plaintiff in the amount of $1,560.00.
Conclusion
            Plaintiff’s
Motion for an Order Compelling Defendant’s Responses to Request for Production
of Documents is GRANTED. The Court will impose sanctions against
Defendant and award them to Plaintiff in the amount of $1,560.00, due
within ten days from the date of this order.
