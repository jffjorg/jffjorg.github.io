And here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The court has made a tentative ruling on a motion to compel compliance with a deposition subpoena. The subpoena was served on January 26, 2024, and ordered the production of business records by February 26, 2024. The subpoena demanded three categories of documents related to professional psychological treatment rendered to Plaintiff Shaila Mantri. The court has granted the motion, but limited the request to November 2020 to January 2021. The court has ordered Dr. Monica Weil, the third-party witness, to comply with the subpoena and produce the requested records. The court has also noted that Plaintiff Shaila Mantri's right to privacy with respect to her medical records was waived when she identified Dr. Weil as a witness with respect to the damages sought in this lawsuit.
