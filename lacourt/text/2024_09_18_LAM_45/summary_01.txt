And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the pro hac vice application filed by Francis Malofiy, counsel for the plaintiffs. The application was denied because Malofiy was suspended for three months and one day in 2016 in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania regarding events in 2011 and has not been readmitted. The court also noted that Malofiy's involvement in the inspection of the subject house did not constitute the practicing of law, but that Malofiy's suspension and lack of readmission still rendered him ineligible for pro hac vice admission.
