And here is the summary in English text:

The court is considering a tentative ruling on a future hearing date of September 26, 2023. The case has been ongoing since December 6, 2022, when the court ordered a final status conference. The plaintiff has filed a witness list and exhibit list, but these were not joint filings. The court is concerned that the parties did not work together to submit the lists. The plaintiff has also submitted a request to continue the case, citing the recent hospitalization of their owner, Cruz, and the lack of communication with the defendant's new counsel. The court notes that the parties had previously attempted to settle the case but were unable to reach an agreement. The court also finds that discovery is not yet complete due to the defendant's failure to fully respond to discovery requests. The court will ask the defendant what efforts were made to work with the plaintiff regarding the final status conference. However, the court finds that the case is not ready for trial and will need to be vacated. The court is troubled that the parties did not take the final status conference order seriously.
