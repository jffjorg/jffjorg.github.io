## English Summary:

The judge has reviewed the materials submitted ahead of the scheduled final status conference and has determined that the case is not ready for trial.  

The plaintiff requests a continuance due to the recent hospitalization of their owner, Cruz, and the lack of communication from the defendant's new counsel.  The plaintiff also states that discovery is incomplete and a motion to compel discovery remains outstanding.

While the parties have engaged in settlement discussions, no agreement has been reached. The judge is concerned that neither party appears to have taken the previous order for a final status conference seriously. 

Therefore, the judge intends to vacate the current trial date and inquire about the defendant's efforts to collaborate with the plaintiff.
