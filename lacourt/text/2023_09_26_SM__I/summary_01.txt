The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 18SMCV00349, which was scheduled for a final status conference on September 26, 2023. The plaintiff had submitted a witness list and exhibit list, but the court is concerned that no joint efforts were made to submit these documents. The plaintiff has also requested a continuance due to the defendant's new counsel and the plaintiff's owner's recent hospitalization. The court notes that discovery is not yet complete and that the parties had previously agreed to explore settlement discussions. However, the court is troubled that no one appears to have taken the final status conference order seriously, and the case is not ready for trial. As a result, the court will likely vacate the trial date. The judge will ask the defendant about their efforts to work with the plaintiff regarding the final status conference, but it is clear that the case is not ready to proceed.
