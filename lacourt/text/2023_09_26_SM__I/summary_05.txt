And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is holding a final status conference in an unlawful detainer action where possession is still at issue. The court previously issued a Final Status Conference (FSC) order on September 11, 2023, warning that a lot of work was needed to comply with the FSC requirements and that if the requirements were not met, the case would not be deemed ready for trial. Despite the defendant's absence at the last hearing, the plaintiff provided notice. The court received the FSC materials on September 25, 2023, which appear to be unilateral, except for the lack of a jury verdict. The judge will inquire whether the parties really want to proceed with the trial and whether they want to have a jury trial. If the parties confirm that they want to proceed, the case will be considered ready for trial and will begin on October 2, 2023 at 10:30 am.
