And here is the English-text summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the current state of the case, an unlawful detainer action where possession is still at issue. The judge notes that the Final Status Conference (FSC) order was given on September 11, 2023, and warned that a lot of work needed to be done to comply with the FSC requirements. The judge received FSC materials from the plaintiff on September 25, 2023, including a joint exhibit list, witness list, jury instructions, and statement of the case. The judge expresses concern that the materials appear to be unilateral, but if the defendant has signed off, the case may be ready for trial. The judge intends to inquire about the parties' intentions regarding trial and jury, and will proceed with the trial if the parties agree. The judge sets the trial date for October 2, 2023 at 10:30 am.
