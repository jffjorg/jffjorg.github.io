 Case Number:  23SMCV03328    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2023    Dept:  I The matter is here for a final status conference.  This is an unlawful detainer action where
possession is still at issue.  The FSC
order was given on September 11, 2023. 
The court warned at that time that a lot of work needed to be done to
comply with the FSC requirements and that if the FSC requirements were not met,
the court would not deem the case ready for trial.  While defendant was not present at the last
hearing, plaintiff did give notice.  On
September 25, 2023, the court received the following FSC materials.  (1) “Joint” exhibit list (5 exhibits, all
from plaintiff, with no indication as to whether defendant has stipulated to
authenticity or admissibility).  (2)
“Joint” witness list (1 witness with an 30 minute estimate for direct and a 20
minute estimate for cross).  (3) “Joint”
jury instructions (but signed by plaintiff only). (4) “Joint” statement of the
case (not signed).
This appears to be unilateral, but if defendant has signed
off, then other than the lack of a jury verdict, the case seems ready for
trial.  Given that the parties anticipate
a 50 minute trial, the court will inquire whether the parties really insist
that the case go forward and whether the parties insist that there be a trial
by jury here.  That said, if these
documents are truly joint and if the parties do want to go forward, the case
does appear READY FOR TRIAL and will begin on October 2, 2023 at 10:30 am.
