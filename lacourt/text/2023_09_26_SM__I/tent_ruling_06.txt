 Case Number:  SC128454    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2023    Dept:  I The matter is here for a final status conference.  The parties have suggested that this is a
long cause matter.  The court notes that
there are no FSC materials filed. 
Accordingly, the court will inquire as to whether that is because the
parties have settled (which would be a good answer) or because the parties
elected to ignore the FSC requirements (which would be a less good
answer).  In either case, the matter is
NOT READY FOR TRIAL.  The trial date will be VACATED.  The court will hold a new TSC on October 2, 2023 at 8:30.
