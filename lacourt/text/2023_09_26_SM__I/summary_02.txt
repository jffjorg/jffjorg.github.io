And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the ex parte application to advance the hearing date. The application is denied due to the Court's dark period between October 16, 2023 and November 1, 2023, which makes the dates suggested by the defendant unsuitable. However, the Judge will inquire about a solution to the scheduling conflict, taking into account the defendant's point that responses cannot be readily served before the hearing because the defendant may not be able to sign them. The Judge will also ask about the plaintiff's concerns about a response date in late November being prejudicial. The Judge may be able to move the hearing date up slightly, but not significantly, and is unsure about the materiality of the issue. Finally, the Judge will inquire about whether defense counsel expects any opposition to the motion to withdraw.
