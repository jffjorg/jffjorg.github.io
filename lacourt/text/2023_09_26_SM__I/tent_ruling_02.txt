 Case Number:  22SMCV02357    Hearing Date:   September 26, 2023    Dept:  I The ex parte application to advance the hearing is
DENIED.  The court will be dark between
October 16, 2023 and November 1, 2023, so the dates defendant suggests do not
work.
The court will inquired, though, as to a solution.  Defendant has a good point that the responses
cannot readily be served until the motion is heard because defendant might not
be able to sign the responses.  The court
will inquire as to why plaintiff believes that a response date in late November
will be prejudicial to it.
The court might be able to move the hearing date up
slightly, but not a lot and the court fails to see the materiality of it. 
The court will also inquire as to whether defense counsel
expects there to be any opposition to the motion to withdraw.
