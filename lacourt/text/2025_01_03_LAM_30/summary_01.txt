And here is a summary of the tentatively ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled that Cross-Defendants' motion to strike portions of Cross-Complainant's cross complaint is granted. Cross-Complainant is seeking punitive damages for professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty, but the court finds that they have not pled facts which support punitive damages. The court concludes that Cross-Complainant's allegations of negligent conduct, rather than despicable conduct, do not justify a punitive damages award. The court grants Cross-Complainant 15 days to amend their pleading to support their request for punitive damages.
