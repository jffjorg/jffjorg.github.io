And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the Defendant RVM's motion to continue the trial without prejudice for procedural reasons. The motion is denied because RVM failed to serve all parties, including Lewis, and because RVM has not filed an answer to the complaint. The Court must consider all the facts and circumstances relevant to the determination of the motion, including the proximity of the trial date, whether there was any previous continuance, and whether the continuance requested is reasonable. The Court has considered all these factors and has decided to deny the motion. The moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
