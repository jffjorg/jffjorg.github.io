And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling in this case is that the Pedram Defendants do not have standing to seek an order striking the allegations in the verified First Amendment Complaint (VFAC) made on information and belief as to Blumenfeld's relationship with Mason. The Judge notes that the allegations in the VFAC are based on Blumenfeld's "information and belief", but that the Pedram Defendants have not shown any authority that would allow them to stand in Mason's shoes and request the striking of allegations in the VFAC related to Mason. The Judge also notes that the allegations in the VFAC related to Blumenfeld's claims against the Pedram Defendants may be predicated on Blumenfeld's information and belief without running afoul of Code of Civil Procedure Section 446.
