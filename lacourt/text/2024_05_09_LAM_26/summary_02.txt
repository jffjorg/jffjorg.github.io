The Court has considered the Plaintiff's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and has denied the motion. The Court finds that the motion is premature and substantively improper. The Plaintiff sought to obtain a judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the Defendant's failure to file an answer or demurrer constitutes a waiver. However, the Court finds that the Defendant's demurrer is pending, and the Plaintiff's motion is premature. The Court also finds that the Plaintiff's motion is substantively improper because it seeks judgment on the pleadings on grounds that are not applicable in this case.
