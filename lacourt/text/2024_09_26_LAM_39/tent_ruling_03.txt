               [1]On
September 20, 2024, a day after their reply brief was due, Defendants filed a
document entitled “Notice of Motion for Extension of Time for Defendants Reply
to Plaintiff’s Opposition to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss” and noticed it for
hearing on January 6, 2025.  Such a
request is both improper and untimely. 
The Court construes the filing as an application seeking the same relief
and denies it..
