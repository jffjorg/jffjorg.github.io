And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, Jane LA Doe and Jane MA Doe, in their motion to compel further responses to discovery requests from the defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District. The plaintiffs are seeking documents related to complaints of misconduct against an employee, Corey Hogan, who allegedly sexually abused them while they were students at the school district. The judge finds that the defendant's responses to the discovery requests are insufficient and that the defendant must produce documents that reflect complaints prior to the incidents of which the plaintiffs complain.

The judge also rejects the defendant's arguments that the California Public Records Act and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act preclude disclosure of the documents. The judge finds that these acts are not applicable to civil discovery and that the public interest in maintaining confidentiality does not outweigh the interest of justice in disclosing pertinent information.

The judge orders the plaintiffs to give notice of the ruling and to file proof of service of same. The judge also orders the defendant to produce the requested documents and to provide a privilege log if it withholds any documents based on the attorney-client privilege and attorney work product protection.
