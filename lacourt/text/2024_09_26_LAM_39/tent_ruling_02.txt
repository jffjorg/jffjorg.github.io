MOTION
Defendants
Nicholas Phipps White (“Nicholas”), Mirga Phipps White (“Mirga”), and the
Hollywood Land Development Company, LLC (“Hollywood Land Development Company,”
collectively, “Defendants”) move to dismiss Plaintiff 594 Mapleton LLC’s (“Plaintiff”)
complaint.  In their notice of motion, Defendants
cite no authority under which the Court could dismiss the complaint.  As such, the Court cannot grant this
relief.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1010; Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 3.1110(a); People v. American Surety Ins. Co. (1999)
75 Cal.App.4th 719, 726.)  The motion is
denied.  Defendants are to file
responsive pleadings within 30 days.[1]
The Court notes Mirga purports to represent
Nicholas and Hollywood Land Development Company.  Hollywood Land Development Company cannot
represent itself and must retain an attorney licensed to practice law.  (Gamet v. Blanchard (2001) 91 Cal.
App. 4th 1276, 1284, fn. 5.)  As such,
the Court strikes Hollywood Land Development Company’s as a party to this motion
to dismiss.  Further, Mirga cannot
represent Nicholas, as that would constitute an unauthorized practice of
law.  (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 6125.)  Nicholas must represent himself or retain a
licensed attorney to do so.
Plaintiff is ordered
to give notice of this order and to file proof of service of same.
