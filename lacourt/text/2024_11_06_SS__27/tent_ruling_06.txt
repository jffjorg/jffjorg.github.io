CASE NO./NAME: 23STCV13167 EDWIN ZEPEDA vs
CITY OF LOS ANGELES, et al. 
Moving Party: Defendant County of Los Angeles
Responding Party: Plaintiff 
Notice: Sufficient¿ 
 
Ruling: MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL AND ADVANCE
MSJ IS GRANTED 
 
On June 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed the present
case, with the trial date currently set for December 5, 2024. Defendant County
of Los Angeles moves to either continue the trial or advance the hearing for
its Motion for Summary Judgment (MSJ), currently set for May 9, 2025, so it may
be heard before the trial date.
 
Numerous appellate courts have held that a
trial court cannot refuse to consider a timely-filed motion for summary
judgment. "A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment motion
filed within the time limits of [Code of Civil Procedure] section 437c.
[Citation.] Local rules and practices may not be applied so as to prevent the
filing and hearing of such a motion." (Sentry Ins. Co. v. Superior
Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529); accord First State Inc. Co. v.
Superior Court (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 324, 330 [invalidating case management
order to the extent it precluded filing motions pursuant to section 437c]; Wells
Fargo Bank v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 918, 923 [local court
rule that "requires a party filing a complex summary judgment motion to
file the motion six months before the date set for trial is void and
unenforceable because it is inconsistent with section 437c"].) The Sentry
court observed: "We are sympathetic to the problems the trial courts
experience in calendaring and hearing the many motions for summary judgment.
However, the solution to these problems cannot rest in a refusal to hear timely
motions." (Sentry, supra, at p. 530.) 
Motions for Summary Judgment (MSJs) must be
served at least 105 days before trial, or 107 days if served electronically. (Cole
v. Superior Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.) Defendant served its MSJ
electronically on July 2, 2024, 156 days before trial. Therefore, the MSJ is
timely, and Defendant is entitled to a hearing on its motion prior to trial. No opposition is filed. Given that the trial date is currently set for December 5, 2024,
the Court cannot advance the MSJ hearing date to ensure it is heard at least 30
days prior to trial. Therefore, the Court grants a brief continuance of the
trial date to January 21,
2025, at 8:30 a.m. and advances the MSJ hearing to December 19, 2024, at 1:30 p.m.
All trial related dates will follow the new trial date.
