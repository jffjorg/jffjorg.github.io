CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV12346 MAYRA
NAVARRO-TORRES vs CITY OF LOS ANGELES et al.
Moving Party: Plaintiff
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: MOTION TO VACATE IS DENIED
 
On February 4,
2022, Plaintiff filed the present case. Plaintiff alleges that due to clerical
errors within her legal representation, the case was not assigned to the
handling attorney, resulting in the Summons and Complaint being unserved.
Consequently, the court dismissed the case in October 2023, and Plaintiff
allegedly did not receive notice of this dismissal. Nearly one year later, on
October 9, 2024, Plaintiff moved the Court for relief from this dismissal.
Under section 473(b), to qualify for statutory
relief, a party must seek relief "within a reasonable time, in no case
exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was
taken." (Code Civ. Proc., § 473, subd. (b); Rappleyea v. Campbell
(1994) 8 Cal.4th 975, 980.) Because Plaintiff filed this motion nearly a year
after the dismissal, section 473(b) relief is no longer available.
When the six-month
period has expired, a court may grant relief only on equitable grounds, such as
extrinsic mistake or extrinsic fraud, where exceptional circumstances are
demonstrated. (Olivera v. Grace (1942) 19 Cal.2d 570, 575-76.) To vacate
a judgment based on extrinsic mistake, a party must meet a three-part test: (1)
demonstrate a meritorious case; (2) provide a satisfactory excuse for not
defending the action; and (3) show diligence in seeking relief once the mistake
was discovered. (Rappleyea, supra, at p. 982, citing Stiles v. Wallis
(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 1143, 1147-48.)
Here, Plaintiff has not
satisfied the requirements of the three-part test for equitable relief. While
Plaintiff demonstrated diligence by seeking relief promptly after discovering
the dismissal, the other two factors have not been met. Specifically, Plaintiff
has not provided a sufficient excuse for failing to prosecute the case or to
ensure service of the Summons and Complaint. Although California courts favor
resolving cases on their merits, this policy primarily applies within the
six-month statutory period under section 473(b). Equitable relief beyond that
timeframe is strictly limited to extraordinary cases, reflecting a strong
policy favoring the finality of judgments (Rappleyea, supra, at pp.
981-982).
Equitable relief for
extrinsic mistake is generally unavailable when a party’s own negligence
results in the mistake. In Kramer v. Traditional Escrow, Inc. (2020) 56
Cal.App.5th 13, 29–30, the court held that "relief will be denied if the
complaining party's negligence permitted the fraud to be practiced or the
mistake to occur." Similarly, in Manson v. Kelley (2009) 176
Cal.App.4th 36, 47, the court emphasized that a defaulting party must exercise
reasonable care in managing their case.
As in Kramer,
procedural failures here led to dismissal without a decision on the merits. In Kramer,
the defendants failed to participate and to keep their address current,
resulting in a default judgment. In this case, Plaintiff’s counsel failed to
properly assign the case or ensure the Complaint was served, which led to the
dismissal. These facts indicate that the error was due to internal
mismanagement, not an external or extrinsic mistake.
Finally, Plaintiff has
not presented any argument or evidence showing that her case is meritorious, a
necessary element for obtaining equitable relief.
Thus, Plaintiff’s
motion to vacate the dismissal is denied.
