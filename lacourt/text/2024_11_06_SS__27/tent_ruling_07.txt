MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS 
Hearing Date: 11/6/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV31569 ERIC SMITH vs
LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT, et al.
Moving Party: Defendant City of Los Angeles 
Responding Party: Plaintiff 
Notice: Sufficient
 
Ruling: Granted
 
Background
On September 27, 2022,
Plaintiff filed his initial complaint. On August 16, 2023, Plaintiff amended
his complaint, alleging four causes of action: (1) assault and battery, (2)
negligence, (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress, and (4) malicious
prosecution, against the Los Angeles Police Department and the City of Los
Angeles. Paragraphs 25–28 of the First Amended Complaint (FAC) state that the
requirements of the Government Claims Act have been satisfied. Plaintiff also
attached a letter from a captain of the Los Angeles Police Department
acknowledging receipt of his complaint and indicating that an investigation was
conducted (Exhibit A to the FAC).
On May 17, 2024,
Defendant City filed a Demurrer to the FAC, relying on the declarations of
Deputy Clerk Michael Valdivia and Deputy City Attorney Emily Cohen to confirm
that Plaintiff never filed a claim for damages with the City. On June 18, 2024,
the Demurrer was heard by the court and overruled, as it relied on extrinsic
evidence without a request for judicial notice of the absence of a damages
claim.
Defendant now moves for
judgment on the pleadings. This time, Defendant requests that the court take
judicial notice of the declaration of Michael Valdivia, Deputy City Clerk for
the City of Los Angeles, which states that the City Clerk’s office has not received
any claim for damages from Plaintiff for an incident occurring in 2022.
Legal Standard¿¿ 
A defendant’s motion
for judgment on the pleadings may be made after the time to demur has expired
and an answer has been filed. (CCP § 438(f).) A motion by a defendant may be
made on the grounds that (1) the court “lacks jurisdiction of the subject of one
or more of the causes of action alleged” or (2) the complaint or
cross-complaint “does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action against that defendant.” (CCP § 438(c).)¿¿ 
“A motion for judgment
on the pleadings has the same function as a general demurrer, and hence attacks
only defects disclosed on the face of the pleadings or by matters that can be
judicially noticed.” (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 995, 999.) “A motion for judgment on the pleadings is akin to a
general demurrer; it tests the sufficiency of the complaint to state a cause of
action.” (Wise v. Pacific Gas and Elec. Co. (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 725,
738.)¿¿ 
              In a demurrer, a court
generally confines itself to the pleading but, as appropriate, may extend its
consideration to matters subject to judicial notice. “[W]hen the allegations of
the complaint contradict or are inconsistent with such facts, we accept the
latter and reject the former. We give the same precedence to facts evident from
exhibits attached to the pleading. (Hill v. Roll Internat. Corp. (2011)
195 Cal.App.4th 1295, 1300.)  Furthermore, any allegations that are
contrary to the law or to a fact of which judicial notice may be taken will be
treated as a nullity. (Interinsurance Exchange v. Narula (1995) 33
Cal.App.4th 1140, 1143; Fundin v. Chicago Pneumatic Tool Co. (1984) 152
Cal.App.3d 951, 955.)
Discussion
In the FAC, Plaintiff
alleges that the complaint was sent to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD).
(FAC ¶ 28.) This is supported by the letter from LAPD and undisputed by the
parties. The issue, therefore, is whether submitting a claim to LAPD satisfies
the requirements of the Government Claims Act—specifically, whether LAPD is the
correct entity to receive Plaintiff’s claim and whether a letter to LAPD
substantially complies with the Act’s claim presentation requirements.
First, L.A.M.C. Section
350(a) provides that no suit may be brought on any claim for money or damages
against the City, or any officer or board of the City, until a claim has been
filed with the City Clerk and rejected in whole or in part. Thus, it is the
City Clerk, not LAPD, that is designated as the responsible officer to receive
and act upon claims for damages made against the City of Los Angeles.
Second, while
"[t]he Government Claims Act requires only substantial compliance with the
claims presentation requirement” (Westcon Construction Corp. v. County of
Sacramento (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 183, 200), substantial compliance
requires that a misdirected claim be "actually received" by the
appropriate officer or board. Knapp v. Palisades Charter High School
explains that "[i]f a public employee has failed to fulfill a duty to
forward a misdirected claim to the appropriate party, such claim cannot be in substantial
compliance because it was not ‘actually received’ by the appropriate party.”
(141 Cal.App.4th 780, 790 (2006).) Additionally, Jamison v. State of
California clarifies that "where a claim is filed with the proper
entity, although with the wrong statutory official thereof, the doctrine of
substantial compliance will save the claim if the claim was actually received
by the statutory officer. [Citations.] But where there is a complete failure to
serve any responsible officer of the entity, the doctrine does not apply."
(31 Cal.App.3d 513, 517 (1973).)
Plaintiff’s allegations
in the FAC, along with the attached letter, confirm that the complaint was sent
to the LAPD, not to the City Clerk’s office—the responsible department for
handling such claims. Further, as indicated in the Valdivia declaration, the
City Clerk’s office did not receive any claims from Plaintiff in 2022.
Therefore, Plaintiff’s complaint was not forwarded to the appropriate statutory
officer. Accordingly, Plaintiff has not substantially complied with the
Government Claims Act’s presentation requirement.
Plaintiff filed an
opposition but does not dispute the substance of the motion, specifically that
he did not substantially comply with the statutory requirements of the
Government Claims Act. Instead, Plaintiff argues that motions for judgment on
the pleadings are governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 438, which only conditionally
allows for such motions on the same grounds after a demurrer has been overruled,
per section 438(g)(1). However, this section is not applicable here because the
demurrer was not overruled on the merits but rather due to a
technicality—namely, the lack of a request for judicial notice, which the
Defendant has now addressed in the current motion.
Plaintiff also contends
that the court cannot take judicial notice of the city clerk’s declaration. However,
under Fowler v. Howell (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1746, 1752, judicial notice
is permitted regarding the absence of a Government Claims Act filing, as
attested by a knowledgeable state employee. While the court may take judicial
notice of the existence or non-existence of a record, it cannot take notice of
the truth of its contents (Sosinsky v. Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548,
1565). Here, the court is solely taking judicial notice of the existence or
absence of Plaintiff's claims in the City Clerk’s records, as attested to by
Deputy City Clerk Michael Valdivia’s declaration.
Plaintiff alleges that
the incident in question occurred on April 20, 2022, making the deadline for
filing a government claim under California Government Code section 911.2(a)
October 20, 2022 (six months after the alleged incident). According to Government
Code section 911.2(a), a claim for personal injury or property damage against a
public entity must be presented within six months of the accrual of the cause
of action.
Further, while
California law allows for a "late claim" application within one year
after the accrual of the cause of action, Plaintiff did not file such an
application within the necessary timeframe. This one-year limit, mandated under
Government Code section 911.4(b), establishes that the late claim request must
be presented within one year from the date of the incident.
After one year, no
further relief is available, as the court is without jurisdiction to grant
relief on untimely claims. This principle is well-established under Greyhound
Lines, Inc. v. County of Santa Clara (1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 480, 488, where
the court held that the failure to file a timely claim or application for a
late claim under the Government Claims Act irrevocably bars the plaintiff from
pursuing their claim, as the court has no jurisdiction to grant relief under
Government Code section 946.6.
Here, Plaintiff’s claim
was neither presented within the six-month statutory period nor accompanied by
an application for late filing within one year of the incident. Consequently,
Plaintiff’s failure to meet these statutory requirements means that the claim
is time-barred, and the court lacks jurisdiction to grant any relief from these
deadlines. Thus, the motion is granted.
