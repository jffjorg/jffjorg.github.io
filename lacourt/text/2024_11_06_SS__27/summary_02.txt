And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of the case. The Plaintiff alleged that clerical errors in her legal representation led to the case not being assigned to the handling attorney, resulting in the Summons and Complaint not being served. The Plaintiff claims not to have received notice of the dismissal, which occurred nearly a year ago. However, the Judge found that the Plaintiff failed to meet the requirements for statutory relief under California Code of Civil Procedure, section 473(b), and that the Plaintiff's own negligence in managing her case led to the dismissal. Therefore, the Judge denied the motion to vacate the dismissal, citing the strong policy favoring the finality of judgments.
