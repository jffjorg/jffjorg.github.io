CASE NO./NAME: 20STCV43411 ROZBEH ROSS
MISSAGHI vs EQUINOX HOLDINGS, LLC, et al.  
Moving Party: Defendant Equinox Holdings, Inc. 
Responding Party: Plaintiff 
Notice: Sufficient¿ 
 
Ruling: MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL IS GRANTED 
 
On November 12, 2020, Plaintiff filed the
present case, with the trial date currently set for January 13, 2025. Defendant
Equinox Holdings, Inc. moves to either continue the trial or advance the
hearing for its Motion for Summary Judgment (MSJ), currently set for January
31, 2025, so it may be heard before the trial date. 
 
Numerous appellate courts have held that a
trial court cannot refuse to consider a timely-filed motion for summary
judgment. "A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment motion
filed within the time limits of [Code of Civil Procedure] section 437c.
[Citation.] Local rules and practices may not be applied so as to prevent the
filing and hearing of such a motion." (Sentry Ins. Co. v. Superior
Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529); accord First State Inc. Co. v.
Superior Court (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 324, 330 [invalidating case management
order to the extent it precluded filing motions pursuant to section 437c]; Wells
Fargo Bank v. Superior Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 918, 923 [local court
rule that "requires a party filing a complex summary judgment motion to
file the motion six months before the date set for trial is void and
unenforceable because it is inconsistent with section 437c"].) The Sentry
court observed: "We are sympathetic to the problems the trial courts
experience in calendaring and hearing the many motions for summary judgment.
However, the solution to these problems cannot rest in a refusal to hear timely
motions." (Sentry, supra, at p. 530.) 
 
Motions for Summary Judgment (MSJs) must be
served at least 105 days before trial, or 107 days if served electronically. (Cole
v. Superior Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.) Defendant served its MSJ
electronically on September 25, 2024, 110 days before trial. Therefore, the MSJ
is timely, and Defendant is entitled to a hearing on its motion prior to trial. 
 
The Court finds good cause to continue trial
to March 3, 2025, at 8:30
a.m.  The FSC will be continued to
February ______, 2025, at 10:00
a.m.  Because the need to hear the
MSJ prior to trial is the only basis provided for continuance, all pre-trial
dates, including discovery cut-off dates, remain tied to the original trial
date.  The parties may, of course,
stipulate to continue those dates consistent with the new trial date.
