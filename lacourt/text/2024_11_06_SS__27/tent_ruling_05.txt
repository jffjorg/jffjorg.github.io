 Case Number:  22STCV18667    Hearing Date:   November 6, 2024    Dept:  27 Hon. Lee S. Arian, Dept 27
 
MOTION TO COMPEL MENTAL EXAMINATION
Hearing Date: 11/6/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV18667 WILLIAM BLAINE
MCANENEY vs THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES
Moving Party: Defendant City of Long Beach
Responding Party: Plaintiff 
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: GRANTED 
 
The parties have met and conferred regarding
Plaintiff’s mental examination and have reached an agreement on conducting the
examination, including its scope, the specific tests to be performed, and the
duration of the examination. However, they disagree on two issues: (1) whether
the raw data from the examination should be released directly to Plaintiff’s
counsel or only to Plaintiff’s retained neuropsychologist, and (2) whether an
audio recording of the testing portion should be provided to Plaintiff’s
counsel or only to Plaintiff’s retained neuropsychologist.
 
In applying
CCP § 2032.310 and in balancing Plaintiff’s need for relevant information
against the protection of the integrity of the tests, the Court rules as
follows: 
 
1. Raw data
is to be provided to Plaintiff’s counsel for cross examination purposes and to
challenge Defendant’s expert’s conclusions but subject to a protective order,
requiring the materials to remain confidential and used solely for the purposes
of this case to obviate any concerns over production of raw data. 
 
Restricting
access to raw data solely to licensed neuropsychologists would force Plaintiff
to prematurely disclose their expert’s identity simply to access crucial data,
which could compromise Plaintiff’s litigation strategy. Allowing Plaintiff’s
counsel direct access ensures that they retain control over the timing of
expert disclosures, consistent with standard litigation practices where expert
identification is typically delayed until later stages of discovery.
Neuropsychologists are also costly to retain, creating a significant financial
barrier for plaintiffs with limited means. This burden is especially acute for
plaintiffs in pro per, who may lack any budget for expert witnesses and must
rely entirely on direct access to discovery materials to prepare their case.
Given these considerations, the Court finds that allowing Plaintiff’s counsel
access to the raw data outweighs any interest in limiting it exclusively to
another expert. The Court therefore orders that raw data from the testing
portion be provided directly to Plaintiff’s counsel, subject to a protective
order to maintain confidentiality and restrict its use to this case.
 
2. CCP § 2032.530(a) expressly permits the examinee
and/or the examiner to audio record the examination in its entirety; however,
it does not provide for or preclude the disclosure of such audio recordings.
The disclosure of such material remains within the sound discretion of the
trial court. (Randy's Trucking, Inc. v. Superior Court (2023) 91
Cal.App.5th 818, 835.) The Court, in its discretion, finds that the use of the
recordings for case preparation and cross-examination outweighs any interest in
having it released only to another expert and therefore orders audio recording
of the testing portion to be provided to Plaintiff’s counsel, also subject to a
protective order. 
 
Plaintiff is ordered to attend her
mental examination within 30 days of today, subject to the parties' agreement
and the Court’s ruling on the issues listed above.
