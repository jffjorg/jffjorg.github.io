And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendant's motion to either continue the trial or advance the hearing of its Motion for Summary Judgment (MSJ). The defendant's MSJ was filed electronically on July 2, 2024, and the trial date is currently set for December 5, 2024. The judge has granted a brief continuance of the trial date to January 21, 2025, and has advanced the MSJ hearing to December 19, 2024. The judge has also ruled that the defendant is entitled to a hearing on its MSJ prior to trial, despite the fact that the trial date is currently set for December 5, 2024. The judge's ruling is based on the fact that numerous appellate courts have held that a trial court cannot refuse to consider a timely-filed motion for summary judgment.
