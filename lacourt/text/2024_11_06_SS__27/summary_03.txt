The judge has granted the defendants' motion to compel initial responses to their discovery requests. The plaintiff, Michael Odjaghian, failed to respond to the defendants' supplemental interrogatories, requests for production, and requests for admission despite an agreed-upon extension of the deadline. The defendants attempted to communicate with the plaintiff's counsel multiple times, but the plaintiff has yet to provide any responses. The judge has ordered the plaintiff to serve complete, verified responses to the discovery requests within 20 days and has deemed the contents of the defendants' requests for admission admitted. Additionally, the judge has reduced the sanctions from $882.50 per motion to a total of $1,500, payable jointly and severally by the plaintiff and his attorney to the defendants within 20 days.
