```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion to continue the trial, which was filed by the defendants due to staffing issues at Wawanesa General Insurance, substantial discovery remaining, and defense counsel's unavailability in December due to personal commitments. The judge held that the substitution of attorney did not automatically establish good cause for a continuance, and that the case has been pending for over two and a half years, which is a long time for a straightforward auto accident case with standard discovery. The judge also noted that defense counsel's personal scheduling conflicts do not outweigh the court's obligation to manage its calendar efficiently and ensure timely resolution of cases.
