And here is a summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel a mental examination of the plaintiff, William Blaine McAneney, in a case against the City of Los Angeles. The defendant, the City of Long Beach, had filed the motion. The parties have agreed on the scope, tests, and duration of the examination, but disagree on whether raw data from the examination should be released directly to the plaintiff's counsel or only to the plaintiff's retained neuropsychologist, and whether an audio recording of the testing portion should be provided to the plaintiff's counsel or only to the plaintiff's retained neuropsychologist. The Court ruled that the raw data should be provided to the plaintiff's counsel, subject to a protective order, as it outweighs the interest in limiting it exclusively to another expert. The Court also ruled that the audio recording of the testing portion should be provided to the plaintiff's counsel, subject to a protective order, as it is necessary for the plaintiff's case preparation and cross-examination. The Court ordered the plaintiff to attend the mental examination within 30 days of the date of the tentative ruling.
