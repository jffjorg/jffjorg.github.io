MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL
Hearing Date: 11/6/24 
CASE NO./NAME: 22STCV15720 JASON FRANKLIN,
et al. vs PILEN GOMEZ, et al.
Moving Party: Defendant Pilen Gomez and Kevin Jablonski
Responding Party: Unopposed
Notice: Sufficient 
Ruling: DENIED
 
On May 11, 2022,
Plaintiff filed the present case, with trial currently set for December 5,
2024. On October 1, 2024, the parties filed a joint stipulation to continue the
trial, citing the following reasons:
1.  Due
to staffing issues, Wawanesa General Insurance transferred the case from its
in-house counsel to outside trial counsel, Gina Y. Kandarian-Stein, with the
substitution of attorney filed on August 27, 2024.
2.  Substantial
discovery remains, including Plaintiff’s deposition, medical record reviews, an
independent medical examination, and depositions of treating physicians and
experts.
3.  Defense
counsel, Gina Y. Kandarian-Stein, will be unavailable throughout December due
to pre-paid vacation plans and holiday commitments.
On October 1, 2024, the
Court previously denied the parties' stipulation to continue the trial, finding
insufficient good cause. Defendants have now filed the present motion,
restating the same arguments presented in the original stipulation and providing
no new basis for the Court to alter its prior decision.
First, substitution of
counsel, while noted, does not automatically establish good cause for a trial
continuance. New counsel inherits a case with all pre-existing deadlines and
obligations intact, and the substitution in this matter was finalized on August
27, 2024, providing ample time to prepare for the December 5, 2024 trial. The
Court presumes that parties accept representation with full awareness of the
case schedule, and substitution alone, particularly when several months remain
before trial, does not justify delay.
Second, this case was
filed on May 11, 2022, meaning it has been pending for over two and a half
years. Pursuant to CRC 3.714, the Court has a duty to promote timely resolution
and ensure civil cases conclude within two years where possible. This is a
straightforward auto accident case with standard discovery, which should have
been completed by this stage. 
Lastly, while personal
scheduling conflicts such as vacations and holidays are acknowledged, they are
not compelling legal grounds for a continuance. Defense counsel's
unavailability due to personal plans in December does not outweigh the Court’s
obligation to manage its calendar efficiently, especially given that the
substitution occurred well in advance, providing time for alternative
scheduling or coverage. Courts must balance respect for counsel’s personal
commitments with the paramount objective of resolving cases efficiently and
fairly within statutory guidelines.
Accordingly,
Defendants’ motion to continue trial is denied.
