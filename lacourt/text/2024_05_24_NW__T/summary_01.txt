And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion for evidence sanctions against the defendant, Puretek Corporation. The plaintiff, Adriana Soto, moved for evidence sanctions due to the defendant's failure to produce its Person Most Qualified (PMQ) as required by a court order from December 18, 2023. The defendant produced Jeff Pressman as its PMQ at the deposition, but the plaintiff argued that Jeff was not the proper PMQ and that the defendant had misused discovery by producing him as the PMQ. The court reviewed the plaintiff's motion and determined that the defendant had complied with the court order by producing its PMQ, and that the plaintiff had not shown a misuse of discovery. Therefore, the court denied the plaintiff's motion for evidence sanctions.
