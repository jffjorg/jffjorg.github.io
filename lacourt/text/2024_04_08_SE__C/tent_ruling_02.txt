 Case Number:  23NWCV0064    Hearing Date:   April 8, 2024    Dept:  C Enriquez
Materials & Quilting, Inc., vs Esperanza Padilla, et al., Case No.
23NWCV0064
This is a
breach of contract action. Plaintiff’s Counsel Debra Grimaila moves ex parte to
withdraw her legal representation of Plaintiff Enriquez Materials &
Quilting, Inc. or, in the alternative, for an order shortening time to provide
notice of the motion.  Counsel contends her working relationship with
Plaintiff has become so strained that she can no longer successfully prepare
this case for trial.
A motion to be
relieved as counsel is a noticed motion which must be made on a judicial
council form. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362(a).) Thus, the Court cannot
rule on the motion at this time.  Accordingly, Counsel’s ex parte
application is DENIED.  Alternatively, the Court specially sets a hearing
on the motion for May 7, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Dept. SE-C.  Counsel
is ordered to file and serve a properly noticed motion within the time period
prescribed by CCP § 1005.  
Counsel is
advised that the Court typically requires litigants to file noticed motions
after first making a reservation on the Court’s reservation system.  A
party may then seek ex parte relief if necessary.  
Plaintiff’s
Counsel to give notice.
