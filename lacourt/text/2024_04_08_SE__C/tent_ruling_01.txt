  Case Number:  21NWCV00400    Hearing Date:   April 8, 2024    Dept:  C The
Windmill Co. Inc. vs Fayek Sedrak, et al., Case No. 21NWCV00400
Plaintiff The
Windmill Co., Inc. applies ex parte for sanctions against Defendants for
failing to comply with the Court's January 3, 2024 order compelling the
deposition of John Soldat, Defendants' tax preparer.  Plaintiff argues it
needs to depose Soldat to obtain information necessary to support its motion
for reconsideration of the Court's January 29, 2024 ruling which granted
Defendant Sedrak's motion for summary judgment.  Plaintiff’s motion for
reconsideration is (scheduled for hearing on October 29, 2024.  In the
Court's ruling on Defendant Sedrak’s motion for summary judgment, the Court
found that Plaintiff failed to establish that Defendant Sedrak was the alter
ego of Defendant O&C Hillside.  At the hearing on the motion,
Plaintiff’s Counsel asked for a continuance to obtain additional
evidence.  The Court denied the request because it was not made on or
before the time the opposition was due.  (CCP § 437c(h).) Thus, it appears
Plaintiff is trying to obtain evidence in support of a motion for reconsideration
which it ought to have sought in opposition to Defendant Sedrak's motion for
summary judgment.  
While the
Soldat deposition may still be necessary to establish loss of profit for
purposes of trial, Plaintiff does not mention that as a reason in support of
its ex parte application.  Plaintiff only argues that Soldat's deposition
is required to support its motion for reconsideration.  Moreover,
Defendants point out that the January 3, 2024 order is not final because
Defendants have filed a motion to reconsider that ruling, which is (scheduled
for hearing on September 24, 2024.  Plaintiff has not moved to advance
that hearing date.  
Accordingly,
Plaintiff's ex parte application is DENIED.  Moving party to give
notice.
