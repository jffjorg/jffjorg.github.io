And here is the English summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Windmill Co., Inc. (Plaintiff) has applied ex parte for sanctions against Fayek Sedrak, et al. (Defendants) for failing to comply with the court's January 3, 2024 order compelling the deposition of John Soldat, Defendants' tax preparer. Plaintiff argues that it needs to depose Soldat to support its motion for reconsideration of the court's January 29, 2024 ruling, which granted summary judgment to Defendant Sedrak. However, the court finds that Plaintiff is trying to obtain evidence in support of a motion for reconsideration that it should have sought in opposition to Defendant Sedrak's motion for summary judgment. Additionally, the January 3, 2024 order is not final as Defendants have filed a motion to reconsider that ruling. Therefore, the court denies Plaintiff's ex parte application for sanctions.
