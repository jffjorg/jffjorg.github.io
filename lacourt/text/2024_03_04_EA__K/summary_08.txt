And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in a case involving Guadalupe Payan, who is seeking to appoint the court clerk to sign a grant deed transferring title to a property to her. The property was originally owned by Guadalupe and her late husband, and was transferred to a trust. Guadalupe's daughter, Patricia Garrett, has listed the property for sale.

The judge's tentative ruling notes that Guadalupe did not understand the document she signed in English, which transferred the property to Patricia, and that Guadalupe speaks and reads Spanish. The judge is inclined to continue the hearing to allow for clarification on the execution of the grant deed.

The judge has also reviewed Patricia's opposition to Guadalupe's motion, which requests that both parties execute the deeds required under the Settlement Agreement. The judge notes that Patricia cannot request affirmative relief in her opposition, but suggests that the parties may be willing to informally resolve the motion by executing the deeds and delivering them to the court. The judge will hear further from the parties at the time of the hearing.
