And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the insurance policy provisions and has determined that any policy issued in the state must contain specific provisions to protect against insolvency/bankruptcy and allow judgment creditors to recover on judgments. Specifically, the policy must include a provision stating that insolvency/bankruptcy of the insured will not release the insurer from payment of damages, and that judgment creditors can bring an action against the insurer to recover on a judgment secured against the insured. The judge is requiring these provisions to ensure that insurance policies are fair and protect all parties involved.
