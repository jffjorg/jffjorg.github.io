And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Yong Qi's motion to compel arbitration and stay court action. The case is based on a written purchase agreement for the sale of real property, which was entered into on October 8, 2022. Defendant Qi sought to renegotiate the purchase price, which was rejected by Plaintiffs Martin Chinn and Doreen K. Chiu. Defendant Qi then refused to deposit monies into escrow and move forward with the sale.

Plaintiffs filed a complaint asserting various causes of action, including Breach of Contract, Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing, Common Count, and Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations. Defendant Qi filed a cross-complaint asserting causes of action for Negligence, Equitable Indemnity, Comparative Fault, Apportionment and Contribution, and Declaratory Relief.

The Judge found that the arbitration agreement in the Purchase Agreement is valid and that the Defendant has met its burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement. The Judge also found that Plaintiffs have not met their burden of proving waiver. Finally, the Judge concluded that there is no possibility of conflicting rulings and granted the motion to compel arbitration and stay court action.
