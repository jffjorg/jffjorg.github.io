The Judge grants the motion of AIG Specialty Insurance Company (Proposed Intervenor) to intervene in the action between Custom Alloy Sales, Inc. and Endurance American Specialty Insurance Company against Thatcher Company of Nevada, Inc. The Proposed Intervenor seeks to intervene because its insured, Thatcher, is a forfeited company and the Proposed Intervenor may be required to satisfy any judgment entered against Thatcher. The Judge finds that the Proposed Intervenor has a direct and immediate interest in the litigation and that intervening will not enlarge the issues in the case. The motion is granted, allowing the Proposed Intervenor to file its proposed Answer-in-Intervention and to assert any defenses on behalf of Thatcher.
