RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant Newhere, Inc. dba CBDFX
NOTICE: ok
 
RELIEF REQUESTED: An order requiring
Defendant Newhere, Inc. dba CBDFX.com aka Newhere Products aka Newhere Brands
to pay reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred pursuant to CCP 2033.420.

 
RULING: The motion is granted as set forth
below.  
 
SUMMARY
OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This
action arose out of the alleged breach of a contract between Plaintiff
Vaping360 GMBH (Plaintiff) and Defendant Newhere, Inc. dba CBDFX.Com
(Defendant) for use of Plaintiff’s website hyperlinks to promote and sell
Defendant’s products.  Plaintiff
contended that the contract stipulated that Plaintiff would receive commission
based on the use of the hyperlinks from Plaintiff’s website to Defendant’s
website to purchase Defendant’s products. 
 
On
8/15/22, Plaintiff served Defendant with Requests for Admissions, Set 1.  (Ross Decl., Ex.A).  Defendant first served responses to the
Requests for Admissions, Set 1, on 10/3/22. 
(Ross Decl., Ex.B).  On 11/7/22,
Defendant served further responses to some of the Requests.  (Ross Decl., Ex.C).  On 12/5/22, Plaintiff filed a motion to
compel further responses to the remainder of the Requests.  (Ross Decl., Ex.D).  Before the hearing on the motion, Defendant
served unverified further responses which were not code-compliant.  (Ross Decl., Ex.E).  On 1/3/23, the Court granted Plaintiff’s
motion.  (Ross Decl., Ex.F).  After Plaintiff filed a motion for
terminating sanctions, Defendant served the further responses ordered by the
Court. (Ross Decl., Ex.G).   Defendant
failed to admit several of the Requests. 
 
On
7/5/23 and 7/6/23, a court trial of the action was held after which judgment
was entered for Plaintiff against Defendant on the complaint for the principal
and total amount of $821,040.59.  (See
7/5/23 and 7/6/23 Minute Orders).  The Judgment
and a Statement of Decision were signed and filed on 8/3/23.  On 8/14/23, Plaintiff filed and served Notice
of Entry of Judgment.  
 
On 10/13/23, Plaintiff filed and served the instant
motion seeking an order requiring Defendant Newhere, Inc. dba CBDFX.com aka
Newhere Products aka Newhere Brands to pay reasonable attorney’s fees and costs
incurred pursuant to CCP 2033.420.  The
motion is made on the grounds that Defendant unreasonably failed to admit the
truth of the following matters when requested to do so in Requests for
Admissions propounded on 8/15/22, which required Plaintiff to incur fees and
costs to prove such matters: 
(1) That Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a contract
in or about December 2017. (Plaintiff’s Request for Admission, Set One, No. 1)
 
(2) That under the Agreement Plaintiff would market and
review Defendant’s products on the website and provide hyperlinks for users to
purchase Defendant’s products. (Plaintiff’s Request for Admission, Set One, No.

(5) That pursuant to the Agreement Commissions were to be
paid monthly. (Plaintiff’s Request for Admission, Set One, No. 9)

meant that Plaintiff was to be paid Commissions on all re-purchases.
(Plaintiff’s Request for Admission, Set One, No. 11). 
 
(8) That Defendant was aware that infinite cookies were
part of the Agreement. (Plaintiff’s Request for Admission, Set One, No. 12) 
 
(9) That the Agreement did not terminate until
Plaintiff’s affiliate account was terminated. (Plaintiff’s Request for
Admission, Set One, No. 13) 
 
(10) That Ali Esmaili was on emails where the 50%
Commission was discussed. (Plaintiff’s Request for Admission, Set One, No. 18) 
 
(11) That Ali Esmaili was on emails where the 50%

(12) That Ali Esmaili was on emails where infinite
cookies were discussed. (Plaintiff’s Request for Admission, Set One, No. 20)

ANALYSIS
 
The purpose of Requests for Admissions is to narrow
discovery, eliminate disputed issues, shift the cost of proving certain matters
and expedite trial.  City of Glendale
(2015) 235 CA4th 344, 353-354; Bloxham (2014) 228 CA4th 729, 752.  Requests for Admissions are not limited to
matters within the personal knowledge of the responding party; therefore, that
party must make a reasonable investigation of the facts before answering
requests that do not fall within the party’s personal knowledge.  Wimberly (1997) 56 CA4th 618.  
 
CCP 2033.420 provides:   
 
“(a) If a party fails to admit the
genuineness of any document or the truth of any matter when requested to do so
under this chapter, and if the party requesting that admission thereafter
proves the genuineness of that document or the truth of that matter, the party
requesting the admission may move the court for an order requiring the party to
whom the request was directed to pay the reasonable
expenses incurred in making that proof, including reasonable attorney's fees.

(b) The court shall make this order
unless it finds any of the following:
(1) An objection to the request was
sustained or a response to it was waived under Section
2033.290.
(2) The admission sought was of no
substantial importance.
(3) The party failing to make the
admission had reasonable ground to believe that that party would prevail on the
matter.
(4) There was other good reason for
the failure to admit.”
 
The party seeking to benefit from an exception listed in
CCP 2033.420(b) has the burden to establish the exception.  See Spahn (2021) 72 CA5th 208,
216; Samsky (2019) 37 CA5th 517, 523. 
Defendant has failed to establish that any of the exceptions apply.
 
There is no evidence that an objection to any of the
subject Requests was sustained or a response to the Requests was waived under
CCP 2033.290.
 
In response to the subject Requests, Defendant denied
that there was any contract or agreement between the parties and denied that
the principal of Defendant, who signed the verifications, and other
employees/agents of Defendant were on numerous emails discussing and agreeing
to the terms of the agreement.  At trial,
Plaintiff proved that there was a written agreement between the parties for
Plaintiff to use hyperlinks to promote and sell Defendant’s products (Requests
Nos. 1 and 2), and that the terms of the agreement included the following
terms: 50% Commission to Plaintiff (Requests Nos. 7, 18, 19, 23, 24); infinite
cookie days (Requests Nos. 10, 11, 12, 20, 21, 25, 26, 30, 31); Commissions to
be paid monthly based upon sales information tracked through third party
affiliate platform Post Affiliate Pro (Requests Nos. 3, 9); and that the
agreement did not terminate until Plaintiff’s affiliate account was terminated
(Requests No. 13).  Plaintiff also proved
that Defendant breached the agreement by not paying Plaintiff Commissions owed
totaling $821,040.59 (Requests Nos. 32 and 33). 
(See Ross Decl. ¶13, Ex. H). 
Ultimately, Plaintiff obtained a judgment against Defendant in the
amount of $821,040.59.  Id. 
 
The subject Requests were directly related to Plaintiff’s
breach of contract claim.  As such, they
were of substantial importance.  See
Brooks (1986) 179 CA3d 500, 509; Doe (2019) 37 CA5th 675, 690.  At trial, the Court found that each of the
facts Plaintiff requested Defendant admit was true (i.e., a contract existed
that Defendant through its principal, employees and agents agreed to; the terms
of the contract; the terms of the contract were ratified when signing up with
the terms on Post Affiliate Pro).
 
Defendant did not have good reason to deny Requests Nos.
1-3, 7, 9-13, 18-26, and 30-33 as there is no evidence that Defendant had
reasonable grounds to believe that it would prevail on the matters which were
the subject these Requests.  See Laabs
(2008) 163 CA4th 1242, 1276; Brooks, supra at 511; Grace
(2015) 240 CA4th 523, 530.  Defendant’s
denials of these matters was unreasonable, especially considering that
Defendant’s principal, employees, and agents were on emails that discussed the
terms of the agreement (a fact that was itself denied), and the emails were in
Defendant’s custody, possession, and control at the time these denials were
made.  See Orange County Water
District (2018) 31 CA5th 96, 118.  If
Defendant had admitted these facts, it would have substantially reduced the
time and resources required to litigate these issues and, possibly, could have
even eliminated the need for a trial at all. 

 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff is
entitled to recover from Defendant the reasonable expenses incurred in proving
the subject Requests, including reasonable attorney's fees.  CCP 2033.420(a).  The Court finds that the hourly rates of
$450/hour and $375/hour for the attorneys and the hourly rate of $175/hour for
paralegals that worked on this matter to be reasonable.  (See Ellrod Decl.; Ross Decl.)  
 
Plaintiff’s attorneys contend that 291.70 hours were
expended by their firm since the subject Requests were propounded on 8/15/22.  (Ross Decl. ¶15).  The Court finds that the subject Requests
relate to the ultimate issues decided by the Court.  (See 8/3/24 Statement of
Decision).  As such, it does not appear
that Plaintiff is attempting to recover fees for issues that “were completely
outside the scope of the requests for admissions.”  See Garcia (1994) 28 CA4th 724,
736-737.  
 
However, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s recovery should
be limited to the fees incurred after Defendant’s initial responses to the
Requests on 10/3/22, which included some of the denials and began Plaintiff’s
quest to obtain further/final code-compliant responses which include denials of
the other subject Requests.  As noted in
the reply, Plaintiff’s counsel claimed to have expended 282 hours from 10/3/22
to the end of July 2023 which totals $108,837.50 in claimed fees.  From that amount, $5,805.00 was deducted for
fees already paid as sanctions leaving $103,032.50 remaining in claimed fees.  (See Ross Reply Decl.).  Plaintiff also seeks to recover for an
additional 32 hours related to the instant motion for an additional $12,000.00,
plus $60.00 filing fee. 
 
The Court finds that the amount of time claimed by
Plaintiff’s counsel to have been spent between 10/3/22 and the end of July 2023
as well as in relation to the instant motion to be excessive.  Since Plaintiff has not provided information
as to how much time was spent by each attorney (at different hourly rates) and
paralegals to come to the 282 total, the Court reduces the dollar amount by one
quarter based on its evaluation that 24 hours, rather than the 32 hours
claimed, was reasonably spent in relation to the instant motion.  
 
As such, Plaintiff is awarded a total of $86,274.38 in
fees, including fees incurred in relation to this motion, plus the $60.00
filing fee for this motion for a total award of $86,334.38.  
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is granted.
