 Case Number:  24STCV00249    Hearing Date:   October 7, 2024    Dept:  78 DEPT:   78 OSC DATE:  10/07/2024 CASE NAME/NUMBER:  24STCV00249 MARTA ELVIRA RODRIGUEZ CAPACHO vs NUEVO SAN MIGUEL RESTAURANT GROUP INC., et al. REQUEST FOR COURT JUDGMENT AGAINST [DEFAULTING PARTY]:  Nuevo San Miguel Restaurant Group Inc. TENTATIVE RULING:  GRANT: Principal damages: $44,886.12 Attorney’s fees: $1,736.58 Interest: $2,250.90 Costs: $619.31 TOTAL: $49,492.91   TENTATIVE  Plaintiff Marta Elvira Rodriguez Capacho (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Nuevo San Miguel Restaurant Group Inc. (“Defendant”) and Does 1 through 20 for damages arising from her employment with Defendant as a waitress. Plaintiff sets forth eight causes of action for (1) failure to pay wages, (2) failure to pay minimum wages, (3) failure to pay overtime compensation, (4) failure to pay meal and rest periods, (5) failure to pay itemized wage and hour statements, (6) waiting time penalties, (7) failure to permit inspection of personnel and payroll records, and (8) unfair competition.  Plaintiff seeks default judgment against Defendant, and she has properly dismissed all unnamed Doe defendants. (Req. for Dismissal, June 21, 2024.)  This matter was previously heard on July 18, 2024, wherein the Court would conditionally grant default judgment upon Plaintiff submitting a new CIV-100 which completed mandatory Item 8. On August 14, 2024, Plaintiff filed a new CIV-100 curing the defect.  Additionally, on September 3, 2024, Plaintiff filed supplemental briefing to support the interest calculation. The Court grants the application for court judgment as follows:  Principal Damages  Plaintiff seeks $44,886.12 in principal damages, as pled in the complaint, for the following: Unpaid minimum wage compensation ($8,196.00), unpaid overtime compensation ($4,180.96), payment of meal and rest period compensation ($23,187.76), damages pursuant to Labor Code §226 ($4,000.00), waiting time penalties pursuant to Labor Code §§201-203 ($4,571.40), and statutory penalties pursuant to Labor Code §1198.5 ($750.00).  Plaintiff sufficiently supports the $44,886.12 in principal damages requested, and it is therefore granted.  Interest  Plaintiff seeks prejudgment interest in the amount of $2,250.90 based on 10% per annum of the principal damages. The application for default judgment was initially heard on August 23, 2024, and Plaintiff’s only objection was to this Court’s interest calculation. Plaintiff was given leave to submit further briefing to demonstrate that she is entitled to prejudgment interest on the entirety of the principal amount. On September 3, 2024, Plaintiff provided supplemental briefing on the interest calculation.  The Court amends its prior tentative, and grants Plaintiff $2,250.90 sought in interest.  Attorney Fees  Plaintiff seeks $8,531.50 in attorney fees. However, Plaintiff’s request for attorney’s fees is greater than that listed in the Los Angeles Superior Court, Local Rule 3.214 fee schedule. “An application for a fee greater than listed in the foregoing schedule because of extraordinary services must include an itemized statement of the services rendered or to be rendered.”¿(Local Rule 3.214 (d).) Although Plaintiff’s counsel provides an itemized statement of services, Plaintiff’s counsel has not demonstrated that the work performed on this case was extraordinary within the meaning intended by Local Rule 3.214(d). Consequently, the Court finds that no extraordinary services were rendered to justify the total fee requested greater than the fee schedule.   Pursuant to Local Rules of Court 3.214, the following will apply: “$10,000.01 to $50,000, $690 plus 3% of the excess over $10,000.”   Plaintiff is granted $1,736.58 in attorney’s fees. The amount of $1,736.58 allowable is based on the following calculation: ($44,886.12 - $10,000) x 3% + $690 = $1,736.58.  Costs  Plaintiff seeks costs in the amount of $696.52 for $558.26 in clerk’s filing fees, $61.05 in process server’s fees, $17.21 in postage fees, and $60.00 in investigation fees via Transunion. The clerk’s filing fees and process server’s fees fees are allowable pursuant to CCP § 1033.5(a)(1) and (a)(4). However, investigation fees and postage are not (CCP § 1033.5(b)(2) and (b)(3)); the non-conforming costs of $77.21 will be stricken.  Plaintiff is granted $619.31 in costs.  Conclusion  Plaintiff has demonstrated that she is entitled to default judgment in the reduced amount of $47,564.15, consisting of $44,886.12 in damages, $2,250.90 in prejudgment interest, $1,736.58 in attorney’s fees, and $619.31 in costs.
