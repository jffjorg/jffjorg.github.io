And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's complaint is granted without leave to amend. The plaintiff, Isaiah McGrath, filed a complaint against the Los Angeles Unified School District and New Designs Charter School for damages arising from a slip and fall at his school. The defendant, New Designs Charter School, moved to strike the prayer for "other damage: incidental damages" and "loss of consortium damages" because they are not relevant to the slip and fall case. The plaintiff did not oppose the motion, and the judge has found that the defendant has fulfilled the procedural requirement of meeting and conferring with the plaintiff's counsel. The judge has also determined that the incidental damages and loss of consortium damages are not supported by the facts of the case and that the plaintiff has failed to meet his burden to show how the complaint can be amended to change the legal effect of the pleading. As a result, the judge has granted the defendant's motion to strike without leave to amend.
