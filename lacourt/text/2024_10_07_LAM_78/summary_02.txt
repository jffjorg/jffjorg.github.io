And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents (RPDs) in a quiet title action between 1525 Colorado, LLC (Plaintiff) and Maniben Corp. et al. (Defendants). The Plaintiff filed motions to compel further responses to RPDs, Set One, and the Defendants filed an omnibus opposition. The judge finds that the Plaintiff met the requirements of the meet and confer declaration and separately submitted a statement for each motion to compel further responses.

The judge is reviewing requests Nos. 19-25, which relate to documents related to the East Los Angeles Planning Commission, the Los Angeles City Council, prior California Superior Court actions, prior writs of mandate, and City of Los Angeles - Department of Building and Safety applications. The Defendants objected to these requests on the grounds of relevance, but the judge finds that the requests are not wholly irrelevant. The judge grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to RPDs, Set One, as to Nos. 19-25, and orders the Defendants to provide further responses within 20 days.

The judge also denies the Plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions, as the Plaintiff failed to provide a rate, support for the rate, or any calculation for the Court to determine whether the request for monetary sanctions is reasonable.
