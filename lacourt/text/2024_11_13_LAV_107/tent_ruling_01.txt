COURT’S [TENTATIVE]
  ORDER RE:       
Motion
  for Terminating Sanctions



[THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: 
 
Deny 
 
Defendant
Jovito
Gilberto Palacios Labastida (“Defendant”) moves for terminating
sanctions dismissing Plaintiff Nicolas Justin Somers’ (“Plaintiff”) complaint. 
 
I.               
BACKGROUND 
 
On
November 24, 2020, Plaintiff and Defendant were involved in a motor vehicle
accident. (Complaint p. 5.) On October 17, 2022, Plaintiff filed a complaint
against Defendant and Does 1 to 10 alleging causes of action for motor vehicle
and general negligence. (Complaint pp. 4-5.) 
 
On
October 14, 2024, Defendant filed a motion for terminating sanctions (the
“Motion”). Plaintiff filed no opposition. On November 6, 2024, Defendant filed
a notice of non-opposition.
 
II.             
LEGAL
STANDARD 
 
“If
[a] party . . . fails to obey an order compelling attendance, testimony, and
production, the court may make those orders that are just, including the
imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating
sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against that party
deponent[.]” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450(h).) 
“The trial court may order a terminating sanction for discovery abuse
‘after considering the totality of the circumstances: [the] conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the
propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.’” (Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223
Cal.App.4th 377, 390.)¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
“The
discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions,
starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of
termination.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc.¿(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th
967, 992.) “Discovery sanctions ‘should be appropriate to the dereliction, and should not
exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to
but denied discovery.’” (Id.) “If a lesser sanction fails to curb
misuse, a greater sanction is warranted”. (Id.) 
 
“A decision to
order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation
is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less
severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the
trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes v.
Bentley Motors, Inc., supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) The
court should consider the totality of the circumstances, including “conduct of the
party to determine if the actions were willful; the detriment to the
propounding party; and the number of formal and informal attempts to obtain the
discovery.” (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246.) 
¿¿ 
For
example, the Third District held that terminating sanctions were warranted when
a party repeatedly failed to propound adequate discovery responses, even after
the court imposed monetary sanctions. (Liberty Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. LcL
Administrations, Inc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1096, 1099, 1106.) 
¿¿¿ 
Before
any sanctions may be imposed the court must make an express finding that there
has been a willful failure of the party to serve the required discovery
responses. (Fairfield v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County (1966)
246 Cal.App.2d 113, 118.) The party who failed to comply with discovery
obligations has the burden of showing that the failure was not willful. (Deyo
v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 788; Cornwall v. Santa Monica
Dairy Co. (1977) 66 Cal.App.3d 250, 252-253.)¿¿ 
 
III.           
DISCUSSION 
 
Defendant
seeks an order dismissing Plaintiff’s complaint with prejudice. (Memorandum at
p. 3.) Defendant states that he has “been trying to obtain Plaintiff’s
deposition since October 2023, yet Plaintiff has refused and failed to appear
at any of the five properly noticed depositions.” (Memorandum p. 1.) On
September 3, 2024, the court granted Defendant’s motion to compel Plaintiff’s
deposition within twenty days of the hearing. (Memorandum at p. 1; Matteis
Declaration ¶ 2.) On September 5, 2024, Defendant served Plaintiff with a
notice of deposition and notice to produce documents for inspection and
copying. (Memorandum at pp. 1-2; Matteis Declaration ¶ 3.) The noticed
deposition was scheduled for September 18, 2024, but Plaintiff failed to
respond. (Memorandum pp. 1-2.) On September 24, 2024, Defendant sent Plaintiff
a meet and confer letter inquiring about Plaintiff’s non-appearance at the
deposition. (Memorandum p. 2; Matteis Declaration ¶ 5.) Plaintiff did not
respond. (Memorandum p. 2; Matteis Declaration ¶ 6.)
 
Plaintiff
failed to appear at Defendant’s five noticed depositions, but this appears to
be the first time Plaintiff has failed to comply with this court’s discovery
order. And, although Defendant filed motions to compel Plaintiff’s responses to
Form Interrogatories, Specially Prepared Interrogatories, and Demand for
Identification and Inspection of Documents, Set One, Defendant later withdrew
those motions because Plaintiff provided responses. (Notice of Withdrawal filed
06/22/23.) 
 
Further,
[t]he discovery statutes evince an incremental approach to discovery sanctions,
starting with monetary sanctions and ending with the ultimate sanction of
termination.” (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc., supra, 174 Cal.App.4th at
p. 992.) Defendant did not request, nor did this court impose, sanctions
against Plaintiff for his failure to attend the deposition. (Motion to Compel
Plaintiff’s Deposition Memorandum of Points and Authorities; 09/03/24 Minute
Order.) Accordingly, there has been no “incremental approach to discovery
sanctions” here and the court declines to award the ultimate sanction of
termination.
 
IV.           
CONCLUSION
 
For
the foregoing reasons, this court denies the Motion.
