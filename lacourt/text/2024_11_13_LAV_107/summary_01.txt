And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English:

The Judge denies the Defendant's motion for terminating sanctions to dismiss the Plaintiff's complaint. The Defendant sought to dismiss the complaint due to the Plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery orders, specifically failing to appear at five noticed depositions. The Judge found that while the Plaintiff's conduct was willful and preceded by a history of abuse, the Judge declined to impose the ultimate sanction of termination due to the lack of an incremental approach to discovery sanctions. The Judge noted that the discovery statutes evince an incremental approach, starting with monetary sanctions and ending with termination, and that the Plaintiff did not fail to comply with discovery orders prior to the Defendant's motion. The Judge concluded that terminating sanctions were not warranted in this case.
