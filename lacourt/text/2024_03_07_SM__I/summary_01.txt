And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling on a motion for a protective order filed by the defendant in a breach of warranty of habitability case. The defendant seeks to modify the deposition process due to alleged mental and physical limitations, including a doctor's note stating that she is unable to perform new and complicated tasks such as serving on jury duty, attending court, or taking a deposition. The plaintiff opposes the motion, arguing that the defendant's lack of recall during the deposition is not sufficient to warrant a protective order. The court considers various options, including limiting the length of the deposition, allowing the defendant to answer written questions, or proceeding with one-hour sessions. The court expresses concerns about the defendant's ability to testify due to her medical condition and notes that the doctor's note is inadmissible hearsay unless produced in declaration form. The court grants the motion if the defendant provides a declaration under penalty of perjury, and orders the deposition to proceed in one-hour blocks starting 10 court days from today. If the plaintiff agrees to the defendant's offer not to call the defendant as a witness, the court will grant the motion and terminate the deposition forthwith.
