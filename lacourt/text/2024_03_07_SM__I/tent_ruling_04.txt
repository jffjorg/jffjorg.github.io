 Case Number:  23SMCV01051    Hearing Date:   March 7, 2024    Dept:  I The matter is here for three discovery motions.  All are motions to compel.  All of these motions are unopposed.The discovery in question was served on September 15,
2023.  The responses were due on October
17,2023, but no responses were served. 
There does not appear to have been any effort to meet and confer, but
there is no requirement to do so when no responses at all are received.  That said, defendant did write two letters to
plaintiff’s counsel requesting responses to which there appears to have been no
reply.  Defendant seeks sanctions of $860
per motion, which is not an unreasonable amount.  However, it assumes an hour to review the
opposition and draft a reply for each motion, and as such the true request is
$660 per motion.  The motions are GRANTED
except for RFP numbers 12, 14, 17, 18, 19, and 20, which the court does not
believe is calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and the
motion is therefore DENIED as to those. 
The court is not thrilled with the RFA’s, but they are not improper
under the Code of Civil Procedure and therefore the court has no discretion to
deny the motion.Accordingly (other than the RFP’s as to which the
motion is denied), verified responses without objection other than privilege
will be served within 30 days.  Privilege
objections can include privacy.  Any
responsive documents will be served within 15 days thereafter. Sanctions payable within 30 days.
