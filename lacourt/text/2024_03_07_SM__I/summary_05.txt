And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on an unopposed fee motion, granting the motion in the amount of $145,696. The motion was previously continued for further briefing on the rates charged by the plaintiff's counsel and evidence that the invoices were actually billed and paid in the amounts stated. The plaintiff prevailed in a contract case with an attorney's fee provision, which entitles the prevailing party to recover fees. The court used a "lodestar" methodology to determine the base line fees, finding the hourly rate and number of hours spent to be reasonable. The court also reviewed the bills and found that they were paid, which is evidence that the fees are reasonable. The motion is granted in the amount requested.
