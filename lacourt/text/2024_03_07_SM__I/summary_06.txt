And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the City of Santa Monica's motion to strike the plaintiff's complaint, citing Government Code section 815.6. The plaintiff alleges that the City negligently maintained the roadway, signage, shoulders, and shrubbery, leading to the opening of a gate that struck her while she was jogging. The City argues that the complaint fails to allege a mandatory duty, as required by section 815.6. The judge agrees, stating that the City's obligation to maintain the streets is not mandatory, as it involves discretionary decisions. The judge also notes that the plaintiff has failed to cite a specific statute or regulation that requires the City to perform a specific action. The motion is granted with leave to amend, allowing the plaintiff to re-file the complaint with more specificity.
