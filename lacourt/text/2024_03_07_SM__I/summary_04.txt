And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on three unopposed discovery motions to compel. The motions were filed by the defendant, who served discovery on September 15, 2023, but did not receive responses from the plaintiff. The defendant wrote two letters to the plaintiff's counsel requesting responses, but did not receive a reply. The judge granted the motions, except for certain requests that do not appear to be calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The judge ordered the plaintiff to serve verified responses without objection (except for privilege) within 30 days, and to serve responsive documents within 15 days thereafter. The defendant is also entitled to sanctions of $660 per motion, payable within 30 days.
