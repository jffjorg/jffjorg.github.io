Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The plaintiff, Phyllis R. Ginolfi, filed a lawsuit against Right Choice In-Home Care, Inc. and GMA Management Group, Inc. dba Pacoima Adult Day Care for dependent adult/elder abuse and negligence. Later, the defendant Keolis Transit America, Inc. was named as Doe 1. Keolis filed a request for prior pleadings and discovery on June 2, 2023, but the plaintiff did not serve a response or produce responsive documents.

Keolis then filed a motion to compel the plaintiff to provide complete documents, without objections, responsive to their request. The motion also requests sanctions against the plaintiff and/or their attorney, Law Offices of Steven C. Gambardella, in the amount of $860.00. However, the judge found that the request for prior pleadings and discovery does not comply with the statutory requirements, specifically CCP 2031.030. Therefore, the judge denied the motion.
