And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the petitioning papers and is ruling on the petitions to approve the compromise of the claims of minor Plaintiffs Valerie Lopez and Jose Perez. The petitions were filed by Petitioner Mayra Mancillas. The judge has reviewed the proposed settlements and has identified a discrepancy in the medical expense reimbursement for both Jose Perez and Valerie Lopez. After reviewing the petition and attachments, the judge has determined that the proposed settlements are reasonable and should be approved. The judge orders that the net balance of the settlements be deposited in insured accounts in Preferred Bank, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the Court. The judge sets an order to show cause re: distribution of settlement proceeds on May 14, 2024, and an order to show cause re: dismissal (settlement) on the same date. The judge orders Petitioner to give notice of the ruling and to file proof of service of the ruling with the Court within five days.
