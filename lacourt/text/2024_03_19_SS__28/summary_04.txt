The judge also grants Activ's motion to compel responses to requests for admission from Alston. The judge denies Activ's requests for monetary sanctions, finding that Alston did not make or oppose motions to compel responses, and that Activ did not identify a statutory basis for sanctions. The judge orders Alston to serve verified code-compliant responses to the discovery requests without objections by April 18, 2024.
