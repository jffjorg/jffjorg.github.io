 Case Number:  22STCV32763    Hearing Date:   March 19, 2024    Dept:  28 Having  considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows.  BACKGROUND  On  October 6, 2022, Plaintiffs Alma Perez (“Perez”) and Eduardo De Leon Chavez (“Chavez”)  filed this action against Defendants Alexandra Mora Segura (“Segura”), Anthony  Luis Duchesne (“Duchesne”), and Does 1-25 for motor vehicle tort and general  negligence.  On  June 9, 2023, Segura and Duchesne (“Defendants”) filed an answer and a  cross-complaint against Cross-Defendants Chavez and Roes 1-5 for contribution,  indemnity, and declaratory relief.  On  September 7, 2023, the clerk entered Chavez’s default on the cross-complaint.  On  February 16, 2024, Defendants filed a motion for terminating sanctions, to be  heard on March 19, 2024.  Plaintiffs have  not filed an opposition.  The  trial is currently set for August 2, 2024.  DEFENDANTS’ REQUESTS  Defendants  ask the Court to issue terminating sanctions against Plaintiffs and dismiss the  case.  In the alternative, Defendants request  monetary sanctions.  LEGAL STANDARD  Code  of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 provides in part:  “To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any  particular discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court,  after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity  for hearing, may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in  conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process:  “(a) The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering  that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney  advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including  attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. The court may  also impose this sanction on one unsuccessfully asserting that another has  engaged in the misuse of the discovery process, or on any attorney who advised  that assertion, or on both. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision  of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the  one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other  circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.  “(b) The court may impose an issue sanction ordering  that designated facts shall be taken as established in the action in accordance  with the claim of the party adversely affected by the misuse of the discovery  process. The court may also impose an issue sanction by an order prohibiting  any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process from supporting or  opposing designated claims or defenses.  “(c) The court may impose an evidence sanction by an  order prohibiting any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process  from introducing designated matters in evidence.  “(d) The court may impose a terminating sanction by  one of the following orders:  “(1) An order striking out the pleadings or parts of  the pleadings of any party engaging in the misuse of the discovery process.  “(2) An order staying further proceedings by that  party until an order for discovery is obeyed.  “(3) An order dismissing the action, or any part of  the action, of that party.  “(4) An order rendering a judgment by default against  that party.  “(e) The court may impose a contempt sanction by an  order treating the misuse of the discovery process as a contempt of court.  “(f) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), or any other  section of this title, absent exceptional circumstances, the court shall not  impose sanctions on a party or any attorney of a party for failure to provide  electronically stored information that has been lost, damaged, altered, or  overwritten as the result of the routine, good faith operation of an electronic  information system.  “(2) This subdivision shall not be construed to alter  any obligation to preserve discoverable information.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.)            Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300 provides in part:  “If a party then fails to obey an order compelling  further response to interrogatories, the court may make those orders that are  just, including the imposition of an issue sanction, an evidence sanction, or a  terminating sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010). In  lieu of, or in addition to, that sanction, the court may impose a monetary  sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010).  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.300,  subd. (e).)  A  violation of a discovery order supports the imposition of terminating  sanctions. (Collison & Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th  1611, 1620.) Terminating sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in  disobeying the court's orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d  771, 795-796 (Deyo).)  A  terminating sanction is a "drastic measure which should be employed with  caution." (Deyo, supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "A  decision to order terminating sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a  violation is willful, preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows  that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery  rules, the trial court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky  v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.)    DISCUSSION  On  December 12, 2023, the Court (1) granted Segura’s motion to compel further responses to special  interrogatories, set one, served on Perez and ordered Perez to provide  verified, code-compliant further responses to special interrogatories 1-8 by  February 13, 2024, (2) granted Segura’s motion to compel further responses to  special interrogatories, set one, served on Chavez and ordered Chavez to  provide verified, code-compliant further responses to special interrogatories  1-8 by February 13, 2024, (3) granted Segura’s motion to compel further  responses to form interrogatories, set one, served on Perez and ordered Perez  to provide verified, code-compliant further responses to the form  interrogatories by February 13, 2024, (4) granted Segura’s motion to compel  further responses to form interrogatories, set one, served on Chavez and ordered  Chavez to provide verified, code-compliant further responses to the form  interrogatories by February 13, 2024, (5) granted Segura’s requests for  sanctions and ordered Perez and her counsel to pay Segura $924.14 by February 13, 2024, and (6) granted Segura’s requests for sanctions  and ordered Chavez and his counsel to pay Segura $924.14 by February 13, 2024.  Plaintiffs  did not comply with the Court’s December 12, 2023 order.  Defendants now ask the Court to impose  terminating sanctions on Plaintiffs and dismiss their case.    Despite the authorities holding that  terminating sanctions are not available unless the plaintiff’s violation is  preceded a history of abuse, Defendants argue the Court may impose terminating  sanctions based on a plaintiff’s violation of a single discovery order.  To support  this argument, Defendants cite Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th  1225 (Lang), but in that case “the trial court imposed terminating  sanctions and entered a $22 million default judgment after defendants failed to  comply with three discovery orders.”  (Lang, supra, 77 Cal.App.4th at  p. 1228, original emphasis; see also id. at pp. 1246-1247 [explaining  basis for terminating sanctions, including responding party’s inaccurate assertions  that it had fully complied with discovery requests].)  The  Court finds that Plaintiffs’ failure to comply with the Court’s December 12,  2023 order is sanctionable but does not, without more, warrant terminating  sanctions. The Court grants Defendants’ alternative request for monetary  sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.300, subdivision (e), and  awards Defendants $380.34 based on two hours of attorney time at a rate of  $160.17 per hour and one $60.00 filing fee.  CONCLUSION  The  Court DENIES without prejudice the motion for terminating sanctions filed by Defendants Alexandra Mora Segura and Anthony Luis Duchesne.  The  Court GRANTS the request for monetary sanctions of Defendants Alexandra Mora  Segura and Anthony Luis Duchesne and orders Plaintiffs Alma Perez and Eduardo De Leon Chavez to pay Defendants Alexandra Mora  Segura and Anthony Luis Duchesne $380.34 by April 18, 2024.  Moving  parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Moving  parties are ordered to file a proof of service of this ruling with the Court  within five days.
