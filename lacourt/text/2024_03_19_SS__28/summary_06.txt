And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The case is about motor vehicle tort and general negligence. The defendants filed a motion for terminating sanctions, which is to be heard on March 19, 2024. The plaintiffs have not filed an opposition. The trial is currently set for August 2, 2024.

The court granted the defendants' motion to compel further responses to special interrogatories and form interrogatories, and ordered the plaintiffs to provide verified, code-compliant further responses. The court also granted the defendants' requests for sanctions and ordered the plaintiffs to pay the defendants $924.14. However, the plaintiffs did not comply with the court's order.

The defendants argue that the court may impose terminating sanctions based on a single discovery order. The court finds that the plaintiffs' failure to comply with the discovery order is sanctionable, but does not warrant terminating sanctions. The court grants the defendants' alternative request for monetary sanctions and awards them $380.34. The court denies the motion for terminating sanctions without prejudice.

The court orders the plaintiffs to pay the defendants $380.34 by April 18, 2024. The moving parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling and file a proof of service with the court within five days.
