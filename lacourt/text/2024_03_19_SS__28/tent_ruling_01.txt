this action against Defendants Alvino Martinez, Natalie Martinez, A&N
Trucking, Alpha Movers LLC, Apple Van Lines, and Does 1-50 for negligence,

On

On March 14, 2022, Defendants Natalie Martinez and Alvino Martinez,
individually and dba A&N Trucking, filed an amended answer. 
On

Plaintiffs’ request. On June 23, 2022,
the Court dismissed Alpha Movers LLC without prejudice at Plaintiffs’ request. 
On
February 13, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement. 
On February
16, 2024, Petitioner Mayra Mancillas (“Petitioner”) filed petitions to approve
the compromise of the cases of minor Plaintiffs Valerie Lopez and Jose Perez to
be heard on March 19, 2024. 
PETITIONER’S REQUESTS 
Petitioner
Mayra Mancillas asks the Court to approve the compromise of the claims of minors Valerie Lopez and Jose Perez. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
“‘[W]ithout
trial court approval of the proposed compromise of the ward’s claim, the
settlement cannot be valid. [Citation.] [¶] Nor is the settlement binding [on
the minor] until it is endorsed by the trial court.’” (Pearson v. Superior
Court (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1338; see Prob. Code, §§ 3500, 3600, et
seq.; Code Civ. Proc., § 372.) 
To
obtain court approval of the settlement of a minor’s claims, the petitioner
must file a complete and “verified petition for approval of the settlement and
must disclose ‘all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness of
the compromise.’ [Citations.]” (Barnes v. Western Heritage Ins. Co.
(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 249, 256; see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.950.) 
DISCUSSION      
A.   Jose Perez, age 10
Proposed
settlement information:Gross
settlement: $4,000.00Attorney’s
fees: $1,000.00Net
settlement: $2,445.79Distribution
of net settlement: Deposited in insured accounts in one or more financial
institutions in the state, subject to withdrawal upon court authorization
 Section
12a of the petition states that total medical expenses are $3,790.02 and
negotiated, statutory, and contractual reductions come to $419.21. Based on
these figures, $3,370.81 in medical expenses should be reimbursed from the
settlement proceeds. However, section 12a(4) states that only $419.21 will be
reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  This leaves $2,951.60 in medical expenses apparently unaccounted for. 
The
discrepancy appears to exist because Section 12a(3) of the petition does not
reflect all of the negotiated, contractual, and statutory reductions of the
medical expenses. Section 12b(4) of the petition shows that Medi-Cal paid
$2,885.02 of the medical expenses but is asking for reimbursement of only
$19.21. The difference between these two figures -- $2,865.81 -- is a reduction
in the amount of medical expenses. Section 12b(5) reflects a separate
reduction. According to the petition, medical service providers with $905 in
liens have agreed to accept $400, resulting in a reduction of $505. Adding
these two reduction amounts ($2,865.81 and $505) together results in $3,370.81
in reductions (rather than $419.21 as the petition currently states). With this
figure for reductions, the reimbursement figure of $419.21 is appropriate
because the reductions plus the reimbursement from the settlement proceeds
ensure that the settlement reimburses all medical expenses that have not been
reduced or waived. 
With
this understanding, the Court approves the proposed settlement. 
B.   Valerie Lopez, age 16Proposed
settlement information:Gross
settlement: $7,500.00Attorney’s
fees: $1,875.00Net
settlement: $4,184.42Distribution
of net settlement: Deposited in insured accounts in one or more financial
institutions in the state, subject to withdrawal upon court authorization
  Section
12a of the petition states that total medical expenses are $6,934.50 and
negotiated, statutory, and contractual reductions come to $1,170.22. Based on
these figures, $5,764.28 in medical expenses should be reimbursed from the
settlement proceeds. However, section 12a(4) states that only $1,170.22 will be
reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  This leaves $4,594.06 in medical expenses apparently unaccounted for.  
The
discrepancy appears to exist because Section 12a(3) of the petition does not
reflect all of the negotiated, contractual, and statutory reductions of the
medical expenses. Section 12b(4) of the petition shows that Medi-Cal paid
$4,804.50 of the medical expenses but is asking for reimbursement of only
$370.22. The difference between these two figures -- $4,434.28 -- is a
reduction in the amount of medical expenses. Section 12b(5) reflects a separate
reduction. According to the petition, medical service providers with $2,130 in
liens have agreed to accept $800, resulting in a reduction of $1,330. Adding
these two reduction amounts ($4,434.28 and $1,330) together results in
$5,764.28 in reductions (rather than $1,170.22 as the petition currently
states). With this figure for reductions, the reimbursement figure of $1,170.22
is appropriate because the reductions plus the reimbursement from the
settlement proceeds ensure that the settlement reimburses all medical expenses
that have not been reduced or waived. 
In
addition, in Attachment 11b(3), the Court will assume the name “Heather Blakely”
is meant to refer to Petitioner Mayra
Mancillas. 
With
these understandings, the Court approves the proposed settlement.

Court GRANTS the petition to approve the compromise of Plaintiff Valerie Lopez’s

in insured accounts in Preferred Bank, 1801 Century Park East, Suite 100, Los
