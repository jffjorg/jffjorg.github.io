And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendant Laila Aaen to the cross-complaint filed by Cross-Complainants Brandon Lamahr Frison and All American Towing Inland Empire, LLC. The cross-complaint alleges that the negligence of Aaen and other Cross-Defendants caused the damages alleged in Plaintiff Kimberley Marie Elerton's complaint. However, the cross-complaint fails to allege any facts supporting this claim. Therefore, the judge sustains the demurrer with leave to amend. The judge orders the moving party to give notice of this ruling and to file proof of service of this ruling with the court within five days.
