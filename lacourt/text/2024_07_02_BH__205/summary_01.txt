Summary:
This is a tentative ruling by Judge Edward B. Moreton Jr. on a motion to set aside default and default judgment filed by Defendant Onesimo Martinez Jr. in a breach of contract case. The plaintiff, MAXIM COMMERCIAL CAPITAL, LLC, entered into an Equipment Finance Agreement with the defendant, STONERIDGE CONSTRUCTION, LLC, to finance the purchase of equipment. The defendant defaulted on payments, and the plaintiff accelerated the balance due. The defendant's father bears the same name and resides at the same address as the defendant, which is where the process server attempted to serve the defendant. The process server claimed to have served the defendant at this address, and a skip trace report showed that the phone number on the call box belonged to the defendant. The judge credits the process server's declaration and concludes that the defendant was properly served. Therefore, the judge denies the motion to set aside default and default judgment.
