The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on two motions filed in this case. The Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents is granted in part, requiring the defendant to produce certain documents, including those in their custody. However, the objection to one item is sustained, and some documents are limited in scope. The Motion to Compel Further Responses to Request for Admissions is also granted in part, with some objections sustained. As a result, the plaintiff is granted sanctions against the defendant and their attorneys in the amount of $710.00. All further responses are due within 30 days of notice of this ruling.
