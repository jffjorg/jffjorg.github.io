And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting the motions of Defendants Adam Johnston and Maria Cervantes to compel Plaintiff Jose Tamayo to provide responses to Form Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents. The Plaintiff failed to respond to the discovery requests served on March 24, 2023, and the deadline for response was April 25, 2023. The Court finds that the Defendants are entitled to a court order directing the Plaintiff to provide responses without objections to the discovery requests. The Court also denies the Defendants' request for sanctions, as the motions were not opposed. The Court notes that the request for sanctions under CCP sections 2023.010 for the misuse of discovery is also denied, as these sections do not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.
