And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the legal file and determined that the case was erroneously filed as a Personal Injury (PI) matter. As a result, the court is referring the case to Department 1 for review and determination as to whether the case should be reassigned to an Independent Calendar (IC) court. The court is also vacating the hearing on demurrer scheduled for December 6, 2023, and directing the judicial assistant to give notice to the plaintiff, who must then give notice to all parties of record. If Department 1 determines that the case is not a PI matter, all hearings currently set in Department 30 of the Spring Street Courthouse will be taken off calendar, subject to being reset and notified by the receiving court.
