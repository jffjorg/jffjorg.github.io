And here is the summary in English text:

The Court has reviewed the Petitioner's Expedited Petitions to Approve Minor's Compromise and has found the settlement to be reasonable. However, the petition still contains a defect, which is that it does not state the reasons for the apportionment of the settlement payments between the claimants and the Petitioner. The Court notes that all other required documents, including updated medical billing statements and a declaration of written assurance, have been filed. Therefore, the hearing on the petitions is continued for 60 days, at which time the Petitioner must file a supplemental declaration explaining the apportionment.
