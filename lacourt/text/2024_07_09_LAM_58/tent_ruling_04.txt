Matter:                        Motion to Quash
Service of Summons
Moving Parties:          Defendants
Mathew Ludlow and Richard Abrams
Responding
Party:      Plaintiff GFD Wilcox LLC
 
Tentative
Ruling:      Defendants’
motion to quash service of summons is denied.
 
            This
is an unlawful detainer action. On March 12, 2024, Plaintiff GFD Wilcox LLC
(Plaintiff) filed this action against Defendants Mathew Ludlow and Richard
Abrams (Defendants) based on alleged non-payment of rent. The Complaint alleges
that when the action was filed, Defendants were in arrears over $37,000.  
            On June 12, 2024, Defendants
filed this motion to quash service of summons. On June 25, 2024, Plaintiff
filed an opposition. No reply was filed.
 
            The motion to quash is denied.
 
Factual and legal background 
 
“A defendant . . . may serve and file a notice of motion
for one or more of the following purposes:  (1) To quash service of summons on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction of the court over him or her. . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 418.10(a).)  
 
On April 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed proofs of service – one
as to each Defendant – that the summons was posted at the subject property on
April 9, 2024.  On April 25, 2024,
Plaintiff filed two more proofs of service – one for each Defendant – attesting
to service by mail on April 9, 2024 under Code of Civil Procedure section
415.45.
“In the absence of a voluntary submission to the
authority of the court, compliance with the statutes governing service of
process is essential to establish that court’s personal jurisdiction over a
defendant. When a defendant challenges that jurisdiction by bringing a motion
to quash, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction
by proving, inter alia, the facts requisite to an effective service.” (Dill
v. Berquist Construction Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1439–1440; accord Lebel
v. Mai (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1160 [“It was incumbent upon plaintiff,
after the filing of defendant’s motion to quash, to present evidence
discharging her burden to establish the requisites of valid service on
defendant”].) “[T]he filing of a proof of service creates a rebuttable
presumption that the service was proper,” but only if it “complies with the
statutory requirements regarding such proofs.” (Id. at pp. 1441-1442.) 
Discussion
Defendants Ludlow and Abrams now move the court to
quash service of the summons and complaint on the ground they were not served
with process. Both Defendants claims no personal service was made and that the
summons was not posted at the leased property. 
Ludlow does admit that he received the summons and complaint by mail;
Abrams denies receiving service by mail.
On April 2, 2024, the court granted Plaintiff’s application
for an order pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 415.45 allowing
service of the summons and complaint by posting at the premises which are the
subject of this unlawful detainer action and mailing them by certified
mail.  (Code Civ. Proc., §¿415.45(a).)  Section 415.45 states:
 
(a) A summons in an action for unlawful detainer of real
property may be served by posting if upon affidavit it appears to the
satisfaction of the court in which the action is pending that the party to be
served cannot with reasonable diligence be served in any manner specified in
this article other than publication and that: 
 
(1) A cause of action exists against the party upon whom
service is to be made or he is a necessary or proper party to the action; or 
 
(2) The party to be served has or claims an interest in
real property in this state that is subject to the jurisdiction of the court or
the relief demanded in the action consists wholly or in part in excluding such
party from any interest in such property. 
 
(b) The court shall order the summons to be posted on the
premises in a manner most likely to give actual notice to the party to be
served and direct that a copy of the summons and of the complaint be forthwith
mailed by certified mail to such party at his last known address. 
 
(c) Service of summons in this manner is deemed complete
on the 10th day after posting and mailing. 
 
Evidence Code § 647 states that
the “return of a process server registered pursuant to Chapter 16 (commencing
with Section 22350) of Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code upon
process or notice establishes a presumption, affecting the burden of producing
evidence, of the facts stated in the return.”   
 
Where service is carried out by
a registered process server, Evidence Code section 647 applies to eliminate the
necessity of calling the process server as a witness as trial.  (Palm
Property Investments, LLC v. Yadegar (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 1419,
1427.)  The proof of service in this circumstance establishes a
presumption, affecting the burden of producing evidence of the facts stated in
the return.  (Id. at 1428.)  “The effect of a presumption
affecting the burden of producing evidence is to require the trier of fact to
assume the existence of the presumed fact unless and until evidence is
introduced which would support a finding of its nonexistence. . .”  (Id.) 

 
Here, on April 12, 2024, Plaintiff
filed proof of service by posting as to each Defendant on April 9, 2024, which
shows that service was carried out upon Defendants by a registered process
server. On April 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed two more proofs of service as to
each Defendant by certified mail. These were also executed by a registered
process server.  Defendants’ declarations
erroneously claim that Plaintiff filed no proofs of service of process. In
opposition to the motion, Plaintiffs submit exhibits of the postal service
certified mail receipts for both Ludlow and Abrams with the address of the
subject property showing delivery on April 12, 2024. The presumption of proper
service applies. Defendants provide no evidence, other than their own
declarations, to show that they were not served with the summons and complaint.
A trial court is not required to accept “self-serving evidence
contradicting [a] process server’s declaration.”  (American Express
Centurion Bank v. Zara (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 383, 390.) The party seeking to defeat service of process must present
sufficient evidence to show that the service did not take place as
stated.  (See Palm Property Investments, supra, 194
Cal.App.4th at p. 1428.)  Merely denying service took place without more
is insufficient to overcome the presumption.  (Ibid. [defendants
“were required to come forth with evidence beyond their answer [denying
service] to overcome the presumption” of Evidence Code section 647].)  Defendants’ declarations fail to rebut the presumption
that service of process was effected. 
 
Conclusion
The motion to quash service of the summons is
denied.
