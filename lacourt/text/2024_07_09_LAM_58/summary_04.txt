And here is the English-text summary:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the defendants' motion to quash service of the summons. The defendants, Mathew Ludlow and Richard Abrams, argue that they were not served with the summons and complaint, but the court finds that the plaintiff, GFD Wilcox LLC, has provided sufficient evidence of service by posting and certified mail. The court notes that the defendants' declarations are self-serving and do not rebut the presumption of proper service established by the proof of service. The court relies on California Code of Civil Procedure section 415.45 and Evidence Code section 647 to establish the presumption of proper service. The defendants are required to provide sufficient evidence to show that the service did not take place as stated, but they have failed to do so.
