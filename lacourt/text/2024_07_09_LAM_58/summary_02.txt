And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the City's motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication on all issues. The City failed to establish that Plaintiff was not able to perform her essential job duties without reasonable accommodations. The City also failed to establish a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for separating Plaintiff from her employment. The Judge found that the City engaged in a pattern of conduct consistent with retaliatory intent and that a causal link exists between Plaintiff's protected activity and the alleged adverse employment action. The Judge also found that the City failed to engage in a good faith interactive process and that the City's refusal to accommodate Plaintiff was an adverse employment action.

The Judge's ruling is based on the evidence presented, including Plaintiff's deposition transcripts, declarations, and exhibits. The Judge found that the City's reliance on English's declaration was insufficient to establish that Plaintiff could not be reasonably accommodated. The Judge also found that the City's offer of demotions to lower-paid positions was not a meaningful attempt to accommodate Plaintiff and did not constitute an interactive process.
