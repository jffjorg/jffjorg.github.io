court notes that, although the declaration filed in support of the reply was
filed on November 1, 2024, the reply brief was not filed with the court until
November 5, 2024.  However, because the
moving plaintiffs served their reply brief on the parties on November 1, 2024,
i.e., five court days before the hearing on this motion, the court has
considered the reply.  (Nov. 1, 2024
