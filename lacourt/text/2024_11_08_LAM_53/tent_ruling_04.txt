  Order RE:
 
plaintiff’s motion for monetary sanctions
  against defendant
 



 
MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Justin Pagano            
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       Defendant FCA US LLC
Motion for Monetary Sanctions Against Defendant
The court considered the moving papers filed in connection with this
motion.  
The court did not consider the opposition papers filed on November 5,
2024 because they were not served and filed at least nine court days before the
hearing on this motion.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1005, subd. (b).) 
DISCUSSION
Plaintiff Justin Pagano (“Plaintiff”) moves the court for an order
imposing monetary sanctions in his favor and against defendant FCA US LLC
(“Defendant”) in the amount of $10,000 “as reimbursement for [Plaintiff’s
counsel’s] costs and expenses in connection with [Defendant] and [Defendant’s
counsel’s] unprofessional behavior.” 
(Mot., p. 5:10-12.) 
The court denies Plaintiff’s motion because (1) this motion is, in
effect, requesting that the court decide the same matter that the court
previously ruled on in issuing its September 26, 2024 order denying Plaintiff’s
motion for sanctions on the ground that Defendant and its counsel were engaging
in unprofessional behavior, but Plaintiff did not satisfy the requirements of
Code of Civil Procedure section 1008,[1]
and (2) even if Plaintiff had satisfied the requirements of section 1008,
Plaintiff has not met his burden to show that the court should exercise its
discretion to impose sanctions against Defendant under Code of Civil Procedure
section 128.5 because, even if a failure to communicate with counsel constitutes
an action or tactic under that statute, Plaintiff has not presented adequate
argument and evidence establishing that such conduct was committed in bad
faith, was frivolous, or was solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.  (Pl. Aug. 12, 2024 Mot. for Sanctions, pp.
2:1-3:12 [describing conduct from April 2, 2024 to August 12, 2024]; Pl. Oct.
7, 2024 Mot. for Sanctions, pp. 2:1-3:13 [describing conduct from April 2, 2024
to August 12, 2024]; Powell v. County of Orange (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th
1573, 1577 [“The name of a motion is not controlling, and, regardless of the
name, a motion asking the trial court to decide the same matter previously
ruled on is a motion for reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure section
1008”]; Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1008, 128.5, subds. (a) [a court may order a party
to pay reasonable expenses incurred by another party as a result of actions or
tactics that are made in bad faith or frivolous], (b)(1) [stating that actions
or tactics include, but are not limited to, the making or opposing of motions
and filing of a complaint or other responsive pleading].)
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Justin
Pagano’s motion for sanctions. 
            The court orders plaintiff Justin
Pagano to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
DATED:  November 8, 2024
