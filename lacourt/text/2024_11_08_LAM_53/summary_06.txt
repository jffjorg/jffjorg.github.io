Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted a motion filed by the plaintiffs (LA Forward Institute, Sylvia Aroth, Kathleen L. Coates, and Gary Williams) to conduct limited discovery in preparation for a special motion to strike filed by the defendants (City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles City Council, Los Angeles Housing Department, and the Los Angeles Department of Transportation). The judge has allowed the plaintiffs to take the depositions of Meredith Abood and Juliet Oh to gather information about the defendants' actions and policies regarding the Venice Dell Community Project. The judge has ruled that the discovery is necessary to support the plaintiffs' prima facie case and to show that the defendants' conduct has violated the Fair Employment and Housing Act. The judge has also noted that the defendants have challenged the legal sufficiency of the Complaint, and that the plaintiffs must still present evidence to show that they have a likelihood of success on the merits.
