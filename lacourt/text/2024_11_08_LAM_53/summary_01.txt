And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents and for monetary sanctions. The defendant had requested that the court order the plaintiff to provide further responses to the defendant's requests for production of documents, without objections, and to award monetary sanctions in the amount of $2,500. The judge found that the defendant had not made a reasonable attempt to informally resolve each issue presented by the motion, as required by the California Code of Civil Procedure. The judge noted that the defendant had sent a letter to the plaintiff's counsel on May 9, 2024, but that the letter did not show a reasonable attempt to informally resolve each issue presented by the motion. The judge also found that the plaintiff had provided a meaningful response to the defendant's letter, but that the defendant had not engaged in a telephonic meet and confer conference with the plaintiff's counsel. Therefore, the judge denied the defendant's motion and ordered the plaintiff to give notice of this ruling.
