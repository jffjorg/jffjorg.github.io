RESPONDING PARTY:       Plaintiff Marquis Mejia Hill
(1)

Motion
to Strike Portions of Complaint
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff Marquis Mejia Hill
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action on January 10, 2022, against defendants
Memorial Hospital of Gardena[1] and Citiguard, Inc. 
Thereafter, on February 17,
2023, the court issued an order (1) granting the motion to compel arbitration
filed by defendant Citiguard, Inc. (“Defendant”), and (2) ordering Plaintiff
and Defendant to arbitrate the claims alleged in Plaintiff’s Complaint.  (Feb. 17, 2023 Order, p. 10:10-14.)  On March 3, 2024, the court entered an order
on the parties’ joint stipulation to vacate the February 17, 2023 order
compelling this action to arbitration. 
(Mar. 3, 2024 Stip. & Order, p. 3:13-16.)
Defendant filed the pending
demurrer and motion to strike on May 29, 2024, moving the court for an order
(1) sustaining its demurrer to each cause of action alleged in Plaintiff’s
Complaint, and (2) striking from Plaintiff’s Complaint the allegations
regarding alter ego liability and the requests for punitive damages and
supporting allegations.   
The court notes that the
demurrer and motion to strike were originally set for hearing on September 19,
2024.  Plaintiff, however, did not file opposition
papers to the demurer and motion to strike at least nine court days before the
original hearing as required, and instead filed opposition papers on September
13, 2024.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1005,
subd. (b).)  The court has considered the
opposition papers because (1) it appears that Plaintiff did not timely file his
opposition papers based on the understanding that the hearing was taken off
calendar, and (2) the court subsequently continued the hearing on these
matters, such that Defendant has now been afforded enough time to consider the
merits of the opposition.
After the demurrer and motion
to strike were filed, Plaintiff filed, on August 1, 2024, a Notice of Related
Case, identifying as related cases Taylor v. Memorial Hospital of Gardena (Case
No. 22STCV00532) (“Taylor”) and Chaira v. Citiguard Inc. (Case
No. 23STCV30401) (“Chaira”). 
(Aug. 1, 2024 Notice of Related Case, ¶¶ 1-2.)  On August 13, 2024, the court issued a minute
order finding that this case was related to Case No. 22STCV00532, and ordered
that this action was the lead case. 
(Aug. 13, 2024 Minute Order, p. 1.) 
The court further ordered that all hearings in cases other than the lead
case (i.e., this action) were taken off calendar.  (Ibid.)  However, this was a clerical error because the
court already found that this case was related to the Taylor case (Case
No. 22STCV00532) on May 10, 2022, and ordered that Taylor was the lead
case.  (May 10, 2022 Order in Case No.
22STCV00532, p. 1.)  
It appears that this clerical
error caused Plaintiff confusion in filing oppositions to the pending
matters.  Specifically, although
Defendant gave notice that the hearings in Taylor were taken off
calendar (which was a correct reading of the court’s incorrect August 13, 2024
minute order), Plaintiff expressed the belief that the hearings in this case
were supposed to be taken off calendar, presumably based on the court’s
earlier, May 9, 2022 order that Taylor was the lead case.  (Pl. Sep. 10, 2024 Objection, p. 2:1-14.) 
Thereafter, on September 18,
2024, the court issued a minute order finding, nunc pro tunc, that (1) this
case, Taylor, and Chaira were related cases, and (2) Taylor is
the lead case.  (Sep. 18, 2024 Minute
Order, p. 1.)  The court further ordered
that the hearing on the pending demurrer and motion to strike was continued to
November 8, 2024, of which Defendant gave Plaintiff notice.  (Sep. 18, 2024 Minute Order, p. 1; Sep. 18,
2024 Notice of Continued Hearing.)  Defendant therefore has been given an
opportunity to file substantive replies to Plaintiff’s oppositions,
notwithstanding that the opposition papers were not timely filed before the
original hearing on the pending demurrer and motion to strike. 
Thus, for the reasons set forth above, the court has considered the
moving and opposition papers filed in connection with the demurrer and motion
to strike.  No reply papers were filed. 
DEMURRER TO COMPLAINT
The court sustains Defendant’s
demurrer to the first cause of action for constructive discharge in violation
of public policy because it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action since Plaintiff has not alleged, in support of this cause of
action, facts establishing which public policy, as delineated in constitutional
or statutory provisions, motivated his termination.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e); Yau
v. Santa Margarita Ford (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 144, 154 [elements of claim
for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy]; Mendoza v. Western
Medical Center Santa Ana (2014) 222 Cal.App.4th 1334, 1338 [requirements of
public policies that may support a wrongful discharge claim].) 
The court overrules
Defendant’s demurrer to the second cause of action for intentional infliction
of emotional distress because it states facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action since (1) the court finds that, on the face of the Complaint, it is
not barred by the workers’ compensation exclusivity rule because Plaintiff has
alleged facts establishing that Defendant’s intentional conduct falls outside
of the scope of the risks encompassed within the compensation bargain as to
Plaintiff’s position as a security guard (Compl., ¶¶ 13, 15-18), and (2)
Plaintiff has alleged facts establishing that (i) Defendant’s conduct in (A) requiring
Plaintiff, a security guard without proper training and equipment, to, inter
alia, transfer bodies to freezers that were not cold enough to keep the
bodies frozen, such that they leaked bodily fluids, including on Plaintiff’s
person (Compl., ¶¶ 15-20), and (B) stating that if the security guards
(including Plaintiff) didn’t “get everything in line,” Defendant was “going to
put them on a 30-day notice or a 2-week notice” (Compl., ¶ 17) was so extreme
as to exceed all bounds of decency in a civilized community, such that
Plaintiff has alleged the element of extreme and outrageous conduct, and (ii) Plaintiff
suffered severe emotional distress (Compl., ¶¶ 37-38).  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e); Yau,
supra, 229 Cal.App.4th at p. 116 [“Physical and emotional injuries sustained
in the course of employment are preempted by the workers’ compensation scheme
and generally will not support an independent cause of action”]; Singh v.
Southland Stone, USA Inc. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 338, 366 [“the workers’
compensation exclusivity rule applies only if the risks resulting in the injury
were encompassed within the ‘compensation bargain’”]; Berry v. Frazier (2023)
90 Cal.App.5th 1258, 1273 [elements of intentional infliction of emotional
distress].)
The court overrules
Defendant’s demurrer to the third cause of action for retaliation because it
states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action since Plaintiff has
alleged facts establishing that (1) he complained to Defendant and Memorial
Hospital of Gardena about health and safety violations (Compl., ¶¶ 42, 17, 23),
such that Plaintiff has alleged facts showing that he disclosed information “to
a person with authority over” him that he believed is a violation of law, and
(2) Defendant retaliated against him for making such complaints by “saying he
could go home, meaning he would be terminated” (Compl., ¶ 42).  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e); Lab.
Code, § 1102.5, subd. (b).)  The court notes,
as Defendant raises in its moving papers, that Plaintiff has alleged that he
“is informed that ‘Junior’ informed the Health Department regarding the
problems” (Compl., ¶ 22).  This does not
allege that Plaintiff made a complaint for which Defendant retaliated against
Plaintiff.  However, as set forth above,
Plaintiff has also alleged that he made complaints about the possible health
and safety violations, which is sufficient to support this cause of
action.  (Compl., ¶¶ 42 [“Plaintiff
complained about the health and safety violation to Defendants”], 17 [Plaintiff
complained to the directors of Memorial Hospital of Gardena].)
The court overrules
Defendant’s demurrer to the fourth cause of action for failure to pay all wages
because it states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action since Plaintiff
(1) bases this cause of action on Labor Code 201 (Compl., p. 11:9-12 [citing
Lab. Code § 201]), which provides that wages earned and unpaid at the time of
discharge are due and payable immediately, and (2) has alleged that Defendant
has not provided to Plaintiff his last paycheck, such that Plaintiff has
alleged facts establishing that Defendant has failed to pay to Plaintiff all
wages due (Compl., ¶ 25).  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e); Lab. Code, § 201, subd. (a) [“If an employer
discharges an employee, the wages earned and unpaid at the time of discharge
are due and payable immediately”].)
The court overrules
Defendant’s demurrer to the fifth cause of action for failure to pay wages due
upon termination because it states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of
action since Plaintiff has alleged that, after being constructively discharged,
he was not provided with his last paycheck (Compl., ¶ 25) and therefore has
alleged that he is entitled to waiting time penalties under the Labor Code.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e); Lab.
Code, §§ 202, 203.)  Further, while
Defendant asserts that Plaintiff’s cause of action is uncertain because he does
not allege the date on which he terminated his employment, the court notes that
Plaintiff has alleged that he was employed by Defendant “from about January or
February 2021 to January 2022” (Compl., ¶ 12). 
MOTION TO STRIKE PORTIONS OF COMPLAINT
Defendant moves the court for an order striking the following from
Plaintiff’s Complaint: (1) allegations relating to the alter ego theory of
liability (Compl., ¶¶ 8-11), (2) the requests for punitive damages (Compl., ¶¶
32, 47), and (3) the prayer for punitive damages (Compl., Prayer, ¶ 4). 
First, the court denies Defendant’s motion to strike paragraphs 8-11
because Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged the elements of alter ego liability
and therefore these allegations are not improper or irrelevant.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (a); Cam-Carson,
LLC v. Carson Reclamation Authority (2022) 82 Cal.App.5th 535, 549-550 [conditions
of alter ego liability].) 
Second, the court denies as moot Defendant’s motion to strike the
request for punitive damages in paragraph 32 because that paragraph is alleged
in support of the first cause of action, to which the court has sustained
Defendant’s demurrer.  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 436, subd. (a).) 
Third, the court grants Defendant’s motion to strike the request for
punitive damages in paragraph 47 and the prayer for punitive damages because,
while Plaintiff has alleged facts establishing
malice and oppression (Compl., ¶¶ 15-20, 23-24), Plaintiff has not alleged
facts establishing advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization,
ratification, or an act of oppression, fraud, or malice on the part of an
officer, director, or managing agent of Defendant.  (Code Civ. Proc., §
436, subd. (a); Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (b).) 
The court notes that, in opposition, Plaintiff has argued that Lawrence
is a supervisor employed by Defendant and therefore may be considered to be an
officer, director, or managing agent of Defendant.  However, Plaintiff did not allege, in the
Complaint, that Lawrence is a supervisor with the authority to determine
corporate policy.  (Davis v. Kiewit
Pacific Co. (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 358, 366 [“‘Managing agents’ are
employees who ‘exercise[] substantial discretionary authority over decisions
that ultimately determine corporate policy’”].) 
ORDER
            The court sustains defendant Citiguard, Inc.’s demurrer to
plaintiff Marquis Mejia Hill’s first cause of action for constructive discharge
in violation of public policy. 
            The court overrules defendant Citiguard, Inc.’s demurrer to
plaintiff Marquis Mejia Hill’s second through fifth causes of action. 
            The
court grants defendant Citiguard, Inc.’s motion to strike the requests and
prayer for punitive damages set forth in paragraph 47 and paragraph 4 of the
prayer of plaintiff Marquis Mejia Hill’s Complaint. 
            The
court denies all other relief requested in defendant Citiguard, Inc.’s motion
to strike. 
            The court grants plaintiff Marquis Mejia Hill 20 days leave to
file a First Amended Complaint that cures the defects in the first cause of
action for constructive discharge in violation of public policy and the
requests for punitive damages set forth in this ruling.
 
            The court orders defendant Citiguard, Inc. to give
notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  November 8, 2024
