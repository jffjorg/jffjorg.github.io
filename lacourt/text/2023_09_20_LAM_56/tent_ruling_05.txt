  CASE NO.: 23STCV01162
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
PRO HAC VICE APPLICATION
 
Date: September 20, 2023
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Department: 56



 
MOVING PARTY: Specially
Appearing Defendants Edidin Partners, LLC; 1P Venture, LLC; KAN Funding, LLC;
Pescetarian Brothers, LLC; WM Investment Holdings, LLC; WMIH-I, LP; and Srilo,
LLC (collectively “Moving Defendants”)
 
Moving Defendants’
application for A. Mayer Kohn to be admitted pro hac vice (the “Application”)
complies with the requirements of California Rules of Court, rule 9.40.  The Court has considered the
Application.  No opposition papers were
filed.  Any opposition papers were
required to have been filed and served at least nine court days before the
hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005,
subdivision (b).  The Court therefore GRANTS
the Application.  (Sexton v. Superior
Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of
this ruling.
