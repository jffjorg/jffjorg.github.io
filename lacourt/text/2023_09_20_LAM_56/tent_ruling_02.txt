  CASE NO.: 21STCV22886
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: DISCOVERY MOTIONS
 
Date: 
  September 20, 2023
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56



 
MOVING PARTY: Defendant
Subaru of America, Inc. (“Moving Defendant”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY:
Plaintiff
 
The Court has reviewed
the moving and opposition papers.  The
Court exercises its discretion and has considered the opposition papers despite
Plaintiff’s failure to comply with the requirements of California Code of
Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
This action arises
out of the purchase of an allegedly defective vehicle (the “Vehicle”) that was
manufactured by Moving Defendant. 
Plaintiff’s complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges: (1) breach of the
Song-Beverly Act – breach of express warranty; (2) violation of Song Beverly
Act – breach of implied warranty; and (3) violation of Civil Code section
1793.2. 
On July 12, 2023,
Moving Defendant filed: (1) a motion to compel Plaintiff’s deposition (the
“Chavez Motion”); and (2) a motion to compel non-party Hector Arias’s
deposition (the “Arias Motion”).  On
August 1, 2023, Moving Defendant filed a motion to compel vehicle inspection
(the “Inspection Motion”).[1]
 
DISCUSSION
Under
CCP section 2025.450, if, after service of a deposition notice, a party to the
action or an officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, or a
person designated by an organization that is a party, without having served a
valid objection, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to
produce for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or
tangible thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice
may move for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony and
the production for inspection of any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing described in the deposition notice.  (CCP § 2025.450, subd. (a).)  The motion must both: (1) set forth specific
facts showing good cause justifying the production for inspection of any
document, electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice; and (2) include a meet and confer declaration pursuant to
CCP section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and
produce the documents, electronically stored information, or things described
in the deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has
contacted the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.  (CCP § 2025.450, subd. (b)(1)-(2); see
Leko v. Cornerstone Building Inspection Service (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th
1109, 1124 (the statute also applies when the deponent simply fails to
appear).)
Where
there has been no timely response to a demand for inspection, copying, testing
or sampling, the demanding party may seek an order compelling a
response.  (CCP § 2031.300, subd. (b).)  Failure to timely
respond waives all objections, including privilege and work
product.  (CCP § 2031.300, subd. (a).)  
 
Plaintiff’s
oppositions (collectively, the “Oppositions”) do not dispute the information
presented in the Motions regarding Moving Defendant’s attempts to depose
Plaintiff and Chavez and inspect the Vehicle. 
Plaintiff presents evidence that the failure to timely file the
Oppositions was due to a calendaring error. 
(See Chavez Opposition Declaration of Joshua Kohanoff (“Kohanoff
Decl.”) ¶¶ 14-16.)  Plaintiffs also
present evidence that they have offered dates for the depositions and for the
Vehicle inspection to proceed.  (See
Chavez Kohanoff Decl. ¶ 19, Inspection Kohanoff Decl. ¶ 13.)
 
            While
the Court acknowledges that Plaintiff’s counsel is now participating in the
discovery process, the Oppositions do not refute the Moving Defendant’s
evidence regarding the circumstances that necessitated the Motions.  The Court therefore GRANTS the Motions.  The depositions of Plaintiff and Chavez and
the inspection of the Vehicle are to occur within 30 days of the date of this
order.  
 
Monetary Sanctions
            The
Motions also request monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and counsel.  Moving Defendant seeks $2,796.50 in
connection with the Arias Motion, $3,571.50 in connection with the Chavez
Motion, and $1,810 in connection with the Inspection Motion.  
The Arias Motion sanctions
represent: (1) seven hours drafting the moving papers at a rate of $250 an
hour; (2) an anticipated one hour drafting reply papers and one hour appearing
at the hearing; and (3) $60 in filing fees. 
(Declaration of Alexander S. Rynerson (“Rynerson Decl.”) ¶ 17.)
 
The Chavez Motion sanctions
represent: (1) seven hours drafting the moving papers at a rate of $250 an
hour; (2) an anticipated one hour drafting reply papers and one hour appearing
at the hearing;(3) $1,261.50 in fees related to Plaintiff’s failure to timely
serve objections and appear at his deposition; and (4) $60 in filing fees.  (Chavez Motion Rynerson Decl. ¶ 26.)
 
The Inspection Motion sanctions
represent: (1) five hours drafting the moving papers at a rate of $250 per
hour; (2) an anticipated one hour drafting reply papers and one hour appearing
at the hearing; and (3) $60 in filing fees. 
(Inspection Motion Rynerson Decl. ¶ 19.)
             
The Court exercises its discretion
and awards Moving Defendant sanctions in the total reasonable amount of
$3,941.50, which represents 10 hours drafting the Motions collectively at a
rate of $250 per hour, $180 in filing fees, and $1,261.50 in deposition costs.  (Moran v. Oso Valley
Greenbelt Assn. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1029, 1034.)  Plaintiff and counsel are
ordered to pay this amount within 20 days of this order. 
 
             Moving party is ordered to give notice of this
ruling.
 
Parties who intend
to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org
as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at
www.lacourt.org.  If the department does
not receive an email and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion
will be placed off calendar.
