And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the demurrer filed by the defendant, Move Sales, Inc., and has determined that the cross-complaint (XC) filed by the plaintiffs, Patience and Fortitude, Inc. et al, fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The XC alleges breach of contract, account stated, and goods and services rendered against the defendants, including Kalie Caldwell and Harold Hildebrand. The Court finds that the XC does not sufficiently allege a basis for imposing alter-ego liability on Caldwell and Hildebrand, and that the claims against them are time-barred unless they relate back to the date that the plaintiffs initiated the action under an alter-ego theory. The Court sustains the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend.
