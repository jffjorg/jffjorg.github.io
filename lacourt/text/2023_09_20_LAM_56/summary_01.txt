The Court has considered the demurrer filed by the defendant, Move Sales, Inc., and has determined that the cross-complaint (XC) filed by the plaintiffs, Patience and Fortitude, Inc. et al, fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The XC alleges breach of contract, account stated, and goods and services rendered against the defendants, including Kalie Caldwell and Harold Hildebrand. The Court finds that the XC does not sufficiently allege a basis for imposing alter-ego liability on Caldwell and Hildebrand, and that the claims against them are time-barred unless they relate back to the date that the plaintiffs initiated the action under an alter-ego theory. The Court sustains the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend.

**English Summary:**

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by the defendants against a cross-complaint filed by the plaintiffs.  The judge finds that the cross-complaint, which alleges breaches of contract from 2017 and 2018, is likely time-barred unless the plaintiffs can successfully argue for an "alter ego" theory of liability against the two individuals named in the cross-complaint. The judge sustains the demurrer, allowing the plaintiffs 20 days to amend their cross-complaint and provide more evidence to support the alter ego claim.

  - Leek v. Cooper (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 399
intentions:
  - the court will sustain the Demurrer with 20 days leave to amend
significant\_statements:
  - the Demurrer was not timely filed with respect to Patience and Wander
  - the relation back doctrine tolls the statute of limitations on cross claims filed against a plaintiff, but it does not apply to cross-actions against codefendants or new parties
  - an alter ego theory of liability requires sufficient facts to show a unity of interest and ownership, and an unjust result if the corporation is treated as the sole actor
  - a claim based upon an alter ego theory is not itself a claim for substantive relief, it is a procedural device by which courts will disregard the corporate entity in order to hold the alter ego individual liable on the obligations of the corporation

This tentative ruling states that the court will sustain the Demurrer with 20 days leave to amend. The Demurrer was not timely filed with respect to Patience and Wander, and the relation back doctrine does not apply to cross-actions against codefendants or new parties. In order to recover on an alter ego theory, a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to show a unity of interest and ownership, and an unjust result if the corporation is treated as the sole actor. A claim based upon an alter ego theory is not itself a claim for substantive relief, it is a procedural device by which courts will disregard the corporate entity in order to hold the alter ego individual liable on the obligations of the corporation. The XC is based in alleged contractual breaches that occurred in 2017 and 2018 and the claims are therefore time-barred unless the claims against Caldwell and Hildebrand relate back to the date that Plaintiffs initiated the action under an alter ego theory. The XC alleges that Caldwell and Hildebrand are the cofounders of Patience and Wander, and that Patience and Wander were functionally the same entity. However, these allegations do not sufficiently allege a basis for alleging the personal liability of either Caldwell or Hildebrand.
