**English Summary:**

The judge is considering a demurrer filed by the defendants against a cross-complaint filed by the plaintiffs.  The judge finds that the cross-complaint, which alleges breaches of contract from 2017 and 2018, is likely time-barred unless the plaintiffs can successfully argue for an "alter ego" theory of liability against the two individuals named in the cross-complaint. The judge sustains the demurrer, allowing the plaintiffs 20 days to amend their cross-complaint and provide more evidence to support the alter ego claim.

intentions:
  - the court will sustain the Demurrer with 20 days leave to amend
significant\_statements:
  - the Demurrer was not timely filed with respect to Patience and Wander
  - the relation back doctrine tolls the statute of limitations on cross claims filed against a plaintiff, but it does not apply to cross-actions against codefendants or new parties
  - an alter ego theory of liability requires sufficient facts to show a unity of interest and ownership, and an unjust result if the corporation is treated as the sole actor
  - a claim based upon an alter ego theory is not itself a claim for substantive relief, it is a procedural device by which courts will disregard the corporate entity in order to hold the alter ego individual liable on the obligations of the corporation

This tentative ruling states that the court will sustain the Demurrer with 20 days leave to amend. The Demurrer was not timely filed with respect to Patience and Wander, and the relation back doctrine does not apply to cross-actions against codefendants or new parties. In order to recover on an alter ego theory, a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to show a unity of interest and ownership, and an unjust result if the corporation is treated as the sole actor. A claim based upon an alter ego theory is not itself a claim for substantive relief, it is a procedural device by which courts will disregard the corporate entity in order to hold the alter ego individual liable on the obligations of the corporation. The XC is based in alleged contractual breaches that occurred in 2017 and 2018 and the claims are therefore time-barred unless the claims against Caldwell and Hildebrand relate back to the date that Plaintiffs initiated the action under an alter ego theory. The XC alleges that Caldwell and Hildebrand are the cofounders of Patience and Wander, and that Patience and Wander were functionally the same entity. However, these allegations do not sufficiently allege a basis for alleging the personal liability of either Caldwell or Hildebrand.

## Case Summary: 

**Case Number:** 21STCV12788
**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023
**Department:** 56

**Plaintiffs:** Patience and Fortitude, Inc. ("Patience") and Wander and Ponder ("Wander")
**Defendants:** Move Sales, Inc. ("MSI") and others

**People Involved:** 
* Kalie Caldwell ("Caldwell")
* Harold Hildebrand ("Hildebrand")

**Facts:**
* This case stems from a business relationship that began in 2017 and 2018.
* Plaintiffs filed their initial lawsuit on April 2, 2021.
* Defendant MSI filed a cross-complaint (XC) on April 25, 2023, alleging breach of contract, account stated, and goods and services rendered. 
* Plaintiffs/cross-defendants (Patience, Wander, Caldwell, and Hildebrand) demurred to the XC, arguing it was untimely and lacked sufficient allegations for alter ego liability.

**Legal Issues:**
* **Timeliness:** The Court determined the cross-complaint was not timely filed, as it was filed after Patience and Wander filed their answers. 
* **Alter Ego Liability:** The Court found the XC did not sufficiently allege facts to support holding Caldwell and Hildebrand personally liable under an alter ego theory.

**Judge's Ruling:**
* The Court **sustains the demurrer** with 20 days leave to amend.

**Requirements for Amendment:**
* Plaintiffs must provide more specific facts to support potential alter ego liability against Caldwell and Hildebrand.

**Notes:**
* The judge emphasizes the need for factual support in alter ego claims, stating that conclusory allegations are insufficient.
* The judge highlights the importance of timely filing under California law. 


## English Summary: 

The judge ruled that the cross-complaint filed by Defendant MSI against the Plaintiffs (Patience and Wander) was not timely. The judge also ruled that the cross-complaint failed to adequately allege that the co-founders of Patience and Wander (Caldwell and Hildebrand) should be held personally liable for the company's actions. The judge granted the Plaintiffs 20 days to amend the cross-complaint and provide stronger evidence to support their claims.

# Case Summary

**Case Number:** 21STCV12788

**Hearing Date:** September 20, 2023

**Dept:** 56

**Parties:**

- Patience and Fortitude, Inc. (Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant)
- Wander and Ponder (Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant)
- Move Sales, Inc. (Defendant/Cross-Complainant)
- Kalie Caldwell (Cross-Defendant)
- Harold Hildebrand (Cross-Defendant)

**Events:**

- A business relationship led to the initiation of the action on April 2, 2021.
- Cross-complaint (XC) filed on April 25, 2023, alleging breach of contract, breach of contract, account stated, and goods and services rendered.
- Demurrer filed by Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants against XC on the grounds that it fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
- Meeting of the meet and confer requirement.

**Legal Standard:**

- A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law.
- The court accepts as true all material factual allegations and affords them a liberal construction.
- A demurrer will be sustained without leave to amend if there exists no reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment.
- When a complaint shows on its face that the cause of action alleged is barred by the statute of limitations, the plaintiff must plead facts which show an excuse, tolling, or some other basis for avoiding the statutory bar.

**Ruling:**

- The Demurrer was not timely filed with respect to Patience and Wander.
- The relation back doctrine tolls the statute of limitations on cross claims filed against a plaintiff, but it does not apply to cross-actions against codefendants or new parties.
- The court sustains the Demurrer with 20 days leave to amend.
- The moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.

**Significant Statements:**

- "To invoke an alter ego theory of liability, there must be: (1) such a unity of interest and ownership between the corporation and its equitable owner that the separate personalities of the corporation and the shareholder do not in reality exist; and (2) an inequitable result if the acts in question are treated as those of the corporation alone."
- "A claim based upon an alter ego theory is not itself a claim for substantive relief. It is a procedural device by which courts will disregard the corporate entity in order to hold the alter ego individual liable on the obligations of the corporation."
