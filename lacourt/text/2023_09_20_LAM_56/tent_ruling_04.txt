  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL

Time: 8:30 a.m.

Jury Trial: Not set
 
 



 
MOVING PARTY: Farah Faramarzi (“Faramarzi”)
 
On
August 17, 2023, Faramarzi filed a motion to be relieved as Plaintiff’s counsel
(the “Motion”).  The Motion is compliant
with California Rules of Court,
rule 3.1362.  The Motion is
unopposed.  Any opposition papers were
required to have been filed and served at least nine court days before the
hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005,
subdivision (b).
 
DISCUSSION
The
court has discretion on whether to allow an attorney to withdraw, and a motion
to withdraw will not be granted where withdrawal would prejudice the
client.  (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  
 
In
support of the Motion, Faramarzi declares that there has been a breakdown of
the attorney/client relationship.  The
Court finds this to be an adequate basis for withdrawal.  For this reason and because it is unopposed,
the Court GRANTS the Motion.  (Sexton v. Superior Court (1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)    
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If
the department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar. 
 
     Dated this 20th day of September 2023
