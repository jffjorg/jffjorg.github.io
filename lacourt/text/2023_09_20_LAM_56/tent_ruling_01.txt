AND RELATED CROSS-ACTION
 
MOVING PARTY: Plaintiffs/Cross-Defendants
Patience and Fortitude, Inc. (“Patience”) and Wander and Ponder (“Wander”); and
Cross-Defendants Kalie Caldwell (“Caldwell”) and Harold Hildebrand
(“Hildebrand”) (collectively, “Moving Cross-Defendants”)
 
RESPONDING PARTY: Defendant/Cross-Complainant
Move Sales, Inc. (“MSI”)
 
The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers.
 
BACKGROUND
This action, which was initiated on April 2,
2021, arises out of a business relationship. 
The cross-complaint (the “XC”), filed on April 25, 2023, alleges: (1)
breach of contract; (2) breach of contract; (3) account stated; and (4) goods
and services rendered.  Moving Cross-Defendants
filed a demurrer (the “Demurrer”) to the XC on the grounds that the XC fails to
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.
 
DISCUSSION
Meet and Confer
The meet and confer requirement has been
met.  
 
Legal Standard
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a complaint
as a matter of law.  (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.)  The court
accepts as true all material factual allegations and affords them a liberal
construction, but it does not consider conclusions of fact or law, opinions,
speculation, or allegations contrary to law or judicially noticed facts.  (Shea
Homes Limited Partnership v. County of Alameda (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1246,
1254.)  With respect to a demurrer, the
complaint must be construed liberally by drawing reasonable inferences from the
facts pleaded.  (Rodas v. Spiegel (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 513, 517.)  A demurrer will be sustained without leave to
amend if there exists no reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by
amendment.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.)   
 
When a complaint shows on its face or on the
basis of judicially noticed facts that the cause of action alleged therein is
barred by the statute of limitations, the plaintiff must plead facts which show
an excuse, tolling, or some other basis for avoiding the statutory bar.  (Ponderosa Homes, Inc. v. City of San
Ramon (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 1761, 1768.) 
To invoke the delayed discovery doctrine in order to stop the accrual of
the statute of limitations, a plaintiff must plead: (1) facts showing
reasonable diligence; and (2) the time and manner of discovery.  (WA Southwest 2, LLC v. First American
Title Ins. Co. (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 140, 156-57.)  The delayed discovery doctrine only delays
accrual until the plaintiff has, or should have, inquiry notice of the cause of
action.  (Id.)  In assessing the
sufficiency of the allegations of delayed discovery, the court places the burden on the plaintiff to show diligence; conclusory
allegations will not withstand demurrer. 
(Fox v. Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc.
(2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 808.)

 
            As
a preliminary matter, the Demurrer was not timely filed with respect to
Patience and Wander, as both filed answers to the XC on June 14, 2023.
 
Timeliness of XC/Alter-Ego Liability
The relation back doctrine tolls the statute
of limitations on cross claims filed against a plaintiff, but the doctrine does
not apply to cross-actions against codefendants or new parties.  (See Boyer v. Jensen (2005) 129
Cal.App.4th 62, 70.) 
 
Ordinarily, a corporation is regarded as a
legal entity, separate and distinct from its stockholders, officers and
directors, with separate and distinct liabilities and obligations. (Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court
(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 523, 538.)  The
corporate form will be disregarded only in narrowly defined circumstances and
only when the ends of justice so require. (Mesler
v. Bragg Management Co. (1985) 39 Cal.3d 290, 301.)  To invoke an alter ego theory of liability,
there must be: (1) such a unity of interest and ownership between the
corporation and its equitable owner that the separate personalities of the
corporation and the shareholder do not in reality exist; and (2) an inequitable
result if the acts in question are treated as those of the corporation
alone.  (Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court,
supra, 83 Cal.App.4th
at 538.)  To recover on an alter ego
theory, a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to show a unity of interest
and ownership, and an unjust result if the corporation is treated as the sole
actor.  (A.J. Fistes Corp. v. GDL Best
Contractors, Inc. (2019) 38 Cal.App.5th 677, 696.)  A claim based upon an alter ego theory is not
itself a claim for substantive relief.  (Leek
v. Cooper (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th 399, 418.) 
It is a procedural device by which courts will disregard the corporate
entity in order to hold the alter ego individual liable on the obligations of
the corporation.  (Id. at 419.)
 
The Demurrer argues that the claims against
Caldwell and Hildebrand fail because they are time-barred and do not allege a
basis for imposing alter-ego liability.  The
XC is based in alleged contractual breaches that occurred in 2017 and 2018 and
the claims are therefore time-barred unless the claims against Caldwell and
Hildebrand relate back to the date that Plaintiffs initiated the action under
an alter ego theory.  The XC alleges that
Caldwell and Hildebrand are the cofounders of Patience and Wander, and that
Patience and Wander were functionally the same entity.  (See XC ¶¶ 4-6.)  These allegations may show a unity of interest
between Patience and Wander, but do not sufficiently allege a basis for
alleging the personal liability of either Caldwell or Hildebrand.  The Court therefore SUSTAINS the Demurrer
with 20 days leave to amend. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice of
this ruling.
