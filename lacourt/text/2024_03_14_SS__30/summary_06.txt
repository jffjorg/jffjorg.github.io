Here is a summary in English text of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to set aside the dismissal of the case. The case was dismissed for failure to prosecute, and the plaintiff's counsel failed to appear at the OSC hearing and failed to file responsive paperwork. The plaintiff argued that the case was dismissed due to their counsel's inadvertence, mistake, and neglect, but the judge found that the mandatory relief provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b) is unavailable because the case was dismissed for failure to prosecute. The judge also found that the discretionary provision of section 473 is unavailable because the plaintiff failed to show excusable neglect and failed to make the motion within a reasonable time. The judge concluded that the court acted well within its discretion in dismissing the case for failure to prosecute.
