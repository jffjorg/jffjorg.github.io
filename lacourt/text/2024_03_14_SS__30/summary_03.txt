And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Gabriel Nateras vs. Natalie Obradavich, et al. The Defendant, Natalie Obradavich, has moved to compel responses to special interrogatories, set two, and request for production of documents, set two, which were served on the Plaintiff, Kelly Vitale, on October 25, 2023. The Plaintiff's discovery responses were due on or around November 28, 2023, but no verified responses have been served. The Judge finds that the Defendant is entitled to a court order directing the Plaintiff to provide verified responses without objections to the discovery requests. Therefore, the motions are granted.

The Defendant also requested sanctions, but the Judge denies this request as the motions were not opposed. Additionally, the Judge denies the request for sanctions under CCP section 2023.010 for the misuse of discovery, citing a previous case that states that these sections do not independently authorize the trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.

In conclusion, the Defendant's motions to compel responses to special interrogatories and request for production of documents are granted, and the Plaintiff is ordered to provide verified responses without objections to the discovery requests within 20 days of this order. The Defendant's request for sanctions is denied.
