And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff Iam Miller's Motion to Vacate Judgment. The motion was filed on March 13, 2024, but is untimely, as the 15-day deadline to file such a motion passed on March 6, 2024. On the merits, the motion fails to demonstrate that the legal basis for the decision is not consistent with or supported by the facts. Plaintiff's arguments, which include denial of a trial by jury, lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and legal advice given to Defendant, are all unrelated to the legal basis for the decision. Therefore, the motion is denied.
