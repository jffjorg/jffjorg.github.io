And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The court has granted State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company's (State Farm) motion to compel Daniel Montes to respond to discovery requests, including form interrogatories and a request for production of documents. The court has also granted State Farm's request for sanctions against Montes and his counsel in the amount of $523.30, which includes $261.65 in attorney fees and $61.65 in costs. The court has ordered Montes to serve verified responses to the discovery requests within 20 days of the order, and Montes and his counsel are required to pay the sanctions within 20 days of the order.

In its ruling, the court noted that State Farm propounded the discovery requests in November 2023, and Montes failed to respond in a timely manner. The court also noted that there is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort before filing a motion to compel initial responses, and that the motion can be brought at any time after the responding party fails to provide the responses.

The court cited California Insurance Code section 11580.2 and Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030.290 and 2031.300 in support of its ruling. The court also cited Miranda v. 21st Century Insurance Co. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 913, 923, which held that discovery may be conducted both before and after the commencement of an uninsured motorist arbitration proceeding.
