Significant Statements:

  - "Ultimate discovery sanctions are justified where there is a willful discovery order violation, a history of abuse, and evidence showing that less severe sanctions would not produce compliance with discovery rules."
  - "A penalty as severe as dismissal or default is not authorized where noncompliance with discovery is caused by an inability to comply rather than willfulness or bad faith."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted defendant Tonika Murray's motion for terminating and monetary sanctions, dismissing plaintiff Bobby Foster's complaint with prejudice. The judge has also awarded defendant Tonika Murray monetary sanctions of $1,361.65, to be paid within 20 days of notice of this order. The judge found that plaintiff's failure to comply with the discovery order, despite notice of the court's ruling, demonstrates a pattern of abuse and a lack of good faith. The judge also found that plaintiff's failure to serve responses to interrogatories and requests for production, and to pay sanctions, justifies the imposition of terminating sanctions. The judge noted that the court is not required to allow a pattern of abuse to continue indefinitely.
