ANALYSIS:
 
Petitioner State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company
(“Petitioner”) propounded Form Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, on Respondent Daniel Montes (“Respondent”) on
November 15, 2023, in connection with an uninsured motorist arbitration
proceeding. (Motions, Trostler Decl., Exh. A.) Following Respondent’s failure
to provide timely responses, Petitioner extended the deadline to serve verified
responses until January 31, 2024. (Id. at Exhs. B-D.) Following no
response from Respondent after the last deadline, Petitioner filed the instant
(1) Motion Compelling Respondent
Daniel Montes to Respond to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion Compelling Respondent
Daniel Montes to Respond to Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, on February
13, 2024. No oppositions have been filed to date.
 
Discussion
 
Discovery may be conducted both before and after the
commencement of an uninsured / underinsured motorist arbitration proceeding.
(Cal. Ins. Code, § 11580.2, subd. (f); Miranda v. 21st Century Insurance Co.
(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 913, 923.) The discovery statutes of the Code of Civil
Procedure apply to uninsured / underinsured motorist arbitration proceedings.
(Cal. Ins. Code, § 11580.2, subd. (f)(2).)
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) The motion can be brought any time after the responding party fails
to provide the responses. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, 2031.300.) Based on their
failure to respond to the propounded discovery, Petitioner is entitled to an
order compelling Respondent to serve verified responses to the form
interrogatories, and requests for production, without objections. 
 
Respondent’s failure to timely respond to the requests
constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010,
subd. (d).) Sanctions are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections
2023.010 and 2023.030 and have been properly noticed. However, the amount
sought is excessive for these unopposed Motions. Therefore, the requests for
sanctions are granted against Defendant and counsel of record in the amount of
$261.65 per motion, based on one hour of attorney time billed at $200.00 an
hour, plus $61.65 in costs. (Motions, Trostler Decl., ¶9.) The sanctions are to
be paid within 20 days’ service of this order.
 
Conclusion
 
Petitioner State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company’s (1) Motion Compelling Respondent
Daniel Montes to Respond to Form
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions; and (2) Motion Compelling Respondent
Daniel Montes to Respond to Request for
Production of Documents, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, are GRANTED. RESPONDENT
