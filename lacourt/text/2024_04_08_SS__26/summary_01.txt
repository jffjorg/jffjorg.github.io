And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Judgment Creditor Andrew Krain's Motion to Compel Third Party Production of Documents. The motion sought to compel third parties to produce documents related to Judgment Debtor Alina Grygoryshyna and her husband Sammy Hakim. The judge found that the documents sought were overly broad and constituted a fishing expedition. The judge also denied Hakim's request for a protective order regarding his testimony.

The judge's ruling is based on the fact that the documents sought by the subpoena directed to Hakim are not directly relevant to the action and are overly broad. The judge also found that the information sought must be directly relevant to the action and that the competing interests of privacy and discovery must be carefully balanced.

The judge's ruling is consistent with California law, which requires that discovery of financial information meet a higher standard than typical discovery. The judge's ruling is also consistent with previous cases that have held that discovery of financial information must be directly relevant to the action and that the competing interests of privacy and discovery must be carefully balanced.
