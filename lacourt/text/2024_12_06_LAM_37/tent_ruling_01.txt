Background
 
On
September 20, 2023, The People of the State of California, acting by and
through the Department of Transportation (“Plaintiff”) filed this Unlawful
Detainer action against Apex Development Inc. (“Apex”); Anthony Now Aid; MCA
Trucking, Pacific Express Pallets; (collectively “Defendants”) and Does 1 to
20. 
On
June 11, 2024, Defendant Apex Development filed a Cross-Complaint (“CC”)
against Plaintiff asserting two causes of action: (1) Quasi Contract –
Restitution; and (2) Intentional Interface with Contract.
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant now demurs to the Cross-Complaint. The demurrer
remains unopposed. The matter is now before the court.
request
for JUDICIAL notice
 
The court may
take judicial notice of “official acts of the legislative, executive, and
judicial departments of the United States and of any state of the United
States,” “[r]ecords of (1) any court of this state or (2) any court of record
of the United States or of any state of the United States,” and “[f]acts and
propositions that are not reasonably subject to dispute and are capable of
immediate and accurate determination by resort to sources of reasonably
indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code § 452(c), (d), and (h).) “Taking
judicial notice of a document is not the same as accepting the truth of its
contents or accepting a particular interpretation of its meaning.” (Joslin v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 369, 374.)
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
requests judicial notice of the following: 
 
Exhibit 1:
Written lease agreement, executed on June 18, 2008, between Apex Development,
Inc. and the State of California, Department of Transportation [Caltrans], for
Airspace Lease Area No. 07-LAX010- 0012-05.
 
As Exhibit 1 is referenced in
the Cross-Complaint, the court may take judicial notice of the existence of
Exhibit 1. (Scott v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 743,
753-754.) The request for judicial notice is granted. 
 
Demurrer[1]
 
I.         Legal Standard
 
Where pleadings are defective, a party may raise the defect
by way of a demurrer. (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d 257, 262.) A
demurrer tests the sufficiency of a pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer
must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters.¿
(CCP, § 430.30(a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) In
evaluating a demurrer, the court accepts the complainant’s properly pled facts
as true and ignores contentions, deductions, and conclusory statements. (Daar
v. Yellow Cab Co. (1976) 67 Cal.2d 695, 713; Serrano v. Priest (1971)
5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) Moreover, the court does not consider whether a plaintiff
will be able to prove the allegations or the possible difficulty in making such
proof. (Fisher v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d
590, 604.) 
Leave to amend must be allowed
where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿ The burden is on the complainant to
show the Court that a pleading can be amended successfully. (Ibid.)
 
II.        Discussion
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant
demurs to the first and second causes of action in the Cross-Complaint on the
basis the facts are insufficient to constitute a cause of action. 
 
First, Plaintiff asserts that
the first cause of action for quantum meruit causes of action are specifically
not allowed against government entities like CalTrans. (Gov. Code, §§ 811.2;
13975.) “[A]n  action for quantum meruit
may not be maintained against the government, as a matter of law.” (Lundeen
Coatings Corp. v. Department of Water & Power (1991) 232 Cal.App.3d
816, 834.) “As a general rule, a public entity cannot be sued on an implied in
law or quasi-contract theory, because such a theory is based on quantum meruit
or restitution considerations which are outweighed by the need to protect and
limit a public entity's contractual obligations.” (Id. at p. 834, fn.
9.) 
 
As the demurrer remains
unopposed, the demurrer to the first cause of action is sustained without leave
to amend. 
 
Second, Plaintiff also asserts
the first and second causes of action are common law causes of action not based
in statute, and a public entity like CalTrans cannot be held liable pursuant to
the Government Claims Act. “The basic architecture of the Act is encapsulated
in Government Code section 815. Subdivision (a) of that section makes clear
that under the GCA, there is no such thing as common law tort liability for
public entities; a public entity is not liable for an injury ‘[e]xcept as
otherwise provided by statute.’” (Quigley v. Garden Valley Fire Protection
Dist. (2019) 7 Cal.5th 798, 803 citing Gov. Code § 835(a).) 
 
The Cross-Complaint alleges
that Daryl Myatt, a right-of-way agent for Caltrans, was aware Apex Development
had a written rental agreement for storage with Apex Tenants, but Myatt came to
the Subject Property on numerous occasions to advise and instruct Apex’s
tenants not to pay rent as CalTrans intended to evict Apex from the Subject
Property. (CC, ¶¶ 25, 126.). As a result of Myatt’s and CalTrans’ interference,
Apex’s tenants stopped paying rent. (Id. ¶ 27.) The Cross-Complaint
asserts that Myatt, as a public employee, can be held liable for his action
under Gov. Code § 820(a) and Caltrans can be held proximately liable under Gov.
Code § 815.2(a) because Myatt was acting within the scope of his employment. (Id.
¶ 28.) 
 
Plaintiff fails to explain why
CalTrans cannot be held vicariously liable for the acts or omissions of its
employee, Myatt. “Vicarious liability is a primary basis for liability on the
part of a public entity, and flows from the responsibility of such an entity
for the acts of its employees under the principle of respondeat superior. “ (Zelig
v. County of Los Angeles (2002) 27 Cal.4th 1112, 1128.) 
 
As Plaintiff fails to explain
why Myatt and CalTrans cannot be held liable under Gov. Code §§ 820(a) and
815.2(a), the demurrer to the second cause of action is overruled. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant’s demurrer is
sustained without leave to amend as to the first cause of 
action and overruled as to the second
cause of action. Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant must file an 
Answer by December 16, 2024.  An OSC Re: Answer and Case Management
Conference is set 
for January 15, 2025, at 8:30 a.m.  Moving party to give notice.
