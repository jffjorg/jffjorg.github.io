HEARING:  12/13/24 
 
#12
TENTATIVE ORDER
 
Defendants’ Motion to Set Aside Default and Vacate
Default Judgment pursuant to CCP §473(d) or its Inherent Power; To Vacate the
Renewal of Judgment pursuant to CCP §683.170(d) and For Leave to Defend the
Instant Lawsuit is DENIED.  
 
Moving party(s) to give notice. 
 
Plaintiff loaned $346,000 to Defendants on July 20, 2004
pursuant to a written agreement. 
Defendants were obligated to pay 10% interest on the loan, make monthly
interest payments and pay off the balance by July 31, 2007.  Defendants failed to make the monthly
payments or to pay the outstanding loan balance on July 31, 2007.  
 
On September 4, 2007, Plaintiff filed this action against
Defendants Abel Orozco and Athala Orozco. 
Plaintiff alleged a single cause of action for breach of contract.  
 
On November 1, 2007, default was entered against Defendants
Abel and Athala Orozco.  On July 8, 2008,
default judgment was entered against Defendants in the amount of $456,508.  On June 21, 2018, a renewal of judgment was
issued in the amount of $908,668.58.
 
On February 7, 2024, Defendants filed a motion to set aside
default and default judgment.  On July
17, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion.  On July 24, 2024, Defendants filed a reply. 
 
On July 31, 2024, the Court continued the hearing on
Defendants’ motion to set aside default to October 30, 2024.  
 
Defendants’ Request for Judicial Notice
 
          Defendants’
Request for Judicial Notice is DENIED. 
Defendants request that the Court take judicial notice of documents
irrelevant to the issues presented by this motion.  
 
Judgments void on their face
 
Default judgments that are void on their face may be vacated
at any time under section 473(d). “A judgment or order that is invalid on the
face of the record is subject to collateral attack. It follows that it may be
set aside on motion, with no limit on the time within which the motion must be
made.”  (Trackman v. Kenney (2010)
187 Cal.App.4th 175, 181.)  
 
Default judgment void for lack of proper service  
 
“Compliance with the statutory procedures for service of
process is essential to establish personal jurisdiction.  Thus, a default judgment entered against a
defendant who was not served with a summons in the manner prescribed by statute
is void.  Under section 473, subdivision
(d), the court may set aside a default judgment which is valid on its face, but
void, as a matter of law, due to improper service.”  (Ellard v. Conway (2001) 94
Cal.App.4th 540, 544.)  “When a court
lacks jurisdiction in a fundamental sense, an ensuing judgment is void, and
thus vulnerable to direct or collateral attack at any time.”  (Strathvale Holdings v. E.B.H. (2005)
126 Cal.App.4th 1241, 1249 (trial court properly granted motion for relief from
default and default judgment based on CCP §473(d) where defendants argued there
was no valid service of process and they lacked minimum contacts with CA;
defendants were not required to file a motion to quash and plaintiff failed to
meet its initial burden of establishing proper service and jurisdiction over
defendants).)  
 
A defendant may therefore move to set aside a default and
default judgment based on improper service and lack of personal jurisdiction
under CCP §473(d).  (Id. at 1250.)  A defendant need not bring a motion to quash
prior to or in conjunction with a motion for relief from default and default
judgment pursuant to CCP §473(d).  (Id.)
 
It is always the plaintiff’s burden to establish the
existence of jurisdiction.  (Id.
at 1250-1251; Dill v. Berquist Const. Co., Inc. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th
1426, 1439-1440.)  Thus, even though
defendant is the moving party on a motion to quash or a motion to set aside a
void judgment per CCP §473(d), the burden is on plaintiff to establish proper
service.  (Dill, supra, 24
Cal.App.4th at 1439-1440.)  A valid proof
of service gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of valid service.  (Id. at 1441-1442.)
 
The statutory requirements of service are construed to
uphold jurisdiction, rather than defeat it. (Pasadena Medi-Center Associates
v. Sup.Ct. (Houts) (1973) 9 Cal.3d 773, 778.)  As long as the defendant receives actual
notice of the lawsuit, substantial compliance with the Code provisions
governing service of summons will generally be held sufficient.  (Id.)
 
Vacation of Renewal of Judgment
 
A “renewal of judgment…may be vacated on any ground that
would be a defense to an action on the judgment, including the ground that the
amount of the renewed judgment as entered pursuant to this article is
incorrect, and shall be vacated if the application for renewal was filed within
five years from the time the judgment was previously renewed….”  (CCP §683.170(a).)  

“Not later than 60 days after service of the notice of renewal…the judgment
debtor may apply by noticed motion under this section for an order of the court
vacating the renewal of the judgment. 
The notice of motion shall be served on the judgment creditor. Service
shall be made personally or by mail.” 
(CCP §683.170(b).)  
 
Upon hearing of the motion, the renewal may be vacated upon
any ground in subdivision (a), and another and different renewal may be
entered, including, but not limited to, the renewal of the judgment in a
different amount if the decision of the court is that the judgment creditor is
entitled to renewal in a different amount.”
 
“The judgment debtor bears the burden of proving, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that he or she is entitled to relief under
section 683.170.”  (Fidelity Creditor
Service, Inc. v. Browne (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 195, 199.)  “Defective service of process is a defense
which may be raised on a motion to vacate renewal of a judgment.”  (Id. at 203 (debtor’s uncontradicted
assertion that he was never served with summons and complaint was proper ground
to vacate renewal of judgment).)  
 
Defendants' Motion to Vacate or Set Aside the Default and
Default Judgment
 
Defendants argue the default entered against them on November
1, 2007 and the default judgment entered on July 8, 2008 should be set aside
pursuant to CCP §473(d).  Defendants
argue the complaint and summons were never served on them and the default and
default judgment are void.  
 
When the instant motion was filed on February 7, 2024, the
applicable law provided that a motion for relief from a judgment valid on its
face but void for improper service, is governed by analogy to CCP §473.5.  Thus, relief must be sought no later than 2
years after entry of the default judgment, sooner if notice is given.  (Rogers v. Silverman (1989) 216
Cal.App.3d 1114, 1121-1122 (process server served wrong person).) Here, default
judgment was entered on November 1, 2007, approximately 17 years before
Defendants filed their motion to set aside the default and default judgment
entered against them.  Under the Rogers
rule, the instant motion was untimely.  
 
However, after the parties briefed the matter, the
California Supreme Court issued its opinion in California Capital Ins. Co.
v. Hoehn (November 18, 2024, S277510) __ Cal.5th ___.  There, the Court disapproved of Rogers
and held that a Section 473(d) motion to vacate a judgment that is void for
lack of proper service is not subject to the judicially imposed two-year
limitation. (Id., [p. 27] (italics added).) In light of California
Capital Ins. Co., and in the absence of any time limitation in Section
473(d), the Court finds that the instant motion is timely.  
 
As to the merits, Defendants argue the judgment is void on
its face because the judgment roll shows that the proof of service of the
summons is signed by Henry Valasquez, when that declarant’s true name is
Enrique Velasquez.
 
“A judgment is ... void on its face when the invalidity is
apparent upon an inspection of the judgment-roll.”  (Dill v. Berquist Construction Co.
(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1441.)  When
a default judgment has been entered, the judgment roll consists of “the
summons, with the affidavit or proof of service; the complaint; the request for
entry of default ..., and a copy of the judgment.”  (CCP §670(a).)  Whether a judgment is void “does not hinge on
evidence: A void judgment's invalidity appears on the face of the record,
including the proof of service.”  (Trackman,
supra, 187 Cal.App.4th at 181.)
 
The use of another name by the declarant on the declaration
of service does not render the judgment void on its face because such a claim
hinges on evidence.  Defendants’ evidence
fails to establish that the true name of the person who allegedly served them was
Enrique Valesquez.  Defendants testify
that their accountant’s name is Enrique Velasquez, but they fail to provide any
evidence that it was their accountant who signed the proof of service of
summons and complaint.  (Athala Orozco
Dec., ¶9; Abel Orozco Dec., ¶¶12-14.) 
Defendant Abel claims that Henry Velasquez’s real name is Enrique
Valesquez on “information and belief.”  (Abel
Orozco Dec., ¶13.)  Such testimony lacks
foundation and also fails to establish that the “Henry Valasquez” who signed
the proofs of service of the summons and complaint on the Defendants is Enrique
Valesquez, Defendants’ accountant.  As
such, the use of a false or incorrect name on the proof of service does not
render the judgment void on its face.  
 
Defendants also reference the Court’s “inherent power” to
set aside the default and default judgment. 
Defendants do not provide any authority holding the Court can void a
default and default judgment pursuant to its inherent power.  
 
Defendants' Motion to Set Aside or Void the Default and
Default Judgment pursuant to CCP §473(d) or the Court’s Inherent Power is
DENIED.
 
Defendants’ Request to Vacate the Renewal of Judgment
 
Defendants also move to vacate the renewal of judgment
issued on June 21, 2018.  Defendants
argue the renewal of judgment was never served on them.  Defendants also argue the renewal should be
vacated, because the underlying complaint and summons were never served on them
and the Court lacked jurisdiction to enter the default or default judgment.
 
Even assuming Plaintiff did not serve the renewal of
judgment, the failure to serve notice of renewal of the judgment is not grounds
to vacate the renewal.  “The only impact
of a lack of valid service of the notice of renewal under section 683.160 is
that the judgment creditor cannot initiate enforcement proceedings until the
debtor is served.  There is no specified
time period within which the renewal of judgment must be served on the judgment
debtor.”  (American Contractors
Indemnity Co., supra, 73 Cal.App.5th at 850.)
 
Defendants also argue the renewal of judgment must be
vacated, because they were never served with the complaint and summons.  Failure to serve a defendant with the
complaint and summons is grounds to vacate a renewal of judgment.  (Fidelity Creditor Service, Inc., supra,
89 Cal.App.4th at 203.)  
 
The proofs of service of the summons and complaint were
executed by “Henry Valasquez,” who was not a registered process server.  (Murphy Dec., Exs. 2 and 10, Proofs of
Service filed on 11/1/07.)  They indicate
personal service on both Defendants.  (Id.)
 
Defendant Athala denies being served with the complaint and
summons on September 7, 2007.  (Athala
Orozco Dec., ¶6.)  Athala states in her
declaration that the POS signed by “Henry Valesquez” was actually signed by
Enrique Valesquez, her accountant, and that the declaration is false and
fraudulent.  (Id.)
 
Defendant Abel also denies that he was personally served by
“Henry Valesquez,” his accountant whose true name is Enrique Valesquez, and
denies service specifically in 2008. 
However, the POS indicates personal service by “Henry Valasquez” on
September 7, 2007.  (Murphy Dec., Exs. 2
and 10, Proofs of Service filed on 11/1/07.) 
In addition, as discussed above, Defendants fail to establish that
“Henry Valasquez,” who executed the POSs, is Enrique Valesquez, their
accountant.  
 
In response to this evidence, Rocio Rosales, assignee of
Judgment Creditor Robert Hernandez, who is now purportedly deceased, claims (1)
the motion was never properly served on him and (2) Defendant Abel admitted
during the July 2019 trial in Case Number EC063851 that judgment had been
entered against him and his wife in this action.  
 
Rocio Rosales did not file a Notice of Assignment with the
Court.  Defendants did not serve Rosales
with notice of their motion, despite their knowledge that Rosales was the
assignee of Hernandez’s judgment in this action and had filed an adversary
action in Defendant Abel’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy case.  (Khang Dec., ¶3.)  Based on the undisputed evidence presented,
Rosales is the assignee of Hernandez and is entitled to notice of this motion.  (Rosales Dec., Ex. A.)  Defendants’ failure to serve Rosales with
notice of this motion is alone grounds to deny the motion.  
 
In addition, on the merits, Defendants fail to establish
that they were not served with the complaint and summons based on a
preponderance of the evidence. 
Defendants’ declarations make bare statements that they were not
served.  Their testimony regarding the
identity of the process server lacks foundation and fails to undermine the
credibility of the proofs of service signed by “Henry Valasquez.”  
 
Defendants’ credibility is undermined by their testimony
that they did not discover the existence of this judgment until December
2023.  (Abel Orozco Dec., ¶2 (“first time
I heard about this lawsuit was when I received a Complaint to Revoke Order
confirming my current Chapter 13 Bankruptcy”); Athala Orozco Dec., ¶3.)  According to the January 24, 2019 trial
transcript in EC063851, Defendant Abel admitted that he knew of the judgment
entered in this action against him and his wife on July 8, 2008.  (Aguila Dec., 76:11-15.)  
 
Defendants' Motion to Vacate the Renewal of Judgment
pursuant to CCP §683.170(d) is DENIED.
 
Defendants’ Motion to Set Aside Default and Vacate Default
Judgment pursuant to CCP §473(d) or its Inherent Power; To Vacate the Renewal
of Judgment pursuant to CCP §683.170(d) and For Leave to Defend the Instant
Lawsuit is DENIED.
