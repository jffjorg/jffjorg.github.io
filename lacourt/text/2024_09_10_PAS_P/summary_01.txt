```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, ruling that they did not have actual knowledge of the dog's vicious propensities and therefore did not have a duty to prevent the attack. The court found that the evidence presented by the defendants, including the lease agreement and witness testimony, showed that they did not have prior knowledge of the dog's behavior and did not permit animals to reside at the property. The court also ruled that the plaintiff failed to present any evidence to refute the defendants' claims and therefore could not show a triable issue of material fact.
