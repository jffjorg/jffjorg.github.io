Judge [Name]'s Tentative Ruling:

The judge has denied the motions to compel initial responses to form interrogatories and requests for admissions filed by Defendant/Cross-Complainant Heather Davis. The motions are deemed moot since the responses were untimely served on August 11, 2023. The judge finds that reasonable sanctions are warranted against Cross-Defendant Daniel Li for failing to timely respond to the discovery requests. The judge orders Cross-Defendant Daniel Li to pay Defendant/Cross-Complainant Heather Davis and her counsel of record reasonable sanctions in the total amount of $750.00 no later than 90 days from the issuance of this order. The date may be extended per agreement of the parties.
