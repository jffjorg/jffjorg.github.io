And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the Defendant's Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens and Request for Attorney's Fees. The Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens is deemed moot since the Plaintiff has dismissed the entire action without prejudice. The judge has also denied the Defendant's request for attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $6,521.96. The judge's decision is based on the fact that the Plaintiff has dismissed the entire action and the Defendant has not prevailed on the motion to expunge the lis pendens. The judge has also considered the practical approach of determining whether the moving party is the prevailing party under CCP §405.38 by analyzing the extent to which each party has realized its litigation objectives. The judge has concluded that the imposition of attorney's fees and costs are not warranted under section 405.38.
