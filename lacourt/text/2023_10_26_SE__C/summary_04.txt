Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the unopposed motions of Plaintiffs Katherine Rivera and Marbella Arredondo to deem their requests for admissions (RFAs) admitted against Defendant Santos M. De Jesus. The RFAs were propounded on December 6, 2022, and despite a unilateral extension of time granted by the Plaintiffs' counsel, the Defendant failed to provide responses. The court notes that the Defendant's failure to serve a timely response waived any objections to the RFAs and that sanctions are mandatory under California Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280(c). As a result, the Defendant is ordered to pay sanctions in the amount of $811.65 to both Plaintiffs and their counsel within 90 days.
