Here's a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrers to the Second Amended Complaint. The court has sustained the demurrers without leave to amend, except for the demurrers to the fourth and fifth causes of action, which are sustained with 10 days leave to amend.

The court has also granted the motions to strike portions of the Second Amended Complaint, finding that they are moot due to the court's ruling on the demurrers.

The court has denied the requests for judicial notice of certain exhibits, except for Exhibits A, B, and C, which were granted.

The court has allowed leave to amend the pleadings, finding that there is a reasonable probability that the defects can be cured by amendment.

The court has also ruled on various motions and demurrers, including a demurrer to the second cause of action for cancellation of instruments, which was sustained with 10 days leave to amend. The court has also ruled on a demurrer to the third cause of action for quiet title, which was sustained with 10 days leave to amend.

Overall, the court's tentative ruling is a significant development in the case, and it may impact the parties' ability to proceed with their claims and defenses.
