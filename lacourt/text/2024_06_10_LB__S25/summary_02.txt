Summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to reclassify the case as one of limited jurisdiction. The court finds that there is a possibility that the damages will exceed the $25,000.00 threshold, as the plaintiff has incurred medical expenses and claims ongoing treatment. The burden to defeat the motion is light, and the plaintiff has met that burden. The court will continue to review the record to determine whether a judgment in excess of $25,000.00 is obtainable.
