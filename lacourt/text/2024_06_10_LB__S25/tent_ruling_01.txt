  Case Number:  23LBCV01376    Hearing Date:   June 10, 2024    Dept:  S25 Procedural BackgroundOn July 24, 2023, Plaintiff Steven John Brooks, II, filed a complaint against Defendants Brown’s Bikes, Doe Bike Manufacturer, Doe Brake Manufacturer, Doe Distributor, and Does 1 to 50. In the complaint, Plaintiff alleges three causes of action: (1) strict products liability; (2) breach of warranty; and (3) negligence. On May 10, 2022, Plaintiff visited Defendant Brown’s Bikes store in Avalon, California and rented an electric bicycle (“bike”) identified as an Evelo Aurora Class 2. (Compl., ¶ 13.) While riding the bike, Plaintiff alleges that the front brakes failed to function and so only half of braking capability worked which caused Plaintiff to crash into the side of a hill, resulting Plaintiff suffering serious injuries. (Compl., ¶¶ 16, 19.) At the time of rental, an employee of Defendant Brown’s Bikes warned Plaintiff not to use the brake on the left side of the handlebar, but otherwise stated the bike was safe to use. (Compl., ¶ 18.)On December 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed two Doe Amendments; one of which identified Defendant as the “Doe Bike Manufacturer”. On or about January 18, 2024, Plaintiff filed his proof of service on Defendant by serving Defendant’s Registered Agent for Service of Process, Amy Osgood. (1/18/2024 Proof of Service, p.1.)On March 1, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion to strike. On March 4, 2024, Defendant filed a notice of errata in which it attached a missing declaration exhibit. The instant motion hearing was originally scheduled for October 8, 2024; however, this Court moved the hearing date to June 11, 2024. (3/12/2024 Minute Order.) On May 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On June 4, 2024, Defendant filed its reply.Meet and ConferDefendant has satisfied its meet and confer obligations.AnalysisA party may move to strike matters from an opposing party’s pleading if it is irrelevant, false or improper. (See Code Civ. Proc., §§ 435, 436, subd. (a).) Motion to strike may also targetall or any part of pleadings not filed or drawn in conformity with the applicable laws, rules or orders. (Code Civ. Proc., § 436, subd. (b).) A Motion to Strike is the proper procedure for testing the adequacy of a punitive damages allegation because punitive damages are not a cause of action. (Grieves v. Superior Ct. (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 164.)To obtain punitive damages in an action for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract, a plaintiff must demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the defendant is guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice. (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (a).) The clear and convincing evidence standard “requires a finding of high probability . . . ‘so clear as to leave no substantial doubt’; sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.” (Lackner v. North (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1188, 1211.)Fraud is defined as “an intentional misrepresentation, deceit or concealment of a material fact known to the defendant with the intention on the part of the defendant of thereby depriving a person of property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury.” (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(3).) Next, malice is defined as “conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.” (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(1).) Lastly, oppression is defined as “despicable conduct that subjects a person to cruel and unjust hardship in conscious disregard of that person’s rights.” (Civ. Code, § 3294, subd. (c)(2).) The adjective "despicable" connotes conduct that is ". . . so vile, base, contemptible, miserable, wretched or loathsome that it would be looked down upon and despised by ordinary decent people.” (Lackner, supra, 135 Cal.App.4th at p. 1210.) “Not only must there by circumstances of oppression, fraud or malice, but facts must be alleged in the pleading to support such a claim.” (Grieves, supra, 157 Cal.App.3d at p. 166.)The complaint does not state enough to warrant a claim for punitive damages. Conclusory allegations like Complaint ¶¶ 34 and 45 are insufficient.Tentative RulingDefendant’s motion to strike punitive damages is GRANTED with leave to amend within 20 days.
