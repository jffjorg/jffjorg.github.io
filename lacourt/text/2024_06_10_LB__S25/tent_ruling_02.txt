 Case Number:  23LBCV02287    Hearing Date:   June 10, 2024    Dept:  S25 BackgroundOn December 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a form-complaint against Defendants Travelodge Hotels, Inc., Wyndham Hotel Management, Inc., 2SNZ Group, Inc., and Does 1 to 50. Plaintiff alleges two causes of action: (1) general negligence and (2) premises liability. On December 8, 2021, at or near 1440 Pacific Coast Highway in Harbor City, California, Plaintiff alleges she slipped and fell in a bathroom due to water on the floor at Defendants’ premises. (Compl., p. 5.) Plaintiff asserts the water on the floor was due to water splashing from the shower or a defective, cracked, broken and/or deteriorated shower head. (Compl., p. 6.) Defendants filed an answer on February 9, 2024. On May 15, 2024, Defendants filed a motion to reclassify. On May 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On June 4, 2024, Defendants filed a reply.Legal StandardCode of Civil Procedure section 403.040 allows a defendant to file a motion for reclassification of an action within the time allowed for that party to respond to the initial pleadings. (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (a).) “A party may amend its pleading once without leave of court at any time before an answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is filed, or after a demurrer or motion to strike is filed if the amended pleading is filed and served no later than the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer or motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., § 472, subd. (a).) If the motion is made after the time for the defendant to respond to the pleading, the motion may only be granted if (1) the case is incorrectly classified; and (2) the plaintiff shows good cause for not seeking reclassification earlier. (Code Civ. Proc., § 403.040, subd. (b).)¿¿In Walker v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 270-271, the California Supreme Court held that a matter may be reclassified from unlimited to limited only if it appears to a legal certainty that the plaintiff's damages will necessarily be less than $25,000. (Walker v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d 257, 262, 270-271.) If there is a possibility that the damages will exceed $25,000.00, the case cannot be transferred to limited. (Ibid.) This high standard is appropriate in light of “the circumscribed procedures and recovery available inthe limited civil courts.” (Ytuarte v. Superior Court (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 266, 278.)¿¿ “[T]he court should reject the plaintiff's effort to reclassify the action as unlimited only when the lack of jurisdiction as an “unlimited” case is certain and clear.” (Id. at 279.) Plaintiff must present evidence to demonstrate a possibility that the damages will exceed $25,000.00 and the trial court must review the record to determine “whether a judgment in excess of $25,000.00 is obtainable.” (Ibid.) ¿DiscussionDefendants point to the limited amount of damages currently claimed: $395.00 in medical specials, $12,800 in claimed lost wages, unproven future medical bills, and no property damage. (Marqué Decl., ¶¶ 2,3; Exh. A; Exh. B, p. 17, 18, 20.) Plaintiff argues the motion is premature and unjust to grant the motion to reclassify this action as one of limited jurisdiction. Although Plaintiff she has currently incurred medical expenditures in the amount of $395.00, she declares she is still experiencing significant pain and remains under the care of medical professionals at Advanced Pain Management in Long Beach. (See Landau Decl. 1, ¶ 4.) Plaintiff asserts continued medical intervention the total damages from this incident will surpass the $25,000 limited jurisdiction damages threshold.Tentative RulingAs discovery is ongoing and Plaintiff’s assertions of ongoing, future treatment due to pain and suffering, there is a possibility that the damages will exceed $25,000.00. The burden to defeat the motion is light and Plaintiff has met that burden. Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to reclassify is denied.
