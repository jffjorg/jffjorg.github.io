Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has sustained the demurrer to the first amended complaint with leave to amend. The demurrer was filed by Defendant Kenneth Arnold Chesney, who argued that the causes of action failed to state facts sufficient to support a claim against him. The court agreed to sustain the demurrer to the seventh cause of action for vicarious liability, as there was no allegation that Defendant Chesney had knowledge of the fraudulent scheme prior to its completion or that the fraudulent acts were committed by an employee or agent of Chesney while acting within the scope of their employment. The court also sustained the demurrer to the eighth cause of action for inadequate warning, as there was no allegation that Defendant Chesney had knowledge of the scheme or had a duty to warn others of his employee's fraud.
