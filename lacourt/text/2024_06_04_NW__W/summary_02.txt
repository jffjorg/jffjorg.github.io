And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling grants Plaintiff's motion to compel Defendant Los Angeles Unified School District to provide further responses to requests for production of documents and special interrogatories. The court finds that Plaintiff has shown good cause warranting further production of documents and that the Defendant's objections are without merit. The court also finds that the requests are clear, limited in scope and time, and do not infringe on any asserted privilege.

The court grants the motion to compel further responses as to Request Nos. 1-12, 26-28, 31-32, and 49-51, and as to Special Interrogatories Nos. 16-18, 19-27, 29, and 30-35. The court denies the motion to compel further responses as to Request Nos. 39-41 and 43-46, and as to Special Interrogatory Nos. 1 and 9.
