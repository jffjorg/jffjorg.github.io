And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer to the complaint is overruled in part and sustained without leave to amend in part. The judge has found that the plaintiff's first cause of action for negligence is not so ambiguous that the defendants cannot reasonably respond. The judge has also found that the plaintiff's allegations of breach of contract and rescission are sufficient for the purposes of a demurrer. However, the judge has sustained the demurrer to the fourth cause of action for statutory abandonment, finding that the sections of the Business and Professions Code cited by the plaintiff do not provide for a private cause of action. Finally, the judge has overruled the demurrer to the complaint on the grounds of misjoinder, finding that the defendants are properly joined as defendants in the action.
