And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling is that the defendant Estate of William Streitch (deceased)â€™s motion to dismiss is GRANTED. The plaintiff, Dale Farley, and Lydiette Bailey, filed a complaint against the defendants, Estate of William Streitch (deceased), and Ingrid Streich, for general negligence and motor vehicle negligence. The complaint alleges that the defendants negligently owned and operated their vehicle, resulting in the death of Amanda Farley. The defendant argues that the plaintiff has improperly named the estate as a defendant, as the plaintiff has refused to limit the recovery to the policy limits. The court agrees with the defendant, stating that the plaintiff has not named a personal representative and the complaint seeks a judgment in excess of the policy limits. The court also notes that the complaint explicitly asserts a claim against the Estate, instead of the personal representative of the estate. Therefore, the motion to dismiss is granted, and the issue needs to be resolved before the case can proceed against the Estate.
