  Case Number:  20STCV08041    Hearing Date:   October 5, 2023    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
February 26, 2020, Plaintiffs Horacio Casillas, Kourtine Alexia Rae Scott, Ava
Blankevoort, and Camila Casillas filed this action against Defendants Ink Transportation LLC, Surjay Pandey, and Does 1-50 for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence. 
On
July 13, 2020, Defendants Ink
Transportation LLC and Surjay Pandey filed an answer. 
On
May 18, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a notice of settlement. 
On September
11, 2023, Petitioner Kandyce Lance (“Petitioner”) submitted a petition for approval
of minor’s compromise to be heard on October 5, 2023. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
Kandyce Lance asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending action of
Plaintiff Camila Casillas. 
DISCUSSION 
Attachment
11 to the petition states that the settlement consists of a lump-sum payment of $1,500.  However, item 10 of the petition states that the Defendants have
offered to pay Plaintiff Camila Casillas $1,150. 
The
petition requests attorney’s fees of $132.50 but this amount is less than 25% of the
gross settlement amount.  Counsel is not
required to accept more than $132.50 but the figure may be an error. 
The
Court denies the petition without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court
DENIES the petition to approve the compromise of the pending action of minor Camila
Casillas filed by Petitioner Kandyce Lance without prejudice. Petitioner is ordered to give notice of the Court's ruling.
