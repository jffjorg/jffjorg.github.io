And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has made a tentative ruling on the motion of Plaintiff's counsel, Sam Ryan Heidari, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was granted on the grounds that there has been a breakdown in communication between counsel and client, leading to the deterioration of the attorney-client relationship, which makes it impossible for counsel to effectively represent the client. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and the motion was granted without prejudice to the client or disruption to the orderly process of justice. The court orders counsel to file proof of service on the client of the order granting the motion to be relieved as counsel and to give notice of this ruling.
