BACKGROUND 
On
January 1, 2022, Plaintiff Marirose King (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint
against Defendants Alexandra McOwen (“Defendant”) and Does 1-25 for general negligence
and motor vehicle tort. 
On
June 2, 2022, the Court granted Specially Appearing Defendant’s motion to quash and quashed service of the summons and
complaint. 
On
July 21, 2023, Plaintiff’s counsel, Sam Ryan Heidari, filed a motion to be
relieved as counsel to be heard on August 17, 2023.  The Court continued the hearing on the motion
to October 5, 2023. 
No
trial date is currently set. 
COUNSEL’S REQUEST 
Plaintiff’s
counsel, Sam Ryan Heidari, requests to be relieved as counsel.  
LEGAL STANDARD 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1)
notice of motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of
Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a
declaration stating in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality
of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure
section 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code of Civil
Procedure section 284(1) (made on the Declaration in Support of Attorney's Motion
to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of
motion and motion, declaration, and proposed order on the client and all other
parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving
counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
The
court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw.  The motion should be granted if there is no
prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice.
(Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915.) 
DISCUSSION 
Plaintiff’s
counsel has submitted completed MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053 forms.  Counsel states there has been a breakdown in
communication resulting in the deterioration of the attorney-client relationship
which precludes counsel’s ability to effectively represent the client in this
matter.  Counsel states that he served
the client at her last known address and confirmed within the past 30 days that
the address is correct by mail, return receipt requested. 
The
Court grants the motion. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS Plaintiff’s counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel.  Counsel will be relieved upon filing proof of
service on the client of the Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel--Civil (Judicial Council form MC-053). 
Counsel
is ordered to give notice of this ruling.  Counsel is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within 5 days.
