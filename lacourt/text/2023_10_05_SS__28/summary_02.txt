```

And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling by the Judge denies the petition to approve the compromise of Plaintiff Aiden Daniels' claim. The Judge found that the petition lacks essential information, including a doctor's report and proof of appointment as guardian ad litem. Additionally, the petition contains inconsistent figures regarding medical expenses, and requests attorney's fees that exceed the typical 25% limit for cases involving minors. The Judge orders Petitioner Sequoia Wiley to revise the petition to address these issues and to ensure that all liens are resolved prior to seeking Court approval.
