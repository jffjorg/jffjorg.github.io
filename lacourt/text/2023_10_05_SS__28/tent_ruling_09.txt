 Case Number:  23STCV02116    Hearing Date:   October 5, 2023    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
January 31, 2023, Plaintiffs Damian Azaeb Hernandez, a
minor, and Santiago Aaron Hernandez, a minor, filed a complaint against
Defendants Gurtej Sinh Gill, Harbor Trucking, Ltd., and Does 1-100 for wrongful
death. 
On
August 2, 2023, Petitioner Steysi Irais Baeza (“Petitioner”)
filed petitions to approve a compromise of the claims of Damian Azaeb
Hernandez, age 8, and Santiago Aaron Hernandez, age 5 (“Claimants”). 
PETITIONER’S REQUESTS 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the petitions for minors’ compromise. 
DISCUSSION 
 The applications state that Petitioner
is Claimants’ mother.  She has not
been appointed guardian ad litem.  The Court
finds that Petitioner has authority to compromise Claimants’ claims under
Probate Code section 3500, subdivision (a)(2). 
 Petitioner’s counsel requests
a fee of 33¿% in each case. The Court typically does not award attorney’s fees
in excess of 25% in cases involving minors absent extraordinary efforts,
described with particularity, by counsel. Based on counsel’s declarations
attached to the petitions, the Court will award 30% of the settlements as
attorney’s fees. 
 Petitioner may submit revised
orders with a new attorney’s fee amount consistent with the Court’s order. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court GRANTS the petitions to approve the compromise of the claims of Plaintiffs
Damian Azaeb Hernandez, a minor, and Santiago Aaron Hernandez, a minor, filed
by Petitioner Steysi Irais Baeza, conditional on Petitioner submitting new
orders reducing the attorney’s fees to 30% of the gross settlement amounts. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
