 Case Number:  22STCV18680    Hearing Date:   October 5, 2023    Dept:  28 Having
considered the moving papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
June 8, 2022, Plaintiff Shawn Steven Yenis (“Plaintiff”)
filed a complaint against Defendants Abbe Christopher
Redin, Los Angeles Unified School District, and Does 1-100 for personal
injuries arising from a motor vehicle accident that occurred on April 21, 2021. 
On August
24, 2022, Defendants Abbe Christopher
Redin and Los Angeles Unified School District (“Defendants”) filed an answer. 
On
January 20, 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s counsel’s motion to be relieved
as counsel.  Plaintiff’s counsel was
relieved effective January 24, 2023. 
On
September 7, 2023, Defendants filed a motion for terminating sanctions.  Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
Trial
is set for December 6, 2023. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Defendants
request that the Court impose terminating sanctions on Plaintiff. 



LEGAL STANDARD  
 Code of Civil Procedure section
  2023.030 provides in part: 
 “To
  the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery
  method or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any
  affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may
  impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a
  misuse of the discovery process: 
 “(a)
  The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the
  misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or
  both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
  anyone as a result of that conduct. The court may also impose this sanction
  on one unsuccessfully asserting that another has engaged in the misuse of the
  discovery process, or on any attorney who advised that assertion, or on both.
  If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of this title, the
  court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one subject to the
  sanction acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances
  make the imposition of the sanction unjust. 
 *
  * *
 “(d)
  The court may impose a terminating sanction by one of the following orders: 
 “(1)
  An order striking out the pleadings or parts of the pleadings of any party
  engaging in the misuse of the discovery process. 
 “(2)
  An order staying further proceedings by that party until an order for discovery
  is obeyed. 
 “(3)
  An order dismissing the action, or any part of the action, of that party. 
 “(4)
  An order rendering a judgment by default against that party.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
  2023.030, subds. (a), (d).) 
 A violation of a discovery
  order supports the imposition of terminating sanctions. (Collison &
  Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.) Terminating
  sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court's
  orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 795-796 (Deyo).) 
 A terminating sanction is a
  "drastic measure which should be employed with caution." (Deyo,
  supra, 84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "A decision to order terminating
  sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful,
  preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
  sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court
  is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v. Tenet
  Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.) 
DISCUSSION




 On July 13, 2023, the Court
  granted Defendants’ unopposed motion to compel verified responses to form and
  special interrogatories and ordered Plaintiff to provide verified responses,
  without objections, by August 13, 2023. 
 On August 8, 2023, the
  Court: (1) granted Defendants’ unopposed motion to compel Plaintiff to
  respond to Defendants’ request for production of documents and ordered
  Plaintiff to provide verified responses and produce the documents,
  electronically stored information, and/or other things requested, without
  objections, by September 11, 2023, and (2) granted Defendants’ unopposed
  motion to deem admitted the matters specified in Defendants’ requests for
  admission. 
 Plaintiff did not comply
  with the Court’s July 13, 2023, order. 
  Defendants filed their motion for terminating sanctions before the
  deadline for Plaintiff to comply with the Court’s August 8, 2023 order. 
 Based on Plaintiff's failure to comply with the Court's July 13, 2023 order, the Court grants Defendants’
  motion for terminating sanctions and dismisses the case. Defendants do not request monetary sanctions.



CONCLUSION 
 The Court GRANTS the motion
for terminating sanctions filed by Defendants Abbe Christopher Redin and Los
Angeles Unified School District.  The
Court dismisses the complaint filed by Plaintiff Shawn Steven Yenis with prejudice under Code of Civil Procedure section
2023.030, subdivision (d)(3). 
 Moving parties are ordered to
give notice of this ruling.
