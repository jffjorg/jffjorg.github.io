Here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion for terminating sanctions filed by the defendants, Abbe Christopher Redin and Los Angeles Unified School District, against the plaintiff, Shawn Steven Yenis. The plaintiff failed to comply with two court orders, and the defendants filed a motion for terminating sanctions before the deadline for compliance. The Court finds that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the orders is a misuse of the discovery process and warrants the imposition of terminating sanctions. As a result, the Court grants the motion and dismisses the case with prejudice.
