LEGAL STANDARD 
      A.   Interrogatories 
 “Within 30 days after
  service of interrogatories, the party to whom the interrogatories are
  propounded shall serve the original of the response to them on the
  propounding party, unless on motion of the propounding party the court has
  shortened the time for response, or unless on motion of the responding party
  the court has extended the time for response.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260.)  
 “If
  a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely
  response, the following rules apply: 
 “(a)
  The party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to
  exercise the option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as
  any objection to the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on
  the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section
  2018.010). The court, on motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on
  its determination that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
 “(1)
  The party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial
  compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240. 
 “(2)
  The party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,
  inadvertence, or excusable neglect. 
 “(b)
  The party propounding the interrogatories may move for an order compelling
  response to the interrogatories. 
 “(c)
  The court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with
  Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully
  makes or opposes a motion to compel a response to interrogatories, unless it
  finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with substantial
  justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction
  unjust. If a party then fails to obey an order compelling answers, the court
  may make those orders that are just, including the imposition of an issue
  sanction, an evidence sanction, or a terminating sanction under Chapter 7
  (commencing with Section 2023.010). In lieu of or in addition to that
  sanction, the court may impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
  (commencing with Section 2023.010).” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
  2030.290.) 
          B.   Discovery
  sanctions 
          “The court may impose a monetary sanction ordering that
  one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any attorney advising
  that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees,
  incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct. The court may also impose
  this sanction on one unsuccessfully asserting that another has engaged in the
  misuse of the discovery process, or on any attorney who advised that
  assertion, or on both. If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision
  of this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the
  one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that
  other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (a).) 
 “Misuses of the discovery
  process include, but are not limited to . . . 
 *
  * *
 “(d) Failing to respond or
  to submit to an authorized method of discovery.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
  2023.010, subd. (d).) 
DISCUSSION

 On
May 12, 2023, Defendant served special interrogatories, set one, and form interrogatories,
set one, on Plaintiff.  Responses were
due on July 17, 2023.  On July 27, 2023,
and August 14, 2023, Defendant emailed Plaintiff’s attorney asking Plaintiff to
respond to the discovery requests within 10 days. Plaintiff had not served
responses by the time Defendant filed these motions. 
 The Court grants Defendant’s motions and orders
Plaintiff to provide code-compliant verified responses to the special
interrogatories and form interrogatories without objections by November 3,
2023. 
 Defendant requests sanctions of $1,123.30 based on 4
hours of attorney time to prepare the motions at a billing rate of $250 per
hour and $123.30 in filing fees. 
 The motions were substantially similar, they were unopposed,
and they will be heard together.  The Court
grants sanctions of $623.30 based on two hours of attorney time plus two filing
fees of $61.65. 
CONCLUSION

Court GRANTS Defendant Margaret Mary Lewis’s motion to compel responses to form
interrogatories, set one, and orders Plaintiff Malvina Mkhchyan to provide
code-compliant verified responses to the form interrogatories without objections by November
3, 2023.
