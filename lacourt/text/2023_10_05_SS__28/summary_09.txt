And here is a summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to petitions filed by Steysi Irais Baeza, the mother of Damian Azaeb Hernandez and Santiago Aaron Hernandez, seeking approval of a compromise of their wrongful death claims. The Judge finds that Baeza has authority to compromise the claims under Probate Code section 3500 and grants the petitions conditional on Baeza submitting revised orders reducing the attorney's fees to 30% of the gross settlement amounts. The Judge also awards 30% of the settlements as attorney's fees, which is lower than the requested 33%.
