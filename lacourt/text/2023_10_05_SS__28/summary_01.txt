The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case 20STCV08041, which was filed by Plaintiffs Horacio Casillas, Kourtine Alexia Rae Scott, Ava Blankevoort, and Camila Casillas against Defendants Ink Transportation LLC, Surjay Pandey, and Does 1-50. The petition was filed by Kandyce Lance, the guardian of minor Camila Casillas, to approve a compromise of the pending action. The settlement consists of a lump-sum payment of $1,500, but the Defendants have offered to pay Plaintiff Camila Casillas $1,150. The petition also requests attorney's fees of $132.50, which is less than 25% of the gross settlement amount. The Court denies the petition without prejudice, meaning that the Petitioner can re-file the petition with the required information.
