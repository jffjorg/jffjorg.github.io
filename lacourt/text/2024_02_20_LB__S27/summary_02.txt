And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has seen a significant increase in motions to compel further responses and PMK depositions in lemon law cases, which are causing delays and unnecessary attorneys' fees. The judge finds that counsel can easily resolve these issues by meeting and conferencing in good faith, but instead, they are failing to do so and incurring additional fees. The judge notes that the case is set to go to trial in just 13 days, which is too close to the deadline for discovery motions, so the motion is summarily denied. The judge suggests that if the trial date is continued and the parties agree to reopen the discovery cut-off, the hearing will be reopened and the parties will be required to meet and confer with the threat of sanctions in mind.
