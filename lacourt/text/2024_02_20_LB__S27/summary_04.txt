And here is the summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge is ruling on several demurrers and motions to strike filed by the defendants in this case. The plaintiffs, John and Jane Doe, filed a complaint against several defendants alleging negligence, strict liability, false representation, intentional tort, and loss of consortium. The crux of the complaint is that the plaintiff, a Customs and Border Patrol agent, was exposed to dangerous levels of radiation due to the use of an x-ray scanner made by Smiths Detection Inc. and now has thyroid cancer.

The defendants are seeking to dismiss the complaint on various grounds, including the Privette doctrine, lack of jurisdiction, and failure to plead with sufficient specificity. The Judge notes that the Privette doctrine does not apply to the case because the defendants did not hire the plaintiff as an independent contractor.

The Judge grants the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages and related allegations filed by Pacific Maritime Services and Stadco LA, LLC. The Judge also sustains the demurrer filed by Smiths Detection Inc. and grants leave to amend if the plaintiff can plead specific affirmative representations that were false.

The Judge orders the plaintiffs to submit an amended complaint within 20 days and sets a deadline for the defendants to file responsive pleadings. The Judge also orders the parties to meet and confer in good faith if any party intends to challenge the amended pleading.
