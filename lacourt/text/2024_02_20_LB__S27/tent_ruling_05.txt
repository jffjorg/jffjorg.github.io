 Case Number:  23LBCV01887    Hearing Date:   February 20, 2024    Dept:  S27 Plaintiff, Albert Villa, Jr., by
and through his attorney, William H. Shibley, filed this action against
Defendant, Robert Schiller on 9/13/23.  To date, Plaintiff has not served Defendant
with the summons and complaint.  
 
On 1/22/24, Plaintiff’s attorney
filed this motion to be relieved as counsel. 
He declares he received communication from David Ostrove, who indicated
he was now representing Plaintiff such that Shibley should cease representation
efforts.  To date, despite Shibley’s request,
Ostrove has not filed a substitution of attorney form.  
 
The Court finds Counsel served
Plaintiff at a confirmed address and Plaintiff has not opposed the motion.  Counsel was not required to serve Defendant
with the moving papers, as Defendant has not yet appeared in the action.  The motion to be relieved is granted.  Relief is effective upon filing proof of
service of the final order on Plaintiff. 
The 3/01/24 CMC and OSC hearing remains on calendar.  
 
Counsel is ordered to give notice.
