And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendant has moved to strike the plaintiff's prayer for punitive damages and related allegations, as well as the prayer for prejudgment interest. The court has granted the motion to strike the prayer for punitive damages, finding that the failure to properly identify oneself at the scene of an accident does not constitute a tortious act that could give rise to punitive damages. The court has also granted the motion to strike the prayer for prejudgment interest, as prejudgment interest is not available in personal injury suits. The defendant is ordered to file an answer to the complaint within ten days, and any opposition to the motion was due on or before February 5, 2024.
