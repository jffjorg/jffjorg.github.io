And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering the enforceability of an arbitration clause in a contract between Fulton Books and Google. The contract is for publication and distribution, and Fulton Books has not disputed its adhesive nature. The judge notes that whether a contract is adhesive or not is irrelevant, as arbitration clauses in contracts of adhesion are not per se unenforceable. The judge also points out that the arbitration provision states that proceedings shall be heard in Crawford County, PA. The judge has tentatively ruled that Fulton Books has met the first element of CCP section 1281.2, and the case will proceed accordingly.
