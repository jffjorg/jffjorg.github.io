[2] For clarity, though
the motion indicates that the agreement is entitled a ‘Publication and
Distribution Agreement,’ the agreement is not entitled as such. That said,
introductory paragraph of the agreement indicates that it is a contract wherein
Fulton Books is “engaged in the business of providing services and products to
authors (hereinafter, “Authors”) seeking to publish, promote, and
sell their manuscripts (“Works”). Author hereby desires to utilize
Publisher as a provider of certain services (the “Services”) subject to the
below terms and conditions (the “Terms and Conditions”). (Barnhart Decl., Ex.
A, p. 5 of 11 of PDF, emphasis added.) Therefore, the agreement is one
for publication and distribution. 
 


[3] Accordingly,
Defendant has met the first element of CCP section 1281.2.  


[4] Fulton does not
dispute that the contract is adhesive. 
 


[5] Whether the contract is adhesive or
not is irrelevant because a contract of adhesion is nonetheless a valid
contract. (Reply p. 2, quoting Intershop Communications v. Superior Court
(2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 191, 201.) And arbitration clauses in contracts of
adhesion are not per se unenforceable. (Reply p. 2, citing Carnival Cruise
Lines, Inc. v. Shute (1991) 499 U.S. 585, 589 (“Carnival”); Bolter
v. Superior Ct. (2001) 87 Cal. App. 4th 900, 908; Cal–State Bus. Prods.
& Servs., Inc. v. Ricoh (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1666, 1679 (“Cal-State”).)
 


[6] The third to last
sentence of the arbitration provision in the agreement states the following:
“Arbitration proceedings shall be heard in Crawford County, PA….”
(Barnhart Decl., Ex. A, emphasis added.)
