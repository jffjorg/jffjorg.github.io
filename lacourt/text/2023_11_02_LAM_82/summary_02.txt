And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' application for a right to attach order against defendant Gena Kopytov in the amount of $419,323.20. The plaintiffs alleged that Kopytov breached Section 6.2 of WPRC's Operating Agreement by hiring the Michelman Firm without unanimous member consent. However, the judge found that the agreement's language is ambiguous and that there is no clear evidence of a breach. The judge also noted that there are two judicial rulings that are arguably inconsistent with each other and that do not completely support the plaintiffs' interpretation of the agreement. Therefore, the judge concluded that the plaintiffs cannot establish a likelihood of obtaining a judgment in their favor and denied the application.
