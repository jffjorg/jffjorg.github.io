And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is questioning whether the plaintiffs were entitled to file a reply brief in support of their application for a writ of attachment, and whether it was even possible to file a late reply brief. Additionally, the judge notes that Exhibit K to the supplemental declaration lacks page numbering and appears to only include a previous ruling by Judge Kalra, which was adopted without material changes. The judge also points out that Anatoly Krichevsky, who was seeking disqualification, was dismissed from the suit in June 2023. Finally, the judge notes that the previous ruling assumes but does not decide whether Section 6.1 of a certain agreement gives the manager authority to sue Larissa Krichevsky, but disqualifies the Michelman Firm from the entire case.
