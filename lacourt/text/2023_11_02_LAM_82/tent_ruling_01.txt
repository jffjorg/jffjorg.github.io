Real Party in Interest.
 


 




 


 


 


 



            Petitioner California Highway Patrol
petitions for a writ of mandate directing respondent California State Personnel
Board to set aside its decision imposing a one-year suspension of real party in
interest Nathaniel Partridge’s employment and instead uphold petitioner’s
penalty of dismissal from employment. 
 
I.       Factual Background
 
A.          
Partridge’s
Claims for Overtime Compensation
 
            Real party in interest Nathaniel
Partridge joined petitioner California Highway Patrol (“CHP”) as a Patrol
Officer in May 2006. (AR 932.) Patridge was assigned to the East Los Angeles
Office (“ELA”). (AR 932-33.) Partridge voluntarily worked overtime in the
Caltrans Maintenance Zone Enhanced Enforcement Program (“MAZEEP”). 
 
            In connection with an audit of
MAZEEP, Partridge was investigated and interrogated about 22 occasions where Partridge
certified time on his CHP 415 concerning when he was on MAZEEP detail. (AR 4, 1851:2-7;
2171:24-2172:10, 1371-75.) Partridge admitted that he may have gone home early
from a MAZEEP detail two or three times but had been paid for overtime hours.
(AR 1877:19-1878:19.) Partridge admitted that, on September 17, 2017 in
particular, he left the office before the stated end of the overtime detail.
(AR 1863:21-25.)
 
On
September 17, 2017, Partridge claimed 10 hours of work while the evidence showed
that he only worked six hours and 15 minutes and was at his home for the
remainder of MAZEEP detail. (AR 5.) CHP found Partridge signed and submitted a
false CHP 415 timesheet to claim an extra 3 hours and 45 minutes of overtime he
did not work, thereby fraudulently obtaining approximately $288.98 of
compensation. (AR 5.) During Partridge’s administrative interrogation, he
admitted that he “took the chance to go home and would fall on the consequence if
. . . called back.” (AR 1263:6-7.) CHP also found that Partridge further violated
policy on eight occasions by not entering the time he returned his patrol
vehicle on a required CHP 33 form. (AR 6, 1341-48.)
 
B.          
Relevant
CHP Policies and Procedures
 
Under the official CHP
policy regarding CHP 415, officers are required to “[r]ecord the start and finish
time of the actual overtime worked.” (AR 956, ¶ 5.) Officers are trained on how
to complete CHP 415s in the Academy and during break-in training. (AR 1536:1-10.)
Officers are required to fill out a CHP 415 form in order to be paid. (AR 1536:10-12.)
 
The CHP 33, or “Driver’s
Equipment Check” form, remains inside each patrol vehicle. (AR 957, 1544:2-13.)
At the end of every detail, officers are required to complete the time the
vehicle is turned in (“Time In”), along with other relevant information. (AR
957-58, 1546:19-1547:13.) This policy is taught at the Academy and during
officers’ break-in period. (AR 1547:17-20.)
 
The interagency agreement
(“Agreement”) between CHP and the California Department of Transportation for
reimbursable services for MAZEEP states that CHP officers will be paid for hours
they work on an overtime detail, and for travel time to and from the worksite,
from the ELA area office. (AR 961; 1542:9-23.)
 
Though not part of the
Agreement, the ELA office’s Standard Operating Procedures (“SOP”) on Overtime
read, in pertinent part: “Officers working overtime such as … MAZEEP details
shall remain available during the duration of the reimbursable contract. If
Caltrans ends a detail early due to unforeseen circumstances but continues to
pay the officer for the duration of the contract, the officer shall remain
available to Caltrans by standing by at the office. (AR 995.) Partridge
admitted that Sergeant Connie Guzman told him this SOP provision required he
remain at the office until the end of the scheduled detail. (AR 1947:22-1948:11,
3034:8-12.)
 
 
C.          
Procedural Administrative
History
 
CHP served Partridge with
a Notice of Adverse Action (“NOAA”) on February 7, 2020. (AR 1-2.) The action was
for dismissal, effective March 2, 2020. (AR 1.) The NOAA described that
Partridge’s conduct violated Government Code § 19572, subdivisions: (d)
inexcusable neglect of duty, (f) dishonesty, (p) misuse of state property, (r)
violation of the prohibitions set forth in accordance with Government Code §
19990, and (t) other failure of good behavior. (AR 1.)
 
On March 23, 2020,
Partridge appealed his dismissal to respondent State Personnel Board (“SPB”).
(AR 12.) An evidentiary hearing was held on July 27-30 and August 2-4, 2021.
(AR 3230.) During the hearing, Patridge testified that other sergeants and
officers were leaving before the stated end time of a MAZEEP overtime detail. (AR
3027:14-3028:10; 3029:19-3030:4.) 
 
On October 14, 2021, the
Proposed Decision by ALJ Douglas A. Purdy was served. (AR 3267.) The ALJ
sustained the charges of inexcusable neglect of duty and other failure of good
behavior only and reduced the penalty to a one-month suspension. (AR 3631,
3265.) The SPB rejected the proposed decision and requested oral argument,
which was held on February 9, 2022. (AR 3228, 3292.)
 
The SPB agreed with the
ALJ’s finding that on eight separate occasions in a six-month period, Partridge
failed to fully complete the CHP 33 following a MAZEEP detail, finding that Partridge
“routinely omitted the time when he returned the patrol vehicle to the
station.” (AR 3638, 3693.) This was found to be inexcusable neglect of duty and
other failure of good behavior. (AR 3638.)
 
Regarding the single
charged incident of falsifying time records and claiming $288.98 in fraudulent
compensation (AR 1-9), the SPB found that Partridge had violated Government
Code section 19572, subdivisions (d) inexcusable neglect of duty, (f) dishonesty, (p) misuse of state property, (r) violation
of the prohibitions set forth in accordance with Government Code § 19990, and
(t) other failure of good behavior. (AR 3640-47.)
 
In its written decision,
the SPB acknowledged the factors affecting penalty as set forth in Skelly v.
State Personnel Bd. (1975) 15 Cal.3d 194, 217-18, including the “overriding
consideration” of the extent to which the employee’s conduct resulted in, or if
repeated is likely to result in harm to the public service, the circumstances
surrounding the misconduct, and the likelihood of recurrence of misconduct. (AR
3647.) The SPB Decision explicitly notes that:
 
there are professions,
like that of law enforcement, which impose upon its servants certain
‘responsibilities and limitations on freedom of action which do not exist in
other callings.’ [Citations.]” (Anderson v. State Personnel Bd. (1987)
194 Cal.App.3d 761, 771.) Hence, peace officers are held to a higher standard
of conduct in comparison to other civil service positions. (County of Los
Angeles v. Civil Service Com. of County of Los Angeles (2019) 40
Cal.App.5th 871, 878.)
 
(AR 3647.)
 
The Decision describes
the harm to public service due to Partridge “knowingly violat[ing] written
policy to claim compensation or taxpayers’ dollars for hours that he did not
work nor was he legally entitled to claim.” (AR 3647.) The SPB found that
Partridge’s actions “could easily cause members of the public to question the
integrity of CHP officers and CHP as a whole.” (AR 3647.) The Decision acknowledges
that Partridge’s actions were, “among other things, plainly
dishonest.” (AR 3647.) The Decision
further notes that, because “peace officers are specifically held to higher
standards of conduct than civilian employees, their acts of dishonesty are
considered highly injurious to their employing agencies. (AR 3647-48.) 
 
In the Decision, the SPB
noted that Partridge had been a CHP officer since 2006 and “appears to be” a
good employee. (AR 3648.) The Decision notes that he had not suffered any prior
disciplinary actions and had received excellent or proficient performance
ratings in the prior three years. (AR 3648.) The SPB found this lengthy,
discipline-free tenure was deserving of “serious consideration,” especially in
light of the “minor transgression” of dishonestly claiming unearned overtime
and a minor transgression in his “haphazard completion of CHP forms.” (AR
3648.)
 
The SPB also noted that other
CHP officers who were dismissed for claiming unearned MAZEEP overtime
compensation “generally involved multiple and costly claims for unearned
overtime compensation indicative of a pattern of practice.” (AR 3648.) By
contrast, Partridge was charged with a “singular” occasion where he “made a
poor choice to claim three-plus hours of unearned overtime compensation.” (AR
3648-49.) The SPB concluded that the isolated charged event does “not
necessarily” suggest Partridge has a propensity or disposition to lie, cheat,
or deceive. (AR 3649.)
 
In evaluating the
“totality of the circumstances,” the SPB wrote that “while dismissals of peace
officers found to have been dishonest are generally justified, there is no
authority suggesting that dismissal is the only option.” (AR 3649, citing County
of Siskiyou v. State Personnel Bd. (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 1606, 1617.) The
Decision cites Department of Parks and Recreation v. State Personnel Bd. (1991)
233 Cal.App.3d 813, 827 for the proposition that modification of a penalty is
appropriate when the evidence establishes the cause of discipline is proven but
is insufficient to support the level of punitive action taken. (AR 3649.) The
SPB agreed that penalty modification is appropriate when the penalty is out of
proportion to the proven misconduct. (AR 3649.)
 
Ultimately, the SPB
“[did] not find there to be a tremendous likelihood of recurrence especially
considering the limited nature of Partridge’s offense, the widespread
disciplinary actions taken by CHP against officers who abuse the public trust
in failing to adhere to CHP’s policies, and the stern discipline the Board will
impose in this action.” (AR 3650.) The SPB found that, instead of dismissal, the
imposition of a one-year suspension resulting in the loss of a year’s salary
was just and proper under the circumstances. (AR 3650.)
 
II.      Procedural History
 
             On September 20, 2022, petitioner CHP filed a verified
Petition for Writ of Mandate. On October 26, 2022, real party in interest Partridge
filed a verified Answer. On November 2, 2022, respondent SPB filed a verified Answer.

 
            On
September 5, 2023, CHP filed an opening brief. On October 3, 2023, Partridge
filed an opposition. On October 18, 2023, CHP filed a reply.  The Court has received an electronic copy of
the administrative record and a hard copy of the joint appendix. 
 
III.     Standard of Review
 
“The
propriety of a penalty imposed by an administrative agency is a matter vested
in the discretion of the agency, and its decision may not be disturbed unless
there has been a manifest abuse of discretion.” (Lake v. Civil Service
Commission (1975) 47 Cal.App.3d 224, 228.) If reasonable minds can differ
with regard to the propriety of the disciplinary action, there is no abuse of
discretion. (County of Los Angeles v. Civil Service Commission (1995) 39
Cal.App.4th 620, 634.)
 
In
considering whether an abuse of discretion occurred, the “overriding
consideration … is the extent to which the employee’s conduct resulted in, or
if repeated is likely to result in, ‘[h]arm to the public service.’
[Citations.] Other relevant factors include the circumstances surrounding the
misconduct and the likelihood of its recurrence.” (Skelly v. State Personnel
Bd. (1975) 15 Cal.3d 194, 218.)
 
“[A
peace officer’s] job is a position of trust and the public has a right to the
highest standard of behavior from those they invest with the power and
authority of a law enforcement officer. Honesty, credibility and temperament
are crucial to the proper performance of an officer’s duties.” (Talmo v.
Civil Service Com. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 210, 231.)
 
IV.     Analysis
 
CHP
asserts that the SPB abused its discretion in imposing a one-year suspension on
Partridge instead of terminating him. 
 
            As a preliminary matter, Partridge
argues that CHP never enforced or complied with its overtime policies. (Opp. at
9:20-14:6.)  Seemingly attempting to
relitigate whether a violation was proven, Partridge thus argues that “CHP did
not prove by substantial evidence that Partridge was dishonest or had an intent
to deceive.” (Opp. at 14:4-5.)  Putting
aside the propriety of attempting to subvert a liability determination in an
opposition brief defending the penalty imposed, Partridge’s contention is
incorrect.  To begin with, the
“controlling precedential decision” upon which Partridge relies for his
argument—E.D. (1993) SPB Dec. No. 93-32—is inapposite.  In E.D., the SPB found that a finding
of inexcusable neglect of duty or misuse of state property with respect to
overtime required an intent by CHP to enforce the pertinent overtime policy,
but, in E.D., the CHP never established that it had a policy concerning the
practice at issue in that case. (E.D., SPB Dec. No. 93-32 at * 9.) Here,
it is undisputed that CHP policies required the accurate completion of CHP 415
and 33 forms. (AR 956-58.)  Further, it
is undisputed ELA’s SOP stated that officers working overtime such as MAZEEP should remain available to Caltrans by standing by
at the office (AR 995)—a policy Partridge admitted Sergeant Guzman communicated
to him. (AR 1947-48.)  It is also undisputed that Partridge
violated these policies.  The SPB
accordingly was entitled to find, as it did, that Partridge engaged in
dishonest conduct.
 
            Nevertheless, the Court does agree
with Partridge that the SPB did not manifestly abuse its discretion by imposing
the punishment that it did for Partridge’s dishonest conduct. While noting that
peace officers are held to a high standard of conduct, the SPB correctly noted
that each individual case must be assessed on the totality of the
circumstances. (AR 3648; Skelly, 15 Cal.3d at 218 [relevant factor in
evaluating penalty is “circumstances surrounding misconduct” and likelihood of
recurrence].)
 
            Here, compared to cases where CHP
officers were dismissed for submitting multiple, costly claims for overtime, Partridge’s
discipline is based on a single instance of claiming 3 hours and 45 minutes of
unearned overtime compensation, amounting to $288.98. (AR 3637-38, 3648-49; cf.
AR 3648, fn. 4 [listing cases where unearned overtime ranged from 2 separate
occasions totaling 8 hours to 39 occasions].) Based on the one incident, it was
within reason for SPB to find the absence of any indication that Partridge had
a propensity to cheat, deceive, or defraud. (AR 3649; see Gee v. California
State Personnel Bd. (1970) 5 Cal.App.3d 713, 718-19 [“‘Dishonesty’ connotes
a disposition to deceive. [Citation.] It “denotes an absence of integrity; a
disposition to cheat, deceive, or defraud”].) Consistent with that finding, the
SPB noted Partridge’s lack of prior disciplinary actions and excellent and
proficient ratings in his last three years of employment. (AR 3632, 3648.) 
 
The
SPB found that, under the circumstances presented, dismissal would be disproportional,
whereas a one-year suspension would be just and proper. (AR 3649-50; see Department
of Parks & Recreation v. State Personnel Bd. (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 813,
827 [modification of penalty recommended by ALJ appropriate when “cause for
discipline is proven but is insufficient to support the level of punitive
action taken”].) Such a finding is not outside the bounds of reason. (Ng v.
State Personnel Bd. (1977) 68 Cal.App.3d 600, 605 [“Discretion is abused
when the action exceeds the bound of reason”].) 
 
            CHP argues that Partridge omitted
the time when he returned the patrol vehicle to the station on eight separate
occasions in the CHP 33 forms. (AR 3638.) CHP argues that Partridge made it
difficult for CHP management to detect an early return because he left no other
fields blank. (Reply at 5:6-9; AR 1341-48.) The SPB sustained the ALJ’s finding
of inexcusable neglect of duty and other failure of good behavior based on these
eight occasions. (AR 3638.) However, with respect to dishonesty, the SPB found
that entry of the return time on the CHP 33 form is not determinative of
whether the officer would be entitled to claim full overtime compensation for
the shift. (AR 3643.) This is because the SOP allowed the officer to stay at
the station after an early release for the duration of the shift and claim full
overtime. (AR 995, 3643.) Accordingly, while Partridge failed to comply with
policy concerning the CHP 33 forms, it was not unreasonable to conclude that
Partridge’s failure to enter the time he returned patrol vehicles is not indicative
of intent to conceal his lack of entitlement to overtime or probative of his
honesty concerning claims for overtime.
 
            CHP also argues that Partridge admitted
he may have gone home early two or three times. (AR 1877:19-1878:19.) More
precisely, Partridge only stated that he “possibly” left the East LA area two
or three times. (AR 1878:1-5.) More to the point, CHP did not charge Partridge
for more than one false claim of overtime. Accordingly, Partridge’s vague
concession is not sufficient to punish Partridge for purportedly engaging in additional
acts of dishonesty beyond the one with which he was charged. 
 
“Judicial
interference with the agency’s assessment of a penalty ‘will only be sanctioned
when there is an arbitrary, capricious or patently abusive exercise of
discretion by the administrative agency.’” (Kazensky v. City of Merced
(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 44, 54.) Based on the foregoing, the Court does not find the
SPB committed a manifest abuse of discretion when imposing a penalty for
Partridge’s conduct. To be sure, Partridge’s misconduct of claiming three-plus
hours of unearned overtime compensation was serious and warrants significant discipline,
but the Court cannot say that a one-year suspension without pay is unreasonable,
considering the proportionality of the discipline to the single offense and Partridge’s
lack of prior discipline in his 16 years of employment with CHP. Even though
Partridge did not enter his return time on the CHP 33 form on eight occasions,
none of those occasions were meaningfully linked to a false claim for overtime.

 
CHP
cites cases for the proposition that courts do not tolerate peace officer
dishonesty. (OB at 17:3-13.)  That is
true, and the courts should not.  But
this Court has considered all of CHP’s cited authorities and finds they do not
support a finding that the SPB manifestly abused its discretion under the
circumstances of this case. 
 
Case
law does not support the proposition that discharge is required in all instances
in which a police officer is found guilty of dishonesty. Without question, a law
enforcement officer’s dishonesty may warrant discharge and often should. (See
Ackerman v. State Personnel Bd. (1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 395, 398-99, 400-01 [upholding
dismissal, finding discharge for theft of government property and lying twice
about it did not “exceed the bounds of reason”]; Wilson v. State Personnel
Bd. (1976) 58 Cal.3 865, 882 [upholding dismissal for false claim of
overtime, finding “[n]o employer, including the state, is to be condemned for
terminating one who has willfully defrauded his employer in such fashion”]; Haney
v. City of Los Angeles (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1, 12 [upholding dismissal,
finding that leaving duty post for barbecue and falsifying daily report to conceal
time spent at barbecue]; Flowers v. State Personnel Bd. (1985) 174
Cal.App.3d 753, 761 [upholding dismissal based on dishonesty, misuse of state
property, and insubordination]; Talmo v. Civil Service Comm. (1991) 231
Cal.App.3d 210, 229 [upholding dismissal where deputy sheriff committed battery
against prisoners and lying about it to superior officers]; Nicolini v.
County of Tuolumne (1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 619, 627-28 [upholding dismissal
where deputy sheriff altered prescription, was dishonest, and was
uncooperative]; Paulino v. Civil Service Com. (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 962,
972 [upholding dismissal where deputy sheriff falsely reported ill and made
false and misleading statements in reports about his purported sick day]; Kolender
v. San Diego County Civil Service Commission (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 716,
722 [upholding dismissal where deputy sheriff lied to protect a colleague who
had abused an inmate].) However, these cases do not counsel that termination is
the only appropriate penalty for every single act of dishonesty irrespective of
the circumstances.  To the contrary, nothing
prevents the SPB from considering mitigating circumstances in fashioning the
appropriate discipline for any particular act of dishonesty. 
 
To
be sure, one episode of dishonesty may very well be sufficient to merit
termination.  In this regard, the Court
notes that, in Cate v. State Personnel Bd. (2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 270, the
Court of Appeal found that the SPB abused its discretion when it reduced the
punishment of a correctional officer from termination to a 30-day suspension. (Cate,
204 Cal.App.4th at 287.) However, in Cate, the prison guard
encouraged a mentally ill patient to commit suicide, intimidated a witness, and
was dishonest. (Id. at 282-83, 285.) That egregious misconduct
warranting termination is not comparable to Partridge’s misconduct of falsely
claiming three-plus hours of unearned overtime. 
            
            CHP also argues that Partridge’s
dishonesty will need to be disclosed to counsel for criminal defendants under Brady
v. Maryland (1963) 373 U.S. 83. (OB at 12:22-13:14; Association for Los
Angeles Deputy Sheriffs v. Superior Court (2019) 8 Cal.5th 28, 40.)  That may be true for the rest of Partridge’s
career, but, as observed by the SPB, this particular single incident of proven
dishonesty does not necessarily suggest “a propensity or disposition to lie,
cheat, or deceive” (see AR 3649), such that Partridge might still be
found to credibly testify in the future, even when confronted with or
cross-examined about the false overtime claim. 
Thus, it was not unreasonable for the SPB to conclude Partridge’s
conduct is not likely to result in harm to the public service (see Skelly,
15 Cal.3d at 217-218), because the violation at issue does not necessarily
render him unable to offer testimony as a law enforcement officer that can be
found credible when called to do so, notwithstanding the prior violation.
 
            Based on the foregoing, the Court
finds the SPB’s reduction of discipline from the CHP’s desired outcome of
termination to a one-year suspension was not a manifest abuse of discretion. 
 
 
V.      Conclusion
 
            The
petition is DENIED. Pursuant to Local Rule
3.231(n), real party in interest Nathaniel Partridge shall prepare, serve, and ultimately file a
proposed judgment.
