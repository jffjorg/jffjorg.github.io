entitled to file a Reply Brief in support of an Application for Writ of
Attachment at all, let alone a late one. 
(Cf. CCP § 484.010(e) [providing for opposition to be
filed five court days prior to the hearing without mention of any opportunity
for Reply].


[2]           Exhibit K to the Supplemental Stone
Declaration lacks page numbering.  The
Court also notes that Exhibit K includes only Judge Kalra’s Tentative Ruling,
but there appears to be no dispute that Judge Kalra adopted his Tentative
Ruling without any material changes. 
Also, according to the Kalra Ruling, the party moving for
disqualification was Anatoly Krichevsky, but this Court notes that Anatoly Krichevsky
had been dismissed from the suit in June 2023. (See Compl.
¶¶ 10-12.)
 


[3]           In a footnote, the Kalra Ruling assumes
but does not decide that Section 6.1 may provide the manager with authority to
sue Larissa Krichevsky but nonetheless disqualifies the Michelman Firm from the
entire case.  (Supp. Stone Decl. Ex. K.)
