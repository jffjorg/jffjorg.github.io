And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the plaintiffs' motion to consolidate the eviction case with the civil case and stay the eviction proceeding. The plaintiffs, Mercedes Oroz and Gabriel Eduardo Marin, filed a complaint against the defendants, France M. Nese Trustees of Nese Family Trust and Nese Family Trust, alleging that the landlord is attempting to evict them in retaliation for their inhabitability complaints, personal injury case, and low rent due to rent control. The plaintiffs requested consolidation and a stay, citing uninhabitable conditions in the residential property, including water damage, rodent infestation, and mold. However, the court denied the request, citing L.A.S.C.L.R. 3.3(g)(1), which states that cases may not be consolidated unless they are in the same department. The court also noted that the cases were not deemed related, and therefore, the motion to consolidate was denied.
