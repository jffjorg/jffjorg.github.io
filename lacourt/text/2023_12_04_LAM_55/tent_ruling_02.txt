 Case Number:  23STCV21901    Hearing Date:   December 4, 2023    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:  Plaintiffs Mercedes
Oroz and Gabriel Eduardo Marin's Motion to Consolidate the Eviction Case With
Civil Case; Stay the Eviction Proceeding.
 
The motion is denied.
 
 
On 9/12/23,  MERCEDES
OROZ and GABRIEL EDUARDO MARIN  (“plaintiffs”)
filed a Complaint against FRANCE M. NESE TRUSTEES OF NESE FAMILY TRUST and NESE
FAMILY TRUST (“defendants”), alleging that the landlord, owners, trust, or
beneficiaries are liable for the landlord’s attempting to evict plaintiffs in
retaliation for inhabitability complaints, Plaintiff’s personal injury case,
and low rent due to rent control.
The causes of action are:  1. Breach of Rental Contract;  2. Breach of Covenant of Good Faith And Fair
Dealing;  3. Trespass;  4. Harassment;  5. Retaliation;  6. Wrongful Eviction [CA Civil Code   § 789.3(A)]; 
7. Uncured Building Violations [Code   § 1942.2]; 
8. Breach Of Warranty of Habitability [Code   § 1941]; 
9. Elder Abuse;  10. Declaratory
Relief;  and  11.  Injunction….
 
Plaintiffs request an order consolidating the Unlawful
Detainer (UD) Complaint, number 23STUD08828, with this case, and staying the UD
action pending the resolution of the civil case.
Reasons given include that the landlord is attempting
to evict elderly tenants who pay $690 monthly rent under rent control, from
residential property at 635 N. Avenue 50, Los Angeles, having uninhabitable
conditions, including water damage, rodent infestation and mold.
On 10/5/23, defendants opposed a related ex parte
application, arguing that relating and consolidating the cases would delay the
UD proceedings, the cases involve different claims, facts, parties and remedies,
and Civil Judges generally are less experienced in UD.
On 10/6/23 and again on 10/11/23, the Court denied the
request to relate the civil and UD cases.
“Cases may not be consolidated unless they are in the
same department. A motion to consolidate two or more cases may be noticed and
heard after the cases, initially filed in different departments, have been
related into a single department, or if the cases were already assigned to that
department.”  L.A.S.C.L.R.  3.3(g)(1).
Clearly, after the Court has denied relating the
cases, they are not authorized for consolidation.
If the cases had been deemed related, then the Court
would have had discretion as to whether to consolidate the UD and Civil
actions. An order determining whether to consolidate is discretionary.  Todd-Stenberg v. Dalkon Shield Claimants
Trust (1996) 48 Cal. App. 4th 976, 978. 
Conclusion
 
The motion is denied, because of the denials of
requests to deem the cases related.  L.A.S.C.L.R.  3.3(g)(1).
