And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel further responses to discovery requests filed by the plaintiff, Lauro Marcial, against General Motors LLC. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant failed to repair a 2018 Chevrolet Silverado within a reasonable number of attempts, violating the Song-Beverly Act. The defendant opposed the motion, arguing that the discovery requests were overbroad and vague, and that the plaintiff was attempting to manufacture a discovery dispute without meeting and conferring in good faith. The judge sustained the defendant's objections to the discovery requests and denied the motion to compel further responses. The judge also denied the plaintiff's request for sanctions in the amount of $2,004.15. The parties are ordered to schedule an informal discovery conference with the court for any future discovery disputes.
