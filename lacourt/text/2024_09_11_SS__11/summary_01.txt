Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the petition for coordination of two overlapping representative actions brought under the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) for alleged violations of Wage Order 7-2001's suitable-seating requirements. The actions, Meda v. Autozone, Inc. and Gonzalez v. Autozoners, LLC, were deemed complex by the Los Angeles and Santa Clara Superior Courts, respectively. The judge has granted the petition for coordination, recommending the Los Angeles Superior Court as the site for the coordination proceedings and the Second District Court of Appeal as the reviewing appellate court. The judge has also granted the stay request, staying the included actions pending coordination. The judge's decision is based on the following factors: the complexity of the cases, the predominance of common questions, the convenience of the parties, witnesses, and counsel, the efficient use of judicial resources and manpower, the calendars of the courts, the risk of duplicative and inconsistent rulings, and the likelihood of settlement in the absence of coordination.
