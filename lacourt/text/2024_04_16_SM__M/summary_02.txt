And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the petition to approve the compromise of the disputed claim of a minor. The judge finds that the settlement is reasonable and approves the distribution of the settlement proceeds. The judge excuses the personal appearance of the claimant and the guardian ad litem, allowing counsel to appear by telephone or video conference call. The judge sets an OSC (order to show cause) for the purchase of an annuity on a future date and orders the moving party to give notice.
