Here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to set aside and vacate the default/default judgment is DENIED. The Defendant, DBO Investments SA, LLC, moves to set aside the default/default judgment, citing grounds such as lack of actual notice and void judgment. However, the Court lacks jurisdiction to vacate the judgment because the motion was filed more than six months after the judgment was entered. Additionally, the Defendant did not demonstrate any grounds for relief and did not diligently seek to set aside the default/default judgment. The Court concludes that the motion is DENIED.
