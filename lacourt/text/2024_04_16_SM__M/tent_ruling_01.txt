Legal
Standard
 
Relief under section 473(b) is either discretionary
or mandatory. A motion for mandatory relief must be made no more than six
months after entry of judgment and be accompanied by an attorney’s sworn
affidavit attesting to the attorney’s “mistake, inadvertence, surprise or
neglect.” (CCP § 473(b).) The attorney affidavit of fault must contain a
“straight forward admission of fault.” (State Farm Fire & Casualty Co.
v. Pietak (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 600, 610.) But it need not contain an
explanation of the reasons for the attorney’s mistake, inadvertence surprise or
neglect. (Martin Potts &
Assocs., Inc. v. Corsair, LLC (2016)
244 Cal.App.4th 432, 438-441.)
Relief must be
granted “unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact
caused by the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.” (Ibid.) If mandatory relief is
granted, the court must “direct
the attorney to pay reasonable compensatory legal fees and costs” to the
opposing counsel or parties. (CCP § 473(b).)
 
Where a party cannot obtain an attorney affidavit of
fault, the party may seek discretionary relief under section 473(b) due to “mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” (CCP § 473(b).) A motion for
discretionary relief must be made “within a reasonable time but in no instance
exceeding six months after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was
taken.” (Id.) If discretionary relief is granted, the court may in its
discretion order the moving party to pay the costs, including attorney fees,
incurred in obtaining the default. (Rogalski v. Nabers Cadillac (1992)
11 Cal.App.4th 816, 823; Vanderkous v. Conley (2010) 188
Cal.App.4th 111, 118-119.) If the motion for discretionary relief is granted, the
court may order the offending attorney to pay monetary sanctions up to $1,000
to opposing parties, or up to $1,000 to the State Bar Client Security Fund, or
“[g]rant other relief as is appropriate.” (CCP § 473(c)(1)(A), (B), (C).)
 
A motion for relief under section 473(b) “shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed
therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted. . .” (CCP § 473(b).)
However, this requirement is
not jurisdictional; substantial compliance may suffice. (Carmel, Ltd. v. Tavoussi (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 393, 403
[finding substantial compliance where counsel offered proposed answer at
motion hearing rather than serving it with moving papers].) 
 
Analysis
 
Defendant DBO Investments SA, LLC,
moves to set aside and vacate default/default judgment. As set forth below, Defendant
does not demonstrate any grounds for relief and the motion is DENIED.
 
Here, the Court lacks jurisdiction
to vacate the judgment. The statute provides a six-month time limit from the
date of judgment to bring such a motion. On February 24, 2023, the Court entered
default judgment against Defendant. On July 25, 2023, Defendant filed a notice
of motion on the grounds that “service of the Summons did not result in actual
notice (CCP §473.5); the judgment and/or default is void (CCP §473(d)); and
other arguments.” In that notice, Defendant did not raise the discretionary or
mandatory provisions for relief under CCP section 473(b). The notice was
not “accompanied by an
attorney’s sworn affidavit” as required for mandatory relief. On October 31,
2023, which is more than six months after the judgment, over a year
after Defendant had actual notice of this suit and default was entered,
Defendant filed and served this motion and declaration asserting
attorney-mistake for the first time. Thus, the application for relief was not
filed within six months of the entry of judgment. Moreover, the declarations
are not verified per Code of Civil Procedure section 2015.5 (neither declarant
states the date or place of execution) and the attorney affidavit of fault is
unsigned. Therefore, the court lacks jurisdiction to vacate default or default
judgment on the mandatory or discretionary grounds of section 473(b).
 
Defendant asserts that default
judgment is void and/or may be vacated because Defendant did not have actual
knowledge of this action. (CCP §§ 473(d), 437.5.) However, Defendant admits
that it had actual notice of this action on October 18, 2022. (Harrison Decl.,
¶ 2; Gardea Decl., ¶ 3.) Defendant also does not explain on what grounds the
judgment is void. 
 
Defendant lastly asserts equitable
grounds. However, the record demonstrates that Defendant did not diligently
seek to set aside default or default judgment. Defendant was aware of this
action and its default in October 2022. Defendant admits that it did nothing to
correct this until, at the earliest, July 2023. The Court cannot consider this nine-month
delay to be diligent. 
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
