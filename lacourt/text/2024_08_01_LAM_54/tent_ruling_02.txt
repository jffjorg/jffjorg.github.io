BACKGROUND
            
On
March 1, 2024, Plaintiff Deying Chen sued Defendants Cetera Investment
Services, LLC; Leo Li-Yuan Chien; and Ka Anson Cheong alleging causes of action
for: (1) Fraud, (2) Breach of Fiduciary Duty, (3) Breach of Contract, (4)
Negligence, (5) Conversion, and (6) Unjust Enrichment. The action arises from alleged
fraud pertaining to money Plaintiff invested in an investment fund.
 
On July
17, 2024, while the instant motion to compel arbitration was pending, Plaintiff
filed the operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) against Defendants alleging
causes of action for: (1) Fraud, (2) Breach of Fiduciary Duty, (3) Breach of
Contract, (4) Negligence, (5) Conversion, (6) Unjust Enrichment, and (7)
Financial Elder Abuse. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
Parties may be compelled to arbitrate a
dispute upon the court finding that: (1) there was a valid agreement to
arbitrate between the parties; and (2) said agreement covers the controversy or
controversies in the parties’ dispute.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
1281.2.) California law favors enforcement of valid arbitration
agreements. (Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc. (2000)
24 Cal.4th 83, 97.) A party petitioning to compel arbitration has the burden of
establishing the existence of a valid agreement to arbitrate and the party
opposing the petition has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the
evidence, any fact necessary to its defense. (Banner Entertainment, Inc. v.
Superior Court¿(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 348, 356-357.) 
 
            Plaintiff argues that the filing
of the FAC moots Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration. Plaintiff contends
that “[t]he instant [m]otion is moot because Plaintiff has filed a First
Amended Complaint alleging an additional cause of action . . . for financial
elder abuse pursuant to Welfare & Institutions Code Section 15610.30 . . .
and stating other allegations which vitiate Defendants’ position.” (Opp’n at p.
1:24-26.) 
 
            “A
party may amend its pleading once without leave of the court at any time before
the answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is filed . . . ." (Code Civ.
Proc., § 472, subd. (a).) “Because there is but one complaint in a civil action
. . . the filing of an amended complaint moots a motion directed at a prior
complaint.” (State Compensation Ins. Fund v. Superior Court (2010) 184
Cal.App.4th 1124, 1131, citation omitted.) 
Once an amended complaint is
filed, a court cannot grant a motion directed at the prior complaint. (Ibid.)

 
The pending motion to compel
arbitration is directed at Plaintiff’s initial complaint and seeks to compel
arbitration of the claims asserted in it. The FAC raises new claims and asserts
new facts not alleged in the initial complaint. Defendants have not yet responded
to the FAC. As discussed in State Compensation Ins. Fund, supra,
184 Cal.App.4th 1124, 1131, the Court cannot rule on a motion directed at a
pleading that is no longer operative.
