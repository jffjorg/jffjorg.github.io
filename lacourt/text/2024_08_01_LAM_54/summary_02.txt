And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has denied the motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings without prejudice as it is moot due to the filing of the First Amended Complaint. The motion is directed at the initial complaint, which is no longer operative. The Judge has noted that the parties dispute whether the filing of the First Amended Complaint moots the motion, but has concluded that the motion is indeed moot. The Judge has also noted that the parties may amend their pleadings once without leave of the court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion to strike is filed, and that once an amended complaint is filed, a court cannot grant a motion directed at the prior complaint.
