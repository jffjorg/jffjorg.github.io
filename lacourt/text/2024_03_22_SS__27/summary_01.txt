The court has denied the defendant's motion to terminate sanctions, as the plaintiff has substantially complied with the court's orders for sanctions and production of further discovery responses. The court has granted the defendant's motion for monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,579, which the defendant claims has not been fully paid. The parties are ordered to meet and confer about the outstanding sanctions within 20 days, and if an agreement is not reached, the defendant is authorized to file an ex parte application. The court has also granted the defendant's request for attorney's fees in the amount of $2,310.00.
