And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has reviewed the petition to approve the compromise of pending action of Edwin Recinos, Jr., 17, and denied the application due to several deficiencies. The deficiencies include incomplete Item 11(b)(2), lack of attachment of Attachment 11b(2) and 11b(6), and a discrepancy between Items 13(a) and 14(b)(2) regarding attorney's fees. The court orders the claimant to correct these deficiencies no less than 5 days prior to the new court date set for April ____, 2024. Failure to do so may result in sanctions. The court also sets an OSC re: Minor Compromise on the same date and continues the Status Conference re: Review of Good Faith Settlement to the same date.
