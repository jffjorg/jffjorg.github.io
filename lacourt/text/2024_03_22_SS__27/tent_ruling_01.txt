RULING: 
 
Defendant’s Motion For Terminating
Sanctions is DENIED.
 
Defendant’s Motion For Monetary
Sanctions is GRANTED.
 
 
Background 
 
On March 11, 2024, the Court heard Defendant’s motion for
terminating sanctions. The Court continued the hearing to March 22, 2024, and
ordered Plaintiff to file a declaration concerning counsel's health condition
and unpaid sanctions. Plaintiff filed two declarations demonstrating that the
Court ordered discovery responses were provided and the outstanding sanctions
were paid. Plaintiff’s counsel also declare that he is healthy enough to
continue with litigating the case. Defendant contends that not all sanctions
were paid.
 
Legal Standard 
 
Terminating sanctions are
appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court's orders. (Deyo v.
Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 795-796.)  A terminating sanction
is a "drastic measure which should be employed with caution." (Deyo,
84 Cal.App.3d at 793.) "A decision to order terminating sanctions should
not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful, preceded by a history of
abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe sanctions would not produce
compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court is justified in imposing
the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005)
128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279-280.) While the court has discretion to impose
terminating sanctions, these sanctions "should be appropriate to the
dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery." (Deyo, 84
Cal.App.3d at 793.) "[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate sanction
against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with his
discovery obligations." (Ibid.) Discovery sanctions are not to be
imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of
discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information. (See
Midwife v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 57, 64 [superseded on other
grounds as stated in Kohan v. Cohan (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 967,
971].)  
 
Analysis 
 
In the original motion, Defendant outlined a list of discovery
violations, including the Court's orders for sanctions and demands for further
responses. Specifically:
 
·       
The
Court's September 30, 2022, order imposed a sanction of $810.
·       
The
Court's September 5, 2023, order required a payment of $960.
·       
The
Court's December 18, 2023, order mandated further responses to Form
Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of
Documents, along with a sanction of $3,000 that had not yet been paid.
 
On March 8, 2024, Plaintiff served the further responses as per the
Court's December 18, 2023, order and mailed a check to Defendant for $3,960.
Plaintiff’s counsel also declared that his test for cancer came out negative
and he is now ready and able to work on the case. Plaintiff has substantially
complied with court’s order for sanctions and production of further discovery
responses, and thus less severe sanctions would
produce compliance with the Court’s order. Thus, Defendant’s motion for
terminating sanctions is DENIED.
 
Defendant contends that Plaintiff has yet to remit $3,579 in
court-ordered monetary sanctions, despite Plaintiff's payment of $3,960.
However, Defendant failed to provide the Court with a detailed accounting of
how this figure was calculated. Consequently, the parties are ORDERED to
further meet and confer about the amount of outstanding sanctions amount within
20 days of today's date.  If the parties
cannot reach an agreement, Defendant is authorized to file an ex parte
application to bring the issue before the Court again.
 
Defendant was also forced to incur attorney’s fees in bringing the
present motion. Defendant requests $2,310.00 in attorney's fees. The Court grants
that request.  Plaintiff and Plaintiff’s
counsel, jointly and severally, are ordered to pay sanctions to Defendant in
the amount of $2310 within 30 days from today.
