And here is the summary in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to be relieved as counsel by Defendant's counsel, Jacqueline Bouche, is GRANTED. The reason for the motion is that there has been an irremediable breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and/or communication, which has rendered it unreasonably difficult for Plaintiff's counsel to continue representing the Plaintiff. The Judge notes that the next hearing is set for May 6, 2024, and that Defendant is already represented by another counsel, so there will be no prejudice to the Defendant by the withdrawal of the current counsel. The Judge also notes that the required forms have been filed and properly served, and that the motion is proper grounds for withdrawal under California law.
