And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Lee S. Arian, has issued a tentative ruling denying the Plaintiff's motion for leave to conduct financial discovery on the Defendants, Clayton Damian Fischer and Southwark Metal Manufacturing. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants are liable for punitive damages due to Fischer's drunk driving and Southwark's alleged failure to enforce safety protocols. However, the Judge finds that the evidence presented does not demonstrate with substantial certainty that the Defendants were aware of Fischer's drunk driving, and therefore, the Plaintiff has failed to meet the burden of showing a substantial likelihood that they can provide clear and convincing evidence of the Defendants' malice.
