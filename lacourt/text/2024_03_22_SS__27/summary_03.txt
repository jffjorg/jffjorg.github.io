This is a tentative ruling by Judge Hon. Lee S. Arian on the application of good faith settlement by Defendant DeWine Ross. The plaintiff, DeWine Ross, settled with DeWine Ross for $15,000, but the defendant Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Richard Walker contest the application, arguing that the amount is grossly disproportionate to the tortfeasor's liability share. The Court cannot determine if the settlement is indeed grossly disproportionate without an approximation of Plaintiff's total recovery and the settlor's proportionate liability, as required by CCP section 877.6(a)(1). Therefore, the motion is DENIED without prejudice.
