And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to enforce a settlement agreement reached on January 28, 2022. The agreement was to dispose of a subject property and apportion the proceeds from its sale, and the court entered a dismissal of the action and retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement. The plaintiffs argue that the defendant's successor-in-interest has not complied with the settlement, but do not specify how the estate has breached the agreement. The judge finds that the plaintiffs have not demonstrated a basis for an order enforcing the settlement and therefore denies their motion.
