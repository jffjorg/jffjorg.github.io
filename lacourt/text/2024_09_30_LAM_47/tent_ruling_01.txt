CASE
HISTORY:
·        
07/30/19: Complaint filed. 
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This was an action for partition of real property and dissolution of
partnership. On January 28, 2022, the parties reached a settlement and
dismissed the action, with the Court retaining jurisdiction to enforce the
settlement. 
 
Plaintiffs move to enforce the
settlement agreement. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Enforce
Settlement is DENIED. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
Plaintiffs move to enforce the
settlement agreement. 
 
Legal Standard
 
            Enforcement
of settlement agreements is governed by Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6.
This statute provides, in relevant part:
 
If the
parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties
outside the presence of the court or orally before the court, for settlement of
the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant
to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may
retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until
performance in full of the terms of the settlement. 
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 664.6(a).) The
Court is empowered under this section to resolve reasonable disputes over the
terms of a settlement. (Machado v. Myers (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 779,
795.) The Court does not insert provisions into the parties’ agreement, but
applies the rules of contractual interpretation to interpretation of the
settlement. (Id. at 792.) When extrinsic evidence is necessary, the
Court may decide the motion on declarations alone. (Richardson v. Richardson
(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 91, 97.) 
 
Analysis
 
            On
January 28, 2022, the parties entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual
Release of Claims to dispose of the subject property and apportion the proceeds
from sale, thereby resolving the disputes asserted in the Complaint. (See
Plaintiffs’ Exh. A.) The Court entered dismissal of the Complaint pursuant to
that agreement and retained jurisdiction by agreement of the parties pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. (See January 28, 2022 Minute Order.) 
 
            Counsel
for Plaintiffs states that although the subject property was listed for sale,
the property has not yet been sold. (Declaration of Frank A. Sanzo ISO Mot.
lines 10-11.) Defendant Renteria passed away on October 5, 2022, and his spouse
was appointed administrator of the estate. (Id. lines 11:13.) Plaintiffs
appear to argue that Defendant’s successor-in-interest has not complied with
the Settlement, but do not specify how estate has breached the agreement. The
Court therefore finds that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a basis for an
order enforcing the settlement. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ Motion to Enforce Settlement is DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
