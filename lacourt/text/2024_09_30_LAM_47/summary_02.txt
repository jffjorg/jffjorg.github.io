Significant Statements: "In general, an attorney may withdraw with or without cause so long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice to the client's interest... The court has discretion to deny an attorney's request to withdraw where the withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in the proceeding... In light of the low risk of prejudice to the parties at this juncture, the Court finds that Moving Counsel has demonstrated good cause for withdrawal."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Attorney Dev Das to be relieved as counsel for both Memory Buss and MJ Company, LLC. The motion is granted because the risk of prejudice to the parties is low, and the attorney-client relationship has irreparably broken down due to unpaid attorney's fees. The judge sets an order to show cause re: retention of substitute counsel for MJ Company, LLC. on October 30, 2024, and continues the case management conference to the same date and time. The ruling is conditioned on moving counsel submitting updated proposed orders and filing proof of service with the court.
