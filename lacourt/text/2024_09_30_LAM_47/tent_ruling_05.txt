disbursed to Plaintiff Jenna King. 
 
DISCUSSION:
 
BASTA, Inc., former counsel for
Plaintiff Jenna King, moves for an award of attorney’s fees from interpled
funds in the amount of $35,970.
 
BASTA’s Evidentiary Objections
 
            BASTA
asserts evidentiary objections to the Declaration of Thomas F. Mortimer in
support of Plaintiff’s opposition to this motion. The Court rules on these
objections as follows:
 
Objection No. 1: SUSTAINED
for lack of personal knowledge. (Evid. Code § 702(a).)
 
Objection No. 2: SUSTAINED
for lack of personal knowledge. (Evid. Code § 702(a).)
 
Objection No. 3: SUSTAINED
as an improper legal conclusion. (Hayman v. Block (1986) 176 Cal.App.3d
629, 638-39.) 
 
Plaintiff’s Untimely Opposition
 
            Plaintiff
filed and served her opposition to this motion on Friday, September 20, 2024.
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1005(b), Plaintiff’s opposition was
due on September 17, 2024, nine court days before the scheduled September 30,
2024 hearing date. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1005(b).) Plaintiff offers no explanation
for her late opposition, and the Court would be within its authority to
disregard her untimely filing. However, as BASTA has prepared a reply brief and
does not appear to have been prejudiced by the delay, the Court will consider
the merits of Plaintiff’s opposition in ruling on this motion. 
 
Procedural History
 
            This case
began as an action for fraud and breach of lease filed by Plaintiff Jenna King
and nine other individuals, alleging that Plaintiffs entered into commercial
leases with the Defendants under the belief that they were renting for
residential use. (Complaint ¶¶ 14-16.) Plaintiffs contended that Defendants
misrepresented the status of the units as residential when they were permitted
for commercial use only. (Id. ¶¶ 17-18.) At the time, all Plaintiffs,
including Ms. King, were represented by BASTA, Inc. 
 
            On July 1,
2019, the parties, including Ms. King, executed a short form settlement
agreement, in which Defendants agreed, as relevant here, to pay Plaintiffs, as
a group, $1 million in exchange for a full release of claims and settlement of
the case. (Declaration of Thomas F. Mortimer ISO Opp. Exh. C.) After Plaintiff
King signed the short form settlement agreement, a dispute arose between her
and BASTA regarding the allocation of the settlement funds, which led to BASTA
requesting to be relieved as counsel (November 12, 2019 Minute Order) and
Plaintiff challenging the settlement agreement. The Court granted Defendants’
Motion to Enforce the Settlement and thereafter entered judgment on the
settlement. (February 19, 2020 Minute Order; July 20, 2020 Judgment.) The
judgment was affirmed on appeal, and Defendants were awarded costs on appeal.
(February 23, 2022 Remittitur.) 
 
            In 2023,
Defendants in this action filed an unlawful detainer action against Plaintiff
King, entitled Downtown Prime, LLC v. King, LASC Case No. 23STUD04483,
which settled for a stipulated judgment for possession of the property, in
exchange for the owners releasing $20,000 to Plaintiff King from her
agreed-upon share of the settlement proceeds of $119,000 in this case, and
waiving the Court’s award of attorney’s fees and costs. (Declaration of Thomas
F. Mortimer ISO Mot. Enforce Settlement Exh. A.) BASTA, as Plaintiff’s former
counsel, is asserting a lien against her recovery on the remaining $99,000 in
settlement funds for the reasonable value of services rendered and unpaid costs
advanced on her behalf during the representation. (Id. Exh. B.) On May
31, 2024, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to interplead the remaining
$99,000 in settlement funds pending determination of the validity and amount of
the lien asserted by BASTA. (May 31, 2024 Minute Order.) BASTA now moves for an
award of attorney’s fees for services rendered.
 
Entitlement to Fees
 
            BASTA
contends that it is entitled to an award of attorney’s fees as a lien on Plaintiff’s
recovery from settlement. 
 
            “A lien in
favor of an attorney upon the proceeds of a prospective judgment in favor of
his client for legal services rendered has been recognized in numerous cases.
Such a lien may be created either by express contract […] or it may be implied
if the retainer agreement between the lawyer and client indicates that the
former is to look to the judgment for payment of his fee. [citations].” (Cetenko
v. United California Bank (1982) 30 Cal.3d 528, 531.) “The attorney's lien
survives even after discharge, although the attorney's recovery is limited to
the reasonable value of services actually performed (i.e., quantum meruit),
rather than the full percentage specified in the contract.” (Southern
California Gas Co. v. Flannery (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 476, 494.) When such a
discharge occurs “on the courthouse steps,” i.e., “where the client executes a
settlement obtained after much work by the attorney,” the attorney is entitled
to the full contingency to which they bargained as the reasonable value of the
services rendered.” (Fracasse v. Brent (1972) 6 Cal.3d 784, 791.) In
such circumstances, the right to fees is assessed under the terms of the
contract. (Franklin v. Appel (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 875, 894, superseded
by statute on other grounds as stated in Arnall v. Superior Court (2010)
190 Cal.App.4th 360.) However, when an attorney voluntarily withdraws from
representation, rather than being discharged, recovery in quantum meruit is
only permissible when the attorney has justifiable cause for withdrawal. (Hensel
v. Cohen (1994) 155 Cal.App.3d 563; 567; In re Estate of Falco (1987)
188 Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014; cf Pearlmutter v. Alexander (1979) 97
Cal.App.3d Supp. 16, 20.) 
            BASTA
contends that Plaintiff executed a retainer agreement on or about August 25,
2017 which provides that BASTA is entitled to 33% of any gross recovery after
the first $10,000, or, in the event of BASTA’s justifiable withdrawal from
representation, a “reasonable fee” for the legal services provided.
(Declaration of Eric M. Post ISO Mot. ¶ 8a-b.) Such a fee is to be determined
by considering:
 
(i) the amount of
the fee in proportion to the value of the service performed; (ii) the relative
sophistication of the BASTA and the Client; (iii) the novelty and difficulty of
the questions involved and the skill requisite to perform the legal service
properly; (iv) the likelihood, if apparent to the Client, that the acceptance
of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the BASTA; (v)
the amount involved and the results obtained; (vi) the time limitations imposed
by the Client or by the circumstances; (vii) the nature and length of the professional
relationship with the Client; (viii) the experience, reputation, ability of the
BASTA; (ix) the time and labor required; and (x) informed consent of the Client
to the fee.
 
(Post Decl. ¶ 8b.) Plaintiff does not dispute that she
signed the retainer agreement, nor does she dispute BASTA’s recitation of its
terms. Instead, Plaintiff argues that BASTA is not entitled to recover
attorney’s fees because its withdrawal from representation of Plaintiff was not
justified. BASTA contends that withdrawal was justified, and, in fact, was
mandated by the Rules of Professional Conduct. As set forth in Estate of
Falco, an attorney who voluntarily withdraws on ethical grounds may recover
attorney’s fees in quantum meruit, contingent on the attorney carrying the
burden of proof to demonstrate: (1) counsel's withdrawal was mandatory, not
merely permissive, under statute or State Bar rules; (2) the overwhelming and
primary motivation for counsel's withdrawal was the obligation to adhere to
these ethical imperatives under statute or State Bar rules; (3) counsel
commenced the action in good faith; (4) subsequent to counsel's withdrawal, the
client obtained recovery; and (5) counsel has demonstrated that his work
contributed in some measurable degree towards the client's ultimate recovery.”
(In Re Estate of Falco, supra, 188 Cal.App.3d at 1016.) 
 
            BASTA
argues that withdrawal was mandatory under Rule of Professional Conduct 1.16(a).
This rule mandates withdrawal where the attorney knows that the client is
asserting a position in litigation “without probable cause and for the purpose
of harassing” and when the lawyer knows that the representation will result in
violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct or the State Bar Act. (Cal.
Rules Prof. Conduct Rule 1.16(a).) According to BASTA, Plaintiff asserted such
a position by contending that she did not sign an agreement which her then-counsel
personally witnessed her signing, and it was this position which necessitated withdrawal.
Indeed, as found by this Court and affirmed on appeal, it is a settled fact
that Plaintiff signed the short form Settlement Agreement and assented to the
Settlement. (February 16, 2020 Minute Order, February 23, 2022 Remittitur.) It
is also apparent from the record that this action was vigorously litigated
before a settlement was reached, with challenges to pleadings and discovery
motion practice which were handled by BASTA before its withdrawal as
Plaintiff’s counsel. (See, e.g., July 2, 2018 Ruling on Motion for Protective
Order; September 11, 2018 Ruling on Motion to Compel Inspection.) The record
therefore strongly suggests that BASTA undertook this action in good faith. Further,
it is undisputed that Plaintiff obtained recovery after the withdrawal, and
that this recovery was obtained as a direct result of the settlement secured by
BASTA before withdrawal. 
 
            In
opposition, Plaintiff contends that BASTA’s withdrawal was not justifiable
because BASTA merely withdrew because of Plaintiff’s refusal to settle and her
contention that the settlement agreement was not valid. Both contentions have
been extensively litigated and conclusively determined against Plaintiff.
(February 16, 2020 Minute Order, February 23, 2022 Remittitur.) Plaintiff
offers no new evidence in support of that position, instead presenting the same
2019 Declaration on which the prior rulings were based. Under the doctrine of
“law of the case,” presentation of the same evidence warrants an identical conclusion.
(People v. Burbine (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 1250, 1261.) 
 
            BASTA has
demonstrated to the Court’s satisfaction that it justifiably withdrew from
representation of Plaintiff King and is therefore entitled to the reasonable
value of services rendered up to the point of withdrawal pursuant to the
attorney’s lien.
 
Reasonableness of Fees
 
            BASTA seeks
an award of attorney’s fees in the amount of $35,970.
 
            Reasonable attorney’s fees are allowable costs when
authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc § 1033.5(a)(10),
(c)(5)(B).) In actions that are based on a contract, “where the contract
specifically provides that attorney’s fees and costs, which are incurred to
enforce that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the
prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing
on the contract… shall be entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to
other costs.” (Civil Code § 1717(a) [emphasis added].) A recovery of attorney’s
fees is authorized even in noncontractual or tort actions if the contractual
provision for fee recovery is worded broadly enough. (See Code Civ. Proc §
10211; Maynard v. BTI Group, Inc. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 984, 993
[agreement to award fees based on outcome of “any dispute” encompasses all
claims, “whether in contract, tort or otherwise]; Lockton v. O'Rourke (2010)
184 Cal.App.4th 1051, 1076; Lerner v. Ward (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 155,
160.) 
Reasonable attorney’s fees shall be fixed by the Court and
shall be an element of the costs of suit. (Code Civ. Proc. § 1033.5(c)(5)(B).)
Reasonable attorney’s fees are ordinarily determined by the Court pursuant to
the “lodestar” method, i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied
by the reasonable hourly rate. (See PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095-1096; Margolin v. Regional Planning Com. (1982)
134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004 [“California courts have consistently held that a computation
of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to
a determination of an appropriate attorneys' fee award.”].) “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for
comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court
based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty
of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”  (Ibid.)
In setting the hourly rate for a fee award, courts are entitled to consider the
“fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in the community for
similar work.” (Bihun v. AT&T Info. Sys., Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th
976, 997 [affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin
v. Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 664.)  The burden
is on the party seeking attorney’s fees to prove the reasonableness of the
fees. (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino
(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 615.) 
The Court has
broad discretion in determining the amount of a reasonable attorney’s fee
award, which will not be overturned absent a “manifest abuse of discretion, a
prejudicial error of law, or necessary findings not supported by substantial
evidence.” (Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th
1379, 1393-1394.)  The Court need not explain its calculation of the
amount of attorney’s fees awarded in detail; identifying the factors considered
in arriving at the amount will suffice. (Ventura v. ABM Indus. Inc.
(2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-275.)
Here, Attorney
Post has provided an itemized list of billing entries, reproduced from his
contemporaneous billing records, describing the work performed on matters
directly related to Plaintiff King’s claims. (Post Decl. ¶ 9.) The included
list is not a direct copy of the billing records, but rather is a “synthesis”
of those entries. (Id.) Attorney Post states that he has excluded (a) client
meetings not involving Plaintiff aside from those which directly benefited her;
(b) work with law enforcement agencies; (c) trial and appellate work for
co-plaintiffs; (d) work related to Plaintiff King’s unlawful detainer; and (e)
work relating to Plaintiff’s refusal to abide by the settlement and the
subsequent dispute. (Id. ¶ 6.) Attorney Post also contends that he has
excluded time which he considers “unproductive,” “conducting administrative
tasks,” and “travel time.” (Id. ¶ 10.) After applying these exclusions,
Attorney Post contends that he alone spent 160.5 hours of attorney time between
first commencing work on the case in January 2018 and BASTA’s withdrawal from
representation on November 12, 2019. (Post Decl. ¶ 9.) Attorney Post testifies
to his skills, training, and experience, and states he is regularly awarded fees
at rates ranging between $550 and $650 for his work at the trial level. (Id.
¶¶ 11-18.) 
In opposition,
Plaintiff contends that BASTA’s claimed fees are unreasonably inflated, because
both the hourly rate and the number of hours claimed by BASTA are excessive. The
Court finds this argument lacking in force because the total fee award sought
is considerably reduced from the value of the hours and hourly rate claimed by
Attorney Post. For example, based upon the number of hours claimed by Attorney
Post, the fee award would reflect an hourly rate of $224.11. Attorney Post’s
hourly rate is more than twice that number. Moreover, at the claimed hourly
rate of $550, Attorney Post’s actual 160.5 hours would generate $88,275.00 in
fees, again more than twice the total award sought here. The Court is not
inclined to order further reduction of fees where the evidence presented
indicates that the claimant has already sharply reduced its fee request. 
            The Court
therefore finds that BASTA, Inc. has demonstrated its entitlement to recover
attorney’s fees and has demonstrated that the fees sought are reasonable. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
Accordingly, BASTA, Inc.’s Motion for
Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED. 
 
BASTA, Inc. is awarded attorney’s
fees in the amount of $35,970, to be disbursed from the interpled funds
currently deposited with the Court. 
 
The balance of the funds is to be
disbursed to Plaintiff Jenna King.
