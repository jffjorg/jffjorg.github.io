RESPONDING PARTY(S): No response on
eCourt as of 09/24/24
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a civil rights action that was filed on December 13, 2023. Plaintiff
alleges that Defendants are attempting to evict him from his rental unit under
color of a judgment in an unlawful detainer action which Plaintiff contends is
invalid. 
 
            Defendant
6230 Yucca Urban Housing, LLC demurs to the Complaint and moves to strike
portions of the Complaint. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Defendant
6230 Yucca Urban Housing, LLC’s Demurrer to the Complaint is
OVERRULED.
 
            Defendant’s Motion to Strike is DENIED.

 
DISCUSSION:
 
Demurrer to Complaint
 
            Defendant
6230 Yucca Urban Housing, LLC demurs to the Complaint.
 
            According
to the Proof of Service of Summons and Complaint filed on January 25, 2024, Plaintiff
served Defendant 6230 Yucca Urban Housing, LLC by personal service on December
13, 2023. (Proof of Service of Summons ¶ 5.) Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 430.40(a), Defendant had 30 days from that date to demur to
the Complaint, which would place the deadline on Friday, January 12, 2024.
(Code Civ. Proc. § 430.40(a).) Although no default was taken, Defendant did not
file and serve this demurrer until April 17, 2024, more than three months after
the statutory deadline. (See Demurrer Proof of Service.) Further, while
Defendant asserts that service of process was not properly made, (see
Declaration of Steven Bolanos ISO Demurrer ¶ 4), no challenge to service has
been presented which would undermine the Proof of Service of Summons. Therefore,
on this record, Defendant’s demurrer is untimely. The Court has discretion to enlarge
the time for demurrer so long as doing so “does not affect the substantial rights
of the parties.” (Code Civ. Proc. § 473(a)(1); McAllister v. County of
Monterey (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 253, 282.) Here, however, Defendant has
offered no justification for the Court to exercise that discretion, as no
explanation has been provided for the significant delay in bringing this challenge
to the pleadings. The Court therefore declines to consider Defendant’s untimely
demurrer for lack of good cause shown for the delay in its presentation.
 
            Accordingly,
Defendant’s Demurrer to the Complaint is OVERRULED.
 
Motion to Strike
 
            Defendant
6230 Yucca Urban Housing, LLC also moves to strike portions of the Complaint. A
motion to strike a Complaint or portions thereof must be made within the time
allowed to answer the Complaint, i.e., 30 days. (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 412.20(a)(1);
435(b)(1).) This motion was served and filed alongside the Demurrer to the
Complaint. Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, Defendant’s Motion to
Strike is DENIED. 
 
CONCLUSION:

 
            Accordingly,
Defendant 6230 Yucca Urban Housing, LLC’s Demurrer to the
Complaint is OVERRULED.
 
            Defendant’s Motion to Strike is
DENIED. 
 
            Moving
Party to give notice.
 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
