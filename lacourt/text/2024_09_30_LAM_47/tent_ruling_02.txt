MOTION
TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL (x2) 

 
MOVING PARTY:               Attorney Dev Das, counsel for Plaintiffs Memory Buss
and MJ Company, LLC.
 
RESPONDING PARTY(S): No response on
eCourt as of 09/24/24
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an action for breach of contract, fraud, and conversion that was
filed on November 13, 2023. Plaintiffs allege Defendants agreed to sell the
application rights for a cannabis retail license to Plaintiffs for $100,000,
but, after receiving the money, demanded a further $60,000 for the application
number necessary to make use of those rights. 
 
Attorney Dev Das, Counsel for
Plaintiffs, moves to be relieved as counsel. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Attorney
Dev Das, Counsel for Plaintiffs, moves to be relieved as counsel. 
 
Moving counsel filed all three required forms (MC-051,
-052, and -053) and filed proofs of service with the Court. Moving counsel served
the motions on the Plaintiffs by mail and confirmed that the addresses were
current by conversation. (MC-052 ¶ 3(b).) 
 
In general, an attorney may withdraw with
or without cause so long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice
to the client’s interest – i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in
the litigation, because that would prejudice client, but can withdraw
otherwise. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904,
915.) The court has discretion to deny an attorney’s request to withdraw where
the withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in the proceeding,
but the court’s discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably. (Mandell
v. Superior Court (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)   
 
            Here, trial in this matter not yet
set, and the only other hearing in this matter is a Case Management Conference
on October 1, 2024 at 8:30 AM. The risk of prejudice to these Plaintiffs is
therefore low. Moving Counsel states that withdrawal is necessary because there
has been an irreparable breakdown of the attorney-client relationship that
makes continuing representation impossible, and the client has failed to pay
attorney’s fees (MC-052 ¶ 2.) In light of the low risk of prejudice to the
parties at this juncture, the Court finds that Moving Counsel has demonstrated
good cause for withdrawal. 
 
Accordingly, Attorney Dev Das’s
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Memory Buss is GRANTED.
 
Attorney Dev Das’s Motion to be
Relieved as Counsel for MJ Company, LLC is GRANTED.
 
The Court sets an Order to Show
Cause Re: Retention of Substitute Counsel by MJ Company, LLC for Wednesday,
October 30, 2024, at 8:30 AM and continues the Case Management Conference to
the same date and time. 
 
This ruling is conditioned on
Moving Counsel submitting updated proposed Orders reflecting the new dates, giving
notice of the signed Order and this ruling to all parties, and filing proof of
service with the Court.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
