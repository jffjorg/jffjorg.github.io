Motion to be Relieved as Counsel for Plaintiff Judith Collie
The court considered the moving papers. No opposition was received.
The court GRANTS Counsel’s motion to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff.
Background
On July 1, 2024, Plaintiff Judith Collie (“Plaintiff”) filed her
Complaint against Defendants Hermes Mejia, Aracely Santoyo, & Does 1-10,
(“Defendants”), alleging unlawful detainer. Plaintiff is the owner of the
Manufactured Home located at 24425 Woolsey Canyon Road Space 46, West Hills, CA
91304 (the “Premises”). Plaintiff alleges that Defendants violated their
Written Promissory Note/ Security Agreement by failing to renew the insurance
policy for the Premises. On June 22, 2024, Defendants were served with a Three Day
Notice to Perform Covenants Or Quit. Plaintiff asserts that Defendants
unlawfully hold over and continue possession of the Premises after the
expiration of said notice without permission of Plaintiff.
The Demurrer hearing is set for January 10, 2025. Trial is not yet set. 
Discussion 
Areg A. Sarkisian (“Counsel”) of the Sarkissian Law Group now moves to be
relieved as counsel of record for Plaintiff Judith Collie. 
The court has
discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be
granted provided that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not
disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant
(1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d
398.) 
California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362 (Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel) requires (1) notice of
motion and motion to be directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion
and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-051)); (2) a declaration
stating in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code of Civil Procedure,
section 284, subdivision (2) is brought instead of filing a consent under Code
of Civil Procedure, section 284, subdivision (1) (made on the Declaration in
Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-052));
(3) service of the notice of motion and motion and declaration on all other
parties who have appeared in the case; and (4) the proposed order relieving
counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as
Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). 
Here, Counsel has filed
Civil forms MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel),
MC-052 (Declaration in Support of Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel),
and MC-053 (Proposed Order). Counsel served Plaintiff and counsel for Defendants
with copies of the motion papers and her declaration by mail and email,
respectively, on November 13, 2024. The instant motion was originally scheduled
to be heard on January 9, 2025 but was advanced to November
26, 2024 by Plaintiff’s ex parte application (Minute Order dated November
19, 2024.) 
Counsel has shown proper basis for
withdrawal and that withdrawal will not prejudice Plaintiff. Prof. Conduct,
Rule 1.16(b)(10) provides that a permissive request for withdrawal may be
properly granted where an attorney believes that the tribunal will find good
cause for withdrawal. Counsel is filing this motion to withdraw from legal
representation due to lack of communication and non-payment of fees. (MC-052,
Items 2 and 7.) Counsel declares that there has been a breakdown of
communication that has created an unreasonably difficult situation. (Id.)
Counsel attests that Plaintiff has breached the terms of their retainer
agreement by not paying her outstanding invoice. (Id.) Despite Counsel’s
numerous attempts to contact Plaintiff, Plaintiff has been unresponsive. This
is a proper basis for withdrawal. (California
Professional Code of Conduct, Rule 1.16(b)(5).) Additionally, there is
no trial scheduled. The Demurrer hearing is set for January 10, 2025. However,
in light of the Demurrer hearing, Counsel requested, ex parte, that the
Court advance the hearing on the instant motion, which was granted. There is no
reason to believe that Counsel’s withdrawal will prejudice Plaintiff. 
The court therefore GRANTS Counsel’s
Motion to be Relieved as Counsel, on the grounds that Counsel has complied with
the proper forms, service, and has explained a proper basis for withdrawal that
is not likely to prejudice Plaintiff. 
 
It is so ordered.
