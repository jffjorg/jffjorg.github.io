And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted counsel's motion to withdraw from representing the plaintiff, Judith Collie, in the unlawful detainer case against Hermes Mejia, Aracely Santoyo, and DOES 1-10. The court found that counsel has shown proper basis for withdrawal due to lack of communication and non-payment of fees by the plaintiff. Counsel has not received payment for services rendered and has not received communication from the plaintiff, creating an unreasonably difficult situation. The court believes that withdrawal will not prejudice the plaintiff and has granted the motion despite the Demurrer hearing set for January 10, 2025.
