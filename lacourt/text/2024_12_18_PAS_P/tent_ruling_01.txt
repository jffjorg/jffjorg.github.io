  Case Number:  23AHCV02326    Hearing Date:   December 18, 2024    Dept:  P [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT’S  MOTION FOR RELIEF FROM WAIVER OF OBJECTIONSI.         INTRODUCTION On October 23, 2023, Plaintiff Vaneza Alfaro (“Plaintiff”) filed a  complaint against Defendant Liliana Deluca (“Defendant”), alleging injuries  arising from an automobile collision. On September 24, 2024, Plaintiff served Defendant with Request for  Production – Set Two, Special Interrogatories – Set Two, and Form  Interrogatories – Set Two via electronic mail. Defendant’s responses were due  on October 28, 2024. Defendant served responses two days later, on October 30,  2024. On November 19, 2024, Defendant filed the instant motion for relief from  waiver of objections. This motion is unopposed.   II.        LEGAL STANDARD C.C.P.  §2030.290(a) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:    If a  party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,  the following rules apply:  (a)¿The  party to whom the interrogatories are directed waives any right to exercise the  option to produce writings under Section 2030.230, as well as any objection to  the interrogatories, including one based on privilege or on the protection for  work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may  relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the  following conditions are satisfied:  (1)¿The  party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2030.210, 2030.220, 2030.230, and 2030.240.  (2)¿The  party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,  inadvertence, or excusable neglect.  C.C.P.  §2031.300 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:  If a  party to whom a demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is  directed fails to serve a timely response to it, the following rules shall  apply:  (a)¿The  party to whom the demand for inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is  directed waives any objection to the demand, including one based on privilege  or on the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 2018.010). The court, on motion, may  relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both of the  following conditions are satisfied:  (1)¿The  party has subsequently served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2031.210, 2031.220, 2031.230, 2031.240, and 2031.280.  (2)¿The  party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,  inadvertence, or excusable neglect.    The court, on motion, may relieve that party from its  waiver on the court’s determination that: (1) the party has subsequently served  a response that is in substantial compliance with the Discovery Act, and (2)  the party’s failure to serve a timely response was the result of mistake,  inadvertence, or excusable neglect.¿¿(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a);  2031.300, subd. (a).) III.      ANALYSIS Defendant moves for relief from waiver of objections to Plaintiff’s  discovery requests, specifically requests for production set two and special  and form interrogatories set two, pursuant to CCP §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a),  and 2033.280(a). Defendant contends that the failure to timely respond was the  result of mistake, inadvertence, and excusable neglect, and that responses  served two days late were in substantial compliance with the Discovery Act.  (Motion, p. 2.) Defendant argues that the discovery responses served two days after the  deadline included appropriate objections and otherwise complied with the  requirements of CCP §§ 2030.210-2030.240, 2031.210-2031.240, and  2033.210-2033.230. Defendant asserts that these responses sufficiently  addressed the substance of the discovery requests, preserving the intent of the  Discovery Act. (Id..; Saravia Decl., ¶¶ 6-8, Exhs. B, C.) Defendant claims the delay was caused by excusable neglect due to the  unexpected absence of Defendant's legal assistant, who contracted COVID and was  out of the office during the period. Defendant’s counsel, heavily reliant on  the assistant’s calendaring system, inadvertently missed the deadline. Upon  realizing the oversight, Defendant immediately served the responses and  requested a short extension from Plaintiff, which Plaintiff denied. (Saravia  Decl., ¶¶ 4-6.) Defendant further asserts that Plaintiff suffered no prejudice because  of the brief delay. (Motion, p. 1.) First, the Court finds that Defendant has provided substantially  compliant responses to Plaintiff’s discovery requests. “‘Substantial compliance, as the phrase is used in the decisions, means  actual compliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable  objective of the statute.’ (Stasher v. Harger–Haldeman (1962) 58 Cal.2d  23, 29.) Where there is compliance as to all matters of substance, technical  deviations are not to be given the stature of noncompliance. [Citation.]  Substance prevails over form.” (Southern Pac. Transportation Co. v. State  Bd. of Equalization (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 438, 442; see also Western  States Petroleum Assn. v. Board of Equalization (2013) 57 Cal.4th 401,  426.) The California Supreme Court has clarified that while the substantial  compliance standard does not require perfection, it does require that each  objective or purpose of a statute is achieved. (Costa v. Superior Court  (2006) 37 Cal.4th 986, 1017, fn. 24.) Here, Defendant has provided responses and objections to Plaintiff’s  discovery requests in the format statutorily required. (Saravia Decl., ¶¶ 6-8,  Exhs. B, C.) Defendant’s responses are sufficient under the Discovery Act, and  if Plaintiff seeks further responses, a motion to compel further is the  appropriate remedy. The Court also finds that Defendant’s failure to timely serve responses  was due to a mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect. The same standard for relief from defaults used in CCP § 473 applies to  motions for relief under CCP §§ 2030.290(a), 2031.300(a), and 2033.280(a). (City  of Fresno v. Superior Court (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1459, 1467.)  “Inadvertence is defined as lack of heedfulness or attentiveness, inattention,  fault from negligence. [Citations.] Inadvertence in the abstract is no plea on  which to vacate a default. [Citation.]” (Baratti v. Baratti (1952) 109  Cal.App.2d 917, 921.) “The ‘excusable neglect’ referred to in [CCP § 473(b)] is  that neglect which might have been the act of a reasonably prudent person under  the same circumstances. [Citation.]” (Id.) “A mistake of fact is when a  person understands the facts to be other than they are; a mistake of law is  when a person knows the facts as they really are but has a mistaken belief as  to the legal consequences of those facts. [Citation.]” (Id.) Defendant’s legal assistant unexpectedly contracted COVID and was unable  to perform the regular task of ensuring deadlines were calendared and brought  to counsel’s attention. (Saravia Decl., ¶¶ 4-5.) This inadvertence resulted in  a two-day delay in serving discovery responses. On October 30, 2024, Defendant  served the discovery responses and immediately sought to resolve the issue by  requesting a short extension from Plaintiff. (Id. at ¶ 6.) These actions  demonstrate that Defendant’s neglect was excusable under the circumstances and  that there was no intentional disregard of discovery obligations. Given that  this motion is unopposed, the Court finds that Defendant’s failure to timely  serve responses was the result of inadvertence and excusable neglect.  Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS the motion for relief.   IV.       CONCLUSION AND ORDER             Accordingly,  The Court GRANTS motion to relief from waiver of objections for Request for  Production – Set Two, Special Interrogatories – Set Two and Form  Interrogatories – Set Two filed by Defendant. Defendant is to give notice.               Dated: December 18, 2024                                                                                                                                                                     JARED D. MOSES JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT  [TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO QUASH SUBPOENA TO HUNTINGTON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL and DENYING SANCTIONSI.         INTRODUCTIONOn October 23, 2023, Plaintiff  Vaneza Alfaro (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendant Liliana Deluca  (“Defendant”), alleging injuries arising from an automobile collision.On October 31, 2023, Defendant  filed instant motion to quash subpoena seeking her medical records from  Huntington Memorial Hospital. Plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion on  December 4, 2023. On December 12, 2023, Defendant filed a reply.   II.        LEGAL STANDARD            Code of  Civil Procedure section 1987.1 states, “When a subpoena requires…the production  of [documents], the court, upon motion reasonably made by the party, the  witness or any consumer described in Section 1985.3…may make an order quashing  the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon such  terms or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective  orders.”  “The court may make any other order as may be appropriate to  protect the parties, the witness, or the consumer from unreasonable or  oppressive demands including unreasonable violations of a witness’s or  consumer’s right of privacy.”  (Id.) As a general rule, all unprivileged  information that is relevant to the subject matter of the action is  discoverable if it would itself be admissible evidence at trial or if it  appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2017.010; Schnabel v. Superior Court. (1993) 5  Cal.4th 704, 711.) When the information sought to be discovered impacts a  person’s constitutional right to privacy, limited protections come into play  for that person. (Shaffer v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 993,  999.) The protections cover both a person’s personal and financial matters. (Id.)  The court must balance competing rights — the right of a litigant to discover  relevant facts and the right of an individual to maintain reasonable privacy —  in determining whether the information is discoverable. (Id.)             For  discovery purposes, information is relevant if it might reasonably assist a  party in evaluating the case, preparing for trial, or facilitating settlement.  (Gonzalez v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546.)  III.      ANALYSISDefendant seeks to quash arguing  that the subpoena violates her constitutional right to privacy. Defendant  contends that her medical condition is not at issue in this litigation, as she  has not asserted any injuries or damages related to the accident. She further  argues that Plaintiff’s subpoena constitutes an improper "fishing  expedition" intended to harass and intimidate, rather than to obtain  relevant evidence. (Motion, pp. 3-6)Plaintiff opposes the motion to  quash, asserting that Defendant waived her privacy rights by voluntarily  testifying about her condition during her deposition. Specifically, Plaintiff  argues that Defendant repeatedly emphasized her lack of injuries and downplayed  the force of the impact to undermine the credibility of Plaintiff’s claimed  injuries. Plaintiff contends that this testimony opened the door to limited  discovery of Defendant’s medical records, as they are directly relevant to  evaluating the force of the impact of the incident and challenging Defendant’s  credibility. (Opposition, pp. 2-6)The Court must¿carefully  balance¿the right of privacy against the need for disclosure.¿¿(Britt v.  Superior Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 855-56; see also¿John B. v.  Superior Court (2006) 38 Cal.4th 1177, 1199.) ¿The¿ascertainment of the  truth¿in connection with legal proceedings is a compelling state interest.¿¿(Britt  v. Superior Court¿(1978) 20 Cal.3d 844, 857.)¿ In balancing the divergent  interests, the court considers the¿purpose of the information sought,  the¿effect that disclosure will have¿on the affected persons and parties,  the¿nature of the objections¿urged by the party resisting disclosure, and  the¿availability of the alternative, less intrusive means¿for obtaining the  requested information.¿¿(Hooser v. Superior Court (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th  997, 1005.)¿ The more sensitive the nature of the personal information that is  sought, the more substantial the showing of the need for the discovery that  will be required before disclosure will be permitted.¿¿(Id. at  1004.) Here, the Court finds that  Defendant’s constitutional right to privacy outweighs Plaintiff’s need for  discovery. Defendant has not placed her medical condition at issue, as she has  made no claims for injuries or damages in connection with this case. While  Defendant did testify during her deposition that she was "fine" and  "not injured," the Court concludes that this testimony does not waive  her privacy rights.Further, on balance, the competing  interests favor Defendant’s privacy rights over Plaintiff’s need to discover  information for impeachment or credibility purposes. Defendant’s medical  records are not essential to resolving the core issue in this case, which is  Plaintiff’s injuries and damages, not Defendant’s condition. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS  Defendant’s motion to quash the subpoena for her medical records.SanctionsDefendant moves the Court for  monetary sanctions against Plaintiff and her counsel, arguing that Plaintiff’s  subpoena constitutes a misuse of the discovery process by seeking irrelevant  and private information that is not reasonably calculated to lead to the  discovery of admissible evidence. (Motion, p.7)Plaintiff also moves the Court for  monetary sanctions, contending that Defendant’s motion to quash is meritless  and that Defendant failed to comply with statutory procedural requirements,  including the timely service of required documents. Plaintiff argues that  Defendant’s failure to withdraw the motion despite multiple meet-and-confer  efforts forced Plaintiff to incur unnecessary attorney’s fees and costs,  warranting sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010(e) and  2025.420(h). (Opposition, pp. 6-8)The Court finds that neither party  is entitled to sanctions. While Defendant’s motion to quash is ultimately  granted, the Court determines that Plaintiff’s opposition was substantially  justified, given the disputed nature of Defendant’s deposition testimony and  Plaintiff’s reasonable belief that the testimony placed Defendant’s medical  condition at issue. Similarly, while Plaintiff’s subpoena may have been overly  broad, the Court finds no evidence that it was issued in bad faith or with the  intent to harass Defendant.Accordingly, the Court DENIES  requests for monetary sanctions. IV.       CONCLUSIONThe Court GRANTS Defendant’s Motion  to Quash Subpoena to Huntington Memorial Hospital.Defendant is to give notice.  Dated: December 18, 2024                                                                                JARED D.
