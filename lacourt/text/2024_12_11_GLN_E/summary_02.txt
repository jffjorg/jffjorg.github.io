Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling is regarding a motion to stay discovery and a request for a protective order. The moving parties, Jamal Dawood and his related entities, are seeking to stay discovery and limit inquiry into certain facts previously dismissed by the court. The judge notes that the parties' papers are incomprehensible and that the case has a history of confusion. The judge will hear argument from the parties and will consider the following issues: whether the stay of discovery is warranted, what specific relief is being sought, and whether the parties are aware of the operative pleadings in the case.
