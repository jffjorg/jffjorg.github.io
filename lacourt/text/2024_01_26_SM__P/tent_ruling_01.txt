Von
Neitsch v. Bedford Dental Group, et al., Case No. 22SMCV01853
Hearing
date January 26, 2024
Defendants’
Demurrer to First Amended Complaint
Plaintiff
alleges dental malpractice and breach of implied contract against defendants
Daniel E. Naysan, D.D.S. and M. Nayssan D.D.S., Inc. Defendants demur to the
breach of contract claim on the ground that it is duplicative of the negligence
claim. 
“A cause of
action for damages for breach of contract is comprised of the following
elements: (1) the contract, (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for
nonperformance, (3) defendant’s breach, and (4) the resulting damages to
plaintiff.”  Durell v. Sharp
Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1367.
Defendants
argue the cause of action for breach of contract alleges the cosmetic dental
services were not performed to plaintiff’s satisfaction, and these allegations
also form the basis for the negligence claim. Because the breach of contract
claim does not add to the amended pleading, defendants argue demurrer should be
sustained.
The parties allegedly
entered into an implied contract wherein defendants were to give plaintiff an
“attractive, balanced smile,” but plaintiff alleges the cosmetic dentistry was
not properly performed. FAC at ¶¶ 16, 18.
Generally, “a
doctor is not a ‘warrantor of cures” and is not “required to guarantee
results.” See Huffman v. Lindquist (1951) 37 Cal.2d 465, 475.
Nevertheless, the court must accept the factual assertions as true, and
allegations are to be liberally construed. See Del E. Webb Corp. v.
Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 604; Code Civ. Proc.
§452. Though this cause of action is based on an implied contract, not an
express one, determination of whether this purported warranty was provided is
beyond the scope of a demurrer.  
Though the
breach of contract claim is premised on the same conduct as the negligence
claim, plaintiff may plead breaches of different duties based on the same
conduct. Code Civ. Proc. §3537. Some cases sustained demurrer on the ground
that a cause of action which merely duplicates another cause of action and adds
nothing to the complaint by way of fact or theory.  E.g., Award Metals v. Superior Court
(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1128, 1135.  However, the better view is that the objection
that a cause of action is duplicative of another in the complaint “is not a
ground on which a demurrer may be sustained.” Blickman Turkus, LP v. MF
Downtown Sunnyvale, LLC (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 858, 890. “[I]t is a waste
of time and judicial resources to entertain a motion challenging part of a
pleading on the sole ground of repetitiveness. (Citation omitted). This is the
sort of defect that, if it justifies any judicial intervention at all, is
ordinarily dealt with most economically at trial, or on a dispositive motion
such as summary judgment.” Id. OVERRULED. Defendants to answer within 15
days.
