And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge regarding a motion for leave to intervene filed by Mercury Insurance Company, the carrier of defendant Demarest, in a related lawsuit filed by plaintiff Rader and another plaintiff, Bauer. The lawsuits stem from a motor vehicle accident, and Mercury Insurance Company is seeking to intervene because it has an interest in the litigation due to its insured, Demarest, not responding to attempts to contact him due to mental health issues. Mercury Insurance Company argues that it will ultimately pay the judgment and that without Demarest's cooperation, it will be difficult to defend the case, and that there could be sanctions imposed for failure to engage in the litigation process. The court has granted the motion for leave to intervene, and Mercury Insurance Company is to file its complaint in intervention within 10 court days.
