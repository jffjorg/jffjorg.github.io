And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court is considering a demurrer to the breach of contract claim in a case involving dental malpractice and breach of implied contract. The defendants argue that the breach of contract claim is duplicative of the negligence claim and adds nothing to the complaint. The court notes that while the two claims are based on the same conduct, a plaintiff may plead breaches of different duties based on the same conduct. The court also notes that it is not a ground for demurrer that a cause of action is duplicative of another in the complaint. Therefore, the court overrules the demurrer and orders the defendants to answer the complaint within 15 days.
