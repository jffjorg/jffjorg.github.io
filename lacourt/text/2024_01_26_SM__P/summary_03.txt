And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge's tentative ruling addresses the demurrer filed by defendant Wong to the complaint filed by plaintiff Rahbar. The complaint alleges that the defendants, DW Investments and Wong, failed to provide safe flooring, which led to Rahbar's injuries. Wong argues that the deed to the property is not in his name, but in the name of the corporate defendant DW, and that the complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.

The Judge rules that the complaint is insufficient to place Wong on notice of the issues and allegations against him. The Judge also notes that the deed may be judicially noticed under California Evidence Code § 452(c) as it is a recorded document. However, the Judge concludes that the deed does not contain sufficient details to demonstrate that the plot of land described is the property at issue.

The Judge sustains Wong's demurrer with 20 days leave to amend the complaint. The Judge's decision is based on the principles of California law, including the requirement that a complaint must allege facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and that a court may not consider declarations, matters not subject to judicial notice or documents not accepted for the truth of their contents.
