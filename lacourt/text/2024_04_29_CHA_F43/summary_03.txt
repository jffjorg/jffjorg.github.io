And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has denied JETNET's motion to seal certain documents, including portions of the asset purchase agreement (APA) and ADSB's reply in support of its demurrer. The judge found that JETNET failed to meet the standards for a sealing order, as it did not provide sufficient evidence of a serious injury that would result from the disclosure of the documents. The judge also found that the request for a sealing order was not narrowly tailored, as it did not specify which portions of the APA or ADSB's reply needed to be sealed. The judge concluded that JETNET's motion was overbroad and failed to establish a likelihood of serious injury apart from the contractual provision itself.
