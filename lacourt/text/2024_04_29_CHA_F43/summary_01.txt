And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court grants the plaintiff's motion to compel compliance with the deposition subpoena of Doug Bend, Esq., for production of business records. The plaintiff, Mina Kateb, seeks non-privileged documents and communications related to Monocent, a company that Kateb claims to be a shareholder of. Bend, the defendant, refuses to produce the requested documents and claims attorney-client privilege. The court finds that Bend has failed to demonstrate the privilege and orders him to produce the non-privileged documents and communications in his possession.
