Moving Party:
Plaintiff Pacific Walnut Center 
Responding Party:
Joseph Esfandi
 
T/R:   PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO
REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET ONE IS GRANTED.
 
DEFENDANT TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO REQUESTS FOR
PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET ONE, WITHOUT OBJECTION, WITHIN 20 DAYS OF NOTICE
OF RULING.
 
PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS IS DENIED.
 
PLAINTIFF TO NOTICE.
 
          The Court
considers the moving papers, opposition, and reply. 
 
“If a party to whom a demand for inspection, copying,
testing, or sampling is directed fails to serve a timely response to it. .
.  [t]he party to whom the demand for
inspection, copying, testing, or sampling is directed waives any objection to
the demand, including one based on privilege or on the protection for work product.
. . .  The party making the demand may
move for an order compelling response to the demand. A party must respond to
interrogatories and requests for production of documents within 30 days after
service. (CCP §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a).) If a party to whom interrogatories
or requests for production of documents are directed does not provide timely
responses, the requesting party may move for an order compelling responses to
the discovery. (CCP §§ 2030.290(b), 2031.300(b).) The party also waives the
right to make any objections, including one based on privilege or work-product
protection. (CCP §§ 2030.290(a); 2031.300(a).)
 
          Plaintiff
Pacific Walnut Center moves to compel responses to Requests for Production of
Documents, Set One from Defendant Joseph Esfandi. Plaintiff served the
subject discovery by email and mail on December 19, 2023. (Kohan Decl. ¶ 3.) On
December 20, 2023, Defense counsel replied to the email stating that he was
Defendant’s new attorney. (Id. ¶ 3.) Responses were due on January 18, 2024. (Linzer
Decl. ¶ 3.) Throughout the month of January of 2023 and into February of 2023,
Plaintiff and Defendant engaged in settlement discussions through their
counsel. (Id.) During this time, both counsel were busy with professional and
personal obligations. As of the filing of the reply, Plaintiff has not received
responses. (Id. at ¶ 5.) The motion is GRANTED.
 
          The Court
does not find sanctions warranted here. Defendant represents that the parties
were in settlement discussions through their counsel. (Linzer Decl. ¶ 3.) Imposition
of sanctions would be unjust under the circumstances; Defendant acted with
justification in not responding during that time. The request for sanctions is
DENIED.
