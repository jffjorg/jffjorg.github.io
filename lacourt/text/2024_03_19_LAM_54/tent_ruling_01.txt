Department 54, Judge Maurice Leiter 
Motion to Lift Stay 
Moving Party:  Plaintiff Mark Merrens
Responding Party:  Defendants Viking River Cruises, Inc. and
Rostislav “Rusty” Karchemsky 
 
T/R:    PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO LIFT STAY IS
DENIED.  
 
PLAINTIFF TO
NOTICE.  
 
The Court considers the moving papers, opposition, and reply.  
 
BACKGROUND 
 
On December 4, 2019, Plaintiff Mark Merrens sued Defendants Viking
River Cruises, Inc., Rostislav Karchemsky, and Vikram Nair, asserting fourteen
causes of action for, among other claims, FEHA violations, whistleblower
retaliation, and wrongful termination.
 
On December 10, 2020, the Court granted the Motion to Compel Arbitration
filed by Defendants Viking River Cruises, Inc. and Rostislav “Rusty” Karchemsky.  The Court ordered the entire case stayed
pending arbitration.
 
Arbitration is currently set for August 2024.  
 
Plaintiff moves to lift the stay against the individual Defendant Vikran
Nair for refusing to arbitrate, or in the alternative, to lift the stay and
remand arbitration proceedings against all Defendants back to court.  
 
 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
 
Defendants submitted various evidentiary objections to the declaration
submitted by Plaintiff in support of his motion.  The Court rules as follows on those
objections. 
 
Sustained: Objections 2, 7 as to “I further inquired and gave notice that without
Defendant Nair’s consent to arbitration, and with Arbitrator White admission
she lacked authority over Defendant Nair, Plaintiff was left with no
alternative but to seek Court intervention/relief,” and 8 as to
“demonstrating that the Arbitration had not power over him.”
 
Overruled: Objections 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
 
  
ANALYSIS 
 
The court in which the litigation is pending is required to “stay
the action or proceeding until an arbitration is had in accordance with the
order to arbitrate or until such earlier time as the court specifies.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1281.4.)  The purpose of Code of Civil Procedure
section 1281.4 is to protect the jurisdiction of the arbitrator by preserving
the status quo until the arbitration is resolved. (MKJA, Inc. v. 123 Fit
Franchising, LLC (2011) 191 Cal.App.4th 643, 660.)  A trial court has the discretion to lift a
stay prior to the completion of arbitration only when lifting the stay would
not frustrate the arbitrator's jurisdiction. 
(Id.)  “[T]he trial court is not
required to stay all proceedings against the defendants who are not entitled to
arbitration; the court may, in its discretion, sever the action as to [those
defendants] or limit any stay to those issues subject to arbitration.”  (Madden
v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (1976) 17 Cal.3d 699, 714.)
   
          As noted, on
December 10, 2020, the Court granted the motion of Viking River Cruises, Inc.
and Karchemsky to compel arbitration. At that time Defendant Nair had not yet appeared
in the case.  
 
Plaintiff argues that Nair has refused to arbitrate, and the arbitration
hearing and the case in this Court can proceed concurrently as separate claims
against the individuals. Alternatively. Plaintiff asks the Court to lift the
stay against all Defendants because there could be inconsistent/conflicting
rulings on common issues of law or fact. 

 
          Plaintiff has not shown
that Nair was served with a demand to arbitrate. Nor has Plaintiff shown that
the order sending the case to arbitration applies to Nair, who had not been
served at the time the motion to compel arbitration was decided. And Plaintiff
has not shown that the case should proceed separately against Nair.
 
Plaintiff’s motion is DENIED.

Motion to Quash Service of Summons
Moving Party:  Defendant Vikram Nair
Responding Party:  Plaintiff Mark Merrens 
 
T/R:    DEFENDANT VIKRAM NAIR’S MOTION TO QUASH
SERVICE OF SUMMONS IS GRANTED.  
 
DEFENDANT TO NOTICE.  
 
The Court considers the moving papers, opposition, reply, and sur-reply.  
 
BACKGROUND 
 
On December 4, 2019, Plaintiff Mark Merrens sued Defendants Viking
River Cruises, Inc., Rostislav Karchemsky, and Vikram Nair, asserting fourteen
causes of action for, among other claims, FEHA violations, whistleblower
retaliation, and wrongful termination.
 
On December 10, 2020, the Court granted the Motion to Compel Arbitration
filed by Defendants Viking River Cruises, Inc. and Rostislav “Rusty” Karchemsky.  The Court ordered the entire case stayed

Arbitration is currently set for August 2024.  
 
Before the Court is Defendant Vikran Nair’s motion to quash service of
summons. 
 
EVIDENTIARY OBJECTIONS
 
Defendant Nair submitted various evidentiary objections to Plaintiff’s
declaration in support of opposition.  The
Court rules as follows on those objections.
Sustained: Objections 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
Overruled: None.
 Defendant Nair also submitted an evidentiary objection to Plaintiff
counsel’s declaration in support of opposition. 
The Court rules as follows on those objections.
 Sustained: None.
 Overruled: Objection 1.
 
  
ANALYSIS 
Motion to Quash 
 
“A defendant, on or
before the day of his or her time to plead . . . may serve and file a notice of
motion . . . [t]o quash service of summons on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction of the court over him or her.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 418.10(a)(1).) 
By filing such motion, “a defendant makes a special appearance for the narrow
purpose of contesting personal jurisdiction where the summons is
defective.”  (Stancil v. Superior Court (2021) 11 Cal.5th 381,
393.) 
 
“In the absence of a
voluntary submission to the authority of the court, compliance with the
statutes governing service of process is essential to establish that court’s
personal jurisdiction over a defendant.”  (Floveyer International, Ltd.
v. Superior Court (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 789, 793; see also Calvert v. Al
Binali (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 954, 961 [“To establish personal jurisdiction,
it is essential to comply with the statutory procedures for service of
process.”].)  “When a defendant
challenges that jurisdiction by bringing a motion to quash, the burden is on
the plaintiff to prove the existence of jurisdiction by proving, inter alia,
the facts requisite to an effective service.”  (Lebel v. Mai (2012)
210 Cal.App.4th 1154, 1160, internal quotations omitted.) 
 
“A summons may be
served by personal delivery of a copy of the summons and of the complaint to
the person to be served.”  (Code Civ. Proc. § 415.10.)  “‘[P]ersonal
service,’ generally speaking, means the actual delivery of the process to the
defendant in person . . . .”  (Wilson v. Eddy (1969) 2 Cal.App.3d
613, 617.)  Personal delivery is the “preferred way to serve a defendant”
because it “is the most likely to ensure actual notice to the defendant.” 
(Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University v. Ham (2013)
216 Cal.App.4th 330, 336.) 
 
Discussion 
 
Nair moves for an order
quashing the service of summons in this action on the basis that the summons
and complaint were not properly served  Nair
argues that (1) contrary
to the proof of personal service filed by Plaintiff on December 29, 2023,
Defendant Nair was not, nor could he have been personally served on December
27, 2023, at his apartment in New Jersey because he was in California at the
time; (2) no one was in Defendant Nair’s apartment on December 27, 2023, and he
had not authorized anyone to accept service of process on his behalf; and (3)
contrary to the proof of service filed by the Plaintiff on January 17, 2020,
Defendant Nair’s usual place of business on January 13, 2020, was not 5700
Canoga Avenue, Suite 200, Woodland Hills, CA 91367, as he had not worked at
that location for almost one year. Nair provides his own declaration; it shows
that Nair took United Airlines flight 468 from Newark to San Francisco on
December 22, 2023, and returned to New Jersey on December 28, 2023 via United
Airlines flight 1900.  
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that Nair
has failed proffer sufficient evidence that supports his traveling. Plaintiff
provides the proof of service filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on December
29, 2023.  It states that Defendant Nair
was personally served at his address of 7 Livingston Ave., 4 Apt. 2205, New
Brunswick, NJ 08901 on December 27, 2023. 

 
Defendant Nair filed a sur-reply in
response to the supplemental declaration of Plaintiff’s counsel whereby counsel
attests Defendant Nair was again served via personal service on February 16,
2024.  (Supplemental Declaration of
Travis Beck, ¶ 2; Ex. “C.”)  Defendant Nair argues in sur-reply
that Plaintiff’s December 27, 2023, and February 16, 2024, proofs of service
conflict in their physical description of Defendant Nair.  (Sur-reply, pp. 2-3.)  Specifically, the former proof of service
provides: “The individual appeared to be a black-haired Middle Eastern male
contact 55-65 years of age, 5'6"-5'8" tall and weighing 160-180 lbs
with an accent.”  The latter proof of
service provides: “The individual appeared to be a brown-haired Asian male
contact 55-65 years of age, 5'6"-5'8" tall and weighing 160-180 lbs
with an accent.”  (Id.)
 
Since Defendant Nair challenge service of process, Plaintiff carries the
burden of proving valid service.  (See Coulston
v. Cooper (1966) 245 Cal.App.2d 866, 868; BBA Aviation PLC v. Superior
Court (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 421, 428-29.) 
 
The filing of a proof of
service by a registered process server in compliance with statutory
requirements creates a rebuttable presumption of proper service.  (Dill v. Berquist Const. Co., Inc.
(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1426, 1441-1442; Evid. Code, § 647.)  According to the proofs of services, John
Diaraneo and Michael Wienshenker personally served the summons and complaint on
Defendant Nair on December 27, 2023, and February 16, 2024, respectively.  Neither person who served the papers, however,
is a registered California process server. 
The rebuttable presumption does not apply.  In addition, the proofs of service state that
Nair confirmed his identify to the process server, but there is no information that
either process server confirmed Nair’s identify. Also, the disparity in
physical descriptions between the two proofs of service undermines Plaintiff’s
motion. 
 
Plaintiff
has not met his burden of proving facts requisite to effect service. Nair’s
motion to quash is GRANTED.
