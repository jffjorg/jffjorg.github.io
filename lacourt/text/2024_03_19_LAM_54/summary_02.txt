And here is the summary in English text:

The plaintiff, Pacific Walnut Center, moves to compel responses to Requests for Production of Documents, Set One from the defendant, Joseph Esfandi. The plaintiff served the discovery by email and mail on December 19, 2023, and responses were due on January 18, 2024. However, the defendant failed to respond. The court grants the motion and orders the defendant to serve verified responses to the requests for production of documents, set one, without objection, within 20 days of notice of the ruling.

The plaintiff also requests sanctions against the defendant in the amount of $1,261.65, claiming that the defendant's delay caused unnecessary expenses. However, the court denies the request, finding that the parties were in settlement discussions through their counsel during the relevant period and that imposition of sanctions would be unjust.

The court notes that if a party fails to respond to a discovery request, they waive any objections to the request, including those based on privilege or work-product protection. The court cites relevant California Code of Procedure sections to support its ruling.
