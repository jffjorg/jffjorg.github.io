And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the defendant's motion to quash the service of summons. The defendant, Bela, Inc., was served via substituted service on January 9, 2024, and personal service on March 14, 2024. The plaintiff, Glow Med Spa, Inc., filed proof of service on January 11, 2024, and a second proof of service on April 2, 2024. The defendant argues that it cannot be served because it is a terminated legal entity, but the plaintiff argues that terminated entities may still be served and that the defendant's service was valid. The judge finds that the plaintiff's proofs of service are prima facie evidence of proper service and that the defendant has not produced evidence that it was not served. The judge cites relevant California law and court cases to support its decision, including Cal. Corp. Code § 2010(a) and § 2011(a), which state that a dissolved corporation may still be served and sued. The judge also notes that the defendant continues to run a website, which suggests that it is still an active business. Therefore, the judge denies the defendant's motion to quash the service of summons.
