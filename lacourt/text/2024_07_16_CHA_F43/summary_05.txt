And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling grants the motion of Cross-Defendant Dennis McConnell to set aside or vacate the default entered against him in the case of Erik L. Lassman vs. Dorene Robinson. The default was entered on May 1, 2024, after Road Runner Land & Homes, LLC (Road Runner) filed a proof of service indicating that McConnell was served via substituted service at 30330 Byfield Rd., Castaic, CA. However, McConnell claims that he never received the cross-complaint and only learned of the lawsuit when Cross-Defendant Lassman brought it to his attention. The court finds that McConnell has met the requirements of CCP Section 473(b) and grants his motion, deeming his answer filed.
