SUMMARY OF
ACTION
On October 17,
2023, Cross-Complainant Road Runner Land & Homes, LLC (Road Runner) filed a
cross-complaint for unlawful detainer against Cross-Defendant Dennis McConnell
(McConnell). The cross-complaint alleges restitution, constructive trust and
unjust enrichment, and damages for the cancellation of a grand deed issued by
McConnell.
 
Road Runner
filed a proof of service indicating that McConnell was served on January 23,
2024, via substituted service at 30330 Byfield Rd., Castaic, CA. On May 1, 2024,
Road Runner filed a request for entry of default that was entered the same day.
On May 22, 2024, McConnell filed a motion to set aside/vacate default.
 
McConnell
argues in his motion that he never received the cross-complaint, as he has not
lived at 30330 Byfield Rd. since May 2022. (McConnell Decl., ¶ 4; Ex. 101.) While
the proof of service indicates that McConnell was served via substituted
service, McConnell claims that he did not become aware of this lawsuit until
Cross-Defendant Lassman brought the lawsuit to his attention.
 
ANALYSIS
CCP Section
473(b) states as follows: 
The court may, upon any terms as may be
just, relieve a party…from a judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding
taken against him or her through his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or
excusable neglect. Application for this relief shall be accompanied by a copy
of the answer or other pleading proposed to be filed therein, otherwise the
application shall not be granted, and shall be made within a reasonable time,
in no case exceeding six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or
proceeding was taken.
 
The law favors
hearings on the merits, so any doubts as to the application of section 473
should be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default. (See Shapiro
v. Clark (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1128, 1139-1140.) Furthermore, a trial
court has wide discretion to grant relief under CCP § 473(d). (Berman v.
Klassman (1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 900, 909.)
 
In this case, McConnell
would have surprise or excusable neglect if the complaint was never served on
him, and he did not learn of the cross-complaint against him until hearing
about it from Cross-Defendant Lassman. (McConnell Decl., ¶ 5.) McConnell has
also met the other requirements of CCP § 473 because he accompanied his motion
with a copy of the answer he wants to file and made the motion within six
months of entry of default. Furthermore, the law favors hearings on the merits,
so any doubts should be resolved in McConnell’s favor.
 
The Court
grants McConnell’s motion.
 
CONCLUSION
McConnell’s
motion to set aside and vacate entry of default is granted. McConnell’s answer
is deemed filed.
 
Moving party to
give notice.
