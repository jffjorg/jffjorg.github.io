And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendants to Cross-Complainants' four causes of action (breach of contract, express indemnity, breach of guaranty, and declaratory relief) is overruled in its entirety.

Regarding the First Cause of Action for breach of contract, the judge finds that Cross-Complainants have sufficiently alleged a cause of action based on the terms of the Lease Agreement. The judge notes that the Lease Agreement requires Cross-Defendants to confirm the presence and availability of electrical services and to indemnify Cross-Complainants for any costs resulting from electrical service insufficiencies.

Regarding the Second Cause of Action for express indemnity, the judge finds that Cross-Complainants have sufficiently alleged a cause of action based on the express indemnification provision in the Lease Agreement.

Regarding the Third Cause of Action for breach of guaranty, the judge finds that Cross-Complainants have sufficiently alleged a cause of action based on the Guaranty of Lease, which guarantees the prompt payment of rents and the faithful performance of the Lease Agreement by Cross-Defendants.

Regarding the Fourth Cause of Action for declaratory relief, the judge finds that a claim for declaratory relief is a proper request in this case, as Cross-Complainants are seeking to determine the parties' rights and obligations concerning their claim for express indemnity. The judge notes that a claim for declaratory relief is ripe in this case because it is necessary to determine Cross-Complainants' right to indemnity before any damages are incurred.

Overall, the judge's tentative ruling is favorable to Cross-Complainants, allowing their causes of action to proceed to the next stage of litigation.
