SUMMARY OF
ACTION
This case,
filed on December 14, 2023, is related to a dispute involving the unauthorized
commercial use of a likeness and trademark dilution. Plaintiff Glow Med Spa,
Inc., (Plaintiff) filed proof of service on January 11, 2024. The proof of
service indicates that Defendant Bela, Inc., (Defendant) was served via
substituted served on January 9, 2024. The process server indicates that the
documents were left with an employee of Defendant at Defendant’s office or
usual place of business. After that, the process server indicates that the
documents were mailed on January 10, 2024.
 
On February 7,
2024, Defendant filed its motion to quash service of summons. On April 2, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a second proof of service that indicates that the process
server served the complaint on Defendant’s agent for service of process via
personal service on March 14, 2024.
 
The sole basis
for Defendant’s motion to quash is that it cannot be served because it is a
terminated legal entity. Plaintiff argues in its opposition, filed on July 2,
2024, that courts still have jurisdiction over terminated legal entities; that
the case law cited by Defendant is a mix of unpublished opinions and superior
court cases; and that Plaintiff’s service of process was valid.
 
Defendant has
not filed a reply to Plaintiff’s opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
The return of
process is prima facie evidence of proper service. (Evidence Code § 647; Los
Angeles v. Morgan (1951) 105 Cal.2d 726, 731.) Where proof of service
exists, the burden is then on the other party to produce evidence that they
were not, in fact, served. (See Evidence Code § 604; Palm Property
Investments, LLC v. Yadegar 194 Cal.App.4th 1419.) Simply denying receipt
of service is not sufficient to overcome the presumption of service. (Palm
Property, 194 Cal.App.4th at 1428.)
 
Plaintiff has
filed proofs of service that are prima facie evidence of service, including
both the original substituted service and subsequent personal service.
Defendant has not produced evidence that it was not served. Instead, Defendant
argues that it cannot be served because it is a terminated legal entity. In
support of this argument, Defendant cites two unpublished cases, which have no
precedential value. (See Cal. Rules of Court Rule 8.1115(a).) The first is Chang
v. City of Upland (Cal. Ct. App., June 25, 2009, No. E046204) 2009 WL
1816645. Even if this case held some persuasive value, it does not appear to
stand for the proposition that terminated entities cannot be sued. The crux of Chang
was that the Plaintiff failed to name certain defendants in her complaint. It
is not applicable to the current case. The same can be said for Turner v.
Hertz Corporation (Cal. Ct. App., May 30, 2014, No. F065250) 2014 WL
2432891, which Defendant cites but only deals with whether an estate was
properly served.
 
Furthermore,
Plaintiff cites authority in its opposition that supports its argument that
terminated entities may be served. Plaintiff cites Cal. Corp. Code § 2010(a),
which states, “A corporation which is dissolved nevertheless continues to exist
for the purpose of winding up its affairs, prosecuting and defending actions by
or against it and enabling it to collect and discharge obligations…”
Additionally, Corp. Code § 2010(b) states, “No action or proceeding to which a
corporation is a party abates by the dissolution of the corporation or by
reason of proceedings for winding up and dissolution thereof.” Claims may be
asserted against a dissolved corporation irrespective of whether they arose
before or after dissolution, and the corporation remains liable. (See Corp.
Code § 2011(a).) Based on these code sections, Defendant was properly served,
regardless of whether it was a terminated entity, as terminated entities may
still sue or be sued.
 
Plaintiff also
argues that Defendant is still an active business because it continues to run a
website (See Farivar Decl., ¶ 11, Ex. E), but even if it were not an active
business, Plaintiff could still maintain an action against it.
 
Because Defendant
was properly served, regardless of its active status, then Defendant’s motion
to quash service of summons is denied.
 
Moving party to
