And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Shi Pei Wu vs. Lowe's Home Centers, LLC. The case involves a demurrer with motion to strike filed by the defendant, which was intended to challenge the validity of the plaintiff's complaint. However, instead of filing an opposition, the plaintiff timely filed an amended complaint on July 2, 2024, which moots the defendant's demurrer and motion to strike. As a result, the Judge has ruled that the demurrer and motion to strike are no longer relevant and are dismissed. The Judge has instructed the moving party to give notice to all parties.
