And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiffs' motion to reopen discovery, which was filed to allow them to bring a motion to strike the defendants' "improper second round of admissions" and eliminate improper objections in the first admissions. The judge finds that the motion is not necessary because it is based on a flawed understanding of the law and would likely be denied. The judge also finds that reopening discovery would not prevent the case from going to trial or cause prejudice to the defendants. The judge notes that the plaintiffs' motion to reopen discovery is denied without prejudice, meaning that they may refile the motion in the future if necessary.
