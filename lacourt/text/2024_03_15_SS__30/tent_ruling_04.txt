An Order to Show Cause re Dismissal for Failure to File Serve Summons and

Court may dismiss the action, and/or impose sanctions against Counsel for
Plaintiff, at the time of the Order to Show Cause hearing if counsel or parties
fail to appear, or fail to give good cause for the delay in serving the summons
and complaint.  Matter is also to be calendared for trial in nine

Legal Standard
Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b) provides for mandatory and
discretionary relief from dismissal. “The court may, upon any terms as may be
just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him through his or her
mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” CCP §473(b). Where such
an application for discretionary relief is made, the motion shall be
accompanied by a copy of the answer or pleading proposed to be filed, or the
application will not be granted. (Id.) The court must grant relief from
dismissal where the application is accompanied by an attorney affidavit
attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. (Id.) In
either case, the application must be made within a reasonable time, and in no
case exceeding six months after the judgment. (Id.)
Discussion
Plaintiffs moves for mandatory relief on the ground that
dismissal was entered due to the mistake, inadvertence, or neglect of their
counsel.
On January 6, 2023, this Court dismissed this case without
prejudice pursuant to CCP 581(b)(3) when no party appeared for trial. Counsel
for Plaintiffs provides a declaration signed under penalty of perjury,
attesting that the failure to appear was due to his office’s mistake in
calendaring the date of the matter. (Behjatnia Decl., ¶ 4.) Although no
affidavit from the staff member who mistakenly calendared the date has been
proffered, the Court finds the attorney's affidavit of fault to be sufficient.
The Court finds that Plaintiff has established an excusable ground for relief
and grants the motion.
Accordingly, the dismissal entered on January 6, 2023 is
set aside.
