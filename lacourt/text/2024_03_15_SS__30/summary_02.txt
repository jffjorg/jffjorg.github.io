Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

Defendant Maria E. Sanchez moves for summary judgment, arguing that she owes no duty to plaintiff Bruce McKinley Woods because she is an adjacent homeowner of the public sidewalk and did not create or control the condition. The court finds that defendant has presented sufficient evidence to meet her burden on summary judgment, showing that she did not plant the tree that caused the uplift in the sidewalk and did not own or control the public sidewalk. The court also finds that Los Angeles Municipal Code, section 62.104 does not impose liability on defendant in clear and unambiguous language. As a result, defendant is entitled to summary judgment.
