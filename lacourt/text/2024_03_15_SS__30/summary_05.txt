Summary:
The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, dismissing the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff alleges negligence and negligent hiring, supervision, and retention by the defendant, but the judge finds that the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to support these claims. The judge rules that the defendant did not have a duty to protect the plaintiff from the assault, and that the plaintiff failed to show that the defendant knew or should have known that its employees were unfit or that they exhibited a particular risk of harm. The judge also finds that the plaintiff's request to amend the complaint is denied as there is no reasonable possibility of successfully amending the pleadings.
