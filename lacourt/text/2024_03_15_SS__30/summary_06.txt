And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the defendant's motions to compel responses to form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and request for production of documents, as well as the defendant's request for sanctions. The defendant served discovery requests on August 8, 2023, and responses were due on or before September 9, 2023. However, the plaintiff failed to serve responses by the due date. The defendant has now served verified responses to the discovery requests, making the motions to compel moot. The judge has denied the motions to compel as moot.

The defendant has also requested sanctions for the plaintiff's failure to serve responses to the discovery requests. However, the judge has denied the request for sanctions because the notice of motion did not identify who the sanctions were sought against. Therefore, the motions to compel and the request for sanctions are denied.
