  - Defendant Wynn Capital Management SRL

Significant Statements:
  - "A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether the complaint states a cause of action."
  - "Because a demurrer challenges defects on the face of the complaint, it can only refer to matters outside the pleading that are subject to judicial notice."
  - "The court begins with the first argument. Irina cites Corporations Code section 17704.09 for the proposition that a non-managing member does not owe fiduciary duties."
  - "The court agrees with this observation. The Complaint does not contain allegations demonstrating deceptive or misleading practices that could constitute a cause of action for common law unfair competition."
  - "The issue of whether a wrongdoer's conduct in any manner constituted a 'theft' is elucidated by other provisions of the Penal Code defining theft, such as Penal Code section 484."
