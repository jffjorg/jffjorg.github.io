And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses the claims brought by the plaintiffs against Irina, who is accused of breaching her duties of loyalty, care, and fair dealing as a member of the limited liability company FlightHelp. The judge agrees that the complaint sets forth sufficient allegations of Irina's breaches, but notes that Wyoming law (which governs the company's operating agreement) provides that a member does not have any fiduciary duty to the company or to any other member solely by reason of being a member. The judge also finds that the complaint is vague regarding the "Partnership's" profits and that the claims for conversion and accounting are not inconsistent. The judge rejects Irina's argument that this cause of action is inconsistent with the plaintiffs' conversion claim, citing a California Supreme Court case that allows plaintiffs to set forth alternative theories in varied and inconsistent counts.
