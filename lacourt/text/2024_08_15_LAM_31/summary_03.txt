And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to expunge the lis pendens filed by the lender. The lender sought to expunge the lis pendens because the plaintiff failed to provide proper notice of the lis pendens, as required by California Civil Procedure Code section 405.22. The court finds that the plaintiff failed to provide proper notice, which is fatal to the validity of the lis pendens. As a result, the court grants the motion to expunge the lis pendens.

The lender also sought attorney's fees and costs, which the court awards in the sum of $2,500. The court finds that the lender is the prevailing party and therefore entitled to attorney's fees and costs.

The court notes that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate a probability of success on the merits of the case, but does not address this issue because the plaintiff's failure to provide proper notice is fatal to the validity of the lis pendens.
