[1] Plaintiffs explain that the partnership agreement is comprised of oral, written, and implied elements.  FlightHelp’s Operating Agreement appears to supply the written portion of the partnership agreement.  However, as discussed herein, an “integration” clause in the Operating Agreement presents obstacles to Plaintiffs’ allegations that the partnership agreement is likewise comprised of oral and implied elements.[2] Irina points out that the Operating Agreement is governed by Wyoming law (see Complaint, ¶ 6, Ex. A, pg. 2), but would not change the result.  The court agrees.  Wyoming Corp. Code. § 17-29-409(g) provides in relevant part: “In a manager-managed limited liability company, the following rules apply: … (v) A member does not have any fiduciary duty to the company or to any other member solely by reason of being a member.” Wyoming law is in accord with California law on this issue.[3] To be clear, the court agrees with Jordan that the Complaint sets forth sufficient allegations of Irina’s breaches of the duties of loyalty, care, and fair dealing.  But Sections 17704.09 and 15903.05 clearly state that Irina does not owe those duties as a fiduciary. [4] To the extent Plaintiff alleges a “partnership” independent of FlightHelp, the Complaint is vague.  Plaintiffs flip back and forth between claiming the partnership is FlightHelp and there is some unspecified, undefined independent partnership.   [5] To the extent Plaintiff argues Defendants are holding 49% of the “Partnership’s” profits, the Complaint is vague with respect to what partnership is at issue.   [6]  The full quotation from the California Supreme Court case is: “In an action based on a written contract, a plaintiff may plead the legal effect of the contract rather than its precise language.” (Construction Protective Services, Inc. v. TIG Specialty Ins. Co. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 189, 198–199.) [7] The California Supreme Court stated in full:  As observed ante, footnote 7, the final sentences of section 496(a) provide: “A principal in the actual theft of the property may be convicted pursuant to this section. However, no person may be convicted both pursuant to this section and of the theft of the same property.” This language, which was added in 1992, was designed to address difficulties of prosecution in the circumstance in which a thief steals property and then keeps it until after the statute of limitations has run. (See Allen, supra, 21 Cal.4th 846, 858, 89 Cal.Rptr.2d 279, 984 P.2d 486, citing and quoting 4 Stats. 1992, ch. 1146, § 2, p. 5375.) In Allen we characterized the resulting statutory language as “authoriz[ing] a conviction for receiving stolen property even though the defendant also stole the property, provided he has not actually been convicted of the theft.” (Allen, at p. 857, 89 Cal.Rptr.2d 279, 984 P.2d 486.) So viewed, the statutory language is inconsistent with the assertion in Lacagnina’s dictum that section 496(a) contemplates that property must already have been stolen when it comes into the defendant's hands. Neither, we observe, does more recent federal authority support Lacagnina’s dictum. Granted, when Lacagnina was filed, the cited federal district court's unpublished decision construed the statute as requiring a showing that when the property in question comes into the defendant's hands, it must already have the character of having been stolen. But, as alluded to earlier, on review of the district court's decision in Grouse River, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit appears to have disapproved such a reading of the statute. (Grouse River Outfitters, Ltd. v. Oracle Corp., supra, 848 Fed. Appx. 238, 242–243.) Nor have other federal district courts, in well-reasoned decisions, mentioned any such asserted requirement in the course of applying section 496 and permitting treble damages and attorney's fees in analogous “theft of funds” circumstances. (See Allure, supra, 606 B.R. 51, 63–66; Otte, supra, 624 B.R. 883, 911–913.) (Siry Inv., L.P. v. Farkhondehpour, supra, 13 Cal. 5th at p. 354, fn. 8.) [8] Irina also argues that this cause of action is inconsistent with Plaintiffs’ conversion claim. The challenge is not well taken.  To the extent the claims for conversion and accounting are inconsistent, it is well-settled that “modern rules of pleading generally permit plaintiffs to set forth alternative theories in varied and inconsistent counts[.]”  (Klein v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1342, 1388.)  The ninth cause of action does not fail for inconsistency. [9] Indeed, Plaintiffs’ own evidence confirms that Wynn’s principal place of business is Romania.  (See Jordan Decl., Ex. 194 (FlightHelp’s standard ‘Assignment Form’ stating that “WYNN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT SRL, with the principal place of business in Caiova, str. Paringului, nr. 72A jud. Dolj, tax registration number 47078863, J16/2956/26/10.2022[.]”].)
