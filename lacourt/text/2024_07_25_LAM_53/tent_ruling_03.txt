MOVING PARTY:                 Plaintiff Equitable Plaza, LLC           
 
RESPONDING PARTY:       n/a
Motion to Vacate Default and Default Judgment and Order
The court
considered the moving papers filed in connection with this motion.  No opposition papers were filed. 
DISCUSSION
On July 25, 2023, plaintiff Equitable Plaza, LLC (“Plaintiff”) filed
its Complaint for unlawful detainer in this action against defendant Last
Management, LLC (“Defendant”).
The clerk entered Defendant’s default on November 21, 2023.  Thereafter, on December 1, 2023, the clerk
entered default judgment for possession in favor of Plaintiff and against
Defendant as to the premises located at 3435 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 2170,
Los Angeles, California, 90010.  (UD-110,
¶¶ 1, 4.)  On February 26, 2024,
Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal of this entire action without
prejudice.  (CIV-110, ¶ 1.)  The clerk entered dismissal of this action as
requested by Plaintiff on February 27, 2024. 
(CIV-100, ¶ 4.)
Plaintiff now moves the court for an order vacating Defendant’s
default and the resulting default judgment entered in Plaintiff’s favor and
against Defendant.  Plaintiff moves for
this relief on the ground that “as of January 16, 2024, Plaintiff and Defendant
have entered into a new lease amendment that addresses Defendant’s outstanding
balance.”  (Mot., p. 2:1-3; Cha Decl., ¶¶
3-4.)  
“When a court has jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter of
a suit, its jurisdiction continues until a final judgment is entered.  [Citation.] 
When there is a voluntary dismissal of an entire action, the court’s jurisdiction
over the parties and the subject matter terminates.”  (Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97
Cal.App.4th 249, 437 [internal citation omitted].)  Plaintiff has not cited authority
establishing that (1) the court has jurisdiction over this action following
Plaintiff’s dismissal of the action without prejudice, or (2) the court may vacate
the default and default judgment entered in its favor and against Defendant.  
The court therefore denies Plaintiff’s motion.
ORDER
            The court denies plaintiff Equitable
Plaza, LLC’s motion to vacate default and default judgment and order.
            The court directs the clerk to give
notice of this order.   
IT IS SO ORDERED.
 
DATED:  July 25, 2024
