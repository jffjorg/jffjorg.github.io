defendants’ motion for summary judgment or,

MOVING PARTIES:              Defendants Keiko Hasegawa, as an individual and as personal representative of the Estate of
Mulyadi T.S. Sentoso, and Philip Sentoso, as personal representative of the
Estate of Mulyadi T.S. Sentoso

 
RESPONDING PARTY:        Plaintiff Haryati T.S. Sentoso
Motion for Summary Judgment or, in the Alternative, Summary
Adjudication
Defendants Keiko Hasegawa, as an individual and as personal
representative of the Estate of Mulyadi T.S. Sentoso, and Philip Sentoso, as
personal representative of the Estate of Mulyadi T.S. Sentoso (“Defendants”)
filed the pending motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, summary
adjudication against plaintiff Haryati T.S. Sentoso (“Plaintiff”) on June 12,
2023. 
On May 30, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition to Defendants’ motion,
representing that “this case has been settled” and that the parties would be
“submitting a Stipulated Judgment in this case consistent with the terms of the
Settlement Agreement.”  (May 30, 2024 Opp.,
pp. 1:24, 2:1-2.)  Defendants did not (1)
file a reply disputing this representation, or (2) take this motion off
calendar as moot before the June 13, 2024 hearing on this motion.  
            Pursuant to Plaintiff’s
representations, the court issued an order on June 13, 2024 exercising its
discretion to continue the hearing on Defendants’ motion to July 25, 2024, at
10:00 a.m., in Department 53. 
The parties have not filed a Stipulated Judgment with the court, nor has
Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement of Entire Case.  However, on July 11, 2024, Plaintiff filed a
second opposition to Defendants’ motion, in which Plaintiff (1) opposes the
motion on the ground that “this case has been settled[,]” (2) states that, on
May 9, 2024, the Probate Court in the case Estate of Mulyadi Tirto Susielo
Sentoso (Case No. 20STPB02178) granted Plaintiff’s motion to enforce the
settlement agreement pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6, and (3)
states that Defendants’ counsel advised Plaintiff’s counsel that Defendants
appealed the Probate Court’s order granting Plaintiff’s motion to enforce
settlement.  (May 30, 2024 Opp., p. 1:20-24;
July 11, 2024 Opp., pp. 1:23-2:6.)  On
July 12, 2024, Defendants filed a “Notice of Filing of Appeal in Related Case,”[1]
advising the court that Defendants filed an appeal of the court’s order
granting Plaintiff’s motion to enforce the settlement agreement in the probate action.  (Def. Notice of Appeal, pp. 1:25-2:4 and Ex.
A [Notice of Appeal and Designation of Record].)
Plaintiff has attached a copy of the order granting the motion to
enforce settlement agreement, issued by the court in the probate action on May
9, 2024, in which the Probate Court (1) set forth the terms of the settlement
agreement, including that it (i) was executed by Plaintiff, Defendants, and
their respective counsel, (ii) provides for the payment of $450,000 to
Plaintiff from the Estate of Mulyadi Sentoso, (iii) requires the entry of a
stipulated judgment “in a related civil action” in Plaintiff’s favor for
$2,550,000, and (iv) requires the dismissal of individual claims asserted
against defendant Keiko Hasegawa in the civil action, and (2) granted
Plaintiff’s motion to enforce the settlement agreement over the objection of
Defendants.  (May 9, 2024 Order, pp. 1,
5.)  Although the Probate Court’s order
did not identify the related civil action to be this case and the parties did
not submit a copy of the settlement agreement to the court in this case, both
Plaintiff and Defendants appear to agree that the settlement agreement that was
the subject of the court’s order provided for the settlement of this
action.  (July 11, 2024 Opp., pp. 1:23
[opposing motion on the grounds that this action was settled], 2:7-9 [requesting
the court deny the motion and set an Order to Show Cause re status of appeal
based on the parties’ settlement and possible appeal of the order issued in the
probate action]; Def. Notice of Appeal, p. 2:4-6 [stating that Defendants
appealed the order “granting a motion to enforce a settlement agreement between
the parties in this action”].)  
The parties also appear to contend that this action is stayed by
Defendants’ filing of their appeal of the Probate Court’s order granting
Plaintiff’s motion to enforce settlement in the probate action.  (Pl. July 11, 2024 Opp., p. 2:4-5 [“the
appeal could result in a stay of the order enforcing the settlement”], 2:7-8;
Def. Notice of Appeal, p. 2:7-8 [“the appeal stays the proceedings in this
matter”]; Code Civ. Proc., § 916, subd. (a) [Except as otherwise provided, “the
perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in the trial court upon the judgment
or order appealed from or upon the matters embraced therein or affected
thereby, including enforcement of the judgment or order, but the trial court
may proceed upon any other matter embraced in the action and not affected by
the judgment or order”].)  Although this
issue has not been fully briefed, and it is not clear whether Defendants’
filing of the appeal from the May 9, 2024 order in the probate action stays
this action, the court finds that the interests of justice and judicial
efficiency support staying this action and therefore orders that this action is
stayed pending completion of Defendants’ appeal of the Probate Court’s order
granting Plaintiff’s motion to enforce the parties’ settlement agreement.  (Freiberg v. City of Mission Viejo (1995)
33 Cal.App.4th 1484, 1489 [“Trial courts generally have the inherent power to
stay proceedings in the interests of justice and to promote judicial
efficiency”].)[2]
 
 
ORDER
            The court orders that this
action is stayed pending completion of defendants Keiko Hasegawa, as an
individual and as personal representative of the Estate of Mulyadi T.S.
Sentoso, and Philip Sentoso, as personal representative of the Estate of
Mulyadi T.S. Sentoso’s appeal of the May 9, 2024 order granting the motion to
enforce settlement in the probate case Estate of Mulyadi Tirto Susielo
Sentoso (Case No. 20STPB02178). 
            The court orders that the hearing on
defendants Keiko Hasegawa, as an individual and as personal representative of
the Estate of Mulyadi T.S. Sentoso, and Philip Sentoso, as personal
representative of the Estate of Mulyadi T.S. Sentoso’s motion for summary
judgment or, in the alternative, summary adjudication is taken off calendar,
subject to being rescheduled if the stay is lifted. 
            The court orders that the Final
Status Conference, scheduled for August 16, 2024, and trial, scheduled for
August 28, 2024, are vacated.
            The court orders plaintiff Haryati
T.S. Sentoso to file a Notice of Settlement of Entire Case (Judicial Council
form CM-200) no later than August 1, 2024. 
 
            The court sets a Status
Conference re (1) Status of Appeal from the Probate Court’s May 9, 2024 Order
Granting Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement, and (2) Entry of Judgment or
Dismissal Pursuant to the Parties’ Settlement Agreement for hearing on February
4, 2025, at 8:30 a.m., in Department 53. 
            The court orders defendants
Keiko Hasegawa, as an individual and as personal representative of the Estate
of Mulyadi T.S. Sentoso, and Philip Sentoso, as personal representative of the
Estate of Mulyadi T.S. Sentoso to give notice of this ruling.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
