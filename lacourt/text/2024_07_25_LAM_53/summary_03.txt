And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to vacate the default and default judgment against the defendant. The plaintiff, Equitable Plaza, LLC, had filed a complaint against the defendant, Last Management, LLC, and had obtained a default judgment for possession. However, the plaintiff later filed a request to dismiss the action without prejudice and the clerk entered the dismissal. The plaintiff now seeks to vacate the default and default judgment, citing a new lease amendment between the parties. The judge has denied the motion, finding that the court's jurisdiction over the action terminated when the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the action and that there is no authority establishing that the court has jurisdiction over the action or that it may vacate the default and default judgment.
