And here is the English text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion to quash service of summons and cross-complaint filed by Plaintiff/Cross-Defendant Arman Solimani. The motion was denied because the proof of service filed on April 6, 2023, shows that Plaintiff was properly served with the cross-complaint by mail to his attorney. Additionally, Plaintiff has already appeared in the action and therefore cannot claim lack of personal jurisdiction. The judge also notes that Plaintiff's counsel has made false statements about the assigned judge's disqualification, which is a violation of the Professional Rules of Conduct. The judge orders Plaintiff's counsel to discontinue making these misrepresentations. Plaintiff is ordered to file a responsive pleading within 15 days of entry of this order.
