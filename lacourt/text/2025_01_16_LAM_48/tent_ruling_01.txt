[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING IN PART MOTION
  TO STAY; CONTINUING OSC
 
Dept. 48
8:30 a.m.
January 16, 2025



 
On October 20, 2023, Petitioner
California Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Safety and
Health filed a Petition to compel compliance with administrative subpoena.
On
June 20, 2024, the Court granted the Petition and ordered Respondent to produce
the requested documents within 30 days.  Respondent
appealed.
Respondent
did not appear at the October 18, 2024 Order to Show Cause Re: Respondent’s Failure
to Comply with Administrative Subpoena.
At
the continued OSC on December 10, 2024, the Court again continued the OSC and ordered
supplemental briefing on Petitioner’s Ex Parte Application for Issuance of Citation
and Order to Show Cause re Contempt.
On
December 20, 2024, Respondent filed a motion to stay this action.
MOTION
TO STAY
Respondent
seeks a stay of this case pending appeal. 
Respondent argues that it “faces contempt, infringement of its Fourth Amendment
protections, and [Respondent] will have needlessly opened its books to Petitioner”
without a stay.  (Motion at p. 11.)  According to Respondent, “The documents subject
to the Compelling Order include privilege information, such as proprietary information,
trade secrets, and personal identifiable information of third parties.”  (Id. at p. 12, footnote omitted.)
Alternatively,
Respondent requests a temporary stay to allow it to file a petition for writ of
supersedeas.  (Motion at pp. 16-17; see California
Rules of Court, rule 8.824.)  Petitioner suggests
that the Court grant Respondent four additional weeks to comply with the June 20,
2024 order and petition for supersedeas. 
(Opposition at p. 17.)
The
motion is GRANTED IN PART.  This action is
STAYED through and including February 19, 2025.
The
Court will lift the stay on February 20, 2025. 
Before that date, Respondent must either fully comply with the June 20, 2024
production order or file a petition for writ of supersedeas.  If Respondent has done neither, the Court will
proceed with the Order to Show Cause Re: Respondent’s Failure to Comply with Administrative
Subpoena.
OSC
RE: CONTEMPT
Respondent’s
counsel asserts that they “mistakenly believed that the present civil action was
automatically stayed.  As such, Uber inadvertently
failed to appear for the October 18, 2024, Order to Show Cause hearing.  Thereafter, Uber was informed that a stay was
not automatic.”  (Motion, Tsui Decl. ¶ 10.)
In
its opposition to Respondent’s motion for stay, Petitioner states that it “does
not seek a contempt citation at this time in [light] of Respondent’s assertion that
it did not realize until on or after October 18, 2024 that its appeal did not automatically
stay enforcement of the order.”  (Opposition
at p. 11.)  Petitioner concedes, “If Respondent
only recently realized that filing an appeal did not automatically stay enforcement
of the order, then a contempt citation at this time might be considered premature.”  (Id. at p. 12.)
With
Court’s grant of a temporary stay, the Order to Show Cause Re: Respondent’s Failure
to Comply with Administrative Subpoena is CONTINUED to February 20, 2025 at 8:30
a.m.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
in the case submit on the tentative ruling, no appearances before the Court are
required unless a companion hearing (for example, a Case Management Conference)
is also on calendar.
