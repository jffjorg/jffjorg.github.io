On October 11, 2024, Petitioner
Stris & Maher LLP filed an Amended Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award.
A
party may petition the court to confirm, correct, or vacate an arbitration award,
and a response to a petition may request that the court dismiss the petition or
confirm, correct, or vacate the award.  (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 1285, 1285.2.)  The petition
or response must set forth (1) the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement
to arbitrate, (2) the names of the arbitrators, and (3) the award and the written
opinion of the arbitrators, or attach a copy. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1285.4, 1285.6.) 
The court must either confirm the award as made, correct the award and confirm
it as corrected, vacate the award, or dismiss the proceeding.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.)
The
Amended Petition complies with Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4.  It includes a copy of the arbitration agreement
with each Respondent.  (Amended Petition,
Exs. A-B.)  Stephen C. Drummy served as the
sole arbitrator.  A copy of the arbitration
award is attached to the petition.  (Amended
Petition,  Ex. C.)  
The
unopposed Amended Petition is GRANTED.  The
Court will entered a judgment consistent with the arbitration award: in favor of
Stris & Maher LLP and against Tony Diab and Daniel S. March, jointly and severally,
for $384,706.39 in contract damages; interest at a rate of 10% per annum on the
contract damages beginning February 17, 2023; attorneys’ fees of $8,440.00; and
costs of $7,210.50.
Petitioner
is ordered to submit a proposed judgment within five days.
Moving
party to give notice.
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at SMCDEPT48@lacourt.org
indicating intention to submit.  If all parties
