And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Respondent's motion to stay the action pending appeal, but only in part. The action is stayed until February 19, 2025, after which Respondent must either fully comply with the June 20, 2024 production order or file a petition for writ of supersedeas. If Respondent has not done either of these things, the court will proceed with the Order to Show Cause Re: Respondent's Failure to Comply with Administrative Subpoena. The judge has also continued the Order to Show Cause until February 20, 2025. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to submit, and if all parties submit, no appearances before the court are required unless a companion hearing is also on calendar.
