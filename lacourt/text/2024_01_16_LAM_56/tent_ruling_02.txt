AND
RELATED CROSS ACTIONS
 
MOVING
PARTY: Defendant Dal-Tile Distribution, LLC (“Moving Defendant”)
            
            The Court has considered the moving
papers.  No opposition papers were
filed.  Any opposition papers were
required to have been filed and served at least nine court days before the
hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005,
subdivision (b). 
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises out of alleged
injuries caused by exposure to hazardous materials.  On October 12, 2023, the Court sustained four
demurrers and motions to strike that challenged the sufficiency of the
allegations of the first amended complaint (the “FAC”).  The Court’s October 12, 2023 order granted
Plaintiffs 20 days leave to amend. 
Plaintiffs did not file an amended pleading within 20 days of the
October 12, 2023 order.
 
            Plaintiffs attempted to file a second amended complaint
(the “SAC”) on November 21, 2023.  The
SAC was rejected due to Plaintiffs’ failure to seek leave to amend.  Plaintiffs’ second attempted to file the SAC
on December 8, 2023 was rejected for the same reason. 
 
On
December 8, 2023, Moving Defendant filed a motion to strike portions of the SAC
(the “Motion”).  Because the SAC was
never accepted as the operative pleading, the Motion is MOOT and is taken off
calendar. 
 
Moving party
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the department does not receive an email
and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off
calendar. 
 
  Dated
this 16th day of January 2024
