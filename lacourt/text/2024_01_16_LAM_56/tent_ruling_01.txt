  CASE NO.: 20STCV22869
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: 
MOTION TO SET ASIDE/VACATE DISMISSAL
 
Date: January 16, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
 



 
MOVING
PARTY: Plaintiffs
 
            The Court has considered the moving papers.  No opposition papers were filed.  Any opposition papers were required to have
been filed and served at least nine court days before the hearing under
California Code of Civil Procedure (“CCP”) section 1005, subdivision
(b).
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises out of a landlord/tenant relationship.  Plaintiffs’ complaint (the “Complaint”)
alleges: (1) failure to provide habitable dwelling; (2) breach of covenant of right
to quiet enjoyment and possession of the property; (3) nuisance; (4)
negligence; and (5) violation of Civil Code section 1942.4.
 
 
On April 7, 2023, the Court dismissed the Complaint
due to Plaintiffs’ failure to file a status report.  On August 24, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a motion
to vacate the dismissal pursuant to CCP section 473, subdivision (b) (the
“Motion”). 
 
DISCUSSION
The
court is empowered to relieve a party or their legal representative from a
judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against them through
their mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect.  (CCP § 473, subd. (b).)  The court shall,
whenever an application for relief is made no more than six months after entry
of judgment, is in proper form, and is accompanied by an attorney's sworn
affidavit attesting to his or her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect,
vacate any: (1) resulting default entered by the
clerk against his or her client, and which will result in entry of a default
judgment;
or
(2) resulting default judgment or dismissal entered against his or her client,
unless the court finds that the default or dismissal was not in fact caused by
the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.  (Id.)  The law favors a trial on the merits and courts
therefore liberally construe section 473.  (Bonzer v. City of
Huntington Park (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 1474, 1477.)  Doubts in
applying section 473 are resolved in favor of the party seeking relief
from default.  (Id. at 1478.)  
 
            In support of the Motion, Plaintiffs provides evidence that
their attorney failed to timely file a status report due to a calendaring
error.  (See Declaration of Chandra
Gehri Spencer ¶¶ 9-11.)  
 
 
The
Court finds that Plaintiffs have shown that the dismissal of the Complaint was
the result of their counsel’s mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect.  For this reason and because it is unopposed,
the Court GRANTS the Motion and orders that the dismissal be vacated and that the
Complaint be reinstated.  (Sexton v.
Superior Court (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410.)  The Court will hold a case management
conference on February 7, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. in this department.
 
            Moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at

website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
 
        Dated this 16th day of January 2024
