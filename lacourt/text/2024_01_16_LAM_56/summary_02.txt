And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling is regarding a motion to strike portions of the second amended complaint (SAC) filed by Dal-Tile Distribution, LLC (Moving Defendant). The Court has considered the moving papers, but no opposition papers were filed. The Court sustains the Motion, ruling that it is MOOT and taking it off calendar. The Court notes that Plaintiffs did not file an amended pleading within 20 days of the October 12, 2023 order, and their subsequent attempts to file the SAC were rejected due to failure to seek leave to amend. The parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court, and if no email is received and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar. The Court orders the Moving Party to give notice of this ruling.
