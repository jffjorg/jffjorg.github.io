And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to set aside/vacate the dismissal of the complaint filed by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs' complaint alleged various causes of action against the defendants, including failure to provide a habitable dwelling, breach of covenant of right to quiet enjoyment and possession, nuisance, negligence, and violation of Civil Code section 1942.4. The complaint was dismissed due to the plaintiffs' failure to file a status report. However, the plaintiffs have filed a motion to vacate the dismissal, claiming that their attorney's calendaring error was the cause of the failure to file the status report.

The court finds that the dismissal of the complaint was the result of the plaintiffs' counsel's mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect. Therefore, the court grants the motion and orders that the dismissal be vacated and that the complaint be reinstated. The court will hold a case management conference on February 7, 2024, to schedule further proceedings.
