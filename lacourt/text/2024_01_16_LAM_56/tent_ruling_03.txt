  CASE NO.: 23STCV03957
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER RE: MOTION TO BE
  RELIEVED AS COUNSEL
 
Date: 
  January 16, 2024
Time: 8:30 a.m.
Dept. 56
Jury Trial: August 19, 2024
 



 
MOVING PARTY: Tung & Associates, APLC
(“T&A”)
 
The Court has considered the moving papers.  No opposition papers were filed.  Any opposition papers
were required to have been filed and served at least nine court days before the
hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1005,
subdivision (b).
 
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff’s complaint (the “Complaint”) alleges 15
causes of action that arise out of an employment relationship. 
 
On
December 11, 2023, T&A filed a motion to be relieved as Plaintiff’s counsel
(the “Motion”).  The Motion is not in the
format required by California Rules of
Court, rule 3.1362. The Court therefore DENIES the Motion without
prejudice. 
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
 
Parties who intend to submit on this
tentative must send an email to the Court at SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed
by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org.  If
the department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar. 
 
           Dated this 16th day of January 2024
