## English Text Summary

The Judge has tentatively ruled to deny Plaintiff Northern California Collection Service, Inc.'s request for a default judgment against Defendant Iman Trucking, Inc. The reason for the denial is that Plaintiff used the incorrect form for requesting the default judgment. 

Specifically, the Judge points out that debt collection cases subject to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act require the use of a specific form (CIV-105). Plaintiff used a different form (CIV-100) which is generally used for other types of default judgments. 

The denial is "without prejudice," meaning Plaintiff can re-file their request using the correct form.
