**English Summary:**

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion by Plaintiff’s counsel, Connor M. Trafton, to be relieved from representing CA Flooring Wholesalers Inc. 

The judge found that the reasons provided by counsel for withdrawing were not sufficient. Specifically, the judge stated that simply seeking new counsel does not automatically justify withdrawal, especially when the attorney-client relationship is not demonstrably broken or hampered by the client's actions. Additionally, the judge noted that the forms filed in support of the motion were incomplete and defective, failing to provide necessary information and documentation.

Therefore, the motion is denied without prejudice, meaning counsel may refile it with corrected information and stronger supporting arguments.
