And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the motion of Plaintiff's Counsel to be relieved as counsel without prejudice. The motion was unopposed, but the court did not find sufficient grounds for permitting withdrawal. The court notes that the declaration and proposed order submitted by Counsel were incomplete and defective, and therefore, the court cannot grant the motion. The court orders Counsel to give notice of the ruling and file proof of service of same within five calendar days.
