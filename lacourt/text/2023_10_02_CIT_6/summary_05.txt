Summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Bin Yang v. Thomas Ton, et al. The case involves an automobile accident and the subsequent litigation. Plaintiff Bin Yang is seeking to hold Defendant Mercury Insurance Company liable for personal injury and bad faith insurance claims.

The Court has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the personal injury/negligence claim, meaning that the complaint does not adequately state a claim for personal injury against Defendant Mercury Insurance Company. The Court has also overruled the demurrer with respect to any bad faith insurance claim as moot since the Second Amended Complaint (SAC) does not allege a cause of action for bad faith insurance.

The Court has denied the motion to strike as moot, meaning that it is no longer necessary to strike portions of the complaint. Finally, the Court has ordered Defendant Mercury Insurance Company to give notice and provide proof of service of same within five calendar days of the Court's order.
