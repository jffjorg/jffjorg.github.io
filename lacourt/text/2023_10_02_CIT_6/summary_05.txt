Here is a summary in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling addresses a demurrer filed by Mercury Insurance Company and a motion to strike filed by the same defendant. The demurrer argues that the plaintiff's cause of action for personal injury/negligence fails to state a claim, and the motion to strike argues that certain portions of the complaint should be stricken.

The judge sustains the demurrer without leave to amend as to the personal injury/negligence claim, finding that the plaintiff has failed to allege facts showing that Mercury Insurance owed the plaintiff a duty. The judge also overrules the demurrer with respect to the purported bad faith insurance claim as moot, since the complaint does not allege a cause of action for bad faith insurance.

The judge denies the motion to strike as moot, finding that the issues raised by the motion are no longer relevant in light of the demurrer's outcome. The judge orders Mercury Insurance to provide proof of service of the order within five calendar days.

The case involves an automobile accident that occurred on January 31, 2020, and subsequent litigation. The plaintiff, Bin Yang, alleges that Mercury Insurance breached its duty to provide a replacement vehicle and engaged in bad faith insurance practices, leading to his alleged injuries, including two heart attacks and PTSD.
