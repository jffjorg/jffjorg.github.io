On January 31, 2020, Plaintiff Bin Yang was involved in an automobile accident with Defendant Thomas Ton (Ton). After Plaintiff filed a claim with Ton’s insurer, Defendant Mercury Insurance Company (Mercury Insurance), Plaintiff alleges Mercury Insurance determined Plaintiff’s vehicle was totaled and only allowed Plaintiff to rent a replacement vehicle for five days. As a result of Plaintiff’s dealings with Mercury Insurance, Plaintiff allegedly experienced two heart attacks and PTSD.On June 25, 2021, Plaintiff filed a personal injury action (Case No. 21STCV23749) against Ton and Mercury Insurance (collectively, Defendants). On June 29, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) in that action against the same Defendants alleging (1) personal injuries, (2) insurance fraud, and (3) manslaughter. Defendants both demurred to Plaintiff’s FAC.On October 7, 2021, the Court issued a minute order overruling Ton’s demurrer to the first cause of action, sustaining Ton’s demurrer to the second cause of action with 20 days leave to amend, and sustaining Ton’s demurrer to the third cause of action without leave to amend. The Court also sustained Mercury Insurance’s demurrer to the second cause of action with 20 days leave to amend while Mercury Insurance’s demurrer to the first and third causes of action were sustained without leave to amend. Last, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to strike punitive damages from the FAC without leave to amend. On October 18, 2021, Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration of the court’s rulings that was denied November 16, 2021. On December 14, 2021, Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal from the court’s rulings (Case No. B317215.)On December 21, 2021, Plaintiff filed a motion to recuse the judge in Plaintiff’s action. The next day, the Court struck Plaintiff’s motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 170.4. On January 7, 2022, Plaintiff filed an amended motion to recuse the same judge. On January 20, 2022, the Court struck the amended motion for the same reasons the initial motion was stricken. On July 25, 2022, Plaintiff filed another motion to recuse the same judge that was stricken on July 27, 2022. On August 11, 2022, Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal from the court’s order. (Case No. B322927.)On September 27, 2022, the Court of Appeal dismissed Plaintiff’s appeal in Case No. B317215 on the grounds that the November 16, 2021 order was not appealable. On December 30, 2022, the Court of Appeal’s order became final.On November 23, 2022, Ton filed a motion for terminating sanctions against Plaintiff with a hearing on the motion set for January 23, 2023. On January 12, 2023, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the entire action without prejudice.On January 26, 2023, Plaintiff refiled the present action against the same Defendants, alleging the following causes of action: (1) personal injuries, (2) insurance fraud, (3) manslaughter, (4) first degree attempted murder, and (5) first degree attempted murder. On February 2, 2023, the Court of Appeal determined Plaintiff was in default and dismissed Plaintiffs appeal in Case No. B322927. The Court of Appeal’s order became final on April 5, 2023.On April 19, 2023, the Court sustained Ton’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s Complaint without leave to amend. The Court also sustained Mercury Insurance’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s second, third, fourth, and fifth causes of action without leave to amend. While the Court had posted a tentative ruling that sustained Mercury Insurance’s demurrer to Plaintiff’s first cause of action for personal injury without leave to amend, the Court declined to adopt the tentative in this regard and instead sustained the demurrer with twenty days’ leave to amend.On May 10, 2023, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint (FAC) against the same Defendants alleging (1) personal injury and (2) insurance bad faith. Mercury Insurance subsequently demurred, and on July 3, 2023, the Court sustained the demurrer with ten days’ leave to amend as to Plaintiff’s first cause of action for personal injury/negligence. On its own motion, the Court also struck the allegations as to Defendant Ton and the inclusion of the second cause of action for bad faith insurance on the grounds that they violated the Court’s April 19, 2023 order.On July 13, 2023, Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended Complaint (SAC) against Defendant Mercury Insurance. On August 15, 2023, Mercury Insurance filed the instant demurrer and motion to strike to the SAC.[1] On August 29, 2023, Plaintiff opposed the demurrer and motion to strike. On September 25, 2023, Mercury Insurance replied to both oppositions.LEGAL STANDARD - DemurrerA demurrer is a pleading used to test the legal sufficiency of other pleadings. It raises issues of law, not fact, regarding the form or content of the opposing party's pleading (complaint, answer or cross-complaint). (Code Civ. Proc., § 422.10; see Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) It is not the function of the demurrer to challenge the truthfulness of the complaint; and for purposes of ruling on the demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true. (Id.)A demurrer can be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially noticeable. (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian, supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at p. 994.) No other extrinsic evidence can be considered. (Ion Equip. Corp. v. Nelson (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 868, 881 [error for court to consider facts asserted in memorandum supporting demurrer]; see also Afuso v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 859, 862 [disapproved on other grounds in Moradi-Shalal v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Cos. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 287] [error to consider contents of release not part of court record].)A demurrer can be utilized where the “face of the complaint” itself is incomplete or discloses some defense that would bar recovery. (Guardian North Bay, Inc. v. Superior Court (2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 963, 971-972.) The “face of the complaint” includes material contained in attached exhibits that are incorporated by reference into the complaint; or in a superseded complaint in the same action. (Frantz v. Blackwell (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 91, 94; see also Barnett v. Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. (2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 500, 505 [“[W]e rely on and accept as true the contents of the exhibits and treat as surplusage the pleader’s allegations as to the legal effect of the exhibits.”])A demurrer can only be sustained when it disposes of an entire cause of action. (Poizner v. Fremont General Corp. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 97, 119; Kong v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redev. Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 1028, 1046.)REQUESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOTICEThe Court GRANTS Mercury Insurance’s request for judicial notice as to Exhibits A. (Evid. Code § 452, subd. (d).) However, the Court takes judicial notice of the foregoing documents only as to “the existence, content and authenticity of public records and other specified documents”; it does not take judicial notice of the truth of the factual matters asserted in those documents. (Dominguez v. Bonta (2022) 87 Cal. App. 5th 389, 400.)DISCUSSION – DemurrerMeet and ConferPer Code of Civil Procedure section 430.41, subdivision (a), Defendant was required to meet and confer before bringing this demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.41, subd. (a).) The Court finds Defendant’s efforts to meet and confer sufficient. (Rousier Decl., ¶¶ 3-9.)AnalysisMercury Insurance demurs to Plaintiff’s purported[2] causes of action for personal injury/negligence and bad faith insurance for failure to state a cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd. (e).)Personal Injury/NegligenceTo state a claim for personal injury or negligence, the plaintiff must allege facts showing that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty, the defendant breached that duty, the defendant’s breach was the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injuries, and the plaintiff suffered damages as a result. (Peredia v. H.R. Mobile Services, Inc. (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 680, 687, internal citation omitted.)Mercury Insurance demurs to Plaintiff’s cause of action for personal injury/negligence on the grounds that Defendant owed no duty to Plaintiff. Mercury Insurance contends it is not liable to Plaintiff merely because it was Defendant Ton’s insurer in connection with the underlying accident. The Court agrees.Mercury Insurance’s status as the insurer of Defendant Ton in connection with the underlying accident does not support a cause of action for personal injury against Mercury Insurance. “‘[G]enerally an insurer may not be joined as a party-defendant in the underlying action against the insured by the injured third party. The fact that an insurer has agreed to indemnify the insured for any judgment rendered in the action does not make the insurer a proper party. Liability insurance is not a contract for the benefit of the injured party so as to allow it to sue the insurer directly.’ [Citation.]” (Royal Indem. Co. v. United Enterprises, Inc. (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 194, 205.) The SAC also contains no other allegations that Mercury Insurance was the owner or driver of the vehicle at the time of the underlying accident, or otherwise owed Plaintiff a duty in connection with this matter.The alleged injuries Plaintiff complains of throughout the SAC appear to be based solely on how Mercury Insurance handled the processing of Plaintiff’s claim against Defendant Ton. (See, e.g., SAC, 4:22-8:13.) Plaintiff has cited to no legal authorities in her opposition which evidence that an insurer’s handling of an injured third-party’s claim against one of its insureds supports a cause of action for personal injury against the insurer. As for the additional allegations the SAC contains regarding stress-induced heart problems amongst other things, those are irrelevant to Plaintiff’s personal injury claim. As explained above, Plaintiff has failed to allege facts showing that Mercury Insurance owed Plaintiff a duty here. Plaintiff’s opposition otherwise largely repeats allegations from the SAC.Therefore, the Court SUSTAINS the demurrer without leave to amend as to Plaintiff’s cause of action personal injury/negligence.Bad Faith“[T]o establish the insurer's ‘bad faith’ liability, the insured must show that the insurer has (1) withheld benefits due under the policy, and (2) that such withholding was ‘unreasonable’ or ‘without proper cause.’ [Citation.] The actionable withholding of benefits may consist of the denial of benefits due [citation]; paying less than due [citation]; and/or unreasonably delaying payments due [citation].” (Major v. W. Home Ins. Co. (2009) 169 Cal.App.4th 1197, 1209.)Defendant also contends that Plaintiff’s cause of action for bad faith insurance should be denied since the Court already denied Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend the Second Amended Complaint to add a cause of action for bad faith insurance. (Minute Order (8/8/2023.))[3] The Court disagrees, but only to the extent that the SAC does not allege a cause of action for bad faith insurance. (See Id. [“On July 13, 2023, Plaintiff [filed] a Second Amended Complaint (SAC) against Mercury Insurance alleging a single cause of action for personal injury.”]) Admittedly, the allegations throughout the SAC are unclear and could potentially be construed as alleging a bad faith insurance claim; however, if Plaintiff had been alleging a bad faith insurance claim, she would have had no need to seek leave to amend the SAC to add such a claim. (See Id., generally.) If Plaintiff were attempting to allege such a claim in the SAC, the Court agrees with Defendant that it would be denied for the same reasons set forth in the Court’s August 8, 2023 order, namely that Plaintiff does not allege in the SAC that she was an insured of Mercury Insurance. (See SAC, generally; Major, supra, 169 Cal.App.4th at p. 1209.) The Court also agrees that a cause of action for bad faith insurance would be barred by the Court’s April 19, 2023 order, which sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to that cause of action. (Minute Order (4/19/2023).)Therefore, the Court OVERRULES the demurrer with respect to any bad faith insurance claim as moot. To be clear, this does not mean Plaintiff’s SAC survives. The only cause of action alleged in the SAC was for personal injury/negligence. Since the Court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, there are no causes of action remaining in the SAC.LEGAL STANDARD – Motion to Strike“Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof, but this time limitation shall not apply to motions specified in subdivision (e).” (Code Civ. Proc., § 435, subd. (b)(2).) “The court may, upon a motion made pursuant to Section 435, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper: (a) Strike out any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (b) Strike out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court.” (Id., § 436.)DISCUSSION – Motion to StrikeMeet and ConferPer Code of Civil Procedure section 435.5, subdivision (a), Defendant was required to meet and confer before bringing this motion to strike. (Code Civ. Proc., § 435.5, subd. (a).) The Court finds Defendant’s efforts to meet and confer sufficient. (Rousier Decl., ¶¶ 3-9.)AnalysisIn light of the Court sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend, the Court denies the motion to strike as moot.CONCLUSIONThe Court SUSTAINS the demurrer without leave to amend as to the personal injury/negligence claim. The demurrer is OVERRULED with respect the purported bad faith insurance claim as moot since the SAC does not allege a cause of action for bad faith insurance.The Court DENIES the motion to strike as moot.Mercury Insurance is ordered to give notice and provide proof of service of same within five calendar days of the Court’s order.[1] Mercury Insurance also filed a motion to strike on August 14, 2023. The Court infers that Mercury Insurance did so because the hearing date and courtroom information on the August 14, 2023 version appear to have listed the wrong date and wrong courtroom information. Thus, any references to the motion to strike herein refer to the August 15, 2023 version.[2] Mercury Insurance’s demurrer notes that the SAC does not allege any specific or recognized causes of action against Mercury Insurance. Based on the prior iterations of the complaint alleging causes of action for personal injury and the Court’s July 3, 2023 order specifying that Plaintiff’s leave to amend is limited to a cause of action for personal injury against Mercury Insurance, the Court agrees with Mercury Insurance’s assessment and will construe Plaintiff’s allegations as those for personal injury.[3] The Court may take judicial notice of its own records.
