And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to compel arbitration in this lemon law case. The defendant, Nissan North America, Inc., argued that a valid arbitration agreement existed between the plaintiff, Mary Lu Romero, and a third-party dealer, and that this agreement covered the dispute between the parties. However, the judge found that the defendant had failed to establish the existence of a valid arbitration agreement that covers the dispute.

The judge also rejected the defendant's equitable estoppel theory, which argued that the plaintiff was estopped from refusing to arbitrate their claims against the defendant. The judge noted that recent cases have rejected this theory and that the defendant had failed to show that the plaintiff's claims arise out of the contract or are intimately connected with the underlying contract obligations.

Finally, the judge rejected the defendant's third-party beneficiary theory, which argued that the defendant was a third-party beneficiary of the arbitration agreement. The judge found that the defendant had failed to show that the parties to the contract intended to benefit the defendant, and that permitting the defendant to enforce the arbitration clause would not effectuate the objectives of the contract.

The judge ordered the defendant to give notice of the ruling within five calendar days of the order.
