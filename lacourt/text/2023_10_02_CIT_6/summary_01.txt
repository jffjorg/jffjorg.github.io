summary\_text:
This is a tentative ruling for the case Troy Trang, et al. v. CC Royal Services, Inc., et al. with case number 18PSCV00192, scheduled for hearing on October 2, 2023 in Dept 6. The court denies the motion for summary judgment on the third amended complaint and the motion for summary adjudication on the first amended cross-complaint. Defendant Wang is ordered to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days of this order. This is a personal property dispute involving the sale of real estate and personal property at 2829 Wagon Train Lane, Diamond Bar, CA 91765. The plaintiffs, Troy Trang and Ling Yin, filed the action on December 29, 2018, and the third amended complaint on September 12, 2019, alleging one cause of action for conversion against defendant Shu Wang and Does 1 through 10. Defendant Wang filed a cross-complaint on December 11, 2019, and the first amended cross-complaint on February 6, 2020, alleging causes of action for breach of contract, conversion, intentional misrepresentation, and false promise against the plaintiffs and Yan Hsing Lin. The plaintiffs filed the motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication on June 12, 2023, which were opposed by Wang on September 18, 2023, and replied by the plaintiffs on September 27, 2023. The trial is scheduled for November 14, 2023. The legal standard for a motion for summary judgment is set by CCP § 437c(c), which requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues, and the function of the affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.
