Summary of the Tentative Ruling:

The Court has granted the Plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint (FAC) in this personal injury action. The Plaintiffs are the surviving parents and partner of Decedent Alex Christopher Villeda. The Defendant's demurrer to the Complaint was overruled in part and sustained in part, and the Plaintiffs were granted leave to amend the Complaint by July 1, 2024. However, the Plaintiffs failed to file the amended Complaint within the deadline and sought to file a new request for leave to amend. The Defendant argued that the purported agreement to extend the deadline to file the FAC was not valid and that the Plaintiffs failed to comply with the requirements of CRC Rule 3.1324. The Court found that the Plaintiffs had substantially complied with the rule and granted the motion for leave to file the FAC. The Plaintiffs are ordered to file and serve the FAC within 5 days.
