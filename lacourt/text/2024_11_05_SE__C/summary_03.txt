And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion of Counsel Thomas D. Sands and The Sands Law Group to withdraw as counsel for Defendant Retail Ecommerce Ventures, LLC. The motion was unopposed and was based on the fact that the client has ceased all communication with counsel, making it impossible for counsel to effectively represent the defendant. The judge found that good cause exists for the withdrawal based on the grounds set forth in California Rules of Court, rule 3-700(C). The motion was supported by a declaration from counsel stating the reasons for withdrawal and proof of service of the notice of motion and motion on the client and other parties.
