And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer is sustained with respect to all causes of action brought by the plaintiff. The plaintiff had alleged causes of action for wrongful eviction, trespass, intentional infliction of emotional distress, violation of Business and Profession Code § 17200, intentional misrepresentation, intentional interference with use of commercial premises, and breach of contract and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

The court has determined that the plaintiff's claims are barred by collateral estoppel, as the issue of service of the three-day notice was litigated in an earlier unlawful detainer action. The defendant's conduct was not outrageous or fraudulent, and the plaintiff's claims of emotional distress are not supported.

The court has also determined that the plaintiff's claims of intentional misrepresentation are not specifically pled and are therefore sustained with 20 days leave to amend.
