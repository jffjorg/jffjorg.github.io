```

Summary:

The tentative ruling addresses the demurrers filed by the defendants, JT Legal Group and Crestview Solutions, Inc. The court finds that the contract between the plaintiff, Eric Garcia, and JT Legal Group is not illegal and that Garcia is not in pari delicto with JT Legal Group. The court also finds that Crestview Solutions, Inc. is not liable for the plaintiff's claims, except for the claim for breach of implied contract, which is left to be determined as a question of fact. The court sustains Crestview's demurrer as to the third through sixth and eighth causes of action, with leave to amend.
