  Case No.:  22STCV19827
  Hearing Date:  May 20, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
Plaintiff’s motion to quash or modify
  subpoenas 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On June 17, 2022, Plaintiff Latina
Young initiated this action against Defendant Nancy Watson. The Court
previously sustained Defendant’s demurrers to the original complaint and First
Amended Complaint, finding that the pleadings failed to plead sufficient facts
and were uncertain. Plaintiff filed the operative Second Amended Complaint on
February 21, 2023, alleging (1) breach of contract, (2) general negligence, (3)
intentional tort, and (4) premises liability. On April 28, 2023, the Court
sustained Defendant’s demurrer without leave to amend as to every cause of
action except premises liability. Plaintiff’s remaining claim is based on
allegations that Defendant knowingly allowed Plaintiff to be sexually assaulted
by other tenants.   
            On March 29, April 5, and April 12,
2024, Plaintiff filed a total of 18 motions to quash or modify subpoenas issued
to her medical providers. The motions were initially scheduled to be heard on
dates ranging from April 22, 2024 to May 17, 2024. At the hearing on April 22,
2024, the Court continued all 18 motions to May 20, 2024 and limited the
briefing to one opposition and one reply. Defendant filed her opposition on May
7, 2024. Plaintiff has not filed a reply.
LEGAL STANDARD
 “If
a subpoena requires the attendance of a witness or the production of books,
documents, electronically stored information, or other things …, the court,
upon motion reasonably made by [a party] . . . may make an order quashing the
subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon those
terms or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective orders.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (a), (b).) Good cause must be shown to compel
a nonparty to produce documents. (See Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v.
Superior Court (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 216, 224.)   
DISCUSSION
The subpoenas seek all medical records
pertaining to Plaintiff from the first date of treatment to present. Plaintiff
argues that the requests are overbroad and that the documents are protected by
privacy and the physician-patient privilege. Plaintiff seeks to limit the
records to one day. 
“The party asserting a privacy right must
establish a legally protected privacy interest, an objectively reasonable
expectation of privacy in the given circumstances, and a threatened intrusion
that is serious.” (Williams v. Sup. Ct. (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 552.) If
the court finds a privacy interest, the court must balance the privacy concerns
against the need for the information. (Id. at p. 552.) Discovery of
private information is governed by the more stringent standard of direct
relevance in order to prevent a fishing expedition of “tangentially pertinent
sensitive information.” (Boler v. Sup. Ct. (1987) 201 Cal.App.3d 467,
472.) “The burden is on the party seeking the constitutionally protected
information to establish direct relevance.” (Davis v. Superior Court
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1008, 1017.) 
“A plaintiff who puts his or her medical
condition in issue thereby waives his or her privilege against discovery of the
medical information by the defendant.” (Oiye v. Fox (2012) 211
Cal.App.4th 1036, 1043.) The physician-patient privilege is similarly waived if
a plaintiff places her medical condition at issue. (Id. at p. 1068.) Here,
Plaintiff has placed her medical condition at issue by claiming a broad range
of injuries, including “[h]air removed, traumatic brain injury, back, stomach,
right knee, private area (front and back) and more conditions still pending
such as cervical cancer.” (Reagan Decl., Ex. A, FROG No. 6.2.) Therefore,
Plaintiff has waived the right to keep pertinent records confidential, as well
as the physician-patient privilege. 
By attributing injuries to Defendant’s
conduct, Plaintiff has entitled Defendant to obtain evidence disproving the
nature, extent, and cause of those injuries. Thus, Defendant has established
the direct relevance of the requested documents, and Defendant’s interest in
disclosure outweighs Plaintiff’s privacy interest. The breadth of the subpoenas
is justified by the breadth of Plaintiff’s claimed injuries. Defendant is
entitled to obtain evidence of alternative causes of Plaintiff’s alleged
injuries. Records from before and after the alleged assaults are directly
relevant to Plaintiff’s allegations of developing and continuous injuries. 
Defendant agrees that medical records
related to the birth of Plaintiff’s children are unrelated to this action. (Opp.
7:17-21.) Defendant is willing to modify the subpoenas to exclude the dates of
birth of the plaintiff’s children. (Ibid.) The remaining records are
directly relevant for the reasons articulated above.   
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motions to quash or
modify subpoenas are DENIED. Records pertaining to the birth of Plaintiff’s
children shall be excluded from the production.
