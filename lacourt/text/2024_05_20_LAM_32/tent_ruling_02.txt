     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant children’s hospital of los
  angeles’ motion to deem matters admitted 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On May 27, 2022, Plaintiffs filed
this medical malpractice action on behalf of their deceased son, who died after
several MRI scans. Plaintiffs allege that Decedent was improperly exposed to
the chemical gadolinium throughout the course of the MRIs, resulting in severe
burns, health complications, and eventually death. Plaintiffs allege that
Decedent had a history of hypersensitivity to gadolinium and that Defendants
were put on notice of Decedent’s condition and should have been aware of the
risks of gadolinium exposure in children. The complaint alleges causes of
action for (1) medical malpractice, (2) medical malpractice-lack of informed
consent, (3) medical battery, and (4) a survival action. 
            On April 17, 2024, Defendant
Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles filed the instant motion to deem matters
admitted in its Requests for Admission, Set Three.  
LEGAL STANDARD 
Responses to requests for admission are
due thirty days after service of the requests. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.250(a).) If a party fails to timely respond to RFAs, the propounding party
may move to deem the matters admitted. (Id., § 2033.280(b).) The motion
must be granted unless the responding party serves substantially compliant
responses before the hearing on the motion. (Id., subd. (c).) 
DISCUSSION
            Defendant propounded the subject
RFAs on March 11, 2024. (Kjar Decl. ¶ 2.) Plaintiffs did not respond by the
deadline of April 15, 2024 and have not provided any responses to date. (Id.,
¶¶ 3-4.) Therefore, the matters must be deemed admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2033.250(c).) 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant CHLA’s motion to deem
matters admitted is GRANTED.
