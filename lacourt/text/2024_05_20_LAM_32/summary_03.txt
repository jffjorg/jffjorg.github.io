And here is the English text summarizing the Judge's tentative ruling:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff's motion to quash or modify subpoenas. The Plaintiff, Latina Young, has filed 18 motions to quash or modify subpoenas issued to her medical providers. The Judge has denied these motions, except for excluding medical records related to the birth of Plaintiff's children. The Plaintiff has placed her medical condition at issue by claiming a broad range of injuries, including hair removal, traumatic brain injury, and back, stomach, and knee injuries. The Judge has ruled that the Plaintiff has waived her right to keep pertinent records confidential and has waived the physician-patient privilege. The Defendant, Nancy Watson, has established the direct relevance of the requested documents and has shown that the breadth of the subpoenas is justified by the breadth of Plaintiff's claimed injuries. The Judge has ordered that the Defendant may obtain evidence of alternative causes of Plaintiff's alleged injuries and has ruled that the Defendant's interest in disclosure outweighs the Plaintiff's privacy interest.
