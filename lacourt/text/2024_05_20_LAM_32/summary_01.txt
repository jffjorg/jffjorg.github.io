And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling addresses the defendant's motion to tax costs claimed by the plaintiff. The court finds that the plaintiff's costs are reasonable and allows most of the claimed costs, except for travel and lodging expenses, which are stricken. The court concludes that the defendant's financial condition is not a relevant factor in determining the reasonableness of costs. The ruling notes that the plaintiff prevailed in the litigation and that the defendant failed to obtain a more favorable result at trial after rejecting the plaintiff's Section 998 offer. The court also finds that the witness fees, court reporter fees, and interpreter fees are reasonable.
