  order RE:
defendant georgia bode’s motion to tax
  costs 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On January 22, 2019, Plaintiffs
Antonio Leon and Blanca Leon filed this action against Defendants James Jaber,
MD, Georgia Bode, MD, and Los Angeles Community Hospital, asserting causes of
action for (1) medical malpractice and (2) loss of consortium. The First
Amended Complaint was filed on May 8, 2019. Blanca Leon’s claims were
dismissed, leaving Antonio Leon’s medical malpractice claim. 
            The matter came on for trial between
January 29, 2024 and February 9, 2024, after which the jury returned a verdict
for Plaintiff against Defendant Bode. Plaintiff was ordered to prepare a
judgment. Defendant objected to the proposed judgment, arguing that Plaintiff’s
Section 998 offer was invalid and that Plaintiff incorrectly calculated the
settlement offset. This led to a contested motion to enforce judgment, which
the Court ultimately granted on March 21, 2024. Judgment was entered the same
day in the total amount of $12,478,222.95. The judgment provided that costs
were to be determined by subsequent motion.   

            On April 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed
his Memorandum of Costs (MOC) totaling $120,489.50. On April 17, 2024,
Defendant filed the instant motion to tax costs. Plaintiff filed his opposition
on May 7, 2024. Defendant filed her reply on May 13, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
The statutory scheme for cost recovery
establishes three categories of trial preparation expenses: (1) one category
allowable as a matter of right to the prevailing party (Code Civ. Proc., §
1033.5(a)); (2) one category disallowable unless expressly authorized elsewhere
by law (id., subd. (b)); and (3) one category allowable or disallowable
in the court’s discretion (id., subd. (c)(4)). Even where costs are
deemed allowable, such costs are only recoverable to the extent that they are
(1) reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely
convenient or beneficial to its preparation and (2) reasonable in amount. (Id.,
subd. (c)(2)-(3).)
“If the items appearing in a cost bill
appear to be proper charges, the burden is on the party seeking to tax costs to
show that they were not reasonable or necessary. On the other hand, if the
items are properly objected to, they are put in issue and the burden of proof
is on the party claiming them as costs.” (Sanford v. Rasnick (2016) 246
Cal.App.4th 1121, 1128.) 
DISCUSSION
I.
Filing and Motion Fees (Item 1)
            Plaintiff’s MOC claims filing and
motion fees of $3,189.20. Defendant argues that “[s]uch fees should not be
allowed except for reasonable fees for responsive pleadings” and that Plaintiff
is not entitled to recover for certain motions which Defendant characterizes as
“Plaintiff’s unsuccessful motions for legal maneuvers.” 
            Plaintiff’s opposition attaches
receipts proving the filing and motion fees incurred. (Opp., Ex. A.) Defendant
cites no authority for the proposition that only responsive pleadings are
reasonably necessary to litigation, nor does Defendant specify which unsuccessful
legal maneuvers should be excluded, considering Plaintiff prevailed in the
litigation. The Court finds that the filing and motion fees are
reasonable.  
II.
Deposition Costs (Item 4)
            Plaintiff’s MOC claims deposition
costs of $12,012.60. Defendant argues that it would be unreasonable for her to
bear the costs of the depositions of her co-defendant, Dr. James Jaber, and
Plaintiff’s designated expert, Dr. Gloria Tancinco. Both Drs. Jaber and
Tancinco were pertinent witnesses whose testimony was reasonably necessary to
Plaintiff’s case against Defendant. The costs incurred are proven by receipts.
(Opp., Ex. B.) The Court finds that the deposition costs are reasonable.   
III.
Service of Process (Item 5)
            Plaintiff’s MOC claims services
costs of $7,168.09. Defendant argues that this includes costs for tracking and
service of other parties and therefore she should not bear those costs. The
service costs pertained to witnesses or parties that appeared at trial. The
amount is substantiated by receipts. (Opp., Ex. C.) The Court finds that the
service costs are reasonable.  
IV.
Witness Fees (Item 8)
            Plaintiff’s MOC claims witness fees
of $64,225. Defendant argues that the witness fees being claimed are for expert
witnesses not ordered by the court. “Fees of experts not ordered by the court”
are “not allowable as costs, except when expressly authorized by law.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(b)(1).) Code of Civil Procedure section 998(d) is a law
that expressly authorizes recovery of expert witness fees. Defendant failed to
obtain a more favorable result at trial after rejecting Plaintiff’s Section 998
offer. Therefore, Section 998 permits recovery of expert witness fees
notwithstanding Section 1033.5(b)(1). 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff has
provided no supporting documentation to verify the reasonableness of the fees. Plaintiff
provides invoices in his opposition. (Opp., Ex. D.) The Court finds that the witness
fees are reasonable. 
V.
Court Reporter Fees (Item 11)
            Plaintiff’s MOC claims court
reporter fees of $20,143.16. Defendant argues that no transcripts were ordered
by the Court. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5(b)(5) [“Transcripts of court
proceedings not ordered by the court” are “not allowable as costs”].) However, court
reporter fees are distinct from transcript fees and are not expressly
prohibited; thus, they are subject to the Court’s discretion. (See id.,
§ 1033.5(c)(4).) Plaintiff presents the invoice for the court reporter fees.
(Opp., Ex. F.) The Court finds that the court reporter fees are reasonable. 
VI.
Models, Enlargements, and Photocopies of Exhibits (Item 12)
            Plaintiff’s MOC claims costs of
$937.25 for models, enlargements, and photocopies of exhibits. Defendant argues
that these costs should be stricken because it cannot be determined which
exhibits were actually used at trial. However, costs for materials not used at
trial are recoverable in the Court’s discretion. (Segal v. ASICS America
Corp. (2022) 12 Cal.5th 651, 667.) The Court finds that the costs were
reasonably necessary to the litigation. (See Opp., Ex. E.)
VII.
Interpreter Fees (Item 13)
            Plaintiff’s MOC claims interpreter
fees of $5,720. Defendant argues that because the MOC is unaccompanied by
supporting documentation, the interpreter fees were not reasonably necessary to
the litigation. Plaintiff attaches the invoice to his opposition. (Opp., Ex.
G.) An interpreter was necessary to translate for Plaintiff. The Court finds
that the interpreter fees are reasonable. 
VIII.
Travel and Lodging Costs (Item 16)
            Plaintiff’s MOC claims $5,297.50 in
travel and lodging costs for witnesses and counsel. “Routine expenses for local
travel by attorneys or other firm employees are not reasonably necessary to the
conduct of litigation.” (Ladas v. California State Auto. Assn. (1993) 19
Cal.App.4th 761, 775-776.) Plaintiff does not address Ladas nor cite
evidence of the travel expenses incurred. (See Opp. 7:18-22.) Therefore, Item
16 is stricken. 
IX.
Defendant’s Financial Burden
            Lastly, Defendant argues that the
Court must take her financial condition into account, citing Seever v.
Copley Press, Inc. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1561-62 for the proposition
that a determination of reasonableness includes consideration of financial
resources. Seever discussed cost awards under Section 998, and the court
was concerned that “less affluent parties will be pressured into accepting
unreasonable offers just to avoid the risk of a financial penalty they can't
afford.” (Id. at p. 1562.) “Thus, when two competing parties possess
vastly disparate economic resources, this may require the trial courts to ‘scale’
the financial incentives (in this instance the section 998 cost awards) to the
parties’ respective resources.” (Ibid.) 
            There is no indication that this
case involves similar concerns over a less affluent party being pressured into
accepting an unreasonable settlement offer, nor any indication of vastly
different economic resources between the parties. In fact, Defendant presents
no evidence at all regarding her financial status. The mere fact that Plaintiff
won a substantial award at trial reveals nothing about Defendant’s ability to
pay. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s motion to tax costs is
GRANTED as to Item 16 (travel/lodging expenses) and DENIED in all other
respects. Plaintiff’s MOC is taxed in the amount of $5,297.50.
