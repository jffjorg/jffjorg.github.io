And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion of Attorney Mike M. Khalilpour, representing Defendant Modern Stone, Inc., to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed due to the lack of cooperation from the Defendant, which has hindered the ability to prosecute the case. The judge found that there is an extreme risk of prejudice to the Defendant's interest if the counsel withdraws, as the trial is approaching and the Defendant would be left without representation. The judge concluded that permitting withdrawal at this time would likely cause a great injustice to the Defendant, and therefore denied the motion. The ruling is conditioned on the moving counsel giving notice to all parties and filing proof of service with the court.
