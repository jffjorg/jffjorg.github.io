STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a toxic tort action alleging that Plaintiff Melendez-Murillo
developed silicosis and consequential injuries by breathing in dust from
Defendants’ stone products generated by his work as a fabricator and polisher
of stone countertops.
 
Attorney Mike M. Khalilpour on
behalf of the Green Law Group, LLP, counsel for Defendant Modern Stone, Inc.,
moves to be relieved as counsel. 
 
 
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Attorney Mike M. Khalilpour on
behalf of the Green Law Group, LLP, counsel for Defendant Modern Stone, Inc.,
moves to be relieved as counsel. 
 
Moving counsel filed all three required forms (MC-051,
-052, and -053) and filed proof of service with the Court. Moving counsel
served the motion on Defendant by mail and confirmed that the address was
current by mail return receipt requested. (MC-052 ¶ 3(b).) 
 
In general, an attorney may withdraw with
or without cause so long as the withdrawal would not result in undue prejudice
to the client’s interest – i.e., counsel cannot withdraw at a critical point in
the litigation, because that would prejudice client, but can withdraw
otherwise. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal. App. 4th 904,
915.) The court has discretion to deny an attorney’s request to withdraw where
the withdrawal would work an injustice or cause undue delay in the proceeding,
but the court’s discretion in this area is one to be exercised reasonably. (Mandell
v. Superior Court (1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 1, 4.)
 
Moving Counsel states that withdrawal is
necessary because Defendant “has not performed as required by the engagement
agreement” thereby “imped[ing] the ability to continue to prosecute in this
litigation and pursue relief for the client.” (MC-052 ¶ 2.) Here, although
trial in this matter is currently set for June 10, 2025, there is a pending
motion for trial preference set to be heard on October 30, 2024, at 9:00 AM,
alongside a status conference for this complex case. In the eventuality that
preference is granted, trial in this action would necessarily be advanced to no
later than February 27, 2025, just over four months away. (Code Civ. Proc. §
36(e).) The Court therefore concludes that there is an extreme risk of prejudice
to the Defendant’s interest, as it would be left without counsel and thereby
immobilized on the eve of trial. Absent some showing of an irreconcilable
conflict of interest, permitting withdrawal seems likely to cause a great
injustice to Defendant. As no such conflict has been asserted, the Court is not
inclined to permit withdrawal at this time. 
 
Accordingly, Attorney Mike
M. Khalilpour on behalf of the Green Law Group, LLP’s Motion to be Relieved as
Counsel for Defendant Modern Stone Inc. is DENIED. This ruling is conditioned
on Moving Counsel giving notice to all parties and filing proof of service with
the Court. 
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
