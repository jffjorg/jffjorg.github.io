**Summary**

The Judge's tentative ruling denies the plaintiff's and cross-defendant's motion to enforce a settlement agreement executed on February 20, 2024. The parties stipulated to the settlement agreement, which includes terms for payment, accounting, and deed delivery. However, the defendants have failed to comply with the settlement agreement, and the parties dispute the scope of the accounting and the range of materials needed to prepare it. The Judge declines to address the interpretation issues and fee issues raised in the opposition.
