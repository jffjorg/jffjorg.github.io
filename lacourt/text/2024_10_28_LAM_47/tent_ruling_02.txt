CASE
HISTORY:
·        
02/15/23: Complaint filed. 
 
STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is an employment discrimination and wage and hour action brought by
a husband and wife against their former employers. Plaintiffs allege that
Defendants consistently underpaid them, failed to provide accommodations for
injuries and disabilities, and constructively terminated Plaintiffs.  
 
Plaintiffs brought fourteen motions
to compel initial responses to various sets of discovery, including form
interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production
propounded to each Defendant, and for sanctions. At a September 12, 2024
Informal Discovery Conference, the Court determined that the motions were moot
except for the issue of sanctions and ordered the parties to submit a joint
statement on the amount of sanctions to be awarded. The parties submitted their
joint statement on September 30, 2024, and so the Court now rules on the amount
of sanctions to be imposed. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
            Plaintiff Miguel Alvarez moved to
compel Bennettis Italia, Inc. to respond to form interrogatories, to compel
Defendant Mohammad Ahmadinia to respond to special interrogatories and requests
for production, and to compel Defendant Sara Ahmadinia to respond to form
interrogatories and requests for production. Plaintiff Alvarez also sought
sanctions against each Defendant and their counsel, jointly and severally, in
the amount of $1,411.65 on the one motion to the corporate Defendant, and
$736.65 on each of the two motions brought against each of the individual
Defendants. Plaintiff Nelly Torres moved to compel each Defendant to respond to
form interrogatories, special interrogatories, and requests for production, and
sought sanctions against each Defendant and counsel, jointly and severally, in
the amount of $736.65 on each of her nine motions. Following the parties’ meet
and confer efforts, Plaintiffs request sanctions in the flat amount of $7,000
in attorney’s fees plus $863.10 in costs. (Joint Statement p.6.) 
 
            Failing to respond or to submit to
an authorized method of discovery is a misuse of the discovery process.  (Code of Civ. Proc. § 2023.010.) Under
California Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030, subd. (a), “[t]he court
may impose a monetary sanction ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the
discovery process, or any attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the
reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result
of that conduct. . . . If a monetary sanction is authorized by any provision of
this title, the court shall impose that sanction unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”
 
            Sanctions
are mandatory in connection with motions to compel responses to interrogatories
or requests for production against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel. (Code Civ. Proc. §§
2030.290(c); 2030.300(d); 2031.300 (c); 2031.310(h).) However, sanctions are
not mandatory if the court “finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.”  (Id.)
 
            Here, Plaintiffs are requesting
$7,000 in attorney’s fees plus $863.10 in costs. As originally noticed,
Plaintiff Alvarez sought $1,411.65 in sanctions against Defendant Bennettis
Italia, Inc., reflecting two hours of attorney time at $650 per hour, plus
$61.50 in filing fees. (Joint Statement p.5:13-14.) For each of the remaining
motions, Plaintiffs sought only $736.65 on each motion, reflecting the same
filing fee but only one hour of attorney time at the same rate of $650. (Joint
Statement p. 5:15-16). Thus, Plaintiff Alvarez sought $1,350 in attorney’s fees
against each Defendant, reflecting 2 hours on one motion and one hour on each
of two motions against the individuals, plus $61.65 in filing fees against the
corporate Defendant and $123.30 against each individual Defendant. Plaintiff
Torres, in bringing three motions against each Defendant seeking $736.65 in
sanctions on each motion, sought a total of $1,950 in fees plus $184.95 in
costs against each Defendant. In lieu of that initial request, Plaintiffs seek
a flat award of $7,000 in fees plus the filing costs, reflecting approximately 70%
of the total fees sought. 
 
            Defendants freely concede in their
joint statement that sanctions are proper in this circumstance and do not
object to a full award of the filing costs for each of the fourteen motions. (Joint
Statement p. 7:7-9.) Defendants object, however, to the amount of attorney’s
fees sought on the basis that both the claimed rate and hours incurred are
excessive, relying on Defendants’ counsel’s $300 rate as justification for
their position. Even if defense counsel’s rate and assertions regarding the
reasonable time to prepare these motions were appropriate evidence—and they are
not—Defendants’ argument is of little force here, as Plaintiffs have
preemptively requested reduced sanctions. That said, the Court cannot simply
award a flat $7,000 in sanctions because each Plaintiff noticed several
discovery motions and sanction requests against different parties, and to
impose a flat sanction would violate Defendants’ individual due process rights.
(See Code Civ. Proc. § 2023.040.) Instead, the Court will apply a 30% reduction
to the fees sought by each Plaintiff against each Defendant so as to properly
apportion the sanction award. 
 
            Applying a 30% reduction to the fees
only, the Court determines that the appropriate fee awards are $945 each to
Plaintiff Alvarez on his one motion against the corporate Defendant and two
motions against each individual Defendant and $1,365 to Plaintiff Torres on
each set of three motions pertaining to each of the three Defendants. The final
total for each award, including costs, is therefore: (1) $1,006.65 to Plaintiff
Alvarez from the corporate Defendant and counsel, jointly and severally; (2) $1,068.30
to Plaintiff Alvarez from each individual Defendant and counsel, jointly and
severally; and (3) $1,534.95 to Plaintiff Torres from each of the three
Defendants and counsel, jointly and severally. 
 
            Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ requests for sanctions are GRANTED as follows:
 
            Plaintiff
Alvarez is awarded $1,006.65 in sanctions against Defendant Bennettis Italia,
Inc., and its counsel Bruce Benjamin, jointly and severally.
 
            Plaintiff
Alvarez is awarded $1,068.30 in sanctions against Defendant Mohammad Ahmadinia,
and counsel Bruce Benjamin, jointly and severally.
 
            Plaintiff
Alvarez is awarded $1,068.30 in sanctions against Defendant Sara Ahmadinia, and
counsel Bruce Benjamin, jointly and severally.
 
            Plaintiff
Torres is awarded $1,534.95 in sanctions against Defendant Bennettis Italia,
Inc., and its counsel Bruce Benjamin, jointly and severally.
 
            Plaintiff
Torres is awarded $1,534.95 in sanctions against Defendant Mohammad Ahmadinia,
and counsel Bruce Benjamin, jointly and severally.
 
            Plaintiff
Torres is awarded $1,534.95 in sanctions against Defendant Sara Ahmadinia, and
counsel Bruce Benjamin, jointly and severally.
 
            All
sanctions are to be paid by each set of responsible parties to counsel for
Plaintiffs within 10 days of this order. 
 
            Moving
Parties to give notice.
