[2] Confusingly, Plaintiff seems
to acknowledge that Demurring Defendants have not yet breached the contract.
Plaintiff alleges “Plaintiff’s anticipation of Defendants Khosravizadeh,
ALDEA GROUP LLC and BENJAMIN’S repudiation is reasonable based on the facts
pled herewith…[s]pecifically, Defendant Khosravizadeh already sought Plaintiffs
eviction, which if successful, would be in material breach of the
Agreement.” (SAC, ¶ 5.4 (emphasis added).)


[3] Plaintiff alleges his
second cause of action against Khosravizadeh and Gilanians. The Court will
address the adequacy of Plaintiff’s second cause of action as against Gilanians
when it addresses Gilanians’s Demurrer, below. 


[4] In finding that
Plaintiff has stated sufficient facts to state his second cause of action
against Gilanians, the Court is largely relying on Plaintiff’s allegations
contained in paragraphs 4.6-4.7, 4.11, and 4.15 of his SAC, incorporated into
his second cause of action via reference in paragraph 6.0. Though the second
cause of action contains some allegations in support of Plaintiff’s
constructive fraud cause of action against Gilanians, Plaintiff’s allegations
in his second cause of action largely concern Khosravizadeh’s and Gilanians’s
alleged failure to comply with the agreement and transfer title to Plaintiff, allegations
which the Court discussed at length above as insufficient to support a cause of
action for constructive fraud/breach of fiduciary duty. (See, e.g., SAC,
¶¶ 6.5, 6.11-6.12.)
