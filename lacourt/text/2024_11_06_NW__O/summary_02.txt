And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge is considering a case involving a contract dispute between the plaintiff and several defendants, including Khosravizadeh, ALDEA GROUP LLC, and BENJAMIN'S, as well as Gilanians. The plaintiff is seeking relief for alleged breaches of the contract, including constructive fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. The judge notes that the plaintiff acknowledges that the demurring defendants have not yet breached the contract, but rather is anticipating future breaches. The judge has determined that the plaintiff has stated sufficient facts to state a second cause of action against Gilanians, but is reserving judgment on the adequacy of the allegations against Gilanians until it addresses their demurrer.
