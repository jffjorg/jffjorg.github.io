The judge is troubled by Cho's conduct, as this is the second time the case has been dismissed for failure to prosecute due to Cho's admitted error. The judge has ordered an OSC re: sanctions, in which Cho will be asked to explain why he should not be personally sanctioned for his conduct. The plaintiff's motion to set aside is granted, and the case will proceed with a hearing on the sanctions.
