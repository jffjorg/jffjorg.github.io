And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend to file a first amended complaint (FAC). The plaintiff seeks to add new causes of action for retaliation in violation of Labor Code sections 1102.5 and 1197.5, as well as an injunction to the relief sought under the section 17200 claim. The motion is unopposed, and the court finds that granting the motion would not result in meaningful prejudice to the defendant. The plaintiff's motion is adequately supported by a proposed amended pleading and a substantive explanation as to why the new allegations are necessary. The court will adopt this tentative as the final order unless a party submits an objection by email or appears at the hearing.
