 Case No.: 
  24STCV00197  
 
 
 
 Hearing
  Date:  October 7, 2024




 
Plaintiff’s
motion for leave to amend to file a FAC is GRANTED. 
 
            On
1/3/2024, Joon Koh (Plaintiff) filed suit against Shinhan Diamond America, Inc.
and Shinhan Diamond Industrial Co., LTD, alleging: (1) age discrimination; (2)
race discrimination; (3) failure to prevent; (4) retaliation; (5) wrongful
termination; and (6) violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200. 
 
            On
7/29/2024, Plaintiff moved for leave to amend to file a first amended complaint
(FAC).
            
            The
motion is unopposed. 
 
Discussion  
 
Plaintiff
seeks leave to amend to file a FAC.
 
The proposed
amendment would add causes of action for retaliation in violation of Labor Code
sections 1102.5 and 1197.5 which were not included in the original Complaint.
It would also add an injunction to the relief sought under the section 17200
claim, and the caption and body of the SAC would be renumbered to reflect the
change of firm name and the addition of the two new causes of action. 
 
The
policy favoring leave to amend is so strong that it is an abuse of discretion
to deny an amendment unless the adverse party can show meaningful prejudice.
(Atkinson v. Elk Corp. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 739, 761.)
 
Here, trial
is not until 11/17/2025. Plaintiff’s motion is adequately supported by a
proposed amended pleading and a substantive explanation as to why the new
allegations are necessary, and why they were not alleged sooner. Accordingly,
the Court finds no meaningful prejudice would result from granting leave to
amend. 
 
Based on the
foregoing, Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend to file a FAC is granted. 
 
 
It is so ordered.
