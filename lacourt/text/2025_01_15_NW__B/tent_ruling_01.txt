I.      
BACKGROUND  
On
May 26, 2022, Plaintiffs Oswaldo Dominguez Martinez (“Martinez”) and the Estate
of Osvaldo Dominguez Flores (“Flores Estate”)(collectively Plaintiffs”) filed a
complaint against Defendants Javier Garcia (“Defendant”) and Does 1 to 50
alleging two causes of action for (1) general negligence; and (2) motor vehicle
negligence.
On
December 16, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant motions to compel Defendant’s
further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, Special Interrogatories,
Set One, Request for Admissions, Set One, and Request for Production of
Documents, Set One (“Discovery Motions”). Plaintiffs also request sanctions.
On
December 31, 2024, Defendant filed their oppositions.
On
January 7, 2025, Plaintiffs filed their replies.
 
II.         
LEGAL
STANDARD
Interrogatories
Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. §
2030.300 provides, in pertinent part, that “[o]n receipt of a response to
interrogatories, the propounding party may move for an order compelling a
further response if the propounding party deems that any of the following
apply: (1) An answer to a particular interrogatory is evasive or incomplete.
(2) An exercise of the option to produce documents under Section 2030.230 is
unwarranted or the required specification of those documents is inadequate. (3)
An objection to an interrogatory is without merit or too general.” (CCP §
2030.300(a).) 
Unless notice of a motion to
compel further responses is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed
in writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further
response. (CCP § 2030.300(c).) 
 
Request for Admissions
CCP § 2033.290 provides, in
pertinent part, that “[o]n receipt of a response to requests for admissions,
the party requesting admissions may move for an order compelling a further
response if that party deems that either or both of the following apply: (1) An
answer to a particular request is evasive or incomplete. (2) An objection to a
particular request is without merit or too general.” (CCP § 2033.290(a).) 
Unless notice of a motion to
compel further responses is given within 45 days of the service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed
in writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further
response. (CCP § 2033.290(c).)
 
Request for Production of Documents
CCP § 2031.310 provides, in
pertinent part, that “[o]n receipt of a response to demand for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling, the demanding party may move for an order
compelling further response to the demand if the demanding party deems that any
of the following apply: (1) A statement of compliance with the demand is
incomplete. (2) A representation of inability to comply is inadequate,
incomplete, or evasive. (3) An objection in the response is without merit or
too general.” (CCP § 2031.310(a).)
Unless notice of a motion to
compel further responses is given within 45 days of service of the verified
response, or any supplemental verified response, or on or before any specific
later date to which the propounding party and the responding party have agreed
in writing, the propounding party waives any right to compel a further
response. (CCP § 2031.310(c).)
Under California law, the
objecting party has the burden of justifying its objections when the
propounding party requests that the Court order further responses. (Coy v.
Superior Court (1962) 58 Cal.2d 210, 220-221.) Further, under CCP §
2023.010, it is a misuse of discovery to make unmerited objections. (CCP §
2023.010(e).)
 
 
III.      
DISCUSSION 
Meet and Confer Requirement
A motion to compel further
responses shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration. (CCP §§
2030.300(b), 2033.290(b), and 2031.310(b).) Plaintiff claims Defendant made a
blanket Fifth Amendment objection to all discovery responses, as this case
arises out of a hit and run pedestrian fatality, of which Defendant was the
driver of the subject vehicle. (Venit ¶¶ 3-4.) As a result, both parties have
met and conferred extensively regarding discovery. To date, the parties have
completed at least three informal discovery conferences (“IDC”). (Ibid. At
¶ 5.) The last completed IDC was held on May 15, 2024. (Ibid.) After the
last IDC, Plaintiffs’ counsel attempted to further meet and confer with defense
counsel but was unsuccessful. (Ibid. at ¶ 8.) Defendant served
supplemental responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, on May 19, 2024. (See
Reply p. 3:13-16.) However, Plaintiffs did not file the instant motion to
compel Defendant’s further responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, until
December 16, 2024, well after the 45-day deadline imposed by CCP § 2031.310(c).
Therefore, Plaintiff waives any objections to Defendant’s supplemental
responses to Form Interrogatories, Set One, served on May 19, 2024. (CCP §
2031.310(c).) However, Defendant failed to serve any further responses to Plaintiffs’
Special Interrogatories, Set One, Request for Admissions, Set One, or Request
for Production of Documents, Set One. Therefore, with respect to these
discovery motions, Plaintiffs satisfy the meet and confer requirements of CCP
§§ 2030.300(b) and 2033.290(b), and 2031.310. Accordingly, the Court now
considers Plaintiffs’ motions to compel Defendant’s further responses to
Special Interrogatories, Set One, Request for Admissions, Set One, or Request
for Production of Documents, Set One.
 
Defendant’s Fifth Amendment Rights
Considering that the issue
of Defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights are central to each motion, the Court first
addresses Defendant’s right to protection from self-incrimination during
discovery.
". . . [M]atters which
are privileged are outside the scope of discovery and a court may not make an
order compelling an individual to make responses which that person reasonably
apprehends could be used in a criminal prosecution of him or which could at the
least lead to evidence that might so be used.” (A & M Records, Inc. v. Heilman
(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 554, 556.) “On the other hand the enactment of the
Discovery Act of 1957 was intended to take the ‘game element’ out of trial
preparation and do away with surprise at trial. [Citations.] The accomplishment
of this purpose compels the court to prevent a litigant claiming his
constitutional privilege against self-incrimination in discovery and then
waiving the privilege and testifying at trial. Such a strategy subjects the
opposing party to unwarranted surprise.” (Ibid.) To that end, if the
alleged offense is . . . barred by the statute of limitations, and there is no
pending prosecution against the witness, he cannot claim privilege under the
provision of the constitution, since his testimony could not be used against
him in any criminal case against himself. [Citation.]” (Blackburn v.
Superior Court (1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 414, 428.)
The parties’ dispute can be pared down to whether the
statute of limitations under Cal. Pen. Code § 801 has run, thereby protecting
Defendant from self-incrimination in discovery. Plaintiff argues that the
three-year statute of limitations has run and, as a result, Defendant is no
longer at risk of criminal prosecution. Defendant argues that the applicable
statute of limitations is actually six years, and that they are therefore at
risk, since the hit and run occurred on August 11, 2021. (Opposition p.
2:7-20.)
Pen. Code § 801 provides that “prosecution
for an offense punishable by imprisonment in the state prison . . . shall be
commenced within three years after commission of the offense.” (Pen. Code §
801.) Cal. Veh. Code § 20001 governs hit and run felonies, providing that
“[t]he driver of a vehicle involved in an accident resulting in injury to a
person, other than himself or herself, or in the death of a person shall
immediately stop the vehicle at the scene of the accident and shall fulfill the
requirements of Sections 20003 and 20004.” (Veh. Code § 20001(a).) “A person
who flees the scene of the crime after committing a violation of [this code] .
. . shall be punished by an additional term of imprisonment of five years in
the state prison.” (Veh. Code § 20001(c).) Therefore, Veh. Code § 20001(a) and
(c) fall under the three-years statute of limitations provided by Pen. Code §
801.
Pen. Code § 803(j)(1) provides that “. . . if
a person flees the scene of an accident that caused death or permanent, serious
injury, as defined in subdivision (d) of Section 20001 of the Vehicle Code, a
criminal complaint . . . may be filed within the applicable time period
described in [Penal Code] Section 801 or 802 or one year after the person is
initially identified by law enforcement as a suspect in the commission of the
offense, whichever is later, but in no case later than six years
after the commission of the offense.” (Pen. Code § 803(j).)
Here, it is alleged that, on August 11, 2021,
Defendant was driving a speeding tow truck when they fatally struck decedent
Osvaldo Dominguez Flores (“Decedent”) and fled the scene. (Venit Decl. ¶ 2.)  These actions violated Veh. Code § 20001,
thereby invoking the statute of limitations imposed by Pen. Code §§ 801 and
803(j)(1). The Los Angeles Police Department (“LAPD”) investigated the incident
and eventually arrested Defendant on the basis that he was the driver of the
tow truck that killed Decedent. (Venit Decl. ¶ 3.) The District Attorney (“DA”)
eventually dropped charges against Defendant on the basis that there was no new
evidence that would lead to a conviction of Defendant beyond a reasonable doubt
within one year of presentation. (Ibid.) Therefore, over one year has
passed since Defendant was initially identified by law enforcement as a suspect
in the underlying offense, and over three years have passed since the offense
itself. Accordingly, pursuant to § 803(j), Defendant is no longer at risk of
prosecution in connection with the underlying offense. Defense counsel
misrepresents Pen. Code § 803(j) by stating that the applicable statute of
limitations is six years. However, six years provides a maximum statute of
limitations should law enforcement identify a suspect after the three-year
statute of limitations under Pen. Code § 801 has run. Here, law enforcement
identified Defendant as a suspect before the three-year statute of limitations
expired. Therefore, the six-year statute of limitations does not apply.
Accordingly, the alleged offense is barred by
the statute of limitations pursuant to Pen. Code §§ 801 and 803(j); therefore,
in the instant civil action, Defendant cannot object to discovery on Fifth
Amendment grounds.
 
Special Interrogatories, Set One
Defendant asserts blanket Fifth Amendment objections
to Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 1, 7-9, 11-14, 26, and 32-35. (See
Plaintiffs’ Special Interrogatories, Set One, Special Statement.) As
discussed supra, Defendant cannot assert this objection. Therefore, Defendant
is ordered to provide verified, objection-free, supplemental responses to
Special Interrogatories, Set One, Nos. 1, 7-9, 11-14, 26, and 32-35.
 
Request for Admissions, Set One
Defendant asserts blanket Fifth Amendment
objections to Request for Admissions, Set One, Nos. 1 and 3-15. (See Plaintiffs’
Request for Admissions, Set One, Special Statement.) As discussed supra,
Defendant cannot assert this objection. Therefore, Defendant is ordered to
provide verified, objection-free, supplemental responses to Request for
Admissions, Set One, Nos. 1 and 3-15.
 
Request for Production of Documents, Set One
Defendant asserts blanket Fifth Amendment
objections to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos. 21-22 and
30-31. (See Plaintiffs’ Request for Production of Documents, Set One,
Special Statement.) As discussed supra, Defendant cannot assert this
objection. Therefore, Defendant is ordered to provide verified, objection-free,
supplemental responses to Request for Production of Documents, Set One, Nos.
21-22 and 30-31.
 
Sanctions
“The court may impose a
monetary sanction against a party engaging in the misuse of the discovery
process, or any attorney advising that conduct” under CCP § 2023.030(a). A
court has discretion to fix the amount of reasonable monetary sanctions. (Cornerstone
Realty Advisors, LLC v. Summit Healthcare Reit, Inc. (2020) 56 Cal.App.5th
771, 791.)
Here, Defendant failed to
meaningfully respond to Plaintiffs’ Special Interrogatories, Set One, Request
for Admissions, Set One, and Request for Production of Documents, Set One. However,
Defendant’s objections were not unmerited as they reasonably concerned his and
his attorney’s interpretation of his constitutional rights. Therefore, monetary
sanctions are not awarded pursuant to CCP § 2023.010(e).
 
IV.   
CONCLUSION
Based
on the foregoing, Plaintiffs’ Discovery Motions are GRANTED in part and DENIED
in part.
The
Court ORDERS that Defendant provides verified, complete, and code-compliant
responses, without objections, to Plaintiffs’ Special Interrogatories, Set One,
Nos. 1, 7-9, 11-14, 26, and
32-35, Request for Admissions, Set One, Nos. 1 and 3-15, and Request for Production
of Documents, Set One, Nos. 21-22 and 30-31.
Moving
party is ordered to give notice.
