The parties have agreed to settle the claims for $18,000, with $3000 going towards medical expenses, $4500 towards attorneys' fees, and $1562.33 towards costs of suit. The net balance of $8937.67 will be placed in a blocked account. The court has reviewed the settlement and finds it fair and reasonable. The petition for approval of the settlement is granted. The court notes that Woolfolk, who was also a plaintiff in her individual capacity, will recover nothing from the settlement. The court also reminds counsel that there is an OSC re: dismissal on calendar concurrently with the hearing on the petition and asks them to make arrangements to appear remotely.
