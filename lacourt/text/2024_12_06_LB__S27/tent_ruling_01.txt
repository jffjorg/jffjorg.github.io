  Case Number:  22LBCV00612    Hearing Date:   December 6, 2024    Dept:  S27 Plaintiffs, Bless Enunwa and Ashlee Woolfolk filed this action against
Defendants, Lomita STEAM Magnet School and Los Angeles Unified School District
for damages arising out of a forehead burn sustained by Enunwa while performing
an experiment during school hours and under school supervision.  Enunwa is a minor and is appearing in the
action by and through her GAL, Woolfolk. 

 
Enunwa, by and through her attorney and GAL, has agreed to settle all
claims with Defendants for the total amount of $18,000.  If the settlement is approved, $3000 will be
used for medical expenses, $4500 for attorneys’ fees, and $1562.33 for costs of
suit; the net balance of $8937.67 will be placed in a blocked account.
 
The Court has reviewed the settlement and finds it fair and
reasonable.  The requested fees represent
25% of the gross settlement, and are also fair and reasonable.  The petition is therefore granted.
 
The Court notes that Woolfolk was also a plaintiff in this action in her
individual capacity, but it appears she will recover nothing by way of the
settlement.  The Court wishes to confirm
this at the time of the hearing.  
 
The Court notes that the petition was properly filed as an expedited
petition, and therefore no personal appearance by Plaintiff or her GAL is
necessary.  
 
Counsel are reminded that there is an OSC re: dismissal on calendar
concurrently with the hearing on the petition. 
The Court asks Counsel to make arrangements to appear remotely at the
OSC and hearing on the petition.
