Here is a summary of the Tentative Ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by defendants Blanca Guevara and Panorama Apartment Homes, LLC to the First Amended Complaint filed by plaintiff Fidelia Hernandez Solorzano. The demurrer challenged three causes of action: the seventh cause of action for violation of Civil Code section 1941.1, the eleventh cause of action for discrimination - FEHA violation, and the twelfth cause of action for elder abuse.

The judge sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the seventh cause of action, finding that plaintiff failed to present legal authority to support her contention that Civil Code section 1941.1 can be the grounds to support a cause of action.

The judge overruled the demurrer as to the eleventh cause of action, finding that plaintiff sufficiently alleged that she is in a protected class based on her race and that defendants refused to repair/maintain her unit or provide repair/maintenance services to her unit and/or threatened to evict her based on her race.

The judge sustained the demurrer with 20 days leave to amend as to the twelfth cause of action, finding that plaintiff failed to plead specific facts to support a financial elder abuse claim. The judge also denied, without prejudice, the ex parte application to consolidate the case.

It is worth noting that the judge did not consider an argument raised by defendants for the first time in their reply, as it deprived the plaintiff of proper notice and opportunity to be heard.
