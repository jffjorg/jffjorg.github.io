 Case Number:  23VECV02505    Hearing Date:   October 11, 2023    Dept:  T 23VECV02505 Levi v Keyes
[TENTATIVE] ORDER:  Plaintiff Liel Levi’s Motion to Strike the
Entire Answer is GRANTED.  Plaintiff Liel
Levi’s Alternative Motion to Strike Portions of the Answer is MOOT.
Plaintiff Liel Levi’s Request to
Enter Default is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
Introduction 
Plaintiff Liel Levi (Plaintiff)
moved to strike Defendant Van Nuys-H, Inc. dba Keyes Hyundai of Van Nuys’
(Defendant) entire Answer or alternatively portions of Defendant’s Answer.  Plaintiff further requested that Defendant’s
default be entered.
Discussion  
Plaintiff provided that the
Complaint was verified and Defendant’s Answer was not verified in violation of
Code of Civil Procedure sections 431.30(d) and 446(a).  The argument is well taken and Defendant’s
opposition did not dispute the merits of Plaintiff’s argument.  The motion’s request to strike the Answer is
persuasive.  
Defendant’s opposition only
disputed Plaintiff’s request for default to be entered.  Because Defendant filed a motion to compel
arbitration on September 26, 2023 (currently set to be heard on February 14,
2024), Defendant argued that the instant motion’s request to enter default is
moot/should be denied.  Defendant
proposed that a Verified Answer will be filed in the event the motion to compel
arbitration is denied.  
Because there is no dispute as to
the impropriety of filing an unverified answer, the motion’s request to strike
the Unverified Answer is GRANTED.  
Because Defendant filed a motion
to compel arbitration, Plaintiff’s request to have default entered is DENIED
WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
IT IS SO ORDERED, CLERK TO GIVE
NOTICE.
