And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Jining Zhou v. Said Mohamadreza Siadatan, et al. The defendant, Shenzhen New World II, LLC, had moved to compel further responses from the plaintiff, Jining Zhou, regarding certain discovery requests. The judge has ruled that these motions are moot, as the plaintiff had already served further responses on May 7, 2024.

The defendant had also sought sanctions against the plaintiff and his counsel for their failure to provide non-deficient discovery responses. The judge has granted these sanctions, but in a reduced amount of $2,260.00, as the defendant had failed to establish that the plaintiff's delay in serving responses was unreasonable. The judge has also noted that the defendant's motions were nearly identical and that only one appearance was necessary for the motions, which should have been part of the parties' meet and confer agreement.
