Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Dr. Eugene Dula, MD, against the first and second causes of action in the complaint filed by Elias Olson and Rosalinda Olson. The demurrer argues that the complaint fails to state a cause of action, and that the claims are time-barred by the one-year provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5.

The judge has sustained the demurrer, finding that the complaint does not allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action against Dr. Dula, and that the claims are duplicative of one another. The judge has also ruled that Rosalinda Olson's claims fail to state a cause of action against Dr. Dula, and that she may need to take steps to substitute into the case in her capacity as the personal representative of the estate of Elias Olson.

The judge has also addressed Dr. Dula's argument that the complaint is barred by the one-year provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5, finding that the complaint was not brought within the statute of limitations. The judge has also sustained Dr. Dula's demurrer on the grounds that the complaint does not allege facts sufficient to establish two claims against Dr. Dula for medical malpractice and medical negligence.
