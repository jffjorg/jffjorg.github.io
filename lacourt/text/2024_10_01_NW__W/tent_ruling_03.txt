BACKGROUND
 
This
is an unlawful detainer action.  On July
31, 2024, Plaintiff Joseph Kamkar filed an unlawful detainer complaint against
Defendant Oscar Parada for nonpayment of rent. 
 
[Tentative]
Ruling
 
Defendant Oscar Parada’s Demurrer is OVERRULED. 
 
DISCUSSION
 
Defendant
Oscar Parada demurs to the complaint on the grounds Plaintiff failed to give
proper three-day notice and Defendant did not receive personal service of the
summons and complaint. 
 
The
basic elements of unlawful detainer are “(1) the tenant is in possession of the
premises; (2) that possession is without permission; (3) the tenant is in
default for nonpayment of rent; (4) the tenant has been properly served with a
written three-day notice; and (5) the default continues after the three-day
notice period has elapsed.”  (Kruger v. Reyes (2014) 232
Cal.App.4th Supp. 10, 16.)   
 
The
court finds the complaint proper. Defendant generally concludes that the 3-day
notice was defective on its face but fails to explain how. When ruling on a
demurrer, all facts pleaded in the complaint are assumed to be true.  (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer can
be used only to challenge defects that appear on the face of the pleading under
attack; or from matters outside the pleading that are judicially
noticeable.  (Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318; Donabedian,
supra, 116 Cal.App.4th at 994.) Here, Plaintiff has attached the 3-day notice,
which appears to have been properly served on Defendant. Defendant also argues
he did not receive personal service, contrary to the proof of service attached
to the complaint.  However, the proper
action would have been a motion to quash service. (See Delta Imports, Inc v.
Municipal Court (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 1033, 1036.) Defendant’s reliance on Hinman
v. Wagnon (1959) 172 Cal.App.2d 24 is misplaced since that was a demurrer
as to whether the notice itself was sufficient – not whether the party was
properly served. 
 
Accordingly,
the demurrer is OVERRULED.
