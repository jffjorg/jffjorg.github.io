And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendant's demurrer to the complaint is overruled. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff failed to provide proper three-day notice and that he did not receive personal service of the summons and complaint. However, the judge found that the complaint was proper and that the defendant failed to explain how the 3-day notice was defective. The judge also noted that the defendant should have filed a motion to quash service instead of demurring to the complaint. As a result, the demurrer is overruled and the case will proceed as scheduled.
