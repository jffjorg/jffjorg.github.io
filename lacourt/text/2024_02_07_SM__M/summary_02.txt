Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge denies Defendants' Motion to Strike Punitive Damages Allegations. The Judge finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts from which a reasonable trier of fact could find malice under Civil Code Section 3294(c)(1) and oppression under Civil Code Section 3294(c)(2). The Judge also finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts to plead punitive damages under Civil Code Section 1942.5(h). The Judge notes that Plaintiff is not alleging liability based on the acts of Defendants' employee, so Civil Code Section 3294(b) does not apply. The Judge concludes that Plaintiff's allegations establish authorization or ratification of the wrongful acts based on Defendants' failure to respond to Plaintiff's complaints and the City's citations.
