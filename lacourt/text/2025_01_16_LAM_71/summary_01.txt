```

And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to compel further production of documents from the plaintiff, D.P., in response to the defendant's request for production of documents (RFP) Nos. 113-124. The plaintiff had objected to these requests as protected by the attorney work product doctrine, but the judge has ruled that the plaintiff waived this privilege by placing the contents of the privileged communications at issue in the case.

The judge has also denied the defendant's request for sanctions against the plaintiff and his counsel, Herman Law, in the amount of $4,230. The judge has determined that the dispute centered around the issue of a privilege, and therefore is disinclined to issue sanctions.

The plaintiff is ordered to provide the defendant with Code-compliant responses to RFP Nos. 113-124 within 20 days. The defendant's motion to compel further responses is granted, and the plaintiff's work-product privilege is waived.
