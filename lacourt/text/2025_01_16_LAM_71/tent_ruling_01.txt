$4,230, for failing to produce documents. 
(Notice of Motion, pgs. 2-3; C.C.P. §§2023.010 et seq., 2031.010 et seq.)
 
          Discussion
Having reviewed Defendant’s Motion to Compel Further Responses from Plaintiff
to Defendant’s RFP 2, the Court rules as follows.
          On October 8, 2024, Defendant
served RFP 2 on Plaintiff.  (Decl. of Malekian
¶9.)  On November 12, 2024, Plaintiff
objected to the requests as being protected by attorney work product doctrine.  (Decl. of Malekian ¶10, Exh. H.)  Defendant now moves to compel further responses.  
          C.C.P. §2018.030(b)
provides, “[t]he work product of an attorney, other than a writing described in
subdivision (a) [‘a writing that reflects an attorney’s impressions,
conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories’], is not discoverable
unless the court determines that denial of discovery will unfairly prejudice
the party seeking discovery in preparing that party’s claim or defense or will
result in an injustice.”  (C.C.P. §2018.030(b).)
The
California Supreme Court held in Coito v. Superior Court that “a
witness statement obtained through an attorney-directed interview is entitled
as a matter of law to at least qualified work product protection.”  (Coito v. Superior Court (2012)
54 Cal.4th 480, 499.)  A party seeking
disclosure of witness statements has the burden of establishing denial of disclosure
will unfairly prejudice the party in preparing its claim or defense or will
result in an injustice.    (Id.) 

“Unfair
prejudice,” as an exception to the attorney work product privilege, results
where the party seeking discovery establishes that there exists no adequate
substitute for the material generated by the expert; conversely, when the party
has an equivalent opportunity to generate comparable evidence in its own case
presentation, there is no unfair prejudice. 
(Jimenez v. Superior Court (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 824, 253.)  A showing that no adequate substitute for the
material sought exists must be supported by competent evidence.  (Id.)
The
protection of the attorney work product privilege is not waived except by a
disclosure wholly inconsistent with the purpose of the privilege, which is to
safeguard the attorney’s work product and trial preparation.  (Meza v. H. Muehlstein & Co. (2009)
176 Cal.App.4th 969.)  The
attorney-client or attorney work product privilege may be implicitly waived by
placing the contents of the privileged communications at issue in the case;
where privileged information goes to the heart of the claim, fundamental fairness
requires that it be disclosed for the litigation to proceed.  (2,022 Ranch, L.L.C. v. Superior Court (2003)
113 Cal.App.4th 1377.)
Here, Plaintiff waived the work-product privilege by placing the
contents of the privileged communications at issue in the case; namely, by referencing
the work-product at issue in this motion during Bobbie Harper’s (“Harper”)
deposition.  (See Decl. of Malekian ¶3, Exh. B at 18:13:17 [“Ms. Harper, do you recall having a
conversation with an investigator with my office where you told him that
Delbert Wright had been arrested for sexually abusing a 17-year-old male back
in the 1980s?”]; 27:14-23 [“Q Isn’t it true that you previously stated that
there were rumors at your church – excuse me – that there were rumors that the
perp – ‘perp’ meaning Delbert Wright – was sexually abusing basketball players
while he was a coach? A I never heard that, ma’am. I never heard that. Q My
question was a little bit different. Did you ever say that to our
investigator?”]; 41:17-19 [“And is it safe to say that the investigator
disclosed certain facts to you that you previously would not have had any
personal knowledge about?”].)
Defendant has demonstrated good cause to compel further responses to RFP
Nos. 113-124 because Plaintiff implicitly waived his work-product
privilege by placing the contents of the privileged communications at issue in
the case; where privileged information goes to the heart of the claim,
fundamental fairness requires that it be disclosed for the litigation to
proceed.  (Golden Door Properties, LLC
v. Superior Court of San Diego County (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 733.)  Accordingly, Plaintiff is ordered to provide
Defendant with Code-compliant responses to RFP Nos. 113-124 within 20 days.
Defendant requests monetary sanctions in the amount of $4,230 against Plaintiff
and his counsel of record.  Given that
the dispute centered around the issue of a privilege, the Court is disinclined to
issue sanctions.  
Moving Party is to give notice of this ruling.
