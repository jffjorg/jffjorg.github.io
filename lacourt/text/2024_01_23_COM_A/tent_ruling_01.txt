 Robert Penfield v. Chanda Zaveri, et al.
Tuesday, January

[TENTATIVE] ORDER
GRANTING MOTION BY DEFENDANT, CHANDA ZAVERI, TO COMPEL PLAINTIFF TO RESPOND TO
FORM INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE, AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER
GRANTING MOTION BY DEFENDANT, CHANDA ZAVERI, TO DEEM ADMITTED THE FIRST OF
REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION PROPOUNDED TO PLAINTIFF AND REQUEST FOR SANCTIONS
 
      This
action arises from Defendants’ alleged breach of a promissory note for
$540,000. Plaintiff alleges one cause of action for breach of contract for the
$290,000 balance due. 
      Defendant,
Chanda Zaveri, served form interrogatories and requests for admission on
Plaintiff on October 17, 2023. Although Defendant permitted one extension,
Plaintiff failed to respond. The motions were timely served on October 17,
2023, but Plaintiff did not file an opposition. 
       Where a party fails to timely respond to
interrogatories, the court has authority to compel a response. (Code Civ.
Proc., §2030.290(b).) Untimely responses result in a waiver of objections.
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290(a).)  
      Where a
party fails to respond to requests for admission, the court can deem the
requests admitted against the non-responding party unless it finds that the
non-responding party has subsequently served, before the hearing, a proposed
response to the requests that substantially complies with statutory
requirements. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280 subd. (c).) Imposition of sanctions is mandatory
where a party’s failure to respond to the requests necessitates the motion. Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280 subd. (c).)
      Plaintiff
did not file an opposition showing substantial justification for failing to
respond to written discovery. Accordingly, both motions are GRANTED. Plaintiff is
ordered to serve verified responses without objection to the first set of form
interrogatories within 10 days. The requests for admission are deemed admitted
against Plaintiff. 

      The Court imposes monetary sanctions against
Plaintiff, Robert Penfield, incurred for one hour to prepare each motion and
one hour to appear. The Court finds that a reduced rate of $375 to prepare
these discovery motions is reasonable. Accordingly, Plaintiff is ordered to pay
Defendant a total of $1,125 (3 hours x $375) for both motions within 10 days.
