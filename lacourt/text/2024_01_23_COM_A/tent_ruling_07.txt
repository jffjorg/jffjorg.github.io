 Hawthorne

[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
TWO PETITIONS FOR APPROVAL OF COMPROMISE OF MINORS’ SETTLEMENT 
 
      The
complaint filed on April 3, 2017, alleges that Plaintiffs sustained injury on March
21, 2016, when Defendants’ police cruiser struck Plaintiffs’ vehicle.
Plaintiff, Jenny Oliden, was pregnant at the time of the incident. The twin
Plaintiffs, Audrey Huitron and Scarlett Huitron, were born prematurely, five
days after the incident. 
      Petitioner
is Plaintiff, Jenny Oliden, the mother, and Guardian ad Litem of the minor
claimant who seeks approval of the Plaintiffs’ settlement, as shown below. (CA
R LOS ANGELES SUPER CT Rule 4.115.) The parties globally settled the claims
for $11,400,000 to be distributed as follows:



Jenny Oliden,
  Mother


$1,400,000.00




Audrey Oliden,
  Claimant


5,000,000.00




Scarlett
  Huitron, Claimant


5,000,000.00




TOTAL
  SETTLEMENT


$11,400,000.00



 
      Both
claimants suffered traumatic brain injury as a result of the incident,
resulting in cognitive and speech delays. 
      Each claimants’
medical expenses were reduced from $481,616.84 for Scarlett and $572,845.04 for
Audrey. The following expenses will be reimbursed to the medical care providers
according to their letter agreements to accept a reduced lien amount. (Decl. of
John J. Rice, Lien Negotiator.) 



Bakersfield Family
  Medical Group (Scarlett)


$20,000.00




Bakersfield Family
  Medical Group (Audrey


$20,000.00



 
      Plaintiffs’
counsel requests attorney’s fees totaling $1,750,000, which is 35 percent of
each minor claimant’s recovery. (Cal.
Rules of Court, 7.955.) In determining a reasonable fee, the court may consider
the following non-exclusive factors: the fact that a person with a disability
is involved and that person’s circumstances; the amount of the fee in
proportion to the value of the services performed; the novelty and difficulty
of the questions involved and the skill required; the amount involved and the
results obtained; the experience, reputation, and ability of counsel and the
attorney’s relative sophistication. If the fee is contingent, the court
considers the risk of loss borne by counsel, the amount of costs advanced, and
the delay in payment of fees and obtaining reimbursement for costs. (Cal.
Rules of Court, 7.955 subd. (b).)
      The
Court has considered the declaration of Plaintiffs’ counsel, Gregory Rizio, who
took this case on a contingency fee basis and who advanced costs. He attests to
the case’s difficulty and complexity, specifically in establishing that the
Claimants’ injuries were caused by Defendants, and establishing whether
Claimants’ mother should have been on bed rest at the time of the incident. The
Court finds the fee request is reasonable under all the circumstances. 
      The
Court has reviewed the billing records of counsel for costs incurred in
litigating this matter. Costs incurred exclusively on behalf of the minor
Claimants were divided equally. Otherwise, counsel allocated 1/3 of the
remaining costs between the three Plaintiffs. Accordingly, the distribution of
the gross settlement amount for each Claimant is as follows:



Gross Settlement


 


$5,000,000.00




Medical expenses


$20,000.00


$20,000.00




Attorney’s fees 


1,750,000.00


1,750,000.00




Attorney’s costs


265,919.17


265,919.17




<Total costs>


 


-$2,035,919.17




Net settlement for
  each Claimant


 


$2,964,080.83



 
      For
each Claimant, the Guardian ad Litem proposes to use $2,500,000 from each
Claimant’s net settlement to fund a single-premium deferred annuity for their
benefit. The balance of $464,080.83 will be transferred to a trust created for
each Claimant. 
      The
Probate Division has reviewed the trust terms and concluded that the main
requirements for court created or funded trusts have been met. (Cal. Rules of Court,
rule 7.903(c) and LASC rule 4.116(b).)
      The
Court has considered Petitioners’ additional request to grant authority to the trustee
to invest in mutual funds and bonds with maturity dates greater than five years
to provide for diversification and a higher rate of investment return.  (Attachment 18b(7).)  Given the size of the trust assets, the Court
GRANTS Petitioners’ request. 
      The
Court also GRANTS distribution of $3,500 in fees to trust specialist counsel,
the Dale Law Firm, for tasks relating to each minor’s settlement trust
including drafting of the trust instruments and related portions of this
petition.   
      The
posting of a bond is ordinarily required of a trustee unless the trustee is a
corporate fiduciary. (California Rules of Court, Rule 7.903(c)(5), Probate Code
section 2320.) The proposed trustee is Capital
First Trust Company. Accordingly, posting of a bond is not required.   
      Based
on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS both petitions for approval of settlement,
distribution, and the creation and funding of the proposed trust. Petitioners
are ordered to file LASC Form PRO 044 forthwith to open a trust supervision
action in the Probate Division. Petitioners shall file a first trust accounting
by March
 24, 2025 in the trust supervision action at which time the Probate
Division will set an OSC re Accounting. This Court sets an OSC re: funding of
settlement and purchase of annuity for April 1,
 2024, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Courthouse.
