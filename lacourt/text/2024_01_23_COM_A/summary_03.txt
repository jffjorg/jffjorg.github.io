And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the Plaintiffs' motion to compel the Defendant, Kia America, Inc., to comply with a court order to produce documents related to the Plaintiffs' request for production of documents (Set One). The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendant failed to comply with its statutory obligations to replace a 2022 Kia Nero-EV or pay restitution after failing to repair defects, in violation of the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The Plaintiffs have attempted to meet and confer with the Defendant, but the Defendant has failed to comply with the court's order. The Defendant claims that it intends to comply but has been delayed due to circumstances beyond its control, and is asking for an extension of the production date to February 23, 2024. The Judge finds that the Defendant has not shown good cause to extend the time to comply and orders the Defendant to comply with the court's November 16, 2023, order within five days.
