And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motions to compel the plaintiff to respond to form interrogatories and requests for admission. The defendant served these discovery requests on October 17, 2023, but the plaintiff failed to respond and did not file an opposition. The judge has deemed the requests for admission admitted against the plaintiff and has ordered the plaintiff to serve verified responses to the form interrogatories within 10 days. Additionally, the judge has imposed monetary sanctions against the plaintiff in the amount of $1,125, which is the cost of preparing the discovery motions and appearing at the hearing.
