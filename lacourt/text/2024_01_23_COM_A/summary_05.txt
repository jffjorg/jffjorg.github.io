And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the plaintiffs' first amended complaint and has sustained the demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend. The plaintiffs have alleged claims of fraud, conspiracy, and unfair competition against the buyers, but the judge has found that the allegations are insufficient to state a cause of action. Specifically, the judge has ruled that the allegations of conspiracy are defective because they do not allege that the buyers had a mutual understanding with Bonnie to sell the property for less than its value. The judge has also ruled that the allegations of unfair competition are defective because they do not allege that the buyers engaged in an underlying unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent activity. The judge has given the plaintiffs an opportunity to amend the complaint, but has denied leave to amend because the allegations remain defective.
