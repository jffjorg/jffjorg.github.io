Summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has denied Nissan's motion to compel arbitration of the claims brought by the plaintiffs. Nissan argued that the Retail Installment Sales Contract between the plaintiffs and Carson Nissan required arbitration of all claims arising out of the purchase or condition of the vehicle. However, the court held that Nissan, as the manufacturer of the vehicle, is not a signatory to the contract and therefore does not have the power to elect arbitration of the claims. The court also held that the plaintiffs' claims are not founded on the contract and therefore are not subject to arbitration. The court followed the opinions of the appellate courts in Ochoa v. Ford Motor Company and Montemayor v. Ford Motor Co., which held that a manufacturer cannot compel arbitration of claims brought by a consumer under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act.
