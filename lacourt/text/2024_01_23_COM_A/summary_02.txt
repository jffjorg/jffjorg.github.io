```

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has denied the Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. The Defendant argued that the revival of childhood sexual abuse claims through AB 218 is unconstitutional because it provides a gift of public funds and creates new liability where none existed before. The Judge disagreed, finding that AB 218 serves a public purpose and does not constitute a gift of public funds.

The Judge also found that the claims are adequately alleged with required specificity, and that judgment on the pleadings is denied. The complaint is not fatally uncertain for failure to allege evidentiary facts, and the District has a duty to protect students from known and knowable dangers posed by school employees.

The Judge also denied the Defendant's contention that the claim for negligent supervision of a minor is duplicative of the claim for general negligence, and that the District does not owe a duty to protect students from a particular type of risk. The Judge noted that the statutes on which the Plaintiff relies do impose a duty on the District to supervise and protect students from known and knowable dangers posed by school employees.
