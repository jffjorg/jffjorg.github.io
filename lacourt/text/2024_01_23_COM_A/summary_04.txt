And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The judge's tentative ruling is a continuation of the motion to quash service of summons by Midea Electric Trading (Singapore). The motion is based on the lack of personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The plaintiffs argue that Midea Electric Trading (Singapore) has purposefully availed itself of California's privileges by regularly using California ports to import and distribute its air conditioning units, and that the company has systematically served the California market with its air conditioners, causing injury to the plaintiffs. The defendant argues that it did not ship the subject air conditioner and remote to California and was not involved in the shipping process. The judge has granted the request for jurisdictional discovery and has set a continued hearing date. The judge is inclined to grant a continuance to the hearing on all three motions, including those of the other defendants, GD Midea Air Conditioning Equipment Co., LTD and Wuhu Maty Air Conditioning Equipment, Inc. Ltd.
