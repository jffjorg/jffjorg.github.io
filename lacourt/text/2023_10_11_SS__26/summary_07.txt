And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the plaintiff's motion to compel defendant's responses to special interrogatories and requests sanctions. The defendant, Ahmad Ghazi, must serve verified responses to the special interrogatories without objections within 20 days of service of this order. Additionally, the defendant is ordered to pay sanctions of $500.00 to the plaintiff's counsel within 20 days of service of this order. The judge's decision is based on the defendant's failure to respond to the plaintiff's discovery requests despite a meet and confer effort, and the defendant's misuse of the discovery process.
