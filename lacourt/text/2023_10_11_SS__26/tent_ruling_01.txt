ANALYSIS:
 
On August 27,
2020, Plaintiff State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (“Plaintiff”)
filed this subrogation action against Defendant Jessica Summer Doolan
(“Defendant”). On July 28, 2021, Plaintiff
filed a copy of the parties’ settlement agreement with a request for dismissal
and retention of jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. The
Court dismissed the action pursuant to the stipulation on the same date. (Stip
and Order, filed 07/28/21.) 
 
On December 21, 2021, Plaintiff filed a
Motion to Vacate Dismissal, Enforce Settlement and Enter Judgment but the
Motion was withdrawn before it came for hearing. Plaintiff re-filed the Motion
to Vacate Dismissal, Enforce Settlement, and Enter Judgment on June 27, 2023.
To date, no opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
 
The instant motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure, section
664.6, which states in relevant part:
 
If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd.
(a).) Prior to January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the
litigants themselves, not their attorneys. 
(Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.) The current
statute provides that “parties” includes “an attorney who represents the party”
and an insurer’s agent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b).) The settlement
must include the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement,
and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v.
Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) Plaintiff has demonstrated the settlement agreement complies with
the statutory requirements set forth above as it was signed by both parties and
Plaintiff’s attorney. (Motion, Benson Decl., Exh. 1, p. 4.)
 
Furthermore, the request for
retention of jurisdiction must be made in writing, by the parties, before the
action is dismissed for the Court’s retention of jurisdiction to conform to the
statutory language. (Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 433 [“If,
after a suit has been dismissed, a party brings a section 664.6 motion for a
judgment on a settlement agreement but cannot present to the court a request
for retention of jurisdiction that meets all of these requirements, then
enforcement of the agreement must be left to a separate lawsuit.”].) The
parties’ request for retention of jurisdiction complies with these requirements
because it was made in writing to the Court before the action was dismissed.
(Motion, Benson Decl., Exh. 1, ¶11.) 
 
The settlement provides that
Defendant would pay Plaintiff $7,003,27 through an initial payment from
Defendant’s insurer of $4,003.27, followed by Defendant’s monthly payments
starting on July 15, 2021. (Id. at Exh. 1, ¶2.) The settlement agreement
also provides that upon Defendant’s default, Plaintiff would seek judgment in
the demand of the Complaint ($11,840.59), less any monies paid, plus costs and
prejudgment interest. (Id. at Exh. 1, ¶¶1, 5.) Payments of $5,803.37
were made towards the settlement, after which Defendant defaulted. (Id.
at ¶¶5-6 and Exh. 2.) Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff is entitled to entry of
judgment against Defendant in the amount of $6,037.22 principal ($11,840.59 -
$5,803.37.) and $526.65 costs. (Id. at ¶8.)

Plaintiff State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Company’s Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement is GRANTED.
JUDGMENT TO BE ENTERED IN PLAINTIFF’S FAVOR AND AGAINST DEFENDANT JESSICA SUMMER DOOLAN IN THE AMOUNT OF
$6,037.22 PRINCIPAL AND $526.65 COSTS.
