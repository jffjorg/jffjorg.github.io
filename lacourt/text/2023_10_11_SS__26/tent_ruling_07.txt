ANALYSIS:
 
On June 26, 2023, Plaintiff Alejandro Diaz (“Plaintiff”)
served Special Interrogatories, Set One, on Defendant Ahmad Ghazi (“Defendant
Ghazi”). (Motion, Mehrban Decl., Exh. A.)
Despite a meet and confer effort extending the deadline to serve verified
responses without objections, Defendant Ghazi has not served responses. (Id.
at ¶¶4-5 and Exh. B.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motions to Compel Responses
to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, on August 28,
2023. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290.) Based on Defendant Ghazi’s failure to
respond to the propounded discovery, Plaintiff is entitled to an order
compelling them to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without
objections. 
 
Defendant Ghazi’s failure to timely respond constitutes a
misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)
Sanctions are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and
2023.030 and have been properly noticed. Sanctions are awarded against
Defendant Ghazi in the amount of $500.00 based on one hour of attorney time
billed at $500.00 per hour. (Motion, Mehrban Decl., ¶6.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Alejandro Diaz’s Motion to Compel Defendant Ahmad
Ghazi’s Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for
Sanctions, is GRANTED. DEFENDANT AHMED
GHAZI IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE, WITHOUT
OBJECTIONS, WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. DEFENDANT AHMED GHAZI IS
ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $500.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S
COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
 
 
Moving party to give notice.
