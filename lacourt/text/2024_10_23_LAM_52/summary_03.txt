And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the petition filed by J.G. Wentworth Originations, LLC for approval of the transfer of structured settlement rights by payee Tyler Adkins. However, the petition is incomplete and does not provide the required information, including the payee's address, marital status, and information about dependents. Additionally, the affidavit submitted by Adkins is procedurally defective and does not meet the requirements of California law. Therefore, the Court denies the petition without prejudice, meaning that the petition may be refiled with the necessary information.
