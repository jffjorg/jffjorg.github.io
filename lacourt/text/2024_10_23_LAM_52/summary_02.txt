And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied plaintiff Ana Kim Nguyen and cross-defendants Tracy Nguyen Le and Tammy Tat's motion in limine to preclude defendants Vinh Hoang Lam dba Tips & Toes Nail Bar and Amy Thu Tran from introducing or referring to evidence that was requested in discovery but not disclosed and/or produced. The judge ruled that the motion is too generic and would not provide meaningful guidance to the parties or witnesses. The judge also noted that the moving parties did not provide specific evidence showing that they propounded discovery seeking specific information or documents or that defendants did not provide the requested information or documents. Additionally, the judge ruled that the moving parties did not comply with Local Rule 3.57(a) by failing to submit a declaration identifying the specific matter alleged to be inadmissible and prejudicial and representing to the court that the subject of the motion has been discussed with opposing counsel.
