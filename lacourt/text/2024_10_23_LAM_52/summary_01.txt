And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted defendants' motion for discovery sanctions in part. The plaintiff, Victor Enright, failed to serve timely responses to defendants' discovery requests, including interrogatories and requests for production. As a result, Enright waived all objections to these requests. Despite this, Enright continued to object to the requests and did not serve responses until more than 30 days after the court's order. The court finds that Enright's actions were not justified and orders him to serve further verified responses without objections within 20 days. Enright is also ordered to produce all responsive documents concurrently with the written responses. Additionally, Enright and his counsel, Darren Richie, are ordered to pay $4,156.02 in sanctions within 20 days.
