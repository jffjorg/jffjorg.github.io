 Case Number:  23SMCV00765    Hearing Date:   January 21, 2025    Dept:  I The
matter is here for an FSC.  The court
gave the FSC order on 8/21/23, however no FSC materials have been filed.  The court will inquire as to the reason.  Perhaps the case has settled, which would be
an excellent reason not to file FSC materials (although a notice would have
been nice).
