And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has written a tentative ruling ahead of the upcoming hearing on January 21, 2025. The judge believes that Buckley has waived any objections to Pomerantz's jury instructions. The judge also assumes that the objections to exhibits have been exchanged between the parties and are included in the trial binders. The judge plans to discuss Buckley's request for a court reporter at the hearing, noting that the request was filed at the last minute and the judge is unsure if it is timely. Additionally, the judge is unsure if Buckley's prior fee waiver request is still valid. The judge will also discuss Buckley's brief regarding his 170.3 motion, which the judge believes is in error.
