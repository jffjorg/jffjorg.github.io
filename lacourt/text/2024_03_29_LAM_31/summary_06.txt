And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has reviewed the demurrer filed by Carr, Fredericks, and Mohler and has sustained it with leave to amend. The plaintiff's claims of retaliation are being dismissed because they were not made within the applicable statutory period. Additionally, there is no evidence to support the claim that any adverse employment action was taken against the plaintiff as a result of the alleged retaliation. The judge notes that the plaintiff's suspicion of theft was reported in 2018, but this allegation does not support the retaliation claim because it occurred outside the applicable statutory period.
