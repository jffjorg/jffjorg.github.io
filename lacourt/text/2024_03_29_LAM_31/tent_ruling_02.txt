TO COMPEL RESPONSES TO DISCOVERY 
 
MOTION
TO DEEM REQUESTS FOR ADMISSIONS ADMITTED



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Fermin Garcia
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
On September 26, 2022, Plaintiff, Fermin Garcia, filed this
action against Defendants, Quik Tow LLC (“Quik Tow”) and Ignacio Gonzalez, for wage
and hour violations.
 
On July 19, 2023, Plaintiff served Quik Tow with Form
Interrogatories—General, Set One, Special Interrogatories, Set Two, and Request
for Admissions Set, Two.  Quik Tow did
not not serve responses.
 
On September 28 and September 29, 2023, Plaintiff filed these
motions to compel Quik Tow’s responses to the Form Interrogatories—General, Set
One, and Special Interrogatories, Set Two, and to deem the Requests for
Admissions, Set Two, admitted against Quik Tow.  Plaintiff requests sanctions against Quik Tow
and its counsel.
 
On January 19, 2024, defense counsel for Quik Tow filed a
status report indicating that verified responses to the at-issue discovery was
served on Plaintiff on January 10, 2024. 
However, the court did not see the filing prior to the hearing of this
motion.
 
The motions were heard on January 23, 2024.  Defense counsel appeared for Quik Tow.  Based on oral argument, the court continued
the hearings for these motions and ordered the following:
 
1.     
Counsel for Defendant is to comply
with the court’s order and provide further responses.[1]

2.     
Parties are to meet and confer
within the next ten (10) days to eliminate any remaining failures on the
Counsel for Defendant’s part. 
3.     
If there is no compliance after the
meet and confer or the issues are not resolved, Counsel for Plaintiff can file
a Motion for Evidentiary Sanctions. 
4.     
Counsel for Defendant is to respond
in writing to any missing discovery as outlined in the declaration before the
meet and confer date. 
5.     
If the issues are resolved, Counsel
for Plaintiff is to file a status report no later than five (5) court days
before the next hearing date. 
6.     
Counsel for Defendant of record must
appear and handle the meet and confer conference.
 
The court
now rules as follows: 
 
II.        LEGAL
STANDARDS 
 
            If a party
to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order to compel responses without
objections.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (b).)¿ If a party to whom
requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order that the truth of the matters specified
in the requests be deemed admitted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (b).)¿
Failure to timely serve responses waives objections to the requests.¿ (Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (a), 2033.280, subd. (a).)¿¿¿¿ ¿¿ 
 
Monetary
Sanctions¿¿ 
 
            Code of
Civil Procedure section 2023.030 is a general statute authorizing the Court to
impose discovery sanctions for “misuse of the discovery process,” which includes
(without limitation) a variety of conduct such as: making, without substantial
justification, an unmeritorious objection to discovery; making an evasive
response to discovery; and unsuccessfully and without substantial justification
making or opposing a motion to compel or limit discovery.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §
2023.010.)¿¿¿ 
 
            If
sanctions are sought, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.040 requires that
the notice specify the identity of the person against whom sanctions are sought
and the type of sanction requested, that the motion be supported in the points
and authorities, and the facts be set forth in a declaration supporting the
amount of any monetary sanction.¿¿ 
 
            If the
court finds that a party has unsuccessfully made or opposed a motion to compel
responses to interrogatories or inspection demands, the court “shall impose a
monetary sanction . . . unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction
acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the
imposition of the sanction unjust.”¿ (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290, subd. (c),
2031.310, subd. (h).)¿¿¿  
 
Sanctions against counsel:¿ The court in Kwan
Software Engineering, Inc. v. Hennings (2020) 58 Cal.App.5th 57, 81 (Hennings)
noted that discovery sanctions against an attorney are governed by a different
standard than sanctions against a party:¿¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
By the terms of the statute, a trial court under section
2023.030(a) may not impose monetary sanctions against a party’s attorney unless
the court finds that the attorney “advised” the party to engage in the conduct
resulting in sanctions. (§ 2023.030(a); Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle (1993)
20 Cal.App.4th 256, 261, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿ “Unlike monetary sanctions
against a party, which are based on the party's misuse of the discovery
process, monetary sanctions against the party's attorney require a finding the
‘attorney advis[ed] that conduct.’ ” (Ibid.) “It is not enough that the
attorney's actions were in some way improper.” (Corns v. Miller (1986)
181 Cal.App.3d 195, 200, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247 (Corns).) Because an
attorney's advice to a client is “peculiarly within [his or her] knowledge,”
the attorney has the burden of showing that he or she did not counsel discovery
abuse. (Ibid.) Accordingly, when a party seeking sanctions against an
attorney offers sufficient evidence of a misuse of the discovery process, the
burden shifts to the attorney to demonstrate that he or she did not recommend
that conduct. (Id. at pp. 200–201, 226 Cal.Rptr. 247; Ghanooni,
at p. 262, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 501.)¿
 
III.       DISCUSSION
 
            The motions are moot. 
Attached to defense counsel’s January 19, 2024 declaration, are verified
responses to the at-issue discovery requests. 
The verified responses were served on January 10, 2024.  Accordingly, the court considers only the
issue of sanctions. 
 
            Monetary
Sanctions
 
            Plaintiff
requests sanctions against Quik Tow and its counsel.  Given the court has granted these motions,
sanctions are warranted.  Indeed, in the context of requests for
admissions, sanctions are mandatory.¿ (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280, subd.
(c).)  Pursuant to Hennings, supra, imposition of monetary
sanctions against counsel is also proper unless counsel shows that he or she
did not counsel the discovery abuse.¿ (Hennings, 58 Cal.App.5th at p.
81.)¿ Here, defense counsel requests that the court not impose sanctions
because defense counsel’s office recently relocated and their paralegal was out
on bereavement during the first week of November 2023.  (Saunders Decl., ¶¶ 7, 8.)  Defense counsel only establishes that
sanctions should be imposed against defense counsel only.  Accordingly, sanctions are imposed against Quik
Tow’s attorney of record only in the amount of $1,310, consisting of two hours
at plaintiff’s counsel hourly rate and $210 in filing fees.
 
IV.       CONCLUSION
 
            Plaintiff’s
discovery motions are MOOT.
 
            The request
for sanctions is GRANTED.  Counsel for
Defendant Quik Tow LLC is ordered to pay sanctions in the sum of $1,310, to be paid
to Plaintiff by and through his counsel within 30 days of this order.
 
Moving party to give notice.
