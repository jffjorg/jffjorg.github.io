[1] On December 26, 2024, Carr,
Fredericks, and Mohler separately filed a demurrer to the Second and Twelfth
Causes of Action.  On February 1, 2024, the
court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.


[2] As alleged, Plaintiff did not make
these complaints about Carr’s conduct within the applicable statutory
period.  Moreover, there are no
allegations establishing a causal link between those complaints and any adverse
employment action taken against Plaintiff.


[3] In 2018, Plaintiff reported his
suspicion that Carr was stealing.  In
response, Fredericks dismissed Plaintiff’s complaint and attempted to enforce a
write-up against Plaintiff.  This
allegation, however, does not support Plaintiff’s retaliation claim as it
occurred outside the applicable statutory period.  Nor is it clear whether the write-up was
ultimately enforced or if it altered Plaintiff’s employment.
