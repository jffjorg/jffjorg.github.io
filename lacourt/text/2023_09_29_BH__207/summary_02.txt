And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the Defendant's motion to quash service of summons and complaint. The Defendant argues that the Plaintiff did not attempt to personally serve her prior to resorting to substitute service, and that the substitute service was not properly effectuated. However, the judge finds that the Plaintiff has met their burden in demonstrating that the Defendant was properly served with the summons and complaint by substitute service. The judge also finds that the Defendant's Vasquez Declaration lacks sufficient competent proof to rebut the presumption that the information set forth in the proof of service is true. Therefore, the judge denies the Defendant's motion to quash service of summons and complaint and orders the Defendant to file and serve a response to the complaint on or before October 30, 2023.
