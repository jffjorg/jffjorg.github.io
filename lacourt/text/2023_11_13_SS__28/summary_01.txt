And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has considered the motion filed by Plaintiff's counsel, Lee C. Arter, to be relieved as counsel. The motion was filed on September 7, 2023, and is scheduled to be heard on November 13, 2023. The court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and the motion should be granted if there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. The court has reviewed the moving papers and finds that the attorney-client relationship has broken down irreparably, making it difficult for counsel to effectively represent the plaintiff. The court grants the motion and orders counsel to be relieved as counsel upon filing proof of service of the order.
