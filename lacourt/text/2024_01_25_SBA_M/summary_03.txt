And here is the English-text summary:

The Honorable Gary Y. Tanaka has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Stephanie Jungers, et al. v. Roberto Aguilero Toledo, et al. (Case No. 23TRCV01039). The court has granted the plaintiffs' motion to vacate the dismissal of the action. The plaintiffs alleged that on April 8, 2021, they were involved in a motor vehicle accident with the defendant. The plaintiffs' counsel failed to calendar the October 25, 2023 Order to Show Cause hearing, resulting in the dismissal of the action. The court found that the dismissal was entered due to the mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect of the plaintiffs' counsel, and therefore granted the motion to set aside the dismissal. The case is restored to the active calendar, and the plaintiffs are ordered to give notice of this ruling.
