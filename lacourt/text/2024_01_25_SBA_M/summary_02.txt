And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted defendant's motion to compel plaintiff to appear, testify, and produce documents at deposition, as well as defendant's request for monetary sanctions. The motion was made because the plaintiff had failed to appear for her properly noticed deposition on multiple occasions, despite numerous continuances and schedule accommodations. The judge found that the defendant had attempted to proceed with the deposition on multiple dates, but was thwarted each time by the plaintiff's claims of unavailability. The judge also found that the plaintiff's opposition to the motion was inadequate, as it did not provide a specific date for the deposition. As a result, the judge ordered the plaintiff to appear for her deposition at a date and time to be agreed upon by the parties, or at a reasonable date and time to be determined by the moving party. Additionally, the judge awarded defendant $1,575.00 in sanctions, payable within 30 days, due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with the deposition notice and her counsel's unnecessary efforts to delay the deposition.
