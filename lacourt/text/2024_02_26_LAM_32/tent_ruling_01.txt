  Case No.:  20STCV22351
  Hearing Date:  February 26, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION for prejudgment
  interest 




 


 



BACKGROUND
On July 14, 2020, Margarita Z. Ramirez
(“Plaintiff”) filed her First Amended Complaint against her employer World Oil
Corp. and Asbury Environmental Services (collectively “Defendant”), alleging
the following causes of action: (1) Failure to engage in the interactive
process; (2) Intrusion into private affairs; (3) Failure to provide a
reasonable accommodation; (4) Violation of CFRA rights; (5) Employment
discrimination; (6) Failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation; and (7)
Wrongful constructive discharge.
The matter came on for trial in April
2022, after which the jury returned a verdict for Plaintiff. The jury awarded
$2.9 million in compensatory damages and $3 million in punitive damages ($1.5
million for each Defendant). The Court entered judgment accordingly on May 9,
2022. The Court issued an amended judgment on August 26, 2022 after additional
awards of costs and attorneys’ fees. The amended judgment awarded $4.1 million
against Defendants jointly and severally, along with $1.5 million against each
Defendant.    
On December 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
instant motion for prejudgment interest under Civil Code sections 3288 and 3291.
Defendants have not filed an opposition. 

DISCUSSION
            Civil Code section 3288 allows for
prejudgment interest “[i]n an action for the breach of an obligation not
arising from contract, and in every case of oppression, fraud, or malice.”
(Civ. Code, § 3288.) Section 3291 allows for prejudgment interest in personal
injury cases where the plaintiff makes a Section 998 offer that is not accepted,
and the plaintiff obtains a more favorable result at trial. (Id., §
3291.) 
A request for prejudgment interest “must
be made by way of motion prior to entry of judgment, or the request must be
made in the form of a motion for new trial no later than the time allowed for
filing such a motion.” (North Oakland Medical Clinic v. Rogers
(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 824, 831.) A motion for new trial must be made within 15
days of service of the entry of judgment or within 180 days after entry of
judgment, whichever is earlier. (Code Civ. Proc., § 659(a)(2).) This rule was
followed in Watson Bowman Acme Corp. v. RGW Construction, Inc. (2016) 2
Cal.App.5th 279, 298, where the plaintiff’s request for prejudgment interest
was made less than 15 days after judgment, rendering it timely under Section
659. 
Here, Plaintiff filed her motion more than
one year after the amended judgment of August 26, 2022. Therefore, the motion
is untimely. 
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion for prejudgment
interest is DENIED.
