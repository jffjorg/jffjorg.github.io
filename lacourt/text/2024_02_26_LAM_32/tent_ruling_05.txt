  Case No.:  23STCV31598
  Hearing Date:  February 26, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
defendant’s demurrer to complaint 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On December 27, 2023, Plaintiff
Jerome Eady filed this unlawful detainer action against Defendant Luke Banham. 
            On January 19, 2024, Defendant filed
the instant demurrer to the complaint. Plaintiff has not filed an opposition. 
LEGAL STANDARD
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When
considering demurrers, courts read the allegations liberally and in
context. (Taylor v. City of Los
Angeles Dept. of Water and Power (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 1216, 1228.)
In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the
pleading or by proper judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.30, subd.
(a).) A demurrer tests the pleadings alone and not the evidence or other
extrinsic matters. (SKF Farms v. Superior
Court (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 902, 905.) Therefore, it lies only where the
defects appear on the face of the pleading or are judicially noticed. (Ibid.) The only issue involved in a
demurrer hearing is whether the complaint, as it stands, unconnected with
extraneous matters, states a cause of action. (Hahn, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 747.)
MEET AND CONFER
Before filing a demurrer or a motion to
strike, the demurring or moving party is required to meet and confer with the
party who filed the pleading demurred to or the pleading that is subject to the
motion to strike for the purposes of determining whether an agreement can be
reached through a filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the
objections to be raised in the demurrer. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 430.41, 435.5.)
The Court notes that Defendant has not filed a declaration demonstrating compliance
with the meet and confer requirement. However, this is not a reason to overrule
the demurrer. (Id., § 430.41(a)(4).) Therefore, the Court proceeds on
the merits. 
REQUEST FOR
JUDICIAL NOTICE
            Defendant’s request for judicial
notice is GRANTED. (Evid. Code, §§ 451-452; Scott v. JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 743, 754.) 
DISCUSSION
            “Every
action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest, except as
otherwise provided by statute.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 367.) “Generally, ‘the
person possessing the right sued upon by reason of the substantive law is the
real party in interest.’” (Gantman v. United Pac. Ins. Co. (1991) 232
Cal.App.3d 1560, 1566.) “[A] complaint filed by a party who lacks standing is
subject to demurrer.” (Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67
Cal.App.4th 995, 1004.) 
            Plaintiff alleges in the complaint
that his interest in the premises is “head of household.” (Compl. ¶ 4.) This
reveals as a matter of law that Plaintiff is not the real party in interest
with standing to pursue unlawful detainer. Plaintiff neither owns the property
nor has any right to payment of rent. Plaintiff is actually being sued for unlawful
detainer by the real owner of the property, Circa 1200 LLC. (Def.’s RJN, Ex.
1-3.) In his answer to that complaint, Plaintiff did not deny any allegations,
including that he is a tenant of the subject property, and Circa 1200 LLC is
the owner. (Id., Ex. 4; Code Civ. Proc., § 431.20(a) [material allegations
not denied are deemed as true].) 
            It is apparent on the face of the
complaint and from judicially noticeable materials that Plaintiff lacks
standing to pursue unlawful detainer. Plaintiff does not oppose the demurrer,
thereby conceding its merit. Because Plaintiff has not articulated how this
defect can be cured, leave to amend is not warranted. 
CONCLUSION
            Defendant’s demurrer is SUSTAINED without
leave to amend.
