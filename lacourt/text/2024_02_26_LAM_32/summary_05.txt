And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The tentative ruling is in response to the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The court finds that the plaintiff lacks standing to pursue the unlawful detainer action because he is not the real party in interest. The plaintiff is a tenant of the subject property, and the real owner is Circa 1200 LLC. The plaintiff did not deny these allegations in his answer to the complaint, and therefore, it is deemed true. The court grants the defendant's request for judicial notice and sustains the demurrer without leave to amend.
