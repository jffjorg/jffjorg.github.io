The plaintiff had filed a motion for prejudgment interest under Civil Code sections 3288 and 3291, seeking interest on the damages awarded. However, the judge found that the motion was untimely, as it was filed more than one year after the amended judgment was entered. The judge cited the relevant statutes and case law, including North Oakland Medical Clinic v. Rogers and Watson Bowman Acme Corp. v. RGW Construction, Inc., to support the finding that the motion was untimely.
