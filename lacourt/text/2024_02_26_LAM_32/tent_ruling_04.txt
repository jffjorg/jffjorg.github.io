  Case No.:  23STCV24356
  Hearing Date:  February 26, 2024
 
     [TENTATIVE]
  order RE:
plaintiff’s motion for leave to file
  first amended complaint 




 


 



BACKGROUND
            On October 6, 2023, Plaintiff Brian
Armstrong filed this employment action against Defendants FH Investment
Partnership, LP, Jeffrey Breitman, and Marla Breitman. 
            On January 4, 2024, Plaintiff
attempted to file a First Amended Complaint, which the Court deemed invalid
because Defendant FH Investment had answered the complaint by that time, and
Plaintiff did not obtain leave of court to file the FAC. (See Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 472(a).) The Court also quashed the service of summons as to Defendants
Jeffrey and Marla Breitman. 
            On January 29, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion for leave to file the FAC. Defendant FH Investment filed its
opposition on February 9, 2024. Plaintiff filed his reply on February 16, 2024.
LEGAL STANDARD
The court may, in furtherance of justice,
and on such terms as may be proper, allow a party to amend any pleading. (Code
Civ. Proc, §§ 473, subd. (a), 576.) Courts must apply a policy of liberality in
permitting amendments at any stage of the proceeding, including during trial,
when no prejudice to the opposing party is shown. (Duchrow v. Forrest
(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1377.) In determining the extent of prejudice to
the opposing party, the court must consider various factors, such as whether
the amendment would delay trial or increase the discovery burden. (Demetriades
v. Yelp, Inc. (2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 294, 306.)
DISCUSSION
A motion for leave to amend a complaint
must be accompanied by a declaration that explains: (1) the effect of the
amendment; (2) why the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) when the facts
giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) the reasons why
the request for amendment was not made earlier. (Cal. Rules of Ct., Rule
3.1324(b).)
Here, counsel’s declaration explains the
effect of the amendment: “Plaintiff seeks by this request to file a First
Amended Statement of Claims (‘FAC’) adding causes of action for unlawful
actions by landlord to influence tenant to vacate, breach of implied covenant
of quiet enjoyment, breach of written lease agreement, breach of employment
contract, and international infliction of emotional distress.” (Moossaian Decl.
¶ 4.) Counsel further explains that while the original complaint arose from Plaintiff’s
employment with Defendants, Defendants’ recent cross-complaint (filed December
2023) for unpaid rent necessitated Plaintiff to amend his complaint to seek
relief relating to his tenancy. (Id., ¶ 3.) This substantially complies
with the requirements of Rule 3.1324(b). 
Additionally, the case was initiated very
recently in October 2023. Therefore, there is no significant delay to be
explained. (See Royal Thrift & Loan Co. v. County Escrow, Inc. (2004)
123 Cal.App.4th 24, 41 [an amendment is properly denied “when offered after long
unexplained delay or on the eve of trial”].) Absent prejudice, which Defendant
has not shown, courts liberally grant leave to amend. (Duchrow, supra,
215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1377.)
CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff’s motion for leave to
amend is GRANTED.
