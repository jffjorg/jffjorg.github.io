And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by a judge regarding a motion by the plaintiff, Brian A. Armstrong, to file a first amended complaint in an employment action against defendants FH Investment Partnership, LP, Jeffrey Breitman, and Marla Breitman. The plaintiff initially filed the action on October 6, 2023, and attempted to file the first amended complaint on January 4, 2024, but was denied because the defendant had already answered the complaint. The plaintiff then filed a new motion on January 29, 2024, and the defendants filed an opposition on February 9, 2024, and the plaintiff filed a reply on February 16, 2024. The judge grants the motion, citing the policy of liberality in permitting amendments at any stage of the proceeding, and finding that the plaintiff has substantially complied with the requirements of the rules of court. The judge notes that the case was initiated recently and there is no significant delay to be explained, and that the defendant has not shown prejudice.
