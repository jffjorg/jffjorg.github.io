And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge is considering a motion for sanctions filed by defendants Roy Lee and RL Films2, Inc. against plaintiffs for failing to pay fees and producing documents. The defendants are seeking $23,926.50 in sanctions, which represents the fees associated with the second motion to dismiss and the instant motion. The judge denies the motion, stating that there is no evidence that the failure to pay fees was in bad faith or frivolous. The judge notes that the parties' stipulation to produce documents and the court's order to pay fees were not fulfilled, and that the failure to pay fees does not necessarily mean that the motion to dismiss was frivolous.
