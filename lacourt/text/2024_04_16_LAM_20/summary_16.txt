```

And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the motions filed by the defendants, seeking to compel the plaintiffs to provide further responses to their requests for production and to admit or deny certain statements. The court will require the plaintiffs to respond to the defendants' requests for production within 20 days. The court will not require the production of visa application documents, which contain private information. The court has denied the defendants' motion to compel the production of contracts signed on behalf of Weifeng, as the request is overbroad and can be better addressed through a request for admission or deposition inquiry.
