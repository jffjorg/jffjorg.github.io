And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled that the expert testimony of Dr. Sayana will be excluded due to a lack of substantiation. Dr. Sayana's opinions are based on incomplete and unreliable information, and she lacks training in relevant fields such as toxicology and epidemiology. The judge finds that Dr. Sayana's opinions are not supported by scientific evidence and are therefore inadmissible.
