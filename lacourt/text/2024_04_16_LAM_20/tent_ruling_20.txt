On June 26, 2023, Reynaldo F. Duran Revocable Living Trust filed a Petition to Compel Arbitration with respect to 25/8 Acquisition and Development LLC and William Hankins.   On September 7, 2024, the Petition to Compel Arbitration was granted. Petitioner has now filed an application to confirm an award arising from arbitration.Code Civ. Proc. § 1285 provides in relevant part, “Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.”Code Civ. Proc. § 1285.4 states, “A petition under this chapter shall: (a) Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement. (b) Set forth the names of the arbitrators. (c) Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.” Code Civ. Proc. § 1286 states, “If a petition or response under this chapter is duly served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered in this state or another state, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the proceeding.”“The trial court has but four courses of conduct once a confirmation proceeding is initiated: 1) to confirm, 2) to correct and confirm, 3) to vacate, 4) to dismiss, where a respondent is not a party to the award or is not bound by the arbitration agreement.” (United Bhd. of Carpenters etc., Loc. 642 v. Demello (1972) 22 Cal.App.3d 838, 840.) The application to confirm arbitration award is granted because (1) Petitioner has attached an applicable arbitration agreement, (2) the arbitrator has been identified as Mark C. Carlson, and (3) Carlson’s award is attached.Petitioner to give notice.If counsel do not submit on the tentative, they are strongly encouraged to appear by LACourtConnect rather than in person due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
