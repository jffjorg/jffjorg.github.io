ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
“This part shall
be known and may be cited as the Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act of
2004.” (Lab. Code, § 2698.)
 
“Notwithstanding
any other provision of law, any provision of this code that provides for a
civil penalty to be assessed and collected by the Labor and Workforce
Development Agency or any of its departments, divisions, commissions, boards,
agencies, or employees, for a violation of this code, may, as an alternative,
be recovered through a civil action brought by an aggrieved employee on behalf
of himself or herself and other current or former employees pursuant to the
procedures specified in Section 2699.3.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (a).)
 
In bringing an action pursuant to the Labor
Code Private Attorneys General Act of (2004) (“PAGA”), “the aggrieved employee
acts as the proxy or agent of state labor law enforcement agencies,
representing the same legal right and interest of those agencies, in a
proceeding that is designed to protect the public, not to benefit private
parties.” (Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1756, AFL-CIO v. Super. Ct. (2009)
46 Cal.4th 993, 1003, citations omitted.)
 
        PAGA claims, as well as
settlements of PAGA claims, involve multiple statutory requirements. (Lab.
Code, § 2699, et seq.)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
The Court considers below the various
statutory requirements of PAGA, as well as whether the settlement meets the
fair, reasonable, and adequate standard.

Legal Standard
 
“A civil action by an aggrieved employee pursuant to subdivision
(a) or (f) of Section 2699 alleging a violation of any provision listed in
Section 2699.5 shall commence only after the following requirements have been
met:
 
“(1)
 
“(A) The aggrieved employee or representative shall

the alleged violation.
 
“(B) A notice filed with the Labor and Workforce
Development Agency pursuant to subparagraph (A) and any employer response to

The fees required by this subparagraph are subject to waiver in accordance with
the requirements of Sections 68632 and 68633 of the Government Code.”
 
(Lab. Code, §

within 10 days following commencement of a civil action pursuant to this part,
provide the Labor and Workforce Development Agency with a file-stamped copy of
the complaint that includes the case number assigned by the court.” (Lab. Code,
§ 2699, subd. (l)(1).)
 
“The superior
court shall review and approve any settlement of any civil action filed
pursuant to this part. The proposed settlement shall be submitted to the agency
at the same time that it is submitted to the court.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd.
(l)(2).)
 
2.         
Discussion
 
Plaintiff filed causes of action for various
labor code violations, including violations of Labor Code sections 201, 202,
203, and others. These sections are covered by Labor Code section 2699.5, and
thus the pre-complaint notice requirement to the Labor Workforce Development
Agency (LWDA) applies here. (Lab. Code, § 2699.3, subd. (a).)
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel declares that Plaintiff
sent a notice letter to LWDA on August 25, 2021. (Decl. Lapuyade, ¶ 4 and Exh.
2.) The Court finds that this meets the notice requirement under Labor Code
sections 2699.3 and 2699.5. 
 
Plaintiff’s Counsel provides evidence that
the notice letter to LWDA on August 25, 2021 also included a copy of the
Complaint in this matter. (Decl. Lapuyade, Exh. 2.) The Court finds that this
meets the notice requirement under Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (l)(1).
 
Plaintiff provides email evidence of
submission of a copy of the proposed settlement to LWDA at the same time that
it submitted the proposed settlement to the Court. (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd.
(l)(2); Decl. Lapuyade, Exh. 3.) Plaintiff further provides email evidence that
the fully-executed settlement agreement has been submitted to LWDA. (Supp.
Decl. Lapuyade, Exh. 2.) The Court finds that this meets the notice requirement
under Labor Code section 2699, subdivision (l)(2).
 
B.         
The PAGA Settlement
 
1.         
Legal Standard
 
“For all provisions of this code except those for which a civil
penalty is specifically provided, there is established a civil penalty for a
violation of these provisions, as follows: . . . (2) If, at the time of the
alleged violation, the person employs one or more employees, the civil penalty
is one hundred dollars ($100) for each aggrieved employee per pay period for
the initial violation and two hundred dollars ($200) for each aggrieved
employee per pay period for each subsequent violation.” (Lab. Code, § 2699,
subd. (f)(2).)
 
“For purposes of
this part, whenever the Labor and Workforce Development Agency, or any of its
departments, divisions, commissions, boards, agencies, or employees, has
discretion to assess a civil penalty, a court is authorized to exercise the
same discretion, subject to the same limitations and conditions, to assess a
civil penalty.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (e)(1).)
 
“In any action by
an aggrieved employee seeking recovery of a civil penalty available under
subdivision (a) or (f), a court may award a lesser amount than the maximum
civil penalty amount specified by this part if, based on the facts and
circumstances of the particular case, to do otherwise would result in an award
that is unjust, arbitrary and oppressive, or confiscatory.” (Lab. Code, § 2699,
subd. (e)(2).)
 
“Except as
provided in subdivision (j), civil penalties recovered by aggrieved employees
shall be distributed as follows: 75 percent to the Labor and Workforce
Development Agency for enforcement of labor laws, including the administration
of this part, and for education of employers and employees about their rights
and responsibilities under this code, to be continuously appropriated to
supplement and not supplant the funding to the agency for those purposes; and 25
percent to the aggrieved employees.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd. (i).)
 
“Except as
provided in paragraph (2), an aggrieved employee may recover the civil penalty
described in subdivision (f) in a civil action pursuant to the procedures
specified in Section 2699.3 filed on behalf of himself or herself and other
current or former employees against whom one or more of the alleged violations
was committed. Any employee who prevails in any action shall be entitled to an
award of reasonable attorney’s fees and costs, including any filing fee paid
pursuant to subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) or
subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of Section 2699.3. Nothing
in this part shall operate to limit an employee’s right to pursue or recover
other remedies available under state or federal law, either separately or
concurrently with an action taken under this part.” (Lab. Code, § 2699, subd.
(g)(1).)

Highlights of the Proposed PAGA Settlement
 
The following are the highlights of the
proposed PAGA settlement:
 
(1)       Defendant SK
Market, Inc. will pay a gross settlement amount of $125,000.00 (the “Gross
Settlement Amount”). 
 
(2)       “PAGA Counsel” (who
are Plaintiff’s Counsel) will be paid up to one-third of the Gross Settlement
Amount (which would be $41,666.67) for fees. PAGA Counsel will also be paid up
to $20,000.00 (which is an additional 16% of the Gross Settlement Amount) in
expenses. Payment less than the amounts requested will be allocated to the
remainder of the “Net Settlement Amount” (which is the “Gross Settlement
Amount” minus these listed costs).  
 
(3)       Apex Class Action
LLC (the “Administrator”) will be paid up to $8,400.00, except for a showing of
good cause and as approved by the Court. This is 6.72% of the Gross Settlement
Amount. To the extent the Administration Expenses are less than $8,400.00 or
the Court approves payment less than $8,400.00, the remainder will be retained
in the Net Settlement Amount.
 
(4)       Plaintiff will be
awarded a service award of not more than $10,000.00. If the Court approves a
service award less than the amount requested, the remainder will be retained in
the Net Settlement Amount. 
 
(5)       LWDA and the
Aggrieved Employees will receive 75% and 25%, respectively, of the remaining
$44,933.33.
 
(6)       There are estimated
to be 363 Aggrieved Employees who worked a total of 19,893 PAGA-relevant pay
periods. The Aggrieved Employees will receive payments from the Administrator
based on a division of the employee share of the PAGA penalties that is
multiplied by each employee’s number of PAGA-relevant pay periods. 
 
(7)       Aggrieved Employees
will have up to 180 days to cash their settlement checks, after which those
checks will be voided, and the funds represented by such checks will be sent to
the “Community Law Project,” subject to Court approval. 
 
(8)       Defendant SK
Market, Inc. has agreed to not receive any reversion from the Gross Settlement
Amount. 
 
(9)       The proposed PAGA
settlement also includes other terms, such as for distribution of the
settlement and release from claims.
 
(Supp. Decl. Lapuyade, Exh. 1.)
 
3.         
Attorneys’ Fees and Attorneys’ Costs
 
PAGA Counsel requests $41,666.67 in
attorneys’ fees, which is one-third of the Gross Settlement Amount. PAGA
Counsel further requests $20,000.00 in costs, which is an additional 16% of the
Gross Settlement Amount. 
 
Notably, Plaintiff has two sets of counsel:
JCL Law Firm, APC (“JCL”) and Zakay Law Group, APLC (“ZLG”). 
 
According to Plaintiff’s Counsel, JCL spent
79.5 hours on this matter while ZLG spent 29.2 hours on this litigation. (Decl.
Lapuyade, ¶ 56.) Each firm has had multiple people work on this matter, and
these individuals charge a variety of hourly rates. In total, Plaintiff’s
Counsel claim that JCL incurred $39,507.50 in fees and that ZLG incurred
$14,087.50 in fees, for a total of $53,595.00 in fees. (Ibid.)
 
The Court has reviewed the hourly rates and
finds them to be reasonable. 
 
However, the Court has also reviewed the
invoices and finds that there has been a significant amount of overbilling on
fees. For example, JCL claims 1.54 hours for “Legal Research – Motion to Strike
and Demurrer Answer”, even though no demurrer or motion to strike was filed and
demurrers to answers are nearly always frivolous. As another example, JCL
claims to have spent more than 8.5 hours drafting the Complaint while ZLG
claims to have spent an additional four hours drafting the Complaint. The
Complaint consists of mostly boilerplate language and has very few specifics as
to Plaintiff and her case; it is unreasonable for counsel to have spent more
than 12.5 hours of attorney time drafting the Complaint.
 
In reducing the attorney's fees and costs
(see below), the Court considers two main factors:
 
First, the Court could reduce the attorney's
fees to zero.  “If . . . the Court were required to award a reasonable
fee when an outrageously unreasonable one has been asked for, claimants would
be encouraged to make unreasonable demands, knowing that the only unfavorable
consequence of such misconduct would be reduction of their fee to what they
should have asked in the first place. To discourage such greed, a severer
reaction is needful.”  (Serrano v.
Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635 [cleaned up].)   “A fee request that appears unreasonably
inflated is a special circumstance permitting the trial court to reduce the award or
deny one altogether.” (Chavez v. City of Los Angeles (2010) 47 Cal.4th
970, 990; Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1137; Serrano v.
Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 635.)

 
        Second, this is really a
zero-sum game.  The more that the attorneys
receive in attorney's fees and costs (or the more that the Administrator receives
or that the Plaintiff receives as a Service Award), the less remains for each
aggrieved employee.  Thus, while the
Court wishes to encourage attorneys to take PAGA cases, at this state of the
case, the interests of the attorneys and the aggrieved employees are opposed.
 
The Court will allow PAGA Counsel
to recover $30,000.00 in attorney’s fees from the Gross Settlement Amount. PAGA
Counsel may determine for themselves how they will split that amount between
their two firms. The remainder of $11,666.67 that was allocated for fees in the
settlement shall be retained in the Net Settlement Amount. 
 
As to costs, the Court has reviewed the cost
invoices by JCL and ZLG and finds that there has also been a significant amount
of overbilling on costs. 
 
First of all, PAGA Counsel admit that their
invoices only add up to $13,153.83, not $20,000.00. (Memorandum, p. 17:13–15.) 
 
Second, certain costs — such as charging
$1,491.01 on October 29, 2021 for filing the Complaint — are obvious examples
of overbilling. (Decl. Lapuyade, Exh. 5, p. 1.) Indeed, to the extent higher
costs were incurred for the initial filing of a complex case, the Minute Order
dated May 19, 2022 clearly ordered that those fees were already ordered
refunded — yet no such refund is included in the invoices.
 
Finally, the Court did not order mediation in
this case. Rather, the Court only ordered the Parties’ respective counsel to
meet and confer regarding mediation. (See Minute Order dated August 3, 2022;
see also Minute Order dated April 17, 2023.) The Court declines to award
combined mediation costs of $8,237.50. (Decl. Zakay, Exh. 2, p. 2, listing
$4,237.50 in mediation costs; Decl. Lapuyade, Exh. 5, p. 1, listing $4,000.00
in mediation costs.) 
 
Considering that only $13,153.83 in
costs were actually claimed and that more than $9,000.00 in costs were either
overbilled or are not allowed, the Court will allow PAGA Counsel to recover
$4,000.00 in costs. This amount reasonably covers the actual costs reasonably
incurred, including the costs for the expert retained in this matter. The
remaining $16,000.00 that was allocated for costs in the settlement shall be
retained in the Net Settlement Amount.
 
4.         
PAGA Administrator Costs
 
PAGA Counsel requests that the Administrator
be paid up to $8,400.00 (which is 6.72% of the Gross Settlement Amount) for
expenses incurred in administering the settlement.
 
The Administrator provides an invoice that
shows the expected costs for administering the settlement. (Decl. Hartranft,
Exh. B.) 
 
The invoice is concerning. 
 
First, the Administrator appears to charge
multiple unclear and/or unnecessary items, such as $300.000 for “project
management reconciliation” and $360.00 for “declarations.” 
 
Second, the Administrator charges
unreasonable prices for certain items, such as $1,200.00 for a certified
language translation to Spanish. 
 
Finally, the overall cost of this service —
$8,400.00 — is thousands of dollars more than the Court has seen other
administrators charge for a similar number of affected employees. 
 
The Court will allow a maximum of $5,000.00
in administration costs. The remaining $3,400.00 that was allocated for
administration costs in the settlement shall be retained in the Net Settlement
Amount. Any further amount unspent in administration costs shall also be
retained in the Net Settlement Amount. 
 
5.         
Remaining Civil Penalties for LWDA and Aggrieved
Employees
 
PAGA Counsel requests that LWDA and the
Aggrieved Employees receive 75% and 25%, respectively, of the Net Settlement
Amount.
 
This division of the civil penalties is
required pursuant to Labor Code section 2699, subdivision i.
 
PAGA Counsel claim that the Net Settlement
Amount is estimated to be $44,933.33. Given the reductions above to other
costs, the Net Settlement Amount should now be at least $71,000.00, pending
further savings by the Administrator.  
 
A division of $53,250.00 to LWDA (i.e., 75%
of the Net Settlement Amount), and $17,750.00 (i.e., 25% of the Net Settlement
Amount) would be appropriate, with any further savings from the Administrator’s
costs being split similarly. 
 
6.         
Reversion of Funds
 
The settlement agreement gives Aggrieved
Employees up to 180 days to cash their settlement checks, after which those
checks will be voided. Further, the funds represented by such checks will be
sent to “Community Law Project,” which, according to its website, is a
non-profit that provides legal advice to low-income and indigent members of the
local San Diego Community. 
 
The settlement agreement cites Code of Civil
Procedure section 384 as the source of authority for this proposed reversion.
(Memorandum, p. 5:16–18; Decl. Lapuyade, Exh. 1, p. 7.)
 
While class actions and PAGA cases have
similarities, they are not the same. Code of Civil Procedure section 384 only
applies to class actions, not PAGA cases. Although the Court is sympathetic to
the proposition of reverting unused funds to indigent people in need of legal
services, the statute clearly requires that the civil penalties recovered
“shall be distributed as follows: 75 percent to [LWDA] for enforcement of labor
laws . . . and 25 percent to the aggrieved employees.” (Lab. Code, § 2699,
subd. (i).) The Court is not aware of any statute that would allow the Court to
revert the civil penalties collected under PAGA toward any purpose aside from
those listed in the statute. 
 
The Parties must return with a new provision
for any reversion, such as reverting any unclaimed funds to the State of
California Unclaimed Property Fund in the Aggrieved Employee’s names, reverting
any unclaimed funds to the Aggrieved Employees, or both. The revised settlement
must clarify in the notice of PAGA settlement that is sent to employees: (1)
the amount of time they have to cash their settlement check; (2) that any
checks they do not cash will be void; and (3) to whom the unclaimed cash will
be sent (e.g., the State of California Unclaimed Property Fund). 
 
7.         
Plaintiff’s Service Award
 
PAGA Counsel request that Plaintiff obtain a
$10,000.00 service award as “fair and reasonable compensation for the
Plaintiff’s efforts bringing the action, assisting PAGA Counsel with the
litigation and settlement, regularly conferring with PAGA Counsel on the status
of her case and the strategies for prosecuting the claims and agreeing to
provide Defendant a broad general release of all claims arising out of her employment.”
(Memorandum, p. 18:5–9.) PAGA Counsel further note that “Plaintiff assumed the
serious risk of liability for Defendant’s costs and potentially fees if the
case was unsuccessful.” (Id. at p. 18:11–12.)
 
        Among other things,
Plaintiff declares that she has been “actively involved with this action” and
that she was “in regular contact with [her] attorneys, reviewed important court
filings, and spent considerable time on the issues presented during the
litigation and in the settlement process.” (Decl.
Villalvazo, ¶ 8.) She estimates that she spent approximately twenty hours
working on this case. (Ibid.). 
 
The Court does not doubt that Plaintiff was
actively involved in this case.  However,
the Court wonders why a non-attorney plaintiff should be compensated for
reviewing “important court filings”; presumably, this is why Plaintiff’s
counsel passed the bar.  Further,
accepting that Plaintiff spent “approximately 20 hours working on this case” [Decl.
Villalvazo, ¶ 8], a $10,000 Service Award would be the equivalent of paying
Plaintiff $500.00/hour.
 
The Court will grant Plaintiff a Service
Award of $5,000.00.  The remaining
$5,000.00 should be added to the Settlement Amount to be distributed to all
aggrieved employees.
 
 
8.         
Notice of Release of Claims
 
PAGA Counsel provides a copy of the proposed
notice to the Aggrieved Employees. (Decl. Lapuyade, Exh. 1.A.)
 
The Court is not satisfied with the proposed
notice. The Court would like PAGA Counsel to submit a revised proposed notice,
which includes (with the capitalization, bolded font, and boxed formatting show
below) the following notice:
 



BY
  CASHING THIS CHECK, YOU ARE NOT GIVING UP ANY RIGHT TO SUE FOR ANY ALLEGED
  GRIEVANCES THAT YOU HAVE AGAINST SK MARKET, INC.



 
C.         
The Fair, Reasonable, and Adequate Standard
 
1.         
Legal Standard
 
The Court of Appeal has held “that a trial court should evaluate a PAGA
settlement to determine whether it is fair, reasonable, and adequate in view of
PAGA’s purposes to remediate present labor law violations, deter future ones,
and to maximize enforcement of state labor laws.” (Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc.
(2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 56, 77, citations omitted.)
 
“Despite the fact
that a representative action under PAGA is not a class action, and is instead a
type of qui tam action, a standard
requiring the trial court to determine independently whether a PAGA settlement
is fair and reasonable is appropriate. . . . Because many of the factors used
to evaluate class action settlements bear on a settlement’s fairness—including
the strength of the plaintiff's case, the risk, the stage of the proceeding,
the complexity and likely duration of further litigation, and the settlement
amount—these factors can be useful in evaluating the fairness of a PAGA
settlement.” (Moniz, supra, at pp. 76–77.)
 
2.         
Discussion
 
PAGA Counsel provides a detailed explanation
of the Parties’ settlement negotiations and PAGA Counsel’s reasoning for why
the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. (Decl. Lapuyade, pp. 5–12.)
This explanation includes an analysis of the total amount of possible claims,
PAGA Counsel’s discounting to those claims based on Defendant’s arguments, and
various litigation risks. (Ibid.)
 
In addition, Plaintiff separately declares
that she believes the proposed settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate.
(Decl. Villalvazo, ¶ 9.)
 
The Court finds that the settlement, as
modified above, meets the fair, reasonable, and adequate standard. 
 
II.       
Conclusion
 
The Motion to Approve PAGA Settlement is
DENIED without prejudice.  
 
        The Parties may
submit a revised proposed Settlement Agreement to the Court for approval.  The Court sets an OSC re Dismissal of this Action
for the date of the trial, February 22, 2024. The Final Status Conference is
vacated. Any proposed Settlement must be approved by the Court prior to that
date.
