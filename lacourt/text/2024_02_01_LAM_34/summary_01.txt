significant_statements:
  - "The Court of Appeal has held 'that a trial court should evaluate a PAGA settlement to determine whether it is fair, reasonable, and adequate in view of PAGA's purposes to remediate present labor law violations, deter future ones, and to maximize enforcement of state labor laws.'" (Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021) 72 Cal.App.5th 56, 77)
  - "Despite the fact that a representative action under PAGA is not a class action, and is instead a type of qui tam action, a standard requiring the trial court to determine independently whether a PAGA settlement is fair and reasonable is appropriate." (Moniz, supra, at p. 76)
