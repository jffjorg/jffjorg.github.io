And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling denies the defendant's motion to transfer the venue of the case from Los Angeles County to another county. The defendant, Linda J. Maultsby, argues that the convenience of three witnesses would be promoted by the change and seeks to transfer the venue. The plaintiff, Mural Media, LLC 401K Plan, opposes the transfer, arguing that the defendant has been defaulted and cannot make this motion. The court finds that the defendant was properly served and did not file an answer or other proper response to the complaint, and therefore, the clerk's office properly entered default on the defendant. As a result, the motion to transfer case is denied without prejudice.
