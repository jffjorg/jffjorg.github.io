The Motion to Transfer Case is DENIED without prejudice. 
 
BACKGROUND:
 
On September 1, 2023,
Plaintiff Mural Media, LLC 401K Plan filed its Complaint against Defendants
Linda J. Maultsby and All Unknown Occupants, Tenants, and Subtenants on a cause
of action for unlawful detainer. 
 
On November 7, 2023,
the Court quashed proof of service of summons on Defendant Linda J. Maultsby
(“Defendant”). 
 
On November 16, 2023,
the Court ordered that Defendant may be served by positing a copy of the
summons and complaint on the premises in a manner most likely to give actual
notice to Defendant, and by immediately mailing, by certified mail, a copy of
the summons and complaint to the Defendant and her last known address. 
 
On December 20, 2023,
Plaintiff filed Judicial Council Form POS-010, Proof of Service Summons, which
stated that the Defendant was served on December 14, 2023 by posting on the
premises in a conspicuous place and by mailing. 
 
On December 26, 2023,
Defendant, in propria persona, filed her Motion to Transfer Case. 
 
On January 4, 2024,
by request of Plaintiff, the Clerk’s Office entered default on Defendant. 
 
On January 18, 2024,
Plaintiff filed its Opposition to the Motion to Transfer Case. 
 
No reply or other
response has been filed in support of the Motion to Transfer Case. 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal Standard
 
“The court may, on motion, change the
place of trial in the following cases:
 
“(a) When the court designated in the complaint is
not the proper court.
 
“(b) When there is reason to believe that an
impartial trial cannot be had therein.
 
“(c) When the convenience of witnesses and the ends
of justice would be promoted by the change.
 
“(d) When from any cause there is no judge of the
court qualified to act.
 
“(e) When a proceeding for dissolution of marriage has
been filed in the county in which the petitioner has been a resident for three
months next preceding the commencement of the proceeding, and the respondent at
the time of the commencement of the proceeding is a resident of another county
in this state, to the county of the respondent’s residence when the ends of
justice would be promoted by the change. If a motion to change the place of
trial is made pursuant to this paragraph, the court may, prior to the
determination of such motion, consider and determine motions for allowance of
temporary spousal support, support of children, temporary restraining orders,
attorneys’ fees, and costs, and make all necessary and proper orders in
connection therewith.”
 
(Code Civ. Proc., §
397.)
 
II.      
Discussion
 
Defendant moves the Court to transfer the venue of this case pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 397, subdivision (c). (Motion to Transfer
Case, pp. 1:22–26, 4:20–22.) Defendant argues that the convenience of three
witnesses would be promoted by the change. (Id. at p. 5:18–28, 6:1–2.)
 
Plaintiff disagrees, arguing: (1) that Defendant has been defaulted and
thus cannot make this motion; (2) that Defendant cannot make this motion
because she has not answered the Complaint; and (3) that no witness will be
inconvenienced if venue remains situated in Los Angeles County. (Opposition,
pp. 3:15–16, 3:23–24, and 4:7–8.)
 
Plaintiff is correct on its first argument. 
 
The Clerk’s Office entered default on Defendant on January 4, 2024.
Defendant was properly served for the first time in this matter on December 20,
2023. 
 
As this is an unlawful detainer case, “when the defendant is served,
the defendant’s response shall be filed within five days, excluding Saturdays
and Sundays and other judicial holidays, after the complaint is served upon the
defendant.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1167, subd. (a).) Given that December 23 and
24, 2023 were the weekend and December 25, 2023 was a holiday, Defendant had
until December 28, 2023 to respond. 
 
In all actions
where the service of the summons was by publication, upon the expiration of the
time for answering, and upon proof of the publication and that no answer,
demurrer, notice of motion to strike of the character specified in subdivision
(f), notice of motion to transfer pursuant to Section 396b, notice of motion to
dismiss pursuant to Article 2 (commencing with Section 583.210) of Chapter 1.5
of Title 8, notice of motion to quash service of summons or to stay or dismiss
the action pursuant to Section 418.10, or notice of the filing of a petition
for writ of mandate as provided in Section 418.10 has been filed, the clerk,
upon written application of the plaintiff, shall enter the default of the
defendant. The plaintiff thereafter may apply to the court for the relief
demanded in the complaint; and the court shall hear the evidence offered by the
plaintiff, and shall render judgment in the plaintiff’s favor for that relief,
not exceeding the amount stated in the complaint, in the statement required by
Section 425.11, or in the statement provided for in Section 425.115, as appears
by the evidence to be just. . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 585, subd. (c).)
 
Had Defendant filed a motion to transfer venue pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 396b, that would have been a response sufficient for
the Clerk’s Office to deny Plaintiff’s request for entry of default. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 585, subd. (c).) But a motion to transfer venue pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 397 is not included among the responses that can stop
the entry of default after service by publication. 
 
As Defendant did not file an answer or other proper response to the
Complaint by December 28, 2023, the Clerk’s Office properly entered default on
Defendant on January 4, 2024. Therefore, Plaintiff correctly argues that
Defendant must seek to vacate the default before she can move for transfer of
venue. 
 
 
III.    
Conclusion
 
The Motion to Transfer Case is DENIED without prejudice.
