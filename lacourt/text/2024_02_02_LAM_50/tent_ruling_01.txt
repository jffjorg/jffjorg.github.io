ORDER RE:
 
MOTION TO DEEM
  REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION ADMITTED
 




 
Defendant M Stephen Cho Esq., (erroneously sued as Stephen Cho)
(herein, “Cho”) moves or an order deeming admitted Requests for Admissions
served on November 11, 2023, and granting monetary sanctions against Plaintiff
Janet Haywood and her counsel of record Ms. Joyce Vega, Esq., jointly and
severally, in the amount of $2,160.00.  
Cho’s
motion will be continued to a new date as set forth below. NO HEARING WILL TAKE PLACE ON FEBRUARY
2, 2024.
Pursuant to the
Court’s power to “amend and control its process and orders so as to make them
conform to law and justice” (Code Civ. Proc., § 128, subd. (a)(8)), the Court
orders the parties in this case to participate in an Informal Discovery
Conference (“IDC”). (Note:¿The Court’s policy regarding IDCs appears in the
Courtroom Information available in Dept. 50 and on the Court’s website.)¿Lead
or other designated counsel for the parties with full authority are ordered to
participate in person in an IDC. After consulting with opposing counsel
regarding available dates, Cho must make a
prompt reservation for the IDC using the Court’s online reservation system. Cho must file Dept. 50’s one-page IDC form in the department
seven days prior to the IDC, and the responding parties may file the same form
in the department setting forth a response three days prior to the IDC.   
Once Cho has confirmed an
IDC date, Cho must use the Court’s online
reservation system to continue the motion to a post-IDC discovery hearing date.
The parties are ordered to have with them whatever materials are needed to make
the IDC session productive and successful. Prior to the IDC date, lead or other
designated counsel for the parties, with full authority, are to meet and
confer, in person or via telephone in a further
attempt to resolve as many of the issues as possible before the IDC. (See
CRC Rule 3.670, subd. (f)(2).) If the parties resolve their discovery disputes
before the IDC date, Cho is ordered to take
both the IDC and the motion off calendar as soon as possible. 
Cho is ordered to provide notice of this Order.
