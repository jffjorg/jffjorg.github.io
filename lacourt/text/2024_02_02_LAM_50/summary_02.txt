And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants the motion to continue the trial date from March 6, 2024 to July 22, 2024. The motion was filed by the plaintiff and several defendants, requesting a continuance due to the plaintiff's inability to obtain all of her medical records, which are necessary for the trial. The defendants opposed the motion, arguing that the plaintiff has delayed in completing her production of requested documents and that the case has already been continued once before. The judge finds that the plaintiff has demonstrated good cause for a brief trial continuance and orders the parties to continue their discovery and settlement discussions. The trial readiness and exhibit binders must be lodged in the court by a certain date, and all discovery deadlines are continued based on the new trial date.
