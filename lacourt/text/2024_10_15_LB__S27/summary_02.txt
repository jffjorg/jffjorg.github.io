The Court grants the Plaintiff's motion to amend the judgment to add HHM International LLC as a judgment debtor. The Plaintiff established that HHM International LLC is the sister company of HHM Intl Inc., the original judgment debtor, and that both entities share the same address, phone number, principals, and business activities. The Court finds that the similar names of the two companies are intentionally confusing and that an order amending the judgment is appropriate. Pursuant to McClellan v. Northridge Park Townhome Owners Ass’n, Inc. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 746, the motion is granted.
