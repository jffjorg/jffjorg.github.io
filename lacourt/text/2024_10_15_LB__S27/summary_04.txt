```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The motion was denied for three reasons. Firstly, the pleadings serve as the "outer measure of materiality" in a summary judgment motion, and the motion cannot be granted or denied on issues not raised by the pleadings. Secondly, the motion addressed only two of the ten causes of action included in the plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint, and the court cannot grant summary judgment on ten causes of action when only two are addressed. Thirdly, a plaintiff seeking summary judgment must prove up an amount of damages, as damages are an element of the cause of action. The court notes that the parties have a Case Management Conference scheduled for today, and Counsel is reminded to make arrangements to appear remotely at the CMC and hearing on the motion.
