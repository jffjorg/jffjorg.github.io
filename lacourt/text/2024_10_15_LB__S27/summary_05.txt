Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motion for a protective order filed by Beach Cities Management, which seeks to preclude the deposition of its CEO, Dustin Edwards. The court has found that Edwards does not have unique and superior knowledge of the facts that cannot be obtained by less intrusive means. The motion is granted, and the deposition of Edwards is precluded. The court has also denied the motion to compel the deposition of Edwards filed by the plaintiff, Jesse Silk. The parties are reminded that there is an OSC re: appointment of a discovery referee on calendar on 10/23/24, and they are advised to work together to resolve the outstanding issues to avoid the appointment of a referee.
