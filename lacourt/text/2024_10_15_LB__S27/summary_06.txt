Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in plain English:

The judge has reviewed the motion filed by Defendant's attorney, Alexander J. Petale, to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Sophany Khov. The motion was filed on September 20, 2024, and the judge has denied it for two reasons. First, the attorney confirmed the client's address on August 1, 2024, but did not file the motion until September 20, 2024, which is more than 30 days later. Second, the motion is set to be heard very close to the trial date, which is scheduled for November 18, 2024.

The judge has also noted that attorneys do not have an absolute right to withdraw from representation at any time, and must comply with the procedures set forth in California Rule of Professional Conduct (CRPC) 3-700. The judge has ordered Defendant's attorney to continue representation on the matter until further notice.

The court has also taken the hearing on the motion off calendar and will not hear it on October 15, 2024. Parties who intend to submit on the tentative must send an email to the court indicating their intention to do so.
