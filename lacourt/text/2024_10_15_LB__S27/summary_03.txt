And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to vacate the dismissal of their action against the defendant. The plaintiff's original motion was filed on December 18, 2023, and was denied on February 27, 2024, after the plaintiff failed to appear at the hearing. The plaintiff has now filed a renewed motion, which the court has denied as it does not present any new facts, circumstances, or law. The court has also denied the plaintiff's request to vacate the dismissal under Code of Civil Procedure section 473(b).
