S27 8:30 a.m. October 15, 2024Moving Party: Plaintiff, Jennifer GeanOpposing Party: Defendant, FCA US LLCNotice: OK1. Background FactsPlaintiff, Jennifer Gean filed this action against Defendant, FCA US LLC for violation of the Song-Beverly Act.2. Motion to Compel Further Responsesa. RPD 10RPD 10 seeks production of a workshop manual. Defendant objected on various grounds. Plaintiff moves to compel a further response.The burden to justify an objection to a discovery request is on the party asserting the objection. See Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 22 Cal.4th 245, 255. Defendant, in its opposing separatestatement, includes substantial verbiage in connection with each RPD that has nothing to do with the individual RPD at issue; the point of a separate statement is to support the objections to each individual request, not to re-state generalized arguments over and over. Defendant’s only meaningful argument in opposition to the motion to compel a further response to RPD 10, specifically, is that Plaintiff can obtain the necessary information through an online subscription, for which Defendant will provide the link. It is unclear whether this is a paid subscription or not. In any event, availability to Plaintiff was not one of the objections interposed to the RPD.Defendant does not attempt to justify the objections actually interposed, and therefore all objections are overruled. Defendant must serve a supplemental response to the RPD without objections.b. RPD 16, 19, 58, 59, 61, and 62Defendant served supplemental responses after Plaintiff filed this motion. Defendant contends, pursuant to its supplemental responses, it has agreed to produce all responsive documents and the motion to compel is moot.Plaintiff, in reply, contends the motion is not moot as to RPD 16 because the supplemental response does not indicate Defendant will comply “in full.” Defendant must supplement its response to clarify. Plaintiff contends the motion is not moot as to the other RPDs because Defendant has not produced documents despite indicating it would do so. A motion to compel compliance is a separate motion, governed by CCP §2031.320, and is not ripe for hearing. The Court notes that parties often do not provide all documents at the same time that they provide responses.The parties must meet and confer forthwith to agree on a date for production of all responsive documents.c. SanctionsNo party seeks sanctions in connection with the motion, and none are imposed.Plaintiff is ordered to give notice.Parties who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the court at gdcdepts27@lacourt.org indicating intention to submit on the tentative as directed by the instructions provided on the court website at www.lacourt.org. If the department does not receive an email indicating the parties are submitting on the tentative and there are no appearances at the hearing, the motion may be placed off calendar. If a party submits on the tentative, the party’s email must include the case number and must identify the party submitting on the tentative. If the parties do not submit on the tentative, they should arrange to appear remotely.DATED: October 15, 2024 _____________________________________MARK C. KIM Judge of the Superior Court
