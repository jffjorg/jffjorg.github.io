And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Alcantar and Gascon v. Gene Rotondo, Timothy Moriarty, James Weiser, and Jerome Chiaro, regarding a motion for attorneys' fees. The motion was filed by Alcantar and Gascon, who seek to recover all attorneys' fees expended in connection with the action. The opposing parties, Gene Rotondo, Timothy Moriarty, James Weiser, and Jerome Chiaro, contend that the moving parties improperly include fees incurred in connection with the federal action and a prior state action, and that all claims that were included in those actions were ultimately dismissed.

The Judge has reviewed the pleadings and found that the fees incurred by Jerry Steering were incurred in connection with various federal and state law theories, none of which was civil theft. The Judge has also found that the civil theft claim carries with it an attorneys' fees penalty, and therefore only fees incurred in prosecuting the civil theft claim can be recovered.

The Judge has granted the motion for fees in the reduced amount of $214,418, which includes the fees incurred by Peter Freeman in connection with the civil theft claim. The Judge has also ordered that the judgment be amended to include the fees.
