S27 8:30 a.m. October 15, 2024Moving Party: Plaintiff, Shirin El SharkawiOpposing Party: Defendants, Kelvin Anderson, Sr. and World Famous VIP Records, LLCNotice: OK1. Background FactsPlaintiff, Shirin El Sharkawi filed this action against Defendants, Kelvin Anderson, Sr. and Rhone Love, as well as Nominal Defendant, World Famous VIP Records, LLC for breach of contract and related claims. Plaintiff filed the original complaint on 2/27/23. After multiple rounds of demurrers, Plaintiff’s operative complaint is her Third Amended Complaint, which she filed on 6/21/24. The TAC includes causes of action for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, tortious interference with contract, fraud, unjust enrichment, negligence, conversion, conversion (derivative), accounting, and breach of fiduciary duty. Defendants have a demurrer to the TAC pending for hearing on 12/03/24.2. Motion for Summary JudgmentPlaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment on 11/13/23. The motion is summarily denied for three reasons.First, when Plaintiff filed her motion, her operative pleading was her FAC, which she filed on 5/17/23. The pleadings serve as the “outer measure of materiality” in a summary judgment motion, and the motion may not be granted or denied on issues not raised by the pleadings. Laabs v. City of Victorville (2008) 163 CA4th 1242, 1258. Because Plaintiff’s TAC is now her operative complaint, and because her summary judgment motion is directed at her FAC, the motion cannot be granted.Second, both Plaintiff’s FAC and her operative TAC include ten causes of action. Plaintiff’s moving brief, however, addresses only the first and second causes of action. The motion is styled as one for summary judgment, not summary adjudication. The Court cannot grant summary judgment on ten causes of action when only two causes of action are addressed.Third, Paramount Petroleum v. Superior Court (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 226 holds that a plaintiff seeking summary judgment must prove up an amount of damages, as damages are an element of the cause of action. Put differently, if the trial court grants a summary judgment motion, then judgment must be entered. A judgment cannot be entered without an amount. If the amount is in dispute, a trial is still necessary to determine the amount, and therefore summary judgment cannot result in entry of judgment.For each of the above reasons, the motion is denied.The parties are reminded that there is a Case Management Conference on calendar today concurrently with the hearing on the above motion. The Court asks Counsel to make arrangements to appear remotely at the CMC and hearing on the motion.DATED: October 15, 2024 _____________________________________MARK C. KIM Judge of the Superior Court
