The court finds that the motions are moot in part, as plaintiff has already provided the requested responses and production. However, the court grants sanctions in part, finding that plaintiff's counsel was not entirely justified in their delay in responding to discovery. The court awards $1,200 in sanctions to defendant Bye Bye House, Inc.
