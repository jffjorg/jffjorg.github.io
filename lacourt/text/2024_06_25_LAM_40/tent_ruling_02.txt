 [TENTATIVE] RULING RE:
Plaintiff Akhenaton
  Rey Taylor’s Motion for Leave to Amend [Res ID # 6781].



 
I. Background
A. Relevant Procedural History
On October 27, 2023, Plaintiff Akhenaton Rey Taylor filed an in pro per,
one-page Complaint suing “Police Officer Cardiel (43005) / Kang (41473)” pursuant
to a claim of Police Misconduct 18 U.S.C. 242 Violation 1983.
On December 20, 26, and 28, 2023, Plaintiff Taylor filed proofs of
service reflecting service of the summons and Complaint on Officer Cardiel on
those dates.
The record fails to reflect service of the summons and Complaint on
Officer “Kang (41473).”
On February 21, 2024, Plaintiff Taylor filed an amendment to complaint
form seeking to name “DAR DOES” as “Curren D. Price Jr.”
On February 23, 2024, Plaintiff Taylor filed an amendment to complaint
form seeking to name “John Doe” as “Curren D. Price Jr.”
On March 1, 2024, the Court issued an order rejecting the amendments
because the Complaint does not allege any Doe Defendants.
B. Motion Before the Court
On March 15, 2024, Plaintiff Taylor filed a motion for leave to amend the
Complaint. The contents of Plaintiff’s motion appear to show the proposed
language for a First Amended Complaint more so than arguments and authorities
in favor of leave to amend. 
On May 2, 2024, Officer Cardiel filed a notice of non-opposition in
response to Plaintiff Taylor’s motion.
On May 21, 2024, at a hearing on different matters, the Court noted that
Plaintiff Taylor’s motion “is not necessary since the defendant did not file an
Answer to the complaint and ha[s] agreed to plaintiff filing a First Amended
Complaint.”
Plaintiff’ Taylor’s motion is now before the Court.
 
II. Motion for Leave to Amend: DENIED.
A. Relevant Law
A party may amend its pleading once
without leave of the court at any time before the answer, demurrer, or motion
to strike is filed. (Code Civ. Proc., § 472, subd. (a).)
B. Court’s Determination
Here, as noted by the Court on May
21, 2024, no Answer to the Complaint by Officer Cardiel appears in the record.
Officer Kang has not been served. Thus, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 472, subdivision (a), Plaintiff Taylor may amend the Complaint as a
matter of right. (5/21/24 Order, p. 1 [Plaintiff
Taylor’s motion “is not necessary since the defendant did not file an Answer to
the complaint and ha[s] agreed to plaintiff filing a First Amended Complaint”].)

However, the Court cannot grant
this motion because no proposed first amended complaint has been attached to
the motion, or separately lodged, as required by California Rule of Court, rule
3.1324. The assertions in the motion as to plaintiff’s elaboration on the facts
he is complaining about do not take the place of a pleading. This is not a mere
technicality – without such a proposed first amended complaint, the Court cannot
tell what is being proposed to be filed, and cannot determine the answers to the
basic questions of 1) who are the defendants; 2) what causes of action are
being asserted against each one; 3) what are the facts that support each cause
of action; and 4) what are the damages that are being sought against each defendant
under each cause of action. 
Therefore, the Court will DENY the
motion as pleaded. However, Plaintiff is advised that he may, without needing
to file another motion, file a First Amended Complaint, and may use the form PLD-PI-001
or other form complaint, and attach one or more causes of action (PLD-PI-001(2)
or (3)). 
III. Conclusion
Plaintiff Akhenaton Rey Taylor’s Motion for Leave to Amend [Res ID #
6781] is DENIED. Plaintiff may however, file a First Amended Complaint as of
right so long as it is done before any Defendant files an Answer or other
responsive pleading, like a demurrer. Plaintiff is referred to the LA Law
Library for assistance.
