And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English:

The judge has ruled on the plaintiff's motion to recover expenses incurred in serving defendants, including reasonable attorney fees and filing fees. The motion was denied as to Defendant Emmanuel University, Inc. because the attorney who was served, Daniel Cohen, was not authorized to accept service on behalf of Emmanuel University. The plaintiff argued that Emmanuel University waived its objections by failing to object to the improper service, but the court found insufficient merit to this argument. The court relied on a previous case, Laboratory Specialists Internat., Inc. v. Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Inc. (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 755, 761, which held that a failure to object to an improper service is a forfeiture, not a waiver. Since Emmanuel University filed a timely motion to quash challenging the exercise of jurisdiction over it, it has invoked its right to object to the proceedings and therefore no forfeiture or waiver can apply.
