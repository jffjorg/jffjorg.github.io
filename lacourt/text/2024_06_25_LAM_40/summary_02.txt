And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling on Plaintiff Akhenaton Rey Taylor's Motion for Leave to Amend the Complaint. The Court notes that Plaintiff may amend the Complaint as a matter of right due to Officer Cardiel's failure to file an Answer to the Complaint. However, the Court cannot grant the motion because no proposed First Amended Complaint has been attached to the motion or separately lodged as required by California Rule of Court, rule 3.1324. The Court will deny the motion as pleaded, but advises Plaintiff that they may file a First Amended Complaint without needing to file another motion.
