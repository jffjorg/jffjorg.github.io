And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The judge has overruled the defendant's evidentiary objections and denied the motion for summary judgment. The judge found that the plaintiff's expert, Dr. Lee, provided a sufficiently supported opinion that the defendant's acts and omissions caused the plaintiff's injuries. The judge determined that the defendant failed to show that Dr. Lee's declaration was without evidentiary support and that Dr. Lee's opinion was admissible and reliable. The judge also found that the defendant's argument that the plaintiff's injuries were caused by a failure to conduct a wound culture was unfounded, as Dr. Lee's declaration provided a clear explanation of the events that led to the plaintiff's injuries. The judge concluded that there are triable issues of fact and that the case should proceed to trial.
