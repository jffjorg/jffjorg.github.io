And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Mejia v. Campione, addressing several issues. Firstly, the judge rules that Campione's cross-complaint for indemnity and contribution from co-defendant Woo will proceed, despite Woo's demurrer. The judge finds that the cross-complaint is not duplicative of Campione's answer and that the possibility of damages being apportioned in the main action does not preclude the cross-claims from proceeding. Additionally, the judge rules that Campione's request for attorney's fees is proper and that Woo's argument that the right to indemnification does not arise unless a legal obligation exists to the injured party is improper on demurrer.

Secondly, the judge grants the motions to compel responses to written discovery, finding that Campione and Woo served discovery requests on plaintiff Mejia, but received no responses. The judge also awards sanctions to both parties, with Campione receiving $720 and Woo receiving $900. The hourly rates of $215 and $300 per hour are reasonable, but the eight hours of work claimed by Woo is excessive.
