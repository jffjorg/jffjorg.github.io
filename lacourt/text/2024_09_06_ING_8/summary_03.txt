As for the summary in English text:

The tentative ruling of the court is that the motions to compel responses to the discovery requests, including Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories, and Requests for Production of Documents, are mooted by the defendant's belated service of written responses while the motions were pending. The court finds that the plaintiff was forced to bring these motions after the defendant failed to timely provide any written responses, and therefore, monetary sanctions are warranted. The court will set a future hearing to allow the parties to resolve the objections and sanctions issues themselves.
