I. BACKGROUND¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
A. Factual¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿ 
On May 14, 2021, Plaintiff,
David Zeil (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Defendants DOES 1 through
100. Plaintiff eventually learned of the identity of more Defendants including
Southwest Airlines Co, and Ms. Manu. The Complaint alleges causes of action
for: (1) Products Liability; and (2) General Negligence. 
 
Because the Court addressed a
similar discovery motion yesterday and posted a detailed tentative ruling, this
tentative will be truncated.  
 
On May 1, 2024, Plaintiff
contends that he served Requests for Admission, Set Two, Corresponding Form
Interrogatory No. 17.1, and Inspection Demands, Set Two.   Plaintiff
states that Defendant, Southwest Airlines Co.’s (“Defendant”) responses were
due on or before June 5,  but no
responses were provided by Defendant.  Instead, defense counsel asked for a two-week
extension to respond to discovery.  A
dispute arose as to conditions to be imposed on the requested extension because
of the pendency at that time of the defense motion for summary judgment and Plaintiff’s
desire to obtain the responses before the deadline to file opposition tot the
MSJ.  The parties failed to resolve the
dispute over condition so on June 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed motions to compel
responses to the May 1 discovery.  The parties
agree that belated responses were served on June 24, 2024, while the discovery motions
were pending.  
 
            At the hearing on July 18, 2024, this Court granted
Plaintiff’s request for discovery sanctions but found the rest of the motion
mooted by Defendant’s further discovery responses.  Plaintiff asserts that Defendant’s proposal
regarding the further responses did not address the issues noted in Plaintiff’s
June 24, 2024 meet and confer letter. Since that hearing, Plaintiff contends
that Defendant has not provided the above promised further responses to
Plaintiff. 
 
Thus,
Plaintiff has filed this Motion to Compel Defendant’s Further Responses to Inspection
Demand No. 56.
 
B. Procedural¿¿¿ 
¿¿ 
On August 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed this
Motion to Compel Further Responses to Inspection Demand No. 56. On August 26,
2024, Defendant filed an opposition brief as to both motions. On August 26,
2024, Plaintiff filed a reply brief.  
 
II. ANALYSIS¿¿ 
 
A.    Legal Standard 
 
 A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd. (a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide timely responses, the requesting
party may move for an order compelling responses to the discovery. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) The party also waives the right to make any
objections, including one based on privilege or work-product protection. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) There is no time limit for a motion to
compel responses to interrogatories other than the cut-off on hearing discovery
motions 15 days before trial. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (a); Code
Civ. Proc., 2030.290.) No meet and confer efforts are required before filing a
motion to compel responses to the discovery. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290; Sinaiko
Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148
Cal.App.4th 390, 411.)
 
B.   
Discussion
 
As noted in this Court’s
previous minute order regarding Form Interrogatory 17.1 and Motion to Deem
Requests for Admission as Admitted, Defendant’s opposition brief confirms that
prior to the filing of the opposition, Defendant submitted its unqualified
admissions to each and every Request that is subject to the Motion, thereby
negating the Inspection Demand and Form Interrogatory No. 17.1 corresponding to
said Requests for Admission, and mooting all motions. The Court notes that this
is true, but only as to the substantive portions of the motion. Because
Defendant confirms that the responses only came after the filing of the motion,
the costs of Plaintiff filing the motion were still taken on by Plaintiff in
order to get said responses/admissions. As such, the Requests for Monetary
Sanctions are not mooted. 
 
C.   
Sanctions 
 
Because the untimely, but substantially Code-compliant admissions
and denial were served prior to the hearing of this motion, the substantive
motion to deem the RFAs admitted is mooted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2033.280(a).)
However, this does not moot Plaintiff’s request for sanctions. 
 
This Court again notes that a party should not be required to
resort to a motion to compel in order to obtain discovery responses from an
opposing party.  Since the parties argued
monetary sanctions issues as to yesterday’s motions, the Court is well
acquainted with the arguments on both sides. 
Taking into account the monetary sanctions the Court ordered on September
5,  the Court orders Defendant and/or its
counsel to pay monetary sanctions to Plaintiff’s counsel in the amount of $1,000,
plus the $68.40 filing fee, for total monetary sanctions on this motion alone of
$1,068.40, payable to Plaintiff’s counsel within thirty (30) days. 
 
III. CONCLUSION 
 
For
the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Further Responses to Inspection
Demand No. 56 is substantively MOOTED. However, the Court awards Plaintiff’s
request for monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,068.40. 
 
Plaintiff
is ordered to give notice.
