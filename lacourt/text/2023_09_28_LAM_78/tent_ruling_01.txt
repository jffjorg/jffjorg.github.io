Plaintiffs allege Defendants T.N.L. Construction Inc. (“T.N.L. Construction”), and TNL Renovation Inc. (“TNL Renovation”), to whom T.N.L. Construction assigned its rights and duties pursuant to a novation, negligently performed construction on their home, leading to structural damage and delays.  PROCEDURAL HISTORY On March 30, 2020, Plaintiffs filed the Complaint asserting five causes of action: 1. Negligence; 2. Breach of Written Contract; 3. Unjust Enrichment; 4. Violation of Business and Professions Code Section 7031; and 5. Claim on Construction Bonds. On May 29, 2020, T.N.L. Construction demurred to the Complaint. That Demurrer was overruled.  On November 17, 2020, T.N.L. Construction Inc. filed a Cross-Complaint asserting six causes of action: 1. Comparative Indemnity and Apportionment of Fault; 2. Total Equitable Indemnity; 3. Negligence; 4. Breach of Contract; 5. Implied Contractual indemnity; and,  6. Declaratory Relief.  On January 15, 2021, Cross-Defendant EHD Builders Inc. filed a Demurrer to T.N.L. Construction’s Cross-Complaint. That Demurrer was sustained with leave to amend.  On February 3, 2021, TNL Renovation filed a Cross-Complaint asserting four causes of action: 1. Express Contractual Indemnity; 2. Implied Indemnity; 3. Contribution and Apportionment; and  4. Declaratory Relief On July 21, 2021, T.N.L. Construction filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint.  On August 3, 2021, TNL Renovation filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint.  On November 3, 2021, TNL Renovation filed a Second Amended Cross-Complaint.  On June 15, 2022, TNL Renovation filed a Third Amended Cross-Complaint.  On September 6, 2022, TNL Renovation filed a Fourth Amended Cross-Complaint.  On November 4, 2022, Movants filed a Notice of Stay of Proceedings due to bankruptcy.  On December 12, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Entry of Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion for Relief from Automatic Stay.  On July 19, 2023, TNL Construction, Meir Levi, and Tomer Levi filed their First Amended Answer to Plaintiffs’ Complaint.On August 1, 2023, Plaintiffs filed the instant demurrer to the First Amended Answer (“FAA”) filed by Defendants TNL Construction, Inc., Meir Levi, and Tomer Levi (collectively “Levi Defendants”).DISCUSSION Plaintiffs demur to the 23rd affirmative defense in the Levi Defendants’ FAA on the grounds that it contains no facts alleging Plaintiffs and Defendants reached a novation. Additionally, Plaintiffs argue that the affirmative defense only applies to Plaintiffs’ claim for breach of contract.Within ten (10) days of service of an answer, a party against whom an answer has been filed may object by demurrer.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.40.)  Unlike a demurrer to a complaint or cross-complaint, a demurrer to an answer is limited to three grounds:   (a) The answer does not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense;  (b) The answer is uncertain; or  (c) Where the answer pleads a contract, it cannot be ascertained from the answer whether the contract is written or oral.   (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20.)  A verified complaint must be denied positively or according to information and belief.  A general denial is effective to controvert all material allegations of an unverified complaint.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 431.30, subd. (d).)  Anything less than a general denial of the whole complaint is a “qualified” or “specific” denial.  A defendant can direct his or her denials to specific sentences, paragraphs, of parts of the complaint.  Although not widely used, a defendant can also effectively deny allegations in the complaint by alleging contrary or inconsistent facts. In addition to denials, the answer should contain any and all affirmative defenses or objections to the complaint that defendant may have, and that would otherwise not be in issue under a simple denial.  Such defenses or objections are “new matter.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 431.30, subd. (b).)  Generally, a defendant bears the burden of proving “new matter” and, as such, must be specifically pleaded in the answer.  (California Academy of Sciences v. County of Fresno (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1436, 1442.)  “The phrase ‘new matter’ refers to something relied on by a defendant which is not put in issue by the plaintiff.”  (Walsh v. West Valley Mission Community College District (1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1532, 1546; see also Cahil Bros., Inc. v. Clementina Co. (1962) 208 Cal.App.2d 367, 385 [“The basic consideration is whether the matters of defense are responsive to the essential allegations of the complaint, i.e., whether they are contradicting elements of plaintiff’s cause of action or whether they tender a new issue, in which case the burden of proof is upon the defendant as to the allegation constituting such new matter.”].)  Where the answer sets forth facts showing some essential allegation of the complaint is not true, such facts are not new matter but are denials.  (Ibid.; see also Statefarm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 721, 725 [holding a matter negating an essential allegation in the complaint does not constitute a new matter, and therefore, need not be specifically pled by the defendant].)    The same pleading of “ultimate facts” rather than evidentiary matter or legal conclusions is required as in pleading a complaint.  The answer must aver facts as carefully and with as much detail as the facts which constitute the cause of action and which are alleged in the complaint.  (FPI Development, Inc. v. Nakashimi (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 384.)  The various affirmative defenses must be separately stated and must refer to the causes of action to which they relate “in a manner by which they may be intelligently distinguished.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 431.30(g).)  Defenses must be pleaded in the nature of “yes, the allegations [of the complaint] are true, but . . .”  (FPI Development, Inc., supra, 231 Cal.App.3d at p. 383.)Here, Plaintiffs demur to the Levi Defendants’ 23rd affirmative defense. The Levi Defendants argue in opposition that (1) the demurrer fails to comply with Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1320(a) and (2) the Answer states sufficient facts to support its 23rd affirmative defense because the Levi Defendants are not asserting new matters which would require a more specific pleading of facts. The FAA states:“As a separate and twenty-third affirmative defense to the Complaint and each purported cause of action contained therein, defendants allege that a novation was reached between Plaintiffs and Defendants such that the contract upon which Plaintiffs are suing Defendants under has been extinguished. (Civ.Code, §§ 1530, 1531; Tufeld Corporation v. Beverly Hills Gateway, L.P. (2022) 86 Cal.App.5th 12, 29; Alexander v. Angel (1951) 37 Cal.2d 856, 862.)”“‘Novation is the substitution of a new obligation for an existing one.’”  (Wells Fargo Bank v. Bank of America (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 424, 431 (quoting Civ. Code, § 1530).)  “The substitution is by agreement and with the intent to extinguish the prior obligation.”  (Id.)  “The substitution of a new obligation for an existing one may be either (1) a new obligation between the same parties, or (2) a new obligation arising because of new parties, either a new debtor or new creditor.”  (Id.)  “‘Novation is made by contract and is subject to all the rules concerning contracts in general.’”  (Id. (quoting Civ. Code, § 1532).)  “A novation thus amounts to a new contract which supplants the original agreement and ‘completely extinguishes the original obligation . . ..’”  (Id.)  “It must ‘‘clearly appear’ that the parties intended to extinguish rather than merely modify the original agreement.’”  (Id. at 432 (quoting Howard v. County of Amador (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 962, 977).) Here, the Levi Defendants’ answer states that the parties reached a novation and the contract Plaintiffs are suing under has been extinguished. The allegation that the parties reached a novation that extinguished their previous contract is an ultimate fact sufficient to state an affirmative defense for novation. Plaintiffs’ demurrer to the Levi Defendants’ FAA is overruled.DATED: September 28, 2023 ____________________________Hon. Jill FeeneyJudge of the Superior Court
