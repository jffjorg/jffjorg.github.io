  - "The substitution of a new obligation for an existing one may be either (1) a new obligation between the same parties, or (2) a new obligation arising because of new parties, either a new debtor or new creditor."
  - "A novation thus amounts to a new contract which supplants the original agreement and ‘completely extinguishes the original obligation . . ..’"
  - "It must ‘‘clearly appear’ that the parties intended to extinguish rather than merely modify the original agreement.’"
```

Summary: The judge has ruled on the Plaintiffs' demurrer to the First Amended Answer filed by the Levi Defendants. The Levi Defendants alleged that a novation was reached between the parties, which extinguished the original contract. The judge has overruled the demurrer, finding that the allegation of novation is an ultimate fact sufficient to state an affirmative defense.
