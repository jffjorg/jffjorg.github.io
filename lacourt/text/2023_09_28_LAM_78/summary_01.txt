As a result, the Judge overrules the Plaintiff's demurrer.

And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by the Plaintiffs, Fung Bark Lau and Yang He, to the First Amended Answer filed by the Levi Defendants, TNL Construction Inc., Meir Levi, and Tomer Nahum Levi. The Plaintiffs argue that the Levi Defendants' 23rd affirmative defense, which alleges that a novation was reached between the parties, is not supported by facts and is therefore insufficient to state an affirmative defense. The Levi Defendants argue that their answer states sufficient facts to support their 23rd affirmative defense.

The Judge has found that the Levi Defendants' answer states an ultimate fact sufficient to state an affirmative defense for novation, which is that the parties reached a novation that extinguished their previous contract. The Judge has therefore overruled the Plaintiffs' demurrer to the Levi Defendants' First Amended Answer.

```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has overruled the plaintiffs' demurrer to the defendants' First Amended Answer. The plaintiffs had argued that the defendants' 23rd affirmative defense, which alleged that a novation had been reached between the parties, was insufficient because it did not state facts alleging that the plaintiffs and defendants had reached a novation. However, the judge found that the defendants' answer stated sufficient facts to support their affirmative defense of novation, and that the plaintiffs' demurrer was therefore overruled. The judge noted that a novation is a substitution of a new obligation for an existing one, and that the defendants' answer alleged that the parties had reached a novation that extinguished their previous contract. The judge also noted that the defendants bore the burden of proving their affirmative defense, and that the plaintiffs' demurrer did not comply with the California Rules of Court. The judge's ruling means that the defendants' affirmative defense of novation will be allowed to proceed, and that the plaintiffs will need to respond to this defense in their subsequent filings.

This is a tentative ruling for a case regarding construction defects in a home owned by Plaintiffs Fung Bark Lau and Yang He. Defendants TNL Construction Inc., TNL Renovation Inc., Meir Levi, and Tomer Nahum Levi are accused of negligently performing construction on the home, causing structural damage and delays. The Plaintiffs filed a demurrer to the First Amended Answer filed by Defendants TNL Construction, Meir Levi, and Tomer Levi.

The Judge has found that this allegation is an ultimate fact sufficient to state an affirmative defense for novation.
