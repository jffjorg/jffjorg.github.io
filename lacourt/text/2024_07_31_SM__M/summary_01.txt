And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has reviewed the demurrer to the complaint and has found that the Plaintiff's complaint for declaratory relief is properly before the Court. The Judge has rejected the Defendant's argument that the lawsuit is not ripe for declaratory relief, finding that the Plaintiff's complaint complies with established case law's requirement that an attorney bring an independent action against their former client to establish the validity of an attorney fees lien. The Judge has also rejected the Defendant's argument that the lawsuit is barred because the Plaintiff did not bring an independent action against the former client to establish the validity of the attorney fees lien, finding that the Plaintiff's complaint is a separate and independent action from the underlying action in which the subject fees were incurred. Finally, the Judge has denied the motion for sanctions, finding that the Plaintiff's complaint was not frivolous.
