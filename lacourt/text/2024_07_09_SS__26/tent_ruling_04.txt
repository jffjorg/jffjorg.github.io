ANALYSIS:
 
On March 26, 2023,
Plaintiff I.L.W.U. Credit Union (“Plaintiff”) filed this action for
breach of contract against Defendant Andre T. Thomas (“Defendant”). Defendant
filed an answer on November 17, 2023. On April 10, 2024, the Court granted
Plaintiff’s motion to deem requests for admission admitted and request for
monetary sanctions. (Minute Order, 04/10/24.) 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings against Defendant on May 13, 2024. No
opposition to the Motion has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
The standard for ruling on a
motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that applicable
to a general demurrer, that is, under the state of the pleadings, together with
matters that may be judicially noticed, it appears that a party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.  (Bezirdjian
v. O'Reilly (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 316, 321-322, citing Schabarum v.
California Legislature (1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216.)  Matters which are subject to mandatory
judicial notice may be treated as part of the complaint and may be considered
without notice to the parties. Matters which are subject to permissive judicial
notice must be specified in the notice of motion, the supporting points and
authorities, or as the court otherwise permits. (Id.)  The motion may not be supported by extrinsic
evidence. (Barker v. Hull (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 221, 236.)
 
While a statutory motion for
judgment on the pleadings brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
438, et seq. must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration, there is no
such requirement for a motion for judgment on the pleadings brought pursuant to
the common law. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 439 [moving party must file declaration
demonstrating an attempt to meet and confer in person or by telephone, at least
five days before the date a motion for judgment on the pleadings is filed].) 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion is accompanied
by a request for judicial notice of the matters deemed admitted in Plaintiff’s
Motion to Deem Requests for Admission, Set One, Admitted, pursuant to this
Court’s April 10, 2024 order. The Court takes judicial notice of these facts
pursuant to Cal. Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (d). (Cal. Evid. Code,
§ 452, subd. (d); Cloud v. Northrop Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th
995, 999; Evans v. California Trailer Court, Inc. (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th
540, 549) [holding that the court may take judicial notice of matters that
cannot be reasonably controverted, including “admissions and concessions.”].) 
 
The admissions in the Request for
Admissions directly contradict the denials and affirmative defenses asserted in
Defendant’s Answer. The admissions admit that Defendant executed the September
29, 2021, Loanliner Loan and Security Agreements and Disclosure Statement. (Motion,
RJN, Exh. 3, Request for Admission No. 2.) They also admit that Defendant
agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of the September 29, 2021,
Loanliner Loan and Security Agreements but failed to make the installment
payment due on or about October 22, 2022, and all subsequent installments. (Id.
at Exh. 3, Request for Admission Nos. 3-4.) The admissions further admit that the
unpaid principal balance due and owing on the September 29, 2021, Loanliner
Loan and Security Agreements and Disclosure Statement is presently $15,190.47
and Defendant pledged one Hyundai Genesis, Vehicle Identification No.
KMHGN4IE4FU016944, as collateral but has not returned, and is no longer in
possession of the vehicle. (Id. at Exh. 3, Request for Admission Nos. 5-8.)
 
Next, Defendant admits they
submitted a Loanliner Express Application for a Visa Credit Card Account to
Plaintiff, pursuant to which Defendant maintained a Visa Credit Card Account. (Id.
at Exh. 3, Request for Admission, Nos. 11-13.) They further admit that in
consideration for Plaintiff, loaning and advancing money under the terms of the
Visa Credit Card Account Agreement, they agreed to repay the amounts so
advanced and Plaintiff relied on these terms to extend credit. (Id. at
Exh. 3, Request for Admission, Nos. 14-16.) Defendant admits they failed to
make the payment due on or about November 25, 2022, and all subsequent
installments, on the Visa Credit Card Account, and there is presently due and
owing $1,041.79. (Id. at Exh. 3, Request for Admissions, Nos. 16-18.)
Third, Defendant admits that interest accrues on the Visa Credit Card Account
at an annual rate of 12.95 percent and that both agreements contain attorney’s
fees provisions. (Id. at Exh. 3, Requests for Admission, Nos. 9, 19,
20.) Finally, Defendant admits they have no defense to the claims raised in the
Complaint. (Id. at Exh. 3, Request for Admission No. 24.)
 
By this Motion, Plaintiff has demonstrated that it served
Defendant with Requests for Admissions that effectively establish the truth of
the allegations in the Complaint, as detailed above. The admissions establish
the facts upon which Plaintiff based its Complaint and that Defendant has not
alleged a defense to Plaintiff’s Complaint in the Answer. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff I.L.W.U. Credit Union’s
Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings against Defendant Thomas T. Andre is GRANTED. PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE A PROPOSED
JUDGMENT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
