MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES(Civ.
Code § 1717; Code Civ. Proc., § 1032)
 

 
 
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Bill Davis Drywall,
Inc.’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT OF $12,420.00.
PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE AND SERVE A PROPOSED JUDGMENT WITHIN 20 DAYS OF THIS
ORDER.
 
 
ANALYSIS: 
 
On August
22, 2022, Plaintiff Bill Davis Drywall, Inc. (“Plaintiff”) filed this action
against Defendant Jeffrey Pink (“Defendant Pink”), Hartford Insurance Company
of the Midwest, (“Defendant Hartford”), and later added Navigators Insurance
Company (“Defendant Navigators”). Defendant Hartford was dismissed just one
month into the action. 
 
On
February 23, 2024, judgment was entered in favor of Plaintiff and against
Defendant Pink in the total amount of $33,609.44. Plaintiff dismissed Defendant
Navigators on March 19, 2024. 
 
Plaintiff filed
the instant Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs on March 28, 2024. No
opposition has been filed to date. 
 
Discussion
 
Timing of
Motion
 
Plaintiff brings the instant Motion pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1032, 1033.5 and Civil Code section 1717. A
prevailing party is entitled to recover costs, including attorneys’ fees when
authorized by contract, statute, or law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1032, subd.
(a)(4); § 1033.5, subd. (a)(10).) A motion for attorney’s fees must be filed
and served with the time for filing a notice of appeal under Cal. Rules of
Court Rule 8.822. (Cal. Rules of Court Rule 3.1702(a).) Cal. Rules of Court
Rule 8.822 states that an attorneys’ fees motion must be filed within the
earlier of (1) 30 days after the trial court clerk served the party filing the
motion with notice of entry of judgment; or (2) 90 days after entry of
judgment. (Cal. Rules of Court 8.822(1).) Here, the Motion is timely because no
notice of entry of judgment was served and the Motion was brought less than 90
days after entry of judgment. 
 
Prevailing Party
 
Plaintiff contends it is the prevailing party
in this action pursuant to Civil Code section 1717 as the party who
recovered greater relief in the action on the contract. (Civ. Code, § 1717,
subd. (b)(1).) This is undisputed based on Plaintiff prevailing in its breach
of contract action against Defendant Pink. The Court finds that Plaintiff is
accordingly entitled to an award of its attorney’s fees and costs. 
 
Amount of Attorney’s Fees
 
Plaintiff moves for an award of $12,420.00
in attorney’s fees billed at $300.00
per hour. (Motion, Devine Decl., ¶32.) The moving party bears the burden of
proof with respect to attorney’s fees. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1033.5, subd.
(c)(5)(A).) Specifically, a party seeking fees has the burden of showing
the fees incurred are “allowable,” are “reasonably necessary to the conduct of
the litigation,” and are “reasonable in amount.”  (Levy v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc.
(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 807, 816.)
 
The Court’s objective is to award attorney’s fees at the fair market value based
on the particular action. (Ketchum
v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1132.) “The reasonable
hourly rate is that prevailing in the community for similar work.” (PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000)
22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.) “‘[T]he fee setting inquiry in California
ordinarily begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate . . . .’” (Ketchum v.
Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1134.) 
The lodestar method is based on the
factors, as relevant to the particular case: “(1) the novelty and difficulty of
the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award.”  (Id. at 1132.) “The ‘‘experienced
trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in
his court, and while his judgment is of course
subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong.’’” (Id.) A negative modifier was appropriate
when duplicative work had been performed.
(Thayer v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 819.)
 
$300.00 per hour is a reasonable hourly rate
for a senior attorney in a limited breach of contract action. (Motion, Devine
Decl., ¶30.) The number of hours billed, 41.4, was also reasonable. This action
was filed in April 2022 and disposed of in February 2024. Over two years,
Plaintiff’s attorney drafted demand letters to Defendant Pink, drafted and
filed the Complaint, reviewed communications regarding the construction
project, communicated with representatives of the license surety bond about the
production of documents and a possible settlement, propounded discovery on
Defendant Pink and the license surety bond, drafted, filed and appeared for
discovery motions following Defendant Pink’s failure to respond, coordinated
with opposing counsel and prepared for trial, appeared for trial, prepared
post-trial filings, dismissed the license bond surety, and prepared and filed
the instant Motion. (Id. at ¶¶9-29 and Exh. D.) 
 
Accordingly,
the requested fees are reasonable and Plaintiff is awarded attorney’s fees of $12,420.00.
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff
Bill Davis Drywall, Inc.’s Motion for Attorney’s Fees is GRANTED IN THE AMOUNT
OF $12,420.00. PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE AND SERVE A PROPOSED JUDGMENT WITHIN 20
DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
