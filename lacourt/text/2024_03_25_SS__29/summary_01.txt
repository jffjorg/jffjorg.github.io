Significant Statements:
  - "To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing, may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse of the discovery process: ... (d) The court may impose a terminating sanction …." (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030)
  - "Misuses of the discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following: ... (d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. ... (g) Disobeying a court order to provide discovery." (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010)
  - "Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate with the misconduct, and they 'should not exceed that which is required to protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.'" (Doppes v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992)
  - "A terminating sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective." (Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 566, 604)
  - "The primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil Discovery Act and the Court's orders. It is not to punish." (Newland v. Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613)
  - "A discovery sanction should not create a 'windfall' for a party or place a party in a better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations under the Court's orders and the Civil Discovery Act." (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164, 1194)

And here is the English text summary:

The judge issues a tentative ruling denying the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions. The case arises from a vehicle accident that occurred on June 12, 2017, and the plaintiff filed a complaint on June 7, 2019. The defendant filed an answer on September 2, 2021, and the parties have been involved in a discovery dispute since then. The defendant requested terminating sanctions due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with discovery requests, failure to pay monetary sanctions, and reluctance to comply with obligations under the Civil Discovery Act. The judge notes that the plaintiff did not comply with a court order to serve discovery responses within 30 days and did not pay the ordered monetary sanctions. However, the judge finds that the defendant has not made a sufficient showing to warrant a terminating sanction, as there is no evidence of a history or pattern of willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by lesser sanctions. The judge also notes that a terminating sanction would create a "windfall" for the defendant. The motion is denied without prejudice to the defendant seeking other sanctions or seeking a terminating sanction at a later stage of the proceedings.
