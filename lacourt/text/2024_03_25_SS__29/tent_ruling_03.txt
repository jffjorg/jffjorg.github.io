 Case Number:  20STCV41357    Hearing Date:   March 25, 2024    Dept:  29 The Court will hear from counsel, including on the following  issues:   1.      1. Does the Privette doctrine apply?  If, as Plaintiff contends (and Defendant contests),  there was a dangerous condition present that caused Plaintiff’s injury, did Defendant  retain control over the gate?  What evidence  is there that Defendant did or did not delegate control over the gate to  Plaintiff’s employer?  If Plaintiff’s  employer had no control over the operation of the gate, does this case fall  within the Hooker exception?   2.      2. Assuming that Plaintiff was negligent in some  degree, what is it about these facts that should lead the Court to conclude that  this is not a case of comparative negligence but is instead, as a matter of  law, a case of primary assumption of the risk?   3.      3. Defendant argues that there was no dangerous  condition present and that, if there was, the dangerous condition was open and  obvious.  Defendant is certainly entitled  to argue in the alternative on summary judgment, but what basis is there in the  record for the Court to conclude, as a matter of law, that the dangerous  condition was so open and obvious that there was no duty to warn further.     4.      4. At the time of the accident, Plaintiff wanted to  close the gate – and Defendant presumably did not want the gate open (with its  valuable equipment inside) all night.   Plaintiff chose a manner of closing the gate that involved substantial  risk to him, but what better option did he have, based on the evidence in the record?
