Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the motion to continue trial filed by the plaintiff, Julia Mary Miller. The motion was filed on March 4, 2024, and no opposition was filed. The judge considered the factors set forth in California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(c) and (d), including the proximity of the trial date, the length of the continuance requested, and the availability of alternative means to address the problem that gave rise to the motion. The judge noted that the parties have not been able to complete discovery, including the deposition of the person most knowledgeable, and that the parties need time to engage in a settlement conference or mediation. The judge also noted that the plaintiff's trial attorney will be out of the country from May 13 to 27, 2024, and that the defendant has filed a motion for summary judgment, scheduled to be heard on February 28, 2025. The judge granted the motion to continue trial and advanced the trial date to early April 2025. The final status conference and all deadlines were reset based on the new trial date.
