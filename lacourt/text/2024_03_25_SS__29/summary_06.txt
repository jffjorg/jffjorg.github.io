And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to consolidate two cases, 21STCV41389 (Fransis Action) and 23STCV15023 (Altuntas Action), without prejudice. The plaintiff, Calvin Holland, alleges that he was involved in two motor vehicle accidents in 2020 and is seeking to consolidate the two cases for all purposes. The judge notes that the cases were deemed related on December 1, 2023, and that the Fransis Action is set for trial on April 19, 2024, while no trial date has been set in the Altuntas Action. The judge denies the motion due to a procedural defect, as the notice of motion was only filed in the Fransis Action and not the Altuntas Action. The motion is denied without prejudice, and the plaintiff is required to give notice to all counsel in both actions.
