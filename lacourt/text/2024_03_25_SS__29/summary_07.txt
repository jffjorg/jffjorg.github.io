Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Serajul Islam's motion to strike the punitive damages allegations against him in the Third Amended Complaint (TAC). The Court finds that the TAC fails to state facts with sufficient particularity to support a claim against Defendant Islam for the recovery of punitive damages. The Court has previously granted Plaintiff Abdus Samad leave to amend twice, but Plaintiff has still not pleaded a viable claim for punitive damages. The Court warns Plaintiff that this is his final opportunity to plead with adequate specificity and particularity.
