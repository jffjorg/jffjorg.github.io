 Case Number:  21STCV39716    Hearing Date:   March 25, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion to Continue Trial filed by Plaintiff Julia Mary  Miller.   Tentative The motion is   granted Background On October 28, 2021, Julia Mary Miller (“Plaintiff”)  filed the complaint against Terry Magady (“Defendant”), and Does 1 to 20 for Premises  Liability and Negligence causes of action arising from a trip and fall  occurring on November 10, 2019.   On March 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed  this motion to continue trial. No opposition has been filed.   Legal Standard Code Civ. Proc. § 128(a)(8) provides that the  court has the power to amend and control its process and orders so as to make  them conform to law and justice. “The power to determine when a continuance  should be granted is within the discretion of the trial court.” (Color-Vue,  Inc. v. Abrams (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1599, 1603.) “A trial court has wide  latitude in the matter of calendar control including the granting or denying of  continuances.” (Park Motors, Inc. v. Cozens (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 12, 18.)   Each request for a continuance must be  considered on its own merits according to California Rules of Court, Rule  3.1332(c). The court may grant a continuance only on an affirmative showing of  good cause requiring the continuance. Circumstances of good cause include:   “(1) The unavailability of an essential lay  or expert witness because of death, illness, or other excusable  circumstances;   (2) The unavailability of a party because of  death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;   (3) The unavailability of trial counsel  because of death, illness, or other excusable circumstances;   (4) The substitution of trial counsel, but  only where there is an affirmative showing that the substitution is required in  the interests of justice;   (5) The addition of a new party if: (A) The  new party has not had a reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery and prepare  for trial; or (B) The other parties have not had a reasonable opportunity to  conduct discovery and prepare for trial in regard to the new party's  involvement in the case;   (6) A party's excused inability to obtain  essential testimony, documents, or other material evidence despite diligent  efforts; or   (7) A significant, unanticipated change in  the status of the case as a result of which the case is not ready for  trial.”   (Cal. Rules of  Court, Rule 3.1332(c).)     California Rules  of Court, Rule 3.1332 sets forth a list of non-exhaustive factors to be  analyzed when determining whether good cause for a trial continuance is  present. A court considers factors such as:    “(1) The proximity of the trial date;   (2) Whether there was any previous  continuance, extension of time, or delay of trial due to any party;   (3) The length of the continuance  requested;   (4) The availability of alternative means to  address the problem that gave rise to the motion or application for a  continuance;   (5) The prejudice that parties or witnesses  will suffer as a result of the continuance;  (6) If the case is entitled to a preferential  trial setting, the reasons for that status and whether the need for a  continuance outweighs the need to avoid delay;  (7) The court's calendar and the impact of  granting a continuance on other pending trials;  (8) Whether trial counsel is engaged in  another trial;   (9) Whether all parties have stipulated to a  continuance;   (10) Whether the interests of justice are  best served by a continuance, by the trial of the matter, or by imposing  conditions on the continuance; and   (11) Any other fact or circumstance relevant  to the fair determination of the motion or application.”   (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1332(d).)  Discussion Plaintiff contends there is good cause to continue trial as (1) the  parties have not been able to complete discovery, including the deposition of  the person most knowledgeable; (2) the parties need time to engage in a  settlement conference or mediation, but after depositions are completed; (3)  Plaintiff’s trial attorney will be out of the country from May 13 to 27, 2024;  and (4) Defendant has filed a motion for summary judgment, scheduled to be  heard on February 28, 2025. (Motion, 3:3-13.) Defendant’s motion for summary judgment was filed on January 19, 2024.  Trial is currently set for May 14, 2024. The parties have signed a written stipulation for the trial  continuance. “A trial court may not refuse to hear a summary judgment  motion filed within the time limits of section 437c.” (Sentry Ins. Co. v.  Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529; accord Cole v. Superior  Court (2022) 87 Cal.App.5th 84, 88.)  Accordingly, the motion to continue trial is GRANTED. Conclusion The Motion to  Continue Trial is GRANTED.  The trial date  is advanced and continued to early April 2025.   Final Status Conference and all deadlines are reset based on the new  trial date.Final Status Conference is continued to 03/20/2025 at 10:00 AM in Department 29 at Spring
