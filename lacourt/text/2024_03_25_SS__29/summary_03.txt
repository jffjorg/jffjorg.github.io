And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge will hear arguments from both sides on several issues at the upcoming hearing. The first issue is whether the Privette doctrine applies, which would mean that the defendant had control over the gate and is liable for the plaintiff's injury. The judge will also consider whether the plaintiff was negligent in some degree, and if so, whether this is a case of primary assumption of the risk rather than comparative negligence. The defendant argues that there was no dangerous condition present, but the judge will need to consider whether the condition was open and obvious, and whether the defendant had a duty to warn further. Finally, the judge will consider the plaintiff's decision to close the gate in a way that involved substantial risk, and whether the plaintiff had any better options based on the evidence in the record.
