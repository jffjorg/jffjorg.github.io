  Case Number:  19STCV19943    Hearing Date:   March 25, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendants’ Motion for Terminating Sanctions
 
Tentative
The motion is denied.
Background
This case arises out of an
alleged vehicle accident that occurred on or about June 12, 2017, near the
intersection of Temple Avenue and Diamond Bar Boulevard.  On June 7, 2019, Plaintiff Tamara Abdelgainy
(“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Defendants Tedocio Borja Mendoza, Anthony
Torres Demolition Corp. (collectively, “Defendants”), and Does 1 through 50
asserting causes of action for Negligence, Negligence Per Se, Vicarious
Liability, Negligent Entrustment of a Motor Vehicle, and Negligent Hiring,
Retention, Supervision and Training. 
Defendants filed their answer on September 2, 2021.Onn June
7, 2019, Tamara Abdelgainy (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Teodocio
Borja Mendoza, Anthony Torres Demolition (collectively “Defendants”), and Does
1 through 50 for (1) negligence, (2) negligence per se, (3) vicarious
liability, (4) negligent entrustment of a motor vehicle, and (5) negligent
supervision causes of action arising from an automobile accident occurring on
June 12, 2017.
On January 5, 2023, Defendants served Plaintiff with Special
Interrogatories (Set Two) and Requests for Production of Documents (Set
Two).  When Plaintiff did not respond, Defendants filed motions to
compel Plaintiff to provide initial responses to the interrogatories and
requests for production.  Defendants also requested monetary
sanctions.
On January 2, 2024, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to compel,
ordered Plaintiff to respond to the discovery requests within 30 days of
notice, and ordered Plaintiff’s counsel to pay monetary sanctions in the amount
of $707.50.
Plaintiff did not comply with the order.  (Av Decl. ¶ 12.)  Accordingly, on February 15, 2024, Defendants
filed this motion for terminating sanctions.
After the motion was filed, Plaintiff belatedly served responses
to the interrogatories and requests for production.  (This may have occurred on or about March 8,
2024.)  Based on the reply papers, Defendants
do not appear to have any issue (other than the timing of service) with the
interrogatory responses.  Defendants contend,
however that the document production responses are still deficient.  (See Av Reply Decl. Exh. C.) 
Plaintiff filed her
opposition to the motion on March 11, 2024. 
Defendants filed their reply on March 19.
Legal Standard
“To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice
to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing,
may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a
misuse of the discovery process: ... (d) The court may impose a terminating
sanction …."  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030.) “Misuses of the
discovery process include, but are not limited to, the following: ... (d)
Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized method of discovery. ... (g)
Disobeying a court order to provide discovery."  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2023.010.)
The Civil Discovery Act provides for an escalating and
“incremental approach to discovery sanctions, starting with monetary sanctions
and ending with the ultimate sanction of termination.” (Lopez v. Watchtower
Bible & Tract Society of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th
566, 604.) Discovery sanctions should be appropriate to and commensurate
with the misconduct, and they “should not exceed that which is required to
protect the interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Doppes
v. Bentley Motors, Inc. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 967, 992.) “If a lesser
sanction fails to curb misuse, a greater sanction is warranted: continuing
misuses of the discovery process warrant incrementally harsher sanctions until
the sanction is reached that will curb the abuse.” (Ibid.; see also,
e.g., Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th
262, 279-280.) 
Terminating sanctions should be used sparingly. (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992; R.S. Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd. (1999)
75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 496.) “Although in extreme cases a court has the
authority to order a terminating sanction as a first measure, a terminating
sanction should generally not be imposed until the court has attempted less
severe alternatives and found them to be unsuccessful and/or the record clearly
shows lesser sanctions would be ineffective.” (Lopez, supra, 246 Cal.App.4th
at p. 604.)  But where discovery violations are “willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial
court is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction.” (Doppes, supra, 174
Cal.App.4th at p. 992.) Repeated and willful violations of discovery orders
that prejudice the opposing party may warrant a terminating sanction. (Creed-21
v. City of Wildomar (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 690, 702; Los
Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 377, 390; Biles
v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1327; Lang v.
Hachman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1246; Collisson X Kaplan
v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1617-1622.)
The
primary purpose of discovery sanctions is to obtain compliance with the Civil
Discovery Act and the Court’s orders. It is not to punish. (Newland v.
Super. Ct. (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 608, 613; Ghanooni v. Super
Shuttle of Los Angeles (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 262.) A discovery
sanction should not create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a
better position than it would have been if the opposing party had simply
complied with its obligations under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery
Act. (Rutledge v. Hewlett-Packard Co. (2015) 238 Cal.App.4th 1164,
1194; see also 2 Weil & Brown, California Practice Guide: Civil Procedure
Before Trial (The Rutter Group 2023), ¶¶ 8:2214-2220.)
A
“terminating sanction issued solely because of a failure to pay a monetary
discovery sanction is never justified.” 
(Newland, supra, 40 Cal.App.4th at p. 615.) An order for monetary sanctions is enforceable as
a money judgment under the Enforcement of Judgments Law, Code of Civil
Procedure sections 680.010, et seq.  (Ibid.) 
Discussion
Defendant requests terminating sanctions on the ground
that Plaintiff failed to comply with this Court’s January 2, 2024 order to
serve discovery responses within 30 days, failed to pay sanctions, and has
throughout the litigation been reluctant and slow to comply with her obligations
under the Civil Discovery Act.
 
Only after this motion was filed did Plaintiff comply –
in part – with the order.  Plaintiff served
interrogatory responses, late, but otherwise as ordered.  Plaintiff’s discovery response are woefully
deficient and come nowhere close to complying with her obligations under the
Civil Discovery Act, and Plaintiff’s counsel has not paid the sanctions, as
ordered.
 
This is serious discovery abuse.  Plaintiff’s misuse of the discovery process,
including her refusal to comply with her obligations under the Civil Discovery
Act and her failure to obey a clear and direct court order, warrants substantial
sanctions.  The only sanction requested
by Defendants, however, is a terminating sanction, and Defendants have not made
a sufficient showing, on this record, for such an extreme step.
 
For terminating sanctions, however, a party
must present evidence of repeated and willful misuse of the discovery process,
as well as evidence that less severe sanctions have
not (or likely will not) lead to compliance with the discovery rules.  Defendants have not, on this record at this
time, made such a showing.  There has not been a showing of a history or pattern of
willful abuse or repeated violations that have not been (or cannot be) cured by
lesser sanctions.
Moreover, a discovery sanction should not
create a “windfall” for a party or place a party in a better position than it
would have been if the opposing party had simply complied with its obligations
under the Court’s orders and the Civil Discovery Act. (Rutledge, supra, 238
Cal.App.4th at p. 1194.)  Here, at this
time, a terminating sanction would create such a windfall for Defendants.
Defendants request no other sanctions.
Accordingly,
the Defendant’s request for terminating sanctions is DENIED. 
The
denial as to terminating sanctions is without prejudice to Defendant in seeking
other sanctions or seeking a terminating sanction at a later stage of the
proceedings based on a further showing of misuse of the discovery process.
Conclusion
The
Court DENIES Defendant’s motion for terminating sanctions. 
Moving
Party is ordered to give notice.
