 Case Number:  20STCV44120    Hearing Date:   February 13, 2024    Dept:  15 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE MOTION IN LIMNE
Defendants’ Motion in Limine to Exclude
Michael Ellenbecker
            Defendant
John K. Bice Co, Inc. moves to exclude Plaintiffs’ expert Michael Ellenbecker
because Plaintiffs never offered him for an expert deposition before the
discovery cutoff date of January 22, 2024. 
Plaintiffs state they are withdrawing the expert.  Therefore the motion is off calendar.
