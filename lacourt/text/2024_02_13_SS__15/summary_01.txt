And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to strike non-pecuniary damages brought by the defendant, Puget Sound Commerce Center, Inc. The defendant argues that maritime law applies because the plaintiff's claims are based on Robert Baer's exposure to asbestos while serving in the Navy. However, the judge finds that the motion is too late, as the plaintiff's First Amended Complaint was filed over three years ago. Additionally, the judge notes that the defendant's motion is based on allegations made in the First Amended Complaint and cannot be supported by deposition testimony, which the court cannot take judicial notice of. Therefore, the judge denies the motion.
