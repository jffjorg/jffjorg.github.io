  Case Number:  20STCV14744    Hearing Date:   February 13, 2024    Dept:  15 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE MOTION TO STRIKE NON-PECUNIARY
DAMAGES
            Defendant
Puget Sound Commerce Center, Inc. filed a motion to strike Plaintiffs Polly
Gastrom and Suzanne Nesbit’s claims of non-pecuniary damages.  
            Defendant
argues that Plaintiffs’ claims against Defendant are based on Robert Baer being
exposed to asbestos while serving on activity duty aboard a Navy ship.  (Motion at p. 2.)  Accordingly, Defendant argues maritime law
applies and precludes non-pecuniary damages.
            This
motion is too late.  Plaintiffs filed the
First Amended Complaint on August 12, 2020, and Defendant filed an answer on
January 11, 2021.  Plaintiffs base this
motion on the allegations in paragraph 4 of the First Amended Complaint that
Baer “worked aboard the USS Waddell while in the United States Navy from 1964
to 1967,”and he “worked in the machinery spaces of the USS Waddell where he
worked on equipment that included asbestos insulation, gaskets and packing.”  (Motion at p. 5.)  Therefore, Plaintiffs could have filed this
motion more than three years ago.
            If
the motion is based on something other than the First Amended Complaint or a
matter of which the court is required to take judicial notice, then it does not
comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 437.  For example, Plaintiffs cite deposition
testimony of Gary Farris in support of the motion.  (Motion at p. 5.)  The court cannot take judicial notice of deposition
testimony.
The motion is DENIED.
            The
moving party is to give notice.
