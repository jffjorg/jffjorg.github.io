And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling states that the Court will continue the hearing on the Defendant's motion to strike portions of the Plaintiff's Verified Complaint to March 18, 2024. The Defendant, City of La Habra Heights, failed to meet the meet-and-confer requirements of CCP § 435.5, which requires the parties to meet and confer in person, by telephone, or by video conference to determine if an agreement can be reached that resolves the objections to be raised in the motion to strike. The Defendant's counsel's declaration is insufficient to establish that they satisfied this requirement. As a result, the Court is giving the Defendant an opportunity to comply with the meet-and-confer requirements before the continued hearing date. If the parties resolve the issues raised in the motion to strike, the Defendant shall take the motion off calendar. If the parties reach a partial resolution, they shall notify the Court at least seven days before the hearing. If the parties are unable to resolve any issues, the Defendant shall file a meet-and-confer declaration that complies with the requirements of CCP § 435.5, no later than seven days before the continued hearing date.
