Background
            Plaintiffs
Suzanne Emerson and Austin J. Cook filed this action on August 29, 2022 against
defendant Jeffrey L. Martin, alleging causes of action for (1) Partition (CCP §
872.230); (2) Breach of Contract; (3) Fraud; (4) Conversion; and (5) Theft
(Penal Code § 496(c). Plaintiffs filed an Amendment to Complaint on December 4,
2023, naming Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. for Doe 1.
            The
Complaint alleges the following: Defendant Jeffrey Martin was married to
Plaintiffs’ deceased mother, Patricia Martin (“Decedent”). (Compl., ¶ 8.)
Decedent executed and recorded on January 16, 2020 a Transfer of Deed on Death,
transferring equally to Defendant and Plaintiffs the property at 2306 Snowden
Avenue, Long Beach, CA 90815. (Id. at ¶¶ 8-9.) Decedent died on April 2,
2020. (Id. at ¶ 10.) Defendant petitioned on April 15, 2021 for the determination
of the property to pass to the surviving spouse without administration and
requested the immediate appointment of a probate referee. (Id. at ¶ 10.)
Defendant ceased all communications with Plaintiffs and refuses to vacate the subject
property so that it can be sold pursuant to Decedent’s wishes. (Id. at ¶
11.)
            Plaintiffs
filed a motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) on October
17, 2023. No opposition was received.
            Plaintiffs
filed a motion to compel inspection of real property on January 17, 2024. No

Legal Standard
If a party to whom interrogatories were
directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for
an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. (CCP § 2030.290(b)-(c);
see Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 404.) CCP §
2030.290 contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have
been served. All that needs to be shown in the moving papers is that a set of
interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to
respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111
Cal.App.3d 902, 905-906.)
If a party to whom demands for inspection,
copying, testing, or sampling were directed fails to serve a timely response,
the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2031.300(b)-(c).) CCP § 2031.300 contains no time
limit for a motion to compel where no responses have been served. The
propounding party need not demonstrate good cause or satisfy a meet-and-confer
requirement – all that needs to be shown in the moving papers is that a set of requests
for production of documents was properly served on the opposing party, that the
time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served.

v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 403-04.)
 
Discussion
Merits of the Motions
Plaintiffs Suzanne
Emerson and Austin J. Cook move to compel (1) responses from defendant Jeffrey Martin
to Form Interrogatories (Set One); and (2) the entry and inspection of the real
property located at 2306 Snowden Ave., Long Beach, CA 90815.
As to the motion
to compel responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One), the court finds Plaintiffs
sufficiently show it should be granted. Plaintiffs establish they served Form
Interrogatories (Set One) on Defendant, who was pro per at time, on February
10, 2023. (Fisher Decl., ¶ 6, Exh. A.) When Defendant retained counsel,
Plaintiffs’ counsel sent an email on May 13, 2023 requesting the outstanding
discovery and providing a 15-day extension to respond without objections. (Id.
at ¶ 7, Exh. B.) Defendant’s counsel never responded even after Plaintiffs’
counsel followed up on July 13, 2023. (Id. at ¶ 8, Exh. C.)
These facts show
Defendant failed to timely respond to the properly served Form Interrogatories
(Set One). Despite Plaintiffs’ follow-ups and extensions, Defendant never
served any written responses to the interrogatories. Defendant does not oppose
this motion, thus failing to show why the court should not grant it.
As to the motion
to compel inspection of real property, the court finds the matter needs to be
continued because it is unclear if Defendant was properly served with notice of
this motion. Plaintiffs filed and served this motion after Defendant’s counsel substituted
out of the case. In the Substitution of Attorney form, Defendant lists 2306
Snowden Avenue, Long Beach, CA 90805 as his address. While the address
Plaintiffs list is correct for the most part, the zip code is incorrect—Plaintiffs
specify a 90815 zip code in the proof of service, not 90805.
Under Evid. Code
§ 641, “[a] letter correctly addressed and properly mailed is presumed to have
been received in the ordinary course of mail.” Here, the court cannot presume Defendant
received the moving papers since they were served at an address with a
different zip code than the one listed by Defendant. The court notes the 90805 zip
code is the same zip code Plaintiffs used when they served Form Interrogatories
(Set One) on Defendant. Plaintiffs provide no explanation why a different zip
code was used for this motion.
Further, the
court notes the proof of service indicates the moving papers were electronically
served on Defendant. However, the email address listed is nowhere in the court’s
records. Plaintiffs’ counsel also indicates Defendant never responded when she
emailed him. (Fisher Decl., ¶¶ 8-11.) Thus, the court cannot presume Defendant electronically
received the moving papers.
Accordingly, the
court rules as follows:
The court GRANTS
Plaintiffs’ motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One). The
court orders defendant Jeffrey L. Martin to serve
responses, without objections, to Form Interrogatories
(Set One), within 30 days of the date of this ruling.
The court
CONTINUES the hearing for Plaintiffs’ motion to
compel inspection of real property to the date and time above, in Department
45. The court orders Plaintiffs to file a proper proof of service at least
seven days before the continued hearing date.
 
 Request for Monetary Sanctions
Plaintiffs
request $1,576.65 in attorney’s fees and costs as monetary sanctions against
Defendant and his counsel of record for this motion. Plaintiffs’ counsel’s
hourly rate is $300. (Fisher Decl., ¶ 10.) Plaintiffs request to recover five
hours, the $61.65 filing fee, and the $15 electronic filing fee for this
motion. (Id. at ¶¶ 11-12.)
The court finds Plaintiffs’s
counsel’s hourly rate is reasonable, but the number of hours Plaintiffs request
is unreasonable. This is a basic, unopposed motion that does not raise any
issues justifying the amount Plaintiffs seek. Plaintiffs seek two hours for
preparing the motion, one hour for reviewing opposition, one hour for preparing
a reply, and one hour for attending hearing. (Id. at ¶ 11.) The two
hours for reviewing opposition/preparing reply do not apply since this motion
was unopposed. The court finds reducing Plaintiffs’ recoverable time to one hour
for preparing the motion and 0.5 hours for attending hearing is reasonable. The
court finds Plaintiffs’ requests for the $61.65 filing fee and the $15 electronic
filing fee are reasonable. Thus, Plaintiffs’ total reduced recoverable amount
in attorney’s fees and costs is $526.65 ([(1 hour + 0.5 hours) x $300/hour] + $61.65
filing fee + $15 electronic fee)
The court therefore
GRANTS Plaintiffs’ request for monetary sanctions against Defendant and his
counsel of record in the reduced amount of $526.65 in
attorney’s fees and costs. The court orders defendant Jeffrey L. Martin and his
counsel of record, Howard Brief, jointly and severally, to pay $526.65 to
plaintiffs Suzanne Emerson and Austin J. Cook, through their counsel of record,
within 20 days of the date of this ruling.
 
            It
is so ordered.
