And here is a summary in English text:

The tentative ruling grants in part the defendant's motion for a protective order regarding the plaintiff's special interrogatories (Set One). The court limits the definition of "IDENTIFY" to the individual's name, address, and last known contact information. The court strikes certain special interrogatories (Nos. 12-14, 16, 24-25, 43, 46-48, 88, and 93) and orders the defendant to respond to certain others (Nos. 9 and 82) without objections. The court also denies in part the motion, ordering the defendant to respond to the remaining special interrogatories within 30 days. The ruling seeks to reduce the scope of discovery and limit the number of special interrogatories.
