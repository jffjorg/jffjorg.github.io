And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Plaintiff Mister Bailey's motion to compel Defendant Juan F. Vaquerano's responses to special interrogatories, set one, and has ordered Defendant Vaquerano to pay sanctions of $500.00 to Plaintiff's counsel. The judge found that Defendant Vaquerano failed to respond to the propounded discovery requests despite a meet-and-confer effort, and that this failure constitutes a misuse of the discovery process. As a result, the judge ordered Defendant Vaquerano to serve verified responses to the special interrogatories, set one, without objections within 20 days of service of the order, and to pay the sanctions within the same timeframe.
