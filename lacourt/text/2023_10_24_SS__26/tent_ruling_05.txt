ANALYSIS:
 
On July 11, 2023, Plaintiff Mister Bailey (“Plaintiff”)
served Special Interrogatories, Set One, on Defendant Juan F. Vaquerano
(“Defendant Vaquerano”). (Motion, Mehrban Decl.,
Exh. A.) Despite a meet-and-confer effort extending the deadline to serve
verified responses without objections, Defendant Vaquerano has not served
responses. (Id. at ¶¶4-5 and Exh. B.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion
to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for
Sanctions, on September 7, 2023. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) Further, the motion can be brought at any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290.) Based on Defendant Vaquerano’s failure
to respond to the propounded discovery, Plaintiff is entitled to an order
compelling service of verified responses to the discovery requests without
objections. 
 
Defendant Vaquerano’s failure to timely respond constitutes
a misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)
Sanctions are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and
2023.030 and have been properly noticed. Sanctions are awarded against
Defendant Vaquerano in the amount of $500.00 based on one hour of attorney time
billed at $500.00 per hour. (Motion, Mehrban Decl., ¶6.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Mister Bailey’s Motion to Compel Defendant Juan F.
Vaquerano’s Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for
Sanctions, is GRANTED. DEFENDANT JUAN
F. VAQUERANO IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET
ONE, WITHOUT OBJECTIONS, WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. DEFENDANT JUAN
F. VAQUERANO IS ORDERED TO PAY
SANCTIONS OF $500.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS
ORDER.
