And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has considered the Defendant's Motion to Vacate Default Judgment and has tentatively ruled that the motion is continued to December 19, 2023. By November 28, 2023, the Plaintiff may file and serve a supplemental opposition addressing the grounds for relief raised in the reply. The Defendant will not be allowed to file or serve any further briefing. The Court notes that the Defendant's initial motion raised arguments under Code of Civil Procedure sections 473(b) and 473.5, but the reply dropped these arguments and only raised section 473(d). However, since the Plaintiff was not provided notice of this statutory basis until the reply, the Court cannot consider it at this time.
