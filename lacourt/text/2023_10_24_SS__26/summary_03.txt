And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award filed by Minjing Wang against Automation Alliance Group, LLC is denied. The Court has repeatedly found that Wang has not demonstrated proper service of the Petition and notice of hearing as required by statute. Specifically, Wang has not shown service of the Petition itself, only service of the notice of hearing by electronic mail. Additionally, Wang has not provided proof of service of the Arbitration Award, which is required by statute. As a result, Wang has not satisfied the requirements for confirming the Arbitration Award, and the Court cannot confirm the Award as made.
