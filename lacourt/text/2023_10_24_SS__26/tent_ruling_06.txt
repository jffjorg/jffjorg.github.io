ANALYSIS:
 
On July 5, 2023, Plaintiff Alejandro Diaz (“Plaintiff”)
served Special Interrogatories, Set One, on Defendant T&T Lifestyle, LLC
(“Defendant T&T”). (Motion, Mehrban Decl.,
Exh. A.) Despite a meet-and-confer effort extending the deadline to serve
verified responses without objections, Defendant T&T has not served
responses. (Id. at ¶¶4-5 and Exh. B.) Plaintiff filed the instant Motion
to Compel Responses to Special Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for
Sanctions, on August 30, 2023. No opposition has been filed to date.
 
There is no requirement for a prior meet and confer effort
before a motion to compel initial responses can be filed. (Code Civ. Proc., §
2030.290.) Further, the motion can be brought any time after the responding
party fails to provide the responses. 
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.290.) Based on Defendant T&T’s failure to
respond to the propounded discovery, Plaintiff is entitled to an order
compelling it to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without
objections. 
 
Defendant T&T’s failure to timely respond constitutes a
misuse of the discovery process. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.010, subd. (d).)
Sanctions are appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 2023.010 and
2023.030 and have been properly noticed. Sanctions are awarded against
Defendant T&T in the amount of $500.00 based on one hour of attorney time
billed at $500.00 per hour. (Motion, Mehrban Decl., ¶6.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Alejandro Diaz’s Motion
to Compel Defendant T&T Lifestyle, LLC’s Responses to Special
Interrogatories, Set One, and Request for Sanctions, is GRANTED. DEFENDANT T&T LIFESTYLE, LLC IS TO SERVE VERIFIED RESPONSES TO SPECIAL INTERROGATORIES, SET ONE,
WITHOUT OBJECTIONS, WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER. DEFENDANT T&T
LIFESTYLE, LLC IS ORDERED TO PAY SANCTIONS OF $500.00 TO PLAINTIFF’S
COUNSEL WITHIN 20 DAYS’ SERVICE OF THIS ORDER.
