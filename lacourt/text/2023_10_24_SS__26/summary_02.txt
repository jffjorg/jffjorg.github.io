And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to deny Plaintiff Juan Jose Garcia's motion to vacate a dismissal in a motor vehicle negligence case. The plaintiff had failed to appear at trial and the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss. The plaintiff later filed a motion to vacate the dismissal, citing illness as the reason for missing the trial. However, the court found that the motion was filed too late, almost six months after the dismissal was granted, and that there was no evidence to support the exercise of discretion to find that the motion was filed within a reasonable time.
