ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Carmen Pelayo (“Plaintiff”)
filed the instant action for civil rights violations against Defendants Shawn Shayan
(“Defendant”), Mansour Shayan, and Helen Shayan on May 29, 2015. Thereafter,
the procedural history becomes murky.
 
It appears default was entered
against Defendant on July 16, 2015. (Request for Entry of Default, 07/16/25.) However,
when Defendant filed an Application for Stay and Early Evaluation Conference on
July 29, 2015, the Court stayed the action and set the conference for September
22, 2015. (Notice of Stay and Early Evaluation Conference, filed 07/29/15.) In
other words, the Court proceeded as if no default had been entered against
Defendant. A copy of the Notice of Stay and Early Evaluation Conference was
mailed to Plaintiff on August 25, 2015. (Declaration of Mailing, filed
08/27/15.) 
 
On September 22, 2015, Plaintiff
did not appear for the conference and the Court granted Defendant’s oral motion
to dismiss the action with prejudice. (Minute Order, 09/22/15.) Notice of the
ruling was served on Plaintiff on the same date. (Minute Order, 09/22/15, p.
2.) On October 9, 2015, Plaintiff filed a motion to vacate the dismissal
without notice to Defendant, which the Court granted on November 9, 2016.
(Minute Order, 11/09/16.) The Court then recognized the entry of default
against Defendant and granted Plaintiff’s request for default judgment on
January 17, 2017. (Default Judgment, 01/17/17.) 
 
Defendant filed the instant
Motion to Vacate Default Judgment on September 28, 2023. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on October 2, 2023 and Defendant replied on October 13, 2023. 
 
Discussion
 
Defendant
initially moves
to vacate the entry of default judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 473, subdivisions (b), or section 473.5. Plaintiff is correct to point
out in opposition that relief under Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision
(b) is barred by the jurisdictional six-month deadline. (See Code Civ. Proc., §
473, subd. (b).) Likewise, a motion under section 473.5 has an outer deadline
of two years from default judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 473.5, subd. (a).) 
 
The
reply drops arguments under section 473, subdivision (b) and section 473.5, and
only raises Code of Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d). (Reply, p.
3.) However, as Plaintiff was not provided notice that Defendant would move to
vacate the default judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 473,
subdivision (d) until the reply, the Court cannot consider that statutory basis
at this time.
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Shawn Shayan’s Motion to Vacate Default Judgment
is CONTINUED TO DECEMBER 19, 2023 AT 10:00 AM IN DEPARTMENT 26 IN THE SPRING
STREET COURTHOUSE. BY NOVEMBER 28, 2023, PLAINTIFF MAY FILE AND SERVE A
SUPPLEMENTAL OPPOSITION ADDRESSING THE GROUNDS FOR RELIEF RAISED IN THE REPLY.
NO FURTHER BRIEFING BY DEFENDANT IS TO BE FILED OR SERVED.
