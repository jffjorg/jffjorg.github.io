Antonyan v. Shadow Mountain View COA, et al.MOTION
FOR SANCTIONS
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff Vardan Antonyan’s Motion for Sanctions is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Plaintiff Vardan Antonyan (“Plaintiff”) filed the instant
action against Defendant Shadow Mountain View Community Association
(“Defendant”) on January 11, 2023. Defendant filed an answer on February 14,
2023. On July 18, 2023, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion to compel
production of documents pursuant to deposition subpoena and issued sanctions
against Plaintiff in the amount of $100.00. (Minute Order, 07/18/23.) 
 
Plaintiff filed the instant Motion for Sanctions on August
2, 2023, then filed a First Amended Complaint on September 8, 2023. The Court
strikes the First Amended Complaint as it was filed without leave. (See Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 472, subd. (a), 436, subd. (b).) Correlatively, the Court
strikes the answer to the First Amended Complaint filed on September 25, 2023.
 
Defendant filed an opposition to the instant Motion for
Sanctions on October 10, 2023. 
 
Plaintiff’s Motion does not cite
any legal authority in support of the request for sanctions. The only authority
cited pertains to the merits of Plaintiff’s action against Defendant. (Motion,
¶¶3, 5A-B.) Therefore, Plaintiff has not shown a legal basis for an award of
sanctions against Defendant. 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff
Vardan Antonyan’s Motion for Sanctions is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
