ANALYSIS:
 
On February 13,
2018, Plaintiff Brent Biggs (“Plaintiff”), in pro per, filed this action for breach
of loan agreement against Defendant Thomas
Johnson (“Defendant”). Defendant, also in pro per, filed an answer on
May 18, 2023. The parties were ordered to mediation and a stipulation regarding
settlement was signed and filed on February 5, 2020. (Minute Order, 02/05/23.)
The Court also dismissed the action with a retention of jurisdiction pursuant
to Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6. (Ibid.)
 
On August 2, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
instant “Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings,” which is actually a motion to
enter judgment pursuant to the parties’ settlement agreement. To date, no
opposition has been filed. 
 
Legal Standard
 
The instant motion is brought under Code of Civil Procedure, section
664.6, which states in relevant part:
 
If parties to pending litigation
stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court
or orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the
court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.
If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties
to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the
settlement.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd.
(a).) Prior to January 1, 2021, “parties” under section 664.6 meant the
litigants themselves, not their attorneys. 
(Levy v. Superior Court (1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 586.) The current
statute provides that “parties” includes “an attorney who represents the party”
and an insurer’s agent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 664.6, subd. (b).) The settlement
must include the signatures of the parties seeking to enforce the agreement,
and against whom enforcement is sought. (J.B.B. Investment Partners, Ltd. v.
Fair (2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 974, 985.) Plaintiff has demonstrated the settlement agreement complies with
the statutory requirements set forth above as it was signed by both parties. (Stipulation
Re Settlement, filed 02/05/23, p. 2.)
 
Furthermore, the request for
retention of jurisdiction must be made in writing, by the parties, before the
action is dismissed for the Court’s retention of jurisdiction to conform to the
statutory language. (Wackeen v. Malis (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 429, 433 [“If,
after a suit has been dismissed, a party brings a section 664.6 motion for a
judgment on a settlement agreement but cannot present to the court a request
for retention of jurisdiction that meets all of these requirements, then
enforcement of the agreement must be left to a separate lawsuit.”].) The
parties’ request for retention of jurisdiction complies with these requirements
because it was made in writing to the Court before the action was dismissed.
(Motion, Attachment A, ¶6.) 
 
The settlement provides that
Defendant would pay Plaintiff $17,000.00 in monthly payments starting on January
15, 2021. (Id. at Attachment A, ¶1.) The settlement agreement also
provides that upon Defendant’s default, Plaintiff may seek judgment in the settlement
amount, less any monies paid. (Id. at Attachment A, ¶2.) Payments of $4,320.00
were made towards the settlement, after which Defendant defaulted. (Id.
at Attachments C-D.) Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff is entitled to entry of
judgment against Defendant in the amount of $12,680.00 principal ($17,000.00 -
$4,320.00). (Id. at Exh. A, ¶4.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Plaintiff Brent Biggs’ Motion to Enforce Settlement
Agreement is GRANTED. JUDGMENT TO BE ENTERED IN PLAINTIFF’S FAVOR AND AGAINST
DEFENDANT THOMAS JOHNSON IN THE
AMOUNT OF $12,860.00 PRINCIPAL. PLAINTIFF IS TO FILE A PROPOSED JUDGMENT WITHIN
20 DAYS OF THIS ORDER.
