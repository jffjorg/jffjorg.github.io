Wang
v. Automation Alliance Group, LLC, et al.PETITION TO CONFIRM ARBITRATION AWARD
(CCP § 1285, et seq.)
TENTATIVE RULING: 
 
Petitioner Minjing Wang’s Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award is DENIED.
 
 
ANALYSIS:
 
Petitioner Minjing Wang (“Petitioner”) filed the instant
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award against Respondent Automation Alliance
Group, LLC (“Respondent”) on February 10, 2023. The Petition initially came for
hearing on April 26, 2023, at which time it was continued to allow Petitioner
to file proof of service of the Petition and the notice of hearing in
accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure. (Minute Order, 04/26/23.) 
 
Petitioner filed proof of service and a notice of hearing on
May 1, 2023. At the hearing on June 28, 2023, the Court again found that
service was not proper. Specifically, that “[t]he proof of service and notice
of hearing filed on May 1, 2023 do not demonstrate compliance with Code of
Civil Procedure sections 415.10 to 415.95. They only demonstrate that
Petitioner served Respondent with the notice of hearing by electronic mail.
(Proof of Service, filed 05/01/23; Notice of Hearing, filed 05/01/23.) Nor has Petitioner
demonstrated any service of the Petition itself, let alone service of the
Petition that conforms to Code of Civil Procedure sections 415.10 to 415.95.”
(Minute Order, 06/28/23.) The Court continued the hearing to August 28, 2023 to
allow Petitioner to properly serve Respondent.
 
On July 7, 2023, Petitioner filed a proof of service
attesting to service of “minute order-notice of hearing on petition for August
28, 2023; Arbitration Award; Notice of case assignment; LASC-Case Access” on
Respondent by mail. (Proof of Service by Mail, filed 07/07/28.) 
 
At the hearing of August 28, 2023, the Court’s tentative
ruling pointed out that the proof of service filed on July 7, 2023 was
inadequate. Specifically, the proof of service did “not show any manner of service of the Petition itself. Second, service by
mail [of the notice of hearing] is not a manner of service provided for a
summons under Code of Civil Procedure sections 415.10 to 415.95.” (Minute
Order, 08/28/23.) The Court continued the hearing again to allow Petitioner to
demonstrate service of the Petition and notice of hearing date as required by
statute. 
 
Petitioner filed a
proof of personal service on September 6, 2023. No response to the Petition has
been filed to date. 
 
Legal Standard
 
“Any party to an arbitration in which an award has been made
may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the award.  The petition shall name as respondent all
parties to the arbitration and may name as respondents any other persons bound
by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1285.) “If a petition or response under this chapter is duly
served and filed, the court shall confirm the award as made, whether rendered
in this state or another state, unless in accordance with this chapter it corrects
the award and confirms it as corrected, vacates the award or dismisses the
proceeding.” (Code Civ. Proc., §
1286.)
 
A response to a
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award that seeks to vacate or correct the award
must be served and filed no later than 100 days after the date of the service
of a signed copy of the award on the respondent. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288.2.)
 
Discussion
 
Service of the Petition and Notice of Hearing
 
Code of Civil
Procedure, section 1290.4 requires that the Petition and Notice of Hearing be
served on Respondent “in the manner provided in the arbitration agreement for
the service of such petition and notice” or “[i]f the arbitration agreement
does not provide the manner in which such service shall be made . . . [s]ervice
within this State shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service
of summons in an action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.4, subds. (a), (b).) 
 
The parties’
arbitration agreement does not provide for the manner of service of the
Petition and Notice of Hearing. (Petition, Attachment 4(b), ¶10(c).) It follows
that the Petition and the notice of hearing must be served on Respondent in the
manner provided by law for service of a summons, which is set forth at Code of
Civil Procedure sections 415.10 to 415.95. The proof of personal service filed
on September 6, 2023 does not demonstrate service as required by statute
because it still does not show service of the Petition. Instead, the papers
served by personal service included the Civil Case Cover Sheet, “Minute Order;
Final Award; Civil Case Cover Sheet Addendum And Statement Of Location; Notice
Of Case Assignment - Limited Civil Case;” (Proof of Personal Service, filed
09/06/23, ¶2.) 
 
Therefore, despite
multiple opportunities to do so, Petitioner still has not demonstrated service
of the Petition and the notice of hearing in compliance with Code of Civil
Procedure section 1290.4.
 
Service of the Arbitration Award and Timing of Service
of Petition (CCP §§ 1283.6, 1288, 1288.4)
 
Code of Civil
Procedure section 1283.6 requires that “[t]he neutral arbitrator shall serve a
signed copy of the award on each party to the arbitration personally or by
registered or certified mail or as provided in the agreement.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1283.6.) This requirement may be satisfied by service by the
arbitrator, or upon proper service of the Award with the Petition. (See Murry v. Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. (1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 796, 799-800.) No
proof of service is attached to the arbitration award. (Pet., Attachment 8(c).)
Nor has it been properly served with the Petition. Until proof of service of
the arbitration award is provided, Petitioner has not demonstrated compliance
with Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.6.
 
Also, a party seeking a court judgment confirming an
arbitration award must file and serve the petition no more than four years, but
not less than 10 days, after the award is served.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1288, 1288.4.) As there is no proof of service of
the Petition demonstrating compliance with the service statutes, the Court
cannot find Petitioner has satisfied the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1288 and
1288.4.
 
Confirmation of the Arbitration Award
 
An arbitration award
is not directly enforceable until it is confirmed by a court and judgment is
entered.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1287.6; Jones
v. Kvistad (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 836, 840.) The court must confirm the award
as made, unless it corrects or vacates the award, or dismisses the
proceeding.  (CCP § 1286; Valsan
Partners Limited Partnership v. Calcor Space Facility, Inc. (1994) 25
Cal.App.4th 809, 818.) Code of Civil Procedure, section 1285.4 states a
petition under this chapter shall:
 
a)     
Set forth the substance of or have attached a copy of
the agreement to arbitrate unless the petitioner denies the existence of such
an agreement.
 
b)     
Set forth the names of the arbitrators.
 
c)     
Set forth or have attached a copy of the award and the
written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.
 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.) The Petition complies with the
above requirements. It sets forth the nature of the arbitration agreement and
the name of the arbitrator. (Pet., ¶¶4-6.) A copy of the arbitration agreement
is also attached. (Id. at Attachment 8(c).) Substantively, the Petition
demonstrates that Petitioner is entitled to an award of $24,970.00 from
Respondent. (Id. at Attachment 8(c) at p. 2.) 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing,
Petitioner Minjung Wang’s Petition to
Confirm Arbitration Award is DENIED.
 
 
Court clerk to give notice.
