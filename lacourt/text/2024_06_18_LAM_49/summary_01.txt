The court has denied Defendant Shahriar Rad's Special Motion to Strike the Complaint under the anti-SLAPP statute. The court found that Defendant failed to demonstrate that the challenged claims arise from protected activity. The court analyzed the allegations in the Complaint and determined that they are not protected by the anti-SLAPP statute. The court also noted that Defendant's counsel made an unprofessional personal attack on opposing counsel, which was unnecessary and uncivil.
