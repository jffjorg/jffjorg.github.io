And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has tentatively ruled in favor of the defendants, sustaining their demurrer to the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff, Wil Master, has alleged that the defendants, Sonoma Biologics, Inc. and Paul Caracciolo, are liable for their actions as a corporation. However, the court has found that the plaintiff's allegations are conclusory and lack specific facts about the control exercised by the defendants and the commingling of assets. The court has granted the plaintiff 30 days to amend the complaint to provide specific facts that would support a conclusion that the alter ego doctrine applies. The plaintiff is not allowed to add new parties or causes of action without the court's permission.
