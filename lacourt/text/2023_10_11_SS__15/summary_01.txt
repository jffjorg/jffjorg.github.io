And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendant's motion to quash service of summons for lack of personal jurisdiction. The plaintiff's complaint against the defendant, Vanderbilt Minerals, LLC, Inc., is dismissed without prejudice. The defendant supplied talc to the plaintiff, but the plaintiff failed to identify specific products containing the defendant's talc, despite having four and a half months to take discovery. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not established jurisdiction over the defendant and that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable.
