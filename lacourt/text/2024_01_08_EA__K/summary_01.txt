Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the Plaintiffs' application for default judgment without prejudice. The court notes several defects in the Plaintiffs' submissions, including the lack of documentary evidence to support their claims, insufficient information about the defective conditions at the property, and unclear damages calculations. The court also notes that the Plaintiffs' complaint only claims damages in excess of $25,000.00, but the Plaintiffs seek $75,000.00 or more in damages. The court instructs Plaintiffs' counsel to provide a full and complete default prove-up application in the future, which includes a Request for Entry of Default/Court Judgment on Judicial Council Form CIV-100.
