  Case Number:  22PSCV00679    Hearing Date:   January 8, 2024    Dept:  K Plaintiffs
Rosalinda Rodriguez and Leslie Perez’s Application for Default Judgment is
DENIED without prejudice.
 
Background    
 
Plaintiffs Rosalinda Rodriguez and Leslie Perez
(“Plaintiffs”) allege as follows: 
 
Plaintiffs have been tenants at the
property located at 1398 S. Gibbs, Pomona, CA 91766 (“subject property”) since
on or about August 1, 2016. Defendant Emelia Ramirez (“Ramirez”) was
responsible for managing and maintaining the subject property, but maintained
same in a substandard condition and failed to make repairs, despite Plaintiffs’
complaints. Plaintiffs were forced to move out of the subject property. 
 
On July 6, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a complaint, asserting causes
of action against Ramirez and Does 1-50 for:
 
1.                 
Failure to Provide Habitable Dwelling
2.                 
Breach of Covenant and Right to Quiet Enjoyment 
3.                 
Private Nuisance
4.                 
Negligence
 
On August 25, 2022, Ramirez’s default was entered.
 
An Order to Show Cause Re: Default Judgment is set for
January 8, 2024.
 
Discussion
 
Plaintiff’s Application for Default Judgment is denied without
prejudice. The following defects are noted:
 
1.                 
Plaintiffs have now submitted declarations; however,
they have not provided the court with any documentary evidence supporting their
claims, including, but not limited to, a copy of the underlying lease
agreement, text messages, video recording(s), inspection report(s) and
pictures, as referenced in ¶¶ 2 and 5-8 of Rodriguez’s and Perez’s respective declarations.

2.         Plaintiffs’ respective declarations are
devoid of facts as to when they notified Ramirez of purportedly defective
conditions at the subject property, what these defective conditions were, whether
Ramirez was given a reasonable time to correct the deficiencies and what
damages Plaintiffs sustained. It is unclear to the court how Plaintiffs’
damages have been calculated. It is also unclear when Plaintiffs moved out of
the subject property. 
3.                 
Again, Plaintiffs’ complaint states only that
Plaintiffs’ damages are “in excess of 
$25,000.00.” (Complaint, ¶ 39; see
also, ¶ 46 [“Plaintiffs have suffered actual damages . . . in an amount to be
determined at trial but in any event $25,000.00 or over”] and ¶ 55 [“Plaintiffs
have suffered damages . . . in an amount to be proved at trial are [sic]
$25,000.00 and over”].) Plaintiff, however, appears to seek $75,000.00 or more
in damages. “[I]n all default judgments the demand sets a ceiling on recovery.”
(Greenup v. Rodman (1986) 42 Cal.3d 822, 824; Code Civ. Proc. § 580,
subd. (a) [“The relief granted to the plaintiff, if there is no answer, cannot
exceed that demanded in the complaint, in the statement required by Section
425.11, or in the statement provided for by Section 425.115 . . .”].) 
4.                 
The court will not accept any further piecemeal
submissions. Plaintiffs’ counsel is 
instructed to provide the court
with a full and complete default prove-up application in the future, which
includes a Request for Entry of Default/Court Judgment on Judicial Council Form
CIV-100 [Rev. January 1, 2023].
