And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of 22STCV33658, granting the defendant's motion to compel further responses to request for production of documents. The defendant, Samuel Welch, moves to compel further responses from the plaintiff, Noah Pen-El, who has provided incomplete answers. The court finds that the responses consist of references to other items, which is an improper and factually incomplete answer. The court cites Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) to support its decision. The court orders the responding party to serve complete and responsive answers within 30 days. The court also reserves the right to set an OSC re: Discovery Referee in lieu of a hearing on any given motion.
