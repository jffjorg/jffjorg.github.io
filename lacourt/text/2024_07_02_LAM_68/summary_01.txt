And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has granted the motion of Buraq Investment Group, LLC to vacate the default and default judgment entered against it. The court finds that the service by publication was invalid due to the lack of actual notice, making the judgment void. The court also declines to grant the motion on alternative grounds of excusable neglect because the motion was filed more than seven months after the default was entered, which is outside the time limit for granting such relief. The court orders Buraq Investment Group, LLC to file and serve a proposed answer to the complaint. The court will also conduct a Case Management Conference concurrently.
