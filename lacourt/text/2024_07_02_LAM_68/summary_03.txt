Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in YAML format:

**Case Information**

* Case Number: 23STCV11602
* Hearing Date: July 2, 2024
* Dept: 68 Dept

**Parties**

* Moving Party: Cosentino Group, S.A.
* Responding Party: Wendy Viridiana Solano-Castro, et al.

**Relief Requested**

* Motion to Quash Service of the Summons and Complaint

**Summary of Action**

* Plaintiffs allege the wrongful death of Raul Garcia-Leon caused by working with "toxic" stone products
* Complaint names multiple parties, including suppliers and sellers

**Facts**

* Plaintiffs filed a 582-paragraph complaint on May 22, 2023
* Case deemed non-complex on June 5, 2023, and assigned to Department 68 on June 7, 2023
* MS International, Inc. demurred to the fourth cause of action on October 11, 2023, and the court sustained the demurrer
* Caesarstone USA, Inc. and Lowes Home Centers, LLC filed cross-complaints on November 2, 2023, and December 29, 2023, respectively
* Court issued a 12-page order denying the motion to quash service on December 8, 2023
* Parties agreed to a deposition of a person most knowledgeable regarding jurisdictional issues on April 30, 2024
* California Supreme Court denied certiorari

**Legal Standard**

* When a defendant moves to quash service on jurisdictional grounds, the plaintiff has the initial burden of demonstrating facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction
* Once facts showing minimum contacts with the forum state are established, it becomes the defendant's burden to demonstrate that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable
* The court's factual determinations are not disturbed on appeal if supported by substantial evidence

**Analysis**

* General jurisdiction exists only in the defendant's state of incorporation or principal place of business
* Cosentino Group, S.A. operates as a Spanish corporation with no business presence in California, so there is no basis for general jurisdiction
* Specific jurisdiction requires an "affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy", which is lacking in this case
* Plaintiffs' contention that Cosentino Group, S.A. licensed the use of its trademark to C&C, its U.S. subsidiary, and created a market for the product in the U.S., is not supported by evidence
* Moving defendant challenges Plaintiffs' claim that moving defendant is the owner of the Consentino trademark and argues that any references to "Consentino, S.A." prior to July 23, 2023, are not references to moving defendant

**Conclusion**

* The court grants the motion to quash service of the summons and complaint.

**Significant Statements**

* "For the purposes of jurisdiction, the analysis begins with 'the firm proposition that neither ownership nor control of a subsidiary corporation by a foreign parent corporation, without more, subjects the parent to the jurisdiction of the state where the subsidiary does business.'" (BBA Aviation PLC v. Superior Court (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th at p. 430, quoting Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 523, 540.)
* "Cosentino Group and C&C are separate and independent corporate entities. Cosentino Group does not manage or control the day-to-day operations of C&C. C&C keeps its own separate bank accounts and business records, and C&C pays and manages its own employees." (Cuervo Decl. Â¶ 8.)
