Motion
to Vacate Default
 
SUMMARY
OF ACTION
Plaintiff
Daniel Moon participated in a $2.5 million joint investment venture for the
purchase of a “vertically integrated” cannabis business owned and operated by
defendants Buraq Investment Group, LLC and Zhi Yun Huang in the City of
Montebello. Defendant Masaji Konishi acted as agent on behalf of Huang and
Buraq Investment Group. The investment also involved the purchase of commercial
premises located at 7131 Telegraph Road, Montebello, for $1.8 million, though
the appraised value was only $1.3 million. Following the execution of documents
and tender of funds, Plaintiff alleges the discovery of the fraud in the
underlying transaction through misrepresentations of material terms.
 
On
December 29, 2021, Plaintiff filed a complaint for Breach of Contract, Fraud,
Negligent Misrepresentation, and Violation of Business and Professions Code
section 17200. On March 8, 2022, the clerk entered a default against Zhi Yun
Huang. 
 
Orders
for service by publication were issues for Masaji Konishi, and Buraq Investment
Group, LLC, on February 6, 2023. An order for service by publication on
7131Telegraph LLC was issued on February 9, 2023. On July 21, 2023, the clerk
entered defaults against Masaji Konishi, Buraq Investment Group, LLC, and
7131Telegraph LLC. On August 1, 2023, Plaintiff dismissed Kevin Kim without
prejudice. On August 30, 2023, the court entered default judgments against Zhi
Yun Huang, Masaji Konishi, Buraq Investment Group, LLC, and 7131Telegraph LLC.
 
RULING: Granted.
Defendant Buraq Investment Group, LLC moves to vacate the July
21, 2023, entered default and August 30, 2023, default judgment on grounds of lack
of actual notice of the complaint, due to invalid/lack of service on the
California Secretary of State. Plaintiff Daniel Moon filed a notice of
non-opposition to the motion. No reply was filed. 
 
Buraq Investment Group, LLC moves for relief under Code of
Civil Procedure section 473, subdivision (d) regarding a void judgment, and
section 473, subdivision (b) under the mistake, inadvertence, excusable neglect
standard. On the void judgment standard, Buraq Investment Group, LLC maintains
no service on the California Secretary of State, and instead proceeded via
service by publication against the corporate entity. 
 
Any and all lawfully operating
corporations in the State of California must present an agent for service.
(Corp. Code, §§
1502, 1505, 16310.) Service on a corporate entity is required to be completed
on the agent for service. (Corp. Code § 17701.16., subd. (b).) Plaintiff was
required to execute proper service on the proper agent/entity or obtain leave
to serve the Secretary of State if no designated agent can be located. (Corp.
Code, § 17701.16, subd. (c); Code Civ. Proc., § 415.10, et seq.) 
 
Zhi Yun Huang was the designated agent for service at all
relevant times. [Declaration of Zhi Yun Huang.] Plaintiff elected to proceed
via service by publication. The court finds the application and February 6,
2023, order allowing publication against the corporate entity lacking support
given the provisions of Corporate Code section 17701.16. 
 
A trial court
can set aside a judgment pursuant to 473, subdivision (d) on a void judgment. (Talley v.
Valuation Counselors Group, Inc. (2010)
191 Cal.App.4th 132, 146.) “A court can lack fundamental authority over the
subject matter, question presented, or party, making its judgment void, or it
can merely act in excess of its jurisdiction or defined power, rendering the
judgment voidable.” (In re Marriage of Goddard (2004) 33
Cal.4th 49, 56.) “A judgment is void if the
court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter or parties, for example, if
the defendant was not validly served with summons.” (Johnson v. E-Z Ins. Brokerage, Inc. (2009)
175 Cal.App.4th 86, 98.) The invalid service renders the judgment subject to a
determination of being void. The court therefore grants the motion on
this basis. 
 
The court also considers the alternative request under Code
of Civil Procedure section 473 subdivision (b): 
 
“The court may, upon any terms as may
be just, relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,
dismissal, order, or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or
her mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect. Application for this
relief shall be accompanied by a copy of the answer or other pleading proposed
to be filed therein, otherwise the application shall not be granted, and shall
be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months, after the
judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding was taken.”
 
“The six-month time limit for granting statutory relief is
jurisdictional and the court may not consider a motion for relief made after
that period has elapsed. (Citation.) The six-month period runs from entry of
default, not entry of judgment.” (Manson,
Iver & York v. Black (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 36, 42.) “[A] trial
court is obligated
to set aside a default, default judgment, or
dismissal if the motion for mandatory relief (1) is filed within six months of
the entry of judgment, (2) ‘is in proper form,’ (3) is accompanied by
the attorney affidavit of fault, and (4) demonstrates that
the default or dismissal was in fact caused by
the attorney's mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect.’” (Martin Potts & Associates, Inc. v.
Corsair, LLC (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 432, 443.) A discretionary
standard applies to the motion given the lack of an attorney statement and
dependence on the individual parties’ explanations. (Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1251-1252; see Rodriguez v. Brill (2015)
234 Cal.App.4th 715, 727.) Public policy favors adjudication of claims on the
merits. Nevertheless, where conduct by the party acting in pro per represents a
deliberate, strategic decision, public policy vests the court with discretion
to find no basis for relief. (Benedict v. Danner Press (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 923, 929-930; Lang v. Hochman (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1225,
1251-1252.)
 
The motion was filed more than seven (7) months from the
default entry date, and is therefore untimely. The court declines to grant the
motion on this basis. 
 
In summary, the court grants the
motion and vacates both the default and default judgment on grounds of invalid
service by publication. The motion contains a proposed copy of a proposed
answer. The court orders Buraq Investment Group, LLC to separately file and serve the proposed answer on all
appearing parties.
 
The court will concurrently
conduct the Case Management Conference.
 
Buraq Investment Group, LLC to give notice to all
parties.
