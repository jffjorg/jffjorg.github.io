And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is in response to a motion to compel the physical examination of the plaintiff, Cebert Green, and to award monetary sanctions. The plaintiff opposes the motion, stating that the parties agreed to the examination with Dr. Paul Asdourian on April 10, 2024, and that the plaintiff did not argue that the defendants are entitled to a defense medical examination. The defendants did not file a response.

The Judge declines to rule on the motion at this time, citing the agreement between the parties to the physical examination. The hearing on the motion is continued to a future date, at which time the parties will have had an opportunity to complete the examination and potentially render the motion moot. The defendants are ordered to notify the Court of the outcome of the examination and whether they will be taking the motion off-calendar.
