Summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Los Angeles Unified School District's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff, Seyedeh Masoumeh Razavian, slipped and fell on slippery yellow traction plates on the campus of West Valley Occupational Center, which is a public entity school district. The plaintiff alleges that a claim was properly presented via U.S. mail on November 25, 2019, but the defendant argues that the claim was not timely presented.

The judge grants summary judgment in favor of the defendant, finding that the plaintiff is barred from asserting a claim against the defendant due to the failure to timely present a claim.
