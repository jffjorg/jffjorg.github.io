And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Uber's motion to continue the trial date to January 13, 2025 or a date thereafter. The motion was filed due to ongoing discovery issues with Plaintiff Moore and Plaintiff Cruz. Plaintiff Moore has not provided responses to Uber's discovery requests, and Uber has not received records related to the spinal cord stimulator trial. The judge finds good cause to continue the trial date, citing the unresolved discovery issues and the need for additional time for the parties to complete their discovery obligations. The judge orders that the trial date be continued to a new date, and all discovery and expert cutoff dates are continued to reflect the new trial date.
