Here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling granting the defendant's motion for leave to file a first amended answer to include an affirmative defense based on prelitigation settlement of the plaintiff's claims. The defendant had initially sought to file the amended answer to include this defense, but the motion was initially denied due to procedural defects. The Court found that the defendant's proposed amendment was proper and necessary, and that there was no prejudice to the plaintiff in allowing the amendment. The defendant must file a separate copy of the proposed amended answer within ten days of the date of this order. The parties are encouraged to meet and confer to reach an agreement.
