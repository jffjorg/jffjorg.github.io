The Complaint alleges as follows: On July 18, 2019, Plaintiff and Defendants entered into a written loan agreement for $60,000.00, interest free. (Compl. ¶9.) Defendants agreed to pay Plaintiff back within six (6) months. (Id.) In order to induce Plaintiff into loaning Defendant Dayanoff the money, Defendant The Fairway Apartments 9, LLC (FA9) represented it would guarantee the loan by providing Plaintiff with a check dated July 18, 2019 for $60,000.00 and would keep in full in its account at all times so that upon expiration of the six (6) month loan term, Plaintiff could deposit the check and secure payment. (Id.) On or about January 19, 2020, after the six (6) month loan term had passed, Plaintiff approached Defendant Dayanoff requesting repayment on the loan. (Compl. ¶ 10.) Defendant Dayanoff represented that the money was tied up in a parcel of real property referred to as the Hancock Park Property that would be sold imminently, and Plaintiff could be paid in full upon sale. (Id.) Defendant Dayanoff further told Plaintiff that Fairway had funds in its account sufficient to pay the $60,000.00 but if Plaintiff cashed the check now, it would harm his business. (Id.) Defendants never informed Plaintiff the Hancock Property had been sold sometime in 2021. (Compl. ¶ 11.)  Plaintiff alleges approaching Defendant Dayanoff requesting repayment of the $60,000.00 but he refused. (Id.) Plaintiff attempted to deposit the security check and it was rejected. (Id.) PROCEDURAL HISTORY On March 6, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Complaint asserting five causes of action: 1. Breach of Written Contract; 2. Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; 3. Unjust Enrichment; 4. Common Count – Account Stated; and 5. Fraud On June 20, 2023, Defendant David Dayanoff and Shulamit Dayanoff filed a Cross-Complaint Plaintiff and ROES 1 through 5, asserting five causes of action: 1. Usury 2. Failure to Record a Reconveyance 3. TILA 4. B&P Code sec. 17200 et seq; and 5. Declaration of Rights On November 27, 2023, Defendant/Cross-Complainant David Dayanoff filed this Motion to Quash Deposition Notice and Protective Order. The motion is unopposed.  DISCUSSIONDefendant/Cross-Complainant FA9 moves to quash the deposition notice of FA9’s PMK.“In the case of the production of a party to the record of any civil action or proceeding or of a person for whose immediate benefit an action or proceeding is prosecuted or defended or of anyone who is an officer, director, or managing agent of any such party or person, the service of a subpoena upon any such witness is not required if written notice requesting the witness to attend before a court, or at a trial of an issue therein, with the time and place thereof, is served upon the attorney of that party or person. The notice shall be served at least 10 days before the time required for attendance unless the court prescribes a shorter time.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987, subd. (b).)  Similarly, pursuant the Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.270, subdivision (a) states in pertinent part: “An oral deposition shall be scheduled for a date at least 10 days after service of the deposition notice.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.270, subd. (a).) “If a subpoena requires the attendance of a witness or the production of books, documents, electronically stored information, or other things before a court, or at the trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon motion reasonably made by any person described in subdivision (b), or upon the court’s own motion after giving counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard, may make an order quashing the subpoena entirely, modifying it, or directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall declare, including protective orders.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1, subd. (a).) Here, Plaintiff served a deposition notice for FA9’s PMK on November 3, 2023 setting a deposition for November 14, 2023. (Motion, Exh. I.) The motion to quash is denied.Although Plaintiff also argues FA9’s attorney should be disqualified, Plaintiff must file a motion to disqualify.FA9 also moves for a protective order as to Plaintiff’s requests for production numbers 2, 4, 10, 7, and 9-30.“Before, during, or after a deposition, any party, any deponent, or any other affected natural person or organization may promptly move for a protective order. The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.420, subd. (a).) “The court, for good cause shown, may make any order that justice requires to protect any party, deponent, or other natural person or organization from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.420, subd. (b).) Here, FA9 argues that requests for production numbers 2, 4, 10, 7, and 9-30 amount will cause it  annoyance, oppression, undue burden, and undue expense. The Court agrees with FA9 for the same reasons as in Dayanoff’s motion to quash. FA9’s motion for a protective order is granted.The Court declines to impose sanctions.DATED:  May 14, 2024______________________Hon. Jill Feeney Judge of the Superior Court
