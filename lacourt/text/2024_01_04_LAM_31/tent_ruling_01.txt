PETITION
TO APPROVE MINOR’S COMPROMISE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Petitioner
Abel Sanchez Vargas
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     No opposition 
 
 
            On December 21, 2023, Claimant, Sebastian Sanchez, a minor,
by and through his parent and guardian ad litem, Petitioner, Abel Sanchez
Vargas, filed this petition to approve compromise of pending action or
proceeding with Defendants, AQP Management, Inc., Joel Estrada, and Gordon Cole,
LLC. Claimant has agreed to release his claims against Defendants in exchange
for $25,000.  If approved, $3,125 will be
used for attorney’s fees and $74.55 will be used for other expenses, leaving a
settlement balance of $21,800.45 for Claimant to be invested in a single premium
deferred annuity, subject to withdrawal only on authorization of the court. The
terms and conditions of the annuity are specified in Attachment 18b(3).
            
            Court
approval is required for all settlements of a minor’s claim.  (Probate Code §§ 3500, 3600, et seq.; Code Civ. Proc. § 372.)  The petition must be verified and “must
contain a full disclosure of all information that has any bearing on the
reasonableness of the compromise, covenant, settlement, or disposition.”¿ (Cal.
Rules of Court, rule 7.950.)¿¿
 
            The
Court has reviewed the Petition and finds the settlement amount is fair and
reasonable, as is the request for attorney’s fees. 
 
            Accordingly,
the Petition is GRANTED.
 
Dated:   January 4, 2024
