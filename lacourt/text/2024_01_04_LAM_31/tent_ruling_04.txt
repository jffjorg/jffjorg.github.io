DEMURRER
WITHOUT MOTION TO STRIKE



 
MOVING PARTY:               Defendant
California Physicians’ Service d/b/a Blue Shield of California
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Plaintiff Dylan
Scott Perry
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
            On June 22,
2023, Plaintiff, Dylan Scott Perry, filed this action against Defendant, California
Physicians’ Service d/b/a Blue Shield of California, alleging that Defendant
intentionally cancelled Plaintiff’s health insurance policy.  As a result,
Plaintiff suffered emotional and physical distress, as well as monetary
damages.  The operative First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) was filed on July
13, 2023.  Plaintiff is self-represented.  
 
            On September
8, 2023, Defendant filed this Demurrer and Motion to Strike portions of the FAC.
 Plaintiff filed an Opposition.  Defendant replied.[1]
 
II.        LEGAL STANDARD FOR DEMURRER  
 
“The primary function of a
pleading is to give the other party notice so that it may prepare its case [citation], and a defect in
a pleading that otherwise properly notifies a party cannot be said to affect
substantial rights.” (Harris v. City of Santa Monica (2013) 56 Cal.4th
203, 240.) 
“A¿demurrer¿tests the legal sufficiency of the factual
allegations in a complaint.” (Ivanoff v. Bank of America, N.A.¿(2017) 9 Cal.App.5th 719, 725.) The Court looks to whether
“the complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause
of action or discloses a complete defense.” (Id.) The Court does not “read
passages from a complaint in isolation; in reviewing a ruling on a demurrer, we
read the complaint ‘as a whole and its
parts in their context.’ [Citation.]” (West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 804.)  The Court “assume[s] the truth of the properly
pleaded factual allegations, facts that
reasonably can be inferred from those expressly pleaded and matters of which judicial notice has been
taken.” (Harris, supra, 56 Cal.4th p. 240.) “The court does not, however, assume the truth of
contentions, deductions or conclusions of law. [Citation.]” (Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1358.) 
 
A demurrer may be brought if insufficient facts are stated
to support the cause of action asserted. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10, subd.
(e).) “A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a
complaint is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified
under modern discovery procedures.” (Khoury v. Maly’s of California,
Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.)   


Where the complaint contains substantial factual
allegations sufficiently apprising defendant of the issues it is being asked to
meet, a demurrer for uncertainty will be overruled or plaintiff will be given
leave to amend. (Williams v. Beechnut Nutrition Corp. (1986) 185
Cal.App.3d 135, 139, fn. 2.) Leave to amend must be allowed where there is
a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy
(1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.) The burden is on the complainant to show the
Court that a pleading can be amended successfully.  (Ibid.)

IV.       DISCUSSION
 
            Meet and Confer
 
            Defense counsel has satisfied the
meet and confer requirement.¿ (Declaration of Jason Y. Wu, ¶ 4.)¿¿¿¿ 
            
            Analysis
 
            Defendant argues the FAC is barred
by claim preclusion.  The Court agrees.
 
            “Res judicata describes
the preclusive effect of a final judgment on the merits. Res judicata, or claim
preclusion, prevents relitigation of the same cause of action in a second suit
between the same parties or parties in privity with them.  A predictable doctrine of res judicata
benefits both the parties and the courts because it seeks to curtail multiple
litigation causing vexation and expense to the parties and wasted effort and
expense in judicial administration.”  (Consumer
Advocacy Group, Inc. v. ExxonMobil Corp.¿(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 675, 683
[cleaned up].)   
 
            “A prior judgment is
not¿res¿judicata¿on a subsequent action unless three¿elements¿are
satisfied:¿‘(1) the issues decided in the prior adjudication are identical with
those presented in the later action; (2) there was a final judgment on the
merits in the prior action; and (3) the party against whom the plea is raised
was a party or  in privity with a party
to the prior adjudication. [Citation.]”  (Id.
at pp. 685-86.)  “To prevent piecemeal litigation, the doctrine of res
judicata also applies to bar a second suit arising out of the same factual
situation involving matters which were relevant and within the same scope of
the first action, which thus could have been raised in the first suit.
[Citation.]”  (Duffy v. City of Long
Beach (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 1352, 1257-58.) 
 
            1. Same Parties or
Parties in Privity  
 
            The amended complaint
filed in Perry v. Blue Shield of California, Los Angeles Superior Court,
Case No. 22STCV27904 (the “Prior Action”), demonstrates the Prior Action and
this action involve the same parties.   As in the Prior Action, Plaintiff and
Defendant are the only parties.  (RJN No.
6.)  
 
            The first element is
satisfied.  
 
            2. Same Cause(s) of
Action  
 
            “To determine whether
two proceedings involve identical causes of action for purposes of claim
preclusion, California courts have ‘consistently applied the “primary rights”
theory.’ [Citation.] Under this theory, ‘[a] cause of action…arises out of an
antecedent primary right and corresponding duty by the person on whom the duty
rests. “Of these elements, the primary right and duty and the delict or wrong
combined constitute the cause of action in the legal sense of the term…” ’
[Citation.] (Boeken v. Phillip Morris USA, Inc. (2010) 48 Cal.4th 788,
797-98.) In other words, “a cause of action consists of (1) a primary right
possessed by the plaintiff, (2) a corresponding duty devolving upon the
defendant, and (3) a delict or wrong done by the defendant which consists of a
breach of the primary right.” (Villacres v. ABM Industries, Inc. (2010)
189 Cal.App.4th 562, 576.)  “As far as its content is concerned, the
primary right is simply the plaintiff's right to be free from the particular
injury suffered…” (Id. at pp. 575-76.)            
 
            In the Prior Action,
Plaintiff alleged that “Blue Shield of California illegally cancelled my
insurance policy without notice,” and that such cancellation “caused
[Plaintiff] emotional distress.”  (RJN
No. 2.)  In this action, Plaintiff
alleges “Blue Shield cancelled my policy in violation of our contract,” and
that “[i]n doing so, they Intentionally Inflicted Emotional/Physical
Distress.”  (FAC, p. 2.)  The FAC also seeks “compensatory punitive
damages” for unspecified violations of the Constitution and Plaintiff’s “civil
rights.”  (FAC, p. 5.)  The primary right involved in the Prior
Action and this action is the right to be free from the physical and emotional
harm allegedly caused by Defendant when it cancelled Plaintiff’s insurance
policy. Although breach of contract and unspecified civil rights violation were
not alleged in the Prior Action, they are based on a violation of the same
primary rights and thus could have been raised in the Prior Action.  (Villacres, supra, 189
Cal.App.4th at p. 576.)  Plaintiff’s claims in the Prior Action and in
this action arise from the same event and set of facts. 
 
            The second element is
satisfied.  
 
            3. Judgment on the
Merits
 
            “A judgment is on the
merits for purposes of res judicata ‘if the substance of the claim is tried and
determined…’ [Citation.]” (Johnson v. City of Loma Linda (2000) 24
Cal.4th 61, 77.) “Stated another way, ‘[t]he judgment is on the merits if it is
based on the substantive law, and determines that a plaintiff has no cause of
action…’” (Boccardo v. Safeway Stores, Inc. (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 1037,
1042.)  Res judicata may be raised even when the prior judgment resulted
from the sustaining of a demurrer if the judgment was “ ‘on the merits.’ ” (Boyd
v. Freeman (2017) 18 Cal.App.5th 847, 855.) “A judgment based upon the
sustaining of a demurrer for technical or formal defects is not on the merits
and thus is not a bar to the filing of the new action. [Citation.] ‘On the
other hand, it is generally held that a demurrer which is sustained for failure
of the facts alleged to establish a cause of action is a judgment on the
merits. However, this is only true if the same facts are pleaded in the second
action [citation], or if, although different facts are pleaded, the new
complaint contains the same defects as the former.’ [Citation.]” (Id.; see
also Boccard, supra, 132 Cal.App.3d at p. 1042 [“The
judgment is not on the merits if it is based merely on rules of procedure and
determines only that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in the particular
action; e.g., dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, or judgment after special
demurrer sustained”].)  
 
            In the Prior Action, Defendant’s
demurrer to the amended complaint was sustained without leave to amend for failure
to state a claim.  (RJN No. 5.)  Thereafter, the court in the Prior Action
entered judgment in favor of Defendant. 
(RJN No. 9.)  As discussed above,
Plaintiff alleges the same essential facts in both actions.  Thus, the judgment of dismissal following the
sustaining of the demurrer in the Prior Action was on the merits.  
 
            The third element is
satisfied.  
 
V.          CONCLUSION
            
Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff’s action is barred by the
doctrine of res judicata.  Plaintiff’s
opposition does not advance any argument that directs a different result.  Defendant California Physicians’ Service
d/b/a Blue Shield of California’s Demurrer is SUSTAINED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND.  The First Amended Complaint is DISMISSED.
 
The motion to strike is moot.
 
Demurring party to give notice.
