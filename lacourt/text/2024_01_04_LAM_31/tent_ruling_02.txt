MOTION
FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES



 
MOVING PARTY:               Plaintiff
Courtney Lee
 
RESPONDING PARTY:     Defendant FCA US
LLC
 
 
I.          BACKGROUND
 
On January 13, 2022, Plaintiff, Courtney Lee, filed this
action against Defendant, FCA US LLC, for violation of the Song-Beverly
Consumer Warranty Act, Civil Code § 1790, et seq. Defendant filed an Answer to
the Complaint on February 16, 2022.  
 
On May 19, 2023, Defendant served, and Plaintiff accepted,
an Offer to Compromise and Acceptance Under Code of Civil Procedure section
998.  Plaintiff filed a Notice of Settlement on May 22, 2023. 
 
On December 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed this Motion for
Attorney’s Fees.  
 
Defendant filed an opposition.  Plaintiff replied. 
 
II.        DISCUSSION 
            Evidentiary
Objections
            Defendant
objects to Exhibits 2-6 of the Declaration of Richard M. Wirtz.  Plaintiff objects to portions of the
Declaration of Michael J. Gregg, as well as Exhibits, B, D, E, G-I, and Q-X
attached to the Gregg Declaration.  As
the objections are not material to the disposition of this motion, the Court
declines to rule on the parties’ objections.
             Analysis
            Plaintiff
seeks a total award of $80,524.50 in attorney’s fees.  The requested award includes a 1.5
multiplier.
            On May 19,
2023, the parties agreed to settle the matter. 
(Wirtz Decl., Ex. 7, at ¶ 3.)  The settlement provides for
attorney’s fees by motion under Civil Code section 1794.  (Id.)
Civil Code section 1794, subdivision (d) provides:
(d) If the
buyer prevails in an action under this section, the buyer shall be allowed by
the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate
amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time
expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by
the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.


(Civ. Code, § 1794, subd. (d) [emphasis added].)
 
            The
parties do not dispute that Plaintiff is the prevailing party under the
Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. 
Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney
fees as the prevailing party.  The only
matter at issue is the reasonableness of the fees requested.
 
The determination of reasonable amount of attorney fees is
within the sound discretion of trial courts. (PLCM Group v. Drexler
(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095; Akins v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. (2000)
79 Cal.App.4th 1127, 1134.) “The determination of what constitutes a reasonable
fee generally ‘begins with the ‘lodestar,’ i.e., the number of hours reasonably
expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate….’”  “[T]he lodestar is the basic fee for
comparable legal services in the community; it may be adjusted by the court
based on factors including, as relevant herein, (1) the novelty and difficulty
of the questions involved, (2) the skill displayed in presenting them, (3) the
extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the
attorneys, (4) the contingent nature of the fee award….”  (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc.
(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)  In
setting the hourly rate for an attorney fees award, courts are entitled to
consider the rate of “‘fees customarily charged by that attorney and others in
the community for similar work.’”  (Bihun
v. AT&T Information Systems, Inc. (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 976, 997
[affirming rate of $450 per hour], overruled on other grounds by Lakin v.
Watkins Associated Indus. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 664.) The burden is on the
party seeking attorney fees to prove reasonableness of the fees.  (Center for Biological Diversity v. County
of San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 615.)
 
The Court has broad discretion in determining the amount of
a reasonable attorney’s fee award which will not be overturned absent a
“manifest abuse of discretion, a prejudicial error of law, or necessary
findings not supported by substantial evidence.”  (Bernardi v. County of Monterey
(2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1393-94.) 
The Court need not explain its calculation of the amount of attorney’s
fees awarded in detail; identifying the factors considered in arriving at the
amount will suffice.  (Ventura v. ABM
Industries Inc. (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 258, 274-75.)
            1.  Reasonable Hourly Rate
Two
firms worked on this matter for Plaintiff: JSGM Law LLP and Wirtz Law.  This involved work by attorneys Guy Mizrahi, Pouyan
Bohloul, Amy Rotman, Jessica R. Underwood, and Alana Mellgren, billing at rates
of $525, $395, $550, $550, and $450 per hour, respectively. (Mizrahi Decl., ¶¶ 11,
12; Wirtz Decl., ¶¶ 15-17.)  Supporting
staff also billed a portion of the hours at $300 and $250 per hour.  (Wirtz Decl., ¶¶ 18-23.)
Defendant argues that
hourly billing rates ranging between $395 to $550 for attorneys and $250 to
$300 for paralegals is excessive and unsupported.  (Opp., p. 5.)
            Based
upon general prevailing rates in the Los Angeles area for this type of
litigation, the Court finds the reasonable rate for attorney billing is as
follows: for Lodestar purposes, the Court will award a “blended” hourly rate of
$500.00 per hour.  (See, e.g., Mikhaeilpoor
v. BMW of North America (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 240 [trial court has
discretion to award a “blended hourly rate” for attorney’s fees motion].)  The Court further finds the reasonable rate
for paralegal billing to be $200.00 per hour.  This determination considers the complexity of
the case, the quality of services provided, and the attorneys’ experience.
            2.  Number
of Hours Reasonably Expended
Plaintiff’s records reflect a total of 144.4
hours billed, which includes an expected 14.4 hours to review the opposition,
draft a reply, and appear at the hearing for this motion, and an estimated 3.3
hours for Defendant’s anticipated motion to strike/tax costs.  (Wirtz Decl., ¶¶ 51, 52, Exs. 26, 27.) 
 
“[I]t is the burden of the challenging party to
point to the specific items challenged [within the moving party’s verified
billing invoice], with a sufficient argument and citations to evidence.  General arguments that fees claimed are
excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.”  (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230
Cal.App.4th 459, 488.)  
 
Defendant objects to Plaintiff’s counsel’s use
of block billing, excessive time spent on tasks which Defendant asserts were routine
filings and template discovery, and for duplicative work.  (Opp., pp. 7-8.)  Defendant also objects to tasks performed by
attorneys billing at high rates, such as Mr. Mizrahi’s billing for preparing
form discovery.  Defendant submits that a
member of the support staff, and not Mr. Mizrahi, should have taken care of
this administrative task. This Court agrees with these observations in
considerable part.  
 
The
Court appreciates that this case progressed towards trial.  Along the way, Plaintiff served and responded
to standard written discovery, filed a motion to compel, filed then withdrew a
motion to compel further, participated in mediation, and prepared motions in
limine for trial.  (Mot., pp. 1-4.)  Defendant also represents that it will not
file a motion to strike or tax costs.  There
has been little law and motion practice.
 
Moreover, there was nothing particularly complex
or unique about this case.  The issues
involved were applicable to other consumers’ vehicles, thereby triggering
economies of scale in terms of Plaintiff’s counsel’s efficiency in litigating
this type of lemon law case.  Both lead
attorneys are highly experienced in Song-Beverly litigation.  (See Mizrahi Decl., ¶¶ 10-11; Wirtz Decl., ¶¶ 8-12.)
 Litigating this matter should not have
required anything more than slight factual modification to existing
boilerplate.  The Court also notes that
two law firms, five attorneys, and six paralegals working on this case is not
reasonable.
 
Considering these facts, the Court agrees that
in some instances, the time quoted is excessive or unreasonable under the
circumstances. 
 
Based on the foregoing, and in view of the
totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that the total amount of
reasonable attorney’s fees in this case, using a lodestar methodology, is $48,000.
 This was calculated by (1) multiplying the
hourly rate of $500.00 by 80 hours, which the Court deems to be the total
amount of reasonable attorney’s fees expended in this matter, and (2)
multiplying the hourly rate of $200.00 by 40 hours, which the Court deems to be
the total number of reasonable paralegal’s fees expended in this matter.
 
The Court in its discretion declines to apply
a multiplier given this Song-Beverly case did not involve novel or complex
issues of law.  
III.       CONCLUSION
            Plaintiff
is awarded attorney’s fees in the total sum of $48,000. 
            Moving
party to give notice.
