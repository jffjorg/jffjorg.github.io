```

And here is an English-text summary of the Judge's tentative ruling:

The court has sustained Defendant's demurrer to Plaintiff's amended complaint without leave to amend, dismissing the action. The court has found that the doctrine of res judicata applies, as the same essential facts are pleaded in both the Prior Action and this action, and the prior judgment in the Prior Action was on the merits. The court has determined that the primary right involved in both actions is the right to be free from the physical and emotional harm allegedly caused by Defendant when it cancelled Plaintiff's insurance policy. As the same cause of action is being relitigated, the court has found that claim preclusion applies, and the action is barred.
