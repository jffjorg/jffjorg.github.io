And here is the English-text summary:

Judge Kerry Bensinger's tentative ruling in the case of Courtney Lee v. FCA US LLC (Case No. 22STCV01555) concerns a motion for attorney's fees filed by the plaintiff. The court has reviewed the parties' submissions and concludes that the plaintiff is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney's fees as the prevailing party under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act. The court has considered the hourly billing rates and the number of hours billed by the plaintiff's counsel, as well as the complexity of the case and the quality of services provided. The court awards attorney's fees in the total sum of $48,000, which is lower than the requested $80,524.50. The court declines to apply a multiplier, as the case did not involve novel or complex issues of law.
