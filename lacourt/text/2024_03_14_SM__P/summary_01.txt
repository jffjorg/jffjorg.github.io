And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the motions for summary adjudication brought by defendants Douglas Emmett, Inc. and Barrington Pacific, LLC. The motions seek to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims for punitive damages.

The judge has ruled that the defendants have presented sufficient evidence to meet their initial burden on summary judgment, but the burden of proof shifts to the plaintiffs to show a triable issue of fact. The judge notes that while the defendants implemented fire safety measures, the plaintiffs have alleged that these measures were flawed and that the defendants' conduct was despicable.

The judge has also ruled that the defendants' CEO, Jordan Kaplan, serving as CEO of both DEM and DEI, without more, is insufficient to expose the parent company to liability for its subsidiaries' acts. However, the judge has found that there is substantial evidence that DEM acted as DEI's agent with respect to Barrington Plaza and that DEI was involved in the day-to-day management of safety issues. As a result, the judge has denied the defendants' motions for summary adjudication.

The judge has also overruled several of the plaintiffs' objections to the defendants' motions and sustained others. The judge has also denied the defendants' objection to the joinder of the motions.
