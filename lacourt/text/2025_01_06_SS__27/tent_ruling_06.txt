Background
This
case involves an incident that occurred on January 19, 2022. Plaintiff Chloe
Sanchez, a paramedic, was involved in a motor vehicle collision while riding in
the back of a marked paramedic vehicle with active lights and sirens. Defendant
Marcus Kyle Sy, operating a Los Angeles County Sheriff’s vehicle, allegedly
failed to stop at an intersection and collided with the paramedic vehicle,
resulting in injuries to Plaintiff’s back, neck, and head. On September 7,
2022, Plaintiff filed the present case. On February 2, 2022, the case was
consolidated with Case No. 22NWCV01480.
On
October 14, 2024, Defendant served a deposition subpoena to Fullerton College
seeking:
All
education and school records, including but not limited to applications,
attendance records, grade reports, evaluations, discipline records, medical
records, special accommodations, tests, certificates, awards, and diplomas
regarding Plaintiff.
On
November 8, 2024, Plaintiff’s counsel served an objection to the subpoena on
Fullerton College Admissions & Records and Defendant. Plaintiff now moves
the Court to quash the subpoena on the basis that the information sought is not
relevant and would violate Plaintiff’s privacy. Defendant filed an opposition,
and Plaintiff did not file a reply.
Legal
Standard
In
Valley Bank of Nevada v. Superior Court (1975) 15 Cal.3d 652, the
California Supreme Court found that the following should be considered by the trial
court in balancing the interests between the right of civil litigants to
discover relevant facts and the right of bank customers to maintain reasonable
privacy regarding their financial affairs: “. . . the purpose of the
information sought, the effect that disclosure will have on the parties and on
the trial, the nature of the objections urged by the party resisting
disclosure, and ability of the court to make an alternative order which may
grant partial disclosure, disclosure in another form, or disclosure only in the
event that the party seeking the information undertakes certain specified
burdens which appear just under the circumstances.” (Id. at 658.)¿¿¿ 
Although
relevance is typically construed liberally (see Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co.
v. Superior Court (1970) 2 Cal.3d 161, 169), the standard is more stringent
when a party is attempting to discover documents which are constitutionally
protected by the right to privacy:¿¿¿¿ 
¿[E]ven
when discovery of private information is found directly relevant to the issues
of ongoing litigation, it will not be automatically allowed; there must then be
a careful balancing of the compelling public need for discovery against the
fundamental right of privacy.¿ . . . [I]f an
intrusion on the right of privacy is deemed necessary under the circumstances
of a particular case, any such intrusion should be the minimum intrusion
necessary to achieve its objective . . . [meaning] the least intrusive means to
satisfy the interest. Mere convenience of means or cost will not satisfy that
test for that would make expediency and not the compelling interest the
overriding value.¿ (Lantz v. Superior
Court (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1839, 1854-1855 [internal quotes and citations
omitted].)¿¿ 
¿       This is true even where the party
asserting the right to privacy is the party who brought the suit.¿
(See Vinson v. Superior Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d 833, 842 [“While the
filing of a lawsuit may implicitly bring about a partial waiver of one’s
constitutional right of associational privacy, the scope of such waiver must be
narrowly rather than expansively construed, so that plaintiffs will not be
unduly deterred from instituting lawsuits . . . . [A]n implicit waiver of a
party’s constitutional rights encompasses only discovery directly relevant to
the plaintiff’s claim and essential to the fair resolution of the lawsuit.”].)¿¿The
burden is on the party seeking the constitutionally protected information to
establish direct relevance.¿ (Harris v. Superior
Court (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 661, 665.)¿¿¿ 
Discussion
Plaintiff
argues that the subpoenaed school records, including grades, transcripts,
financial information, and discipline files, are not relevant to the current
action because they do not have any tendency to prove or disprove a disputed
fact concerning the collision or Plaintiff’s injuries. Plaintiff asserts that
medical records, not school records, are the appropriate source of evidence
regarding the claimed head injury. 
However,
Plaintiff is alleging wage loss and loss of earning capacity in the complaint.
(Complaint at pg. 3.) Plaintiff has also alleged that she suffered a traumatic
brain injury resulting in cognitive difficulties, specifically issues with
concentration and focus, which Plaintiff claims have impacted her educational
progress and ability to study.
Furthermore,
Plaintiff testified that her education is closely tied to her career
advancement and earning capacity as a nurse. Plaintiff completed an associate
degree at Fullerton College in 2019 and is currently enrolled in a Bachelor of
Arts program in kinesiology at Fullerton College, with approximately one year
remaining until graduation. (Deposition at 14:1-12.) Plaintiff also testified
that she enrolled at Stanbridge University in Irvine to obtain an LVN license
and plans to pursue further education for an RN license. (See Exhibit “3” at
13:22-14:12; 35:2-36:10.)
Given
Plaintiff’s claims of cognitive impairments and her stated educational and
career goals, her school records are relevant to assess both the extent of her
alleged injuries and its impact on her earning capacity. For example,
Plaintiff’s academic records, including grades and test scores, can show
whether her performance declined after the injury. Attendance records may
reveal increased absences, which could indicate issues with focus or fatigue.
Additionally, any special accommodations, such as extra time for exams, could
reflect academic challenges caused by the injury. Certificates, awards, and
diplomas could demonstrate Plaintiff’s ability to succeed post-injury, while
incomplete programs or unearned certifications may support her claims of
diminished earning capacity.
Although
the Court finds that the majority of the requested documents are directly
relevant, with no less intrusive means of obtaining the information, it
recognizes the need to balance Defendant’s interest in discovery with
Plaintiff’s constitutional right to privacy. Accordingly, the Court will limit
disclosure to ensure that only information directly relevant to Plaintiff’s
claims is produced.
With
respect to medical records, the Court will allow disclosure only of those
records related to the body parts at issue—Plaintiff’s back, neck, and head—and
her alleged traumatic brain injury and associated symptoms, such as cognitive
difficulties and inability to focus. 
Regarding
discipline records, the Court finds that disclosure should be limited to
records directly related to academic performance, such as tardiness, failure to
complete assignments, or similar issues that could affect grades or educational
progress. Discipline records unrelated to academic performance, such as
personal conduct violations, administrative infractions, or matters involving
non-academic campus rules, have no direct bearing on Plaintiff’s ability to
succeed academically or her alleged cognitive impairments. Defendant has not
provided sufficient justification for extending the scope of discipline records
beyond those directly relevant to Plaintiff’s academic performance or earning
potential.
