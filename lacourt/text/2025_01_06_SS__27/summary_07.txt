And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

Judge Lee S. Arian has issued a tentative ruling granting the City of Los Angeles's motion for judgment on the pleadings. The City argued that the plaintiff's complaint was filed after the statute of limitations expired under the Government Claims Act. The relevant timeline shows that the auto accident occurred on May 9, 2022, and the plaintiff submitted a Government Claim for damages on May 23, 2022. The City rejected the claim on June 2, 2022, and provided written notice advising the plaintiff of the six-month statute of limitations for filing a lawsuit. The plaintiff filed the complaint on August 11, 2023, well beyond the six-month limitations period. The Court finds that the complaint is jurisdictionally barred by the statute of limitations and grants the City's motion.
