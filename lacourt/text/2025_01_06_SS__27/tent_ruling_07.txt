  PLEADINGS IS GRANTED
 
Dept. 27
1:30 p.m.
January 6, 2024






Background
Defendant
City of Los Angeles moves the Court for judgment on the pleadings on the basis
that the present action was filed after the statute of limitations expired
under the Government Claims Act. The pertinent timeline is as follows:

May 9, 2022 – Auto accident
     allegedly involving Plaintiff and Defendant occurred.
May 23, 2022 – Plaintiff submitted
     a Government Claim to the City of Los Angeles.
June 2, 2022 – The City of Los
     Angeles rejected Plaintiff’s Government Claim and provided notice of the
     six-month statute of limitations for filing a complaint.
December 2, 2022 – Deadline for
     Plaintiff to file a complaint (six months after rejection of Government
     Claim). August 11, 2023 – Plaintiff filed the complaint.

Legal
Standard¿¿¿ 
A defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings may be made
after the time to demur has expired and an answer has been filed. (CCP §
438(f).) A motion by a defendant may be made on the grounds that (1) the court
“lacks jurisdiction of the subject of one or more of the causes of action
alleged” or (2) the complaint or cross-complaint “does not state facts
sufficient to constitute a cause of action against that defendant.” (CCP §
438(c).)¿¿¿ 
“A motion for judgment on the pleadings has the same function as a
general demurrer, and hence attacks only defects disclosed on the face of the
pleadings or by matters that can be judicially noticed.” (Cloud v. Northrop
Grumman Corp. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 995, 999.) “A motion for judgment on
the pleadings is akin to a general demurrer; it tests the sufficiency of the
complaint to state a cause of action.” (Wise v. Pacific Gas and Elec. Co.
(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 725, 738.)¿¿¿ 
¿¿¿      In a demurrer, a
court generally confines itself to the pleading but, as appropriate, may extend
its consideration to matters subject to judicial notice. “[W]hen the
allegations of the complaint contradict or are inconsistent with such facts, we
accept the latter and reject the former. We give the same precedence to facts
evident from exhibits attached to the pleading. (Hill v. Roll Internat.
Corp. (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 1295, 1300.)¿ Furthermore, any
allegations that are contrary to the law or to a fact of which judicial notice
may be taken will be treated as a nullity. (Interinsurance Exchange v.
Narula (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1140, 1143; Fundin v. Chicago Pneumatic
Tool Co. (1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 951, 955.) 
Government
Claims Act 
Under
the Government Claims Act, the general rule is that any party with a claim for
money or damages against a public entity must first file a claim directly with
that entity; only if that claim is denied or rejected may the claimant file a
lawsuit.  (Gov’t Code §§ 905, 945.4; City of Ontario v. Superior Court
(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 894.)¿ This provides the
public entity with an opportunity to evaluate the claim and make a
determination as to whether it will pay on the claim.¿
(Roberts v. County of Los Angeles (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 474.)¿
Failure to timely file a tort claim renders the complaint subject to demurrer.¿
¿(V.C.
v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist.¿(2006)
139 Cal.App.4th 499, 509—affirming trial court decision to sustain demurrer
without leave to amend on the ground that V.C.'s failure to timely comply with
the requirements of the Tort Claims Act barred her action.)¿ 
¿       Where a public entity provides written
notice that a claim has been rejected, the claimant has six months from the
date the notice was personally delivered or deposited in the mail to file suit.¿
(Gov’t Code § 945.6(a)(1).)¿¿¿ 
The statute of limitations imposed by section 945.6 is mandatory and must be
strictly complied with. (Cole v. Los Angeles Unified School District (1986)
177 Cal. App. 3d 1, 5.) If the claimant fails to commence an action within the
time period prescribed by section 945.6, the court is without jurisdiction to
grant relief, and dismissal of the action is required. (Id.)
Judicial
Notice 
        Defendant County of Los Angeles’s request
for judicial notice is granted. (Cal. Evid. Code § 452.) The Court takes
judicial notice of Plaintiff’s Government Claim for Damages, C22-20159, dated
May 23, 2022, and Defendant City of Los Angeles’s Rejection of Claim,
C22-20159, dated June 2, 2022.
Discussion
The
incident alleged in the complaint occurred on May 9, 2022. On May 23, 2022,
Plaintiff presented a Government Claim for damages to the City. (RJN, Exh. A.)
On June 2, 2022, the City rejected the claim and provided written notice
advising Plaintiff of the six-month statute of limitations for filing a
lawsuit, as required by Government Code § 913. (RJN, Exh. B.) On August 11,
2023, Plaintiff filed the complaint, well beyond the six-month limitations
period mandated by Government Code § 945.6(a)(1). The complaint is
jurisdictionally barred by the statute of limitations. Plaintiff also did not
file an opposition to contest Defendant’s request for judicial notice or the
timeline presented by Defendant. Accordingly, Defendant’s motion is GRANTED.
