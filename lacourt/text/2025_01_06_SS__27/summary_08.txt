Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Amtrak's motion to continue the trial to accommodate its motion for summary judgment. The trial was previously set for March 7, 2025, but Amtrak filed its motion for summary judgment on November 22, 2024, and it cannot be heard until July 11, 2025, which is more than four months after the current trial date. The judge notes that numerous courts of appeal have held that a trial court cannot refuse to consider a timely filed motion for summary judgment. Therefore, the judge has continued the trial to September 8, 2025, and the final status conference to August 25, 2025. The parties may stipulate to continue the trial-related deadlines or bring a motion to continue them.
