[TENTATIVE] MOTION
  TO CONTINUE IS GRANTED
 
Dept. 27

On September 8, 2023, Plaintiff filed the
present case. Trial is set for March 7, 2025. On November 22, 2024, Amtrak
filed and served its motion for summary judgment in a timely manner so that it
could be heard on February 11, 2025. Unfortunately, the earliest available date
on the Court’s reservation system was July 11, 2025, which is more than four
months after the current trial date. Amtrak now moves to continue the trial or
advance the hearing date for its motion for summary judgment.
Numerous
courts of appeal have held that a trial court cannot refuse to consider a
motion for summary judgment that is timely filed. "A trial court may not
refuse to hear a summary judgment filed within the time limits of [Code of
Civil Procedure] section 437c. [Citation.] Local rules and practices may not be
applied so as to prevent the filing and hearing of such a motion." (Sentry
Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 526, 529); accord First
State Inc. Co. v. Superior Court (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 324, 330
[invalidating case management order to the extent it precluded filing motions
pursuant to section 437c ]; Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Court (1988)
206 Cal.App.3d 918, 923 [local court rule that "require a party filing a
complex summary judgment motion to file the motion six months before the date
set for trial is void and unenforceable because it is inconsistent with section
437c"].) As the Sentry court explained: "We are sympathetic to
the problems the trial courts experience in calendaring and hearing the many
motions for summary judgment. However, the solution to these problems cannot
rest in a refusal to hear timely motions." (Sentry, supra, at p.
530.) 
Defendant’s
motion for summary judgment is timely filed, and therefore Defendant is
entitled to have its motion heard. The case was filed on September 8, 2023, and
the motion for summary judgment is set to be heard within the two-year period
in which cases of this nature are to be resolved. The Court finds good cause to
continue the trial to September 8, 2025, at 8:30 a.m., and the final status
conference to August 25, 2025, at 8:30 a.m.. Trial-related deadlines are not to
follow the continued trial date, as continuing the trial date to allow for the
hearing of the motion for summary judgment does not justify reopening pre-trial
activities.  The parties may, however,
stipulate to continue these dates; or, a party can bring a motion to continue
any such dates.
