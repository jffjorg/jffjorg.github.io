And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiff's motion to compel further responses from the defendant, Access Services. The motion was filed late, as the defendant's responses to discovery were served in 2022, outside the 45-day period for filing a motion to compel further responses. Additionally, the parties have not participated in an Informal Discovery Conference (IDC), which is required before a motion to compel further responses can be heard. The judge notes that the plaintiff's requests for production are overbroad, vague, and seek irrelevant information, and that the defendant's objections to the requests are valid. The judge's tentative ruling is subject to modification or rejection at the hearing set for January 6, 2025.
