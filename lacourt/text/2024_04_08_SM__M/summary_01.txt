And here is a summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for summary judgment and adjudication filed by LA Housing Outreach LLC against Natalie Medoff and others. The motion seeks to dismiss the defendants' alleged defenses and grant the plaintiff judgment as a matter of law. However, the judge has denied the motion due to several reasons. Firstly, the notice of motion was served less than 77 days before the hearing, which is less than the required notice period. Secondly, the plaintiff failed to meet its initial burden to demonstrate entitlement to judgment as a matter of law, as it did not present evidence demonstrating damages, a necessary element for two of the causes of action. Finally, the plaintiff's alternative motion for summary adjudication was also denied, as it did not dispose of the entirety of any cause of action, pled affirmative defense, claim for punitive damages, or an issue of duty.
