MOTION:                  Motion
for Summary Judgment/Adjudication
HEARING DATE:   4/8/2024
 
Legal
Standard
 
            A party may move for summary
judgment in any action or proceeding if it is contended the action has no merit
or that there is no defense to the action or proceeding. (CCP, § 437c(a).) “The
purpose of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to
cut through the parties' pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their
allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) 
 
“A party may move for summary adjudication as
to one or more causes of action within an action, one or more affirmative
defenses, one or more claims for damages, or one or more issues of duty, if the
party contends that the cause of action has no merit, that there is no
affirmative defense to the cause of action, that there is no merit to an
affirmative defense as to any cause of action, that there is no merit to a
claim for damages, as specified in Section 3294 of the Civil Code, or that
one or more defendants either owed or did not owe a duty to the plaintiff or
plaintiffs.” (CCP, § 437c(f)(1).) If a party seeks summary
adjudication as an alternative to a request for summary judgment, the request
must be clearly made in the notice of the motion. (Gonzales v. Superior
Court (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1542, 1544.)  “[A] party may move for
summary adjudication of a legal issue or a claim for damages other than
punitive damages that does not completely dispose of a cause of action,
affirmative defense, or issue of duty pursuant to” subdivision (t).
(CCP, § 437c(t).) 
 
            To
prevail, the evidence submitted must show there is no triable issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of
law. (CCP, § 437c(c).) The motion cannot succeed unless the
evidence leaves no room for conflicting inferences as to material facts; the
court has no power to weigh one inference against another or against other
evidence. (Murillo v. Rite Stuff Food Inc. (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th
833, 841.) In determining whether the facts give rise to a triable issue of
material fact, “[a]ll doubts as to whether any material, triable, issues of
fact exist are to be resolved in favor of the party opposing summary judgment…”
(Gold v. Weissman (2004) 114 Cal.App.4th 1195, 1198-99.) “In other
words, the facts alleged in the evidence of the party opposing summary judgment
and the reasonable inferences there from must be accepted as true.” (Jackson
v. County of Los Angeles (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 171, 179.) However, if
adjudication is otherwise proper the motion “may not be denied on grounds of
credibility,” except when a material fact is the witness’s state of
mind and “that fact is sought to be established solely by the [witness’s]
affirmation thereof.” (CCP, § 437c(e).) 
 
            Once
the moving party has met their burden, the burden shifts to the opposing party
“to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that
cause of action or a defense thereto.” (CCP § 437c(p)(1).) “[T]here is no obligation on the opposing party... to establish
anything by affidavit unless and until the moving party has by affidavit stated
facts establishing every element... necessary to sustain a judgment in his
favor.” (Consumer Cause, Inc. v. SmileCare (2001) 91
Cal.App.4th 454, 468.) 
 
“The pleadings play a key role in a summary
judgment motion. The function of the pleadings in a motion for summary judgment
is to delimit the scope of the issues and to frame the outer measure
of materiality in a summary judgment proceeding.” (Hutton v. Fidelity
National Title Co. (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 486, 493, quotations
and citations omitted.) “Accordingly, the burden of a defendant moving for
summary judgment only requires that he or she negate plaintiff's theories of
liability as alleged in the complaint; that is, a moving party need
not refute liability on some theoretical possibility not included in the
pleadings.” (Ibid.) 
 
Analysis
 

Plaintiff LA Housing Outreach LLC
moves for summary judgment on each cause of action of its complaint for breach
of contract, ejectment and fraud. Alternatively, Plaintiff moves for summary
adjudication of the following issue: that the “Los Angeles Municipal Code,
Chapter 15, Article 1, § 151.09(A)(7), permits plaintiff to evict defendant
Natalie Medoff and to recover possession of the Premises from defendant Natalie
Medoff, a holdover subtenant occupying the Premises after the expiration of a
fixed term and none of the defendants herein has any defense to the complaint
or to plaintiffs immediate recovery of and possession of the Premises.”
 
            The Court
lacks jurisdiction to grant the motion. Code of Civil Procedure section
437c(a)(2) requires that the notice of motion be served on all other parties to
the action at least 75 days before the hearing, plus additional days depending
on the method of service. Plaintiff served this motion on March 8, 2024, via
email. Thus, there was a required notice period of 77 days. The hearing was set
for April 8, 2024, less than 77 days from the notice. The Court therefore has
the discretion to deny the motion or set the motion for 77 days after this
hearing, but nothing else. The Court is not inclined to grant a continuance
since, as discussed below, the motion would substantively fail if considered on
the merits.  
 
As to timing of the motion, the
complaint does not bring any claims pursuant to any of summary unlawful
detainer or forcible detainer sections. Thus, the special rules for summary
judgment motions in summary proceedings would not apply. (See CCP § 437c(s),
1159 et seq.; CRC Rule 3.1351.) The claim of ejectment is a common law remedy
for property owners seeking to recover possession and damages from unlawful
occupants and as such, ejectment actions are not summary proceedings. (Rickley
v. Goodfriend (2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 1136, 1154; Titus v. Canyon Lake
Property Owners Ass'n (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 906, 914, disapproved on other
grounds by Brown v. USA Taekwondo (2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 212-213
[discussing “special relationship” tort doctrine].) 
 
Moreover, even if the Court was to
hear the motion, Plaintiff fails to meet its initial burden to demonstrate
entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. Without belaboring the point,
Plaintiff does not present evidence demonstrating damages, a necessary element for
two of the causes of action. (See Wall Street Network, Ltd. v. New York Times Co.
(2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178 [breach of contract]; Charnay v.
Cobert (2006) 145
Cal.App.4th 170, 184 [fraud].) While damages are not necessary for an ejectment
cause of action (see Baugh v. Consumers Associates, Limited (1966) 241
Cal.App.2d 672, 675), Plaintiff also seeks monetary damages of
$300,000.00, which includes lost rent based upon the ejectment cause of action.
(Compl., ¶ 31; see Prayer ¶ 1.) Plaintiff presents no material facts in
the separate statement to support any amount of damages. At best, Plaintiff
presents evidence that it has not received any rent for the subject property
since it acquired it. (UMF 25.) Instead of providing evidence showing the
amount of rent it would be entitled to, Plaintiff merely concludes in the
memorandum that it is entitled to an unspecified amount of money. Plaintiff
notes that the complaint alleges the reasonable value of the damages and
profits is the sum of $3,200.00 per month. However, the UMFs do not state this
fact, and Plaintiff does not cite any evidence supporting this valuation. Plaintiff’s
bare contentions do not meet the burden on summary judgment to demonstrate
damages with competent evidence. 
 
As to the alternative motion for summary
adjudication, the sole noticed issue would not dispose of the entirety
of any cause of action, pled affirmative
defense, claim for punitive damages, or an issue of duty. Plaintiff essentially
requests a declaratory judgment stating that “Los Angeles Municipal
Code, Chapter 15, Article 1, § 151.09(A)(7), permits plaintiff to evict
defendant Natalie Medoff and to recover possession of the Premises” and that
there is no defense thereto. Plaintiff does not cite which cause of action or
affirmative defense this might apply to. Plaintiff recognizes that Defendants have not pled an affirmative
defense under that section. Therefore, Plaintiff does not actually engage with
the pled defenses beyond the conclusory assertion that they are all invalid. Therefore,
the Court would not grant adjudication of this issue. 
 
Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
