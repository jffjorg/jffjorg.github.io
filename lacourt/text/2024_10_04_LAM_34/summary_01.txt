And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Friedman & Chapman, LLP's motion to be relieved as counsel for Miriam Ramirez, effective upon the filing of proof of service showing service of the signed order upon the client at the client's last known address. The firm has been unable to communicate with the client, who has become unresponsive, and has attempted to reach her by phone, text, and mail to discuss a settlement offer and follow up on a signed settlement release. The court finds that the requirements of California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362 have been sufficiently met, and the motion is granted.
