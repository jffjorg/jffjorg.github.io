which Defendant failed to cure.

Legal
Standard
 
The court has discretion to
allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted provided
that there is no prejudice to the client and it does not disrupt the orderly
process of 
justice. (See Ramirez v.
Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398.)
 
California Rules of Court (“CRC”) Rule 3.1362 requires (1) a notice of
motion and motion directed to the client (made on the Notice of Motion and Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form
(MC-051)); (2) a declaration stating in general terms and without compromising
the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship why a motion under Code
of Civil Procedure § 284(2) is brought instead of filing a consent under
section 284(1) (made on the Declaration
in Support of Attorney's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel—Civil form
(MC-052)); (3) service of the notice of motion and motion, the declaration, and
the proposed order on the client and on all other parties who have appeared in
the case; and (4) a proposed order relieving counsel (prepared on the Order Granting Attorney's Motion to Be
Relieved as Counsel—Civil form (MC-053)). The court may delay the effective
date of the order relieving counsel until proof of service of a copy of the
signed order on the client has been filed with the court.
 
Discussion
 
Friedman
& Chapman, LLP (“Firm”) seeks to be relieved as counsel of record for
Plaintiff (“Client”). 
 
Attorney Geoffrey
A. Bowen (“Bowen”) represents that Firm is having difficulty communicating with
Client as she has become unresponsive. (Bowen Decl., ¶¶ 2-3.) Bowen represents
that the Firm’s office staff has attempted to contact Client repeatedly by
telephone, text, and mail since mid-June of 2024 to communicate a settlement
offer and follow-up on a signed settlement release. (Id., ¶ 3.) Bowen
states the multiple occasions office staff attempted to reach Client and
Client’s failure to contact the Firm. (Id., ¶¶ 4-14.)
 
Bowen
declares that Client was served by mail of this Motion on August 7, 2024 to her
last known address. (Id., p. 1.) Proof of service of this motion on
Defendant was also provided.
 
The Court determines that the requirements of Rules of
Court Rule 3.1362 enumerated above 
have been sufficiently met. 
 
Conclusion
 
Counsel for Plaintiff Miriam
Ramirez’s (i.e., Friedman & Chapman, LLP) Motion to be Relieved as Counsel
is GRANTED, effective upon the filing of a proof of service showing 
service of the signed order
upon the Client at the Client’s last known address.
