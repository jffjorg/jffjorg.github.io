And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion filed by Plaintiffs Alex Alvarado and Patricia Alvarado to compel compliance with a subpoena for business records from A Cleaner Pool, Inc. and to impose sanctions against Defendant Michael Meadows. The judge found that the Plaintiffs failed to provide clear notice of the relief being sought and that the motion was procedurally defective. Additionally, the judge found that the Plaintiffs failed to establish that another order compelling compliance is warranted and that the requested sanctions against Mr. Meadows or A Cleaner Pool, Inc. are not warranted. The judge also denied the Meadows' request for sanctions.
