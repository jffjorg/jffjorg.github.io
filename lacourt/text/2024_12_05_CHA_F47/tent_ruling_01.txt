SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of a dispute between neighbors,
Plaintiffs Alex Alvarado and Patricia Alvarado (collectively, Plaintiffs) and
Defendants Michael Meadows and Althea Meadows (collectively, Defendants).  One of the complaints against Defendants is
that they are running a business out of their home in violation of the
CC&Rs.  (See First Amended Complaint
(FAC) ¶¶22-26).  
 
On 9/6/22, Plaintiffs filed a motion which sought an
order compelling non-party, A Cleaner Pool, Inc., to comply with Plaintiffs’
subpoena for business records. 
Additionally, Plaintiffs requested sanctions against A Cleaner Pool,
Inc. and Defendant Michael Meadows in the amount of $1,785.00.  Ultimately, on 12/21/22, the Court granted
the prior motion to compel compliance.   (See 12/9/22 and 12/21/22 Minute
Orders).  A Cleaner Pool, Inc. was ordered
to produce the documents requested in the deposition subpoena and to pay
sanctions in the amount of $1,785.00 within 30 days.  (See 12/21/22 Minute Order).  A Cleaner Pool, Inc. failed to comply with
the subpoena.  Therefore, on 4/13/23,
Plaintiffs filed a second motion which sought an order compelling A Cleaner
Pool, Inc. to comply with Plaintiffs’ subpoena for business records and sought
the imposition of sanctions against Defendant Michael Meadows.  (See 7/5/23 Minute Order).  On 7/5/23, the hearing on that motion was
placed off calendar because Plaintiffs failed to serve the motion on Michael
Meadows as Agent for Service for a Cleaner Pool, Inc. and failed to provide
clear notice of the relief being sought. 
(Id., pp.3-4).  
 
On 7/6/23, Plaintiffs filed and served a third motion
seeking an order compelling Defendant Michael Meadows
and Third-Party A Cleaner Pool, Inc. to comply with Plaintiffs’ subpoena for
business records.  Plaintiffs then
requested that the Court pierce the corporate veil and impose various sanctions
on Defendant Michael Meadows for A Cleaner Pool, Inc.’s failure to comply with
this Court’s 12/21/22 order.  (See
Motion filed 7/6/23; 9/13/23 Minute Order). 
Before the 9/13/23 hearing, the Court issued a tentative ruling denying
the motion due to improper service of the motion, failure to provide clear
notice of the relief sought, and failure to provide evidence to support the
arguments made in the motion.  At
Plaintiffs’ request, the Court amended its tentative ruling to deny the motion
without prejudice.  (See 9/13/23
Minute Order). 
 
On 9/25/23, Plaintiffs filed a fourth motion seeking an
order compelling Defendant Michael Meadows and Third-Party A Cleaner Pool, Inc.
to comply with Plaintiffs’ subpoena for business records.  Although Plaintiffs titled the motion as
their “Second Motion to Compel Compliance With a Subpoena for Business Records
from A Cleaner Pool, Inc.,” it was actually Plaintiffs’ fourth motion seeking
such relief.  (See Motion filed
9/25/23, p.1:11-13; Reply, p.6:21).  As
noted above, the second and third motions were taken off calendar and denied,
without prejudice, respectively.  
 
On 2/14/24, the Court denied the fourth motion without
prejudice.  Contrary to Plaintiffs’
assertion in the reply, the motion was not denied merely for notice
reasons.  (See Reply, p.3:3;
2/14/24 Minute Order, p.5). 
 
On 3/19/24, Plaintiffs filed and served the instant
motion seeking an order: 
 
(1) under CCP 2025.450(h), CCP 2024.480(a) and (k); CCP
2023.010(g), CCP 2020.410-2020.440, and CCP 1985.3, and CCP 1987.1 imposing
monetary sanctions against Defendant Michael Meadows in the amount of
$3,120.00; 
 
(2) requiring Defendant Michael Meadows to pay the
$1,785.00 in monetary sanctions that the Court previously Ordered A Cleaner
Pool, Inc. to pay, 
 
(3) imposing an evidentiary and/or issue sanction against
Defendant Michael Meadows that he operates A Cleaner Pool, Inc. out of his
home, that A Cleaner Pool, Inc.’s business address is Mr. Meadows’ home
address, and that he stores pool chemicals used for A Cleaner Pool, Inc.’s
business at his home address. 
 
(4) piercing A Cleaner Pool, Inc.’s corporate form and
enter orders directly against Mr. Meadows.
 
Alternatively, if the Court is unwilling to pierce the A
Cleaner Pool, Inc.’s corporate veil and issue orders directly against Mr.
Meadows, then the Alvarados request that the Court impose monetary sanctions
against A Cleaner Pool, Inc. in the amount of $3,120.00, re-Order A Cleaner
Pool, Inc. to produce the requested records free from objections; and re-Order
A Cleaner Pool, Inc. to pay the $1,785.00 monetary sanctions the Court
previously Ordered it to pay. 
 
Defendants have opposed the motion and Plaintiffs have
filed a reply to the opposition.  
 
ANALYSIS
 
This is the fifth motion the Court has reviewed related
to Plaintiffs’ subpoena for business records issued to Third-Party, A Cleaner
Pool, Inc. 
 
Plaintiffs have, again, failed to provide clear notice of
the relief being sought.  CRC 3.1110(a)
provides that “[a] notice of motion must state in the opening paragraph the
nature of the order being sought and the grounds for issuance of the
order.”  Here, although the “second” part
of the title of the motion mentions a request for terminating sanctions in
addition to or in the alternative to other sanctions, the body of the notice of
motion makes no mention Plaintiffs’ request for terminating sanctions.  (See Notice of Motion and Amended
Notice of Motion).  Despite the foregoing,
the title of the motion being as one to compel compliance with a subpoena for
business records from A Cleaner Pool, Inc. with associated sanctions, and the
introduction of the memorandum of points and authorities referring to the
instant motion as “another Motion to Compel,” the remainder of the memorandum
of points and authorities indicate that terminating sanctions or other
sanctions against Michael Meadows is the gravamen of the relief sought in the
motion, relying primarily on conduct that is unrelated to the subject subpoena.  (See Motion, Memorandum of Points
& Authorities, p.6:19-22, p.14:16-p.15:21). 
 
Additionally, in the reply filed on 11/26/24, Plaintiffs
improperly refer to their reply filed on 2/6/24 in relation to the last motion
to compel compliance which was denied without prejudice on 2/14/24.  Plaintiffs have not requested that the Court
take judicial notice of the reply filed on 2/6/24, nor is it clear how
Plaintiffs believe merely referring to the previously filed document is “in the
interest of not wasting the Court’s time” when Plaintiffs have not attached a
copy of the prior reply which forced the Court to find it in order to review it
for the hearing on current motion.  (See
Reply, p.3:6-9).
 
Similarly, in relation to their prior motions, Plaintiffs
requested that the Court take judicial notice of a Notice of Entry of Judgment
in a small claims action filed by Michael Meadows dba A Cleaner Pool.  In ruling on the prior motions, the Court
noted that the document provides no information regarding the facts leading up
to the small claims judgment.  (See
9/13/23 Minute Order, p.5; 2/14/24 Minute Order, pp.4-5).  Despite the prior ruling, Plaintiffs have
again requested judicial notice of the same document.  (See Request for Judicial Notice).  
 
The opposition to the motion argues that serving the
subpoena for business records on A Cleaner Pool, Inc. was improper because
Plaintiffs knew the corporation has been suspended for fifteen years.  (See Opposition, p.5:12-p.6:3).  However, in response to discovery served on
Mr. Meadows, individually, he claimed not to have the responsive
documents.  (See Chimoures Decl.,
Ex.1 ¶¶3.3-3.4).  Additionally, the
gravamen of the opposition to the first motion to compel compliance was that it
must be denied because it was not served on Michael Meadows as agent for
service for A Cleaner Pool, Inc.  (See
Opposition filed 11/28/22; 12/21/22 Minute Order, p.5).  If the Meadows wanted to attack the propriety
of the underlying subpoena, they should have done so in response to the first
motion.  Similarly, in opposition to the
instant motion, the Meadows’, in part, improperly attempt to reargue the merits
of the first motion granted by the Court on 12/21/22.  (See Opposition, p.8:1-p.9:28).
 
At his deposition as the person most qualified for A
Cleaner Pools, Inc., Mr. Meadows produced documents and testified in response
to identical document requests as set forth in the subject subpoena.  (See Tatikian Decl., Ex.A, 15:15-16:3,
17:4-7, 17:10-16, 17:19-18:10; 22:4-7; 22:17-23:8, 24:3-19, 25:20-26:3, 26:6-30:6,
55:9-16, 55:20-22, 56:20-24, 102:10-12, 103:3-8, 129:7-23, 130:4-6, 130:8-13, 133:15-20,
137:15-25, 140:17-141:3; Ex.B; Ex.F; Chimoures Decl., Ex.1, pdf 189-192).  Plaintiffs’ attorney stated at the deposition
that he was “asking questions off the subpoena” to “Michael Meadows as a
representative for a Cleaner Pool.”  (Tatikian Decl., Ex.A, 16:15-20).  Plaintiffs fail to explain why additional
responses and/or production are necessary. 
Plaintiffs seem to conflate the requirements for written responses to
document requests from a party to the action with a response to a subpoena for production
of business records from a third-party. 
(See Motion, p.8:16-19 whereat Plaintiffs cite no authority
requiring a third-party deponent to provide a written response indicating a
reasonable inquiry and diligent search was conducted; p.11:13-22 whereat
Plaintiffs cite Stadish (1999) 71 CA4th 1130, 1141 which concerned
responses to a request for production of documents by a party).  As such, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have
failed to establish that another order compelling compliance is warranted.    
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiffs
have also failed to establish that any of the requested sanctions against Mr.
Meadows or A Cleaner Pool, Inc. are warranted.
 
Based on the foregoing, the Court also finds that the
Meadows are not entitled to sanctions.
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion is denied. 
The Meadows’ request for sanctions is also denied.
