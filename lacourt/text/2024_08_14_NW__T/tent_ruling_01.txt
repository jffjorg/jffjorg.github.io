  Case Number:  24VECV00579    Hearing Date:   August 14, 2024    Dept:  T 24VECV00579
Frandsen v Foxman

Ex parte
application to advance: Denied.  The
court is extremely busy at the present while being in a jury trial and having a
full morning calendar.  There is no
emergency for the court to wedge this case into an already busy calendar.  The court reviewed the opposition and notes
that the defendants are willing to sign a stipulation for possession pending
the hearing.  If this is being offered at
no loss to plaintiffs, it is unclear why the offer has not been accepted.
