And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is regarding a case brought by Plaintiff Babak Zarabian against Defendants Zanna USA 3 Holdings, Inc. and Zanna USA 4 Holdings, Inc. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants cut him out of a partnership deal relating to the "Zanna" family of corporate entities. The Plaintiff is seeking to compel responses to his requests for production from the Defendants, citing that the Defendants provided responses to different discovery than what was actually at issue. However, the Defendants have since served supplemental responses, making the Motions to Compel moot. The Judge denies the Motions to Compel and declines to award sanctions. The Judge encourages counsel to submit on the tentative or appear remotely by LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
