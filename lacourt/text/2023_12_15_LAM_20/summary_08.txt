And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The defendants, Mesriani & Associates, Sanaz Imani, and Rodney Mesriani, have requested to continue the trial date from February 26, 2024, to May 13, 2024, citing a non-refundable vacation planned for Scotland to celebrate the defense counsel's mother's 90th birthday. They also argue that the parties need time for further discovery and filing of summary judgment motions. The defendants claim that all parties agree to this continuance. After considering all relevant facts and circumstances, including the proximity of the trial date, the availability of alternative means to address the problem, and the lack of opposition, the court grants the motion. The specific trial date will be discussed at the hearing, and the parties are required to give notice. The court notes that counsel are encouraged to submit their objections to the tentative ruling and appear remotely via LACourtConnect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
