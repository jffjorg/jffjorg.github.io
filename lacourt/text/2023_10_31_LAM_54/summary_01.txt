And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge denies the plaintiff's motion for sanctions against the defendant, County of Los Angeles. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant made misrepresentations in discovery regarding the phone data confiscation, but the court finds that the plaintiff has not established this claim. The court also notes that the plaintiff was able to inspect the data, which diminishes the need for sanctions. The judge references previous case law and statutes, including CCP § 2023.010(d), CCP § 2023.010(g), and CCP § 2023.030, to support the denial of the motion. The court's tentative ruling is that the plaintiff's motion is denied.
