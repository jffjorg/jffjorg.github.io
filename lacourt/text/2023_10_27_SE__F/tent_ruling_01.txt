Plaintiff
THE HUNTINGTON NATIONAL BANK’s unopposed Motion to Continue Trial and Related
Dates is GRANTED.
 
Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
No
Opposition filed as of October 26, 2023. Due by October 16, 2023. (CCP
§1005(b).) 
 
The
Court notes that a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing by Defendant Precision Forging
Dies, Inc. was FILED by Plaintiff on August 29, 2023. 
 
The
upcoming hearing dates in this action are as follows: 
 
·       
Mandatory
Settlement Conference scheduled for November 15, 2023 in Dept. SE-F. 
·       
Motion
for Summary Judgment RESERVED for December 14, 2023 in Dept. SE-C. 
·       
Trial
scheduled for January 11, 2024 in Dept. SE-F. 
 
Plaintiff
The Huntington National Bank (“Plaintiff”) moves to continue trial and the
Mandatory Settlement Conference for at least six months. Plaintiff argues that
Defendant Precision Forging Dies, Inc.’s pending bankruptcy, and Defendant Dan
Kloss’s potential bankruptcy filing justifies a continuance. In addition,
Plaintiff “intends to file” a summary judgment motion if this action is not
stayed as to Dan Kloss, but is unable to timely do so based on the current
January 11, 2023 trial date. 
 
As
indicated above, this Motion is unopposed. 
 
“Although
continuances of trials are disfavored, each request for a continuance must be
considered on its own merits. The court may grant a continuance only on an
affirmative showing of good case requiring the continuance. Circumstances that
may indicate good cause include…. (7) A significant, unanticipated change in
the status of the case as a result of which the case is not ready for trial.”
(CRC Rule 3.1332(c)(7).)  
 
This
action was filed on March 16, 2022. There has only been one previous trial
continuance in this matter, and the instant Motion is unopposed. Based on
Precision Forging Dies, Inc.’s bankruptcy filing, the Court finds that a
significant, unanticipated change in the status of the case has occurred, thus
rendering this case not ready for trial. 
 
The
Motion to Continue Trial to a date in or after July 2024 is GRANTED. The Mandatory
Settlement Conference is also CONTINUED. The Court will confer with the parties
to determine the new dates. Discovery and all related deadlines will track the
new trial date.
