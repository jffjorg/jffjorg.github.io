And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled to continue the petition for minor's compromise, filed by Kevin Cargill and others, to February 9, 2024. The petition seeks approval of a settlement with defendants Farcoh 126 LLC, Joseph Cohen, and Rescap Securities Holdings, Co., in which the minor claimant, Kobe Cargill, would receive $5,000.00 out of a total settlement amount of $295,000.00. The court notes that the settlement is fair in light of the alleged injuries sustained by the minor claimant, but cannot grant the petition because the plaintiffs failed to check the correct box for disposition of proceeds in the petition. The court requires the plaintiffs to file and serve an amended petition checking box 19(2) by February 5, 2024, in order to deposit the funds in a blocked account.
