Plaintiff Kobe Cargill
Responding
Party: None
 
T/R:      THE PETITION IS CONTINUED TO FEBRUARY 9, 2024 AT 9:00AM.
 
PLAINTIFFS TO
FILE AND SERVE AN AMENDED PETITION NO LATER THAN FEBRUARY 5, 2024. 
 
PLAINTIFFS TO NOTICE.
 
If the parties
wish to submit on the tentative, please email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with notice to opposing
counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the day of the
hearing. 
 
The Court considers the petition.  No opposition has been received.
 
Compromises of disputed claims brought by minors are governed in part by
CCP § 372. The statute allows a guardian ad litem to appear in court on behalf
of a minor claimant and gives the guardian ad litem the power to compromise the
minor’s claim “with the approval of the court in which the action or proceeding
is pending.”  A petition for court
approval of a compromise must be verified by the petitioner and must contain a
full disclosure of all information that has any bearing upon the reasonableness
of the compromise or covenant.  (CRC Rule
7.950.)
 
CRC Rule 7.952(a) requires the attendance of the petitioner and claimant
at the hearing on the compromise of the claim unless the court for good causes
dispenses with their personal appearance.
 
“Neither section 372 nor the California Rules of Court (rules 7.950
& 7.952) contemplates a noticed motion and adversary hearing when court
approval of a minor's compromise is sought. Although we need not decide the
question, it would appear that a petition to approve or disapprove a minor's
compromise may be decided by the superior court, ex parte, in chambers.”  (Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202
Cal. App. 4th 1333, 1337.)  
 
Minor Plaintiff moves for approval of a settlement with Defendants Farcoh 126 LLC, Joseph Cohen, and Rescap
Securities Holdings, Co. Minor
claimant would receive $5,000.00 out of a total settlement of $295,000.00. No
attorney’s fees or costs will be deducted from the minor claimant’s settlement
amounts.  Minor claimant’s net proceeds
are $5,000.00. 
 
This is a landlord-tenant action. The individual settlement is fair in
light of the alleged injuries sustained by minor claimant. But the Court cannot
grant the petition because Plaintiffs failed to check the correct box for
disposition of proceeds. Plaintiffs have provided a proposed order to place the
funds in a blocked account but have checked box 19(8) in the petition, which
provides that the Court will determine the means of distribution. If Plaintiffs
seek to deposit the funds in a blocked account they must submit an amended
petition checking box 19(2). It is important for the paperwork to be clear and
consistent, in the event of any issues or challenges in the future.
 
The petition is CONTINUED.
