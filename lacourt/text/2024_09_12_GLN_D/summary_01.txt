And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that the plaintiff has failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of his private nuisance claim. The judge has also determined that the plaintiff has failed to establish any irreparable harm or hardship that would warrant the issuance of a preliminary injunction.

The judge has concluded that the defendant's construction of a new structure with pilings and excavating space for a basement does not constitute a private nuisance, as the construction is in compliance with the building code and has been approved by the City of South Pasadena. The judge has also found that the plaintiff has failed to establish any expert testimony or evidence to support his claims of irreparable harm or hardship.

The judge has also noted that the plaintiff's declaration lacks sufficient expertise or qualifications to establish him as an expert witness in geology, soil issues, or fire hazards, and has therefore disregarded his opinions on these matters.

Overall, the judge has concluded that the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction is denied due to the lack of evidence supporting his claims and the failure to establish a likelihood of success on the merits.
