Martinez v. Hacienda La Puente Unified School District, et al.
Case
No. 23STCP04413
[Tentative]
Order Overruling Demurrer to Petition for Writ of Mandate
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
            Petitioner
José Martinez (“Petitioner”) filed this petition for writ of mandate against
the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District (“Respondent” or the “District”)
seeking the following: (1) A petition for a writ of mandate to compel the
District to comply with the Personnel Commission’s order to reinstate
Petitioner and award back pay, per Code of Civil Procedure section 1085(a); and
(2) A petition for a writ of mandate to compel the Personnel Commission to
amend its order to include back pay for a period of unpaid leave, per Code of
Civil Procedure section 1094.5.  Now, Respondent
demurs, arguing that the petition is barred by the 90-day statute of
limitations set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.6.  Petitioner opposes the demurrer, which is
overruled. 
 
SUMMARY OF PETITION   
 
Petitioner was employed by Respondent,
a school district, as a campus security officer from 2012 to May 5, 2022, when
Petitioner was terminated after he failed to comply with Respondent’s Covid-19
vaccine mandate policy.  (Verified
Petition for Writ of Mandate (“Pet.”) ¶ 3.) 
Petitioner alleges that Respondent terminated his employment on the
basis that Petitioner’s request for a religious exemption from the mandate
would impose an undue hardship.  (Id. ¶
4.)  Petitioner appealed the termination
to the Personnel Commission (“Commission”), which appointed a hearing officer
to preside over an evidentiary hearing. 
(Id. ¶ 6.)  On August 7, 2023, the
Commission adopted the recommendations of the hearing officer, granted
Petitioner’s appeal, and ordered Respondent to reinstate Petitioner with full
back pay and benefits from the date of his termination.  (Id. ¶ 7.) 
Petitioner alleges that Respondent has failed to comply with the
Commission’s order.  (Id. ¶ 8.)  
 
In his first cause of action,
Petitioner seeks a writ of ordinary mandate pursuant to Code of  Civil Procedure section 1085 directing
Respondent to comply with the Commission’s order to reinstate him.  (Id. ¶¶ 8-12.)  In his second cause of action, Petitioner
seeks a writ of administrative mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
section 1094.5 directing Commission to award Petitioner backpay from October
15, 2021, when Petitioner was placed on involuntary unpaid leave, rather than
from the date of his termination.  (Id.
¶¶ 23-24.)
 
STANDARD
OF REVIEW 
 
A demurrer tests the sufficiency of a
pleading, and the grounds for a demurrer must appear on the face of the
pleading or from judicially noticeable matters. (Code Civil Proc. § 430.30,
subd. (a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.) “We assume the truth of
the allegations in the complaint, but do not assume the truth of contentions,
deductions, or conclusions of law.”  (California Logistics, Inc. v. State
(2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 242, 247.) 

 
“‘A demurrer
on the ground of the bar of the statute of limitations will not lie where the
action may be, but is not necessarily barred.’ [Citations.] It must appear
clearly and affirmatively that, upon the face of the complaint, the right of
action is necessarily barred.”  (Lockley
v. Law Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91
Cal.App.4th 875, 881.)  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
            A.        First
Cause of Action: Writ of Ordinary Mandate under section 1085
 
            In
his first cause of action, Petitioner seeks to compel Respondent to comply with
the Personnel Commission’s order to reinstate Petitioner and award back pay,
per Code of Civil Procedure section 1085(a). 
“‘The statute of limitations applicable to a writ of mandamus under
[section] 1085 depends upon the nature of the obligation sought to be
enforced…. The code provisions authorizing this action are silent as to the
time within which it must be filed. [Citation.] Accordingly, the courts have
developed the rule that the question is to be resolved not by the remedy prayed
for but by the nature of the underlying right or obligation that the action
seeks to enforce.’”  (Kao v. Department of Corrections &
Rehabilitation (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 1326, 1332.)  
 
In this case, Petitioner alleges Respondent’s Board of
Education has a ministerial duty under Education Code section 45307 and
Commission Rule 18.4.27 to comply with the Commission’s order to reinstate
him.  (Pet. ¶¶ 8-10.)  Thus, Petitioner seeks to compel Respondent
to comply with a statutory obligation. 
“The limitation period for an action based upon a liability created by
statute, other than a penalty or forfeiture, is three years.”  (Kao, supra, 244 Cal.App.4th at 1332;
see Code Civ. Proc. § 338(a).) 
Commission adopted its decision on August 7, 2023.  (Pet. ¶ 7.) 
Petitioner filed the petition on December 6, 2023.  Accordingly, the first cause of action is
timely. 
 
Respondent argues that the 90-day statute of limitations in
Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.6 applies to a writ proceeding under
section 1085.  The cases cited by
Respondent do not support its argument. 
One case—Garner v. City of Riverside (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 510,
513—involved a petition for a writ of administrative mandate under section
1094.5.  The other two cases—Green v.
Obledo (1981) 29 Cal.3d 126, 141, fn. 10 and Ragan v. City of Hawthorne (1989)
212 Cal.App.3d 1361, 1367—acknowledged that petitions under section 1085 to
enforce a statutory obligation are subject to a three-year statute of
limitations, per Code of Civil Procedure section 338(a).  
 
            In Respondent’s reply brief,
Respondent argues: “[Section] 1094.5 is the sole remedy where a party seeks to
inquire into a final administrative order from a local agency.”  (Reply 1:25-26.)  In support of this argument—which was not
raised in the demurrer—Respondent cites Eureka Teachers Assn. v. Board of
Education (1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 353, 361, which states that “[t]he
administrative mandate procedure of section
1094.5 is to be used in all writ
cases challenging the validity of any final administrative order or decision
made as a result of a proceeding in which by law (1) a hearing is required, (2)
evidence is required to be taken, and (3) discretion in the determination of
facts is vested in the inferior board.” 
In fact, the first cause of action does not challenge the validity of
the Personnel Commission’s final administrative order but rather seeks to
compel Respondent to comply with the order. 
Therefore, the administrative mandate procedure and limitations period
of Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.6 do not apply to the first cause of
action.
 
            The court has considered
Respondent’s remaining arguments, and none is persuasive.  Based upon the foregoing, the court overrules
the demurrer to the first cause of action in the petition for writ of mandate. 
 
            B.        Second
Cause of Action: Writ for Administrative Mandate under section 1094.5
 
            In his second cause of action,
Petitioner seeks review of the Personnel Commission’s decision, arguing that
the Personnel Commission abused its discretion when it awarded Petitioner
backpay from the date of his termination (May 5, 2022) rather than the date
when he was placed on involuntary unpaid leave (October 5, 2021).  This cause of action seeks a writ for
administrative mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5.  Respondent argues that this cause of action
is untimely under the 90-day statute of limitations period within section
1094.6.  The demurrer is overruled for
several independent reasons.
 
            First, Respondent does not
demonstrate that section 1094.6 applies to this case.  That section sets a 90-day limitations period
for “[j]udicial review of any decision of a local agency, other than [a] school
district . . . .”  (Code Civ. Proc. §
1094.6.)  Respondent is a school
district.  Because Respondent does not
address this issue in the demurrer, it has not demonstrated that it is entitled
to relief.
 
            Second, based upon this record, the
court cannot determine whether the second cause of action is untimely.  Section
1094.6(b) governs when the 90-day statute of begins to run: “If there is a
provision for a written decision or written findings, the decision is final for
purposes of this section upon the date it is mailed by first-class mail,
postage prepaid, including a copy of the affidavit or certificate of mailing,
to the party seeking the writ.”[1]  The Court of Appeal has held that section
1094.6(b) “require[s] that, when the local agency mails its written decision to
the party seeking the writ, such mailing must include a written statement
verified by oath or affirmation, or a written statement attesting to the date
that the decision was mailed to the party by first class mail, postage
prepaid.”  (Donnellan v. City of
Novato (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1097, 1106.) 
Unless this verified statement is included with the mailed decision, the
90-day limitations period does not begin to run.  (Ibid.; see also Rutter, Cal. Prac.
Guide, Administrative Law, ¶¶ 16:234-16:236.) 
The
statute of limitations is a defense upon which Respondent has the burden of
proof.  (See Salton Bay Marina, Inc.
v. Imperial Irrigation Dist. (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 914, 940, fn. 4.)  Accordingly, Respondent has the burden to
prove compliance with the notice provisions of section 1094.6.  Respondent has failed to do so.  
 
            Third, there is equitable tolling of the statute of limitations
under these circumstances.   Petitioner filed a request for a fee waiver on
November 3, 2023, and the court (Beckloff, J.) denied the request without
prejudice.  When a fee waiver is denied,
“the applicant shall pay the court fees and costs that ordinarily would be
charged . . . within 10 days after the clerk gives notice of the denial . . .
.”  (Gov. Code § 68634(g).)  “If the applicant does not pay on time, the
clerk shall void the papers that were filed without payment of the court fees
and costs.”  (Ibid.)  In this case, the clerk did not properly
serve the order because he did not serve Petitioner’s counsel (or even
Petitioner directly).  Instead, he served
the “electronic service provider that submitted the transaction.”  Petitioner’s counsel did not receive notice
of the rejection.  (See Declaration of
Conrad Herring, ¶ 4.)  The case was
voided on November 28, 2023, and that order was served on Petitioner’s
counsel.  (See Clerk’s Notice of Voiding
of Filing, dated November 28, 2023.)  Petitioner’s
counsel attempted to file motions to reinstate the case.  (Declaration of Conrad Herring, ¶ 6.)  Petitioner filed the instant case on December
6, 2023, and received a fee waiver on December 7, 2023.  Because this occurred within 10 days of
notice of the fee rejection, the instant petition would be timely. 
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            Based
upon the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
            1.         Respondent’s demurrer is overruled.
 
            2.         The
court dismisses Respondent Hacienda La Puente Unified School District Personnel
Commission without prejudice and without objection from the parties. 
 
            3.         Respondent
shall file an answer within 30 days.
 
            4.         The
court continues the trial setting conference to May 1, 2024.
 
            5.         Respondent’s
counsel shall provide notice and file proof of service with the court.
