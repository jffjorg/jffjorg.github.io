**Judge's Tentative Ruling**

**Case Number:** 23STCP04550

**Hearing Date:** April 19, 2024

**Department:** 82

**Judge:** Stephen I. Goorvitch

**Order #1:** Motion to Intervene

* The court has no tentative order on this motion.
* The proposed intervenors have not filed a proposed pleading in intervention as required by the statute.

**Order #2:** Tentative Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part Petitioner's Application for Stay

A. Introduction

* Petitioner, The Boeing Company, filed a petition for writ of mandate under California Water Code section 13330 and California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 challenging waste discharge requirements (WDRs) for the Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL) set by the Regional Water Quality Control Board, Los Angeles (Respondent).

B. Waste Discharge Requirements Order No. R4-2023-0359

* The WDRs impose five new monitoring and effluent requirements on Petitioner: (1) New monitoring requirements for PCBs using Method 1668c; (2) New requirements for groundwater infiltration studies at the Silvernale and R-1 Ponds; (3) New monitoring requirements for constituents designated “Chemicals of Potential Concern” in the DTSC’s “Standardized Risk Assessment Methodology” (SRAM) for the SSFL Site; (4) New effluent limits at Discharge Points 001 and 002; and (5) New effluent limits for aluminum.

C. Tentative Ruling

1. Condition One: The court denies Petitioner's request to stay Condition One, which imposes new monitoring requirements for PCBs using Method 1668c. The court finds that staying Condition One would be against the public interest because it would deprive the Regional Board and the public of recently collected data about possible PCB contamination at the Site.

2. Condition Two: The court grants Petitioner's motion to stay Condition Two, which imposes new requirements for groundwater infiltration studies at the Silvernale and R-1 Ponds. The court finds that delaying these studies until after the trial would not compromise the public interest.

3. Condition Three: The court denies Petitioner's request to stay Condition Three, which imposes new monitoring requirements for constituents designated “Chemicals of Potential Concern” in the DTSC’s “Standardized Risk Assessment Methodology” (SRAM) for the SSFL Site. The court finds that staying Condition Three would not be against the public interest.

**PROCEDURAL HISTORY**

* On November 29, 2023, Petitioner filed a petition for review with the State Water Resources Control Board (the “State Board”), seeking review of these new requirements. (Verified First Amended Petition (“FAP”) ¶ 10.)
* Petitioner also filed a request for a stay. (Ibid.)
* Both were deemed dismissed by operation of law on February 19, 2024. (Ibid.)
* Petitioner has exhausted its administrative remedies. (Ibid.)
