```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The Petitioner claims that the EPA representative lacked authority to speak on the issue of proposed Method 1668c for monitoring PCBs. However, the Petitioner does not provide evidence to support this claim. The EPA proposes method 1668c for monitoring PCBs as congeners, which will be used to assess concentrations in the receiving water. The Petitioner suggests that the EPA representative lacked authority, but this claim is unsubstantiated. The judge notes that Section 122.45(h) discusses internal waste streams and provides guidelines for imposing effluent limitations or standards. The judge will review the evidence and make a final ruling.
