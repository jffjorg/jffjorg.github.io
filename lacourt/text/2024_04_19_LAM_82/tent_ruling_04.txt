[1] Petitioner
also relies, in part, on expert evidence that may not be part of the
administrative record.  (See Long Decl.
Exh. 1.)  
 


[2] Specifically, the condition states, in relevant part:
“Monitoring for PCBs as aroclors and PCBs as congeners are required…. PCBs as
congeners shall be individually quantified (or quantified as mixtures of
isomers of a single congener in coelutions as appropriate) using U.S. EPA
proposed method 1668c or using a high-resolution EPA-approved method. U.S. EPA
recommends that until the proposed Method 1668c for PCBs is incorporated into
40 CFR § 136, Dischargers should use for discharge monitoring reports/State
monitoring reports … U.S. EPA proposed method 1668c for monitoring data,
reported as 44 congener results, that will be used for informational purposes
to help assess concentrations in the receiving water.”  (Bower Decl. Exh. A at E.14.)
 


[3] In reply, Petitioner suggests that the EPA
representative lacked authority to speak for the EPA on this issue.  (Reply 9.) 
Petitioner does not cite evidence that supports its position.  


[4] Section 122.45(h), titled
“Internal waste streams”, provides in pertinent part as follows: “(1) When permit effluent
limitations or standards imposed at the point of discharge are impractical or
infeasible, effluent limitations or standards for discharges of pollutants may
be imposed on internal waste streams before mixing with other waste streams or
cooling water streams….  (2) Limits on internal
waste streams will be imposed only when the fact sheet under § 124.56 sets forth the exceptional circumstances
which make such limitations necessary, such as when the final discharge point
is inaccessible … , the wastes at the point of discharge are so diluted as to
make monitoring impracticable, or the interferences among pollutants at the
point of discharge would make detection or analysis impracticable.”
