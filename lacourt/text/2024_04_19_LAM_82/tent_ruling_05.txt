[Tentative] Order Granting Motion for Preliminary
Injunction
 
INTRODUCTION

 
Plaintiff Matthew Abdolmohammadiyon
(“Plaintiff”) filed this action against Fidelity Recovery LLC (“Fidelity” or
“Defendant”), as well as Jack Shut, Oleysa Shut, and Real Property Trustee,
Inc. (“Real Property Trustee”) (collectively, “Defendants”), asserting the
following causes of action:
 
            1.         Wrongful
Foreclosure – Defective Notice of Default 
            2.         Wrongful
Foreclosure – Invalid Deed of Trust 
            3.         Wrongful
Foreclosure – Misrepresentation of Loan 
            4.         Preliminary
Injunction 
            5.         Accounting

            6.         Conversion

 
Plaintiff
owns real property located at 1456 South Bonnie Beach Place, Commerce,
California 90023 (the “Property”), and seek to stop the foreclosure by
Fidelity.  Plaintiff moves for a
preliminary injunction to stop the foreclosure pending the resolution of this
case.  Fidelity opposes the motion, which
is granted in that the court stays the foreclosure pending resolution of this
case.  
 
FACTUAL
BACKGROUND 
 
            Plaintiff
owns the Property and stays there when he visits California.  (See Plaintiff’s Decl. ¶ 3.)  Plaintiff declares that his “business and
personal life required that I lived at the Bonnie Property and alternate with
living in Florida.”  (Declaration of
Plaintiff, ¶ 3.)  However, in a complaint
filed in Florida in December 2023, Plaintiff admitted that he resides in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida. (Declaration of Jack Shut, ¶ 7; Declaration of Gregory
Bodell, ¶ 3 & Exh. 10.)  
 
            For
many years, Plaintiff has borrowed money from Defendant Jack, a pawn shop
owner.  (Declaration of Jack Shut, ¶
4.)  Plaintiff declares that he borrowed
$100,000 at 10% interest from Jack in December 2018.  (Declaration of Plaintiff, ¶ 4.)  Jack declares that he did not loan $100,000
to Plaintiff in December 2018 and that Plaintiff does not owe him any
money.  (Declaration of Jack Shut, ¶ 5.)
 
            Plaintiff
declares that Jack later requested that Plaintiff execute a promissory note,
which Plaintiff did, but the promissory note “contained other terms” not agreed
to by Plaintiff.  (Declaration of
Plaintiff, ¶ 6.)  Plaintiff declares that
“[t]o assuage my concerns, Jack reassured me that our agreement (i.e., $100,000
at 10% interest) was controlling” and that these were just “typographical
errors.”  (Ibid.)
 
On December 12, 2018, Plaintiff
executed a promissory note for $120,000, at 12% interest, in favor of Defendant
Fidelity (the “Promissory Note”).  (Declaration
of Olesya Shut, ¶ 2 & Exh. 1.)   The Promissory
Note states a maturity date of January 1, 2020. 
(Ibid.)  Fidelity’s
manager, Olesya, declares that Plaintiff complained about the interest rate and
monthly payments to Jack.  Olesya
declares that she “spoke with Jack and authorized him, on behalf of Fidelity,
to modify the terms of the loan with Fidelity to 10% interest with monthly
payments of $1,000.”  (Id. ¶
4.)  Plaintiff does not dispute that he
signed the Promissory Note.  (Declaration
of Plaintiff, ¶¶ 5-6.)  
 
On December 17, 2018, Plaintiff signed
a Short Form Deed of Trust and Assignment of Rents (the “Deed of Trust”), which
granted a security interest in the Property to Fidelity.  The Deed of Trust includes an acknowledgement
by notary public Jeffery Gauvin that Plaintiff executed the Deed of Trust on
December 17, 2018, in Gauvin’s presence, in Broward County, Florida.  (Declaration of Olesya Shut, ¶ 3, Exh. 2; Declaration
of Plaintiff, ¶ 7 & Exh. A.) 
Plaintiff acknowledges that he signed the Deed of Trust, but declares
that he “did not sign the Deed of Trust in the presence of Jeffery Gauvin or
any other notary public.”  (Declaration
of Plaintiff, ¶¶ 7-8.)
 
Plaintiff declares that “[i]n about
January 2019 and continuing through October 2023, each month, I deposited
$1,000 into Jack’s TD Ameritrade account pursuant to the terms of the agreement
for the $100,000 hard money loan.”  (Id.
¶ 10.)  Plaintiff submits some of the
deposit slips and checks evidencing his monthly payments to Jack.  (Id. ¶10, Exh. B.) Plaintiff declares
that Jack closed his TD Ameritrade account in November 2023, so that Plaintiff
could not deposit funds.  (Id. ¶
11.)
 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
 
On January 4, 2024, Fidelity, through
its agent Real Property Trustee, caused a Notice of Default and Election to
Sell Under Deed of Trust (the “Notice of Default”) to be sent to
Plaintiff.  The Notice of Default
specified a default of $126,579.99 as of December 27, 2023.  (Declaration of Olesya Shut, ¶ 7 & Exh.
4.)  Plaintiff declares that before the Notice
of Default was issued, he did not receive any other notice of default or other
indication from Defendants that he had missed payments.  (Declaration of Plaintiff, ¶ 12.)
 
            Plaintiff
filed this action on March 6, 2024, and sought a temporary restraining order to
prevent the foreclosure.  The Court
(Beckloff, J.) held a hearing on March 12, 2024, at which Judge Beckloff raised
concerns about the sufficiency of the accounting and itemization of debt on the
Promissory Note that had been provided by Defendants.  (See Mot. Exh. I.)  Judge Beckloff elected to proceed with
Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction, set for hearing on April 19,
2024.  On March 25, 2024, at 3:02 pm,
Fidelity provided a schedule of payments and other loan events on the Promissory
Note.  (Declaration of Olesya Shut, ¶ 9
& Exh. 7; see also Declaration of Gregory Bodell, ¶¶ 2-3 & Exhs. 7,
10.)  
 


 
LEGAL STANDARD  
 
The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the
status quo pending a decision on the merits. 
(Major v. Miraverde Homeowners
Ass’n. (1992) 7 Cal. App. 4th 618, 623.) 
In deciding whether or not to grant a preliminary injunction, the court
looks to two factors, including “(1) the likelihood that the plaintiff will
prevail on the merits, and (2) the relative balance of harms that is likely to
result from the granting or denial of interim injunctive relief.”  (White
v. Davis (2003) 30 Cal.4th 528, 553-54.) The factors are interrelated, with
a greater showing on one permitting a lesser showing on the other.  (Dodge,
Warren & Peters Ins. Services, Inc. v. Riley (2003) 105 Cal.App.4th
1414, 1420.)  However, the party seeking
an injunction must demonstrate at least a reasonable probability of success on
the merits.  (IT Corp. v. County of Imperial (1983) 35 Cal.3d 63, 73-74.)  The party seeking the injunction bears the
burden of demonstrating both a likelihood of success on the merits and the
occurrence of irreparable harm.  (Savage v. Trammell Crow Co. (1990) 223
Cal.App.3d 1562, 1571.) Irreparable harm may exist if the plaintiff can show an
inadequate remedy at law.  (Code Civ.
Proc. § 526(a).) 
 
DISCUSSION 
            
            A.        Likelihood of Success on the Merits 
 
            As
an initial matter, Fidelity argues that Plaintiff has not stated valid causes
of action against Fidelity.  Fidelity
relies on the following holding: “A
preliminary injunction is an interim remedy designed to maintain the
status quo pending a decision on the merits. [Citation.] It is not, in itself,
a cause of action. Thus, a cause of action must exist before injunctive relief
may be granted.”  (Korean American
Legal Advocacy Foundation v. City of Los Angeles (1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 376,
398-399.)  In that case, however, the
trial court had already sustained a demurrer without leave to amend, leaving no
predicate causes of action.  Here,
Fidelity never filed a demurrer, notwithstanding having had an opportunity to
do so.  Nevertheless, the court will
consider the relevant issues in evaluating Plaintiff’s reasonable likelihood of
success on each claim.
 
                        1.         First Cause of Action  
 
            In the
first cause of action, Plaintiff alleges: “[I]n violation of Civil Code §
2924.17, the Notice of Default and Beneficiary Declaration are not supported by
competent and reliable evidence because PROPERTY TRUSTEE failed to attach a
promissory note to the Notice of Default or Deed of Trust and failed to an
itemization of debt after numerous requests.” 
(Compl. ¶ 43; see also Motion for Preliminary Injunction (“Mot.”) 13.)  Section 2924.17 states, in pertinent part, as
follows:
 
(a)
A declaration recorded pursuant to Section 2923.5 or pursuant to Section 2923.55, a notice of default … or a declaration
or affidavit filed in any court relative to a foreclosure proceeding shall be
accurate and complete and supported by competent and reliable evidence.
 
(b)
Before recording or filing any of the documents described in subdivision (a), a
mortgage servicer shall ensure that it has reviewed competent and reliable
evidence to substantiate the borrower's default and the right to foreclose,
including the borrower's loan status and loan information.
 
Sections
2924.12 and 2924.19 state, in pertinent part, that “if a trustee’s deed upon
sale has not been recorded, a borrower may bring an action for injunctive
relief to enjoin a material violation of … 2924.17.” 
(§ 2924.12(a); § 2924.19(a).)  
 
            These
statutes are part of California’s Homeowner Bill of Rights (“HBOR”).  “[T]he HBOR [is] a complex set of enactments
focused specifically on residential mortgages ….” (Morris v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2022) 78 Cal.App.5th 279, 295 [bold italics
added].) Thus, section 2924.15(a) states in pertinent part as follows:
 
(a)
Unless otherwise provided, paragraph (5) of subdivision (a) of Section 2924 and Sections 2923.5, 2923.55, 2923.6, 2923.7, 2924.9, 2924.10, 2924.11, and 2924.18 shall apply only to a first lien
mortgage or deed of trust that meets either of the following conditions:
 
(1)(A)
The first lien mortgage or deed of trust is secured by owner-occupied
residential real property containing no more than four dwelling units.
 
(B)
For purposes of this paragraph, “owner-occupied” means that the
property is the principal residence of the borrower and is security for a loan
made for personal, family, or household purposes.
 
In the instant case, Plaintiff alleges
that the Notice of Default was defective, and he seeks to enforce sections
2923.5 and/or 2923.55, which apply to notices of default.  However, Plaintiff has not shown a likelihood
that his mortgage is “residential” within the meaning of section 2924.15, i.e.,
that it is Plaintiff’s “principal residence.” 
To the contrary.  Although
Plaintiff claims that he
“live[s] at the Bonnie Property,” he also acknowledges that his “business and
personal life required that I lived at the Bonnie Property and alternate with
living in Florida.”  (See Declaration of
Plaintiff, ¶ 3.)  In a complaint filed in
Florida in December 2023, Plaintiff admitted that he resides in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida. (Declaration of Jack Shut, ¶ 7; Declaration of Gregory Bodell,
¶ 3 & Exh. 10.)  Plaintiff does not
address these issues in his reply brief. 

 
Nor does Plaintiff establish that the
loan was “made for personal, family, or household purposes.”  Plaintiff admits that the purported first
loan for $100,000 was a “hard money loan.” 
(See, e.g., Compl., ¶ 12.)  The
promissory note for the $120,000 loan states that it was a “business
loan.”  (See Declaration of Olesya Shut,
Exh. 1.)    
 
Plaintiff does not response to
Defendant’s argument that the Notice of Default contained the declaration required
by section 2924.17.  (Oppo. 16; Sehulster Tunnels/Pre-Con v. Traylor
Brothers, Inc. (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1328, 1345, fn. 16 [failure to
address point is “equivalent to a concession”].)[1]  In
Lucioni v. Bank of America, N.A. (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 150, discussed at
length by Defendant, the Court of Appeal summarized the legal duty created by
section 2924.17, as follows: “Sections 2924.17 and 2923.55, then, place a
burden on the foreclosing party to file a declaration with the notice of
default, and provide requirements for the lender’s diligence prior to filing
that declaration. Those provisions do not create a burden on the foreclosing
party to prove anything in court, other than that the declaration required by
section 2923.55, subdivision (c) was filed, and that necessary steps were taken
before filing it.”  (Id. at 163.)
 
            In
the instant case, the Notice of Default contained the required declaration by
the trustee that the “mortgage service/lender has supplied reliable and
competent evidence to substantiate the borrower’s default and its right to
foreclose.”  (Declaration of Olesya Shut,
¶ 7; Exh. 4, p. 6; Exh. 6, p. 6.) 
Contrary to Plaintiff’s assertion, section 2924.17 does not require
Defendants to produce an “itemization of debt.” 
(Compl. ¶ 43.)
 
            Based
upon the foregoing, Plaintiff has not demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of
success on the merits of the first cause of action.
 

                        2.         Second Cause of Action 
            
            In the second cause of action,
Plaintiff alleges that the Deed of Trust “is facially invalid as the notary
public’s signature does not attest to a witness being present” and that
“Plaintiff did not sign the Deed of Trust in the presence of a notary
public.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 51-52.)  Significantly, Plaintiff
acknowledges that he signed the Deed of Trust. 
(Declaration of Plaintiff, ¶¶ 7-8.) 
In his briefing, Plaintiff does not demonstrate that notarization is
required for the Deed of Trust to be valid. 
Plaintiff relies on Civil Code section 2922 and section 2920, but
neither of those statutes require notarization. 
(See Mot. 14.)  Fidelity argues:
“The purpose of an acknowledgment to a mortgage on real estate is merely to
obviate proof of its execution when it is offered in evidence and to entitle it
to be recorded, but the mortgage itself is valid between the parties ….”  (Williams v. Nieto (1929) 98 Cal.App.
615, 619; see Oppo. 17.)  Simply, the
purpose of a notarization is to prove that Plaintiff executed the Deed of
Trust.  Plaintiff admits that he signed
the document.   
 
            Further, Defendant presents evidence
that undermines Plaintiff’s allegation that the Deed of Trust does not identify
any person who appeared before the notary, Jeffrey Gauvin, at the time of
notarization.  Specifically, Defendant
submits a complete copy of the Deed of Trust, which was recorded and states on
page three that Plaintiff appeared before Gauvin on December 17, 2018, to sign
the Deed of Trust.  (Declaration of Olesya
Shut, ¶ 3 & Exh. 2.)  In reply,
Plaintiff declares that he has been unable to locate Gauvin, more than five
years later, but he does not present evidence that would raise a serious
question about the authenticity of the Deed of Trust offered by Defendant.  (See Declaration of Plaintiff in Support of
Reply Brief.)  
 
            Based upon this record, Plaintiff
cannot demonstrate a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of the
second cause of action.  
 
                        3.         Third Cause of Action 
 
            In the third cause of action—titled
“Wrongful Foreclosure Misrepresentation of Loan—Plaintiff alleges that he only
agreed to a $100,000 loan at 10% interest with Defendant Jack, not the $120,000
loan at 12% interest reflected in the Promissory Note.  Plaintiff also alleges that “Defendants have
not provided Plaintiff with any credit for the nearly $60,000 that Plaintiff
has paid and have not even acknowledged Plaintiff’s monthly payments.”  Plaintiff further alleges that Defendants
“are pursuing the foreclosure, not because it is proper, but because they
intend to defraud, oppress, and substantially interfere with Plaintiff’s
livelihood.”  (Compl. ¶¶ 62-67.)
 
            Plaintiff cites no statutory
authority for this cause of action in the complaint.  In the motion, Plaintiff suggests that the
third cause of action was based on alleged violations of Civil Code section
2824.17 and an alleged failure to base the foreclosure on “competent and
reliable evidence to support a foreclosure.” 
(Mot. 14-15.)  Plaintiff argues:
 
            Property
Trustee waited until February 8, 2024, to send Plaintiff’s counsel the
requested Promissory Note.  Instead of an
itemization of the alleged debt owed, Property Trustee sent a Payoff Statement.  Unfortunately, neither the Notice of
Default nor the Payoff Statement applies the nearly $60,000 Plaintiff has paid
towards the underlying loan (assuming the loan, as represented in the
Promissory Note, is accurate). Absent an itemization or credits of the monies
paid, Plaintiff cannot verify the actual debt owed, if any, or if/when
Plaintiff breached his obligation. The Schedule provided on the day of filing
this motion continues to highlight the woefully insufficient accounting.
 
(Mot. 15:1-5.)  However, as
discussed, Plaintiff does not demonstrate a reasonable likelihood of success on
the merits of claims under section 2924.17. 
Plaintiff makes additional arguments, but they appear relevant to the
court’s analysis of the sixth cause of action.
 
                        4.         Fourth and Fifth Causes of Action  
 
            Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action is
for “preliminary injunction.” 
Plaintiff’s fifth cause of action is for “accounting.”  These claims, which are remedial in nature,
cannot support a request for a preliminary injunction.  
 
                        5.         Sixth Cause of Action 
 
            Plaintiff’s sixth cause of action is
for conversion.  The elements of
conversion are as follows: (1) The plaintiff’s ownership or right to possession
of the property; (2) The defendant’s conversion by a wrongful act or
disposition of property rights; and (3) Damages.  (See Welco Electronics, Inc. v. Mora
(2013) 223 Cal.App.4th 202, 208.)
 
            Plaintiff alleges that he agreed to borrow $100,000 at an interest rate
of 10% from Jack Shut, and he made $60,000 in payments towards that loan.  (Compl., ¶¶ 21, 102-103.)  Plaintiff alleges: “On January 4, 2024,
Property Trustee recorded the Notice of Default on the Bonnie Property under
the contention that Plaintiff has not made a single payment under the
promissory note since 2019.”  (Id.,
¶ 103.)  Plaintiff’s theory is that
Defendants manufactured the default in order to foreclose on the Subject
Property.  (Id., ¶¶ 106-107.)  Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief to stop the
foreclosure.  (Id., ¶ 93 & Prayer, ¶
6.)         
 
            Jack Shut disputes that he made this
purported loan to Plaintiff.  “Plaintiff’s
statement that I loaned him $100,000 in December 2018 at 10% interest, with no
maturity date is false.  Plaintiff does
not owe me any money.”  (Declaration of
Jack Shut, ¶ 5.)  Instead, Defendants allege
that there was one loan between Plaintiff and Fidelity in the amount of $120,000,
which forms the basis of the foreclosure action.  (Declaration of Oleysa Shut, Exh. 1; see also
Declaration of Plaintiff, Exh. E.)  There
is a “Promissory Note Secured By Deed of Trust” in the amount of $120,000
signed by Plaintiff.  (See Declaration of
Amy A. Mousavi, Exh. E.)  Plaintiff admits
he signed the Promissory Note and includes a copy with his moving papers.  (See Declaration of Plaintiff, ¶ 5.)  There is a “Short Form Deed of Trust and
Assignment of Rents” reflecting the Promissory Note in the “principal sum of
$120,000” signed by Plaintiff.  (See id.,
Exh. A.)  Plaintiff admits that he signed
this Deed of Trust.  (See id., ¶
7.)  According to Plaintiff, Jack Shut
asked him to sign this document as a “formality” to memorialize the terms of
the purported loan.  (See id., ¶ 9.)  According to Plaintiff, the Promissory Note
“did not reflect the agreement,” but Jack Shut claimed these were just
“typographical errors.”  (Id., ¶
6.) 
 
            However, there are discrepancies in
the documentation.  The Promissory Note
reflects an interest rate of 12 percent. 
(See Declaration of Amy E. Mousavi, Exh. E.)  According to Jack and Oleysa Shut, the
interest rate was reduced to 10 percent at Plaintiff’s request, i.e., the
interest was $1,000 per month.  (See
Declaration of Jack Shut, ¶ 6; Declaration of Oleysa Shut, ¶ 4.)  This purported change in the interest rate
was not done in writing.  
 
            Perhaps most important, Defendants
provide no evidence that Fidelity actually transferred $120,000 to Plaintiff.  The only evidence of a money transfer to
Plaintiff comes from Plaintiff himself. 
Plaintiff represents that Exhibit AA to his declaration “is a screenshot
of [his] text message with Jack [Shut] showing the balance of $100,000 to be
transferred.”  (Declaration of Plaintiff,
¶ 4.)  The screen shots appear to show
$100,000 being transferred.  (See id.,
Exh. AA.)  While this text message is not
the model of clarity, Defendants do not explain or dispute the text message.  This failure is telling, given the ease with
which Defendants could have provided evidence of a transfer of $120,000, as
well as Judge Beckloff’s prior admonitions on the importance of an accounting
and supporting documentation.  (See
Declaration of Jesus Hinojosa, Exh. I.)
 
            Defendants argue that even if
Plaintiff borrowed only $100,000 at an interest rate of 10 percent, he still
owes money.  That may be true, but that
would mean that the Notice of Default and accounting are incorrect and therefore
would not support the foreclosure.
 
            Based upon the foregoing, the court
finds that Plaintiff has demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on the
merits.  
 
            B.        Balancing
of the Harms 
 
The
court also must consider “the interim harm that the plaintiff would be likely
to sustain if the injunction were denied as compared to the harm the defendant
would be likely to suffer if the preliminary injunction were issued.”  (Smith
v. Adventist Health System/West (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 729, 749.)  “Irreparable harm” generally means that the
defendant’s act constitutes an actual or threatened injury to the personal or
property rights of the plaintiff that cannot be compensated by a damages
award.  (See Brownfield v. Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital (1989) 208 Cal.App.3d
405, 410.)  
 
Real
property is generally considered “unique” so that injury cannot be compensated
in damages.  (See Civ. Code § 3387.)  An injury to a plaintiff’s rights to
real property often will be irreparable. 
(See Donahue Schriber Realty Group, Inc. v. Nu Creation Outreach (2014)
232 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1184-85; Christopher v. Jones (1964) 231
Cal.App.2d 408, 416; Civ. Code § 3387.)  Plaintiff also relies on evidence that he
stays at the Property when he visits California.  (See Declaration of Plaintiff, ¶ 3.)      
 
Olesya declares that “[n]o date of sale
for the Bonnie Property has been set and it has not been sold.”  (Olesya Decl. ¶ 8.)  Nevertheless, it appears that Defendants
intend to foreclose on this property, which may occur before trial in this
matter.  (See Olesya Decl. ¶ 7 and Exhs.
4, 5.)  Defendants’ counsel argues that
Plaintiff has “falsely alleged” in his complaint that he resides in California
and has also “testified falsely” that he currently lives in the Property.  (Oppo. 10-11.)    Although the argument is not fully developed,
Defendants’ counsel suggests that Plaintiff’s alleged lack of candor is an
equitable factor that the court should consider in balancing the harms and deciding
whether to grant equitable relief. 
However, Plaintiff did not represent that he lives exclusively or
primarily at the Property.  Rather,
Plaintiff represented that he lives in both California and Florida, and he
resides at the Property when he is in California.  This record does not support an adverse
credibility finding.  Even the pleading
identified by Defendants does not state that Plaintiff relies exclusively in
Florida.  (See Declaration of Gregory Bodell,
Exh. #10.)  The court will not make an
adverse credibility finding based upon this record.  
 
Notably, Defendant has not shown any
irreparable harm from the grant of a preliminary injunction.  Defendant states that it “likely will lose
the principal it loaned to Plaintiff in 2018 if an injunction is granted.”  (Oppo. 19.) 
There is no evidence to support that contention.  Indeed, Fidelity still has a lien against the
Property.  If Defendants prevail at
trial, they will be able to proceed with the foreclosure—potentially recovering
additional interest—and recoup their losses. 
 
 
The
balance of harms weighs in favor of granting the preliminary injunction. 
 
            C.        Undertaking

 
A
preliminary injunction ordinarily cannot take effect unless and until the
plaintiff provides an undertaking for damages which the enjoined defendant may
sustain by reason of the injunction if the court finally decides that the
plaintiff was not entitled to the injunction. 
(See CCP § 529(a); City of South San Francisco v. Cypress Lawn Cemetery Ass’n. (1992)
11 Cal. App. 4th 916, 920; see Abba
Rubber Co. v. Seaquist (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1, 15-16 [“the prevailing
defendant may recover that portion of his attorney's fees attributable to
defending against those causes of action on which the issuance of the
preliminary injunction had been based”].)  

 
Neither
party addresses the appropriate amount of undertaking.  Defendants will likely incur attorney’s fees
litigating the causes of action on which a preliminary injunction would be
based.  The court finds that an
undertaking of $100,000 is required should the court grant the motion.  
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            Based
upon the foregoing, the court orders as follows:
 
            1.         Plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary
injunction is granted in part and denied in part.  
 
            2.         Pending resolution of this case,
Defendants are restrained and enjoined from foreclosing on the real property
located at 1456 South Bonnie Beach Place, Commerce, California 90023.
 
            3.         The court denies the motion to the
extent Plaintiff seek to “enjoin[] and restrain[] [Defendants] from withholding
itemization of debt associated with the foreclosure.”  This issue should be resolved in discovery.
 
            4.         The court denies the motion to the
extent Plaintiff seeks an order that “Defendants must provide a valid Deed of
Trust authorizing a non-judicial foreclosure.” 
This issue should be resolved in discovery.
 
            5.         The court orders Plaintiff to post an
undertaking of $100,000 on or before ________, 2024.  If Plaintiff does not post the required
undertaking, Defendants may ask the home court to dissolve this preliminary
injunction.
 
            6.         Plaintiff’s counsel shall provide
notice and file proof of service with the court.  
 
 
IT
IS SO ORDERED.
