  Case Number:  20STCV27099    Hearing Date:   October 16, 2024    Dept:  29 Wantuch v. Walmart
20STCV27099
Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment 
TENTATIVE
The motion is granted. 
Background
On July 20, 2020, Stephanie E.
Wantuch (“Plaintiff”) filed a complaint against Walmart, Inc. (“Defendant”) and
Does 1 through 50 for negligence arising out of a slip and fall occurring on
September 25, 2018.
Walmart filed an answer on May
10, 2021, and an amended answer on May 19, 2021.
On December 16, 2022, Plaintiff’s counsel was
relieved as counsel. Plaintiff has been representing herself, in pro per, since
that time.
Plaintiff failed to respond to discovery
propounded by Defendant. On May 15, 2024, the Court granted Defendant’s motion
to deem Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in Requests
for Admission (Set Three). 
On June 20, 2024, Plaintiff filed with the Court
what appear to be verified responses to the Requests for Admission. Plaintiff did
not, however, file a motion to withdraw or amend an admission under Code of
Civil Procedure section 2033.300. Plaintiff also did not include a proof of
service in the filing; it is unclear whether the responses were served on
Defendant.  (See Colbert Decl., ¶ 11
[stating that as of July 29, 2024, Plaintiff had not provided responses to the Requests
for Admission].)
Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on
July 17, 2024, withdrew it, and then filed this motion on July 29, 2024.
No opposition has been filed.
Legal
Standard
“The purpose
of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations,
trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section
437c, subdivision (c), “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if
all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the
evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there
is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion
for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the
affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of
fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of
Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v.
Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381-382.)
As to each cause
of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary judgment
or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting
facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ... cannot be
established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25
Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)
A plaintiff or
cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that there is
no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has
met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show
that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of
action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
The party opposing
a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not simply “rely upon
the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set forth the
specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.” (Code Civ.
Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable issue of
material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)
Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the
party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in
favor of that party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th
384, 389.)
Discussion
Plaintiff
asserts a negligence cause of action against Defendant.
The basic elements of a
cause of action for negligence are: (1) the existence of a legal duty; (2)
breach of that duty; (3) causation; and (4) resulting damages. (Brown
v. USA Taekwondo (2021) 11 Cal.5th 204, 213; Romero v. Los Angeles Rams
(2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 562, 567.)
On May 15,
2024, the Court issued an order deeming Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of
the matters specified in Defendant’s Requests for Admission (Set Three). The
following (among others) were deemed admitted as to Plaintiff: 
“(86.)  Admit that YOU did not sustain any damages
from the INCIDENT. 
(87.)  Admit that Walmart did not owe YOU a duty of
care at the time of the INCIDENT. 
(88.)  Admit that Walmart did not breach any duty of
care to YOU at the time of the INCIDENT.”
(Exh.
B.)
“[A]
deemed admitted order establishes, by judicial fiat, that a nonresponding party
has responded to the requests by admitting the truth of all matters contained
therein.” (Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 979.) If a party
does not move the trial court to allow for withdrawal or amendment of an
admission, the admission is conclusively established against that party in the
action. (See Joyce v. Ford Motor Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1478, 1489.)

With this evidence, Defendant has met its burden on
summary judgment of presenting evidence to show “that one or more elements of
the cause of action ... cannot be established.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd.
(p)(2).) 
The burden then shifts to Plaintiff to show that a
“triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of action.”
(Ibid.) Plaintiff has not filed any opposition to the motion or
otherwise met her burden. 
Accordingly,
Defendant’s motion is granted. Defendant has shown that one or more elements of
Plaintiff’s cause of action cannot be established and that it is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS Defendant Walmart Inc.’s motion for
summary judgment.
Moving
Party is to provide notice.
