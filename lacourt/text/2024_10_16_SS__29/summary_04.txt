Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants in part and denies in part Defendant Fernandes' motion to continue the trial date from October 14, 2024 to April 2025. The court finds good cause to grant a continuance to January 9, 2025, as Defendant showed that it would not have been reasonable to work up the case for trial during the time period when there was an apparent agreement between the parties for Plaintiff to dismiss the case in exchange for a waiver of costs. However, the court denies a continuance to April 2025, as the remaining discovery can be completed much sooner than that and Defendant's lead trial counsel's unavailability for certain periods due to holidays and vacation is not a sufficient reason to delay the trial.
