English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling granting Defendant Walmart, Inc.'s motion for summary judgment in a negligence case filed by Plaintiff Stephanie E. Wantuch. The case stems from a slip and fall incident that occurred on September 25, 2018, for which Plaintiff alleges negligence on the part of Defendant. However, Plaintiff failed to respond to discovery propounded by Defendant and did not file an opposition to the motion for summary judgment. As a result, the Court has deemed Plaintiff to have admitted the truth of the matters specified in Defendant's Requests for Admission (Set Three). The Court has concluded that Defendant has met its burden of showing that one or more elements of Plaintiff's cause of action cannot be established and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
