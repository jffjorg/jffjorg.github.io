And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge's tentative ruling is that the motion to substitute Storm King Chauvin, a minor, as the successor-in-interest of the plaintiff, Storm Chauvin, is continued. This is because the plaintiff died on March 11, 2024, and under California Code of Civil Procedure section 377.31, the decedent's personal representative or successor-in-interest may continue a decedent's pending action. The motion is supported by a declaration filed by Kiara Colato, who is the mother of Storm King Chauvin, which provides the necessary information required under Code of Civil Procedure section 377.32. However, the Judge notes that a minor child must have a guardian ad litem appointed to participate in civil litigation, and Ms. Colato has not filed an application for this purpose. Therefore, the motion is continued for approximately 30 days to allow Ms. Colato to file for and obtain a court order appointing her as Storm King Chauvin's Guardian Ad Litem.
