BACKGROUND
 
On March 13, 2023, Plaintiffs Rodolfo
Garcia-Rosas and Alma Delia Llamas filed the operative first amended complaint
against Defendants Architectural Surfaces, Inc., et al., asserting causes of
action for (1) negligence; (2) strict liability – warning defect; (3) strict
liability – design defect; (4) fraudulent concealment; (5) breach of implied
warranties; and (6) loss of consortium. Plaintiff alleges he developed
silicosis and consequential injuries through his employment working with stone
products manufactured, distributed, and/or supplied by Defendants.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“The purpose of the law of summary judgment
is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties' pleadings in
order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in fact
necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Trial judges are required “to grant summary
judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)
 
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to
establish a defense. (CCP § 437c(p)(2).) Once the defendant has met that
burden, “the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one
or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.”
(Id.)  To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce “substantial
responsive evidence.” (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing
summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that
party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384,
389.)
 
Defendant EIDP moves for summary
judgment on the ground that there is no evidence showing Plaintiff’s silicosis
was caused by Defendant’s stone products. Defendant presents evidence showing
that Plaintiff did not remember working with any stone slabs supplied Defendant
and that Defendant did not supply any products to Plaintiff’s employers.
Plaintiff does not oppose this motion to show otherwise.
 
Defendant has met its burden to
establish that no triable issues of fact exist, and Defendant is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is
GRANTED.

BACKGROUND
 
On March 13, 2023, Plaintiffs Rodolfo
Garcia-Rosas and Alma Delia Llamas filed the operative first amended complaint
against Defendants Architectural Surfaces, Inc., et al., asserting causes of
action for (1) negligence; (2) strict liability – warning defect; (3) strict

silicosis and consequential injuries through his employment working with stone
products manufactured, distributed, and/or supplied by Defendants.
 
EVIDENCE
OBJECTIONS
“In granting or denying a motion for
summary judgment or summary adjudication, the court need rule only on those
objections to evidence that it deems material to its disposition of the
motion.” (CCP § 437c(q).) Defendant’s objections to the declaration of Dr. Kenneth Rosenman are
OVERRULED.
 
ANALYSIS
 
“The purpose of the law of summary
judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties'
pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in
fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Trial judges are required “to grant summary
judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)
 
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to
establish a defense. (CCP § 437c(p)(2).) Once the defendant has met that
burden, “the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one
or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.”
(Id.)  To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce “substantial
responsive evidence.” (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing
summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that
party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
 
A. Statute of Limitations
 
Defendant asserts that Plaintiff’s
claims are barred by the two-year statute of limitations for personal injury
claims. (CCP §335.1.) Defendant presents evidence showing
Plaintiff first sought treatment for pulmonary symptoms in 2019, requiring
Plaintiff to file suit no later than 2021. Plaintiff filed this action in 2022.
In opposition, Plaintiff presents evidence showing Plaintiff did not receive a
silicosis diagnosis until March 2022. This is sufficient to create a triable
issue of fact as to the statute of limitations. The motion cannot be granted on
this ground.
 
B. Negligence
 
Defendant argues that the claim for
negligence fails because Defendant complied with the Hazard Communication
Standards, Plaintiff did not use quartz distributed by Defendant, and
Plaintiff’s employers were sophisticated intermediaries.
 
1.    Hazard Communication Standard
 
Under 29 Code of Federal Regulations
§1910.1200(a)(2), the standard set forth therein is “intended to address
comprehensively the issue of classifying the potential hazards of chemicals,
and communicating information concerning hazards and appropriate protective
measures to employees, and to preempt any legislative or regulatory enactments
of a state, or political subdivision of a state, pertaining to this
subject.”  (29 C.F.R. §1910.1200(a)(2).)  “This section requires chemical manufacturers
or importers to classify the hazards of chemicals which they produce or import,
and all employers to provide information to their employees about the hazardous
chemicals to which they are exposed, by means of a hazard communication
program, labels and other forms of warning, safety data sheets, and information
and training. In addition, this section requires distributors to transmit the
required information to employers.”  (29
C.F.R. §1910.1200(b)(1).)  
 
However, nothing in Title 29, Chapter
15 of the United States Annotated Code (“Occupational Safety and Health”)
“shall be construed to superseded or in any manner affect any  workmen's compensation law or to enlarge or
diminish or affect in any other manner the common law or statutory rights,
duties, or liabilities of employers and employees under any law with respect to
injuries, diseases, or death of employees arising out of, or in the course of,
employment.”  (29 U.S.C.A. §653(4).)  
 
Defendant argues that 29 C.F.R.
§1910.1200 bars Plaintiff’s claims because Defendant complied with the statute
and because it makes employers responsible for protecting their workforce from
occupational exposures to respirable chemicals. 
Defendant argues Plaintiff’s employers never provided him with any
information, documents, or warnings issued by the stone countertop
manufacturers and they are therefore liable for Plaintiff’s injuries.
 
Defendant’s argument and evidence, at
best, establish Plaintiff’s employer’s statutory duty under the Hazard
Communications Standard to provide warnings and protection against the dangers
of exposure to the products in question. 
They do not bar Plaintiff’s claims against Defendant.  Defendant cites no authority holding that the
Hazard Communications Standard makes employers solely responsible or liable for
employee injuries due to chemical exposure. The motion cannot be granted on
this ground.
 
2.    Causation
 
Defendant also asserts that Plaintiff
did not work with any stone slabs provided by Defendant. Defendant presents
evidence showing it did not sell Plaintiff’s employer any Sequel or Revera Quartz during the relevant period and evidence showing
Plaintiff did not remember working with these products. In opposition,
Plaintiff points to his deposition testimony about seeing Defendant’s truck
drop off slabs of stone at Bradeskoval, and to Defendant’s admission that it
supplied approximately 25 slabs of artificial stone as “samples.” Plaintiff’s
recollection of seeing the Bedrosians truck, combined with Defendant admission
to supplying artificial stone to Bradeskoval, raises a reasonable inference
that Paragon supplied such artificial stone to Plaintiff’s worksite and that Plaintiff
worked with, or around, such product. The motion cannot be granted on this
basis.
 
3.   
Sophisticated
Intermediary Defense
 
Under the sophisticated intermediary
doctrine, “a supplier may discharge its duty to warn end users about known or
knowable risks in the use of its product if it: (1) provides adequate warnings
to the product's immediate purchaser, or sells to a sophisticated purchaser
that it knows is aware or should be aware of the specific danger, and (2)
reasonably relies on the purchaser to convey appropriate warnings to downstream
users who will encounter the product. Because the sophisticated intermediary
doctrine is an affirmative defense, the supplier bears the burden of proving
that it adequately warned the intermediary, or knew the intermediary was aware
or should have been aware of the specific hazard, and reasonably relied on the
intermediary to transmit warnings.”  (Webb
v. Special Electric Co., Inc. (2016) 63 Cal.4th 167, 187.)  
 
“Like the sophisticated user defense,
the sophisticated intermediary defense applies to failure to warn claims
sounding in either strict liability or negligence.  As we have previously observed, there is
little functional difference between the two theories in the failure to warn
context.  In failure to warn cases,
whether asserted on negligence or strict liability grounds, there is but one
unitary theory of liability which is negligence based—the duty to use
reasonable care in promulgating a warning.” 
(Id.)  
 
“[T]he sophisticated intermediary
doctrine provides that a supplier can discharge its duty to warn if it provides
adequate warnings, or sells to a sufficiently sophisticated buyer, and
reasonably relies on the buyer to warn end users about the harm. Reasonable
reliance depends on all attendant circumstances and is typically a question of
fact for the jury.”  (Webb, supra,
63 Cal.4th 167, 180; see also 6 Witkin, Summary (11th
ed. 2024), Torts § 1322.) 
 
Defendant represents that it provided
the legally required warnings to Plaintiff’s
employer, Bradeskoval, who is an experienced owner and operator of stone
fabrication shops throughout Southern California.  In opposition,
Plaintiff disputes that Defendant provided adequate warnings to Plaintiff’s
employers. Plaintiff asserts that Defendant has not provided evidence showing
it provided any warnings and/or safety data sheets or any hazard or
safety information to his workplaces. This is sufficient to create a triable
issue of fact as to the sophisticated intermediary defense. The motion cannot
be granted on this basis.
 
Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is DENIED. The motion for
summary adjudication of the claim for negligence is DENIED.
 
C. Strict Liability 
 
Defendant asserts the claims for strict
liability for fail for the same reasons as the claim for negligence. As discussed,
Plaintiff has established a triable issue of fact as to negligence. 
 
The motion for summary adjudication of
the claims for strict liability is DENIED.
 
D. Fraudulent Concealment
 
The elements of fraud are: “(a)
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b)
knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce
reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Charnay v.
Cobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 184.) California law recognizes four
circumstances in which a nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable
fraud: “(1) when the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the
plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not
known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively conceals a material
fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the defendant makes partial
representations but also suppresses some material facts.”  (Heliotis v. Schuman (1986) 181 Cal.
App. 3d 646, 651.)  
 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot
establish a claim for fraudulent concealment because Defendant’s Material Safety Data Sheets were publicly available through its website.
Additionally, citing Bigler-Engler
v. Breg, Inc. (2017) 7 Cal.App.5th 276, 310-311 and LiMandri
v. Judkins (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 326, 336-337, Defendant argues
it was not in a fiduciary relationship with Plaintiff nor did they have a
transactional relationship involving “direct dealings,” such as “seller and
buyer, employer and prospective employee, doctor and patient, or contractual
arrangement.” 
 
The Court disagrees that fraudulent
concealment is barred as a matter of law on this ground.  In Jones v. ConocoPhillips Co. (2011)
198 Cal.App.4th 1187, plaintiffs alleged a duty of disclosure based on (1)
defendant Dow’s awareness of the toxic nature of their products, (2) Dow’s sole
knowledge of that fact; and (3) decedent who worked with the product did not
have that knowledge available to him.  (Jones,
supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at 1199.)  The
decedent in Jones, like Plaintiff, was an employee of employers who
purchased and used chemicals from various manufacturers and suffered various
health issues because of exposure to those chemicals.  (Id. at 1198.)  “Although, typically, a duty to disclose
arises when a defendant owes a fiduciary duty to a plaintiff, a duty to
disclose may also arise when a defendant possesses or exerts control over
material facts not readily available to the plaintiff.”  (Id.)
 
The analysis in Jones was based
on LiMandri, which stated that, outside of a fiduciary relationship, a
duty to disclose can arise in three other circumstances:  when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of
material facts not known to the plaintiff; when the defendant actively conceals
a material fact from the plaintiff; and when the defendant makes partial
representations but also suppresses some material facts.  (LiMandri, supra, 52
Cal.App.4th at 336-337.)  “These three
circumstances, however, presuppose the existence of some other relationship
between the plaintiff and defendant in which a duty to disclose can arise.”  (Id.) 
Because Jones relied explicitly on this discussion in LiMandri,
Jones is reasonably interpreted to imply that “some other relationship,”
such as a transactional relationship, exists between an employee who uses a
hazardous chemical purchased by his or her employer and the manufacturer or
distributor from whom the employer purchased that product.  (LiMandri, supra, 52
Cal.App.4th at 337.)
 
Such an interpretation is supported by Peterson
v. Lamb Rubber Co. (1960) 54 Cal.2d 339, 347.  Peterson held that an employee is in
contractual privity with a manufacturer for purposes of a breach of implied
warranty claim:  “[I]t is a matter of
common knowledge, and of course known to vendor-manufacturers, that most businesses
are carried on by means of the assistance of employees and that equipment or
supplies purchased by employers will in actual use be handled by the employes,
who in this respect may be said to stand in the shoes of the employer.”  (Peterson, supra, 54 Cal.2d at
347.)  By this reasoning, an employee of
a company that purchases a toxic chemical for use in the employer’s business is
in a “transactional relationship” with the manufacturer of that chemical and a
duty to disclose exists.  
 
Bigler-Engler does not change this analysis.  Bigler-Engler merely reiterated LiMandri’s
statement that “some other relationship” must exist to find a duty of
disclosure where there is no fiduciary relationship.  Bilger-Engler held that such a
relationship must be the result of some transaction.  (Bigler-Engler, supra, 7 Cal.App.5th
at 312.)  “Such a transaction must
necessarily arise from direct dealings between the plaintiff and the defendant;
it cannot arise between the defendant and the public at large.”  Id. 
The Court reversed a jury verdict on the plaintiff’s intentional
concealment claim on grounds that the record did not support a finding of a
duty of disclosure.  (Id. at 315.)
 
Bigler-Engler is also factually
distinguishable.  The plaintiff in Bigler-Engler
was a patient who was injured by a medical device prescribed by her
physician.  The plaintiff also sued the
manufacturer of the medical device on several theories, including fraudulent
concealment.  The Court found that there
were no “direct dealings” between plaintiff and the manufacturer to support a
duty of disclosure.  Plaintiff is suing
the manufacturers who sold stone product to his employers or hirers. Plaintiff
came in contact with product as an employee or hired contractor of his
employers or hirers, who purportedly had direct dealings with the
manufacturers.  Plaintiff came into
contact with the chemicals as an agent of his employers.  Plaintiff was not a “member of the public at
large.”  Bigler-Engler did not
examine whether the specific relationship at issue here satisfies the “some
other relationship” or “direct dealing” (manufacturer/seller to employer/buyer
to employee/agent) requirement to impose a duty of disclosure on a defendant
who is not a fiduciary.  Jones did
examine this exact type of relationship and found it gave rise to a duty of
disclosure sufficient to support a fraudulent concealment cause of action.  
 
The motion for summary adjudication of
the claim for fraud is DENIED.
 
E. Breach of Implied Warranty and Loss
of Consortium
 
Defendant asserts the claims for breach
of warranty and loss of consortium fail because Plaintiff did not work with
stone supplied by Defendant. As stated, Plaintiff has established a triable
issue of fact as to whether Plaintiff worked with stone supplied by Defendant.
 
The motion for summary adjudication of
the claims for breach of warranty and loss of consortium is DENIED.
 
F. Punitive Damages
 
Defendant argues that the claim for
punitive damages fails because Plaintiff cannot establish fraud, malice, or
oppression. Plaintiff has established a triable issue of fact as to fraudulent
concealment. This creates a triable issue of fact as to punitive damages.
 
The motion for summary adjudication of
the claim for punitive damages is DENIED.

BACKGROUND
 
On March 13, 2023, Plaintiffs Rodolfo
Garcia-Rosas and Alma Delia Llamas filed the operative first amended complaint
against Defendants Architectural Surfaces, Inc., et al., asserting causes of
action for (1) negligence; (2) strict liability – warning defect; (3) strict
liability – design defect; (4) fraudulent concealment; (5) breach of implied
warranties; and (6) loss of consortium. Plaintiff alleges he developed
silicosis and consequential injuries through his employment working with stone
products manufactured, distributed, and/or supplied by Defendants.
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
“The purpose of the law of summary
judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties'
pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in
fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Trial judges are required “to grant summary
judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)
 
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to
establish a defense. (CCP § 437c(p)(2).) Once the defendant has met that
burden, “the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one
or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.”
(Id.)  To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce “substantial
responsive evidence.” (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing
summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that
party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384,
389.)
 
A. Sophisticated User Defense
 
“The sophisticated user defense exempts
manufacturers from their typical obligation to provide product users with
warnings about the products' potential hazards. The defense is considered an
exception to the manufacturer's general duty to warn consumers, and therefore,
in most jurisdictions, if successfully argued, acts as an affirmative defense
to negate the manufacturer's duty to warn. 
[¶]  Under the sophisticated user
defense, sophisticated users need not be warned about dangers of which they are
already aware or should be aware. Because these sophisticated users are charged
with knowing the particular product's dangers, the failure to warn about those
dangers is not the legal cause of any harm that product may cause.”  (Johnson v. American Standard, Inc. (“Johnson”)
(2008) 43 Cal.4th 56, 65; see also 6 Witkin, Summary (11th ed.
2020), Torts §1321.)   
 
“A manufacturer is not liable to a
sophisticated user of its product for failure to warn of a risk, harm, or
danger, if the sophisticated user knew or should have known of that risk, harm,
or danger. It would be nearly impossible for a manufacturer to predict or
determine whether a given user or member of the sophisticated group actually
has knowledge of the dangers because of the infinite number of user
idiosyncrasies. For example, given users may have misread their training
manuals, failed to study the information in those manuals, or simply forgotten
what they were taught. However, individuals who represent that they are trained
or are members of a sophisticated group of users are saying to the world that
they possess the level of knowledge and skill associated with that class. If
they do not actually possess that knowledge and skill, that fact should not
give rise to liability on the part of the manufacturer.”  (Id. at 71.)
 
“Thus, in order to establish the
defense, the defendant must identify the relevant risk, show that sophisticated
users are already aware of the risk, and demonstrate that the plaintiff is a
member of the group of sophisticated users.” 
(Buckner v. Milwaukee Electric Tool Corp. (2013) 222 Cal.App.4th
522, 535.)  “In the context of the
sophisticated user defense, because the intended users are deemed to know of
the risks, manufacturers have no obligation to warn, and providing no warning
is appropriate. The focus of the defense, therefore, is whether the danger in
question was so generally known within the trade or profession that a
manufacturer should not have been expected to provide a warning specific to the
group to which plaintiff belonged.”  (Id.
at 534.)
 
The sophisticated user defense is
applicable to both negligence and strict liability causes of action based on
failure to warn.  (Id. at
71.)  The sophisticated user defense does
not apply to strict liability or negligence claims based on a design defect
risk-benefit theory.  (Johnson v.
Honeywell Int. (“Honeywell”) (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 549, 558
(sophisticated user defense did not bar HVAC technician's strict products
liability claim against refrigerant manufacturers, where claim was based on
design defect risk-benefit theory, rather than failure to warn; there is no
logical reason why defense based on need for warning should apply in design
defect case).)  However, where a design
defect claim is based on the consumer expectations test, which is based on the
expectations of the ordinary consumer, the sophisticated user defense
applies.  (Id. at 558, fn 4.)
 
“A user's sophistication is determined
at the time of his or her injury.  The
timeline focuses on the general population of sophisticated users and conforms
to the defense's purpose to eliminate any duty to warn when the expected user
population is generally aware of the risk at issue.”  (Moran v. Foster Wheeler Energy Corp.
(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 500, 511–512.) 
Thus, to establish the sophisticated user defense, defendant must
present admissible evidence establishing that the general population of
sophisticated users knew or should have known of the particular risk or danger
suffered by the plaintiff from the time of plaintiff’s first exposure
onward.  (Id. at 518; Scott v.
Ford Motor Co. (2014) 224 Cal.App.4th 1492, 1500-1501.) 
 
Defendant is required to “identify the
relevant risk, show that sophisticated users are already aware of the risk, and
demonstrate that the plaintiff is a member of the group of sophisticated
users.”  (Buckner, supra, 222
Cal.App.4th at 535.)  “In order to
establish the defense, a manufacturer must demonstrate that sophisticated users
of the product know what the risks are, including the degree of danger involved
(i.e., the severity of the potential injury), and how to use the product to
reduce or avoid the risks, to the extent that information is known to the
manufacturer.”  (Moran, supra,
246 Cal.App.4th at 516.)  
 
Defendant submits no evidence regarding
Plaintiff’s training, certification, or education. Instead, Defendant argues
Plaintiff is sophisticated user simply by virtue of his years of experience as
a stone fabricator. Defendant fails to establish the applicability of the
sophisticated user defense. The motion cannot be granted on this basis.
 
B. Causation
 
Defendant argues that it cannot be
liable for any of Plaintiff’s claims because it did not cause Plaintiff’s
injury. In support, Defendant presents evidence showing Plaintiff was only exposed
to 14 or 15 slabs supplied by Defendant in 2021 and that Plaintiff wore a
filtered mask and goggles while working with these slabs. Defendant asserts
that these slabs could not have caused Plaintiff’s injury because Plaintiff was
already experiencing pulmonary symptoms in 2019 and because the number of slabs
provided by Defendant relative to the total slabs Plaintiff worked with
(approximately 55,000 slabs) is minimal. 
 
In opposition, Plaintiff asserts that
Defendant has failed to show a lack of causation as they have admitted that
Plaintiff worked with stone slabs supplied by Defendant. Plaintiff also
presents the declaration of expert Dr. Kenneth Rosenman who opines, “Because a substantial amount of dust is generated from fabrication of
stone slabs and silicosis results from cumulative exposure to silica dust, it
is my opinion to a reasonable degree of medical probability, that all of Mr.
Garcia-Rosas’s identified and established exposures to the silica-containing
dust that he inhaled from the stone slabs products from the companies
identified above that he fabricated contributed to his total dose of inhaled
silica that caused his silicosis and fibrotic lung disease. There is no
scientific basis to exclude an identified respiratory dust exposure in a stone
countertop fabrication worker who has silicosis from causation of the worker’s
silicosis.” Dr. Rosenman also states, that exposure to Defendant’s products was
a substantial factor to Plaintiff’s harm “even though Mr. Garcia-Rosas wore a
mask and used wet processing methods when he fabricated artificial stone.” This
is sufficient to create a triable issue of fact as to causation.
 
C. Sophisticated Intermediary Defense
 
Under the sophisticated intermediary
doctrine, “a supplier may discharge its duty to warn end users about known or
knowable risks in the use of its product if it: (1) provides adequate warnings
to the product's immediate purchaser, or sells to a sophisticated purchaser
that it knows is aware or should be aware of the specific danger, and (2)
reasonably relies on the purchaser to convey appropriate warnings to downstream
users who will encounter the product. Because the sophisticated intermediary
doctrine is an affirmative defense, the supplier bears the burden of proving
that it adequately warned the intermediary, or knew the intermediary was aware
or should have been aware of the specific hazard, and reasonably relied on the
intermediary to transmit warnings.”  (Webb
v. Special Electric Co., Inc. (2016) 63 Cal.4th 167, 187.)  
 
“Like the sophisticated user defense,
the sophisticated intermediary defense applies to failure to warn claims
sounding in either strict liability or negligence.  As we have previously observed, there is
little functional difference between the two theories in the failure to warn
context.  In failure to warn cases,
whether asserted on negligence or strict liability grounds, there is but one
unitary theory of liability which is negligence based—the duty to use
reasonable care in promulgating a warning.” 
(Id.)  
 
“[T]he sophisticated intermediary
doctrine provides that a supplier can discharge its duty to warn if it provides
adequate warnings, or sells to a sufficiently sophisticated buyer, and
reasonably relies on the buyer to warn end users about the harm. Reasonable
reliance depends on all attendant circumstances and is typically a question of
fact for the jury.”  (Webb, supra,
63 Cal.4th 167, 180; see also 6 Witkin, Summary (11th
ed. 2024), Torts § 1322.) 
 
Defendant asserts Plaintiff’s employer
was a sophisticated intermediary and that the employer was independently
obligated to maintain a safe workplace under OSHA/Cal-OSHA. In opposition,
Plaintiff disputes that Defendant provided adequate warnings to Plaintiff’s
employers. Plaintiff also asserts that Defendant has not provided evidence
showing it provided any warnings and/or safety data sheets or any hazard or
safety information to his workplaces. This is sufficient to create a triable
issue of fact as to the sophisticated intermediary defense. The motion cannot
be granted on this basis.
 
The motion for summary judgment is
DENIED. The motion for summary adjudication of claims for negligence and strict
liability is DENIED.
 
C. Breach of Implied Warranty
 
Defendant argues Plaintiff’s claims for
breach of warranty fail because Plaintiff was a sophisticated user, Plaintiff’s
employer was a sophisticated intermediary and because Defendant did not cause
Plaintiff’s injuries. As stated, Plaintiff has established triable issues of
fact as to all of these arguments.
 
The motion for summary adjudication of
the claims for breach of warranty is DENIED.
 
D. Fraudulent Concealment and Punitive
Damages
 
The elements of fraud are: “(a)
misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b)
knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce
reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Charnay v.
Cobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 184.) California law recognizes four
circumstances in which a nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable
fraud: “(1) when the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the
plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not
known to the plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively conceals a material
fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the defendant makes partial representations
but also suppresses some material facts.” 
(Heliotis v. Schuman (1986) 181 Cal. App. 3d 646, 651.)  
 
Citing Bigler-Engler v. Breg, Inc. (2017)
7 Cal.App.5th 276, 310-311 and LiMandri v. Judkins (1997) 52
Cal.App.4th 326, 336-337, Defendant argues it was not in a fiduciary
relationship with Plaintiff nor did they have a transactional relationship
involving “direct dealings,” such as “seller and buyer, employer and
prospective employee, doctor and patient, or contractual arrangement.” 
 
The Court disagrees that fraudulent
concealment is barred as a matter of law on this ground.  In Jones v. ConocoPhillips Co. (2011)
198 Cal.App.4th 1187, plaintiffs alleged a duty of disclosure based on (1)
defendant Dow’s awareness of the toxic nature of their products, (2) Dow’s sole
knowledge of that fact; and (3) decedent who worked with the product did not
have that knowledge available to him.  (Jones,
supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at 1199.)  The
decedent in Jones, like Plaintiff, was an employee of employers who
purchased and used chemicals from various manufacturers, and suffered various
health issues as a result of exposure to those chemicals.  (Id. at 1198.)  “Although, typically, a duty to disclose
arises when a defendant owes a fiduciary duty to a plaintiff, a duty to
disclose may also arise when a defendant possesses or exerts control over
material facts not readily available to the plaintiff.”  (Id.)
 
The analysis in Jones was based
on LiMandri, which stated that, outside of a fiduciary relationship, a
duty to disclose can arise in three other circumstances:  when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of
material facts not known to the plaintiff; when the defendant actively conceals
a material fact from the plaintiff; and when the defendant makes partial
representations but also suppresses some material facts.  (LiMandri, supra, 52
Cal.App.4th at 336-337.)  “These three
circumstances, however, presuppose the existence of some other relationship
between the plaintiff and defendant in which a duty to disclose can arise.”  (Id.) 
Because Jones relied explicitly on this discussion in LiMandri,
Jones is reasonably interpreted to imply that “some other relationship,”
such as a transactional relationship, exists between an employee who uses a
hazardous chemical purchased by his or her employer and the manufacturer or
distributor from whom the employer purchased that product.  (LiMandri, supra, 52
Cal.App.4th at 337.)
 
Such an interpretation is supported by Peterson
v. Lamb Rubber Co. (1960) 54 Cal.2d 339, 347.  Peterson held that an employee is in
contractual privity with a manufacturer for purposes of a breach of implied
warranty claim:  “[I]t is a matter of
common knowledge, and of course known to vendor-manufacturers, that most businesses
are carried on by means of the assistance of employees and that equipment or
supplies purchased by employers will in actual use be handled by the employes,
who in this respect may be said to stand in the shoes of the employer.”  (Peterson, supra, 54 Cal.2d at
347.)  By this reasoning, an employee of
a company that purchases a toxic chemical for use in the employer’s business is
in a “transactional relationship” with the manufacturer of that chemical and a
duty to disclose exists.  
 
Bigler-Engler does not change this analysis.  Bigler-Engler merely reiterated LiMandri’s
statement that “some other relationship” must exist to find a duty of
disclosure where there is no fiduciary relationship.  Bilger-Engler held that such a
relationship must be the result of some transaction.  (Bigler-Engler, supra, 7 Cal.App.5th
at 312.)  “Such a transaction must
necessarily arise from direct dealings between the plaintiff and the defendant;
it cannot arise between the defendant and the public at large.”  Id. 
The Court reversed a jury verdict on the plaintiff’s intentional
concealment claim on grounds that the record did not support a finding of a
duty of disclosure.  (Id. at 315.)
 
Bigler-Engler is also factually
distinguishable.  The plaintiff in Bigler-Engler
was a patient who was injured by a medical device prescribed by her
physician.  The plaintiff also sued the
manufacturer of the medical device on several theories, including fraudulent
concealment.  The Court found that there
were no “direct dealings” between plaintiff and the manufacturer to support a
duty of disclosure.  Plaintiff is suing
the manufacturers who sold stone product to his employers or hirers. Plaintiff
came in contact with product as an employee or hired contractor of his
employers or hirers, who purportedly had direct dealings with the
manufacturers.  Plaintiff came into
contact with the chemicals as an agent of his employers.  Plaintiff was not a “member of the public at
large.”  Bigler-Engler did not
examine whether the specific relationship at issue here satisfies the “some
other relationship” or “direct dealing” (manufacturer/seller to employer/buyer
to employee/agent) requirement to impose a duty of disclosure on a defendant
who is not a fiduciary.  Jones did
examine this exact type of relationship and found it gave rise to a duty of
disclosure sufficient to support a fraudulent concealment cause of action.  
 
The motion for summary adjudication of
the claims for fraud and punitive damages is DENIED.

and opposition.
 
BACKGROUND
 
On March 13, 2023, Plaintiffs Rodolfo
Garcia-Rosas and Alma Delia Llamas filed the operative first amended complaint
against Defendants Architectural Surfaces, Inc., et al., asserting causes of
action for (1) negligence; (2) strict liability – warning defect; (3) strict
liability – design defect; (4) fraudulent concealment; (5) breach of implied
warranties; and (6) loss of consortium. Plaintiff alleges he developed
silicosis and consequential injuries through his employment working with stone
products manufactured, distributed, and/or supplied by Defendants.
 
 
 
ANALYSIS
 
“The purpose of the law of summary
judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut through the parties'
pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations, trial is in
fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co.
(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Trial judges are required “to grant summary
judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably
deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or
evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that
the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.)
 
As to each claim as framed by the
complaint, the defendant moving for summary judgment must satisfy the initial
burden of proof by presenting facts to negate an essential element, or to
establish a defense. (CCP § 437c(p)(2).) Once the defendant has met that
burden, “the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one
or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.”
(Id.)  To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce “substantial
responsive evidence.” (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.) Courts “liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing
summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that
party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384,
389.)
 
A. Causation
 
Defendant Stoneville USA, Inc. asserts
that all of Plaintiffs’ claims fail for lack of causation. Defendant represents
that Plaintiff has no evidence showing Defendant distributed crystalline silica-containing products to Plaintiff’s employers during
the relevant period and that Plaintiff testified that he had no specific
recollection of fabricating artificial stone slab that he believed was
distributed by Stoneville. Defendant, however, concedes that Plaintiff
testified that on several occasions in 2020 or 2021, when he worked for
Bradeskoval, he saw Stoneville trucks make deliveries of stone slabs to that
employer and that some of these deliveries contained artificial stones.
 
In opposition, Plaintiff argues that Defendant has not met its burden to
show a lack of causation because Defendant concedes that Plaintiff remembered
several deliveries of artificial stone from Defendant to Plaintiff’s employer.
The Court agrees. These facts show there is a triable issue for the jury. The
motion cannot be granted on this basis.
 
Defendant also argues that Plaintiff’s employers are the intervening
cause of Plaintiff’s injuries because they failed to comply with the Hazard
Communication Standards.
Defendant’s argument and evidence, at best, establish Plaintiff’s employer’s
statutory duty under the Hazard Communications Standard to provide warnings and
protection against the dangers of exposure to the products in question.  They do not bar Plaintiff’s claims against
Defendant.  Defendant cites no authority
holding that the Hazard Communications Standard makes employers solely
responsible or liable for employee injuries due to chemical exposure. The
motion cannot be granted on this ground.
 
Defendant’s motion for summary judgment
is DENIED.
 
B. Breach of Warranty
 
Defendant argues that the claims for
breach of warranty fail because Plaintiff cannot prove Defendant sold any stone
products to Plaintiff’s employer. As stated, Plaintiff testified to picking up
multiple orders of stone from Defendant. This is sufficient to create a triable
issue of fact. 
 
The motion for summary adjudication of
the claims for breach of warranty is DENIED. 
 
C. Fraudulent Concealment and Punitive
Damages
 
The elements of fraud are: “(a) misrepresentation
(false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity
(or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d)
justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Charnay v. Cobert
(2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 184.) California law recognizes four circumstances
in which a nondisclosure or concealment may constitute actionable fraud: “(1)
when the defendant is in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff; (2) when
the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to the
plaintiff; (3) when the defendant actively conceals a material fact from the
plaintiff; and (4) when the defendant makes partial representations but also
suppresses some material facts.”  (Heliotis
v. Schuman (1986) 181 Cal. App. 3d 646, 651.)  
 
Defendant argues that the claims for
fraud and punitive damages fail because Plaintiff’s employer was the
intervening tortfeasor and because Defendant provided all the relevant safety
information to Plaintiff’s employer. In opposition,
Plaintiff asserts that Stoneville failed to disclose the true extent and nature
of the hazards of its products, which it was under a duty to disclose pursuant
to both the Hazard Communication Standard and California common law. Plaintiff also
represents that Stoneville took no steps to provide workers like Garcia-Rosas
with copies of any warnings or safety data sheets and that Stoneville and its
management knew or should have known that inhalation of dust from its stone
products were dangerous to workers like Garcia-Rosas, but concealed the true
and full nature and extent of those hazards by failing to provide adequate
warnings and/or safety data sheets. This is sufficient to create a triable
issue of fact as to fraudulent concealment. 
 
The motion for summary adjudication of the claims for fraudulent
concealment and punitive damages is DENIED.
 
D. Loss of Consortium
 
Defendant asserts the claim for loss of consortium fails because the
underlying claims fail. As stated, Plaintiff has established triable issues of
fact as to the underlying claims. 
 
The motion for summary adjudication of the claim for loss of consortium
is DENIED.

party.” (Dore v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384,

A. Causation
 
Defendant asserts that Plaintiff cannot
establish causation because Plaintiff testified that he had no personal
knowledge of working with Defendant’s products and because Plaintiff has no
documents showing Defendant sold products to Plaintiff’s employer during the
relevant time period. In opposition, Plaintiff presents his deposition
testimony showing he remembers working with stone slabs
supplied by Walker & Zanger, and remembers his visits to Walker &
Zanger’s store. This is sufficient to create a triable issue of fact as to
causation. 
 
The motion for summary judgment is DENIED.
 
B. Punitive Damages
 
Defendant argues that the claim for punitive damages fails because
Plaintiff cannot establish causation and because Plaintiff cannot establish
Defendant engaged in despicable, malicious, or oppressive conduct perpetrated
in conscious disregard of the rights and safety of Plaintiff. In opposition,
Plaintiff presents evidence showing Defendant failed to provide workers like
Garcia-Rosas with copies of any warnings or safety data sheets. Plaintiff also
argues that Defendant has failed to meet their initial burden by failing to provide
any declarations or other evidence showing Defendant did not conceal
information relating to the safety of their products. This is sufficient to
create a triable issue of fact as to entitlement to punitive damages. 
 
The motion for summary adjudication of the claim for punitive damages is
DENIED.
 
C. Loss of Consortium
 
Defendant asserts the claim for loss of consortium fails because the
underlying claims fail. As stated, Plaintiff has established triable issues of
fact as to the underlying claims.
 
The motion for summary adjudication of the claim for loss of consortium
is DENIED.
