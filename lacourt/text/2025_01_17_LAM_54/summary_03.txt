And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendants' motion to compel arbitration based on an arbitration agreement executed by Plaintiff on April 6, 2022. The agreement provides for the resolution of all claims or controversies through arbitration, including those related to sexual harassment or assault claims. However, the judge finds that the agreement is unenforceable under the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (EFASASHA), which exempts cases related to sexual harassment or assault claims from arbitration. The judge notes that all of Plaintiff's claims relate to the sexual harassment and assault claims, and therefore, the entire case is exempt from arbitration. The judge denies Defendants' motion to compel arbitration.
