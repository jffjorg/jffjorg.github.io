Department 54, Judge Maurice A. Leiter
Motion to Seal
Moving Party: Doe Defendant Omid Lavi
Responding Party: None
 
T/R:     THE MOTION TO SEAL IS GRANTED.
 
DEFENDANTS TO NOTICE.  
 
If the parties wish to submit on the
tentative, please email the courtroom at SMCdept54@lacourt.org with
notice to opposing counsel (or self-represented party) before 8:00 am on the
day of the hearing. 
The Court considers the moving papers.
No opposition has been received.  
 
“The court may order that a record be
filed under seal only if it expressly finds facts that establish: (1) There
exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the
record; (2) The overriding interest supports sealing the record; (3) A
substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced
if the record is not sealed; (4) The proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and
(5) No less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.”  (CRC Rule 2.550(d).)  “The motion or application must be
accompanied by a memorandum and a declaration containing facts sufficient to
justify the sealing.”  (CRC Rule
2.551(b)(1).)
 
Defendant moves to file a settlement
agreement between the parties under seal. Defendant represents that the
agreement contains a confidentiality agreement and cannot be disclosed to the
public. This is sufficient to show an overriding interest justifying the
sealing of this document. The Court finds that the factors in CRC Rule 2.550(d)
have been satisfied. The motion to seal is GRANTED.
