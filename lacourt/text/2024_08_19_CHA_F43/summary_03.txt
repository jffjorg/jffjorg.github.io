And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the defendants' motion to strike Plaintiff's request for punitive damages and related allegations. The judge finds that Plaintiff's allegations are conclusory and do not provide specific factual allegations to support a claim for punitive damages. The judge notes that Plaintiff's complaint alleges that the defendants acted with malice, fraud, or oppression, but does not provide specific facts to support these allegations.

The judge has also denied Plaintiff's motion for trial preference, finding that the parties have agreed to a mediation date of December 2, 2024, and a trial date of February 18, 2025, making the motion moot.
