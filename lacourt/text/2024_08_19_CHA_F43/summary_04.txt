Summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling sustaining the Defendant's demurrer to the Plaintiff's First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Causes of Action with leave to amend. The demurrer was filed in opposition to the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint, which alleged seven causes of action against the Defendant, including breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing, bad faith denial of insurance claim, breach of contractual duty to pay a covered insurance claim, intentional misrepresentation, violation of California Business and Professional Code, unjust enrichment, and defamation. The Judge found that the Plaintiff failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the Defendant with regard to these causes of action. The Court also sustained the demurrer to the Plaintiff's Sixth Cause of Action, which alleged unjust enrichment, without leave to amend, as unjust enrichment is not a valid cause of action under California law. The Plaintiff is given 30 days to amend the complaint.
