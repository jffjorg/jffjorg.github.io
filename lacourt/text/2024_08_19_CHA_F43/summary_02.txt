And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has granted the Plaintiff's motion to deem the Requests for Admissions admitted. The Plaintiff, Bank of America N.A., served the Defendant, Alonzo Salmon, with Requests for Admissions on August 16, 2023, but the Defendant failed to respond. Despite attempts to resolve the discovery problem informally, the Defendant did not respond. As a result, the Plaintiff filed a motion to deem the Requests for Admissions admitted, which was initially heard on April 29, 2024, but was placed off calendar due to the parties' failure to appear. The motion was refiled on June 14, 2024, and this time, no opposition was filed. The Court granted the motion because the Defendant failed to respond to the Requests for Admissions within the required 30-day timeframe, thereby waiving any objections.
