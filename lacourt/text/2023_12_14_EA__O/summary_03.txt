And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the defendants' motion to set aside the default and default judgment is granted. The default judgment was entered against the defendants, Jinggang Yan and Xiuhong Liang, on April 6, 2023, for a total amount of $9,613,252.20. The defendants claim that they were not personally served with the summons and complaint, and therefore, the default judgment is void.

The judge has reviewed the evidence presented by the defendants, including their testimony that they did not live at the property where the process server claimed to have served them. The judge has also considered the authorities cited by the defendants, including cases that support the proposition that a judgment is void if it is rendered without personal jurisdiction over the defendant.

The judge has concluded that the defendants have provided adequate evidence to demonstrate that they were not served with the summons and complaint, and therefore, the default and default judgment are void. The judge has granted the defendants' motion to set aside the default and default judgment, and the case will be scheduled for further hearing.
