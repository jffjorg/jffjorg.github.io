On December 12, 2023, the court received Plaintiff’s
reply. 
 
Legal
Standard
 
The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve
the status quo pending final resolution upon a trial. (See Scaringe v.
J.C.C. Enterprises, Inc. (1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1536.) The status quo has
been defined to mean the last actual peaceable, uncontested status which
preceded the pending controversy. (14859 Moorpark Homeowner’s Assn. v. VRT
Corp. (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1396. 1402.) The burden of proof is on the
plaintiff as moving party. (O’Connell v. Superior Court (2006) 141
Cal.App.4th 1452, 1481.) A plaintiff seeking injunctive relief must show the
absence of an adequate damages remedy at law. (Code Civ. Proc. § 526(4); Thayer
Plymouth Center, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors (1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 300,
307.)   
 
The trial court considers two factors in determining
whether to issue a preliminary injunction: (1) the likelihood the plaintiff
will prevail on the merits of its case at trial,[3]
and (2) the interim harm the plaintiff is likely to sustain if the injunction
is denied as compared to the harm the defendant is likely to suffer if the
court grants a preliminary injunction. (Code Civ. Proc. § 526(a); Husain v.
McDonald’s Corp. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 860, 866-67.) The balancing of harm
between the parties “involves consideration of such things as the inadequacy
of other remedies, the degree of irreparable harm, and the necessity of
preserving the status quo.” (Husain, supra, 205 Cal.App.4th at 867,
emphasis added.) Thus, a preliminary injunction may not issue without some
showing of potential entitlement to such relief.  (Doe v. Wilson
(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 296, 304.) 
 
The decision to grant a preliminary injunction generally
lies within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed
on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. (Thornton v. Carlson (1992) 4
Cal.App.4th 1249, 1255.) 
 
A preliminary injunction ordinarily cannot take effect
unless and until the plaintiff provides an undertaking for damages which the
enjoined defendant may sustain by reason of the injunction if the court finally
decides that the plaintiff was not entitled to the injunction. (See Code Civ.
Proc. § 529(a); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1150(f); City of South San
Francisco v. Cypress Lawn Cemetery Assn. (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 916,
920.) 
 
Discussion
 
Categories 2
through 13 are at issue. The categories are as follows:
 
Category Two -
Release of Heritage’s Official Phone Number. ..........................  
Category Three
– Disclosure of Phone Records.
Category Four, Six, Eleven and Twelve –Regarding Heritage’s Propriety Information and External
Devices.  
Category Five
– Refrain From Entering Into Contracts or Obligations On Behalf of Heritage
Category Seven
– Return Heritage’s Devices and Accessories 
Category Eight
– Return Heritage’s Vehicle
....................................................... 
Category Nine
– Return Heritage’s Issued Laptop 
Category Ten –
Return Heritage’s $20,000 That was Unlawfully Withdrawn 
Category Thirteen – Cease and Desist From Use of Heritage’s CSLB License For Unauthorized
Jobs.  
 
Factor 1: Likelihood of Prevailing on the Merits
 
In its supplemental opposition, Defendants contends that
Plaintiffs have “not made any attempt to cite to or expressly prove the
elements of any of its causes of action.” (Defendant’s Brief p. 9:7-9,
italics added.) 
 
That is not so as
in its moving papers focused on the conversion and breach of fiduciary duty
COAs. (Plaintiff’s P&A p. 10:14-16.) The
court agrees that those two COAs are the most pertinent to the TRO and OSC.

 
For example, the seventh COA for Director Removal
(Complaint ¶91) is predicated upon the allegation that Defendant converted $20,000
of corporate funds from Heritage for his personal use (i.e., conversion COA)
and is likewise related to the allegation that Defendant abused his authority
as a director (i.e., forming the breach of fiduciary COA). Similarly, the 4th
COA for interference with contracts COA and 5th COA for interference
with business relationships are predicated upon similar allegations found within
the conversion COA. (See e.g., ¶64 [Defendant “converted Heritage’s property
and assets, including Heritage’s main phone number by diverting all calls to
his personal phone number, eliminating Heritage’s ability to effectively
communicate with its clients.”]; see ¶44 [“converting files, records, and other
property”].) 
 
Thus, by discussing the conversion and breach of
fiduciary claims, Plaintiffs are tacitly addressing the other COAs.
 
With that, the court turns to the merits of those two
COAs. 
 
a.    
Conversion 
 
CACI 2100 defines conversions as the “wrongful exercise of dominion over
the property of another.” Specifically, the elements of a conversion claim are: (1) the
plaintiff's ownership or right to possession of the property; (2) the
defendant's conversion by
a wrongful act or disposition of property rights; and (3) damages.” (Lee v. Hanley (2015) 61 Cal.4th
1225, 1240 [191 Cal.Rptr.3d 536, 354 P.3d 334].)  As to the first element, conversion is
an act of dominion wrongfully exerted over
another's “personal property in denial of or inconsistent with his rights therein.”[4] (Weiss v. Marcus (1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 590, 599, 124
Cal.Rptr. 297.) 
As for the second element, conversion is as strict
liability tort meaning it only requires that the
defendant have intentionally done the act depriving the plaintiff of his or her
rightful possession. (Voris v.
Lampert (2019) 7 Cal.5th 1141, 1158 [250 Cal.Rptr.3d 779, 446 P.3d 284].) 
 
Here, Heritage, as corporation, is a distinct legal form
from its shareholders and shareholders such that they do not “own corporate
property nor the corporate earnings.” (Plaintiffs’ P&A p. 10, quoting Miller
v. McColgan (1941) 17 Cal.2d 432, 421.) And there are allegations that
Defendant, as a shareholder, took, amongst other things, Heritage’s money,
Heritage’s customer files, Heritage’s propriety data, Heritage’s personnel
records, Heritage’s electronic files and data, and mobile devices. As a result
of the conversion, the damages include cancelled contracts and lost business.
Of import, Defendant concedes he took the property in opposition (See
Opp. p. 16:22-23 [“McPherson does not need or want the vehicle and it can be
picked up by Heritage whenever it wants to pick it up.”]; see e.g., Opp. p.
17:19-20 [“The funds have been deposited in a separate bank account for
safekeeping.”]) but that he did it for good reason: to protect the
company from Harden’s and Mehserdjian’s alleged “numerous fraudulent and
improper transfers of Heritage funds.” (See CC ¶30.) But Defendant’s actions do
not fall under a recognized exception to conversion. 
 
Therefore, as Heritage holds title to all the properties
and Defendant took the property, Heritage will therefore likely prevail at
trial on its claim for conversion. 
 
b.    
Breach of Fiduciary Duties
 
The elements of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary
duty are the existence of a fiduciary duty, its breach, and damages where the
damages are proximately caused by the breach. (Meister v. Mensinger
(2014) 230 Cal. App. 4th 381, 395.) 
 
Here, Defendant is a shareholder of Heritage by his role
as the director and president of Heritage, and it is undisputed that officers
and directors owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders. (Motion p. 12, citing Small
v. Fritz Companies, Inc. (2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 179.) With the role as a
fiduciary, various duties arise including the duty to “act in good faith for
the interests of the corporation.” (Motion p. 12, quoting Professional
Hockey Corp. v. World Hockey Assn. (1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 410, 414.)
Defendant allegedly breached those duties by, in short, targeting specific
confidential information that comprises the very foundation of Heritage’s
business. Consequently, Defendant’s alleged breached has affected the
corporation’s ability to operate (i.e., damages).
 
Therefore, Heritage will therefore likely prevail at
trial on its claim for breach of fiduciary duty. 
 
Factor 2: Irreparable Harm 
 
At the outset, the court notes that should any of the
categories pertain to tangible property or money, the court will not find
irreparable harm. 
 
Normally, an injunction will not issue where only money is involved. The
rationale is that there is no threat of irreparable harm, because monetary losses are compensable in
damages. (See Rutter Group, A. Injunctions, Cal.
Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 9(II) ¶ 9:853 ff.) Plaintiffs have not advanced the
argument that Heritage has no funds such that the $20,000 is needed to keep
operations afloat (i.e., that there will be imminent irreparable harm
without the money). To the
contrary, Plaintiffs mention that the corporation is profitable. (See
e.g., Complaint ¶18 [“After several years of Heritage not making any profit,
finally in the beginning of April 2023, monthly sales doubled, and it appeared
that Heritage had started to turn the corner and was tracking towards profitability.
Although the prior three years were not profitable, Heritage finally started to
operate at a positive cash flow.”].)
 
The same rationale applies to the 2000 Ford Model F250
because it is replaceable. 
 
Thus, as to Categories
8 (2000 Ford Model F250) and Category 10 (20,000 in Cash), the
motion is DENIED. 
 
As for the remaining categories, they all pertain to
Heritage’s ability to operate. For example, the (714) 606-7202 phone number is
both Heritage’s business number and Defendant’s personal number (which
he has had for the past 15 years). Thus, neither party disputes that customers
and clients to contact Heritage. In fact, despite Defendant’s argument in
opposition that Heritage has provided evidence indicating that Defendant has
received Heritage work-related calls, Plaintiffs in Reply correctly observe that
Defendant’s declaration states otherwise: “I have only received approximately
three phone calls since October 17, 2023 related to Heritage or Rolhard
business.” (McPherson Dec., ¶38.) 
 
But the phone line and the device are not Defendant’s
property because Defendant has not paid for the phone line or the associated
devices for this phone line for years; Heritage has made all payments.
(Reply p. 5.) Thus, it is traceable to Heritage’s property, not
Defendant. In fact, Defendant corroborates this statement by attesting that
since Heritage has frozen him out of the company, Defendant has “tried to take
on the responsibility of making installment payments on these devices,
including paying $242.00 for them on November 1, 2023.” (McPherson Dec., ¶35.)
(Of note: T-Mobile refuses to transfer the line to Defendant until the matter
is resolved.) 
 
Relatedly, as to the phone records, while Defendant is
concerned with “privacy and misuse” (Opp. p. 13), Defendant cites no law to
support his conclusion about privacy. 
 
To the contrary, as noted by Plaintiffs in Reply, the
argument is unpersuasive for two reasons. First, the law does not recognize
a reasonable expectation of privacy in call log information. (Reply p. 5,
citing United States v. Lustig (9th Cir. 1977) 555 F.2d 737, 747 n. 10;
see also United States v. Reed (9th Cir. 2009) 575 F.3d 900, 914-915
(there is no expectation of privacy in call origination, length and time of
call because no content information is involved)].) Second, by voluntarily associating
the phone line with Heritage and using a company device, Defendant likely waived
any privacy right. (Reply p. 6:2-4.)
 
Therefore, the
court GRANTS the injunction as to Categories 2 (Phone Number) and Category 3
(Phone Records). 
 
Categories 4, 6, 11, and 12: Documentation and Devices
and Category 7: Devices and Category 9: Laptop.  
 
The court finds these categories duplicative of category
1 (Preservation of evidence). To the extent there is some differentiation, the
court is somewhat persuaded by Defendant’s argument which is not addressed by
Plaintiffs in reply: why can’t Heritage reset the user and password
information? 
 
The injunction as to these categories are TBD. 
 
Category 5: Entering Contracts on Behalf of Heritage
 
Heritage’s claim and request rests on speculation
that Defendant has or will attempt to enter into contracts or obligations on
behalf of Heritage. 
 
According to the complaint, from about May through August
2023, Defendant “started scheming, unbeknownst to Harden and Mehserdjian, to
damage Heritage, dismantle it, and to appropriate and/or take Heritage’s
corporate assets for his personal benefit to the detriment of Heritage and its
two other shareholders.” (Complaint P64.) As months have gone by and there is
no evidence that Defendant has entered into contracts with Heritage’s
existing or potential clients, the court finds the speculation insufficient for
equitable relief. 
 
Furthermore, the court finds that granting the injunction
as to the return of the phone (it would prevent clients from
communicating with Defendant) and disclosure of phone records (to determine if
Defendant has called clients) would inherently solve this category. 
 
Therefore, the
injunction is DENIED as to category 5. 
 
Category 13 - CSLB License No. 1061808
 
According to Defendant, he was issued his contractor’s
license on October 29, 2019. On or about December 30, 2019, Defendant
associated Heritage with his Contractor’s License as the acting Responsible
Managing Officer (“RMO”) for Heritage, and the associated license for Heritage
was license no. 1061808. (Opp. p. 6:10-12.) Later, however, Defendant removed
both Harden and Mehserdjian from listed officers on Heritage’s license. This
did not affect Heritage’s ability to continue conducting business under its license
so long as McPherson remained in a supervisory and oversight role as its RMO.
 
Now, Heritage is seeking an order forbidding Defendant
from “conducting business with Heritage’s license and permitting
Heritage to continue conducting business under the license.” (Opp. p. 18:4-7,
emphasis added.) Thus, by Defendant’s own framing, Defendant has no
ownership right to Heritage’s license. (See also Opp. p. 18:23-24 [“As a
point of clarification as well, [Defendant] did not remove Heritage’s license
from it.”].) 
 
In opposition, Defendant explains that even if Heritage owns
the license, as the RMO, any act or omission by a company can be deemed an
act or omission by him. Thus, he can potentially lose his license based on
Heritage actions while associated with his license. (Opp. p. 18.) The Reply
does not address this argument.
 
Indeed, based on the court’s research, the CSLB recently
warned licensees of the “perils” of “renting” a qualifier. Renting a qualifier
means that a non-licensed contracting business pays an individual who holds a
California contractor’s license to act as the RMO of a construction company,
when that person has no actual involvement in the day-to-day operations of the
company. However, according to Cal. Business and Professional Code Section
7068.1, the RMO (here, Defendant), must exercise direct supervision and control
of its contracting operations. If the licensed individual is not doing so,
or if any of the other business officers, general partners, or employees break
the law, the RMO can lose his/her qualifying license. 
 
But the court finds that the potential harm exceeds that
of Defendant potentially losing his license, but harm to the corporation
itself. After all, under Business and Professions Code Section 7122.5, that
act be a cause of disciplinary action for the corporation itself, which will
presumably be public information reflecting poorly on the corporation.
 
Thus, though the court is cognizant that without this
license all operations will cease, in denying the injunction as to this
category, the court is effectively protecting Heritage from irreparable
harm. 
 
Therefore, the
court DENIES the injunction as to Category No. 13. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing, the motion is GRANTED in part and
DENIED in part and TBD in part. Bond will be discussed at the hearing but will
not be imposed of the arbitrary $1 million amount requested by Defendant.
