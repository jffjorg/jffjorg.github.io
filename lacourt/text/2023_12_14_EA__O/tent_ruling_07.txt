[1] The court will inquire whether the issue of bond
as to category 1 was discussed. As category 1 was granted, the court will
not focus on the category in this ruling. 
 


[2] Of pertinence to the instant motion,
Defendant/Cross-Defendant alleges that Plaintiffs spent and took large amounts
of money from Heritage and misrepresented those transactions as something else
in the company books and records and took and used company funds and resources
for their personal benefit or other purpose not benefiting the company. (CC ¶83.) 


[3] This is so because a cause of action must exist
before a court may grant a request for injunctive relief. (Allen v. City of
Sacramento (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 41, 65.) 


[4] The
court notes this definition as it is unclear whether some of the non-tangible
items are related to a property interest (i.e., a phone number). However, as
neither party has addressed the issue, or, as Defendant has not taken issue
with it, the court determines that all the categories at issue relate to
Heritage’s personal property.
