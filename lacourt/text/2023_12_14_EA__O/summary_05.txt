And here is the English-text summary of the tentative ruling:

The Judge has granted Counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel for Defendant Camilo Alberto. The motion was filed on November 15, 2023, citing that the attorney-client relationship has been severed, making it impossible for Counsel to effectively represent the client. The Judge has concluded that the motion should be granted due to Counsel's compliance with all California Rules of Court Rule 3.1362, lack of substantive motions on the calendar, and the relatively new nature of the action. The motion is effective upon service of the court's order relieving Counsel to Plaintiff, Defendant, and all other parties who have appeared in the case.
