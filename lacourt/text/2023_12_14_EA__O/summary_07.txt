```

And here is the English-text summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court will not focus on Category 1 of the bond issue, as it has already been granted. The defendant alleges that the plaintiffs spent and took large amounts of money from Heritage, and misrepresented these transactions in the company's books and records. The court notes that a cause of action must exist before granting injunctive relief, citing Allen v. City of Sacramento (2015). The court also notes that it is unclear whether some of the non-tangible items at issue relate to a property interest, but neither party has addressed this issue, and the court determines that all categories at issue relate to Heritage's personal property.
