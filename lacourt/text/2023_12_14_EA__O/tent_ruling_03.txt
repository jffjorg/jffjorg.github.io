total amount of $9,613,252.20.

On November 30, 2023, Plaintiff filed its opposition. 
 
On December

Discussion
 
Defendants
move to set aside the default judgment because they were not personally served.

According to
the POS, process server Ely Whaba personally served both Defendants on October
12, 2022 at 9:30 a.m. at 10 Sea Glass, Newport Coast, CA 92657. However,
according to Defendants, they do not live there. Defendants rented the
property from November 2018 until May 2021, but since May 2021, they have
not lived there since. The court emphasizes the fact that Defendants rented the
property because upon expiration of the lease (though not provided),
Defendants’ “I was not there” statement is sufficient because another
tenant presumably lived there. (Opp. p. 5.)[1]
To the extent that Defendants were to also state where they were on that
time and at that time, Plaintiff does not cite any authorities. (Reply
p. 4:6-8.) 
 
Therefore,
they were not nor could have been present at 10 Sea Glass on the day of
purported service. 
 
In
Opposition, Plaintiff argue that a motion to set aside a void-in-fact
judgment must be brought within six months by citing to Ramos v. Homeward Residential, Inc. (2014)
223 Cal.App.4th 1434, 1440. But, for one, as noted by Defendant in Reply, relief pursuant to section 473(d)
may be made at any time. (See Manson, Iver & York v. Black
(2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 36, 42) (emphasis added). Even assuming that the motion
must have been within 6 months, the 
the Ramos
court merely mentioned the six-month limit in passing but did not actually
decide any timeliness issue because the court found the judgment to be void on
its face (improper service upon a corporation) and affirmed the trial court’s
decision to set aside the void judgment. (C.f., Reply p. 1, quoting Rockefeller
Tech. Invs. (Asia) VII v. Changzhou SinoType Tech. Co., Ltd.
(2018) 24 Cal. App. 5th 115, 136–137 [“Because SinoType was never properly
served with the summons and petition, the trial court never obtained personal
jurisdiction over it. The resulting judgment— whether or not void on its
face—‘was ... therefore void, not merely voidable, as violating fundamental due
process.’ … It therefore could be set aside ‘at any time’ …‚ including, as
in this case, 15 months after entry of the judgment.”]; see also Reply p. 2,
citing Rogers v. Silverman (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d); see also City of Los Angeles v. Morgan (1951) 105 Cal.App.2d 726, 730; see Lovato v. Santa Fe
International Corp. (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 549, 553 [Under the due process
clause of the federal Constitution a personal judgment rendered without service
of process on, or legal notice to, a defendant is not merely voidable, but
void, in the absence of a voluntary appearance or waiver.].)  
 
Thus,
Defendants have provided adequate evidence that they were not served with the
summons and complaint, rendering the default and default judgment void. Should
there be ample and recent authority showing that under said
facts, (i.e., Defendants allege they were not personally served, provide
evidence of such, and default judgment entered), Plaintiff is at the hearing to
present at least five additional cases. Then the court may reconsider
its tentative ruling. 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on the foregoing and abiding by the public policy
favoring adjudication of cases on their merits, the motion is granted.
