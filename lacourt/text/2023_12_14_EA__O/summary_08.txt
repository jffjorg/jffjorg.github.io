And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has granted Counsel's Motion to Be Relieved as Counsel for Defendant Camilo Alexander Alberto. The motion was filed on November 15, 2023, and the case is a real property dispute involving partition by sale of real property. The plaintiff is Andrade Financial, a California corporation, and the defendants are Camilo Alberto, Raymundo D. Villa, NBS Default Services, LLC, Mill City Mortgage Loan Trust 2018-3, and the Los Angeles County Treasurer and Tax Collector. The case was filed on April 5, 2023, and since then, various motions and answers have been filed. The stipulation regarding lien priority and non-participation of Mill City Mortgage Loan Trust 2018-3 was filed on August 10, 2023. Counsel Ronald Norman seeks to be relieved as counsel for Camilo Alberto because the "attorney-client relationship has been severed" such that counsel can no longer effectively represent the client. The judge has granted the motion because Counsel has complied with all necessary requirements, including filing the required forms, serving the parties, and showing that no substantive motion is calendar that would warrant immediate representation.
