And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the County's motion for leave to obtain discovery by mental examination of the Plaintiffs. The County had sought to conduct mental examinations of both Plaintiffs, alleging that there was good cause for such examinations. However, the proposed examiner, April Thames, Ph.D., refused to comply with the statutory requirements for such examinations, specifically the requirement that the examination be recorded. The judge found that the Legislature has spoken clearly on this issue and that the court has no power to disregard the clear command of the statute. The judge also noted that the parties had resolved all issues relating to the mental examinations, except for two: the issue of audio recording of the examinations and the issue of providing raw test data to Plaintiffs' counsel. The judge did not reach the second issue and denied the County's motion.
