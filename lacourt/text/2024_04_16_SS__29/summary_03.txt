And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for terminating sanctions. The defendant had requested terminating sanctions because the plaintiff failed to serve verified responses as ordered and had failed to pay monetary sanctions of $900. The court had previously imposed evidentiary sanctions and ordered the plaintiff to pay monetary sanctions. However, the plaintiff's failure to pay the monetary sanctions did not warrant terminating sanctions. The court also noted that terminating sanctions should be used sparingly and only in extreme cases where less severe sanctions have not been successful. In this case, the defendant's request for terminating sanctions was denied.
