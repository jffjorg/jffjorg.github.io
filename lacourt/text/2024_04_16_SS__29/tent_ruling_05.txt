(Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One) filed by Defendant Jason Fladlien.
 
Tentative
The motion to compel is granted.
The request for sanctions is denied.
Background
These cases all arise out of a motor vehicle
accident on January 1, 2021, near the intersection of Sierra Highway and Golden
Valley Road in Santa Clarita.
In Case No. 22STCV15599, on May 10, 2022,
Plaintiff Gary Trent Stephens filed his complaint against Jason Fladien and
Alexis Woodford. On October 17, 2021, Plaintiff filed an amendment to complaint
adding Molly Fladlien as Doe 1.
In Case No. 22CHCV01468, on December 21, 2022,
Nathan Pratt, a minor by and through his Guardian Ad Litem Andrea Rocha, filed
a complaint against Alexi Jean Woodford, Jason Fladlien, Gary Trent Jong Sou
Stephens, and Nancy Michelle Simon Perez.
In Case No. 22CHCV01484, on December 23, 2022,
Nancy Michelle Simon Perez filed a complaint against Alexis Jean Woodford and
Jason Fladlein.
In Case No. 23CHCV02027, on July 11, 2023, Elsa
Martinez filed her complaint against Alexis J. Woodford and Jason Fladlien.
On September 28, 2023, the cases were
consolidated with 22STCV15599 as the lead case.
As is relevant to this motion, on June 6, 2023, Defendant
Jason Fladlien (“Fladlien”) served Plaintiff Nancy Michelle Simon Perez (“Perez”)
with Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One).  (Wilcoxson Decl., ¶¶ 5-6 & Exhs.
A-B.)  Perez has not served
responses.  (Id., ¶¶ 9-10.)
 
Fladlien filed this motion to compel on March 11.  No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal
Standard
 
A party must respond to interrogatories within 30 days
after service. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.260, subd.(a).) If a party to whom
interrogatories are directed does not provide a timely response, the
propounding party may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories. (Id., § 2030.290, subd. (b).) There is no time limit
for a motion to compel initial responses, and no meet and confer efforts are
required. (See id., § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 411.) Nor
must a separate statement be filed. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
3.1345(b)(1).)  In addition, a party who
fails to provide a timely response generally waives all objections.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd. (a).) 
When a party moves to compel initial responses to
interrogatories, “the court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7
(commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who
unsuccessfully makes or opposes [the motion], unless it finds that the one
subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subd.
(c).)
In Chapter 7
of the Civil Discovery Act, Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.010,
subdivision (d), defines “[m]isuses of the discovery process” to include
“[f]ailing to respond to or to submit to an authorized method of discovery.”  Where a party or attorney has engaged in
misuse of the discovery process, the court may impose a monetary sanction in
the amount of “the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by
anyone as a result of that conduct.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.020, subd. (a).)
Discussion
 
Defendant Fladlien served Plaintiff Perez with form
interrogatories and special interrogatories on June 6, 2023.  (Wilcoxson Decl., ¶¶ 5-6 & Exhs.
A-B.)  Perez has not responded. (Id.,
¶¶ 9-10.)
 
Fladlien
need not show anything more. The motion
to compel is granted.
 
Fladlien’s request for sanctions is DENIED.  
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.290, subdivision (c), authorizes
sanctions only when a party or attorney unsuccessfully makes or opposes a
motion to compel.  Here, Plaintiff did not oppose the
motion.  Defendant also cites Code of Civil Procedure sections
2023.010 and 2023.030, but these sections “do not independently authorize the
trial court to impose monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery.” (City of
Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLC (2022) 84 Cal.App.5th 466, 504.)  (The Court is aware that the California
Supreme Court has granted review of the City of Los Angeles
case.  The order granting review, filed on January 25, 2023, states
that pending review, the appellate opinion “may be cited,” including “for its
persuasive value.”  The Court finds the reasoning of Justice Moor to
be persuasive.)
