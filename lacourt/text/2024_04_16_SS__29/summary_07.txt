And here is the English text summary of the tentative ruling:

The court has denied the defendant's motion for leave to conduct a mental examination of the plaintiff on procedural grounds. The court found that the defendant failed to satisfy the mandatory requirements for a motion for leave to obtain discovery through a mental examination, including specifying the time and manner of the examination, and the diagnostic tests and procedures to be employed. The court also noted that the defendant's proposed examiner would not permit the testing portion of the examination to be recorded, which is prohibited by statute. The court declined to reach the other issues raised by the parties, including whether good cause has been shown and whether the plaintiff has made the required stipulation.
