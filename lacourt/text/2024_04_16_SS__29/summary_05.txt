Here is a summary of the document in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion to compel filed by Defendant Jason Fladlien. The motion is granted, and the judge orders Plaintiff Nancy Michelle Simon Perez to serve verified, code-compliant, written responses to Defendant's Form Interrogatories (Set One) and Special Interrogatories (Set One) within 21 days of notice. The judge also denies Defendant's request for sanctions. The case arises from a motor vehicle accident on January 1, 2021, and involves several related cases that were consolidated. The judge finds that Defendant need not show anything more to support the motion to compel, and that Plaintiff's failure to respond to the interrogatories waived all objections. The judge cites various California statutes and court rules in support of its decision.
