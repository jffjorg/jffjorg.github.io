  Case Number:  21STCV00584    Hearing Date:   April 16, 2024    Dept:  29 Motion for Summary Adjudication filed by Defendant City of Redondo Beach

 
Tentative
 
The Court will hear from counsel.
 
The Court’s tentative ruling is to GRANT City’s motion.
 
Background 
On January 7, 2021, Plaintiff Rosenda Ramirez
Clark (“Plaintiff”) initiated this wrongful death action against Defendants
City of Redondo Beach (“City”), Rodolfo Garcia Muro (“Muro”), Magdalena Garcia
(“Garcia”), Maderos Cocina Mexicana Restaurant (“Restaurant”), Adriatica
International Inc. (“Adriatica”), Jesus Manuel Gonzalez Cornejo (“Cornejo”),
Martha Coronel and Santiago Coronel (collectively, “Coronels”), and Does 1
through 100, asserting the following causes of action: (1) premises liability
against City; (2) premises liability against Muro, Garcia, Restaurant, and
Adriatica; and (3) motor vehicle negligence against Cornejo and  the
Coronels, and two causes of action for premises liability. Plaintiff alleges in
the complaint that on October 8, 2019, Cornejo struck Decedent George Arthur
Clark as he was leaving the parking lot of Maderos Cocina Mexican
Restaurant, which is located at or near 231 S. Pacific Coast Highway in Redondo
Beach.

On June 25, 2021, Muro, Garcia, and Restaurant filed an answer to
the complaint.
On July 9, 2021, Cornejo and the Coronels filed an answer to the
complaint.
On July 22, 2021, City filed an answer to the complaint, as well
as a cross-complaint against Muro, Garcia, Restaurant, Adriatica, the
Cornonels, Cornejo, and Roes 1 through 100.
On August 2, 2201, Adriatica filed an answer to the complaint, as
well as a cross-complaint against Cornejo, Martha Coronel, and Roes 1 through
100.
On May 6, 2022, Plaintiff filed a request for dismissal, with
prejudice, of the claims in the complaint against Muro, Garcia, and Restaurant.
On May 13, 2022, City filed requests for dismissal, without
prejudice, of the claims in its cross-complaint against Muro, Garcia, and Restaurant.
In or about June or July 2023, Plaintiff settled with Adriatica.  On September 20, 2023, the Court granted Adriatica’s
motion for a good faith settlement determination.
On December 28, 2023, Plaintiff filed a request to dismiss, with
prejudice, the claim in the complaint against Adriatica, and Adriatica filed a
request to dismiss, with prejudice, its cross-complaint.
In or about January or February 2024, Plaintiff settled with Cornejo
and the Coronels.  On April 11, 2024, the
Court granted the application of Cornejo and the Coronels for a good faith
settlement determination.
The remaining parties in the suit are Plaintiff and City.
On September 25, 2023, City filed this Motion for Summary Adjudication
of the First Cause of Action, the only cause of action asserted against
City.  City also filed a Request for
Judicial Notice. The motion was noticed for hearing on December 22, 2023.  At the request of Plaintiff, the hearing was
continued to April 3, 2023.  
On March 20, Plaintiff filed her opposition to the motion.  On March 29, City filed its reply, along with
objections to Plaintiff’s evidence.
On the Court’s own motion, the hearing on City’s motion was
continued to April 16.
Legal Standard
“The purpose
of the law of summary judgment is to provide courts with a mechanism to cut
through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite their allegations,
trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic
Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 843.) Code of Civil Procedure section
437c, subdivision (c), “requires the trial judge to grant summary judgment if
all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences reasonably deducible from the
evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences or evidence, show that there
is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp.
(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) “The function of the pleadings in a motion
for summary judgment is to delimit the scope of the issues; the function of the
affidavits or declarations is to disclose whether there is any triable issue of
fact within the issues delimited by the pleadings.” (Juge v. County of
Sacramento (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 59, 67, citing FPI Development, Inc. v.
Nakashima (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 367, 381-382.)
As to each
cause of action as framed by the complaint, a defendant moving for summary
judgment or summary adjudication must satisfy the initial burden of proof by
presenting facts to show “that one or more elements of the cause of action ...
cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to the cause of
action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra,
25 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851; Scalf v. D. B. Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128
Cal.App.4th 1510, 1520.) Once the defendant has met that burden, the burden
shifts to the plaintiff to show that a “triable issue of one or more material
facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 437c, subd. (p)(2); see also Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at pp.
850-851.)
A plaintiff or
cross-complainant moving for summary judgment or summary adjudication must
satisfy the initial burden of proof by presenting facts to show “that there is
no defense to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the
cause of action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action.” (Code
Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (p)(1).) Once the plaintiff or cross-complainant has
met that burden, the burden shift to the defendant or cross-defendant to show
that a “triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to the cause of
action or a defense thereto.” (Ibid.)
The party
opposing a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication may not simply
“rely upon the allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must instead “set
forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists.”
(Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subds. (p)(1) & (p)(2). To establish a triable
issue of material fact, the party opposing the motion must produce substantial
responsive evidence. (Sangster v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.)
Courts
“liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary
judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.” (Dore
v. Arnold Worldwide, Inc. (2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 389.)
Request for Judicial Notice
The Court GRANTS City’s request that the Court take
judicial notice that California State Route 1, Pacific Coast Highway (“PCH”) is
owned by the State of California, even within the city limits of Defendant. 
Evidentiary Objections
City objects to some of Plaintiff’s evidence. Evidence
presented in support of, or in opposition to, a motion for summary judgment
must be admissible. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (d); Perry v. Bakewell Hawthorne LLC (2017) 2 Cal.5th 536, 541-43.) The court
must “consider all of the
evidence set forth in the papers, except the evidence to which objections have
been made and sustained.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).)
The Court SUSTAINS City’s Objection Nos. 12.  Mr. Avrit’s description of the testimony of
other witnesses is hearsay.  The Court
will consider all evidence, including testimony of witnesses, in the summary
judgment record.
The Court SUSTAINS City’s Objection No. 18 in
part.  The first sentence of paragraph 15
of Mr. Avrit’s declaration is not a proper subject of expert testimony.  The second, third, and fourth sentences contain
a description of the testimony of other witnesses, which is hearsay; the Court
will consider all evidence, including testimony of witnesses, in the summary
judgment record.  The Court OVERRULES the
objections to the final two sentences.
The Court OVERRULES City’s other Objections.
The Court recognizes that Mr. Avrit opines that
there was a dangerous condition present at the scene of the accident.  This testimony is not binding on the Court
and does not in itself create a disputed issue of material fact on a motion for
summary judgment.  “The fact that a witness can be found to opine that … a condition
constitutes a significant risk and a dangerous condition does not eliminate
this court’s statutory task pursuant to Government Code section 830.2, of
independently evaluating the circumstances.” 
(Thimon v. City of Newark (2020) 44 Cal.App.5th 745, 755; accord Sun
v. City of Oakland (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 1177, 1189; Davis v. City of
Pasadena (1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 701, 705.) 
But expert opinion may be admissible, relevant, and helpful to the
Court, even if it is not determinative.  The Court will consider all of the
admissible evidence (including the expert opinion evidence as to which no
objection is sustained) in conducting its independent obligation (in which
expert opinion evidence is not determinative) to evaluate whether the existence
of a dangerous condition may be resolved on this record as a matter of law.  
Discussion
The facts regarding the accident are largely not in
dispute, at least for purposes of this motion for summary adjudication.
Pacific Coast Highway (“PCH”) is, at the scene of the
accident, owned and controlled by the State of California.  (Defendant’s Statement of Undisputed Material
Facts [“DSUMF”], No. 1.)  At the scene of
the accident, PCH runs north-south. 
(DSUMF, No. 2.)
On October 8, 2019, in the late morning, Jesus Manuel
Gonzalez Cornejo (“Cornejo”) was driving southbound on PCH and pulled into the
parking lot of Maderos Restaurant. 
(DSUMF, Nos. 3-4.)  Cornejo saw
that the restaurant was closed and decided to exit the parking lot through the
same driveway that he had used to enter the parking lot.  (DSUMF, No. 4.)
As Cornejo
attempted to exit the parking lot and resume traveling on PCH, he brought his
pick up truck to a complete stop.  (Cornejo
Deposition Transcript [“Cornejo Depo.”], at 44:1-6.)  (Excerpts from the transcript of Cornejo’s
deposition are attached as Exhibit 1 to the declaration of Kenton E. Moore, filed
with the moving papers, and as Exhibit C to the declaration of Daniel M.
Graham, filed with the opposition papers.)  The front tires, he testified, were “right where
the sidewalk is,” “[e]xactly at … the sidewalk.”  (Id., at 44:7-11, 44:19-22; see also
Depo. Exh. 2.)  Cornejo’s truck was “obstructing
the sidewalk,” “across the sidewalk.” (Id., at 119:15-23, 208:6-12,
209:5-14.)
Before Cornejo
brought his truck to a complete stop on the sidewalk, he looked both to his
left and to his right.  (Id., at 48:20-49:4,
52:8-11.)  Cornejo testified that at this
time, before he came to a stop, he could see “the whole street” when he looked
to his right and to his left.  (Id.,
at 49:10-24.)  He then clarified that when
he said “the whole street,” he was referring to the sidewalk.  (Id., at 49:25-50:5.)  He stated that he could see “the whole sidewalk”
and nothing was blocking his view.  (Id.,
at 53:24-55:4.)  Cornejo did not see any
pedestrians.  (Id., at 49:5-9, 50:6-8,
52:12-15, 54:10-12, 54:21-24.)
Because of the
traffic on PCH, Cornejo was stopped on the sidewalk there for approximately 30
seconds, waiting for a break in the traffic (Id., at 47:18-20, 48:12-19,
50:13-15, 117:20-118:6.)  While he was
stopped, he looked both to his left and to his right and did not see any
pedestrians.  (Id., at 47:24-48:7,
50:19-21, 57:1-9, 57:17-22.)  Cornejo was
focusing more to his left “to watch the cars that were coming down the road.”  (Id., at 55:5-15, 57:10-16,
208:21-209:3.)
A car on PCH that
was stopped waved to Cornejo to allow him to exit on to PCH.  (Id., at 57:23-58:1.)  Cornejo lifted his foot off the brake and
rolled forward.  (DSUMF, No. 13.)  Cornejo then felt a pedestrian’s hands on the
hood of his pickup truck.  (DSUMF, No.
13.)  Cornejo first saw the pedestrian
when his hands were on the hood of his truck. 
(DSUMF, No. 14.)
The pedestrian the
Cornejo hit with his truck was George Arthur Clark, Plaintiff’s husband.  Plaintiff alleges that Mr. Clark died approximately
seven months later from the injuries he sustained in the accident.
The only cause of action in the complaint asserted
against City is the first cause of action, asserting a claim for a dangerous
condition of public property under Government Code section 835.  City moves for summary adjudication of the
first cause of action on four independent grounds: (1) that the cause of action
for a dangerous condition of public property fails as a matter of law because
the accident occurred on property that was neither owned nor controlled by
City; (2) that the condition of the sidewalk was, as a matter of law, not
dangerous; (3) that any dangerous condition of the sidewalk was, as a matter of
law, minor, trivial, or insignificant; and (4) that to the extent that
Plaintiff seeks to impose liability on City for issuing building permits, Government
Code sections 818.4 and 821.2 provide immunity to City.
As set forth in Government Code section 835, there
are four elements for a claim against a public entity for a dangerous
condition on public property: 
“[A] public entity is
liable for injury caused by a dangerous condition of its property if the
plaintiff establishes [1] that the property was in a dangerous condition at the
time of the injury, [2] that the injury was proximately caused by the dangerous
condition, [3] that the dangerous condition created a reasonably foreseeable
risk of the kind of injury which was incurred, and [4] either: (a) A
negligent or wrongful act or omission of an employee of the public entity
within the scope of his employment created the dangerous condition; or¿(b) The
public entity had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition
under Section 835.2 a sufficient time prior to the injury to have taken
measures to protect against the dangerous condition.”
(Gov’t
Code, § 835; see also, e.g., Tansavatdi v. City of
Rancho Palos Verdes (2023) 14 Cal.5th 639, 653; Thimon v. City of Newark (2020) 44
Cal.App.5th 745, 753.)  
City First
Argument: It Did Not Own or Control the Property at Issue
“A public
entity is liable for dangerous conditions on property it owns but not for
dangerous conditions on private property.” 
(Huffman v. City of Poway (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 975, 988.)  “[T]he public property upon which liability
is based must be owned or controlled by the public entity at the time of the
injury.”  (Longfellow v. County of San
Luis Obispo (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 379, 383.)  “A defendant cannot be held
liable for the defective or dangerous condition of property which it did not
own, possess, or control. Where the absence of ownership, possession, or
control has been unequivocally established, summary judgment is proper.” (Isaacs
v. Huntington Memorial Hospital (1985) 38 Cal.3d 112, 134.)
Here, the undisputed evidence establishes
that City did not own or control the property on which the accident
occurred.  (DSUMF, No. 1.)  The State of California owns and controls
PCH, and the restaurant parking lot is private property.  (Ibid.) 

In response, Plaintiff argues that because
the private commercial property is located within the City’s geographical boundaries,
City has jurisdiction, supervision, and control over the property.  Under Plaintiff’s theory, a municipality
could be held liable for any dangerous condition located on private property within
its borders, simply because the property was in violation of a municipal code
provision (here, the nuisance ordinance). 
Plaintiff cites no authority for such a
proposition, and the Court is aware of none. 
Absent evidence of ownership or control, City cannot be held liable under
Government Code section 835, for a dangerous condition of public property, when
the accident occurred on property owned and controlled by a private entity or a
different public entity.
City’s Second and Third Arguments: There Was,
at Most, a Trivial Defect, not a Dangerous Condition
Government Code section
830, subdivision (a), defines the term “dangerous condition” to mean “a condition
of property that creates a substantial (as distinguished from a
minor,¿trivial¿or insignificant) risk of injury when such property or adjacent
property is used with due care in a manner in which it is reasonably
foreseeable that it¿will be used.”¿(See also Thimon, supra, 44
Cal.App.5th at p. 754.)¿ 
Plaintiff has the burden of proving the existence of a dangerous
condition and each element of a cause of action under Government Code 835. A
court may not presume that there was a dangerous condition merely because the
plaintiff was injured. (Sambrano v. City of San Diego (2001) 94
Cal.App.4th 225, 241 [describing such an argument as “reason[ing] backwards”].)
“A condition is not
dangerous within the meaning of the statute unless it creates a hazard to those
who foreseeably will use the property ... with due care. Thus, even though
it is foreseeable that persons may use public property without due care, a
public entity may not be held liable for failing to take precautions to protect
such persons.”¿(Matthews v. City of Cerritos¿(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1380,
1384.) “The condition of the property involved should create a
‘substantial risk’ of injury, for an undue burden would be placed upon public
entities if they were responsible for the repair of all conditions creating any
possibility of injury however remote that possibility might be.”¿(Fredette¿v.
City of Long Beach¿(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 122, 130, fn.5.) 
Government Code section 830.2 provides that a condition is not a
“dangerous condition” under the Government Claims Act “if the trial or
appellate court, viewing the evidence most favorably to the plaintiff,
determines as a matter of law that the risk created by the condition was of
such a minor, trivial or insignificant nature in view of the surrounding
circumstances that no reasonable person would conclude that the condition
created a substantial risk of injury when such property or adjacent property was
used with due care in a manner in which it was reasonably foreseeable that it
would be used.” This statutory principle is sometimes referred to as “the
trivial defect doctrine.”  “The trivial defect doctrine is not an
affirmative defense. It is an aspect of duty that a plaintiff must plead and
prove.” (Huckey v. City of Temecula (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th
1092, 1104.)   
“The existence of a
dangerous condition ordinarily is a question of fact, but the issue may be
resolved as a matter of law if reasonable minds can come to only one conclusion.”
(Peterson v. San Francisco Comm. College Dist.¿(1984) 36 Cal.3d 799,
810; accord Stack v. City of Lemoore (2023) 91 Cal.App.5th 102, 110.) 
“In appropriate cases, the
trial court may determine ... whether a given … defect was trivial as a
matter of law.” (Huckey, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p. 1104.) “‘Where
reasonable minds can reach only one conclusion—that there was no
substantial risk of injury—the issue is a question of law, properly resolved by
way of summary judgment.’” (Id. at pp. 1104-1105 (quoting Caloroso v.
Hathaway (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 922, 929).) “If, however,
the court determines that sufficient evidence has been presented so that
reasonable minds may differ as to whether the defect presents a substantial
risk of injury, the court may not conclude that the defect is trivial as a matter
of law.” (Huckey, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p. 1105.)  
Plaintiff’s theory of liability in this matter is that the driveway
leading to PCH was dangerous because visibility was obstructed by frontage
extensions adjacent to the public sidewalk running along PCH.  (Complaint, p. 5.)  But the driver of the truck that hit Mr.
Clark testified that even before he brought his truck to a stop at the
intersection of the driveway and the sidewalk, he could see “the whole sidewalk”
and nothing was blocking his view. 
(Cornejo Depo., at 49:10-50:5, 53:24-55:4.)  The
expert testimony submitted by Plaintiff cannot create a disputed issue here where
there otherwise is none: nothing was blocking Cornejo’s view before or at the
time of the accident.
The
Court recognizes, of course, that at least in a non-legal sense, there is
danger associated with any driveway that fronts on PCH or any other busy street
or highway.  A driver who is focusing on
the vehicle traffic (usually to the driver’s left) may fail to exercise due
care and drive into or across a sidewalk that is occupied by a pedestrian
(often coming from the driver’s right).  But
that alone does not make every such driveway a dangerous condition within the
meaning of Government Code section 830, particularly as limited by section 830.2.
City’s Fourth Argument: Immunity Under Sections 818.4 and 821.2
for Issuing Building Permits
To
the extent that Plaintiff is attempting to impose liability on City for its
decision to issue building permits that (Plaintiff contends) blocked visibility
for drivers exiting the commercial driveway and entering PCH at the scene of
the accident, Government Code sections 818.4 and 821.2 provide the City with
immunity.
As
the California Supreme Court reemphasized, design immunity under the Government
Code immunity does not necessarily protect a public entity City against failure
to warn claims – although such claims may be subject to signage immunity under
Government Code section 830.8.  (Tansavatdi
v. City of Rancho Palos Verdes (2023) 14 Cal.5th 639, 659-662, 668.)  Plaintiff argues, by analogy, that the City’s
immunity here does not extend to failure to warn claims.
But Plaintiff has not shown, on this record, what dangerous condition the
City created or had knowledge of that should have been the subject of a
warning.  Plaintiff has not shown, and cannot
show, that (for example) City has an obligation to place a “look both ways” warning
sign facing drivers at every driveway within its boundaries that fronts on a
busy street.
In sum,
the Court has considered all of the evidence in the record and all of the argument
presented by both sides.  On this record,
City has met its burden of showing that it is entitled to summary adjudication
as a matter of law.  On Plaintiff’s first
cause of action, one or more elements of the cause of action cannot be established and
there is a complete defense to the cause of action.  There are no triable issues of material facts
as to the elements of the cause of action or defense. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c,
subd. (p)(2).)
Accordingly,
City’s motion for summary adjudication is granted.
Conclusion
The Court GRANTS
City’s motion for summary adjudication as to the first cause of action in the
complaint.
Moving
party to give notice.
