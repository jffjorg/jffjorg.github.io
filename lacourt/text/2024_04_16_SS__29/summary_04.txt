And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion to consolidate the two cases, Case Nos. 21STCV47187 and 21STCV47478, without prejudice on procedural grounds. The defendant's motion was filed on May 3, 2023, but it did not comply with the mandatory requirements of California Rules of Court, Rule 3.350. Specifically, the notice of motion did not list all named parties in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names of their respective attorneys of record, and it was not filed in the Weingarten Action. Therefore, the judge has denied the motion without prejudice, allowing the defendant to re-file the motion in compliance with the procedural requirements.
