 Case Number:  21STCV47187    Hearing Date:   April 16, 2024    Dept:  29 Defendant’s Motion to Consolidate 
 
Tentative
 
The motion is denied without prejudice on procedural
grounds.
 
Background
Two related cases arise out of a motor vehicle
accident on January 3, 2020, on the 10 Freeway in Santa Monica.
In this case, Case No. 21STCV47187, Plaintiffs
Margarita Marquez, Maria Marquez, and Primitiva Estrada (collectively, the
“Marquez Plaintiffs”) filed their complaint on December 28, 2021, asserting one
cause of action for negligence against Jason Adam Overlander and Does 1 through
50 (the “Marquez Action”).   
In the other case, Case No. 21STCV47478,
Plaintiffs Jennie Journo Weingarten and Lishai Weingarten (collectively, the
“Weingarten Plaintiffs”) filed their complaint on December 30, 2021, asserting
causes of action for motor vehicle negligence and general negligence against
Jason Adam Oberlander, Margarita Marquez, and Does 1 through 50 (the
“Weingarten Action”).
Defendant Jason Adam Oberlander (erroneously
named as Jason Adam Overlander in this case) (“Defendant”) filed his answers to
the two complaints on July 27, 2022.
On November 2, 2022, the Marquez Action and the
Weingarten Action were related.  
On June 27, 2023, the Weingarten Plaintiffs
filed a request to dismiss, without prejudice, their claims against
Margarita Marquez.
The trial date in each of the two cases is
currently set for July 24, 2024.
Defendant filed this motion to consolidate the two
matters on May 3, 2023. No opposition has been filed.
 
Legal Standard
 
“When
actions involving a common question of law or fact are pending before the
court, it may order a joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue
in the actions; it may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such
orders concerning proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or
delay.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd.
(a).)
 
The
trial court should not consolidate actions where prejudice would result any
party, e.g., when consolidation would cause a litigant to need to adopt adverse
litigations positions in a single trial. 
(See State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1956) 47 Cal.2d
428, 430.)
 
California
Rules of Court, rule 3.350, sets forth certain mandatory procedural
requirements for a motion to consolidate. 
The rule states:
 
“(a)
Requirements of motion
(1)  A notice of
motion to consolidate must:
(A)  List all named
parties in each case, the names of those who have appeared, and the names of
their respective attorneys of record;
(B)  Contain the
captions of all the cases sought to be consolidated, with the lowest numbered
case shown first; and
(C)  Be filed in
each case sought to be consolidated.
 
(2)  The motion to
consolidate:
(A)  Is deemed a
single motion for the purpose of determining the appropriate filing fee, but
memorandums, declarations, and other supporting papers must be filed only in
the lowest numbered case; 
(B)  Must be served
on all attorneys of record and all nonrepresented parties in all of the cases
sought to be consolidated; and
(C)  Must have a
proof of service filed as part of the motion.”
 
Discussion
 
On May
3, 2023, Defendant filed this motion in the Marquez Action.  He did not at that time, or since, file the
notice of motion in the Weingarten Action. 
This is a mandatory requirement. 
(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.350(a)(1)(C).)  
 
The notice
of motion also does not list all named parties in each case, the names of those
who have appeared, and the names of their respective attorneys of record.  This is also a mandatory requirement.  (Id., rule 3.350(a)(1)(A).)
 
Accordingly, the Court must deny the
motion to consolidate, without prejudice, on procedural grounds.
 
Conclusion
 
The Court DENIES the motion to
consolidate Case Nos. 21STCV47187 and 21STCV47478, without prejudice, on
procedural grounds.
 
Moving Party to give notice.
