And here is the summary in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on a motion for leave to file a First Amended Complaint by Plaintiff Christina Bell against Defendant Kia Motors America, Inc. The Plaintiff seeks to add a cause of action for fraudulent inducement and request punitive damages. The Defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the Plaintiff has not identified when the facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered and that the amendment would be unduly prejudicial.

The judge grants the motion, finding that leave to amend should generally only be denied when the amendment is both dilatory and unduly prejudicial, and that there is little evidence that the amendments would cause undue prejudice to the Defendant. The judge notes that the "better course of action" is to permit the amendment and then let the parties test its legal sufficiency in other appropriate proceedings. The judge also cites various California court cases in support of the ruling.

The tentative ruling states that the Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File a First Amended Complaint is GRANTED, and that a stand-alone FAC must be filed and served to all current parties within 10 days. Any new parties must be served in a timely manner as provided by law. The Defendant is then free to attack the FAC by demurrer, motion to strike, etc. as may be warranted under the law.
