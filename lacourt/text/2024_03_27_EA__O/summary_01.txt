And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the plaintiff's motion to quash deposition subpoenas for medical records. The plaintiff, JORGE LOYOLA, alleges that he was abused and neglected by the defendants, POSITIVE BEHAVIOR STEPS CORPORATION, SAN GABRIEL POMONA REGIONAL CENTER, and MICHAEL PENGSON PEDROSA. The defendants had issued subpoenas for the plaintiff's medical records, but the plaintiff objected, citing concerns about his right to privacy.

The judge notes that the defendants appear to be amenable to limiting the scope of the subpoenas and placing a protective order. Therefore, the motion is moot, and no monetary sanctions are imposed. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has not advanced an argument that he has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his medical records, given that his injuries are the basis of the lawsuit.

The judge's ruling is based on the case law, including the California Supreme Court's decision in Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, which sets forth a three-pronged test for determining whether a party has a right against discovery. The judge applies this test and finds that the plaintiff has not met his burden of showing that he has a reasonable expectation of privacy in his medical records.
