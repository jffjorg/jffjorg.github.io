And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the settlement between the plaintiffs and defendants is in good faith. The settlement involves a confidential sum that takes into account a waiver of over $23,000 in back rent. The defendants believe that liability would have been attributed primarily to Temeku, and the plaintiffs presented limited evidence to support their claim for damages. The judge finds that there is no evidence of collusion or fraud in the settlement and grants the application for determination of good faith settlement. As a result, any other joint tortfeasor or co-obligor is barred from asserting further claims against Parallax Properties LLC or Xenon Investment Corp. for equitable comparative contribution or partial or comparative indemnity based on comparative negligence or comparative fault.
