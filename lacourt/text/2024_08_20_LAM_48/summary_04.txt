And here is a summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motions to strike filed by Loss Prevention Services, LLC (LPS), Toyota Motor Credit Corporation (Toyota), and Nations Recovery Services Inc. (NRS). The motions seek to strike various allegations made by the plaintiff, Eva Bernece Melendez Velasco, regarding the defendants' alleged unlicensed repossession activities and grand theft.

The Judge found that the allegations of unlicensed repossession activities and grand theft are relevant to the case and support the plaintiff's claims. The defendants' arguments that the allegations are improper and unfounded were found to be based on the merits of the allegations, rather than the sufficiency of the pleadings.

The Judge also denied the defendants' motions to strike the allegations of punitive damages, finding that the plaintiff has alleged facts that could support a finding of malice or oppression.

The Judge concluded that the motions to strike are denied, and the parties are required to submit on the tentative ruling.
