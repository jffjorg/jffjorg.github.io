Summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by Judge Thomas D. Long in the case of Hooman Melamed, M.D., Inc. and Paul Dwan, M.D., Inc. v. Centinela Valley IPA. The case is about a dispute over whether Centinela Valley IPA owes payment to the plaintiffs for emergency services provided to Patient CB. The plaintiffs allege that Patient CB was insured by Centinela Valley IPA and that the company failed to resolve a billing dispute with the plaintiffs. Centinela Valley IPA argues that it is not a healthcare service plan and does not owe payment to the plaintiffs.

The court has granted Centinela Valley IPA's motion for summary judgment, ruling that the company does not owe payment to the plaintiffs. The court found that Centinela Valley IPA is not a healthcare service plan and does not have patient enrollees or members. The court also found that the company did not request the plaintiffs to provide emergency services to Patient CB and that any emergency services provided did not benefit Centinela Valley IPA.

The court has scheduled a hearing for August 28, 2024 to review the proposed judgment. The court has also denied the plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend the first amended complaint and has scheduled a hearing for September 5, 2024 to hear the motion.
