And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Defendant TPG Pressure, Inc.'s motion to stay proceedings pending the resolution of the Federal Maritime Commission's decision is GRANTED. The court finds that a stay is appropriate in this instance and will accommodate the ends of justice. The court notes that the Federal Maritime Commission's deadline for decision is July 29, 2024, only three months away, and that a short stay and possible trial continuance will not cause prejudice to the Plaintiff, Epic Freight Solutions LLC. The court finds that the Federal Maritime Commission has primary jurisdiction over the dispute and that a stay of the proceedings is in the interest of justice.
