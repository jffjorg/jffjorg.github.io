And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court rules on the demurrer filed by Cross-Defendant Natalie Ann Johnson to the First Amended Cross-Complaint (FACC) filed by the Cross-Complainants. The court finds that the FACC contains sufficient allegations to state a cause of action for breach of contract, promissory fraud, and violations of Business and Professions Code sections 17200 and 7031. The court also finds that the FACC contains sufficient allegations to state a cause of action for quantum meruit. The court denies Johnson's demurrer and overrules it. The court orders that Johnson file proof of service and give notice to the parties.
