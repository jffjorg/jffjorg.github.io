**Tentative Ruling**

Case No.: 22STCV10077

Hearing Date: April 23, 2024

**Plaintiff:** Kristina Holman

**Defendants:** Kerlan-Jobe Surgery Center, LLC, et al.

**Background:** The Plaintiff, Kristina Holman, filed a complaint against the Defendants alleging various employment-related claims. The Plaintiff has filed a motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents.

**Legal Standard:** California Code of Civil Procedure Section 2031.310 provides that a party may move to compel further responses to a request for production of documents if the party deems that any of the following apply: (1) a statement of compliance with the demand is incomplete; (2) a representation of inability to comply is inadequate, incomplete, or evasive; or (3) an objection in the response is without merit or too general.

**Discussion:** The Plaintiff has moved to compel further responses to requests for production of documents, specifically requests 209-234. The Defendants have objected to these requests on various grounds, including vagueness, ambiguity, and relevance to the claims at issue.

**Ruling:** After reviewing the requests and the objections thereto, the Court finds that the objections to requests 209-234 are without merit. The Court finds that the requests are not vague or ambiguous and are relevant to the claims at issue. The Court also finds that the objections to requests 216, 218, 220, 221, and 222 are without merit and that the requests are relevant to the claims at issue.

**Order:** The Court hereby orders that the Defendants shall produce all documents within their possession, custody, or control responsive to requests 209-234, 216, 218, 220, 221, and 222. The Court also orders that the Defendants shall produce all documents within their possession, custody, or control responsive to requests 225, 231, and 232.

**Conclusion:** The Court finds that the Plaintiff has adequately met and conferred with the Defendants and that the requests for production of documents are relevant to the claims at issue. The Court hereby grants the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses to requests for production of documents.

**Next Steps:** The parties shall confer and file a joint statement indicating whether they have reached an agreement on the production of documents. If an agreement is not reached, the parties shall appear at the next hearing date to discuss any outstanding issues.

**Date:** April 23, 2024
