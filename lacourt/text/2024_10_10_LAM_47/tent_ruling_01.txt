STATEMENT
OF MATERIAL FACTS AND/OR PROCEEDINGS:
            
            This is a collection action that was filed on October 3, 2023. Plaintiff
alleges that Defendant has defaulted on a loan agreement executed by Plaintiff’s
assignor. 
 
Plaintiff moves to transfer venue
to Orange County. 
            
TENTATIVE RULING:
 
Plaintiff moves to transfer venue
to Orange County pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 397.
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 397 grants
the Court discretionary authority to change the place of trial in certain
cases, including, as relevant here “[w]hen the court
designated in the complaint is not the proper court.” (Code Civ. Proc. §
397(a).)  
 
On determining the proper court in which
to file an action, Code of Civil Procedure section 395(a) provides: 
 
(a)¿Except as otherwise provided by law
and subject to the power of the court to transfer actions or proceedings as
provided in this title, the superior court in the county where the
defendants or some of them reside at the commencement of the action is the
proper court for the trial of the action. If the action is for injury to person
or personal property or for death from wrongful act or negligence, the superior
court in either the county where the injury occurs or the injury causing
death occurs or the county where the defendants, or some of them reside
at the commencement of the action, is a proper court for the trial of the
action. . . . Subject to subdivision (b), if a defendant has contracted to
perform an obligation in a particular county, the superior court in the county
where the obligation is to be performed, where the contract in fact was entered
into, or where the defendant or any defendant resides at the commencement of
the action is a proper court for the trial of an action founded on that obligation,
and the county where the obligation is incurred is the county where it is to be
performed, unless there is a special contract in writing to the contrary. . .
. 
 
(Code Civ. Proc. § 395(a) (bold emphasis added).)
 
Plaintiff requests that the Court
exercise its discretionary authority to transfer this action to Orange County
on the grounds that Defendant resides in Aliso Viejo, in Orange County, rather
than in Los Angeles. (Declaration of Gloria Zarco ISO Mot. ¶¶ 3-4.) It is not
entirely clear from the papers why Plaintiff has sought to transfer this action
rather than simply dismissing the action and re-filing in Orange County.
However, Plaintiff’s choice of venue is presumptively correct. (E.g., Pesses
v. Superior Court (1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 117, 124.) Therefore, based on
Plaintiff’s affirmative and express representations that the proper venue is
Orange County rather than Los Angeles, the Court will exercise its authority to
order this action transferred. 
 
Accordingly, Plaintiff’s Motion to
Transfer Venue to Orange County is GRANTED.
 
Moving Party to give notice.
 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

            Any party may submit on the
tentative ruling by contacting the courtroom via email at Smcdept47@lacourt.org by no later than 4:00 p.m. the day
before the hearing. All interested parties must be copied on the email. It
should be noted that if you submit on a tentative ruling the court will still
conduct a hearing if any party appears. By submitting on the tentative you
have, in essence, waived your right to be present at the hearing, and you
should be aware that the court may not adopt the tentative, and may issue an
order which modifies the tentative ruling in whole or in part.
