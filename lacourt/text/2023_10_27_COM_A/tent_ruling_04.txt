QUIET
TITLE ACTION – HEARING REQUIRED
 
[TENTATIVE] ORDER GRANTING
REQUEST
 FOR COURT JUDGMENT
I.       
BACKGROUND
      The
complaint alleges claims for quiet title, cancellation of instruments,
declaratory relief, and equitable subrogation/equitable lien. Plaintiff seeks a
judgment by default against Defendants, Peleclare L. Arp and the City of
Lynwood, whose defaults were entered on May 8, 2023. Default was entered
against Defendant, Elenoa Tufuga, on May 23, 2023.
      Plaintiff
seeks judgment (1) to quiet title in its favor and a declaration that it has an
enforceable lien of $240,000 secured by a deed of trust; (2) to quiet title
that Defendants have no right, title, lien or interest in the property adverse
to plaintiff’s; (3) cancel the March 2, 2021 deed securing a debt owed to City
of Lynwood which was paid off, but no reconveyance recorded; (4) and for a
declaration that Plaintiff holds a valid and enforceable priority deed of trust
on the entire property as of July 20, 2022, and holds a senior lien priority
position.
II.     
LEGAL STANDARDS
      Upon
entry of default against a defendant, the plaintiff may apply to the court for
the relief demanded in the complaint. The court shall hear the evidence offered
by the plaintiff and render judgment in the plaintiff's favor for that relief,
not exceeding the amount stated in the complaint. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585 (b).) 
      Before
entering judgment on a quiet title claim by default, the court “shall examine
into and determine the plaintiff's title against the claims of all the
defendants. … [The court] “shall in all cases require evidence of plaintiff's
title and hear such evidence as may be offered respecting the claims of any of
the defendants, other than claims the validity of which is admitted by the
plaintiff in the complaint. The court shall render judgment in accordance with
the evidence and the law." (Code Civ. Proc., § 764.010.) A quiet title action determines the
adverse claims to the title of the Plaintiff against which determination is
sought. (Orcilla v. Big Sur, Inc.) (2016) 244
Cal.App.4th 982, 1010.)

  (Substitution of Trustee and Full Reconveyance.)


F



 
Plaintiff did not record the last deed of trust for
the $240K refinance and has not been able to locate the original. However,
Plaintiff has the promissory note signed by Tufuga for $240K. (Decl of Cedric
Bankson, Ex. 1.)  Plaintiff has the
unrecorded deed of trust securing the note. Bankson Decl, Ex. 2.)
      There
is evidence that a part of the $240K loan funded by Plaintiff was used to pay
off the City of Lynwood loan, but a full reconveyance was never recorded. A
Disbursement Summary Report dated 7/20/22 shows a disbursement from the PHH
loan to City of Lynwood for $58,825.00. (Bankson Decl, Ex. 3.)
      Plaintiff
seeks cancellation of the Lynwood deed of trust as of July 20, 2022, as it
clouds title to the property. Plaintiff asks for a declaration that Plaintiff’s
deed of trust for $240K is valid and enforceable as of July 2022, it is senior
to all encumbrances, and Defendants have no interest therein. 
Defendants, Elenoa Tufuga (homeowner) and
Peleclare L. Arp.
      Among
the elements Plaintiff must establish in a claim for quiet title are the
adverse claims of the Defendants as against the Plaintiff. (Code Civ. Proc.,
761.020). The complaint alleges that Tufuga is the homeowner, and that she
signed the $240,000 promissory note funded by Plaintiff by and signed by her
attorney in fact, Peleclare L. Arp. The facts do not demonstrate how Tufuga’s
interest in the property is adverse to Plaintiff’s. Her property was used to
secure the loan owing to Plaintiff. The facts and evidence do not establish
that Arp has any ownership interest in the real property to be quieted. 
      Defaulting defendants confess the material facts
alleged. Defendants’ failure to answer admits all matters well pleaded in the
complaint. (Kim v. Westmoore
Partners, Inc. (2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 267, 281 ["the defendant's failure
to answer has the same effect as an express admission of the matters
well pleaded in the complaint.” [italics in original].
      The
facts do not establish why Tufuga’s and Arp’s interests (assuming Arp has one,
which is not proved) are adverse to Plaintiff. Plaintiff seeks cancellation of
the City of Lynwood debt as it remains a cloud on title and hampers Plaintiff’s
ability to sell the real property. 
IV.   
CONCLUSION
      Based
on the foregoing, and subject to a hearing and examination of all the evidence,
the Court is inclined to grant the Request for Court Judgment against Defendant,
City of Lynwood, plus costs of $1,137.41 for filing fees and service of
process. Plaintiff has not established why it is entitled judgment against
Tufuga or Arp.
