CONTINUING
 THE HEARING ON PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME
 
            The court has
considered the Petition filed on June 28,
 2023 by Oscar Ricardo Madrigal to change name to Oscar
 Pablo Cueva, to replace his biological father’s name to that of his father
 figure. The Criminal History Assessment filed on August 22, 2023,
reveals no known arrest record. 
            On August 29,
2023, the Court continued the hearing to permit Petitioner to comply with the
requirements for publication of the Order to Show Cause. (Code Civ. Proc., §
1277.) The Court’s electronic file does not reflect that proof of publication
has been filed.
            Accordingly, the
Court continues the hearing to  December 7, 2023,  at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton
Court house. Petitioner is ordered to file proof of publication of the Order to
Show Cause 10 court days before the hearing.
