And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The City of Carson is seeking summary judgment or summary adjudication against James H. Cloudman, the owner of the real property at issue, due to the creation of a nuisance per se. The City has alleged that Cloudman failed to remedy the conditions on the property, which violated various municipal codes and were injurious to the health of the occupants and the community.

The material facts are not in dispute, and the City has established that the conditions on the property were a nuisance per se. The City has also shown that it issued warnings and notices of violations to Cloudman, but he refused to comply with the violations. The violations were eventually abated, and the City incurred costs and fees associated with the abatement.

The Court finds that the City has met its burden of showing that there is no defense to the cause of action, and the burden shifts to Cloudman to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists. However, since all material facts are not in dispute, the Court GRANTS the City's Motion for Summary Judgment against Cloudman.
