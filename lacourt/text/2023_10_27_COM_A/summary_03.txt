And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling continuing the hearing on a petition for a name change filed by Oscar Ricardo Madrigal. Madrigal seeks to change his name to Oscar Pablo Cueva, replacing his biological father's name with that of his father figure. The Court has considered the petition and a criminal history assessment, which revealed no known arrest record. The Court previously continued the hearing to permit Madrigal to comply with the requirements for publishing an Order to Show Cause. However, the Court's electronic file does not reflect that proof of publication has been filed. Therefore, the Court continues the hearing to December 7, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the Compton Court house, and orders Madrigal to file proof of publication 10 court days before the hearing.
