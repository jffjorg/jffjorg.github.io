And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Defendant Jupiter to the complaint filed by Plaintiff 300 West Artesia, L.P. The demurrer was filed on June 20, 2023, and was originally set for hearing on August 10, 2023. The hearing was continued to October 11, 2023, and then again to October 20, 2023.

The judge has found that the demurrer is meritless and has overruled it. The judge has also found that the four causes of action alleged in the complaint are not contradictory and do not render the complaint uncertain. The judge has assumed the truth of the properly pleaded factual allegations and has considered the contentions, deductions, and conclusions of fact and law presented by the parties.

The judge has ordered Defendant Jupiter to file an answer within five days. The judge has also noted that the filing of a Chapter 7 Petition for Bankruptcy by Defendant B&O does not affect Plaintiff's ability to continue the action against Defendant Jupiter.
