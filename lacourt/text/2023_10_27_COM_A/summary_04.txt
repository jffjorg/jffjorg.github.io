Summary:

The judge's tentative ruling grants the plaintiff's request for a court judgment against the City of Lynwood, but is inclined to deny the request against the defendants Elenoa Tufuga and Peleclare L. Arp. The plaintiff seeks to quiet title, cancel instruments, and obtain declaratory relief and equitable subrogation/equitable lien. The plaintiff alleges that Tufuga is the homeowner and signed a promissory note for $240,000, and that Arp is Tufuga's attorney in fact. The judge finds that the plaintiff has not established why Tufuga's and Arp's interests are adverse to the plaintiff's, and that the plaintiff's claims against Tufuga and Arp are not supported by the evidence. The judge also finds that the plaintiff has not established why it is entitled to judgment against Tufuga or Arp.
