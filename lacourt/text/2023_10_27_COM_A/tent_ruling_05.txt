[TENTATIVE]
ORDER OVERRULING DEMURRER BY DEFENDANT, JUPITER WAREHOUSE AND DISTRIBUTION,
INC., TO PLAINTIFF’S COMPLAINT
 
I.       
BACKGROUND
      The
complaint for unlawful detainer arises from the breach of a 2019 written commercial
lease agreement for a five-year term between Plaintiff, lessor, and Defendants,
B&O Express (“B&O”) and Jupiter Warehouse and Distribution (“Jupiter”).
Plaintiff served a three-day notice to pay rent or quit. Plaintiff alleges
Defendants remain in possession. The clerk entered default against B&O on
July 20, 2023.
      On
June 20, 2023, Defendant Jupiter filed a demurrer to Plaintiff’s complaint
originally set for hearing on August 10, 2023. On August 9, 2023, Plaintiff
filed a notice of Defendant B&O’s filing of a Chapter 7 Petition for
Bankruptcy. The Court continued the hearing to permit the parties to brief the
effect of B&O’s bankruptcy filing. The parties stipulated to continue the briefing
schedule and hearing to October 11, 2023, as Plaintiff anticipated filing a
motion with the bankruptcy court for relief from the automatic stay. 
      As
of October 9, 2023, the parties have not filed any briefs regarding the effect
of B&O’s bankruptcy filing. On October 11, 2023, the Court again continued
the hearing. On October 20, 2023, Plaintiff filed notice that the Bankruptcy
Court terminated the automatic stay in connection with Defendant, B&O
Express Inc.’s bankruptcy filing.
 
II.      ARGUMENTS
      Defendant
Jupiter demurs to all four causes of action for failure to state a claim, on
grounds the notices to pay rent or quit supporting each cause of action are
contradictory. Plaintiff argues that the complaint is well pled and not based
on contradictory notices. In reply, Defendant argues that while contradictory
notices can be served simultaneously, they do not specify if they are separate
notices of independent breaches, and that each must timely be cured.
 
III.    LEGAL
STANDARDS
      The bases for demurrer are limited by
statute and may be sustained for failure to state facts sufficient to state a
cause of action. (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10). A
demurrer “tests the sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law and raises
only questions of law.” (Schmidt
v. Foundation Health (1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 1702, 1706). The
court must assume the truth of (1) the properly pleaded factual allegations;
(2) facts that can be reasonably inferred from those expressly pleaded; and (3)
judicially noticed matters. (Blank
v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318). The court may
not consider contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. (Moore
v. Conliffe (1994) 7 Cal.4th 634, 638). 
IV.   
DISCUSSION
A.     
Defendant B&O’s Chapter 7 Bankruptcy
Petition does not affect Plaintiff’s ability to continue the action against Jupiter.
 
      A
voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection pursuant to 11
U.S.C.A. § 301) operates,
in pertinent part, as a stay of the commencement or continuation of a judicial
action against the debtor. (Id.) A nonbankruptcy court may not dismiss but may only stay an action
in which a defendant has filed for bankruptcy. (Traweek v. Finley, Kumble, etc. Myerson
& Casey (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1128, 1135.) As to the nonbankrupt Defendant (here,
Jupiter), the Court considers whether it is impracticable for Plaintiff to
proceed separately against Jupiter. If impracticable, the court can stay the
entire case. (Id.) 
      
B.      The demurrer by Jupiter is meritless. 
      A three-day notice to pay rent or quit is
valid and enforceable and may support an unlawful detainer action " only
if the lessor strictly complies with the specifically described notice conditions.”
(Kwok v. Bergren
(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 596, 600.) The landlord
may serve separate three-day notices where there are simultaneous breaches of
the rent obligation and other lease covenants. (Friedman, et al.  Cal. Practice Guide: Landlord-Tenant (The
Rutter Group 2022) ¶ 7:110.2. [“each notice
must specify they are separate notices for independent breaches and that each
must timely be cured. Otherwise, if the three-day notice to pay rent or quit is
served first, the three-day notice to cure other defaults or quit should state
that it does not waive the three-day notice to pay rent and that each notice
must be complied with." (Id.) 
      The first cause of action for
non-payment of rate is based on a three-day notice to pay rent or quit for
April 11-20, 2023, and for the month of May 2023. The notice was served on May
22, 2023. (Complaint, Ex. B, .pdf p. 41.) Plaintiff failed to pay the rent or
deliver the premises. (Complaint, ¶ 11-12.) The second cause of action is based
on a second three-day notice to pay common area maintenance expenses (“CAM”) or
quit for the same time period. (Complaint, ¶ 16.)
      The third cause of action is based on a third notice for failure
to pay late charges on the unpaid rent and CAM expenses for the same time
period. (Complaint, ¶ 20.) The fourth cause of action is based on the notice to
terminate based on the Defendant’s breach of the lease agreement precluding assignment
of the lease or subletting without the Plaintiff’s consent. (Complaint, ¶ 24). 
      Contrary to Defendant’s arguments, the four independent notices
are not contradictory, nor do they render the complaint uncertain. Each notice
is based on a separate breach of the lease agreement. Each notice states
“Acceptance by Lessor of a partial payment shall in no way constitute a waiver
of any default or breach by Lessee and shall merely reduce Lessee’s payment
obligation to the extent of such partial payment.” (Complaint, .pdf pp. 41, 45,
49.)  The fourth cause of action is a notice
to terminate based on Defendant’s breach of the no-subletting provision. There
is no implication that each independent breach of the lease agreement was waived
if the Defendant paid rent, CAMS, or late fees. 
V.     
CONCLUSION
      Accordingly, the demurrer to the complaint is OVERRULED.
Defendant Jupiter is ordered to file an answer within five days.
