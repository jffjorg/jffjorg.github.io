BACKGROUND:
 
On May 26, 2021, Plaintiff Ana Bertha Campos filed her
Complaint against Defendant Natalia Granados on causes of action arising from
Plaintiff’s employment by Defendant. 
 
On August 20, 2021, Defendant filed her Answer to the
Complaint. 
 
On February 25, 2022, the Court granted Plaintiff’s
unopposed motion to compel responses to requests for production of documents. 
 
On March 3, 2022, the Court: (1) granted Plaintiff’s
motion to compel responses to form interrogatories-general, set one; and (2)
granted Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to form
interrogatories-employment, set one. 
 
On April 26, 2022, the Court: (1) denied Plaintiff’s
motion to compel responses to requests for admission, set one; (2) denied as
moot Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to form interrogatories-general,
set two; (3) denied as moot Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to special
interrogatories, set one; and (4) granted Plaintiff’s motion for further
sanctions against Defendant and counsel of record for failure to comply with
Court’s February 25, 2022 Order.
 
On April 28, 2022, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion
for further sanctions against Defendant and counsel of record for failure to
comply with Court’s March 3, 2022 Order. At that time, the Court denied
Plaintiff’s request for issue, evidentiary, and terminating sanctions. 
 
On September 15, 2022, the Court: (1) granted in part
Plaintiff’s motion for an order compelling a supplemental response to form
interrogatories-general, set two; and (2) denied Plaintiff’s motion for an
order compelling a supplemental response to special interrogatories, set one. 
 
On February 7, 2023, the Court: (1) granted in part
Plaintiff’s motion for an order compelling further supplemental responses to
form interrogatories-general, set two. The Court awarded monetary sanctions and
noted that “[a]ny failure to comply with this order may subject defendant to
further escalating sanctions.” (Minute Order dated February 7, 2023, pp. 5–6.)
 
On February 23, 2023, the Court granted Defense Counsel’s
motion to be relieved as counsel. 
 
On March 14, 2023, the Court denied Defendant’s motion
for discovery monetary sanctions. 
 
On June 2, 2023, Plaintiff amended her Complaint to
substitute Doe 1 with Maria Cardenas. 
 
On January 23, 2024, by request of Plaintiff, the Clerk’s
Office entered default on Defendant Maria Cardenas. 
 
On January 25, 2024, Plaintiff filed Motion for
Terminating and/or Further Monetary Sanctions in the Amount of $2,700.00 as
Against the Defendant Natalia Granados for Failure to Comply to the February 7,
2023, Court Order (“Motion for Terminating Sanctions”). In support of her
Motion for Terminating Sanctions, Plaintiff concurrently filed: (1) Declaration
of Jack D. Josephson; and (2) Proposed Order. 
 
No opposition or other response has been filed to the
Motion for Terminating Sanctions. 

 
ANALYSIS:
 
I.         
Legal
Standard
 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030 gives
the court the discretion to impose sanctions against anyone engaging in a
misuse of the discovery process. A court may impose terminating sanctions by
striking pleadings of the party engaged in misuse of discovery or entering
default judgment. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd. (d).) A violation of a
discovery order is sufficient for the imposition of terminating sanctions. (Collison
& Kaplan v. Hartunian (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1611, 1620.) Terminating
sanctions are appropriate when a party persists in disobeying the court's
orders. (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 771, 795–796.)
 
A terminating sanction is a "drastic
measure which should be employed with caution." (Deyo, supra,
at p. 793.) 
 
"A decision to order terminating
sanctions should not be made lightly. But where a violation is willful,
preceded by a history of abuse, and the evidence shows that less severe
sanctions would not produce compliance with the discovery rules, the trial court
is justified in imposing the ultimate sanction." (Mileikowsky v. Tenet
Healthsystem (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 262, 279–280.)
 
While the court has discretion to impose
terminating sanctions, these sanctions "should be appropriate to the
dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery." (Deyo, supra,
84 Cal.App.3d at p. 793.) "[A] court is empowered to apply the ultimate
sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with
his discovery obligations." (Id.) Discovery sanctions are not to be
imposed for punishment, but instead are used to encourage fair disclosure of
discovery to prevent unfairness resulting for the lack of information. (See Midwife
v. Bernal (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 57, 64 [superseded on other grounds as
stated in Kohan v. Cohan (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 967, 971.)
 
"A trial court has broad discretion to
impose discovery sanctions, but two facts are generally prerequisite to the
imposition of nonmonetary sanctions . . . (1) absent unusual circumstances,
there must be a failure to comply with a court order, and (2) the failure must
be willful." (Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th
1315, 1327; but see Reedy v. Bussell (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1272, 1291
["willfulness is no longer a requirement for the imposition of discovery
sanctions."].)
 
II.       Discussion
 
Plaintiff moves the Court to issue
terminating sanctions and/or further monetary sanctions against Defendant
Natalia Granados. (Motion for Terminating Sanctions, p. 12:28–13:2.) Plaintiff
argues that Defendant Natalia Granados has not complied with the Court’s Minute
Order dated February 7, 2023, and Plaintiff’s Counsel declares that no further
discovery responses or ordered monetary sanctions have been paid. (Id. at
¶¶ 12–14 and Decl. Josephson, ¶¶ 12–14.)
 
The Court agrees with Plaintiff’s
argument. There is no evidence before the Court that indicates Defendant
Natalia Granados has responded to discovery or otherwise complied with the Court’s
Minute Order dated February 7, 2023. There is also no indication that any
sanction would result in Defendant serving responses to Plaintiff’s outstanding
discovery requests. Rather, considering that Defendant Natalia Granados
repeatedly failed to serve timely responses (even when she had an attorney),
has now failed to respond at all after the Court ordered her to do so, and has
not even responded to this motion for terminating sanctions, it appears that
Defendant Natalia Granados has ceased participating in this case. 
 
        The Court will issue terminating
sanctions. However, given that Defendant Natalia Granados has recently been
litigating this matter in propria persona, monetary sanctions would not
be appropriate here. 
 
III.     Conclusion
 
The Motion for Terminating Sanctions is GRANTED in part. 
 
Defendant Natalia Granados’s Answer is STRICKEN. 
 
        Plaintiff’s Request for Monetary
Sanctions is DENIED.
