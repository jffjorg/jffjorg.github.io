And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants part of the plaintiff's motion for terminating and/or further monetary sanctions against the defendant, Natalia Granados. The defendant's answer is stricken, and the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions is denied. The judge finds that the defendant has failed to comply with the court's order dated February 7, 2023, and has repeatedly failed to serve timely responses to discovery requests. The judge concludes that the defendant has ceased participating in the case and will issue terminating sanctions. However, due to the defendant's recent self-representation, the judge denies the plaintiff's request for monetary sanctions.
