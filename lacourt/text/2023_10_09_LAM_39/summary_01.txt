And here is the English-text summary:

In this tentative ruling, the judge grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend their bill of particulars. The plaintiff, Ellen Pittleman, and her company, Hybrid Entertainment, Inc., filed a complaint against the defendant, Spina Organics, LLC, and its owner, Mauro Spina. The plaintiff is seeking to amend their bill of particulars, which was served in April 2022, to add new information and evidence. The defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the original and amended bills of particulars are insufficient. However, the judge finds that there is no prejudice to the defendant and grants the plaintiff's motion. The amended bill of particulars is deemed to have been served, and the court's clerk will provide notice.
