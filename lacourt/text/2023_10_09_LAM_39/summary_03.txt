Here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of David Marco Weber v. Jay Stuart Rothman. The case stems from a retainer agreement between the parties, which Weber claims does not comply with Business and Professions Code section 6147(a). The Court has admitted Exhibit #1, the retainer agreement, into evidence and excluded the remaining exhibits and testimony. The Court finds that the agreement complies with the requirements of section 6147(a) and is thus not voidable under subdivision (b). Additionally, the Court denies Weber's request for a declaratory judgment on the issue of whether he owes Rothman $9,830.40. The Court sets no future dates and orders that Rothman may lodge a proposed judgment if necessary.
