And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to compel the production of documents by the defendant, Charles B. Chrystal Company, Inc. The motion was filed by the plaintiffs, Sueko Brockett and Steve Brockett, who had served a request for production of documents asking the defendant to produce all talc in its possession and all sales records of its talc. The defendant had objected to the requests, and the parties had participated in an informal discovery conference. The judge notes that fact discovery was closed and that the motion was filed after the cutoff date for motions relating to fact discovery. The judge cites a previous case, Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta Packaging Product, Inc. (2008), which holds that a party who notices a discovery motion to be heard after the discovery motion cutoff date does not have a right to have the motion heard. The judge also notes that even if the motion were granted, there would not be enough time for the items to be produced and tested by experts and for the experts to be deposed before the expert discovery cutoff date or the trial date. Therefore, the motion is denied.
