 Case Number:  23STCV05437    Hearing Date:   October 5, 2023    Dept:  15 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE MOTION TO COMPEL FURTER RESPONSES
            On
June 21, 2023, Plaintiffs Sueko Brockett and Steve Brockett served a request
for production of documents asking Defendant Charles B. Chrystal Company, Inc.
to produce all talc in its possession and all sales records of its talc.  On July 26, 2023, Defendant objected to the
two requests.  The parties participated
in an informal discovery conference on August 10, 2023.  On September 8, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a
motion to compel the production of the talc and sales records, with a hearing
date of October 5, 2023.
            This
is a preference case with a trial date of October 16, 2023.  Under the trial setting order, all fact
discovery was to be completed by September 25, 2023, all hearings on motions
relating to fact discovery were to be held by September 29, 2023, and all
expert discovery is to be completed by October 6, 2023.  Thus, fact discovery is closed, and this
motion to compel is set for hearing after the cutoff date for motions relating
to fact discovery.
            “[A]
party who notices a discovery motion to be heard after the discovery motion
cutoff date does not have a right to have the motion heard.”  (Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. v. Delta
Packaging Product, Inc. (2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1568, 1588.)  If a party wishes to complete discovery
proceedings or to have a motion concerning discovery heard closer to the
initial trial date, that party must make the showing under Code of Civil
Procedure section 2024.050.  By hearing a
motion to compel “without first deciding whether discovery should be reopened
for that purpose under all of the relevant circumstances,” a trial court abuses
its discretion.  (Pelton-Shepherd,
supra, 165 Cal.App.4th at p. 1588.)  
Plaintiffs did not ask to
reopen discovery or have a fact discovery motion heard closer to trial, did not
mention section 2024.050, and did not make the showing required under that
section.  In addition, as a practical
matter, even if the court heard and granted the motion, there is no time for
the items to be produced and tested by experts and for the experts to be
deposed before the expert discovery cutoff date of October 6, 2023 or the
October 16, 2023 trial date.
For these reasons, the
motion is DENIED.
The moving party is to
give notice.
