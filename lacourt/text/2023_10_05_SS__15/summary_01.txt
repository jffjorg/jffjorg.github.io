  - "The defendant may, but need not, present evidence that conclusively negates an element of the plaintiff's cause of action."
  - "If plaintiffs respond to comprehensive interrogatories seeking all known facts with boilerplate answers that restate their allegations, or simply provide laundry lists of people and/or documents, the burden of production will almost certainly be shifted to them once defendants move for summary judgment and properly present plaintiff's factually devoid discovery responses."

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The defendant, Gould Electronics Inc., has filed a motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication in relation to the plaintiff's claims that the plaintiff, Donald Welt, was exposed to asbestos from the defendant's products. The defendant argues that the plaintiff does not possess and cannot reasonably obtain evidence of exposure, and that the plaintiff's deposition testimony does not create a disputed fact. The court finds that the defendant has shifted the burden to the plaintiff to demonstrate the existence of triable issues of fact, and that the plaintiff has failed to do so. The court denies the motion for summary judgment, but grants the motion for summary adjudication.
