[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING
PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO COMPEL DEFENDANT’S FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR
PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS, SET TWO (AS TO PLAINTIFFS’ REQUEST FOR IMPOSITION OF
MONETARY SANCTIONS)
 
 
I.       
BACKGROUND
       The
complaint alleges that Defendant issued a written express warranty to
Plaintiffs in connection with Plaintiffs’ lease of a 2022 Kia Nero-EV. The
vehicle developed electrical and other defects. Defendant allegedly failed to
fulfill its statutory duties under the Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act
(“SBA”).
        
 
II.     
ARGUMENTS
        Plaintiffs’ motion argues that Defendant
agreed to provide documents responsive to Plaintiffs’ request. Any objections
Defendant made are without merit. The discovery is relevant to Plaintiffs’
claims. Defendant did not file an opposition. 
       Plaintiffs
filed notice of Defendant’s failure to oppose the motion. Plaintiffs confirm
that Defendant produced the documents at issue and provided a further response.
Plaintiffs maintain that monetary sanctions should be imposed.         
III.    DISCUSSION
       As
Defendant produced documents and a further response to the discovery at issue,
an order compelling a further response is no longer necessary. The Court DENIES
Plaintiffs’ request for imposition of sanctions as Plaintiffs did not give Defendant
proper notice. Requesting party must identify in the notice, the person, party
and attorney against whom the sanction is sought as well as the type of
sanction sought.  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.040.) Due process requires that a party seeking
sanctions give notice. (London v. Dri-Honing Corp. (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 999, 1008
