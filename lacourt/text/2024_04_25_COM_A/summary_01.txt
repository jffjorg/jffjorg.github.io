And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying the plaintiffs' motion to compel the defendant to provide further responses to their request for production of documents. The court also denied the plaintiffs' request for imposition of monetary sanctions against the defendant. The court's decision is based on the fact that the defendant has already produced the documents at issue and provided a further response to the discovery request. The court found that the plaintiffs did not provide proper notice of the motion to the defendant, and that due process requires that a party seeking sanctions give notice. The court cited the California Code of Civil Procedure and a 2004 case, London v. Dri-Honing Corp., in support of its decision.
