Petitioner, LEARNA

identification or fingerprinting. Petitioner may comply with this requirement
by any of the following methods:

Provide a valid California
driver’s license number or California ID Number (Petitioner may apply for and
obtain a new California driver’s license and provide that information to the
Probation Department);
(2)  
Provide a driver’s license number
issued from another state and identify the state that issued the
identification; or
(3)  
Contact the Probation Department
at (213) 974-5821 and request the Name Change Probation Officer, who can
provide instructions on how Petitioner may have fingerprints taken for a
LIVESCAN and to have results sent to the Department. 
Additionally, the court’s file
does not reflect that Petitioner has complied with the requirements for
publication of the Order to Show Cause. Code Civ. Proc., § 1277. Accordingly,
the court continues the hearing to June 18, 2023, at 8:30 a.m. in Department A of the
Compton Courthouse. Petitioner is ordered to comply with the foregoing
requirements prior to the hearing.
