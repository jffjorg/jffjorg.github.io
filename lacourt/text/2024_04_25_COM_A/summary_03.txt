And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on a special motion to strike certain claims brought by Plaintiff Johnathan Quintanar against Defendant Ruben Lopez, Jr. The Defendant has moved to strike the claims for conversion, misuse of judicial proceedings, false imprisonment, and wrongful eviction, alleging that they arise from protected activity under the anti-SLAPP statute (Code of Civil Procedure § 425.16). The court has granted the motion as to the second, third, and fourth causes of action, finding that these claims do arise from protected activity, while the claim for conversion does not. The court has also noted that the litigation privilege applies to bar claims arising from protected activity. The ruling is subject to change pending further briefing and argument.
