  Case Number:  23TRCV03187    Hearing Date:   June 10, 2024    Dept:  B ORDER - Taking Motion to Disqualify Off-Calendar and Denying CCP section 170.6On May 20, 2024, Plaintiff James Wright filed his Motion to
Disqualify Judge Douglas W.. Stern Pursuant to C.C.P. § 170.1 along with a
supporting Declaration of Arthur J. Travieso. 
Plaintiff filed the “motion” and calendared it for hearing on June 10, 2024.  It was not served on Judge Douglas W. Stern.
Code of Civil Procedure § 170.3(c)(3) provides:
“(3) Within 10 days after the filing or service, whichever
is later, … the judge may file a written verified answer admitting or denying
any or all of the allegations contained in the party’s statement and setting
forth any additional facts material or relevant to the question of
disqualification. The clerk shall forthwith transmit a copy of the judge’s
answer to each party or his or her attorney who has appeared in the action.”
Further, Code of Civil Procedure § 170.4(b) provides:
“(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (5) of subdivision (c) of
Section 170.3, if a statement of disqualification is untimely filed or if on
its face it discloses no legal grounds for disqualification, the trial judge
against whom it was filed may order it stricken.”
The Court shall not entertain the matter on June 10, 2024 as
a motion but instead shall address it within the time period set forth in Code
of Civil Procedure § 170.3(c)(3) quoted above.
The Motion on calendar for June 10, 2024 shall be taken
off-calendar.
Although the Motion is titled as seeking disqualification
pursuant to C.C.P. § 170.1, the Motion states that it is based on C.C.P. §
170.6 and the proposed Order of Transfer references only C.C.P. § 170.6.  To the extent that the Motion is construed to
be a challenge pursuant to C.C.P. § 170.6, it is DENIED as untimely.
