And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has decided to take the Motion to Disqualify Judge Douglas W. Stern off-calendar and deny it as untimely. The motion was filed by James Wright on May 20, 2024, but it was not served on Judge Stern. Under Code of Civil Procedure § 170.3(c)(3), the judge has 10 days to file a written verified answer admitting or denying the allegations in the motion. The judge has not filed such an answer, so the motion is considered untimely. The judge will not entertain the motion on its scheduled hearing date of June 10, 2024, but instead will address it within the time period set forth in the code.
