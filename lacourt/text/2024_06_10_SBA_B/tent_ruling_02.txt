Parties:                      Non-party Wells Fargo Bank, National Association
Responding
Party:                  None
Motion
to Substitute Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as Party Plaintiff
 
            The court considered the moving
papers.
RULING
            The motion is DENIED.
BACKGROUND
            The Court notes that the documents
referenced below are archived and are currently unavailable to view:
On February 6, 2014, plaintiff
Primary Financial Services, LLC filed a complaint against Andrew, Joshua & Associates,
Inc. and Suk Kang.
On June 18, 2014, plaintiff dismissed
Andrew, Joshua & Associates.  A default
was entered against Suk Kang.
On August 1, 2014, a default
judgment was entered.
DISCUSSION
            Non-party
Wells Fargo Bank requests an order substituting it as “party plaintiff” and to
amend the judgment entered on August 1, 2014 and correct it nunc pro tunc as of
the date of entry of judgment to read, “It is ordered, adjudged, and decreed
that plaintiff Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, recover from Suk Hyun
Kan, an individual, aka Suk Kang aka Steve Kang, the total sum of
$89,305.20.”  
            Wells
Fargo asserts that it is the assignee of plaintiff Primary Financial Services,
LLC.  Wells Fargo explains that it
assigned its right, title, and interest to Suk Hyun Kang aka Suk Kang aka Steve
Kang to CBV Collection Services Ltd., who had in turn assigned it to plaintiff
Primary Financial Services LLC for servicing. 
After judgment was entered, in December 2014, Wells Fargo purchased back
its right, title, and interest from CBV and PFS.  It contends that it now owns all rights and
remedies as related thereto.  Wells Fargo
argues that the requested substitution is appropriate as it reflects the
“correct standing of Wells Fargo” as the plaintiff.  Wells Fargo cites to CCP §368.5.
            CCP
§368.5 states:  “An action or proceeding
does not abate by the transfer of an interest in the action or proceeding or by
any other transfer of an interest. The action or proceeding may be continued in
the name of the original party, or the court may allow the person to whom the
transfer is made to be substituted in the action or proceeding.”
This
statute is inapplicable as the purported rights assigned are not the subject of
a pending action.
            The
motion is DENIED. 
 
ORDER
            The
motion is DENIED.
            Moving
party is ordered to give notice of ruling.
