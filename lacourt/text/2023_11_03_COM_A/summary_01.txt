And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the receiver's motion to terminate the receivership, discharge the receiver, and exonerate the receiver's bond is GRANTED. The receiver was appointed to take control of the property and has incurred fees and costs in the process. The receiver's counsel was authorized and has submitted invoices for their services. The receiver's certificate for $75,000 is entitled to super-priority status. The judge has also denied Defendant Cohen's demurrer and motion to quash service of summons, finding that Cohen made a general appearance and cannot challenge service. The judge has also overruled Defendant Natarajan's objections to the receiver's reports and counsel, finding that Natarajan did not object to the receiver's reports or counsel. The judge has also found that the receiver's fees and costs are reasonable and necessary, and that the receiver's remaining and unsecured fees and costs are not entitled to the same priority as the receiver's certificate.
