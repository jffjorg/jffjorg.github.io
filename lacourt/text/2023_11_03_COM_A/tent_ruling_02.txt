[TENTATIVE] ORDER DENYING
 MOTION TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL FOR PLAINTIFF
 
The complaint, filed on September 8,
2022, arises from alleged dental malpractice. Gilbert Quiñones, counsel for Plaintiff,
filed this motion on August 29, 2023, for an order to be relieved as
counsel because of a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. 
The Court previously continued the
hearing from October 16, 2023 because counsel served only the notice of hearing
on Plaintiff but not the declaration and proposed order. (California
Rules of Court, rule 3.1362 (d). The Court’s electronic file does
not reflect that the declaration, proposed order, and continued hearing date were
served on Plaintiff. Accordingly, the motion is DENIED.
