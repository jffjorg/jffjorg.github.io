And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying the Petition for Change of Name filed by Jasiah Leshawn Dwight Woods, a minor, on April 11, 2023. The Petitioner sought to change his name to Josiah Leshawn Asante’ Amir Woods-Iribeck. However, the Court found that the Petitioner failed to serve the other parent with the Order to Show Cause at least 30 days before the hearing, as required by law. Additionally, the Petitioner did not file proof of publication of the Order to Show Cause. Despite two continuances, the Petitioner did not cure these defects, and therefore, the Petition is denied.
