In the Matter of:  Jasiah
 Leshawn Dwight Woods, a minor
Friday, November

[TENTATIVE]
ORDER DENYING
 PETITION FOR CHANGE OF NAME
 
Petitioner, Jasiah
 Leshawn Dwight Woods, by and through his mother, Jennifer Iribeck,
filed this Petition on April 11, 2023, for an Order for Change of
Name to Josiah Leshawn Asante’ Amir Woods-Iribeck.  
              The Court
continued this hearing from July 6, 2023 and again on September 14, 2023, since
only one parent consented to the name change, and Petitioner did not serve the
other parent with the Order to Show Cause at least 30 days before the hearing,
either by personal service if the other parent was located in California or by
mail if outside California.  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 1277(a)(4).) Petitioner also did not file proof of publication of the
Order to Show Cause. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1277.)
              The Court’s
electronic file does not reflect that Petitioner cured these defects despite
two continuances. Accordingly, the Petition is DENIED.
