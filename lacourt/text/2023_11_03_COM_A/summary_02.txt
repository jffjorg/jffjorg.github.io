And here is the summary in English text:

The Court has issued a tentative ruling denying Plaintiff's counsel's motion to be relieved as counsel. The complaint, filed on September 8, 2022, arises from alleged dental malpractice. The motion to be relieved as counsel was filed on August 29, 2023, citing a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. However, the Court previously continued the hearing due to insufficient service, as the notice of hearing was served on the Plaintiff but not the declaration and proposed order. As the Court's electronic file does not reflect that the necessary documents were served on the Plaintiff, the motion is denied.
