Krysta Jaime (“Jaime”), Kaleb Gonzalez (“Kaleb”), and Ernesto Gonzalez

(2) Plaintiffs allege Kaleb and his mother, Jaime, have been injured as a
result of Defendants’ failure to repair the wall heaters at Plaintiffs’ rental
home which resulted in Plaintiffs’ on-going carbon monoxide exposure; (3) Kaleb
has suffered serious and potentially permanent injuries from continued exposure
to carbon monoxide in his home; (4) Kaleb’s symptoms include: coughing,
headaches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tiredness, heart palpitations and
anxiousness, and some of these symptoms persist to this day; (5) all Defendants
have been served and have appeared in this action; and (6) Kaleb has a
“substantial interest” in this case as a whole.

Legal
Standard
C.C.P.
§36(b) provides, “A civil action to recover damages for wrongful death or
personal injury shall be entitled to preference upon the motion of any
party to the action who is under 14 years of age unless the court finds that
the party does not have a substantial interest in the case as a whole.”  (C.C.P. §36(b), emphasis added.)
C.C.P.
§36(c)(1) provides, “a party may file and serve a motion for preference supported
by a declaration of the moving party that all essential parties have been
served with process or have appeared.” 
(C.C.P. §36(c)(1).)
C.C.P.
§36(f) provides:
Upon the granting of such
a motion for preference, the court shall set the matter for trial not more than
120 days from that date and there shall be no continuance beyond 120 days from
the granting of the motion for preference except for physical disability of a party
or a party’s attorney, or upon a showing of good cause stated in the record.
Any continuance shall be for no more than 15 days and no more than one
continuance for physical disability may be granted to any party.
 
(C.C.P.
§36(f).)
 
Discussion
Plaintiffs’
motion for trial preference is granted.
A
minor child who (1) is under the age of 14; (2) alleges personal injury damages;
(3) has a substantial interest in the case as a whole; and (4) has served all
defendants with a summons and complaint is entitled to a mandatory trial
preference.  (Peters v. Superior Court
(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 218, 223-224 [“We hold that section 36, subdivision
(b) is mandatory.”].)  
Here,
Kaleb is under the age of 14 (Decl. of Jaime ¶15), alleges personal injury
damages (see TAC), has a substantial interest in the case as a whole
(Decl. of Jaime ¶15), and Plaintiffs have served all Defendants with a summons
and complaint.  Therefore, this Court has
no discretion to deny Plaintiffs’ motion.  (Peters, 212 Cal.App.3d at pgs. 223-224.)
Plaintiffs’
reply indicates that they are amenable to severing the cross-complaints from Plaintiffs’
trial on the TAC to afford Yazouri and SMS more time for discovery.
C.C.P.
§1048(b) provides that “The court, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid
prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy,
may order a separate trial of any cause of action, including a cause of action asserted
in a cross-complaint, or of any separate issue or of any number of causes of
action or issues, reserving the right of trial by jury required by the
Constitution or a statute of this state or of the United States.”
This Court
has the discretion to determine the order in which claims or issues are tried,
and the selection and scheduling of those phased determinations will not be
disturbed absent an abuse of that discretion.  (Antelope Valley Groundwater Cases
(2020) 59 Cal.App.5th 241, 273.)
Therefore,
this Court is inclined to grant Plaintiffs’ motion only as to Plaintiffs’ claim
in the TAC.
Accordingly,
Plaintiffs’ motion is granted only as to their claims in the TAC.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiffs’
motion is granted only as to their claims in the TAC.  
Moving
Party to give notice.
