And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the plaintiffs' motion for trial preference is granted, but only as to their claims in their third amended complaint. The motion was filed by Krysta Jaime, Kaleb Gonzalez, and Ernesto Gonzalez, who are seeking damages for personal injuries allegedly caused by the defendants' failure to repair wall heaters at their rental home. Kaleb, who is under the age of 14, has suffered serious and potentially permanent injuries from continued exposure to carbon monoxide. The judge found that Kaleb has a substantial interest in the case as a whole and that all defendants have been served and have appeared in the action. The judge is inclined to grant the motion only as to the plaintiffs' claims in the third amended complaint, and is willing to sever the cross-complaints from the trial on the third amended complaint to allow for more time for discovery. The judge's ruling is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 36(b), 36(c)(1), and 36(f), which provide for trial preference in cases involving minors and for the scheduling of trials upon the granting of a motion for preference.
