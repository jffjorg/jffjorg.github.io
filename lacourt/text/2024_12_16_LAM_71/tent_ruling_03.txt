         vs.

  DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY.


 Case No.: 
  23STCV17350
 
 
 
 Hearing Date:  December 16, 2024



 

Plaintiff Jeffrey Ito’s motion, in pro
per, to compel himself to an independent mental examination is denied.
 
Plaintiff
Jeffrey Ito (“Ito”) (“Plaintiff”), in pro per, moves to compel himself to
submit to an independent mental examination (“IME”) by Dr. Nily Osman, a neurologist.  (Notice Motion, pg. 2; C.C.P. §§2032.020, 2032.310,
2032.320.)
 
Procedural
History
Plaintiff
filed the instant motion on October 9, 2024. 
Defendant University of Southern California (“USC”) (“Defendant”) filed
its opposition on December 3, 2024.  As
of the date of this hearing no reply has been filed.
 
Legal
Standard
C.C.P
§2032.020(a) states: 
Any party may obtain discovery,
subject to the restrictions set forth in Chapter 5 (commencing with Section
2019.010), by means of a physical or mental examination of (1) a party to
the action, (2) an agent of any party, or (3) a natural person in the
custody or under the legal control of a party, in any action in which the
mental or physical condition . . . of that party or other person is in controversy in the action.
 
(C.C.P
§2032.020(a), emphasis added.)
C.C.P.
§2032.310 provides, “[i]f a party desires to obtain discovery by a mental
examination, . . . the party shall obtain leave of court.”  (C.C.P. §2032.310(a).)  “A motion for an examination under
subdivision (a) shall specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and
nature of the examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if any,
of the person or persons who will perform the examination.”  (C.C.P. §2032.310(b).)
 
Meet
and Confer
C.C.P.
§2032.310(b) provides, “A motion for an examination under subdivision (a) shall
specify the time, place, manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the
examination, as well as the identity and the specialty, if any, of the person
or persons who will perform the examination. The motion shall be accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.”  (C.C.P. §2032.310(b), emphasis added.)
Plaintiff
failed to file a declaration stating that he met and conferred with Defendant,
which violates C.C.P. §2032.310(b).  (See
Decl. of Ito.)
 
Discussion
Plaintiff’s
motion is denied.  
The
physical or mental examination contemplated by C.C.P. § 2032.010, et seq. is that
of an opposing party when the physical or mental condition of that party has
been put in issue by that party’s contentions. 
(See, e.g., C.C.P. § 2032.220.)  Plaintiff
may not demand his own examination.  
Nor
is the expense of an examination under the present circumstances an expense
subject to Plaintiff’s fee waiver.  The
Court has no ability to waive a third party’s right to a fee for services.  
Finally,
Plaintiff’s motion does not comply with C.C.P. §2032.310(b)’s requirement that
the demand for an examination include the “time, place, manner, conditions,
scope, and nature of the examination...” 
(C.C.P. §2032.310(b).)
Accordingly,
Plaintiff’s motion is denied.
 
Conclusion
Plaintiff’s
motion to compel himself to submit to an IME by Dr. Nily Osman is denied.
Moving
Party to give notice.
