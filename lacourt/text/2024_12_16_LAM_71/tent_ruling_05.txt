Discussion
Having reviewed Cross-Defendant’s
Motion to Compel Cross-Complainant’s Compliance to Provide Responses to RFP 1,
Response Nos. 10-19 and 21-52, the Court rules as follows:
          On March 22, 2024, Cross-Defendant served RFP 1 on Cross-Complainant.  (Decl. of King ¶4, Exh. A.)  On
May 13, 2024, Cross-Complainant served verified
responses, wherein it agreed
to produce all non-privileged documents responsive to RFPs Request Nos. 10-19
and 21-52.  (Decl. of King ¶5, Exh. B.)  Cross-Complainant’s responses were not
accompanied by any document production.
(Decl. of King ¶5.)  On August 23, 2024, Cross-Complainant
provided Cross-Defendant with its first estimated production date on September
13.  (Decl. of King ¶6, Exh. C at pg.
58.)  Cross-Defendant now moves to compel
compliance.  
          Cross-Defendant’s motion to compel Cross-Complainant’s
compliance with its statement that it would provide Code-compliant responses to
RFP 1, Request Nos. 10-19 and 21-52 is granted in part and denied in part.  (C.C.P. §2031.320(a).)  Cross-Defendant’s motion is denied as to compelling
compliance to produce text messages and/or documents from Louis Friedel
(“Friedel”) and Steven White (“White”). 
Cross-Defendant’s motion is otherwise granted.
Cross-Defendant requests
monetary sanctions in the amount of $3,500.00 against Cross-Complainant.  
          The Court awards sanctions against Cross-Complainant pursuant
to C.C.P. §2031.320(b) in the amount of $3,500.00, calculated as follows:
([4.0 hours to prepare
instant motion + 3.0 hours to review the opposition, prepare a reply, and
attend the hearing on motion] x $500.00/hour) = $3,500.00
The sanctions are payable by
Cross-Complainant AG-SCH 8150 Sunset Boulevard Owner, L.P. within 20 days of this
order.
Cross-Complainant’s request
for sanctions against Cross-Defendant is denied.
Moving Party is to give
notice of this ruling.
