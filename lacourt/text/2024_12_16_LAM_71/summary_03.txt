The judge also noted that Plaintiff failed to file a meet and confer declaration, as required by C.C.P. section 2032.310(b). Additionally, the judge found that a party may not demand their own examination, and that the expense of an examination is not subject to Plaintiff's fee waiver. The motion is denied.
