SUMMARY OF FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY
 
This action arises out of habitability issues at an
apartment Plaintiff Keyman Pittman (Plaintiff) leased from Defendant De Soto
Pacific Owner 1 LLC (Defendant).  On 1/18/24,
Plaintiff filed this action against Defendant for: (1) Tortuous Breach of
Warranty of Habitability, (2) Breach of Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment, (3) Nuisance,
(4) Civil Code 1942.4, (5) Negligence and (6) Anti-Harassment Ordinance.
 
After meet and confer efforts failed to resolve the
issues Defendant had with the complaint, on 4/15/24, Defendant filed and served
the instant motion seeking an order striking portions of Plaintiff’s complaint
regarding punitive damages (¶¶15, 46, 50, p.11:4-6 and Prayer ¶4).  (See Farkhondeh  Decl.). 
Plaintiff has opposed the motion and Defendant has filed a reply to the
opposition. 
 
ANALYSIS
 
A motion to strike is the proper vehicle to challenge a
claim for punitive damages.  See Grieves
(1984) 157 CA3d 159, 163-164; CCP 431.10(b); CCP 435(b)(1); CCP 436.
 
To state a claim for punitive damages, a plaintiff must
plead facts which support a finding that the defendant acted with malice,
oppression or fraud against the plaintiff. 
Civil Code 3294; College Hospital, Inc. (1994) 8 C4th 704,
721.  Conclusory allegations are
insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.  Ebaugh (1972) 22 CA3d 891,
894-895.  
 
Here, Plaintiff has failed to alleged facts to show that
Defendant intended to injure him or that Defendant committed the type of
despicable conduct necessary to support the claim for punitive damages.  See Lackner (2006) 135 CA4th
1188, 120, 1211, fn.14; Taylor (1979) 24 C3d 890, 895-896.
Additionally, Plaintiff has failed to allege sufficient
facts to state a claim for punitive damages against an entity defendant such as
Defendant.  An employer cannot be held
liable for punitive damages based on the acts of an employee, unless it had
advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee and employed him/her with a
conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others or authorized or ratified
the wrongful conduct or was personally guilty of oppression, fraud or malice.  Civil Code 3294(b).  With regard to a corporate employer, the
advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act
of oppression, fraud or malice must be on the part of an officer, director or
managing agent.  Id.  A “managing agent” includes only those
corporate employees who exercise “substantial discretionary authority over
decisions that ultimately determine corporate policy.”  White (1999) 21 C4th 563, 565; Cruz
(2000) 83 CA4th 160, 167.
 
Here, Plaintiff has not identified, by name or position,
any managing agent of Defendant, which is a limited liability company, who
engaged in malicious, fraudulent or oppressive conduct and Plaintiff has failed
to plead facts to show that Defendant had advance knowledge of the unfitness of
any unidentified employee of Defendant who committed such acts which were
authorized or ratified by a managing agent of Defendant.  
 
The Court also notes that at times Plaintiff refers to unidentified
“Defendants,” collectively, and at other times refers to an unidentified “Defendant,”
in the singular, making it unclear who Plaintiff contends did what and on
behalf of whom.  (See Complaint ¶¶12-16,
19, 22, 25-29, 31, 36, 38, 44, 46-47, 50, 53). 
Further, the complaint names a different/incorrect plaintiff, Nancy
Duze,” in the opening line.  (See
Complaint, p.1:17).
 
CONCLUSION
 
The motion to strike is granted.  Due to the liberal policy of allowing leave
to amend and because this is only the original complaint, Plaintiff is given
the opportunity to try to cure the defects in the pleading.  A First Amended Complaint is due within 30
days.
