And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the defendant's motion for sanctions. The defendant sought an order granting sanctions in the amount of $12,550.00 against the plaintiff and their counsel, Marsha Berkowitz, pursuant to CCP 128.7, in connection with the plaintiff's Third Application filed on 7/24/23. The judge finds that the plaintiff's filing of the Third Application was not frivolous or objectively unreasonable, and therefore does not warrant the imposition of sanctions. The judge also finds that the amount of sanctions sought by the defendant is excessive.
