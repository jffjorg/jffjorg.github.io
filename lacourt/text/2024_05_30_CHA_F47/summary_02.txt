The judge noted that the plaintiff failed to identify the managing agent of the defendant who engaged in malicious, fraudulent, or oppressive conduct and failed to plead facts to show that the defendant had advance knowledge of the unfitness of any unidentified employee of the defendant who committed such acts.
