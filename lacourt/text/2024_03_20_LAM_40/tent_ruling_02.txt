II. Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award: GRANTED.
A. Legal Standard
“Any party to an arbitration in which
an award has been made may petition the court to confirm, correct or vacate the
award.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.)
“A proceeding under th[e] [Arbitration
title of the Code of Civil Procedure] in the courts of this State [i.e.,
pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1280-1294.4] is commenced by filing a petition.
Any person named as a respondent in a petition may file a response thereto. The
allegations of a petition are deemed to be admitted by a respondent duly served
therewith unless a response is duly served and filed. The allegations of a
response are deemed controverted or avoided.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1290.)
The petition must: “(a) [s]et forth
the substance of or have attached a copy of the agreement to arbitrate unless the
petitioner denies the existence of such an agreement”; “(b) [s]et forth the names
of the arbitrators” and “(c) [s]et forth or have attached a copy of the award and
the written opinion of the arbitrators, if any.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.) The
petition must also “name as respondents all parties to the arbitration and may name
as respondents any other persons bound by the arbitration award.” (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 1285.) A petition to confirm an award must be served and filed within four years
after the date the petitioner was served with a signed copy of the award. (Code
Civ. Proc., § 1288.) 
If a petition or response requesting
confirmation is duly filed and served, the court must confirm, correct and
confirm, or vacates the award or dismiss the proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286;
see Horn v. Gurewitz (1968) 261 Cal.App.2d 255, 258; Pacific Law
Group U.S.A. v. Gibson (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 577, 580; Cooper v. Lavely
& Singer Professional Corp. (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 1, 10.)
“The court may not vacate an award
unless … [¶] [a] petition or response requesting that the award be vacated has
been duly served or filed ….” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.4, subd. (a).)  A response seeking to correct and confirm or
vacate an arbitration award must be served and filed within ten days of service
of a petition to confirm that same arbitration award, unless the timeframe is
extended by agreement of the parties or “for good cause, by order of the
court.” Thus, a court may not vacate an award pursuant to a petition for that
relief that was not duly served or filed. (See Oaktree Capital Mgmt., L.P.
v. Bernard (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 60, 64 [a response served out of the
ten-day window has not been “duly served” as required for relief by Code Civ.
Proc., § 1286.4].)
Statutes set forth specific grounds
upon which an arbitrator’s award may be vacated. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1286.2.)
Except on these grounds, arbitration awards are immune from judicial review in proceedings
to challenge or enforce the award. (Moncharsh v. Heily & Blase (1992)
3 Cal.4th 1, 12-13 (Moncharsh).) Thus, courts will not review the sufficiency
of the evidence to support the award. (Morris v. Zuckerman (1968) 69 Cal.2d
686, 691.) Nor will courts pass upon the validity of the arbitrator’s reasoning.
(Ibid.) The court simply may not substitute its judgment for that of the
arbitrator. (Ibid.) Further, errors of fact or law committed by the arbitrator,
no matter how egregious, are not grounds for challenging the arbitrator’s award
under California law. (Moncharsh, supra, at p. 11.)
“If an [arbitration] award is confirmed,
judgment shall be entered in conformity therewith. The judgment so entered has the
same force and effect as and is subject to all the provisions of law relating to,
a judgment in a civil action of the same jurisdictional classification; and it may
be enforced like any other judgment of the court in which it is entered, in an action
of the same jurisdictional classification.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1287.4.)
B. Analysis
1. Procedural
Requirements
Here, Swift Financial’s Petition
satisfies the procedural requirements for a petition to confirm an arbitration
award.
The Petition (1) attaches a copy of
the loan agreement executed by WebBank’s President and Eugene Kim as owner of
Passu Inc. and guarantor on the loan, which contains the relevant arbitration
clause (Petition, Attach. 4(b), § 7(b)), (2) sets forth the name of the
arbitrator, Brent O. E. Clinksale (American Arbitration Association) (Petition,
§ 6), and (3) attaches a copy of the arbitration award (Petition, Attach.
8(c)). (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285.4.)
Swift Financial’s petition also names
as respondents Passu Inc., Eugene Kim, and Does 1 to 10. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1285;
see Petition, § 1.)
Last, Swift Financial’s petition
was served and filed within four years after the date the petitioner was served
with a signed copy of the award. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1288; see Petition, p. 1
[filed Jul. 7, 2023] & Attach. 8(c) [Apr. 13, 2023, Award]; 12/7/23 Proof
of Service; 1/16/24 Proof of Publication.) 
2. Substantive
Discussion
Here, service of the petition has
been effected on Passu Inc. and Eugene Kim. (12/7/23 Proof of Service; 1/16/24
Proof of Publication.) Yet, the record fails to reflect that Passu Inc. or
Eugene Kim filed a petition to vacate the arbitration award in favor of Swift
Financial within 10 days of service. Swift Financial’s petition is thus
unopposed.
For the sake of completeness, the
Court notes that a review of the relevant loan agreement and the arbitration
award shows that the requested relief here—confirmation of the award, judgment
according to the award, interest at the statutory rate, costs according to
proof, attorneys’ fees according to proof, and prejudgment interest from April
13, 2023, to the date of judgment—is proper, though the Court makes a note
below relating to fees.
The loan agreement executed by
WebBank’s President and Eugene Kim as owner of Passu Inc. and guarantor on the
loan contains an arbitration clause providing that upon default upon the
relevant loan agreement, if WebBank prevailed in an action between the parties
for that default, WebBank was entitled to attorneys’ fees and court costs.
(Petition, Attach. 4(b), § 7(b).) Here, Swift Financial stands as servicing
agent for WebBank. (Petition, § 1.)
The arbitrator determined: “Claimant
is the prevailing party and is awarded $79,419.16 in damages jointly and
severally against Respondents. Claimant is also awarded $1,800.00 in attorney’s
fees jointly and severally against Respondents, jointly and severally, pursuant
to the loan agreement. The administrative fees of the American Arbitration
Association totaling $1,925.00, and the compensation of the arbitrator totaling
$2,100.00 shall be borne by Respondents, jointly and severally. Therefore,
Respondents, jointly and severally, shall reimburse Claimant the sum of
$4,025.00, representing that portion of said fees in excess of the apportioned
costs previously incurred and paid by Claimant.” (Petition, Attach. 8(c); cf.
Petition, § 10 [seeking confirmation of the arbitration award, which includes a
specific award of attorneys’ fees and administrator costs].)
Based on the above, the Court
determines that a confirmation of the award of $85,244.16 is proper, as is a
judgment relating thereto, to include costs and attorneys’ fees (where the arbitration
award already includes fees for the arbitration proceedings), and pre- and
post-judgment interest at the applicable rates. 
III. Conclusion
Petitioner Swift Financial, LLC’s
Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award is GRANTED with the caveat that any
additional request for fees shall not include any of the fees granted herein. 
Petitioner Swift Financial, LLC to
file a proposed judgment, as well as a memorandum of costs and motion for fees.
