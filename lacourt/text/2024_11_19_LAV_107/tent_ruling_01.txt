  Case Number:  24VECV02551    Hearing Date:   November 19, 2024    Dept:  107    SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES NORTHWEST DISTRICT   Kantresa Johnson et al., Plaintiffs.     v.  TCT XVI, LLC and Does 1-50 Defendants.       Case Number             Department     24VECV02551                             107   COURT’S [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:        Motion to Strike   [THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: Denied.   BACKGROUND¿  This is a landlord-tenant dispute. Plaintiffs Kantresa Johnson as individually and Guardian ad Litem for Aaron Johnson, Vanessa Johnson, and Marland Johnson¿(“Plaintiffs”) rent a unit located at 8504 Willis Ave. Panorama City, California, 91402 (the “Subject Property”). (Complaint ¶ 1.) Defendant TCT XVI, LLC is the owner and/or property manager of the Subject Property. (Complaint ¶ 14.) Plaintiffs entered a rental agreement for the Subject Property on or around December 2017. (Complaint ¶ 25.) On or around February 2023, Plaintiffs noticed toxic mold contamination in the Subject Property and notified management and/or their managing agents. (Complaint ¶ 26.) Defendants failed to remediate the conditions at the Subject Property. (Complaint ¶ 26.)  On May 31, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Defendant and Does 1-50, alleging ten causes of action for breach of warranty of habitability: violation of Civil Code section 1941.1, breach of warranty of habitability: Health & Safety Code section 17920.3, breach of warranty of habitability: violation of Civil Code section 1942.4, negligence – premises liability – negligence per se, nuisance, intentional infliction of emotional distress, breach of contract, breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment, and unfair business practices: violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200, et. seq.   On October 15, 2024, Defendant filed a motion to strike portions of Plaintiffs’ complaint (the “Motion”). On November 5, 2024, Plaintiffs filed an opposition, to which no reply was filed. ¿ PROCEDURAL MATTERS¿ ¿ A. Timeliness of Filings¿ ¿ Per California Code of Civil Procedure section¿435, subdivision (b)(1), a motion to strike should be filed within 30 days after service of the complaint. (See also Code Civ. Proc., § 412.20(a)(3).)   Per California Code of Civil Procedure §¿1005, subdivision (b), moving papers should be filed at least 16 court days before they are set for hearing, oppositions thereto should be filed at least nine court days before the set hearing, and replies to any oppositions should be filed at least five court days before the set hearing. Judges have discretion to consider an untimely pleading.¿ (McAllister v. County of Monterey (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 253, 281-282.)  Plaintiffs served Defendant with the complaint by personal service on June 4, 2024. (Proof of Service filed 06/06/24.) Defendant filed the Motion on October 15, 2024. October 15, 2024, is more than thirty days after June 4, 2024. The Motion is untimely under section 435, subdivision (b)(1), but this court exercises its discretion and considers the Motion.  The Motion and Opposition were timely filed under section 1005, subdivision (b). ¿ B. The Meet & Confer Requirement¿ ¿ California Code of Civil Procedure §¿435.5, subdivision (a) requires parties to “meet and confer” in good faith before the filing of a motion to strike to attempt to informally resolve the objections raised in the motion to strike.   Defendant’s counsel submits a declaration stating she met and conferred with Plaintiffs’ counsel by telephone and email prior to filing the Motion but they were unable to come to an agreement. (Mintesnot Declaration ¶ 2.)   This court finds Defendant satisfied the meet and confer requirement. ¿ LEGAL STANDARD¿ ¿ The court may, upon a motion, or at any time in its discretion, and upon terms it deems proper, strike any irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading. (Code Civ. Proc. § 436(a).) The court may also strike all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the laws of this state, a court rule, or an order of the court. (Code Civ. Proc. § 436(b).) The grounds for moving to strike must appear on the face of the pleading or by way of judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc. §¿437(a).)¿ ¿ A motion to strike is appropriate to attack a claim for punitive damages. (Grieves v. Superior Court (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 159, 164.) “In order to survive a motion to strike an allegation of punitive damages, the ultimate facts showing an entitlement to such relief must be pled by a plaintiff.¿In passing on the correctness of a ruling on a motion to strike, judges read allegations of a pleading subject to a motion to strike as a whole, all parts in their context, and assume their truth.” (Clausen v. Superior Court (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1253, 1255 (internal citations omitted).) “Further, even though certain language pleads ultimate facts or conclusions of law, such language when read in context with the facts alleged as to defendants' conduct may adequately plead the evil motive requisite to recovery of¿punitive¿damages.” (Monge v. Superior Court (1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 503, 510.)¿  “In order to state a prima facie claim for¿punitive¿damages, a complaint must set forth the elements as stated in the general¿punitive¿damage¿statute,¿Civil Code section 3294.” (Turman v. Turning Point of Central California, Inc. (2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 53, 63.) To justify a punitive damages award, the defendant must be “guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice.”¿(Civ. Code., § 3294.) “He must act with the intent to vex, injure or annoy, or with a conscious disregard of the plaintiff’s rights.” (Penner v. Falk (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 858, 867,)  Civil Code section 3294, subdivision (c)(1) defines malice as “conduct which is intended by the defendant to cause injury to the plaintiff or despicable conduct which is carried on by the defendant with a willful and conscious disregard of the rights or safety of others.”     “A claim ‘for exemplary damage may be supported by pleading that the wrong was committed willfully or with a design to injure.’” (Spinks v. Equity Residential Briarwood Apartments (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1055.) “In order to justify an award of punitive damages on this basis, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant was aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his¿conduct, and that he wilfully and deliberately failed to avoid those consequences.” (Taylor v. Superior Court (1979) 24 Cal.3d 890, 895–96.)¿¿ ¿ “Punitive¿damages¿may not be¿pleaded¿generally.” (Today’s IV, Inc. v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (2022) 83 Cal.App.5th 1137, 1193.) “The mere allegation an intentional tort was committed is not sufficient to warrant an award of¿punitive¿damages.” (Grieves v. Superior Court, supra, 157 Cal.App.3d 159 at 166.) And, “’conclusory characterization of defendant's conduct as intentional, wilful and fraudulent is a patently insufficient statement of “oppression, fraud, or malice, express or implied,’ within the meaning of¿section 3294.” (Brousseau v. Jarrett (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 864, 872.) “Not only must there be circumstances of oppression, fraud or malice, but facts must be alleged in the pleading to support such a claim.” (Grieves v. Superior Court, supra, 157 Cal.App.3d at p. 166; Today’s IV, Inc. v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, supra, 83 Cal.App.5th at p. 1193 [“In addition to the requirement that the operative complaint set forth the elements as stated in¿section 3294, it must include¿specific¿factual allegations showing that defendant's conduct was oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious to support a claim for¿punitive¿damages.”].)¿  DISCUSSION¿ ¿ Defendant moves to strike portions of Plaintiffs’ complaint referencing the punitive damages claim. (Notice of Motion pp. 2-3; Complaint ¶¶ 27, 31-32, 48, 80, 78, 83, 110, 116, 118, 119-122, 126, 132, 145, 155.)  Defendant argues the complaint’s factual allegations are insufficient to support a claim for punitive damages because the “Complaint provides no factual basis to support the higher threshold required to warranty the imposition of punitive damages, and Defendants’ conduct as alleged in the Complaint is nothing more than conclusory. Additionally, Plaintiff’s allegations are so vague they are essentially meaningless for the purposes of pleading a claim for exemplary damages.” (Motion p. 6.)   Plaintiffs argue they properly pled facts indicating Defendant’s malicious acts because the complaint alleges Defendant was aware of the toxic mold contamination but failed to abate it, Defendant did not notify Plaintiffs of the condition despite their knowledge of it, Defendant and their agents were aware that absent appropriate maintenance toxic mold contamination would develop, Defendant collected rent from Plaintiffs despite their knowledge of the mold contamination, and Defendant was provided adequate notice of the kind of conduct charged against them. (Opposition pp. 6-7.)   In Stoiber v. Honeychuck (1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 903, 920, a residential tenant “pleaded sufficient facts to support her prayer for exemplary damages” when her complaint both “alleged that defendant had actual knowledge of defective conditions in the premises including leaking sewage, deteriorated flooring, falling ceiling, leaking roof, broken windows, and other unsafe and dangerous conditions” and “alleged that defendants ‘In maintaining said nuisance,… acted with full knowledge of the consequences thereof and the damage being caused to plaintiff, and their conduct was willful, oppressive and malicious.’”¿  Further, in Penner v. Falk, supra, 153 Cal.App.3d at p. 867, the Court of Appeal stated the pleadings adequately supported a punitive damages award because “[t]he pleadings sufficiently allege facts setting forth long existing physical conditions of the premises which portend danger for the tenants” and “[t]he pleadings also set out that respondents knew of those conditions for up to two years, had power to make changes, but failed to take corrective and curative measures.” The Court stated that “[i]f proven, these allegations would support an award of punitive damages.” (Id.)   Plaintiffs allege that on or around February 2023, “Plaintiffs noticed toxic mold contamination in Subject Unit and immediately notified management and/or their managing agents, specifically, ‘Sauer’ of the toxic mold contamination in Plaintiffs’ Unit. Defendants and their agents and managers failed to remediate the uninhabitable conditions (specifically but not limited to, toxic mold contamination), at the Subject Property and Plaintiffs’ Unit.” (Complaint ¶ 26.) Plaintiffs also allege that “[o]n or around February 8, 2023, the Housing Authority of the [C]ity of Los Angeles inspector ‘JANET GALLARDO’ notified (inspection #CO360650) Defendants about the uninhabitable conditions of the Subject Unit and request[ed] the uninhabitable conditions to be resolved by March 02, 2023” but “[t]he uninhabitable conditions were not resolved for an extended period.” (Complaint ¶ 91.) And, Plaintiffs allege that “[o]n or around March 13, 2023, the Housing Authority of the [C]ity of Los Angeles inspector ‘SARAH SHOOSHANI’ notified (re-inspection #CO0363977) Defendants about the continuance uninhabitable conditions of the Subject Unit that was not abated and request the uninhabitable conditions to be resolved by March 28, 2023” but [t]he uninhabitable conditions was not resolved for an extended period.” (Complaint ¶ 92.) In sum, Plaintiffs allege Defendant was aware of the contamination by February 8, 2023, and the March 13, 2023, notification by the City of Los Angeles’ Housing Authority shows that Plaintiffs alleged Defendant knew the conditions were ongoing. Thus, like Stoiber v. Honeychuck, Plaintiffs allege Defendant had actual knowledge of the Subject Property’s defective condition. And, like Penner v. Falk, Plaintiffs state facts alleging long-existing physical conditions of the premises presenting a danger to the tenants.  Plaintiffs further allege that “Defendants intentionally and willfully failed to remedy the issues raised by Plaintiffs by maintaining a company policy of apathy and/or denial. Defendants failed to remedy the toxic mold contamination at the Subject Property.” (Complaint ¶ 27.) Plaintiffs also allege that “Defendants aware of the toxic mold contamination at the complex affected multiple units and common areas for extended period, as prior and current tenants’ complaint about the toxic mold contamination in their units. Defendants failed to abate the toxic mold contamination from the Subject property and Subject Unit. More importantly, Defendants failed to disclose this material fact to plaintiffs, they failed to conduct reasonable inspections of the Subject [P]roperty, and they failed to take actions and abate the toxic mold contamination.” (Complaint ¶ 29.) Finally, Plaintiffs allege that “Defendants, and each of them, own other rental properties, and are experienced managers of residential property and are aware that absent appropriate maintenance of the toxic mold contamination serious uninhabitable conditions will develop that would seriously and materially affect the Plaintiffs’ quiet and peaceful enjoyment of the Subject Unit.” (Complaint ¶ 44.) Thus, like Stoiber v. Honeychuck, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant acted with knowledge of the consequences thereof and damages being caused to Plaintiffs. Further, like Penner v. Falk, these allegations indicate Defendant knew about the conditions but failed to take corrective measures.   Finally, Plaintiffs allege that “Defendants’ actions and omissions were intentional, malicious, fraudulent and oppressive because they were done with a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of Plaintiffs, as well as other tenants’ subject to the same or similar uninhabitable conditions.” (Complaint ¶ 77.) Thus, like Stoiber v. Honeychuck, Plaintiffs allege Defendant’s conduct was willful, oppressive, and malicious.  Defendant argues these allegations are conclusory. However, when read as a whole, Plaintiffs’ complaint alleges that Plaintiffs, on or around February 2023, notified management and/or their managing agents of the toxic mold contamination, inspectors from the City of Los Angeles’ Housing Authority notified Defendant about the uninhabitable conditions, Defendant as experienced managers were aware that toxic mold contamination would seriously affect Plaintiffs, but, despite that knowledge, Defendant failed to take action to remediate the contamination. (Complaint ¶¶ 26, 91-92, 44, 27.) Thus, Plaintiffs allege specific facts supporting the punitive damages award.  Plaintiffs seek punitive damages for their implied warranty of habitability, nuisance, breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress causes of action. (Opposition p. 4; Complaint ¶¶ 78, 116, 145, 155.) (While the Plaintiffs do not explicitly state they are seeking punitive damages in the intentional infliction of emotional distress cause of action section of the complaint, they generally seek punitive damages in the prayer for relief and state in their opposition that they are seeking punitive damages for the intentional infliction of emotional distress cause of action. (Opposition p. 4.))  Punitive¿damages¿. . . are recoverable for… the infliction of emotional distress.” (Spinks v. Equity Residential Briarwood Apartments, supra, 171 Cal.App.4th at p. 1055, internal citations omitted.) Punitive damages are also recoverable for an intentional tort nuisance cause of action. (Stoiber v. Honeychuck, supra, 101 Cal.App.3d at p. 920.) Finally, punitive damages are available for a cause of action showing a “tortious breach of the warranty of habitability based on [a defendant’s] alleged intentional, malicious and outrageous conduct.” (Smith v. David (1981) 120 Cal.App.3d 101, 118 fn. 3.)    “[W]hen the landlord has breached the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, but the tenant remains in possession of the premises, the tenant’s remedy is to ‘sue for breach of contract damages.” (Ginsberg v. Gamson (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 873, 902.) When the tenant remains in possession of the premises, “[t]here [is] no tort liability established that would entitle [them] to punitive damages.” (Id.)   As to the eighth cause of action for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, Plaintiffs seek punitive damages by alleging that “Defendants’ conduct in continuously breaching the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment has been intentional, reckless, malicious and oppressive, thereby entitling Plaintiffs to recover punitive damages in an amount to be determined at trial.” (Complaint ¶ 145.) Plaintiffs allege that they were “forced to vacate the subject property due to severe toxic mold contamination.” (Complaint ¶ 28.) Thus, Plaintiffs allege that they are no longer in possession of the premises and may, therefore, recover punitive damages. (See Ginsberg v Gamson, supra, 205 Cal.App.4th at pp. 898-898 [“[S]ome courts have implicitly or explicitly indicated a tenant may recover punitive damages in connection with a claim for breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment, or identified the claim as a tort. However, all of those cases describe wrongful eviction claims. In other words, they are cases in which the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment is breached by a wrongful eviction.”])  CONCLUSION  For the foregoing reasons, this court denies the Motion.    Dated:    November 19, 2024    __________________________________           Hon.
