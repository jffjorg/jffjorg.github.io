The court notes that the complaint alleges that the defendant was aware of the toxic mold contamination in the subject property, failed to remediate it, and failed to disclose it to the plaintiffs. The court also notes that the defendant's alleged conduct was intentional, reckless, malicious, and oppressive.

The court denies the motion to strike, finding that the complaint's factual allegations are sufficient to support a claim for punitive damages.
