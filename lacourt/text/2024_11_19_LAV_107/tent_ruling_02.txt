 Case Number:  24VECV02624    Hearing Date:   November 19, 2024    Dept:  107    SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES NORTHWEST DISTRICT  David Pasternak,  Plaintiff.     v.  Jonathan Perlman and Does 1-10,  Defendants.       Case Number             Department     24VECV02624                  107   COURT’S [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE:        Demurrer without Motion to Strike   [THE FOLLOWING IS A TENTATIVE RULING IN THE ABOVE CASE]: ¿¿ BACKGROUND¿¿  Defendant Jonathan Perlman (“Defendant”) is the former husband of Plaintiff David Pasternak’s (“Plaintiff”) daughter, Leah Pasternak (“Leah”). (First Amended Complaint “FAC” ¶ 10.) Leah and Defendant are obtaining a divorce. (FAC ¶ 10.)   Between April 2015 and April 2023, Defendant and Plaintiff entered a series of agreements where Plaintiff agreed to pay Defendant’s mortgage payments, property taxes, utilities, and insurance and Defendant promised to repay Plaintiff “in cash or from sale proceeds” on a property located at 5187 Lindley Avenue, Tarzana, CA 91356 (the “Subject Property”). (FAC ¶¶ 10-11.) Defendant did not repay Plaintiff and the Subject Property “is now for sale [with] no escrow instructions to repay Plaintiff.” (FAC ¶¶ 10, 16.)  On June 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant and Does 1 to 10, alleging six causes of action for breach of oral contract, fraud, intentional infliction of emotional distress, constructive trust, elder abuse, and unjust enrichment.  On July 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint against Defendant and Does 1 to 10, alleging four causes of action for breach of oral contract, fraud, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and elder abuse.  On September 9, 2024, Defendant demurred to Plaintiff’s first amended complaint. On October 4, 2024, Plaintiff filed an opposition. On October 12, 2024, Defendant filed a reply.  PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS  Timeliness “A person against whom a complaint or cross-complaint has been filed may, within 30 days after service of the complaint or cross-complaint, demur to the complaint or cross-complaint.” (Code Civ. Proc., §¿430.40(a).)   Plaintiff submits a proof of service showing the first amended complaint was served on Defendant on July 8, 2024. (Proof of Service attached to FAC.) On August 8, 2024, Defendant filed a declaration in support of a thirty-day automatic extension to file the demurrer. Defendant then filed the demurrer on September 9, 2024.  This court finds that the demurrer was timely filed. Meet and Confer California Code of Civil Procedure section¿430.41, subdivision (a) requires parties to “meet and confer” in good faith before the filing of a demurrer to attempt to informally resolve the objections raised in the demurrer.¿The demurring party is required to file and serve with the demurrer a declaration either confirming that parties were unable to resolve the issues raised by the demurrer despite having met and conferred or that the opposing party failed to meet and confer with the demurring party in good faith. (Code Civ. Proc. §¿430.41(a)(3).)  Defendant’s counsel submits a declaration stating they contacted Plaintiff’s counsel to discuss the issues with the first amended complaint, but Defendant’s and Plaintiff’s counsel were unable to reach a resolution. (Nadel Declaration ¶ 2.)   This court finds that Defendant satisfied the meet and confer requirement.  LEGAL STANDARD¿¿ ¿¿¿¿ As a general matter, in a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice.¿(Donabedian v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.)¿“A demurrer tests the pleading alone, and not the evidence or the facts alleged.” (E-Fab, Inc. v. Accountants, Inc. Servs. (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1315.) As such, the court assumes the truth of the complaint’s properly pleaded or implied factual allegations. (Id.) The only issue a demurrer is concerned with is whether the complaint, as it stands, states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 740, 745.)¿A complaint is sufficient if it contains “[a]¿statement¿of the¿facts¿constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and concise language.” (Code Civ. Proc. §¿425.10(a)(1).) Under this standard, a “complaint ordinarily is sufficient if it alleges ultimate rather than evidentiary facts.” (Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 550.)  A party may demur to a complaint because the complaint “does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(e).) A party may also demur because “[t]he pleading is uncertain.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(f).) “’[U]ncertain’ includes ambiguous and unintelligible.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(f).) Further, a party may demur when the complaint alleges “an action founded upon contract” and “it cannot be ascertained from the pleading whether the contract is written, is oral, or is implied by conduct.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 430.10(g).)   Demurrer for uncertainty are strictly construed, because discovery can be used for clarification. (Khoury v. Maly’s of Cal., Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Against a demurrer, a plaintiff is required only to “set forth in his complaint the essential facts of his case with reasonable precision and with particularity sufficiently specific to acquaint the defendant of the nature, source, and extent of his cause of action.” (Elder v. Pac. Bell Tel. Co. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 841, 858.) ¿ DISCUSSION  Defendant argues the first amended complaint is vague, it fails because it does not indicate whether the contract was written, oral, or implied by conduct, the fraud cause of action does not plead facts with particularity, the intentional infliction of emotional distress cause of action does not plead outrageous conduct, and the elder abuse cause of action does not detail when plaintiff became an elder. (Demurrer pp. 4-8.)  Plaintiff’s opposition argues the first amended complaint sufficiently pleads fact supporting the four causes of action. (Opposition pp. 3-9.)  Breach of Contract  Cause of Action   Defendant argues the first amended complaint does not meet the criteria for an oral or implied contract. (Demurrer p. 4.)  The elements of a breach of contract claim are: (1) existence of a contract; (2) plaintiff’s performance or excuse for nonperformance; (3) defendant’s breach; and (4) resulting damage. (Wall Street Network, Ltd. v. N. Y. Times Co. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1171, 1178.)  The first amended complaint alleges that “[o]n or about April 3, 2015[,] Plaintiff and Defendant entered into an oral agreement.” (FAC ¶ 30.) The first amended complaint also alleges that Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a second oral agreement in or about April 2020. (FAC ¶ 13.) Thus, the first amended complaint sufficiently alleges that the breach of contract claim is based on oral contracts.   The first amended complaint alleges that the terms of the April 3, 2015, agreement between Defendant and Plaintiff were “1) Plaintiff would purchase [the Subject Property], 2) Defendant, his wife and their three (3) children would live there; 3) Defendant would maintain all debt on the house; 4) [the Subject Property] would be sold at a later date so that the Plaintiff can recoup his investment in [the Subject Property]; 5) [the Subject Property] sale proceeds would be used to repay Plaintiff for various credit(s) extended to the Defendant; [and] 6) until sold Defendant would hold [the Subject Property] in trust for Plaintiff, notwithstanding the characterization of its title.” (FAC ¶ 30.)   The first amended complaint also alleges that, regarding the April 2020 agreement, “Defendant requested Plaintiff to ‘bail him out’ of debt several times” and “in exchange for Plaintiff’s payment of Defendant’s accrued debt, Plaintiff would be repaid by Defendant, or from the sale proceeds on [the Subject Property] when sold in the future.” (FAC ¶ 13.) Thus, the first amended complaint sufficiently alleges the existence of two contracts.  The first amended complaint alleges that Plaintiff “has satisfied all covenants, conditions and performance of the agreement except those that are discharged or excused by defendants' material breaches.” (FAC ¶ 31.) Thus, the first amended complaint sufficiently alleges Plaintiff performed under the contracts or has an excuse for nonperformance.  The first amended complaint also alleges that “Defendant has violated his promise to hold [the Subject Property] in trust for the Plaintiff by placing it for sale without escrow instructions to repay Plaintiff[,]” “Defendant has breached the agreement having failed to reimburse the Plaintiff on his initial investment for the purchase of [the Subject Property] at its present value of $1.3 million dollars (anticipated to be $1.5 million dollars by time of trial); by failing to reimburse the Plaintiff for all mortgage payments paid by the Plaintiff on [the Subject Property]; [and] by failing to reimburse the Plaintiff for all credit extended to the Defendant.” (FAC ¶¶ 32-33.) The first amended complaint further alleges that “Defendant is attempting to steal a property that is now worth over $1.3 million dollars for zero contribution on its original purchase, and failure to pay many mortgage payments and related expenses.” (FAC ¶ 34.) Thus, the first amended complaint alleges that Defendant breached the contracts by failing to reimburse Plaintiff.  Finally, the first amended complaint alleges that “[t]he Plaintiff continues to pay expenses and the mortgage to date without contribution by the Defendant and ha[s] been damaged in an amount not yet fully known but in an amount no less than $1.5 million dollars” and “Plaintiff has been damaged in an amount to be proven at trial but in an amount not less than $1.3 million . . .  plus interest according to proof for compelling Plaintiff to expend legal and attorneys fees to rectify the problem(s) directly caused by Defendant’s breach of the oral contract(s).” (FAC ¶ 36.) Thus, the first amended complaint alleges damages resulting from Defendant’s breach.  Thus, the first amended complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of action for breach of contract.  Statute of Limitations  Defendant argues the first amended complaint contains “no allegations to explain why the claims of the financial transactions more than two (2) years before the filing of the lawsuit are not time barred.” (Demurrer p. 5.)  An oral contract is governed by a two-year statute of limitations. (Code Civ. Proc., § 339.)   The first amended complaint alleges that “[i]n April 2023 Defendant and Leah separated. Defendant was removed from [the Subject Property] pursuant to the grant of a 5 year Domestic Violence Restraining Order. During this time period, and to the present, Defendant stopped paying the mortgage and other related debts to [the Subject Property].” (FAC ¶¶ 14-15.) The first amended complaint further alleges that “[the Subject Property] is now for sale and no escrow instructions to repay Plaintiff.” (FAC ¶ 16.)   These allegations imply that Defendant breached the contract in April 2023. Plaintiff filed the complaint on June 5, 2024. Thus, the first amended complaint is not barred by the statute of limitations.  Statute of Frauds  Defendant argues “many allegations of real property interest require some allegation of a written agreement, otherwise the Stat[u]te of Frauds (Cal. Civ. C. 1624) would apply” and the first amended complaint does “not explain why no interest the plaintiff claims exists was never supported by any writing.” (Demurrer p. 5.)  Code of Civil Procedure section 1624, subdivision (a)(3) provides “The following contracts are invalid, unless they, or some note or memorandum thereof, are in writing and subscribed by the party to be charged or by the party's agent . . . An agreement for the leasing for a longer period than one year, or for the sale of real property, or of an interest therein; such an agreement, if made by an agent of the party sought to be charged, is invalid, unless the authority of the agent is in writing, subscribed by the party sought to be charged.”  The pleading alleges that “Defendant has violated his promise to hold [the Subject Property]” and “Defendant is attempting to steal a property that is now worth over $1.3 million dollars for zero contribution on its original purchase, and failure to pay many mortgage payments and related expenses.” (FAC ¶¶ 32-34.) Thus, on its face, the pleading alleges the contract was made to secure an interest in real property. However, Plaintiff has not alleged the existence of, nor submitted, a writing to satisfy the statute of frauds. (See Sterling v. Taylor (2007) 40 Cal.4th 757, 765 [“The statue of frauds does not require a written contract; a ‘note or memorandum . . . subscribed by the party to be charged’ is adequate.”])  Thus, the demurrer to Plaintiff’s first cause of action is sustained.  Fraud  The elements of fraud are: (1) a misrepresentation; (2) knowledge of falsity; (3) intent to defraud; (4) justifiable reliance; and (5) resulting damage. (Beckwith v. Dahl (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 1039, 1060.) Fraud elements must be alleged with particularity. (Id.) “This particularity requirement necessitates pleading facts which ‘show how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.” (Robinson Helicopter Co., Inc. v. Dana Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 979, 993.)  The first amended complaint alleges that “[o]n or about April, 2020, Defendant made the fraudulent representation of material facts to the Plaintiff. Those representations were that in exchange for transferring title for [the Subject Property] to Defendant and LEAH, as a probate tool, the Parties would hold [the Subject Property] in trust for the Plaintiff. Defendant further fraudulently represented to the Plaintiff that [the Subject Property] would be sold in the future and the Plaintiff would be paid for its purchased investment and credit extended to the Defendant.” (FAC ¶ 39.)  The first amended complaint further alleges that “Defendant’s representations were in fact false. The truth was Defendant wanted the Plaintiff to purchase a house for his family to live in. Defendant’s plan was to continue to make sporadic payments on the mortgage and bills relying upon Plaintiff to be his bank. Defendant after gaining Plaintiff’s trust convinced the Plaintiff to convey [the Subject Property’s] title to Defendant and LEAH erasing Plaintiff’s name from title. Defendant concealed and suppressed these facts from the Plaintiff.” (FAC ¶ 40.) Thus, the first amended complaint alleges Plaintiff made misrepresentations.  The first amended complaint also alleges that “Defendant knew his representations to be false at the time when making said representation(s).” Thus, the first amended complaint sufficiently alleges that Defendant had knowledge of their falsity.  The first amended complaint further alleges that “Defendant’s representations were made with the . . . intent to defraud and induce the Plaintiff to act as described herein[,]” and “[s]aid fraudulent acts were done in such a manner to intentionally induce Plaintiff to spend $745,000 to purchase [the Subject Property] to Defendant’s benefit and the Plaintiff’s financial detriment.” (FAC ¶¶ 39, 41.) Thus, the first amended complaint alleges Defendant intended to defraud Plaintiff.  The first amended complaint alleges that “Plaintiff acted in justifiable reliance upon the truth of Defendant’s representations” and Plaintiff was “induced to and did rely on the representations of Defendant[.]” (FAC ¶¶ 39, 43.) Thus, the first amended complaint alleges Plaintiff justifiably relied on Defendant’s misrepresentations.   Finally, although the first amended complaint alleges that “[s]aid fraudulent acts were done in such a manner to intentionally induce Plaintiff to spend $745,000 to purchase [the Subject Property] to Defendant’s benefit and the Plaintiff’s financial detriment” the first amended complaint does not clearly allege that the $745,000 to purchase the Subject Property are the resulting damages from Defendant’s fraud.  Thus, because Plaintiff has not alleged resulting damages, the demurrer to Plaintiff’s second cause of action is sustained.  Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress  Defendant argues Plaintiff’s intentional infliction of emotional distress cause of action fails because it does not plead outrageous conduct. (Demurrer p. 7.)  ¿“The elements of a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress are (1) the defendant engages in extreme and outrageous conduct with the intent to cause, or with reckless disregard for the probability of causing, emotional distress; (2) the plaintiff suffers extreme or severe emotional distress; and (3) the defendant's extreme and outrageous conduct was the actual and proximate cause of the plaintiff's extreme or severe emotional distress.” (So v. Shin (2012) 212 Cal.App.4th 652, 671.)¿ To be outrageous, the conduct must be “so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized society.” (Huntingdon Life Sciences, Inc. v. Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA, Inc. (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 1228, 1259.)  The first amended complaint incorporates paragraphs 1 through 46 into the intentional infliction of emotional distress cause of action. (FAC ¶ 48.) Those paragraphs allege that Plaintiff purchased the Subject Property in April 2015 for $745,000 and Plaintiff and Defendant entered into an oral agreement in April 2015, where Plaintiff and Defendant would hold title to the Subject Property as joint tenants and Defendant would maintain all debt for the Subject Property. (FAC ¶¶ 11-12.) The first amended complaint also alleges that Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a second oral agreement in April 2020, where Plaintiff would pay Defendant’s debt and Plaintiff would be repaid by Defendant or repaid upon the sale of the Subject Property. (FAC ¶¶ 11, 13.) The first amended complaint further alleges that Defendant stopped paying the debts on the Subject Property, Plaintiff made the payments, “Defendant gained the benefit of retaining what became a 50-50 community property interest in [the Subject Property] with Leah in 2020” and the Subject Property “is now for sale [with] no escrow instructions to repay Plaintiff.” (FAC ¶¶ 15-16.) The first amended complaint alleges “Defendant is attempting to steal a property that is now worth over $1.3 million dollars for zero contribution on its purchase, mortgage and related expenses and maintenance paid by Plaintiff.” (FAC ¶ 18.) Next, the first amended complaint alleges “Defendant complained to Plaintiff that his grand children need a home to live in. It has been discovered that in truth, Defendant used his own children (i.e. needing a place to live) as an excuse and instrument to impose undue influence over elderly, retired, and caring Grandparent(s)” and further alleges that “Defendant executed a plan to rob his in laws of their hard earned money and life savings under the false premise that the Plaintiff was providing a benefit to the grandchildren.” (FAC ¶¶ 22.) And that “Defendant used his position and expertise as a psychological expert and licensed mental health care professional, to imposed undue influence upon the Plaintiff” and “Defendant falsely represented to the Plaintiff that transferring title in [the Subject Property] to Defendant and LEAH would be in their best interests.” (FAC ¶ 24.) Finally, Plaintiff alleges that “[o]nce Defendant convinced Plaintiff to transfer title from Plaintiff -Defendant Joint Tenants to Jonathan and Leah, community property, Defendant ‘still’ did not want to be obligated on the expense(s) that go with owning a home [and] Defendant continued to readily accept the benefit(s) of Plaintiff’s payments when Defendant was running short on money, which was often.” (FAC ¶ 25.)  If true, these allegations demonstrate a callous disregard for Plaintiff, but that does not mean the allegations rise to the level as being “so extreme as to exceed all bounds of that usually tolerated in a civilized society.” (Huntingdon Life Sciences, Inc. v. Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA, Inc., supra, 129 Cal.App.4th at 1259; see also Moncada v. West Coast Quartz Corp. (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 768, 780-781 [“Here, the allegations in the first amended complaint consist of defendants misleading plaintiffs into believing they would be compensated in an amount¿that would allow them to retire if they continued to work for West Coast until the company was sold. While the allegations of defendants’ conduct if true, demonstrate a callous disregard for plaintiffs' professional and personal well-being, the alleged conduct as stated is not extreme or outrageous to support a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress.”]) Accordingly, the first amended complaint does not sufficiently allege that Defendant’s conduct was outrageous.  The first amended complaint alleges that Defendant’s actions “were intentional, extreme, and outrageous.” (FAC ¶ 48.) Thus, the first amended complaint alleges Defendant acted with intent.   The first amended complaint also alleges that “[a]s a direct legal and proximate result of such acts of Defendants, and DOES 1 through 10, and each of them, Plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress which has caused Plaintiff to sustain severe, serious and permanent injuries to [his] person[.]” (FAC ¶ 49.) Thus, the first amended complaint alleges Plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress and Defendant’s conduct was the cause of Plaintiff’s severe emotional distress.  Thus, because Plaintiff has not alleged that Defendant engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct, the demurrer to Plaintiff’s third cause of action is sustained.   Elder Abuse  Defendant argues Plaintiff’s elder abuse cause of action fails because it does not detail when plaintiff became an elder. (Demurrer pp. 4-8.)  Financial elder abuse occurs when a person or entity: “(1) Takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud, or both. (2) Assists in taking, secreting, appropriating, obtaining, or retaining real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult for a wrongful use or with intent to defraud, or both. (3) Takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains, or assists in taking, secreting, appropriating, obtaining, or retaining, real or personal property of an elder or dependent adult by undue influence, as defined in Section 15610.70.” (Welf. & Inst. Code § 15610.30(a).)   “A person or entity shall be deemed to have taken, secreted, appropriated, obtained, or retained property for a wrongful use if, among other things, the person or entity takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains the property and the person or entity knew or should have known that this conduct is likely to be harmful to the elder or dependent adult.” (Welf. & Inst. Code § 15610.30(b).) “For purposes of this section, a person or entity takes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains real or personal property when an elder or dependent adult is deprived of any property right, including by means of an agreement, donative transfer, or testamentary bequest, regardless of whether the property is held directly or by a representative of an elder or dependent adult.” (Welf. & Inst. Code § 15610.30(c).)  An “’[e]lder’ means any person residing in [California], 65 years of age or older.” (Welf. & Inst. Code § 15610.27.)   The first amended complaint alleges that “Plaintiff was 65 years of age or older at the time of Defendant’s conduct.” (FAC ¶ 54.) The first amended complaint further alleges that “Plaintiff is an individual residing in or doing business in the County of Los Angeles, State of California.” (FAC ¶ 1.) Thus, the first amended complaint alleges that Plaintiff is an elder living in California.  The first amended complaint also alleges that “[o]n or about April, 2020, Defendant made the fraudulent representation of material facts to the Plaintiff. Those representations were that in exchange for transferring title for [the Subject Property] to Defendant and LEAH, as a probate tool, the Parties would hold [the Subject Property] in trust for the Plaintiff. Defendant further fraudulently represented to the Plaintiff that [the Subject Property] would be sold in the future and the Plaintiff would be paid for its purchased investment and credit extended to the Defendant.” (FAC ¶ 39.) The first amended complaint further alleges that Plaintiff has made the associated payments, . . . Defendant gained the benefit of retaining what became a 50-50 community property interest in [the Subject Property] with Leah in 2020” and “[the Subject Property] is now for sale and no escrow instructions to repay Plaintiff.” (FAC ¶ 16.) Finally, the first amended complaint alleges that “Defendant represented to the Plaintiff a future sale would reimburse the Plaintiff for all credit extended to the Defendant. Plaintiff believed Defendant’s representations to be true when they were made, not knowing his secret intent was to breach the agreement upon transfer of title. Defendant never had any intention of holding [the Subject Property] in trust for Plaintiff. When Defendant represented - promised to hold [the Subject Property] in trust for Plaintiff that representation was false when made.” (FAC ¶ 28.) Thus, the first amended complaint alleges that Defendant retained Plaintiff’s real property with the intent to defraud Plaintiff.  Accordingly, because the first amended complaint sufficiently alleges a financial elder abuse cause of action, the demurrer to Plaintiff’s fourth cause of action is overruled.    LEAVE TO AMEND ¿ Where a demurrer is sustained, leave to amend must be allowed where there is a reasonable possibility of successful amendment. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) “If there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.” (Youngman v. Nevada Irrigation Dist. (1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245.)   This court finds that there is a reasonable possibility Plaintiff can successfully amend the complaint and grants Plaintiff leave to amend.  CONCLUSION¿ ¿ For the foregoing reasons, this court sustains the demurrer and grants Plaintiff leave to amend.  Dated:    November 19, 2024    __________________________________           Hon.
