RESPONDING PARTY:
None
 
            The Court has considered the moving
papers.  The motion is unopposed.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 1005(b).) 
 
BACKGROUND
             On December 2, 2021, Plaintiff filed the
original putative class action complaint in this matter.  On January 28, 2022, Plaintiff filed a first
amended complaint to also allege a representative action under PAGA.  The operative complaint alleges Defendant Brighton
Collectibles, LLC (“Defendant”) failed to pay overtime at the regular rate of
pay, failed to provide meal periods, failed to pay meal period premiums at the
regular rate of pay, failed to timely pay wages, and failed to provide accurate
itemized wage statements.  
 
            On June 18, 2024, the parties filed
a Joint Notice of Settlement.  
 
            On August 12, 2024, Plaintiff filed
the instant motion to approve the PAGA settlement reached in this action (the
“Motion”).  The Motion was properly
served and is unopposed.  
 
DISCUSSION
Standard 
Pursuant to Labor Code section 2699(l)(2), “[t]he
superior court shall review and approve any settlement of any civil action
filed pursuant to this part.  The
proposed settlement shall be submitted to the agency at the same time that it
is submitted to the court.”  The purpose
of this requirement is to “ensur[e] that any negotiated resolution is fair to
those affected.”  (Williams v.
Superior Court (2017) 3 Cal.5th 531, 549.)  “Aside from the requirement that the court
‘review and approve’ a settlement in a civil action filed under PAGA (§ 2699,
subd. (l)(2)), PAGA itself does not provide a standard for this review.”  (Moniz v. Adecco USA, Inc. (2021) 72
Cal.App.5th 56, 75.)  “[A]
trial court should evaluate a PAGA settlement to determine whether it is fair,
reasonable, and adequate in view of PAGA’s purposes to remediate present labor
law violations, deter future ones, and to maximize enforcement of state labor
laws.”  (Id. at 77.)
 
“A PAGA representative action is therefore a type of
qui tam action.”  (Iskanian v. CLS
Transportation Los Angeles, LLC (2014) 59 Cal.4th 348, 382 abrogated on
other grounds by Viking River Cruises, Inc. v. Moriana (2022) 142 S.Ct.
1906.)  Approval of a qui tam action
generally requires a court determination “that the proposed settlement is fair,
adequate, and reasonable under all of the circumstances.”  (Gov. Code, § 12652(e)(2)(B).)  “Because many of the factors used to evaluate
class action settlements bear on a settlement's fairness—including the strength
of the plaintiff's case, the risk, the stage of the proceeding, the complexity
and likely duration of further litigation, and the settlement amount—these
factors can be useful in evaluating the fairness of a PAGA settlement. Given
PAGA’s purpose to protect the public interest, we also agree with the LWDA and
federal district courts that have found it appropriate to review a PAGA
settlement to ascertain whether a settlement is fair in view of PAGA’s purposes
and policies.”  (Moniz, supra, 72
Cal.App.5th at 77.)
 
Terms of the Settlement 
            The terms of the settlement are set forth in the Joint Stipulation of
PAGA Settlement (“Agreement”).  (Declaration
of Simon L. Yang [“Yang Decl.”], ¶ 6, Exh. 1.) 
The Motion and Settlement were properly provided to the LWDA. (Yang Decl.
¶ 20., Exh. 4.)
 
            The Agreement provides
for a settlement amount (the “Settlement Amount”) of $180,000.00. (Agreement, §
3.1.)  From the Settlement Amount,
attorneys’ fees will be no more than 33% of the Settlement Amount (or $60,000.00)
and litigation costs of up to $15,000.00 are permitted—though Plaintiff’s counsel
seeks reimbursement of $11,617.16 in costs only.  (Id., § 3.1.1; Yang Decl. ¶¶ 11-12, Ex. 2.)  The requested General Release Payment is
$10,000.00.  (Agreement, § 3.1.2.)  The requested Administration Costs are $5,000.00.
 (Agreement, § 3.1.3.)  The PAGA Penalty Fund thus will be $93,382.84,
and pursuant to statute, 75% of the PAGA Penalty Fund (or $70,037.13) would
constitute the LWDA Payment, and 25% of the PAGA Penalty Fund (or $23,345.71)
would be payable to Aggrieved Employees based on the number of relevant pay
periods worked by each Aggrieved Employee. 
(Id., § 3.1.4; Yang Decl., ¶ 12.)
 
The release provided is appropriately narrow to
solely encompass claims for PAGA penalties that could have been asserted in
this action.  (Agreement, § 5.) The
Settlement Administrator shall be Phoenix Settlement Administrators.  (Id., § 4.1.)
 
The Total Settlement Amount is Fair, Reasonable, and
Adequate Under the Circumstances of the Case
Here, Defendant provided the relevant numbers of pay
periods in which alleged overtime underpayments occurred and in which meal
period entitlements arose, among other things—enabling Plaintiff to assess the
full value of the PAGA claims and further enabling negotiations to take place
between the parties.  (Yang Decl., ¶ 5.)  Both Plaintiff’s counsel and Defendant’s
counsel are experienced in wage and hour and PAGA litigation, and Plaintiff’s
counsel has been approved as class counsel in numerous wage and hour class
actions.  (Declaration of Larry W. Lee
(“Lee Decl.”) ¶¶ 2-5; Yang Decl. ¶¶ 13-16.) 
The parties reached the proposed settlement after extensive negotiations
and a mediation session with an experienced wage and hour mediator.  (Yang Decl., ¶ 6.)  These circumstances suggest that the
settlement is the result of arm’s length negotiations between the parties and
their counsel, and is entitled to a presumption of fairness. 
 
            Plaintiff calculated the
maximum total PAGA exposure to be $1,214,100.00 – or $100 for each of approximately
12,141 relevant pay periods that Plaintiff contended had Labor Code violations based
upon the available data.  (Id., ¶
7.)  Plaintiff contends that the
Settlement Amount of $180,000.00—approximately 14.83% of that potential
recovery—is an excellent result.  (Id.)
 
The Court finds the $180,000.00 settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate considering Plaintiff’s PAGA
claims, Defendant’s potential defenses, possible reductions in any eventual
PAGA award, and the posture of this case.  (Kullar
v. Foot Locker Retail, Inc. (2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 116, 130 (“The most
important factor is the strength of the case for plaintiffs on the merits,
balanced against the amount offered in settlement.”).) The $180,000.00 settlement provides
genuine and meaningful relief consistent with the purpose of PAGA.  (Moniz, supra, 72 Cal.App.5th at 77 (“a
trial court should evaluate a PAGA settlement to determine whether it is fair,
reasonable, and adequate in view of PAGA's purposes to remediate present labor
law violations, deter future ones, and to maximize enforcement of state labor
laws.”).) 
 
Plaintiff
requests attorneys’ fees in the amount of $60,000.00, or one-third of the
Settlement Amount, and $11,617.16 in costs. The fees and costs are supported by the declaration of attorney Simon
Yang, who indicates Plaintiff’s
lodestar attorneys’ fees are $74,475 based on an hourly rate of $750 per
hour for 99.3 total hours.  (Yang Decl., ¶¶ 11, 17-19, Exhs. 2, 3.) The
proposed fees and costs are acceptable under the common fund doctrine and are
significantly less than the pre-multiplier lodestar amount. (Consumer Privacy Cases (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 545, 557; Laffitte v. Robert Half Internat. Inc.
(2016) 1 Cal.5th 480, 503.)  Considering
the work completed by Plaintiff’s counsel to bring about this PAGA settlement,
(e.g., legal research, discovery, damages analysis, mediation, etc.), the Court
finds that the attorney fees and costs are reasonable.
 
RULING
Accordingly, the Motion
is GRANTED. 
 
Plaintiff shall provide the LWDA with a copy of this
order within 10 days.  (Lab. Code § 2699
subd. (s)(3) (“A copy of the superior court’s judgment in any civil action
filed pursuant to this part and any other order in that action that either
provides for or denies an award of civil penalties under this code shall be
submitted to the agency within 10 days after entry of the judgment or
order.”).)
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
 
Dated this 24th day of October 2024
