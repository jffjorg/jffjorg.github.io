MOVING
PARTY: Defendant/Cross-Complainant REVEL MANAGEMENT GROUP, LLC (“Revel”)
                                    
RESPONDING
PARTY: Cross-Defendants HUGO VILLASENOR (“Villasenor”), ALEXANDRA DEL SALTO
(“Del Salto”), and THE MUSE AGENCY LLC (“Muse”) (collectively, “Cross-Defendants”)
 
            The Court has considered the moving,
opposition and reply papers.
 
BACKGROUND
            This action arises out of a business
relationship.  On June 6, 2022, Plaintiff
Villasenor initiated this action against Defendants Roberto Banuelos Jr. and
Revel (collectively, “Defendants”).  The
First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) was filed on September 16, 2022.  
 
            On August 14, 2023, Defendants filed
a Motion for Summary Judgment (“MSJ”) with regard to the FAC, which was granted
by the Court in its entirety in an Order dated June 14, 2024.
 
            On February 15, 2024, Revel filed a
cross-complaint (“Cross-Complaint”) against Villasenor, Del Salto and Muse.  Villasenor filed an answer to the
Cross-Complaint on March 18, 2024, while Del Salto and Muse filed their answer
to the Cross-Complaint on April 10, 2024.
 
            Revel filed a demurrer to Villasenor’s
answer to the Cross-Complaint on March 28, 2024, and a demurrer to Del Salto
and Muse’s answer to the Cross-Complaint on April 17, 2024.
 
On June 27, 2024, Cross-Defendants
jointly filed their First Amended Answer to the Cross-Complaint.  As a result, Revel’s initial demurrer to
Cross-Defendants’ respective answers was moot and taken off the calendar.  
 
On July 5, 2024, Revel filed
the present Demurrer to Cross-Defendants’ First Amended Answer to
Cross-Complaint (the “Demurrer”).  On
October 11, 2024, Cross-Defendants filed an opposition, and Revel filed a reply
on October 17, 2024.
 
MEET AND CONFER
The meet and confer
requirement has been met. 
 
DISCUSSION
Legal
Standard
Where pleadings are
defective, a party may raise the defect by way of a demurrer.  (Coyne v. Krempels (1950) 36 Cal.2d
257, 262.) When considering a demurrer, a court reads the allegations stated in
the challenged pleading liberally and in context, and “treat[s] the demurrer as
admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions
or conclusions of fact or law.”  (Serrano
v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584, 591.) 
 
A demurrer to an answer may
be appropriate if “[t]he answer does not state facts sufficient to constitute a
defense [or] [t]he answer is uncertain.” 
(Code Civ. Proc., § 430.20, subds. (a), (b).) 
 
Ultimate facts are generally
sufficient, rather than evidentiary matters or legal conclusions.  (Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42
Cal.4th 531, 550.)  
 
Even where a defense is
defectively pled, it may be allowed if the answer gives sufficient notice to
enable the plaintiff to prepare to meet the defense, in part because defenses
not pled are waived.  (Harris v. City
of Santa Monica, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 240.)
 
Here, Cross-Defendants
asserted 38 affirmative defenses in their First Amended Answer.  Revel demurs to all but the 15, 18th, 24th,
25th, and 38th affirmative defenses, based on the ground that the subject
defenses all fail to state facts sufficient to constitute a defense, which
therefore, renders these defenses uncertain, ambiguous, and unintelligible.
 
While there are no
evidentiary facts alleged in the First Amended Answer, the cardinal rule of
pleading is that only the ultimate facts need to be alleged.  (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28
Cal.App.3d 714, 719.)  The “‘distinction
between conclusions of law and ultimate facts is not at all clear and involves
at most a matter of degree. [Citations.] For example, the courts have permitted
allegations which obviously included conclusions of law and have termed them
“ultimate facts” or “conclusions of fact.”’”  (Perkins v. Superior Court (1981) 117
Cal.App.3d 1, 6.)  
 
Most importantly, the
sufficiency of an answer depends on the complaint to which it purports to
answer.  (South Shore Land Co. v.
Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 733.) 
Even where an answer is entirely bare of facts, it is read with
reference to the facts alleged in the complaint or cross-complaint.  Thus, Revel’s contention that each of the
identified affirmative defenses fails to state facts in support thereof is not,
strictly speaking, correct.
 
The Court has reviewed the First
Amended Answer and finds that it fairly apprises Revel of the alleged
affirmative defenses.  As pled, the
defenses are sufficient to withstand demurrer. 
(Khoury v. Maly’s of California Inc. (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612,
616 [“A demurrer for uncertainty is strictly construed, even where a complaint
is in some respects uncertain, because ambiguities can be clarified under
modern discovery procedures.”].)  Any
uncertainty as to the facts underlying Cross-Defendants’ affirmative defenses
can be clarified in discovery; specifically, Cross-Defendants can provide
further details to Form Interrogatory 15.1, as parties have, in fact, so
stipulated during the recent October 11, 2024 Informal Discovery Conference
held by the Court, where Cross-Defendants were ordered to serve full, complete
responses to Form Interrogatory 15.1. 
 
Unverified affirmative
defenses, by their nature, are necessarily asserted at the beginning of the
case and out of an abundance of caution because the failure to assert an
affirmative defense may constitute a waiver and cannot always be pled in
detail.  (Vitkievicz v. Valverde
(2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1306, 1314; Code Civ. Proc., §430.80 (a).)
 
RULING
Accordingly, the Demurrer is
overruled in its entirety.
 
Parties who intend
to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
