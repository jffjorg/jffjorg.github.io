MOTIONS TO BE RELIEVED AS COUNSEL

Dept. 56
 
 



 
BACKGROUND
            On January 23, 2023, Plaintiff Lil
Nubbins Neighborhood, LLC initiated this action against Defendants William
Messori (“Messori”) and WE-BAAM, Inc. (“We-Baam”) (collectively, “Defendants”).  The complaint asserts the following causes of
action: (1) breach of fiduciary duty; (2) negligence; (3) negligent
misrepresentation; and (4) fraud and deceit.
 
            Counsel for Defendants, Michael H.
Wallenstein of Wolf  Wallenstein, PC
(“Counsel”), is seeking to withdraw as counsel for both Defendants, and has
filed two separate motions to be relieved as counsel (collectively, the
“Motions”) on September 26, 2024.  The
Motions are compliant with California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362.  The Motions are unopposed.  Trial is currently set for January 27, 2025. 
 
DISCUSSION
The court has discretion on whether to allow an
attorney to withdraw, and a motion to withdraw will not be granted where
withdrawal would prejudice the client. (Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21
Cal.App.4th 904, 915.)  Withdrawal is
generally permitted unless there is a compelling reason to continue the
representation.  (Heple v. Kluge
(1951) 104 Cal.App.2d 461, 462.)  
 
In connection with the Motions, Counsel declares, as
ground for the Motions, that “communication between counsel and We-Baam’s sole
officer, Mr. Messori, has ceased and counsel has not heard from the client for
many weeks despite repeated requests” and that “both We-Baam and Mr. Messori
have been delinquent in making payments for legal services in this matter and
have not cooperated with providing information needed for the conduct of the
litigation.”
 
The
Court finds that the Motions set forth adequate bases for withdrawal. The
Court, therefore, GRANTS the Motions. The Court notes that while Messori can
appear in propria persona, We-Baam must appear by counsel and cannot defend
itself at trial without being represented by counsel. The Court will, therefore,
hold an OSC regarding We-Baam’s representation by counsel on November 25, 2024,
at 8:30 a.m. in this Department. 
 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.            
 
Parties
who intend to submit on this tentative must send an email to the Court at
SMC_DEPT56@lacourt.org as directed by the instructions provided on the court
website at www.lacourt.org.  If the
department does not receive an email and there are no appearances at the
hearing, the motion will be placed off calendar.
 
Dated this 24th day of October 2024
