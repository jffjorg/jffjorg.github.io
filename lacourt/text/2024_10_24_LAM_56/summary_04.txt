And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted motions filed by Counsel, Michael H. Wallenstein, to withdraw as counsel for Defendants William Messori and We-Baam, Inc. Counsel has not communicated with the clients for several weeks and has not received payments for legal services. The judge finds that the motions set forth adequate bases for withdrawal and notes that while Messori can represent himself, We-Baam must appear by counsel at trial. The court will hold an OSC regarding We-Baam's representation by counsel on November 25, 2024.
