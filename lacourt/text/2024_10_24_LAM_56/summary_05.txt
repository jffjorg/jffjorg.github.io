And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the petition to withdraw funds from a blocked account filed by Soledad Weaver, as guardian ad litem for Antonio Rosales, who is deceased. The petition seeks to withdraw the remaining balance of $11,176.01 and close out the account. The court finds that the request is improper because the petitioner has not submitted the purported power of attorney or a certified copy of the death certificate of the plaintiff. Additionally, the court notes that heirs of the deceased incompetent person have a right to intervene in the administration of the account and requires that the petitioner provide a declaration regarding the probate proceeding or the heirs of the deceased plaintiff. Therefore, the petition is denied without prejudice and the moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling.
