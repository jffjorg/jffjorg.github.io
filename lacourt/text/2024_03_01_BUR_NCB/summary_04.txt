And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by EAN Holdings, LLC, a defendant in a motor vehicle accident case. The plaintiff, Anabella Dary Mendoza, alleges that the defendant, Crystal Marie Navarrette, was operating a motor vehicle rented from Enterprise Rent-A-Car when the accident occurred. The plaintiff also alleges that EAN Holdings, LLC was employed by Navarrette and entrusted the vehicle to her.

The Judge has sustained the demurrer filed by EAN Holdings, LLC, meaning that the complaint does not state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action against the company. The Judge has given the plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint to address the concerns raised by EAN Holdings, LLC.

The Judge has also denied EAN Holdings, LLC's request for judicial notice of certain documents, including the Statement of Information for EAN Holdings, LLC and Enterprise Rent-A-Car. The Judge has taken judicial notice of the documents only to the extent that they are public records filed with the California Secretary of State.

The Judge has not made a factual determination at this time that EAN Holdings, LLC was not negligent in entrusting the vehicle to Navarrette. Instead, the Judge has left open the possibility that the plaintiff may be able to amend the complaint to allege facts that would impose liability on EAN Holdings, LLC as a rental car business.
