And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Rashyn R. Reynolds v. Hillsides and Dr. Kimberly Charlton. Hillsides filed a demurrer to the plaintiff's third amended complaint (TAC), arguing that the allegations do not meet the legal requirements for a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. The judge has sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, meaning the plaintiff cannot re-file the complaint with additional allegations. The judge also denied Hillsides' alternative request to dismiss the action for failure to prosecute, as the demurrer is sustained. The judge's ruling is based on the legal principles outlined in several California court cases, including Vasquez v. Franklin Mgmt. Real Estate Fund, Inc. and Christensen v. Superior Court.
