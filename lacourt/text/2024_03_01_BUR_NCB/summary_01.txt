Significant Statements:
  - "For the most part, English objected to the RPDs that they sought irrelevant information, were not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, they were overbroad as to time/scope, they were unduly burdensome and oppressive, and the RPDs seek privileged and confidential information that is a trade secret, financial information, or private."
  - "Moving Parties argue that RPDs are necessary to ascertain whether English and the affiliated entities are alter egos of the other."
  - "Once the moving party has shown good cause for production, the burden shifts to the responding party to justify its objections."
```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court grants the motion to compel further responses to the Request for Production of Documents filed by the plaintiffs. The motion seeks to compel defendant Aneaka English to provide additional information in response to the request for production, which includes information about her finances, corporate meetings, communications, and affiliations with other entities. The court finds that the objections raised by English to the request for production are without merit and that the request is necessary to determine whether English and the affiliated entities are alter egos of the other. As a result, the court orders English to provide further responses within 30 days of notice of this order. The court also awards monetary sanctions against English in the amount of $2,000, plus $60 in filing fees, for failing to comply with her discovery obligations.
