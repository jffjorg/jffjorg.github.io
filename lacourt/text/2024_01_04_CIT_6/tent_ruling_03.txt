 Case Number:  23PSCV01364    Hearing Date:   January 4, 2024    Dept:  6 Plaintiff
LVNV Funding LLC’s Request for Entry of Default Judgment 
Defendant: Ji Kim 
TENTATIVE RULING
Plaintiff’s request for entry of default
judgment is GRANTED in the reduced amount of $31,932.53. 
BACKGROUND
This is
a collection case. Plaintiff LVNV Funding LLC (Plaintiff) is a debt collector. The
originator of the underlying debt, Cross River Bank, sold the debt to Sherman
Originator III, LLC, who sold the debt to Sherman Originator, LLC, who then
sold the debt to Plaintiff. Plaintiff filed this action on May 5, 2023,
alleging two causes of action for breach of contract and open book account
against Defendant Ji Kim (Defendant) and Does 1 through 10. Plaintiff filed a
default judgment package on July 10, 2023, which was later denied without
prejudice. 
On
January 2, 2024, Plaintiff resubmitted the default judgment package.
LEGAL
STANDARD
Code of
Civil Procedure section 585 permits entry of a default judgment after a party
has filed to timely respond or appear. (Code Civ. Proc., § 585.) A party
seeking judgment on the default by the court must file a Request for Court
Judgment, and: (1) a brief summary of the case; (2) declarations or other
admissible evidence in support of the judgment requested; (3) interest
computations as necessary; (4) a memorandum of costs and disbursements; (5) a
proposed form of judgment; (6) a dismissal of all parties against whom judgment
is not sought or an application for separate judgment under Code of Civil
Procedure section 579, supported by a showing of grounds for each judgment; (7)
exhibits as necessary; and (8) a request for attorneys’ fees if allowed by statute
or by the agreement of the parties. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1800.) 
ANALYSIS
Plaintiff
seeks default judgment against Defendant in the total amount of $43,532.03
including $30,105.85 in damages, $11,599.50 in interest, $1,293.18 in attorney
fees, and $533.50 in costs. The Court notes that this default judgment package
does not address the issues raised in the Court’s prior order denying the
request for entry of default judgment. (Order re Tentative Ruling (10/11/23).)
Specifically, Plaintiff has not addressed the fact that New Jersey law governs
the underlying loan agreement at issue. (Compl., ¶ 24; see Airs Aromatics,
LLC v. CBL Data Recovery Technologies Inc. (2020) 50 Cal.App.5th 1009, 1014
[contract containing New York choice-of-law clause held to govern the
plaintiff’s recovery of prejudgment interest].) Plaintiff simply resubmitted
the same default judgment package as before, only with additional interest, and
did not explain whether Plaintiff’s prejudgment interest calculation complies
with New Jersey law. Accordingly, the Court disregards Plaintiff’s prejudgment
interest calculation. 
            The
Court otherwise finds Plaintiff’s default judgment package to be adequate and
will GRANT Plaintiff’s request for entry of default judgment in
the reduced amount of $31,932.53.
