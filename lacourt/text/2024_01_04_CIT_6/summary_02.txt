And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The tentative ruling denies the motion to quash subpoenas and/or for protective orders filed by non-party Zeming Qi. The court finds that Qi's arguments are unpersuasive and that the subpoenas are not overly broad or unreasonable. The court notes that Qi did not provide a declaration with personal knowledge that Qi is the sole shareholder of Lightking America Technology (L.A.) LTD and doubts that Qi's attorney has the personal knowledge necessary to state such a fact. The court also finds that Qi's status as the sole shareholder does not confer upon Qi a reasonable expectation of privacy. Therefore, the court denies the motion to quash subpoenas and orders the plaintiffs to give notice of the court's ruling within five calendar days.
