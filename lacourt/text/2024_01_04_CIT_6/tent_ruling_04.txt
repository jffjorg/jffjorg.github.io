 Case Number:  23PSCV02505    Hearing Date:   January 4, 2024    Dept:  6 CASE NAME:  Joanna Juarez v.  Sequoia Janai Williams Motion to be Relieved as Counsel  TENTATIVE  RULING The Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED on the condition  that Counsel submits a revised proposed order as directed herein.  Counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file proof of  service of same within five calendar days.  BACKGROUND This is a motor vehicle accident case. On August 16, 2023, plaintiff  Joanna Juarez (Plaintiff) filed this action against defendant Sequoia Janai  Williams (Defendant) and Does 1 through 15, alleging causes of action for motor  vehicle and general negligence.  On  December 6, 2023, Vivan F. Yochelson of Yochelson & Associates filed a  motion to be relieved as counsel. The motion is unopposed.  LEGAL  STANDARD The Court has discretion to allow an attorney to withdraw, and such a motion should be granted, provided that there is no prejudice to the client, and it does not disrupt the orderly process of justice. (See Ramirez v. Sturdevant (1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 904, 915; People v. Prince (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 398, 403-407.) A motion to be relieved as counsel must be made on Judicial Council  Form MC-051 (Notice of Motion and Motion), MC-052 (Declaration), and MC-053  (Proposed Order). (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, subds. (a), (c), (e).) The requisite forms must be served “on the client and on all  parties that have appeared in the case.” (Cal. Rules of Court, Rule 3.1362,  subd. (d).)  DISCUSSION Vivan  F. Yochelson of Yochelson & Associates (Counsel) seeks to be relieved as  counsel for Plaintiff. Counsel contends there has been a breakdown in the  attorney-client relationship. (Yochelson Decl., ¶ 2.)  The Court finds this to be sufficient grounds for permitting  withdrawal. A breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is grounds for  allowing the attorney to withdraw. (Estate of Falco (1987) 188  Cal.App.3d 1004, 1014.) Other grounds for permitting an attorney to withdraw  from representation include the client’s conduct that “renders it unreasonably  difficult for the lawyer to carry out the representation effectively[.]” (Cal.  Rules of Professional Conduct, rule 1.16, subd. (b)(4).)  Counsel has provided the appropriate Judicial Council forms,  namely forms MC-051, MC-052, and MC-053. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1362,  subds. (a), (c), (e).) Counsel has also provided proof of personal service of  these documents. (Proof of Service (12/11/23).) The Court notes that Counsel’s  declaration did not include the Case Management Conference as a future hearing,  but the Court will need to continue the Case Management Conference to permit  Plaintiff time to retain new counsel. The Court will require Counsel to submit  a revised proposed order with the future Case Management Conference hearing  date and information, as well as a telephone number for the client in paragraph  6, and the persons appearing at the hearing in paragraph 2.  Therefore, the Court GRANTS the motion to be relieved as counsel  on the condition that Counsel submits a revised proposed order as directed  herein.  CONCLUSION The Motion to be Relieved as Counsel is GRANTED on the condition  that Counsel submits a revised proposed order as directed herein.       Counsel is ordered to give notice of this ruling and file proof of service of same within five calendar days.
