The Plaintiff seeks entry of default judgment in the amount of $43,532.03, which includes damages, interest, attorney fees, and costs. However, the Judge notes that the Plaintiff's default judgment package does not address the issues raised in the Court's prior order denying the request for entry of default judgment, specifically the application of New Jersey law to the underlying loan agreement. As a result, the Judge disregards the Plaintiff's prejudgment interest calculation and grants the Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment in the reduced amount of $31,932.53.
