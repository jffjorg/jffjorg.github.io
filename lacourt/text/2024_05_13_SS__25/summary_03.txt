Summary:
The Judge has made a tentative ruling to grant Smith's motion to vacate the judgment entered by the California Court. The Judge finds that the judgment in the Nevada Action was void for lack of personal jurisdiction because Smith was never properly served with the summons and complaint. The Judge also finds that the California Court has no jurisdiction over the case. The Judge orders the moving party to give notice.
