ANALYSIS 
 
I.          Legal Standard & Discussion  
 
A.    
Determination of “Abandoned Mobilehome”
—Civ. Code § 798.61(a)(1)¿ 
 
Pursuant to Civil Code, section 798.61, subdivision (a)(1),
an “‘abandoned mobilehome’ means a mobilehome about which all of the following
are true:¿ 
¿ 
(A) It is
located in a mobilehome park on a site for which no rent has been paid to the
management for the preceding 60 days.¿ 
(B)  It is
unoccupied.¿ 
(C)  A
reasonable person would believe it to be abandoned.¿ 
(D) It is
not permanently affixed to the land.” 
 
(Civ. Code, § 798.61(a)(1)(A)-(D).) 
Here, Petitioner submits the declaration of Veronica
E. Reeves, Park Manager for Petitioner. Ms. Reeves explains that Respondents
are the registered owners of the mobilehome currently occupying 600 W Gladstone
Sp 74, Azusa, California 91702. (Reeves Decl., ¶ 4; Ex. “2.”) The mobilehome
located at the aforementioned address is currently unoccupied and has been
unoccupied prior to November 15, 2023, the date the 30 day Notice was posted on
the mobilehome. (Reeves Decl., ¶ 5; Ex. “1.”) The 30 day Notice of Belief of
Abandonment was posted on the mobilehome pursuant to Civil Code Section
798.61 on November 15, 2023 and sent via certified mail on the same day. The
mobilehome is not permanently affixed to the space. (Reeves Decl., ¶ 6; Ex. “1.”) Further, Petitioner submits the supplemental
declaration of Ms. Reeves to show that the mobilehome can be defined as
abandoned. The declaration provides: no rent for space rent has been paid since
September 2022; Respondents have not been seen at the premises and no one else
has been seen or reported to be occupying the mobilehome; other residents have
not reported seeing anyone at the mobilehome since it was abandoned; utility
usage reflects minimum base charges; Respondents, including any representative,
agent, executor, governmental agencies or otherwise, have not contacted Ms.
Reeves’ office; the mobilehome is not in any way attached to any permanent
footings or foundations at space 74. (Reeves Supp. Decl., ¶¶ 4-7.)  
Based on the foregoing, the Court finds the
Mobilehome falls within the Section 798.61 definition of “abandoned.”
 
B.     Notice
of Belief of Abandonment—Civ. Code § 798.61(b) 
 
Civil Code, section 798.61, subdivision (b)
requires:¿ 
 
After determining a mobilehome in a mobilehome park to be an abandoned
mobilehome, the management shall post a notice of belief of abandonment on the
mobilehome for not less than 30 days, and shall deposit copies of the notice in
the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the homeowner at the last
known address and to any known registered owner, if different from the
homeowner, and to any known holder of a security interest in the abandoned
mobilehome. This notice shall be mailed by registered or certified mail
with a return receipt requested.  
 
(Civ. Code, § 798.61(b).) 
 
As provided above, Petitioner’s Park Manager declares the Notice of Belief of Abandonment was posted on the
mobilehome pursuant to Civil Code Section 798.61 on November 15, 2023 and sent
via certified mail on the same day. (Reeves Decl., ¶¶
5-6; Ex. “1.”) Petitioner provides Proof of Service that the Notice of Belief
of Abandonment was mailed as such with return receipt requested. (POS 3/25/24;
Ex. “3.”)  
 
Thus, Petitioner has complied with Civil Code section
798.61(b).  
  
 
C.     Petition
for Judicial Declaration—Civ. Code § 798.61(c)¿ 
¿ 
Civil Code section 798.61, subdivision (c)(1) states
that: 
 
Thirty
or more days following posting pursuant to subdivision (b), the management may
file a petition in the superior court in the county in which the mobilehome
park is located, for a judicial declaration of abandonment of the mobilehome. A
proceeding under this subdivision is a limited civil case. Copies of the
petition shall be served upon the homeowner, any known registered owner, and
any known person having a lien or security interest of record in the mobilehome
by posting a copy on the mobilehome and mailing copies to those persons at
their last known addresses by registered or certified mail with a return
receipt requested in the United States mail, postage prepaid. 
 
(Civ. Code, §
798.61(c).)  
 
Petitioner has provided Proof of Service indicating that
the petition was served on the homeowners by posting on the mobilehome and by
mailing copies to the interested parties last known address with return receipt
requested. (POS 3/25/24.) 
 
Thus, the Court finds the service requirements under Civil
Code section 798.61(c) have been satisfied. 
 
 
D.    Charges,
Attorney’s Fees, and Costs¿ 
¿ 
Civil Code section 798.61, subdivision (d)(2) provides
that:¿ 
 
If, at
the hearing, the petitioner shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the
criteria for an abandoned mobilehome has been satisfied and no party
establishes an interest therein at the hearing and tenders all past due rent
and other charges, the court shall enter a judgment of abandonment, determine
the amount of charges to which the petitioner is entitled, and award attorney's
fees and costs to the petitioner.  
 
(Civ. Code, §
798.61(d)(2).) 
 
Petitioner seeks monthly storage charges in the
amount of $621.91 per month owed from September 2020. (Petition ¶ 6; Reeves Decl., ¶ 7.) As evidence, Petitioner submits a copy of the September
2020 statement showing the $621.91 per month storage charge that Respondents
were paying. (Id.) Ms. Reeves declares that the
monthly storage costs is reasonable and is calculated from September 1, 2020
for 43 months, which totals $26,742.13. (Reeves Decl., ¶¶ 7-9.) Petitioner additionally seeks the
total amount of rent and other applicable charges due on the mobile home site
as of the date of judgment, storage cost equal to the rent due and other
applicable charges from the date of judgment up to the date of the sale of the
mobilehome or other disposition, court cost, and other relief that the Court
deems just and proper. (Prayer ¶¶ 2-6.) 
 
No amount of costs or
attorney’s fees is sought or supported by the evidence. Therefore, costs and
attorney’s fees, if any, are to be determined by memorandum of costs and
noticed motion, respectively. However,
costs of $225 were listed in the request for entry of default. 
 
Accordingly, judgment to be entered in Petitioner’s favor in the amount
of $26,967.13 ($26,742.13 plus $225).  
 
II.        Conclusion 
 
The Petition for Declaration of Abandonment of Mobilehome
is GRANTED. Judgement for Abandonment is entered in favor of the Petitioner and against the Respondents in the
amount of $26,967.13. 
 
Moving party is ordered to give notice.
