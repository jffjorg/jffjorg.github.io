And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Altman v. Gillon, granting the defendant's motion to set aside and vacate the default and default judgment. The defendant, Gillon, had moved to set aside the default and default judgment, arguing that he lacked actual notice due to improper service. The court found that the substituted service of the summons and complaint did not provide Gillon with actual notice, as the doorman who accepted the documents on behalf of Gillon did not have authority to accept them. The court also noted that Gillon's declaration stating he was never served on April 17, 2023, was credible. Given the strong public policy in favor of resolving matters on the merits, rather than through default, the court granted the defendant's motion to set aside and vacate the default and default judgment, and ordered the defendant to file a responsive pleading within 15 court days.
