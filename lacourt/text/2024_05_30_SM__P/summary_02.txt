And here is the English text summary:

This tentative ruling addresses a motion to expunge a notice of lis pendens filed by defendants Pacific Shangrila LLC and ILU LLC. The defendants argue that the complaint does not contain a real property claim that would affect the title or possession of the properties. The plaintiff, Huynh, argues that the complaint asserts a real property claim through a quiet title cause of action. However, the court finds that the plaintiff's claim is based on a claim for interest in the LLCs, not the properties themselves, and fails to establish the probable validity of the real property claim. The court grants the defendants' motion to expunge the lis pendens.
