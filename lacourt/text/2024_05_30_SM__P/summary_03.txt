And here is the English-text summary:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the defendant's demurrer to the plaintiffs' first amended complaint and motion to strike. The defendant, Dr. Sands, argues that the lawsuit is time-barred under CCP § 340.5, as the plaintiffs changed the date in the complaint to plead around the statute of limitations. However, the court finds that this is an improper basis for a demurrer and that the defendant's reliance on the statute of limitations is mistaken. The court also denies the defendant's motion to strike paragraphs 36 and 37 of the complaint, which mention settlement communications, as these communications do not constitute a settlement discussion or offer. The defendant must file an answer within 10 court days.
