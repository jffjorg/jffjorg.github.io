Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has tentatively ruled that Defendant's demurrer to the Plaintiff's complaint is sustained without leave to amend. The judge has determined that the Plaintiff was exempt from minimum wage requirements based on the facts alleged in the complaint. The Plaintiff had signed an employment contract with a set base salary and was paid a signing bonus and a non-discretionary bonus. The judge has concluded that the Plaintiff's construction of the term "exempt" is circular and unsupported by case law, and that the Plaintiff was indeed exempt from minimum wage requirements. Therefore, the judge has sustained the demurrer and denied the Plaintiff leave to amend the complaint.
