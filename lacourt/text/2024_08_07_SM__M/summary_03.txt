And here is the English text summarizing the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge has granted the motion for leave to amend the complaint filed by Plaintiff Jane SP Doe. The proposed Second Amended Complaint will add two new causes of action: Elder abuse and Failure to Report. The judge found that the plaintiff demonstrated good cause for leave to amend and that there is no substantial prejudice stemming from the amendment. The defendants did not oppose the motion and therefore did not identify any prejudice they would suffer as a result of granting leave to amend. The trial is not set, and the judge has granted the motion.
