LEGAL STANDARD 
 
A demurrer for sufficiency tests whether
the complaint states a cause of action. (Hahn v. Mirda (2007) 147
Cal.App.4th 740, 747.) When considering demurrers, courts read the allegations
liberally and in context. In a demurrer proceeding, the defects must be
apparent on the face of the pleading or via proper judicial notice. (Donabedian
v. Mercury Ins. Co. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 968, 994.) A demurrer tests the
pleadings alone and not the evidence or other extrinsic matters. Therefore, it
lies only where the defects appear on the face of the pleading or are
judicially noticed. (CCP §§ 430.30, 430.70.) At the pleading stage, a plaintiff
need only allege ultimate facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of the
factual basis for the claim against him. (Semole v. Sansoucie (1972) 28
Cal. App. 3d 714, 721.) A “demurrer does not, however, admit contentions,
deductions or conclusions of fact or law alleged in the pleading, or the
construction of instruments pleaded, or facts impossible in law.” (S. Shore
Land Co. v. Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 732, internal citations
omitted.) 
 
A special demurrer for uncertainty is
disfavored and will only be sustained where the pleading is so bad that
defendant cannot reasonably respond—i.e., cannot reasonably determine what
issues must be admitted or denied, or what counts or claims are directed
against him/her. (CCP § 430.10(f); Khoury v. Maly’s of Calif., Inc.
(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 612, 616.) Moreover, even if the pleading is somewhat
vague, “ambiguities can be clarified under modern discovery procedures.” (Ibid.)  
 
“Liberality in permitting amendment is
the rule, if a fair opportunity to correct any defect has not been given.” (Angie
M. v. Superior Court (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1217, 1227.) It is an abuse of
discretion for the court to deny leave to amend where there is any reasonable
possibility that plaintiff can state a good cause of action. (Goodman v.
Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 349.) The burden is on plaintiff to show¿in
what manner¿plaintiff can amend the complaint, and¿how¿that
amendment will change the legal effect of the pleading.¿(Id.) 
 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
Defendant Boris Dobrin demurs to the
first cause of action for failure to pay all wages and overtime wages (Lab.
Code §§ 1182.12, 1194, and 1197) as claimed in the operative Second Amended
Complaint (SAC). Defendant argues that this cause of action fails as a matter
of law because Plaintiff’s original Complaint and FAC alleged facts which
showed that Plaintiff was an exempt employee. 
 
Even without the application of the
sham pleading doctrine, the SAC still presents affirmative facts showing that
Plaintiff was exempt. Persons “employed in [an] administrative, executive, or
professional [capacity]” are exempt from the minimum wage provisions. (Lab.
Code § 515; 8 CCR §§ 11010-11040, 11060-11150.) To be exempt as an executive,
an employee must (a) have duties and responsibilities involve the management of
the enterprise in which he/she is employed or of a customarily recognized
department or subdivision thereof; (b) customarily and regularly direct the
work of two or more other employees; (c) have the authority to hire or fire
other employees or whose suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring or
firing and as to the advancement and promotion or any other change of status of
other employees will be given particular weight; (d) customarily and regularly
exercises discretion and independent judgment; (e) be primarily engaged in
duties which meet the test of the exemption; and (f) earn a monthly salary
equivalent to no less than two (2) times the state minimum wage for full-time
employment. (8 CCR § 11040(1)(A)(1).)
 
The SAC and prior complaints expressly
alleged facts showing that Plaintiff was an “exempt” employee. Plaintiff’s work
and agreed-upon compensation met the criteria for an executive exemption. Each
pleading sets forth that Plaintiff was employed by the Defendants beginning on
August 2019 until June 2020, as a chief operations officer and was owed
a set base salary that was not subject to fluctuations. Plaintiff signed
an employment contract that stipulated a three thousand dollar ($3,000.00)
signing bonus to be paid in two installments every fifteen days from the start
date of August 1, 2019. The employment contract offered a base salary of three
thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per month with an increase to one hundred and
thirty thousand dollars ($130,000.00) per year after the first year. (Ex. A.)
The contract also required payment of a “sign-on bonus” of three thousand
dollars ($3,000.00) in two (2) installments, every fifteen (15) days from
Plaintiff’s start date. (Id.) Additionally, Plaintiff was to be paid a
non-discretionary bonus representing 15% of the gross commission from all
brought in and closed deals. As such, on April 20, 2020, Plaintiff was owed one
hundred and twenty thousand dollars ($120,000.00) for eight months of work from
August 2019 to April 2020 and would be paid a fixed salary of fifteen thousand
dollars ($15,000.00) per month for future work. (Ex. B.) All of these terms
show that Plaintiff earned a set salary more than 2 times the state minimum
wage. 
 
Plaintiff argues that Defendant
“willfully misclassified Plaintiff as an exempt employee” by failing to pay his
salary as agreed. (SAC, ¶¶ 1-52.) Plaintiff argues that, although
he was admittedly hired as an “exempt employee” (Odenbreit Decl., ¶6), he was
non-exempt because Defendants failed to pay him above a minimum wage. Plaintiff
contends that an employer must “actually pay the employee” above minimum wage
in order to be “exempt” from the payment of the state minimum wage. This
construction is patently circular and would render the term “exempt”
meaningless. Essentially, there would be no “exempt” status because any time an
exempt employee is paid less than the minimum wage, they would immediately cease
to be exempt. Furthermore, this construction is unsupported by Plaintiff’s
cited case law. (See Semprini v. Wedbush Sec., Inc., (2020) 57 Cal. App.
5th 246 [as a matter of first impression, compensation structure based solely
on commissions with recoverable draw against future commissions did not
satisfy salary basis test for administrative exemption to overtime laws]; Negri
v. Koning & Associates (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 392, 395-396 [an
insurance claims paid $29 per hour, with no minimum guarantee, and no overtime,
did not meet the definition of “salary” under the administrative exemption,
even though it exceeded double the minimum wage, because his pay “var[ied]
according to the amount of time he put in”]; cf. Kettenring v. Los Angeles
Unified Sch. Dist., (2008) 167 Cal. App. 4th 507, 513-514 [teachers were exempt
when paid a predetermined rate “not subject to reduction” based on
variations in quantity of work, calculated by multiplying a flat rate by the
number of classroom hours taught].)
 
Based on the above facts, Plaintiff
was exempt from the minimum wage requirements. 
Accordingly, Defendant’s demurrer is
SUSTAINED without leave to amend.
