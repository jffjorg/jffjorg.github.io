Summary:

The tentative ruling grants the special motion to strike the complaint filed by Tameka Renee Crosland against Quality Loan Service Corporation, et al. The ruling finds that the complaint arises from protected activity and lacks even minimal merit. The court concludes that the lack of distribution of surplus funds by the defendants was done in furtherance of their constitutional right to petition the court and discharge Quality from liability. The court also finds that the plaintiff has failed to provide prima facie evidence that she has a probability of prevailing on her claim over the distribution of the surplus funds. As a result, the complaint is stricken, and the defendants are awarded attorney fees and costs.
