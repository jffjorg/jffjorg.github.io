  Case Number:  22STCV19039    Hearing Date:   May 30, 2024    Dept:  55 NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS:
Demurrer of Defendant County of Los Angeles. Motion Thereof to Strike.
 
The unopposed demurrer is sustained, without leave to
amend, based upon all of its page numbers. Code Civ. Proc., § 472d (as to
demurrer rulings, statements of decision may consist of references to
appropriate page numbers).
The unopposed motion to strike is granted, without
leave to amend, for the reasons stated.
The Court grants Defendant’s unopposed request for
judicial notice, there being no filed objection. Gentry v. eBay, Inc.
(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 816, fn. 9.
BACKGROUND
PAUL BUTAKOV (“Plaintiff”), a self-represented
litigant, filed a Complaint for Medical Negligence, alleging that, in June
2020, Plaintiff underwent vessel coronary artery bypass at HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL,
and thereafter experienced a clicking noise in his chest, which thereafter was
discovered to be an improperly closed chest plate by doctors at KECK MEDICAL
CENTER OF USC.
On 2/14/24, the Court set an OSC Re: Dismissal for
Failure to Serve Defendants County of Los Angeles (“Defendant”) and Maxwell
Johnson for 5/16/24. The Court discharged the OSC after Defendant filed a demurrer
and motion to strike the Complaint. Although Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal
on 2/13/24, it does not involve Defendant or any stay pending appeal. See,
e.g., Young v. Tri-City Healthcare Dist. (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 35, 51
(“‘In determining whether a proceeding is embraced in or affected by the
appeal, we must consider the appeal and its possible outcomes in relation to
the proceeding and its possible results.’”). Plaintiff has not filed an
opposition to Defendant’s demurrer and motion to strike. 
LEGAL STANDARD
Demurrers are to be sustained where a pleading fails
to plead adequately any essential element of the cause of action. Cantu v.
Resolution Trust Corp. (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 857, 879-880.
The grounds for a motion to strike are that the
pleading has irrelevant, false or improper matter, or has not been drawn or
filed in conformity with laws. Code Civ. Proc., § 436.
ANALYSIS
First, Defendant demurs to the Complaint because (1)
Plaintiff alleged no County involvement, (2) Plaintiff failed to allege any statutory
cause of action, as required for suing a public entity, (3) Plaintiff untimely
presented a government claim, and (4) any claims related to treatment in June
2020 are time-barred under Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5’s one-year
statute of limitations.
Second, Defendant moves to strike allegations of
prejudgment interest, because it is unauthorized against a public entity, as
provided in Civil Code section 3291.
            Claims
Against Defendant
If the body of the pleading completely fails to
mention a defendant, then it is insufficient to state a cause of action
notwithstanding some generalized allegations. Falahati v. Kondo (2005)
127 Cal.App.4th 823, 829
Here, the Complaint lacks any factual allegation as to
the Defendant, but instead mentions other defendants shown by judicial notice
not to be associated with Defendant. E.g., Complaint, ¶ 22.
Hence, the Court sustains the demurrer as to this
issue.
            Statutory
Claims Against Public Entities
“‘[T]o state a cause of action against a public
entity, every fact material to the existence of its statutory liability must be
pleaded with particularity.’" Lopez v. S. Cal. Rapid Transit Dist.
(1985) 40 Cal.3d 780, 795.  
Here, the Complaint lacks any allegations of statutory
elements against Defendant, a public entity.
Therefore, the Court sustains the demurrer as to this
issue.
 
            Government
Claims Timeliness
The “failure to allege facts demonstrating or excusing
compliance with the [government claim timeliness] requirement subjects a
complaint to general demurrer for failure to state a cause of action.” State
of Cal. v. Sup. Ct. (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1234, 1240-1244. For purposes of
calculating time limits for a government claim, the date of action accrual is
the same date of accrual pursuant to the applicable statute of limitations. Loehr
v. Ventura County Cmty. College Dist. (1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 1071, 1078.
Government Code section 911.2 states a six-month deadline for filing a
government claim.  Willis v. City of
Carlsbad (2020) 48 Cal.App.5th 1104, 1121.
The instant Complaint lacks any allegation about the
government claims requirement but such allegations are required as against Defendant,
a government entity.
Thus, the Court sustains the demurrer as to this
issue.
Statute Of
Limitations  
“[T]o prevail on a demurrer based on the statute of
limitations, a defendant must establish the entire cause of action is
untimely.” Pointe San Diego Residential Community, L.P. v. Procopio, Cory,
Hargreaves & Savitch, LLP (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 265, 274. “[S]uits
against health care providers for professional negligence must be filed within
one year.” Gutierrez v. Tostado (2023) 97 Cal.App.5th 786, 790 (citing
Code Civ. Proc., § 340.5).
On 11/29/22 and 12/5/22, the Court had overruled other
demurrers addressing the statute of limitations. But here Plaintiff failed to
oppose Defendant’s demurrer, and so Plaintiff effectively waived any objection
as to the issue. The failure to file a proper and timely opposition in trial
court creates a waiver of the issues on any appeal. Cabrini Villas
Homeowners Assn. v. Haghverdian (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 683, 693.
So, the Court sustains the demurrer as to this issue.
            Prejudgment
Interest
“A general prayer in the complaint is adequate to
support an award of prejudgment interest”, and ‘[n]o specific request for
interest need be included in the complaint….’” North Oakland Medical Clinic
v. Rogers (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 824, 829. However, a public entity is not
liable for prejudgment interest. Civ. Code § 3291.
Plaintiff admits that Defendant, “is a government
entity,…” Complaint, ¶ 3. Therefore, the prayer allegation about prejudgment
interest is unauthorized as to Defendant that is a governmental entity.
Thus, the Court grants the motion as to this issue.
 
CONCLUSION
The Court sustains the unopposed demurrer and grants
the unopposed motion to strike, without leave to amend.
