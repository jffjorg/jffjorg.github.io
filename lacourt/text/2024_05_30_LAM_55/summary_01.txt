And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge's tentative ruling is a summary of the Court's decision on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the Defendant, County of Los Angeles. The Plaintiff, Paul Butakov, filed a Complaint for Medical Negligence alleging that he underwent a vessel coronary artery bypass at Huntington Hospital in June 2020 and subsequently experienced a clicking noise in his chest which was later discovered to be an improperly closed chest plate by doctors at Keck Medical Center of USC.

The Court sustained the demurrer based on several grounds, including the lack of County involvement, failure to allege any statutory cause of action, untimely presentation of a government claim, and claims related to treatment in June 2020 being time-barred. The Court also granted the motion to strike allegations of prejudgment interest as it is unauthorized against a public entity.

The Court granted Defendant's unopposed request for judicial notice, and the Plaintiff did not file an opposition to the demurrer and motion to strike. The Court sustained the demurrer and granted the motion to strike without leave to amend.
