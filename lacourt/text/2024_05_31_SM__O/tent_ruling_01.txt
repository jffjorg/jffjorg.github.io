TENTATIVE
RULING
            Defendants
Prosight Specialty Insurance and New York Marine and General Insurance Special
Motion To Strike Under CCP § 425.16 (Anti-SLAPP) as to all causes of action in Plaintiff
Aziz Alaoui’s FAC is GRANTED.  Defendants
meet their burden to establish Plaintiff’s claims arise from protected
activity. Plaintiff does not meet his burden to show a probability of
prevailing on his claims. The Court orders the 1st–8th
causes of action in the Plaintiff’s FAC stricken as to Defendants Prosight
Specialty Insurance and New York Marine and General Insurance. Defendants are
entitled to attorney fees and costs as the prevailing party on their motion
pursuant to CCP ¶ 425.16(c)(1) to be heard and decided in separate motion. 
 
            Defendants’
RJN is GRANTED.
 
            Defendants’
Evidentiary Objections to the Declaration of Hess Panah in Support of Plaintiff’s
Opposition are SUSTAINED.
  
“Litigation of
an anti-SLAPP motion involves a two-step process. First, the moving defendant
bears the burden of establishing that the challenged allegations or claims
arise from protected activity in which the defendant has engaged.  Second,
for each claim that does arise from protected activity, the plaintiff must show
the claim has “at least minimal merit.  If the plaintiff cannot make this
showing, the court will strike the claim.”  (Bonni v. St. Joseph Health
System (2021) 11 Cal.5th 995, 1009 [where moving party seeks to strike an
entire cause of action alleging multiple factual bases, court does not
determine whether 1st step is met based on “gravamen” test; but
rather must determine whether each factual bases supplies the element of claim
or merely provides context].)  The Court will grant the motion
"if the plaintiff fails to produce evidence to substantiate his claim or
if the defendant has shown that the plaintiff cannot prevail as a matter of
law." (Siam v. Kizilbash (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1563, 1570.)
 
“The anti-SLAPP statute is broadly
construed.” (Lunada Biomedical v. Nunez (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 459, 469,
citing Briggs v. Eden Council for Hope & Opportunity (1999) 19
Cal.4th 1106, 1121–1122; Equilon Enterprises, LLC v. Consumer Cause,
Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 60, fn. 3 [“The Legislature's 1997 amendment of
the statute to mandate that it be broadly construed apparently was prompted by
judicial decisions ... that had narrowly construed it to include an overall
‘public issue’ limitation.”].) 
 

Anti-SLAPP
     First Prong – Defendants Burden of Establishing Claims Arise From
     Protected Activity. 

 
In the first prong of the
anti-SLAPP analysis, “courts are to consider the elements of the challenged
claim and what actions by the defendant supply those elements and consequently
form the basis for liability.  The defendant’s burden is to identify what
acts each challenged claim rests on and to show how those acts are protected
under a statutorily defined category of protected activity.”  (Bonni,
supra, 11 Cal.5th at p. 1009.)
 
“First, the moving defendant must
show that the challenged claim or claims arise from the defendant's
constitutionally protected free speech or petition rights. (Ojjeh v. Brown
(2019) 43 Cal.App.5th 1027, 1035.) A defendant has the “burden of identifying
all allegations of protected activity” on the 1st prong of
SLAPP.”  (Bel Air Internet, LLC v. Morales (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th
924, 936-937.)  Defendant only meets this burden by demonstrating that the
act underlying the plaintiff’s cause of action “fits one of the categories
spelled out in section 425.16, subdivision (e).”  (Sprengel v. Zbylut
(2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 140, 150.)
 
            Defendants
Prosight Specialty Insurance (“Prosight”) and New York Marine and General
Insurance (“New York,” collectively the “Defendants”) move to strike Plaintiff
Aziz Alaoui’s (“Alaoui”) First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) pursuant to CCP §
425.16 (Anti-SLAPP) arguing that Alaoui’s claims arise from statements or
writings made in connection with the underlying litigation at issue in the
matter. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd., (e)(2) [“act in furtherance of a
person's right of petition or free speech under the United States or California
Constitution in connection with a public issue includes: . . . any written or
oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration
or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other official
proceeding authorized by law.].) 
 
            The
Defendants argue the lawsuit at bar arises from a personal injury action,
entitled Aziz Alaoui v Yevgisiy Vaynerman, filed by Alaoui on March 27,
2018, Case No. BC699545 (the “Underlying Litigation”), which was dismissed on
3-6-20, and Alaoui’s Motion to Set Aside Dismissal was denied due to multiple
factual inaccuracies. (Warshaw Decl., ¶¶ 4–13, 18; RJN, Ex. A–I, O.) The
Defendants state Alaoui signed a statutory offer to compromise on 11-17-21
which was executed on behalf of the Defendants “over 24 months earlier,” Alaoui
filed a motion to enforce a settlement agreement and enter judgment which was
denied by the Court on 12-21-21, followed by Alaoui’s eventual filing of the
complaint in this matter on 9-13-23. (Warshaw Decl., ¶¶ 16–21; RJN Ex. M–Q.)
The Defendants argue all causes of action, and every fact alleged in the FAC, arose
out of, or were statements or writings made in further of the litigation in the
Underlying Litigation. (Motion, pp. 13–14; see FAC, ¶¶ 4, 5, 6, 9, 46(a)–(d))
 
            The
Court finds that the Defendants have successfully demonstrated that all facts
alleged in the FAC, or the acts underlying Alaoui’s FAC, arise out of protected
speech in furtherance of the litigation in the Underlying Litigation pursuant
to CCP § 425.16(e)(2). 
 
 
   
II.         
Anti-SLAPP
Second Prong – Plaintiff Does Not Meet His Burden to show a probability of
prevailing on their claims
 
Once
defendant demonstrates that a cause of action arises from protected conduct,
the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient
and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a
favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is
credited.  (Navellier v. Sletten (2002) 29 Cal.4th 82,
88–89.)  “Precisely because the statute (1) permits early intervention in
lawsuits alleging unmeritorious causes of action that implicate free speech
concerns, and (2) limits opportunity to conduct discovery, the plaintiff's
burden of establishing a probability of prevailing is not high: We do not weigh
credibility, nor do we evaluate the weight of the evidence. Instead, we accept
as true all evidence favorable to the plaintiff and assess the defendant's
evidence only to determine if it defeats the plaintiff's submission as a matter
of law.  Only a cause of action that lacks ‘even minimal merit'
constitutes SLAPP.”  (Overstock.com, Inc. v. Gradient Analytics, Inc.
(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 688, 699.)
 
“The
second prong of the statute deals with whether the plaintiff has “demonstrated
a probability of prevailing on the claim.  Under section 425.16,
subdivision (b)(2), the superior court, in making these determinations,
considers ‘the pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the
facts upon which the liability or defense is based.’ For purposes of an
anti-SLAPP motion, the court considers the pleadings and evidence submitted by
both sides, but does not weigh credibility or compare the weight of the
evidence. Rather, the court's responsibility is to accept as true the evidence
favorable to the plaintiff.  A plaintiff need only establish that his or
her claim has minimal merit to avoid being stricken as a SLAPP.  With
these descriptions in mind, we will not strike a cause of action under the
anti-SLAPP statute unless it lacks even minimal merit.”  (Ralphs
Grocery Co. v. Victory Consultants, Inc. (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 245, 261.)
 
The
“probability of prevailing” is tested by the same standard governing a motion
for summary judgment, nonsuit, or directed verdict.  Thus, in opposing a
SLAPP motion, it is plaintiff's burden to make a prima facie showing of facts
that would support a judgment in plaintiff's favor.  (Crossroads
Investors, L.P. v. Federal National Mortgage Assn. (2017) 13
Cal.App.5th 757, 785; Taus v. Loftus (2007) 40 Cal.4th 683, 714 [a
“summary-judgment-like procedure”].)  
 
            Here,
Alaoui electronically filed a late opposition to the Defendant’s SLAPP Motion
on 4-25-24 at 5:34 p.m. The opposition does not address the probability of
prevailing on the claims, nor does Alaoui provide any evidence to support the
claims. Given Alaoui's complete failure to submit any evidence to support the
factual allegations of his FAC or the facts recited in his opposition, Alaoui
has failed to meet his burden to show even a minimal probability of prevailing
on the claims. 
 
In addition, Defendants show that
the litigation privilege is a complete bar to all of Alaoui’s causes of action.
 (Motion, pp. 18–19.) “[T]he [litigation] privilege applies to any communication
(1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants or other
participants authorized by law; (3) to achieve the objects of the litigation;
and (4) that have some connection or logical relation to the action.” (Silberg
v. Anderson (1990) 50 Cal.3d 205, 212, as modified (Mar. 12, 1990);
see Kashian v. Harriman (2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 892, 913 [“Any doubt about
whether the privilege applies is resolved in favor of applying it.”].) 
 
“Civil
Code section 47, subdivision (b)(2), promotes the effectiveness of judicial
proceedings by encouraging attorneys to zealously protect their clients'
interests. [I]t is desirable to create an absolute privilege ... not because we
desire to protect the shady practitioner, but because we do not want the honest
one to have to be concerned with [subsequent derivative] actions....
[Citation.]” (Knoell v. Petrovich (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 164, 171,
citations omitted; see Cal. Civ. Code § 47(b)(4) [protecting any “publication
or broadcast” made in in the course of a “judicial proceeding”].) 
 
            The
Court finds that all the elements of the litigation privilege are met: (1) the
allegations against the Defendants relate to statements or writing made in the
Underlying Action (See FAC, ¶¶ 1–15, 17, 23); (2) the Defendants engaged the Defense
counsel for Defendant Vaynerman and were participants in the Underlying Litigation
(Motion, p. 18.); (3) the statements and writings identified by Alaoui
were made to achieve the objects of the Underlying Action (Warshaw
Decl., ¶¶ 4–13; RJN, Ex. A–I); (4) the statements and writings identified by
Alaoui have a connection and logical relation to the Underlying Action. (See FAC, ¶¶ 1–15, 17, 23; see also Warshaw Decl., ¶¶
4–13; RJN, Ex. A–I).  
 
            Alaoui
argues that Defendants’ SLAPP motion was filed late and thus should be denied
as time barred pursuant to CCP § 425.16(f). (See Oppo., p. 9.) CCP § 425.16(f)
states, “The special motion may be filed within 60 days of the service
of the complaint or, in the court's discretion, at any later time upon
terms it deems proper.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, emphasis added.) Prosight
timely filed the SLAPP motion since they were served on 10-31-23, and filed the
SLAPP on 1-2-24, within 60 days, adjusting for Holidays and Weekends. (See Panah
Decl., Ex. 5.) Defendants concede that New York did not file the SLAPP motion
within 60 days of service of the original complaint on 8-24-23, however New
York did timely file the SLAPP after service of the FAC on 12-28-23. (Warshaw
Decl., ¶ 23.) Additionally, Alaoui provides no arguments to show prejudice from
New York’s late filing from service of the Complaint, New York provides
adequate explanation for the late filing, the motion was filed within two
months of the permissive 60-day deadline, and the lawsuit is still in the
“early stages of the proceedings.” (San Diegans for Open Government v. Har
Construction, Inc. (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 611, 624 [“In determining whether
to permit a late motion, the most important consideration is whether the filing
advances the anti-SLAPP statute's purpose of examining the merits of covered
lawsuits in the early stages of the proceedings”]; see also Platypus Wear,
Inc. v. Goldberg (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 772, 783 [hearing a late SLAPP
motion was improper where “the delay [of over two years] was extreme”, the
explanation was “weak” and the parties had already completed substantial discovery].)  Thus, the Court finds
that Prosight’s SLAPP was timely filed, and the Court has the discretion to
hear New York’s SLAPP motion pursuant to CCP § 425.16(f).

            Therefore, because the
litigation privilege applies, and Alaoui has not presented any facts other than
the pleadings, the Court finds that Alaoui has not met his burden to show a probability
of prevailing on the claims against the Defendants. 
 
            The Defendants
SLAPP Motion is GRANTED. All causes of action against Defendants are stricken
from the FAC. Defendants are entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to
CCP § 425.16(c)(I) to be decided upon a separate motion. 
 5-31-24
23SMCV02449  Defendant Yevgisiy Vanermanui Motion to Set aside Default Defendant
Yevgisiy Vaynerman's Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default is GRANTED pursuant
to CCP § 473.5. Defendant filed this motion on 5-6-24. Plaintiff filed an
opposition on 5-22-24, and a reply was filed on 5-24-24. Plaintiff Aziz Alaoui
("Alaoui") claims to have served Defendant Yevgisiy Vaynerman
("Vaynerman") on both 8-27-23 and 1-14-24. both by substitute
service, at 4610 Densmore Avenue in Encino, CA 91436 ("4610
Densmore"). (Motion, Nemanpour Decl., pp 6:27–7:1–5; Ex. 2, 3.) Vaynerman
declares that he was not properly served since Vaynerman had not resided at
4610 Densmore since 2021, Vaynerman currently resides with his mother in West
Hollywood, and Vaynerman does not "receive any personal mail" at 4610
Densmore or list 4610 Densmore as a place of business. (Vaynerman Decl., ¶¶
10–13; Johnson Decl., ¶¶ 26–28) Vaynerman declares that on 4-8-24
Vaynerman authorized attorney William Johnson ("Johnson") represent
Vaynerman in the action at issue, and accept service for Vaynerman. (Vaynerman
Decl., ¶16; Johnson Decl., ¶ 23.) Johnson declares he made numerous efforts to
inform Alaoui's counsel of Vaynermnan's representation on 4-8-24, 4-10-24, and
4-11-24 but received no response from opposing party. (Johnson Decl., ¶¶ 29–32;
Ex. C–E.)  
Alaoui's
lack of warning to opposing counsel regarding the intention to seek default
once the opposing counsel's identity was known on 4-8-24, the lack of proper
service on Vaynerman, and the timely filing of the motion to vacate on 5-6-24
after receiving no notice of the 4-10-24 entry of default are undisputed. (See Shapell Socal Rental Properties, LLC v. Chico's FAS, Inc. (2022) 85 Cal.App.5th 198, 203, as modified (Oct.
31, 2022), as modified on denial of reh'g (Nov. 15, 2022) ["An
attorney has both an ethical and statutory obligation to warn opposing counsel,
if counsel's identity is known, of an intent to seek a default and to give
counsel a reasonable opportunity to file a responsive pleading"]; see also
Cal. Civ. Code § 583.130 [“It is the policy of the state that a plaintiff shall
proceed with reasonable diligence in the prosecution of an action but that all
parties shall cooperate in bringing the action to trial or other
disposition.”].) Thus, because Vaynerman did not receive actual notice prior to
the default being entered against him on 4-10-24, this motion to vacate was
filed within a "reasonable time" after the default's discovery, and
responsive pleadings have been filed with the court on 6-27-24 and 8-27-24, the
Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default is GRANTED pursuant to CCP § 473.5.
