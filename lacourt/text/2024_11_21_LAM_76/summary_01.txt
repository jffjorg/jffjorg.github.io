And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer to the Complaint. The demurrer is sustained with leave to amend as to the first and fourth causes of action, and overruled as to the second, third, fifth, sixth, and eighth causes of action. The first cause of action for fraud and deceit is overruled because the plaintiff has not alleged the required specificity of facts showing how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were made. The second cause of action for quiet title is overruled because it is not inconsistent with the fraud claim. The third cause of action for slander of title is overruled because the alleged recording of a grant deed constitutes slander of title. The fourth cause of action for conversion is sustained with leave to amend because real property cannot be the subject of conversion. The fifth cause of action for declaratory relief is overruled because it is not affected by the other claims. The sixth cause of action for cancellation of quitclaim deed is overruled because it is a proper cause of action. The seventh cause of action for notary misconduct is sustained without leave to amend because it cannot be asserted against non-notary defendants. The eighth cause of action for recovery of notary public bond is overruled because it is not affected by the other claims. The plaintiff is given 30 days' leave to amend the Complaint.
