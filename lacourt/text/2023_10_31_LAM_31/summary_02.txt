```

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees. The plaintiff had argued that the defendant's anti-SLAPP motion was frivolous and intended to cause delay. However, the judge found that the anti-SLAPP motion was brought due to its potential merit and was not frivolous. The judge noted that the Court of Appeal had reversed and remanded the decision, finding that the plaintiff's evidence created a possible inference of the defendant's willful blindness, which is probative of actual malice. The judge also found that the Court of Appeal's published decision is one of only a handful in which a court has found sufficient evidence of willful blindness to support a claim under the constitutional actual malice standard. As such, the judge could not find that the anti-SLAPP motion was frivolous or brought to cause delay.
