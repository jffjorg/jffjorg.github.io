And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge continues the hearing on the plaintiff's motion to compel the defendant's further responses to form interrogatories and special interrogatories. The Judge orders the parties to engage in a serious effort to meet and confer prior to the hearing, taking into account the principles of relevance, discovery, and attorney-client privilege. The Judge finds that the parties have not engaged in a serious effort to meet and confer, and that the defendant's responses to interrogatories are not adequate. The Judge orders the parties to submit a joint statement of special interrogatories that remain in dispute at least 10 court days prior to the hearing. The hearing is continued to April 30, 2024.
