And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling denying Defendant Parmida's motion to compel further responses and production of documents from Plaintiff Amcor Lighting, Inc. dba Jiao Guang USA Group. The dispute arises from Defendant's demand for production of documents related to Plaintiff's efforts to mitigate damages, as well as various other requests related to Defendant's cross-complaint for false advertising and unfair competition.

The court finds that Plaintiff has complied with the document requests, but Defendant is dissatisfied with the responses, arguing that they are incomplete or nonresponsive. The court notes that Plaintiff is not obligated to produce documents that may exist but are not in its possession, and that Defendant has not shown why it is entitled to different answers.

The court also rules that Defendant bears the burden of costs associated with inspecting exemplars in China, as the demanding party. Finally, the court concludes that Plaintiff's responses to requests related to Defendant's cross-complaint are sufficient, and that Defendant's requests for more information are not supported by the Code of Civil Procedure.

The court's tentative ruling will be considered at the hearing on March 26, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.
