BACKGROUND
 
This case arises from a dispute between homeowners and their building
contractor.  Plaintiffs Lauren Entner
Nabi and Ryan Nabi (“Plaintiffs”) hired Defendants Paragon Marketing &
Consulting Inc. dba Paragon Builders, a California Corporation and dba Paragon
Builders (“Paragon”) and Guy Liba (“Liba”) (together, “Defendants”) in July
2023 to convert Plaintiffs’ garage into an accessory dwelling unit
(“ADU”).  
 
On May 2, 2024, Plaintiffs filed suit against Defendants, alleging
four causes of action for (1) breach of contract; (2) negligence; (3) negligent
misrepresentation; and (4) unfair business practices.
 
On June 28, 2024, Defendants filed a complaint against Plaintiffs,
case number 24SMCV03159, alleging seven causes of action for (1) breach of
contract; (2) foreclosure of mechanic’s lien; (3) open book account; (4)
account stated; (5) quantum meruit; (6) unfair business practices; and (7)
prompt payment penalties, arising from the same dispute concerning the same
July 2023 agreement to convert Plaintiffs’ garage to an ADU.
 
The actions, 24SMCV02065 and 24SMCV03159, were related on September
17, 2024.
 
Plaintiffs now move to consolidate both actions for all purposes.  The motion is unopposed.
 
ANALYSIS
 
Procedural Requirements
 
            Per Local Rule 3.3, subdivision (g),
“Cases may not be consolidated unless they are in the same department.  A motion to consolidate two or more cases may
be noticed and heard after the cases, initially filed in different departments,
have been related into a single department, or if the cases were already
assigned to that department.”  (Super.
Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 3.3(g)(1).) 
Once the Court relates the cases, the Court may consolidate the actions
and order a joint trial on matters that “involve[e] a common question of law or
fact.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 1048, subd.
(a).)
 
            Both cases were related on September
17, 2024, and are currently pending before the same department.  Therefore,
the Court finds no procedural hurdles to consolidation.
 
            Substantive
Requirements
 
Code of Civil Procedure
section 1048, subdivision (a) provides:
 
When actions involving a
common question of law or fact are pending before the court, it may order a
joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue in the actions; it
may order all the actions consolidated and it may make such orders concerning
proceedings therein as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.
            
            Both
cases involve the same dispute among the same parties, concerning the same July
2023 agreement for Defendants to convert Plaintiffs’ garage to an ADU.  Thus, both cases will inevitably involve
common questions of law and fact.  
            
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants Plaintiffs’ unopposed motion to
consolidate Nabi v. Liba (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2024, No. 24SMCV02065)
with Paragon v. Nabi (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2024, No. 24SMCV03159).    
 
The Court further orders that the cases are consolidated for all
purposes and Nabi v. Liba (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2024, No.
24SMCV02065) is designated as the lead case per California Rules of Court, rule
3.350(b).  The Court further orders that
all proceedings and hearing dates in Paragon v. Nabi (Super. Ct. L.A.
County, 2024, No. 24SMCV03159) are vacated.
 
            Plaintiffs shall provide notice of
the Court’s ruling and file the notice with a proof of service forthwith.
