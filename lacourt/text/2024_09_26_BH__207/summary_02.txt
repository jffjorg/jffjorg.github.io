And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The court has sustained the demurrer to the first, second, and third causes of action without leave to amend, and sustained the demurrer to the fourth and fifth causes of action with leave to amend. The court has granted Boladian leave to amend the breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty claims. The court has ordered Boladian to file and serve a second amended cross-complaint within 30 days.

The court has found that the cross-complaint does not state a cause of action for indemnity against the plaintiff who has sued Boladian, as it would create the nonsensical result that a successful plaintiff would have to pay its own recovery. The court has also found that the cross-complaint does not state a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty because there is no evidence of a fiduciary relationship between the parties.

The court has granted leave to amend the breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty claims because Boladian can add additional allegations to support her claims. However, the court has emphasized that the burden is on the plaintiff to show in what manner the complaint could be amended and how the amendment would change the legal effect of the complaint.
