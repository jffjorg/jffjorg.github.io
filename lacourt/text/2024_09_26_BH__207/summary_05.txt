And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling granting the unopposed motion to consolidate two cases: Nabi v. Liba (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2024, No. 24SMCV02065) and Paragon v. Nabi (Super. Ct. L.A. County, 2024, No. 24SMCV03159). The cases involve the same dispute among the same parties, concerning the same July 2023 agreement for conversion of a garage into an accessory dwelling unit (ADU). The Judge finds that both cases will inevitably involve common questions of law and fact, and therefore consolidates the cases for all purposes. The lead case is designated as Nabi v. Liba, and all proceedings and hearing dates in Paragon v. Nabi are vacated.
