And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The Court has reviewed the demurrer and motions to strike filed by Defendant Harold Weiner in response to the Complaint filed by Plaintiff Michael Wolf, an individual doing business as Aquatic Life Service Co. The Court has determined that the Complaint adequately alleges four causes of action: breach of oral contract, promissory estoppel, promissory fraud, and declaratory relief.

The Court finds that the parties entered into an oral agreement for the sale of Defendant's book of business, and that Defendant breached that agreement by selling the book of business to a third party. The Court also finds that Plaintiff reasonably relied on Defendant's promise to sell the book of business and that Plaintiff has been damaged as a result of the breach.

The Court overrules Defendant's demurrer to the Complaint and denies Defendant's motion to strike. The Court orders Defendant to file and serve an Answer to the Complaint on or before October 18, 2024. The Court also continues the Case Management Conference to January 27, 2025, at 8:30 A.M. in Department 207.
