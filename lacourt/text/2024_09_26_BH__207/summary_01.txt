Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend the complaint without prejudice due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with the procedural requirements of Rule 3.1324. The plaintiff seeks to add nine new causes of action to the complaint, including allegations of race discrimination, violation of the Unruh Act, and unfair competition. The court has previously denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to amend and granted the defendant's demurrer to the complaint.

The plaintiff has provided two declarations outlining the proposed amendments, but the court finds that the declarations do not fully comply with the requirements of Rule 3.1324. Specifically, the court notes that the proposed amendments are not accurately redlined and do not demonstrate what allegations are proposed to be deleted from the complaint.

The court concludes that it cannot analyze whether the proposed amendments are necessary and proper without a complete and accurate redline or other recitation of all proposed additions and deletions. Therefore, the court denies the motion without prejudice and orders the plaintiff to provide notice of the court's ruling and file the notice with proof of service forthwith.
