ANALYSIS
 
Motion to Compel
 
“In California, discovery may
be obtained from a nonparty through an oral deposition, a written deposition,
or a deposition for the production of business records and things. (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2020.010, subd. (a).)” (Board of Registered Nursing v. Superior
Court of Orange County (2021) 59 Cal.App.5th 1011, 1030 (“Board of
Registered Nursing”).) “To pursue the deposition of a nonparty, a party must
generally serve a deposition subpoena.” (Ibid.).)
 
“‘A deposition subpoena that
commands only the production of business records for copying shall designate
the business records to be produced either by specifically describing each
individual item or by reasonably particularizing each category of item, and
shall specify the form in which any electronically stored information is to be
produced, if a particular form is desired.’ [Citation.]” (Board of
Registered Nursing, supra, 59 Cal.App.5th at p. 1030.)
 
“‘If a deponent fails to
answer any question or to produce any document, electronically stored
information, or tangible thing under the deponent’s control that is specified
in the deposition notice or a deposition subpoena, the party seeking discovery
may move the court for an order compelling that answer or production.’ (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd. (a).)” (Board of Registered Nursing, supra,
59 Cal.App.5th at p. 1031.) “‘[D]iscovery conducted by
way of a business records subpoena is a
“deposition.”’ [Citation.]” (Id. at pp. 1031-1032.) “If a subpoena
requires the attendance of a witness or the production of books, documents,
electronically stored information, or other things before a court, or at the
trial of an issue therein, or at the taking of a deposition, the court, upon
motion reasonably made by [a party or a witness] . . . may make an order . . .
directing compliance with it upon those terms or conditions as the court shall
declare, including protective orders.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 1987.1.)
 
            Taylor
is a podcast host for Defendant PodcastOne, Inc. (Ex. C. to Cardinal
Decl.)  As such, Taylor may have
information concerning whether PodcastOne is illegally using 516 N. Beverly
Drive as a corporate office and/or event space. 
 
 
            On
June 25, 2024, Plaintiffs personally served Taylor with a deposition subpoena
for personal appearance and for production of documents, with a deposition/production
date of July 19, 2024.  (Ex. A to
Cardinal Decl.)  In addition to a
personal appearance for deposition, the subpoena requested the following
documents:
 
DEMAND FOR PRODUCTION NO. 1: All DOCUMENTS referring to podcasts YOU
participated in that were filmed or recorded at 516 N. Beverly Dr., Beverly
Hills, CA 90210. 
 
DEMAND FOR PRODUCTION NO. 2: All COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and
LiveOne, Inc. or anyone acting on its behalf since June 26, 2023. 
 
DEMAND FOR PRODUCTION NO. 3: All COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and
Racquel Elissa Goldman a/k/a “Racquel Goldy” since June 26, 2023. 
 
DEMAND FOR PRODUCTION NO. 4: All COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and
Chelsea Briggs since June 26, 2023. 
 
DEMAND FOR PRODUCTION NO. 5: All COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and Aidan
Crotinger since June 26, 2023. 
 
DEMAND FOR PRODUCTION NO. 6: All COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and Joshua
Hallbauer since June 26, 2023. 
 
DEMAND FOR PRODUCTION NO. 7: All DOCUMENTS sufficient to identify the
PERSON who paid YOU to participate in podcasts filmed or recorded at 516 N.
Beverly Dr., Beverly Hills, CA 90210. 
 
DEMAND FOR PRODUCTION NO. 8: All DOCUMENTS sufficient to identify the
PERSON who contracted with YOU to participate in podcasts filmed or recorded at
516 N. Beverly Dr., Beverly Hills, CA 90210. 
 
DEMAND FOR PRODUCTION NO. 9: All DOCUMENTS sufficient to show the date
and PERSON interviewed for any interview YOU have conducted at 516 N. Beverly
Dr., Beverly Hills, CA 90210. 
 
DEMAND FOR PRODUCTION NO. 10: All COMMUNICATIONS referring to the
pre-Grammy event hosted at 516 N. Beverly Dr., Beverly Hills, CA 90210 on
February 3, 2024. 
 
DEMAND FOR PRODUCTION NO. 11: All COMMUNICATIONS referring to the LVO
Podcast events hosted at 516 N. Beverly Dr., Beverly Hills, CA 90210 on March
28, 2024 and April 27, 2024. 
 
DEMAND FOR PRODUCTION NO. 12: All DOCUMENTS reflecting payments to
YOU, including paystubs, invoices and checks, for work performed at 516 N.
Beverly Dr., Beverly Hills, CA 90210. 
 
DEMAND FOR PRODUCTION NO. 13: All COMMUNICATIONS between YOU and any
PERSON referring to 516 N. Beverly Dr., Beverly Hills, CA 90210 since June 26,
2023. 
 
DEMAND FOR PRODUCTION NO. 14: All DOCUMENTS sufficient to show the
date, PERSON interviewed and address for any interview YOU have conducted for
LiveOne, Inc. or LiveXLive Media, Inc. 
 
DEMAND FOR PRODUCTION NO. 15: All DOCUMENTS and COMMUNICATIONS
referring to the LiveOne House or 516 N. Beverly Dr., Beverly Hills, CA 90210
since June 26, 2023.
 
(Ibid.)  Taylor
did not appear for the deposition as scheduled. 
(Ex. B to Cardinal Decl.)
 
Therefore, Plaintiffs have met their burden to demonstrate that they
are entitled to the requested deposition and documents and neither Defendants
nor Taylor have opposed the motion or demonstrated otherwise.[1]
 
Sanctions
 
            “The
court shall impose a monetary sanction under Chapter 7 (commencing with Section
2023.010) against any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or
opposes a motion to compel an answer or production, unless it finds that the
one subject to the sanction acted with substantial justification or that other
circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.480, subd.
(j).)  
 
            Here,
Taylor did not oppose the motion to compel. 
Therefore, mandatory sanctions under section 2025.480, subd. (j) are not
warranted.  Further, the Court notes that
Plaintiffs seek monetary sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section
1987.1, subdivision (a).  But that
section does not authorize the issuance of monetary sanctions.   (See Notice of Motion.)  
 
            Plaintiffs
also seek sanctions for misuse of the discovery process.  Code of Civil Procedure section 2023.030
provides, “To the extent authorized by the chapter governing any particular
discovery method or any other provision of this title, the court, after notice
to any affected party, person, or attorney, and after opportunity for hearing,
may impose the following sanctions against anyone engaging in conduct that is a
misuse of the discovery process:
(a) The court may impose a monetary sanction
ordering that one engaging in the misuse of the discovery process, or any
attorney advising that conduct, or both pay the reasonable expenses, including
attorney’s fees, incurred by anyone as a result of that conduct.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2023.030, subd.
(a).)  
 
            Misuses
of the discovery process include “Failing to respond or submit to an authorized
method of discovery.”  (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2023.010, subd. (d).)  But Article 4
(sections 2025.410-2025.480) does not authorize sanctions for misuse of the
discovery process.[2]
 
            Therefore,
the Court finds Plaintiffs’ request for monetary sanctions to be faulty.
 
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants in part Plaintiffs’ motion to compel compliance
with the subject subpoena, and orders non-party Jason Michael Cauchi, aka Jax
Taylor to comply with the subject subpoena within 20 days of the notice of the
Court’s order, unless Plaintiffs stipulate otherwise.  Further, the Court denies Plaintiffs’ request
for monetary sanctions as procedurally defective.   
 
Plaintiffs shall provide notice of the Court’s order and file the
notice with a proof of service forthwith.
