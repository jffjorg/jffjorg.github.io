And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has tentatively ruled that the demurrer filed by the defendants, Yusheng Shew and Jill Van, is sustained with 30 days leave to amend. The judge finds that the First Amended Complaint filed by the plaintiffs, Gevork Voskanian, Mary Keryan, and KSJV3, Inc., fails to state sufficient facts to constitute a cause of action in several causes of action, including breach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud and deceit, negligent misrepresentation, declaratory relief, intentional interference, and negligent interference. The judge also finds that the breach of implied covenant claim appears to rely on the same facts as the defective breach of contract claim. The judge grants the defendants 30 days to amend their demurrer and warns the parties to comply with the filing deadlines.
