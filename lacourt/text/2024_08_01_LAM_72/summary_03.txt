Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied ExpertVoice, Inc.'s motion to compel arbitration and dismiss the lawsuit brought by Miguel A. Licea. The judge found that ExpertVoice failed to show that Licea had agreed to the arbitration agreement by using its website. The judge determined that the website's terms of service were not conspicuous and did not put a reasonably prudent person on inquiry notice. As a result, the judge denied ExpertVoice's motion and allowed the lawsuit to proceed.
