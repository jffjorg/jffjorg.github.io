Background
 
This is an insurance dispute. The following facts are taken
from the parties’ separate statements. 
 
Plaintiff issued insurance policy SC20030826 to Greenify
effective March 10, 2020 to March 10, 2021 (the “Policy”). (Undisputed Fact
(“UF”) 1.) The Policy is a business auto insurance policy that provides
liability coverage for claims against the insured. (UF 2.) Coverage is limited
to scheduled automobiles operated by scheduled drivers. (UF 3.)
 
Angie Sandoval is the CEO of Greenify. (Sandoval Decl. ¶ 1.)
Sandoval was always the person responsible for purchasing Greenify’s insurance.
(UF 19.) When Sandoval applied for the Policy, she scheduled driver Gary Shain
on the Policy. (UF 20.) The Policy reflects that Gary Strain is the only
scheduled driver. (Caffey Decl., Ex. A, DEF000007.) Sandoval does not recall if
she notified Plaintiff of any other drivers that were to be scheduled on the
Policy. (UF 21.) No one else at Greenify would have notified Plaintiff of any
other scheduled drivers. (UF 22.) The Policy reflects that two vehicles were
scheduled: a 2010 Kenworth heavy truck, and a 2020 non-owned trailer. (Caffey
Decl., Ex. A, DEF000006.)
 
Greenify contracted with Amazon Logistics for transportation
and delivery of goods. (UF 26.) Amazon Logistics is an additional insured on
the Policy. (UF 15, 16.)
 
Greenify subcontracted some of its transportation and
delivery services to Good Brother’s, L.L.C. (“Good Brother’s”). (UF 24-25.)
 
On July 23, 2020, an automobile collision occurred between
another vehicle and a truck operated by Good Brother’s on behalf of Greenify.
(UF 44-46, 50.) At the time of the accident, the Good Brother’s truck was
operated by Defendant Calvin Everhart. (UF 44-46.) The collision resulted in
Everhart’s death and serious bodily injury to Defendant Luis Valdes. 
 
On September 24, 2020, Valdes filed a personal injury action,
20STCV36549 Luis Angel Valdez v. Good Brother’s LLC, et al. (the
“Underlying Action”) against Greenify, Good Brother’s, the Estate of Everhart,
and Amazon Logistics. (UF 49-52.)
 
Greenify’s attorney tendered the Underlying Action to
Plaintiff on March 8, 2021. (UF 54.) Plaintiff issued reservation of rights
letters dated May 25, 2021 to Greenify and June 15, 2021 to Amazon Logistics,
in each of which Plaintiff asserted that there was no coverage for the
underlying action. (UF 55.)
 
Plaintiff filed this action on July 21, 2021. The operative
complaint is now the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), which raises claims for
(1) declaratory relief that Plaintiff has no duty to defend or indemnify
Greenify, Amazon Logistics, Good Brother’s, and Everhart in the Underlying
Action, and (2) indemnity for any sums expended for defense and indemnity on
behalf of Greenify and Amazon Logistics related to the Underlying Action.
 
The Court takes judicial notice that the Underlying Action
was dismissed on October 24, 2023 pursuant to Valdez’s request.
 
Plaintiff moved for summary judgment on January 9, 2024.
Greenify filed an opposition.
 
Legal Standard
 
The purpose of a motion for
summary judgment or summary adjudication “is to provide courts with a mechanism
to cut through the parties’ pleadings in order to determine whether, despite
their allegations, trial is in fact necessary to resolve their dispute.” (Aguilar
v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 843.) “Code of
Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (c), requires the trial judge to
grant summary judgment if all the evidence submitted, and ‘all inferences
reasonably deducible from the evidence’ and uncontradicted by other inferences
or evidence, show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and
that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (Adler v.
Manor Healthcare Corp. (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1110, 1119.) 
 
“In ruling on the motion,
the court must consider all of the evidence and all of the inferences
reasonably drawn therefrom [citation] and must view such evidence [citations]
and such inferences [citations] in the light most favorable to the opposing
party.” (Aguilar, supra, at pp. 844-845 [quotation marks
omitted].) 
 
“On a motion for summary
judgment, the initial burden is always on the moving party to make a prima
facie
showing that there are no triable issues of material fact.” (Scalf v. D. B.
Log Homes, Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1510, 1519.) 
 
“A plaintiff or
cross-complainant has met his or her burden of showing that there is no defense
to a cause of action if that party has proved each element of the cause of
action entitling the party to judgment on the cause of action. Once the
plaintiff or cross-complainant has met that burden, the burden shifts to the
defendant or cross-defendant to show that a triable issue of one or more
material facts exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto. The
defendant or cross-defendant shall not rely upon the allegations or denials of
its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but,
instead, shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of
material fact exists as to the cause of action or a defense thereto.” (Code
Civ. Proc. § 437c, subd. (p)(1).)
 
 To establish a triable issue of material fact,
the party opposing the motion must produce substantial responsive evidence. (Sangster
v. Paetkau (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 151,
166.) “If the plaintiff cannot do
so, summary judgment should be granted.” (Avivi v. Centro Medico Urgente
Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 467.)
 
Discussion
 
Indemnity – Second Claim
 
“An indemnitee seeking to recover on an agreement for
indemnification must allege the parties’ contractual relationship, the
indemnitee’s performance of that portion of the contract which gives rise to
the indemnification claim, the facts showing a loss within the meaning of the
parties’ indemnification agreement, and the amount of damages sustained.” (Four Star Electric, Inc. v. F & H
Construction (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1375, 1380.)
 
Plaintiff’s separate statement does not reflect facts
showing that Plaintiff expended any costs in defense of the Underlying Action.
 
The Court therefore denies summary adjudication on this
claim.
 
Declaratory Relief – First Claim
 
“To qualify for declaratory
relief, a party would have to demonstrate its action presented two essential
elements: (1) a proper subject of declaratory relief, and (2) an actual
controversy involving justiciable questions relating to the party’s rights or
obligations.” (Jolley v. Chase Home
Finance, LLC (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 872, 909, quotation marks and brackets
omitted.)
 
Further, “there is no basis for
declaratory relief where only past wrongs are involved.” (Osseous Technologies of America, Inc. v. DiscoveryOrtho Partners LLC
(2010) 191 Cal.App.4th 357, 366, quotation marks omitted.)
 
Here, the Underlying Action has been dismissed. Plaintiff’s
claim is therefore moot because there is no current controversy over
Plaintiff’s coverage obligations that is eligible for declaratory relief. 
 
The Court therefore denies summary adjudication on this
claim.
 
The Court denies the motion for summary judgment.
