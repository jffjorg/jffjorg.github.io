Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the motion to quash the notice of lien filed by plaintiff Daniel Tepper. The plaintiff argues that the attorneys of Wilshire Law Firm, including Ariella E. Perry, engaged in misconduct and possible malpractice while representing him, and therefore the notice of lien should be quashed. However, the court finds that it lacks jurisdiction to determine the existence or validity of an attorney's lien on the judgment, and that the trial court acts in excess of its jurisdiction when it purports to determine whether the attorney is entitled to foreclose a lien on the judgment. The court therefore denies the motion to quash the notice of lien.
