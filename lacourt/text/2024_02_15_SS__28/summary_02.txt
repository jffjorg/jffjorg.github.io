And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling denying without prejudice the petition to approve the compromise of Plaintiff Daniel Fernandez's claims against Defendant Leonel Anthony Lopez. The petition was filed by Petitioner Carolina Monterrey on January 22, 2024. The Judge's decision is based on the information presented, which shows that the petition does not fully disclose all information related to the reasonableness of the compromise or the covenant. Specifically, the petition does not account for all medical expenses that have not been reduced or waived, and there are unclear reductions to medical expenses. The Judge orders Petitioner to revise the petition or explain why further revisions are not needed.
