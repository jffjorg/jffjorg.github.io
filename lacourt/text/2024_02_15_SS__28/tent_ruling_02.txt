 Case Number:  21STCV35638    Hearing Date:   February 15, 2024    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
September 28, 2021, Plaintiff Daniel Fernandez ("Plaintiff"), by and through his guardian ad
litem Carolina Monterrey, filed this action against Defendants
Leonel Anthony Lopez (“Lopez”), County of Los Angeles, and Does 1-50 for motor
vehicle tort and premises liability. 
On
March 1, 2022, Lopez filed an answer. 
On
June 22, 2022, Plaintiff amended the complaint to include Defendant Francisco
Rodriguez aka Frank Rodriguez dba FR Electric (“Rodriguez”) as Doe 1. 
On
August 25, 2022, the clerk entered Rodriguez’s default. 
On
March 1, 2023, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement. 
On January
22, 2024, Petitioner Carolina Monterrey (“Petitioner”) filed a petition to
approve the compromise of Plaintiff Daniel Fernandez’s claims against Defendant
Leonel Anthony Lopez to be heard on February 15, 2024. 
No
trial date is currently scheduled. 
PETITIONER’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
asks the Court to approve the compromise of Plaintiff Daniel Fernandez’s claims
against Defendant Leonel Anthony Lopez. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
The
parties to a lawsuit may settle the claim of a person who
lacks the capacity to make decisions only with court approval.  (Prob. Code., §§ 2504, 3500, 3600 et seq.;
Code Civ. Proc., § 372; see Pearson v. Superior Court (2012) 202
Cal.App.4th 1333, 1337.) 
A
petition for court approval of a compromise or covenant not to sue under Code
of Civil Procedure section 372 must comply with California Rules of Court,
rules 7.950, 7.951 and 7.952. The petition must be verified by the petitioner
and contain a full disclosure of all information that has “any bearing upon the
reasonableness” of the compromise or the covenant. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule
7.950.) 
The
person compromising the claim on behalf of the person who lacks
capacity, and the represented person, must attend the hearing on compromise of
the claim unless the court for good cause dispenses with their personal
appearance. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.952.) 
DISCUSSION 
Section
12a(1) of the petition states that Plaintiff’s total medical expenses were $1,775,556.00.  Section 12a(3) states that this amount was reduced by $1,006,610.00 as the
result of negotiated, statutory, or contractual reductions. This leaves $768,946.00
in medical expenses (the difference between the total medical expenses and the
reductions) which have not been reduced or waived. The Court cannot approve a
compromise unless all medical expenses which have not been reduced or waived
will be reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.  Here, however, the petition
states that only $31,551.00 in medical expenses will be reimbursed from the
settlement proceeds (Section 12a(4)), leaving $737,395.00 in medical expenses
unaccounted for. 
Section
12b(5)(b) states that Kaiser Health Foundation Health Plan c/o Rawlings Company
charged (or was charged) $1,613,163.00. 
Of this amount, $917,650.00 was paid, $902,650.000 was reduced, and
$15,000.00 is to be paid from the settlement proceeds.  But it is unclear if the reduction figure of $902,650.00 includes what appears to be an initial reduction from $1,613,163.00 to
$917,650.00 ($695,513.00). 
If an initial reduction from $1,613,163.00 was made before Kaiser made
its payment of $917,650.00, and this reduction is not reflected in the reduction
amount currently listed in Section 12a(3) ($1,006,610.00), then the Section
12a(3) amount would need to be revised. 
Similarly,
it is unclear if Section 12a(3) of the petition currently reflects reductions
from the total amount charged by or to MediCal ($152,111.00) to the amount it
paid ($113,582.89 or $113,583.00 – the petition contains both figures).  And it is unclear if Section 12a(2) of the
petition currently reflects reductions from the total amount charged by or to Medicare/CMS
($4,192.00) to the amount it paid ($838.00).           Petitioner should make appropriate revisions to the
petition or explain why further revisions are not needed despite the issues
raised above. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES without prejudice the petition to approve the compromise of Plaintiff
Daniel Fernandez’s claims filed by Petitioner Carolina Monterrey on January 22,
2024. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
