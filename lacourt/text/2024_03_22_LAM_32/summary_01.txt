And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's motion to seal documents and requests for sanctions and disqualification. The plaintiff claims that defense counsel has not fully redacted all documents and may be inserting the plaintiff's name in various filings, violating the protective order. However, the plaintiff has not provided sufficient information to support these claims, and the judge cannot seal information on unspecified "other people." The judge also rejects the plaintiff's request to seal all filings in the case, as this is not supported by any reason or authority. The judge concludes that the plaintiff's motion to seal is denied, and sanctions are denied as the plaintiff has not demonstrated any sanctionable conduct by the defendant or his counsel.
