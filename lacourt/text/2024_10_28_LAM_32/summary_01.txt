Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Defendant Kiewit Infrastructure West Co.'s motions to compel Plaintiff Aerrianna McClellan to provide further responses to requests for production and interrogatories. The Plaintiff has not filed an opposition to the motions. The judge found that Defendant Kiewit satisfied the meet and confer requirement and established good cause for the requested documents. The Plaintiff's objections to the requests for production and interrogatories were found to be unjustified, and therefore, further responses are warranted. The judge ordered the Plaintiff to provide further responses to the discovery requests at issue within 20 days of the order.
