And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication on its first, second, third, and fourth causes of action. The plaintiff, Stearns Bank National Association, sued the defendants, B. Grigorovich D.D.S., Inc. and Boris Grigorovich, for breach of contract and breach of guaranty. The parties entered into two equipment finance agreements and security agreements, under which the plaintiff loaned the defendants money to purchase medical equipment. The defendants failed to make the required loan payments, and the plaintiff repossessed and resold the equipment. The plaintiff now seeks a judgment against the defendants for the loan balances remaining after application of the equipment sale proceeds.

The court found that the plaintiff has met its burden of proof, providing evidence of the existence of the contract, its performance, and the defendants' breach. The defendants did not file an opposition and did not provide evidence of a disputed material issue of fact. Therefore, the court granted summary adjudication as to the plaintiff's first, second, third, and fourth causes of action.
