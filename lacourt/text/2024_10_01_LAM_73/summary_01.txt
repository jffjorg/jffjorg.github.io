Here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motions to be relieved as counsel for Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant Fortress SF1, LLC and Cross-Defendant Jason Warner. The motions were filed by counsel, who explained that grounds for withdrawal exist under the provisions of Rule 1.16 of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The court finds that all requirements for relief have been completed, including serving the notice and declaration on all parties. The judge notes that the party has a reasonable amount of time to obtain new counsel, and therefore should not be prejudiced by the withdrawal.
