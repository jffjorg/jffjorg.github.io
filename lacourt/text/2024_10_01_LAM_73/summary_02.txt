And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted Petitioner Thomas Wesley Pentz's motion for an order allowing alternative service of the Application and Order for Appearance and Examination, and the Civil Subpoena (Duces Tecum) to Respondent Marchel Gabrielle Auguste. The motion was filed on May 24, 2024, and no opposition was filed. The court has determined that alternative service is warranted because Auguste has agreed to accept electronic service on all matters, and electronic service is deemed complete at the time of transmission or notification. The court has also found that Auguste has not withdrawn consent to receive electronic service. The judge has ordered that Pentz's request to electronically serve Auguste via email be granted.
