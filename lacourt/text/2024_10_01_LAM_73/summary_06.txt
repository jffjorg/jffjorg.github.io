And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by defendants Ultimate Host LLC, Nightfall Realty Inc., Mokhtar Jabli, Sagar Paresh Parikh, and Daniel Dangoor. The defendants had argued that the plaintiff, Afterparty Holdings, Inc., had failed to plead sufficient facts to state a cause of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation. The judge agreed, sustaining the demurrer to the fifth and sixth causes of action.

The judge also granted the defendants' motion to strike punitive damages against Nightfall Realty Inc., Parikh, and Dangoor, as the plaintiff had failed to plead facts sufficient to state a cause of action for fraud against these defendants.

The judge denied the defendants' motion to strike the seventh cause of action, which alleges negligent misrepresentation against some of the defendants.

The defendants had also argued that the plaintiff had improperly added the fifth and seventh causes of action after the court sustained the demurrer, but the judge disagreed, finding that the plaintiff's amended complaint was permissible.

The judge ordered that the defendants' demurrer be sustained with 20 days' leave to amend, and that the defendants' motion to strike punitive damages be granted with 20 days' leave to amend.
