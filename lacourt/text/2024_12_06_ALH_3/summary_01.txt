And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has set a tentative hearing for December 6, 2024, to consider the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment or adjudication. However, the hearing is continued because the plaintiff's entry of default against the defendant may be invalid due to insufficient proof of service. The judge notes that there is no record of service of a statement of damages on the defendant, which is required for actions involving personal injury. The judge also notes that the plaintiff failed to appear at a previous hearing and that the entry of default may constitute an admission of all material allegations of the complaint. Therefore, the judge sets an OSC (Order to Show Cause) to determine why the default should not be vacated. The judge also orders the plaintiff to ensure that his correct address is on file with the court.
