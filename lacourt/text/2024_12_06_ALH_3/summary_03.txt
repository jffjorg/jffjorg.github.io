And here is a summary of the Judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has issued a tentative ruling on the demurrer filed by Ganahl Lumber Company (Defendant) to dismiss the complaint filed by Rami Der-Artinian (Plaintiff). The Plaintiff alleged that he tripped and fell on a public sidewalk in front of the Defendant's store and that the Defendant was negligent in its maintenance of the sidewalk. The Defendant argued that since the sidewalk was public, it had no duty to maintain it and therefore was not liable for the Plaintiff's injuries.

The court has sustained the demurrer, meaning that the complaint will be dismissed unless the Plaintiff amends it to state facts that show that the Defendant owed a duty to the Plaintiff. The court has given the Plaintiff 20 days to amend the complaint. The court found that the Plaintiff did not plead sufficient facts to show that the Defendant owed a duty to the Plaintiff and that the Defendant did not create the uneven pavement that caused the Plaintiff's fall.
