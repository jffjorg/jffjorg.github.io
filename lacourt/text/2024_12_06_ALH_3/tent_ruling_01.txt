  ORDER RE: PLAINTIFF’S
   MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT/ADJUDICATION 
 
Dept.

On October 2, 2023,
plaintiff Peter S. Deng (“Plaintiff”) filed this complaint against defendant Rui
Shan (“Defendant”) for libel and slander per se. Plaintiff alleges that he has
practiced as an attorney from July 2021, and that Defendant published multiple false
statements about him in Chinese on www.CCYP.com, the website for Chinese
Consumer Yellow Pages (“CCYP”), on May 17, May 20, and May 24, 2023. (Compl.,
¶¶ 2, 11-13, 16-20.) 
Default was entered against
Defendant on January 31, 2024. On February 27, 2024, the Court scheduled a
default prove-up hearing for July 8, 2024. Plaintiff then failed to appear at
the prove-up hearing. Therefore, the hearing was continued to October 7, 2025. 
On October 4, 2024,
Plaintiff filed this motion for summary judgment or in the alternative, for
summary adjudication of each of the two causes of action alleged in his
Complaint. 
The Court sets an OSC re: Why Default
Should Not Be Vacated for ___________ at 8:30 a.m. in Department 3 because
there is no proof of service on record showing that Defendant was served with a
statement of damages as required for actions involving personal injury, nor is
there any specific amount of damages alleged in the Complaint. (See Van
Sickle v. Gilbert (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 1495, 1528-1529; Julius
Schifaugh IV Consulting Services, Inc. v. Avaris Capital, Inc. (2008) 164
Cal.App.4th 1393.) 
The hearing on this summary judgment
motion is CONTINUED to _____ because if Plaintiff’s entry of default is
determined to be correct, the motion for summary judgment/adjudication would be
improper and of no value because: (1) the Court would lack jurisdiction to do
anything other than rule on a motion for relief from default or enter default
judgment and (2) the entry of default constitutes an admission of all material
allegations of the Complaint, therefore no triable issues of material fact
would exist. (See W.A. Rose Co. v. Municipal Court of Oakland-Piedmont
Judicial District, County of Alameda (1959) 176 Cal.App.2d 67, 72; Vasey
v. California Dance Co., Inc. (1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 742, 749.) 
The Court additionally orders Plaintiff
to ensure that his correct address is on file with the Court because there have
been multiple instances of returned mail. The Court notes that the current mailing
address on file with the Court is 248 Saint Francis St., San Gabriel, CA 91776,
while the address on the caption page of Plaintiff’s moving papers is 123 E.
Valley Blvd., Suite 107, San Gabriel, CA 91776.
