And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has issued a tentative ruling in the case of Henry Huang and Powastar, Inc. v. Xiaoyan Chen, et al. The defendant had served special interrogatories on Powastar, but no responses were received. The defendant then filed a motion to compel responses, which Powastar opposed. The court has denied the motion to compel as moot, as Powastar has since served verified responses to the special interrogatories.

However, the court has imposed sanctions on Powastar and its counsel, Peter S. Deng, in the amount of $3,061.65. This is because Powastar failed to serve timely responses to the defendant's discovery requests, forcing the defendant to incur costs in drafting the motion and responding to Powastar's opposition brief. Furthermore, the court has criticized Powastar's counsel for using artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT to draft the opposition brief, which contained false legal references that were not independently verified. The court has also noted that this is the third discovery motion filed by the defendant against the plaintiffs, and that the plaintiffs' counsel has not provided a valid reason for the failure to serve timely responses.
