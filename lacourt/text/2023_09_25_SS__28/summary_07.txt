And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling:

The court has considered the moving papers and rules as follows. The plaintiff, Darren Dixon, filed a complaint against multiple defendants, including The Medici Apartments, GHP Management, Scorpion Securities, and others. The defendants filed answers and a cross-complaint. The plaintiff amended the complaint to include additional defendants.

GHP Management filed a motion to continue the trial, which is currently scheduled for January 23, 2024. The court granted in part the ex parte application of Scorpion and Sims to continue the trial and related dates, but denied the request to continue or reopen discovery without prejudice.

GHP's request to continue the trial and final status conference is moot, as the court has already continued the trial to January 23, 2024, and the final status conference to January 9, 2024. However, GHP also asked the court to continue all pre-trial related deadlines. The court denied GHP's request to continue or reopen discovery because the motion did not comply with the requirement of Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050, which requires a meet and confer declaration under Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040.

The court concludes that GHP's motion is denied, and the moving party is ordered to give notice of this ruling and to file the proof of service of this ruling with the court within five days.

## English Summary of the Judge's Tentative Ruling:

This case involves a lawsuit filed by Darren Dixon against several defendants, including GHP Management, for premises liability, negligence, assault, battery, and conversion.  

GHP Management has requested to continue the trial date and all pre-trial deadlines. However, the court finds GHP's request moot as the trial has already been continued to January 23, 2024.  

GHP also asked to reopen discovery, but the court denied this request because  GHP failed to properly comply with the procedural requirements for requesting such an extension. Specifically, GHP did not submit a "meet and confer" declaration demonstrating that they attempted to resolve the issue with all parties involved before filing the motion. 


Therefore, the court denies GHP's motion to continue the trial and its request to continue or reopen discovery.
