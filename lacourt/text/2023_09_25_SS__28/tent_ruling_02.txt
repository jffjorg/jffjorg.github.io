PARTIES’ REQUESTS 
Moving
Defendants request that the Court compel Plaintiff to appear for a deposition
and impose sanctions. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450 provides in part: 
“(a) If, after service of a deposition notice, a party
to the action . . . , without having served a valid objection under Section
2025.410, fails to appear for examination, or to proceed with it, or to produce
for inspection any document, electronically stored information, or tangible
thing described in the deposition notice, the party giving the notice may move
for an order compelling the deponent’s attendance and testimony, and the
production for inspection of any document, electronically stored information,
or tangible thing described in the deposition notice. 
“(b) A motion under subdivision (a) shall comply with
both of the following: 
“(1) The motion shall set forth specific facts showing
good cause justifying the production for inspection of any document,
electronically stored information, or tangible thing described in the
deposition notice. 
“(2) The motion shall be accompanied by a meet and
confer declaration under Section 2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to
attend the deposition and produce the documents, electronically stored
information, or things described in the deposition notice, by a declaration
stating that the petitioner has contacted the deponent to inquire about the
nonappearance. . . ." 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subds. (a), (b).) 
DISCUSSION 
On
March 14, 2023, Moving Defendants noticed Plaintiff’s deposition for March 30,
2023. Plaintiff did not object to the deposition notice.  (Sewell Dec. ¶¶ 5-6.) 
On
March 30, 2023, Plaintiff did not appear for the deposition. (Sewell Dec. ¶ 7.) 
Moving Defendants took a certificate of non-appearance. (Sewell Dec. ¶ 8.) 
 Moving Defendants’ counsel has not had any
contact with Plaintiff since March 30, 2023. 
Moving Defendants have not received any proposed dates for Plaintiff’s
deposition. (Sewell Dec. ¶ 9.) 
The
Court denies the motion.  Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450, subdivision (b),
requires that a motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450,
subdivision (a) “be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration under Section
2016.040, or, when the deponent fails to attend the deposition and produce the
documents, electronically stored information, or things described in the
deposition notice, by a declaration stating that the petitioner has contacted
the deponent to inquire about the nonappearance.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 2025.450, subd. (b).)  Moving Defendants have not provided a meet
and confer declaration or a declaration stating that they contacted Plaintiff
to inquire about her nonappearance at the deposition. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES the motion of Defendants Charter Communications, Inc., Gerald Rivera and
Jason Lizarraga to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Gladis Anabella Garcia. 
Moving
parties are ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
parties are ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
