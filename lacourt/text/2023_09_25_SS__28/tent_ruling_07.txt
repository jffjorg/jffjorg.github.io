On

conference, and all pre-trial related deadlines, to be heard on September 25,
2023.  No opposition has been filed. 
Trial
is currently scheduled for January 23, 2024. 
On September
13, 2023, Plaintiff amended the complaint to include Defendants Bria Beardsley as
Doe 2, Freddie Brown as Doe 3, Seth Burgess as Doe 4, Kevin Cater as Doe 5, James
Cuoco as Doe 6, Dan Castanada as Doe 7, Robert Castalan as Doe 8, Jorge
Calvillo as Doe 9, James Colbert as Doe 10, Karla Farias1 [sic] as Doe 11,
John Gaudino as Doe 12, Enrique Guerrero as Doe 13, and Evan Luster as Doe 14. 
Also
on September 13, 2023, the Court granted in part the ex parte application of
Scorpion and Sims to continue the trial and related dates.  The Court continued the trial to January 23, 2024,
and continued the final status conference to January 9, 2024.  The Court denied the request to continue or
reopen discovery without prejudice. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
GHP
requests that the Court continue the trial to a date on or after January 16,
2024, and continue the final status conference and all pre-trial related deadlines
to correspond to the new trial date. 
LEGAL STANDARD 
          Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 provides: 
“(a) On motion of any party, the court may grant leave
to complete discovery proceedings, or to have a motion concerning discovery
heard, closer to the initial trial date, or to reopen discovery after a new
trial date has been set. This motion shall be accompanied by a meet and confer
declaration under Section 2016.040. 
“(b) In exercising its discretion to grant or deny
this motion, the court shall take into consideration any matter relevant to the
leave requested, including, but not limited to, the following: 
“(1) The necessity and the reasons for the discovery. 
“(2) The diligence or lack of diligence of the party
seeking the discovery or the hearing of a discovery motion, and the reasons
that the discovery was not completed or that the discovery motion was not heard
earlier. 
“(3) Any likelihood that permitting the discovery or
hearing the discovery motion will prevent the case from going to trial on the
date set, or otherwise interfere with the trial calendar, or result in
prejudice to any other party. 
“(4) The length of time that has elapsed between any
date previously set, and the date presently set, for the trial of the action. 
“(c) The court shall impose a monetary sanction under
Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 2023.010) against any party, person, or
attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to extend or to reopen
discovery, unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted with
substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of
the sanction unjust.” 
(Code
Civ. Proc., § 2024.050.) 
DISCUSSION 
On
September 13, 2023, the Court continued the trial to January 23, 2024, and
continued the final status conference to January 9, 2024.  Therefore, GHP's request to continue the
trial and final status conference is moot. 
GHP also
asks the Court to continue all pre-trial related deadlines.  Although GHP’s motion does not cite Code of
Civil Procedure section 2024.050, the statute governs the Court’s consideration
of requests to continue or reopen discovery. 
(See Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.020, subd. (b) [“Except as provided in
Section 2024.050, a continuance or postponement of the trial date does not
operate to reopen discovery proceedings”].) 
A motion
to reopen discovery under Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050 must be “accompanied
by a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2024.050, subd. (a).)  “A meet and confer declaration in support of a
motion shall state facts showing a reasonable and good faith attempt at an
informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2016.040.) 
In
support of GHP’s motion, GHP submitted a declaration from its counsel stating in
part: “Prior to proceeding with this Motion, my office discussed the requested
trial continuance with counsels for Plaintiff and Scorpion. Scorpion does not
oppose a trial continuance while Plaintiff’s counsel has indicated he will not
stipulate to a continuance at this time.”  (Frankenberger
Dec. ¶ 13.)  The declaration addresses
only the issue of a trial continuance and shows that GHP discussed a trial continuance
with counsel for two of the other parties. 
The declaration does not show that GHP, Plaintiff, and Scorpion
attempted to resolve the issue of continuing or reopening discovery or that GHP
attempted to address this issue with the other parties that had appeared before
GHP filed its motion. 
Because
GHP’s motion does not comply with the requirement of Code of Civil Procedure
section 2024.050, subdivision (a), to provide a meet and confer declaration
under Code of Civil Procedure section 2016.040, the Court denies the request to
continue or reopen discovery. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES as moot Defendant GHP Management’s motion to continue the trial. 
The
Court DENIES Defendant GHP Management’s request to continue or reopen
discovery. 
Moving
party is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Moving
party is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court
within five days.
