**Case Number:** 23STCV07240
**Hearing Date:** September 25, 2023
**Dept:** 28

**Summary:**

The Court has considered the moving, opposing, and reply papers and rules as follows.

**Background:**

**Parties' Requests:**

Amtrak requests that the Court compel arbitration and grant a stay. Plaintiff requests that the Court deny the motion.

**Discussion:**

Amtrak's moving papers show that Plaintiff purchased a ticket from Amtrak's online website and affirmatively agreed to the Terms and Conditions, including the binding Arbitration Agreement. The Arbitration Agreement requires that any claims or disputes between Plaintiff and Amtrak be resolved through arbitration and not by way of court or jury trial.

**Plaintiff's Opposition:**

Plaintiff argues that the arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable because it requires submission to arbitration as a condition of purchasing a ticket from Amtrak. However, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to prove substantive unconscionability.

**Conclusion:**

The Court GRANTS Defendant National Railroad Passenger Corporation, service mark Amtrak's motion to compel arbitration and for a stay. Plaintiff is ordered to arbitrate his claims against Amtrak. The Court stays the action pending the outcome of arbitration.

**Case Number:** 23STCV07240

**Hearing Date:** September 25, 2023

**Plaintiff:** Zheng Jiang Xiao

**Defendant:** National Railroad Passenger Corporation d/b/a Amtrak

**Background:**

* On April 3, 2023, Plaintiff filed a lawsuit against Amtrak for negligence and negligent hiring, supervision, and retention.
* On June 7, 2023, Amtrak filed a motion to compel arbitration and for a stay.
* Plaintiff purchased a ticket from Amtrak's online website on April 3, 2021, and accepted Amtrak's Terms and Conditions, including an arbitration agreement.

**Dispute:**

* Amtrak argues that the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable.
* Plaintiff argues that the arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable and that passengers must submit to arbitration in order to purchase a ticket, which is procedurally unconscionable.

**Court's Ruling:**

* The Court grants Amtrak's motion to compel arbitration and for a stay.
* Plaintiff is ordered to arbitrate his claims against Amtrak.
* The Court stays the action pending the outcome of arbitration.
* Plaintiff has failed to prove substantive unconscionability, even if procedural unconscionability is present.
* An arbitration provision that applies equally to both parties is not "so harsh or oppressive that it should not be enforced."

**Significant Statements:**

* "Arbitration is a favored procedure. An ‘arbitration should be upheld unless it can be said with assurance that an arbitration clause is not susceptible to an interpretation covering the asserted dispute.’"
* "Doubts about the applicability of the arbitration clause to the dispute should be resolved ‘in favor of sending the parties to arbitration.’"
* "Unconscionability has a procedural and a substantive element. The prevailing view is that [procedural and substantive unconscionability] must both be present in order for the court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the doctrine of unconscionability."
* "Substantive unconscionability addresses the fairness of the term in dispute. Substantive unconscionability ‘traditionally involves contract terms that are so one-sided as to ‘shock the conscience,’ or that impose harsh or oppressive terms.’"
* "Procedural unconscionability addresses the manner in which agreement to the disputed term was sought or obtained, such as unequal bargaining power between the parties and hidden terms included in contracts of adhesion."
