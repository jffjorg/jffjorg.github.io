And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the City of Glendale. The City demurred to the second cause of action for general negligence, arguing that as a public entity, it cannot be liable for a tort unless a statute imposes liability. The City also moved to strike the negligence and willful failure to warn counts in the premises liability claim and the negligence claim, arguing that these counts are improper because the City is a public entity.

The judge has overruled the demurrer, concluding that the complaint states a valid claim for a dangerous condition of public property under Government Code sections 830-835.4. The judge has granted the City's motion to strike the negligence and willful failure to warn counts in the premises liability claim and the negligence claim, concluding that these counts are improper because the City is a public entity. The judge has also struck the second cause of action for negligence. The judge has granted the plaintiff 30 days leave to amend the complaint.
