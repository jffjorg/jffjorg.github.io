The judge has ruled on the demurrer and motion to strike filed by the City of Glendale. The City demurred to the second cause of action for general negligence, arguing that as a public entity, it cannot be liable for a tort unless a statute imposes liability. The City also moved to strike the negligence and willful failure to warn counts in the premises liability claim and the negligence claim, arguing that these counts are improper because the City is a public entity.

The judge has overruled the demurrer, concluding that the complaint states a valid claim for a dangerous condition of public property under Government Code sections 830-835.4. The judge has granted the City's motion to strike the negligence and willful failure to warn counts in the premises liability claim and the negligence claim, concluding that these counts are improper because the City is a public entity. The judge has also struck the second cause of action for negligence. The judge has granted the plaintiff 30 days leave to amend the complaint.

## English Summary

The Judge has ruled on a demurrer and motion to strike filed by the City of Glendale in a negligence and premises liability lawsuit filed by Alen Vartanian.

The Judge overruled the demurrer, meaning the lawsuit can proceed. However, the Judge granted the City of Glendale's motion to strike certain portions of Vartanian's complaint. Specifically, the Judge struck:

* The "Negligence" count within the premises liability claim
* The "Willful Failure to Warn" count within the premises liability claim
* The entire negligence claim

The Judge found that Vartanian's claims were improperly pleaded against a public entity like the City of Glendale, and that they were more accurately claims for a dangerous condition of public property.

Vartanian has 30 days to amend his complaint to correct these issues.
