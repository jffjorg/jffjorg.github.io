  Case Number:  19STCV16153    Hearing Date:   September 25, 2023    Dept:  28 Having
considered the petitioning papers, the Court rules as follows. 
BACKGROUND 
On
May 9, 2019, Plaintiffs Estate of Daniel Hinojos, Delores Hinojos, and Melanie
Dianela Hinojos filed this action against Defendants Maria Susana Martinez and
Ernesto Martinez for wrongful death, motor vehicle and general negligence. 
On
October 20, 2020, Defendants filed an answer. 
On September
6, 2023, Petitioner Birginia Santiago (“Petitioner”) filed a petition for
approval of minor’s compromise to be heard on September 25, 2023. 
PARTY’S REQUEST 
Petitioner
Birginia Santiago asks the Court to approve the compromise of the pending
action of Plaintiff Melanie Dianela Hinojos. 
DISCUSSION 
Sections
15 and 16f of the petition state that the net settlement amount is $3,715.18.  However, Section 18a(3)(a) of the petition asks
for authority to deposit or transfer proceeds of “$3,715.00” to be deposited in
insured accounts in one or more financial institutions in this state. 
Assuming
$3,715.18 is the intended net settlement amount, it is inconsistent with the petition’s
figures for the gross settlement amount ($7,500), requested attorney’s fees ($3,750,
but more about this below), and expenses ($784.82).  Subtracting the requested attorney’s fees and
expense amounts from the gross settlement amount leaves $2,965.18 as the net
settlement amount, not $3,715.18. 
Petitioner
asks the Court to award 50% of the gross settlement amount as attorney’s fees.  California Rules of Court, rule 7.955, “requires
a trial court, in determining reasonable attorney fees, to balance an
attorney's interest in fair compensation with the protection of the interests
of a minor client. Thus, a trial court ‘must give consideration to the terms of
any representation agreement made between the attorney and the representative
of the minor or person with a disability and must evaluate the agreement based
on the facts and circumstances existing at the time the agreement was made.’ ”
(Schulz v. Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc. (2018) 27 Cal.App.5th 1167, 1176-1177
(Schultz), quoting Cal. Rules of Court, rule 7.955(a)(2).) 
The Court
has considered the factors listed in rule 7.955 and concludes that an attorney’s
fee award of 25 percent of the gross settlement amount is reasonable in this case.  (See Schultz, supra, 27
Cal.App.5th at p. 1175 [“Even if there is no benchmark starting point for
attorney fees in cases under California Rules of Court, rule 7.955, a court may
of course reasonably determine that 25 percent is an appropriate percentage in
a given case”].) 
For
the reasons stated above, the Court denies the petition without prejudice. 
CONCLUSION 
The
Court DENIES the petition to approve the compromise of the pending action of minor
Melanie Dianela Hinojos filed by Petitioner Birginia Santiago without prejudice. 
Petitioner
is ordered to give notice of this ruling. 
Petitioner
is ordered to file the proof of service of this ruling with the Court within
five days.
