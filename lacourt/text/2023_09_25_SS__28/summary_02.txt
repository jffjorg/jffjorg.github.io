And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies the motion of Defendants Charter Communications, Inc., Gerald Rivera, and Jason Lizarraga to compel the deposition of Plaintiff Gladis Anabella Garcia. The motion was filed on May 12, 2023, and Plaintiff did not file an opposition. The motion was based on Plaintiff's failure to appear for a deposition scheduled for March 30, 2023, and the Court is requiring a meet and confer declaration under Section 2016.040 before considering the motion. The Court finds that Moving Defendants have not provided the required declaration, and therefore denies the motion.
