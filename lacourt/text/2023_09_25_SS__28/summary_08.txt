Summary:

The Tentative Ruling grants Sunhae Ji's motion to quash service of summons and complaint. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs have not carried their burden of proving the facts requisite to an effective service of process. The private investigator's declaration does not explain why he concluded Sunhae Ji lived at the Windsor Circle address at the time of the attempted service, and the Court is not required to accept the investigator's "information and belief" assertion. The Court quashes service of the summons and complaint on Sunhae Ji.
