```

Summary:

The Tentative Ruling grants Sunhae Ji's motion to quash service of summons and complaint. The Court finds that the Plaintiffs have not carried their burden of proving the facts requisite to an effective service of process. The private investigator's declaration does not explain why he concluded Sunhae Ji lived at the Windsor Circle address at the time of the attempted service, and the Court is not required to accept the investigator's "information and belief" assertion. The Court quashes service of the summons and complaint on Sunhae Ji.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to quash service of summons and complaint filed by Defendant Sunhae Ji. The judge found that the plaintiffs failed to prove that they properly served Sunhae Ji with the summons and complaint. The service was attempted on January 21, 2023, at an address on Windsor Circle in Cypress, California, but the judge found that the plaintiffs did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that Sunhae Ji lived at that address at the time of the attempted service. The judge also found that the private investigator's declaration did not explain why he concluded that Sunhae Ji lived at the address, and that the plaintiffs did not provide any other evidence to support this fact. As a result, the judge granted the motion and quashed the service of summons and complaint on Sunhae Ji.
