Summary:

The Tentative Ruling grants Sunhae Ji's motion to quash service of summons and complaint.

The private investigator's declaration does not explain why he concluded Sunhae Ji lived at the Windsor Circle address at the time of the attempted service, and the Court is not required to accept the investigator's "information and belief" assertion. The Court quashes service of the summons and complaint on Sunhae Ji.

And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted the motion to quash service of summons and complaint filed by Defendant Sunhae Ji. The judge found that the plaintiffs failed to prove that they properly served Sunhae Ji with the summons and complaint. The service was attempted on January 21, 2023, at an address on Windsor Circle in Cypress, California, but the judge found that the plaintiffs did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that Sunhae Ji lived at that address at the time of the attempted service. The judge also found that the private investigator's declaration did not explain why he concluded that Sunhae Ji lived at the address, and that the plaintiffs did not provide any other evidence to support this fact. As a result, the judge granted the motion and quashed the service of summons and complaint on Sunhae Ji.

## Tentative Ruling Summary: 22STCV38872

**Case Number:** 22STCV38872
**Hearing Date:** September 25, 2023
**Dept:** 28

**Parties:**

* **Plaintiffs:** Erica Seldon ("Seldon") and Venessa Hunter Patri ("Patri")
* **Defendants:** Sunhae Ji ("Sunhae Ji"), Junghoon Ji ("Junghoon Ji"), and Ean Holdings LLC (originally Doe 1)

**Background:**

*  On December 14, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against Defendants for motor vehicle tort and general negligence.
*  On August 8, 2023, Plaintiffs amended the complaint to include Ean Holdings LLC as Doe 1.
*  On February 10, 2023, Plaintiffs attempted to serve Sunhae Ji and Junghoon Ji by substituted service on Jake Joon, a co-occupant at their residence on Windsor Circle in Cypress, California.
*  Junghoon Ji filed an answer on April 18, 2023. Plaintiffs granted Sunhae Ji an extension to file an answer.
*  On May 12, 2023, Sunhae Ji filed a motion to quash service of the summons and complaint. 
*  Trial is currently scheduled for June 12, 2024.

**Sunhae Ji's Argument:**

* Sunhae Ji claims she never lived at the Windsor Circle address and does not have any connection to it.
* She states that she moved to South Korea around September 2022.
* Therefore, she argues that Plaintiffs did not properly serve her at her "dwelling house, usual place of abode, usual place of business, or usual mailing address" as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 415.20, subdivision (b).

**Plaintiffs' Argument:**

* They challenge the credibility of Junghoon Ji's declaration, arguing it lacks personal knowledge.
* They rely on their attorney's declaration and the declaration of private investigator Steve Lowes who states he found Sunhae Ji's address through proprietary databases and believes she resided there at the time of service.

**Court's Decision:**

* The Court overrules Plaintiffs' objection to Junghoon Ji's declaration, finding him capable of providing personal knowledge about whether Sunhae Ji lived at the address.
* The Court finds that Plaintiffs have not met their burden of proving the facts necessary for effective service of process. 
* The Court accepts that Sunhae Ji did not reside at the Windsor Circle address at the time of service.
*  The Court GRANTS Sunhae Ji's motion to quash service of the summons and complaint.


**Significance:** 

The Court's ruling quashes the service of process on Sunhae Ji, meaning the lawsuit against her cannot proceed until Plaintiffs properly serve her. This decision highlights the importance of ensuring proper service of process in legal proceedings.
