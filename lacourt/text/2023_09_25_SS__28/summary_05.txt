And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the moving, opposing, and reply papers and rules as follows. Flexdrive, a defendant, has filed a motion for leave to file and serve a first amended answer. The amended answer includes two additional affirmative defenses: that Flexdrive is not liable under the Graves amendment and that Flexdrive has complied with its obligations under Vehicle Code sections 14608-14609.

The court grants the motion. Flexdrive is ordered to file and serve the first amended answer within 30 days of the hearing on the motion. The court finds that Plaintiff has not established prejudice and that the proposed affirmative defenses are not meritless. The court does not express an opinion on the application of these affirmative defenses.

The court's ruling is based on the legal standard that a court may, in furtherance of justice, allow a party to amend a pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect. The court also notes that it is a rare case in which a court will refuse a party leave to amend its pleadings so that it may properly present its case.
