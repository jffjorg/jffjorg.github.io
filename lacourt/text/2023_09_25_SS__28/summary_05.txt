And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The court has considered the moving, opposing, and reply papers and rules as follows. Flexdrive, a defendant, has filed a motion for leave to file and serve a first amended answer. The amended answer includes two additional affirmative defenses: that Flexdrive is not liable under the Graves amendment and that Flexdrive has complied with its obligations under Vehicle Code sections 14608-14609.

The court grants the motion. Flexdrive is ordered to file and serve the first amended answer within 30 days of the hearing on the motion. The court finds that Plaintiff has not established prejudice and that the proposed affirmative defenses are not meritless. The court does not express an opinion on the application of these affirmative defenses.

The court's ruling is based on the legal standard that a court may, in furtherance of justice, allow a party to amend a pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect. The court also notes that it is a rare case in which a court will refuse a party leave to amend its pleadings so that it may properly present its case.

## English Summary

The judge is considering a motion by Flexdrive, the company that rented a car to the driver involved in an accident, to amend its answer to the lawsuit.  

The Plaintiff, Alfonso Leon Baltazar, was injured in the accident and is suing Flexdrive, along with the driver, Lael Williams, and Lyft, the company for which Williams was driving. Flexdrive wants to add two new defenses to its answer based on the Graves Amendment and California Vehicle Code provisions. 

The Plaintiff argues that these amendments are unnecessary and would prejudice his case because he already took two depositions of Williams. However, the judge finds that the Plaintiff has not shown that he would be prejudiced by the amendments and that he has had sufficient opportunity to question Williams.

Therefore, the judge grants Flexdrive's motion to amend its answer. Flexdrive will have 30 days to file the amended answer.
