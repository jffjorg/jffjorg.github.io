And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has considered the petition for approval of the minor's compromise and has denied it without prejudice. The petition was filed by Birginia Santiago on behalf of Melanie Dianela Hinojos, a minor. The petition asks the Court to approve the compromise and to award attorney's fees. However, the Judge has found that the net settlement amount of $3,715.18 is inconsistent with the petition's figures for the gross settlement amount, attorney's fees, and expenses. The Judge has also considered the factors listed in California Rules of Court, rule 7.955, and has concluded that an attorney's fee award of 25 percent of the gross settlement amount is reasonable in this case.
