MOTIONS
 
            Plaintiff and Cross-Defendant
Prohealth Advanced Imaging Medical Group, Inc. (“Prohealth”) moves to compel
responses from Defendant and cross-complainant, Hess D. Panah Esq (“Panah”) to Form
Interrogatory Number 17 (Set Two) (“FROG-2”); Special Interrogatories (Set Two)
(“SROG-2”); and Requests for Admission (Set Two) (“RFA-2”).  Prohealth also seeks monetary sanctions in
connection with the motions.  Panah has
not filed oppositions to the motions.   
 
LEGAL
STANDARDS
 
1.      Interrogatories
 
Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.290, “[i]f a party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a
timely response . . . [t]he party to whom the interrogatories are directed
waives any right to exercise the option to produce writings under Section
2030.230, as well as any objection to the interrogatories, including one based
on privilege or the protection for work product under Chapter 4 (commencing
with Section 2018.010.  . . .   [and] The party propounding the
interrogatories may move for an order compelling response to the
interrogatories.”  (Code Civ. Proc., § 2030.290, subds. (a)-(b).) 
 
2.      Requests
for Admission
 
             Pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 2033.280, subdivision (a), “[i]f a party to whom requests
or admission are directed fails to serve a timely response . . .  [t]he party to whom the requests for
admission are directed waives any objection to the requests, including one
based on privilege or on the protection for work product[.]”  (Code Civ.
Proc., § 2033.280, subd. (a).)  Where a party fails to respond to
requests for admissions, the propounding party may move for an order that the
genuineness of any documents and the truth of any matters specified in the
requests be deemed admitted, as well as for a monetary sanction.¿ (Code Civ. Proc.,
§ 2033.280, subd. (b).)
 
ANALYSIS
 
1.     
Discovery Requests
 
Prohealth served Panah the FROG-2, SROG-2
and RFA-2 on May 24, 2023.  (See Talkov
Decl. ¶ 3 and Exs. 1-2 thereto.)  Panah
did not timely respond to the subject discovery requests.  On September 12, 2023, after the responses
were already overdue, Prohealth granted Panah an extension until September 18,
2023 to provide responses, without objections. 
(Talkov Decl. ¶ 5 & Ex. 2.) 
Panah has not responded. 
Accordingly, the Court finds that Panah has failed to timely serve
responses to the FROG-2, SROG-2 and RFA-2.
 
However, with respect to the RFA-2,
Prohealth has styled its motion as a “motion to compel” responses to the RFA-2,
and has relied upon the statutory provisions applying to interrogatories, as
opposed to requests for admission.  When
a litigant fails to timely respond to requests for admission, the proper remedy
is a motion to deem admitted.  (Code
Civ. Proc., § 2033.280.)  Similarly, Code of Civil Procedure section
2030.290 applies to interrogatories, not requests for admission.  Further, Prohealth failed to attach to its
moving papers a copy of the subject RFA-2. 
As such, the Court Prohealth’s “motion
to compel” RFA-2 is procedurally defective. 

 
2.     
Monetary Sanctions
Prohealth
requests monetary sanctions in connection with the motions.  The Court finds Panah’s failure to timely
respond to the FROG-2 and SROG-2 to be an abuse of the discovery process,
warranting monetary sanctions.  (See Code
Civ. Proc., §§ 2023.010, subd. (d), 2030.290, subd. (c).)  Accordingly, the Court will impose monetary
sanctions against Panah in the amount of $1590.00, which represents four hours
of attorney time to prepare the moving papers, and attend the hearing, at $350
per hour, plus the motion filing fees of $120 at $60 per motion.   
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
Therefore, the Court grants Plaintiff’s
motions to compel responses to the FROG-2 and SROG-2 per Code of Civil
Procedure sections 2030.290.  As such,
the Court orders Panah to serve verified responses to the FROG-2 and SROG-2,
without objections, within 20 days of this order.
 
The Court denies Plaintiff’s motion to compel responses to RFA-2
without prejudice under Code of Civil Procedure section 2033.280.
 
Finally,
the Court orders Panah to pay monetary sanctions in the amount $1590 to Prohealth,
by and through counsel for Prohealth, within 20 days of this order. 
 
Prohealth is ordered to
provide notice of the Court’s orders and file a proof of service of such.

MOTIONS
 
            This lawsuit arises out of a breach
of contract dispute concerning Defendant and Cross-Complainant Hess D. Panah
Esq.’s (“Panah” or “Defendant”) referral of various patients to Plaintiff and
Cross-Defendant Prohealth Advanced Imaging Medical Group, Inc. (“Prohealth” or
“Plaintiff”) for various medical services. 

 
            Prohealth moves for an order
compelling Panah to provide supplemental responses to the following discovery
requests:
 
1.     
Form Interrogatories (Set 1), Nos. 2 & 5 (FROG-1)
a.

            Panah opposes the motions and
Prohealth has replied.  
 
PROCEDURAL
REQUIREMENTS
 
            Informal Discovery Conference
 
            Per the Courtroom Information for
Beverly Hills, Dept. 207, ¶ 12, if parties cannot agree on discovery issues,
“the parties are to schedule an Informal Discovery Conference” and following
the IDC, “the Court may or may not grant permission to the parties to file any
motions to compel discovery or compel further discovery responses.”
 
            Here, the parties complied by
scheduling and attending an Informa Discovery Conference on July 7 2023.
 
            Timeliness of Motion
 
            A notice of motion to compel further
responses must be given within 45 days of the service of the responses, or any
supplemental responses, or on or before any specific later date to which the
parties have agreed in writing. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 2030.300, subd. (c).)  Failure to file such a motion within this time
period constitutes a waiver of any right to compel further responses to
interrogatories.  (Ibid.; see also Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Superior Court (1983)
147 Cal.App.3d 681, 683 [“This statute is mandatory and the court may not
entertain a belated motion to compel”]; Sexton v. Superior Court (1997)
58 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1410 [the trial court is without authority to rule on
motions to compel further discovery responses that are untimely].)   
 
            Panah objects to the motions on the
basis that they are untimely.  The Court
agrees.
 
            Panah served verified responses to
FROG-1 and SROG-1 on June 21, 2023 by electronic transmission.  As such, under Code of Civil Procedure
section 2030.300, Prohealth’s motions to compel further responses to FROG-1 and
SROG-1 were due on or before August 9, 2023 (45 calendar days + 2 court days
for service).  Prohealth filed the
instant motions on September 19, 2023 – 41 days after the statutory deadline.  
 
            At the July 7, 2023 IDC, the Court
notes that Panah agreed to serve further responses to the subject discovery
requests by August 18, 2023.  (See July
7, 2023 Minute Order.)  The Court further
notes that the minute order of July 7 indicates:  “If Plaintiff does not receive the further
responses to the first set of requests and/or responses to the second set of
requests, Plaintiff may proceed with filing a motion to compel.)  (Ibid.)  What is unclear to the Court is whether the
parties agreed to extend the motion deadline in writing as
required under Section 2030.300, subdivision (c) or whether the parties agreed orally
during the July 7 IDC to extend Prohealth’s deadline to file motions to compel
further discovery responses.  The minute
order is silent as to any extension of the August 9 motion deadline.  
                        
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
 
            The Court is without jurisdiction to
hear the motions to compel supplemental responses.  Consequently, the Court denies Prohealth’s
motions to compel supplemental responses to FROG-1 and SROG-1.  
 
            Prohealth shall provide notice of
the Court’s ruling and file a proof of service regarding the same.
