[1] The declaration attached to the Motion is
unsigned.  However, Plaintiff attached a
signed version of the declaration to the Reply brief, which differed only in
that it added a paragraph to explain that an unsigned version was inadvertently
filed with the moving papers.  Because
Defendant did not raise the issue in the opposition, and because the signed
version was identical to the original version, except for the additional
paragraph explaining the mistake, the Court accepts and considers the signed
version of the declaration attached to the Reply.
