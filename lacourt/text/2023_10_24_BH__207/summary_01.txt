Here is a summary in English text:

The Judge, Michael E. Whitaker, has issued a tentative ruling in two motions regarding discovery requests. The first motion is a motion to compel responses to Form Interrogatory Number 17 (Set Two), Special Interrogatories (Set Two), and Requests for Admissions (Set Two) served on the defendant, Hess D. Panah Esq. The Court grants the motion and orders Panah to serve verified responses to the discovery requests without objections within 20 days. The Court also awards monetary sanctions in the amount of $1590.00 to Prohealth Advanced Imaging Medical Group, Inc.

The second motion is a motion to compel supplemental responses to Form Interrogatories (Set One) Nos. 2 and 5 and Special Interrogatories (Set One) Nos. 2 and 5 served on Panah. The Court denies the motion because it was filed late, as the parties failed to agree in writing to an extension of the motion deadline. The Court notes that the parties did agree to serve further responses to the discovery requests, but the minute order is silent as to any extension of the motion deadline.
