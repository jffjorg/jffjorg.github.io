Background
 
On November 1, 2023, Regency
Centers, LP (“Plaintiff”) filed a Complaint against Alankar Verma, Megna
Holdings, Inc., Mahmud Ulkarim, Monira Ulkarim, and Does 1 to 20. The Complaint
alleges two causes of action for breach of contract and breach of guaranty. 
 
On January 3, 2024, Defendant
Alankar Verma filed a motion to strike the Plaintiff’s Complaint.[1] On January 18, 2024, the
Plaintiff filed opposing papers. The matter is now before the court. 
 
 
 
motion to
strike[2]
I.         Legal Standard
Any party, within the time allowed to respond to a pleading
may serve and file a notice of motion to strike the whole or any part thereof.
(CCP § 435(b)(1); CRC, rule 3.1322(b).) The court may, upon a motion or at any
time in its discretion and upon terms it deems proper: (1) strike out any
irrelevant, false, or improper matter inserted in any pleading; or (2) strike
out all or any part of any pleading not drawn or filed in conformity with the
laws of California, a court rule, or an order of the court. (CCP § 436(a)-(b); Stafford
v. Shultz (1954) 42 Cal.2d 767, 782 [“Matter in a pleading which is not
essential to the claim is surplusage; probative facts are surplusage and may be
stricken out or disregarded”].)¿¿¿¿¿ 
¿ 
“Where the defect raised by a motion to strike or by demurrer
is reasonably capable of cure, leave to amend is routinely and liberally
granted to give the plaintiff a chance to cure the defect in question.” (CLD
Construction, Inc. v. City of San Ramon (2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 1141, 1146.)
The burden is on the complainant to show the Court that a pleading can be
amended successfully. (Goodman v. Kennedy (1976) 18 Cal.3d 335, 348.)¿¿¿
 
II.        Request for Judicial Notice
 
The court may take judicial notice of “official acts of the
legislative, executive, and judicial departments of the United States and of
any state of the United States,” “[r]ecords of (1) any court of this state or
(2) any court of record of the United States or of any state of the United
States,” and “[f]acts and propositions that are not reasonably subject to
dispute and are capable of immediate and accurate determination by resort to
sources of reasonably indisputable accuracy.” (Evid. Code § 452(c), (d), and
(h).) “Taking judicial notice of a document is not the same as
accepting the truth of its contents or accepting a particular interpretation of
its meaning.” (Joslin v. H.A.S. Ins. Brokerage (1986) 184
Cal.App.3d 369, 374.)
 
The Plaintiff requests judicial
notice of the following: 
 
1)    
Exhibit 1: A copy of Resolution No.
2020-049, a Resolution of the City of thousand Oaks rescinding and restating
certain emergency orders. Resolution 2020-049 continued a temporary moratorium
on interest relating to water and waste water utility bills, and business
licenses on page 5, articles 5(a) and (g) of the Resolution. 
 
The Plaintiff’s
request for judicial notice is granted. 
 
 
 
 
II.        Discussion 
 
Defendant Alankar
Verma (“Verma”) seeks to strike the reference to “interest” in the Complaint on
Page 6, Paragraph 2.  Defendant Verma
states that the City of Thousand Oaks, Resolution No. 2020-011, has a
moratorium that prohibits the collection of interest for commercial tenancies
for the portion of the tenancy at issue. Defendant Verma further asserts that
Resolution No. 2020-049 rescinded Resolution No. 2020-011 as of November 11,
2020. 
 
Plaintiff asserts
that it is entitled as a matter of law to recover pre-judgment interest. (Civ.
Code, §§ 3287, 3289, 3300, and 3302.) Moreover, Plaintiff asserts that the
Lease and guarantees at issue specifically allow interest to accrue on any
money not paid. (Compl. Ex. 1 §§ 1.1(l), 4.7, and 18.1(f).) Lastly, Plaintiff
asserts that Resolution No. 2020-011 did not prohibit Plaintiff from charging
or collecting interest on unpaid rent. Plaintiff argues that even if Resolution
2020-011 prohibited the charging of and collection of interest, it only applies
to a “portion of the period at issue” and does not bar interest in its
entirety. Thus, the factual question would be how much interest Plaintiff can
charge and not whether Plaintiff is entitled to interest. 
 
As neither party has
provided a copy of Resolution 2020-011, the court cannot determine if the
Plaintiff is prohibited from charging interest. Accordingly, Defendant Verma
has failed to meet his burden of showing that a defect exists on the face of
the Complaint. Moreover, Defendant Verma failed to submit a declaration showing
that he attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff’s counsel prior to filing
this demurrer. (CCP § 430.41.)
 
For the reasons set
forth above, Defendant Verma’s motion to strike is denied. 
 
Conclusion
 
Defendant Verma’s motion to strike is
denied. Plaintiff to give notice.
