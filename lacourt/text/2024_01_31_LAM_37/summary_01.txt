And here is the English-text summary:

The tentative ruling denies Defendant Alankar Verma's motion to strike the Plaintiff's Complaint. The motion sought to strike the reference to "interest" in the Complaint on Page 6, Paragraph 2. Defendant Verma argued that the City of Thousand Oaks' Resolution No. 2020-011, which had a moratorium on interest for commercial tenancies, prohibited the Plaintiff from charging or collecting interest. However, the Plaintiff argued that it is entitled to recover pre-judgment interest as a matter of law and that the Lease and guarantees at issue specifically allow interest to accrue on any money not paid. The court denied the motion to strike because neither party provided a copy of Resolution 2020-011, and the court cannot determine if the Plaintiff is prohibited from charging interest. The court also noted that Defendant Verma failed to submit a declaration showing that he attempted to meet and confer with Plaintiff's counsel prior to filing the demurrer.
