  Case Number:  24STCV09768    Hearing Date:   April 24, 2024    Dept:  39 Law Offices of
Phoenix Thottam v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, et al. 
Case Number 24STCV09768
Ex Parte
Application for Temporary Restraining Order 
and OSC re:
Preliminary Injunction
 
            The Court
issued the following order on April 23, 2024:
 
            The Law
Offices of Phoenix Thottam (“Plaintiff”) filed this action against JPMorgan
Chase Bank and Bank of America asserting a claim for Violation of Regulation E
of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (the “federal cause of action”), as well
as a series of common law claims. 
Plaintiff filed this action on April 17, 2024, and JPMorgan Chase Bank filed
a notice of removal on April 18, 2024, based upon the federal question.  The notice of removal “shall effect the
removal and the State court shall proceed no further unless and until the case
is remanded.”  (28 U.S.C. §
1446(d).)  
 
            Plaintiff
suggests that he intends to dismiss his federal cause of action.  (See Declaration of Phoenix Thottam, ¶¶
13-15.)  Plaintiff filed a request for
dismissal in state court.  (See Request
for Dismissal, dated April 22, 2024.)  This
has no effect because the case has been removed and is pending in federal
court.  Rather, Plaintiff must address
this issue with the federal court.  The
court reviewed the federal docket for Case Number 24-CV-03220-PA (JCx) and
understands that Plaintiff noticed a motion for remand for hearing on April 24,
2024.  
 
Plaintiff filed an ex parte
application for a temporary restraining order and an order to show cause why a
preliminary injunction should not issue. 
Plaintiff filed his ex parte application on April 19, 2024, but he
noticed the hearing in the wrong department, in violation of Local Rules 2.8
and 2.9.  Plaintiff re-noticed the
hearing in Department #82 for April 24, 2024, at 8:30 a.m.  Because the case has not been remanded, however,
this court has no jurisdiction at this stage. 

 
Based upon Plaintiff’s counsel’s
representation that he intends to dismiss the federal cause of action, the
court advances and continues the hearing on the ex parte application to Monday,
April 29, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.  This should
afford sufficient time for the case to be remanded, assuming Plaintiff
dismisses the federal cause of action, and for JPMorgan Chase to file an
opposition to the ex parte application.  
 
Plaintiff’s counsel shall provide
notice via email and shall file proof of service with the court.
