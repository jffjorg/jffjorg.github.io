 Case Number:  23STCV16061    Hearing Date:   February 28, 2024    Dept:  15 [TENTATIVE] ORDER RE MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER
RESPONSES AND DOCUMENTS
In the September 7, 2023
order on Defendants IMI Fabi’s, LLC, IMI Fabi (USA), Inc.’s, and IMI Fabi
(Diana), LLC’s motions to quash for lack of personal jurisdiction, the court
continued the hearing to allow jurisdictional discovery on “Defendants’
activities in and contacts with California and its sale of talc for those
particular products [referring to Mary Kay, Revlon, Max Factor, and Johnson
& Johnson products] during the time Plaintiff was using those products.”
On October 27, 2023,
Plaintiff filed a motion to compel further responses to requests for production
of documents from IMI Fabi, LLC.  In the
December 8, 2023 order on that motion, the court ruled:  “Plaintiff failed to file a separate
statement.  If Plaintiff fails in that
regard in the future, the court will deny the motion on that ground alone.  Also, because Plaintiff did not file a
separate statement and did not address each request separately in its motion,
the court cannot determine the relevance of many of the requests, as discussed
below.”  In other words, the court gave
Plaintiff one “freebie” for not complying with the California Rules of Court separate
statement requirement.
On January 31, 2024,
Plaintiff filed another motion to compel further responses to requests for production
of documents and deposition questions from Defendants IMI Fabi, LLC, IMI Fabi
(USA), Inc. and IMI Fabi (Diana), LLC.  Again,
Plaintiff did not file a separate statement as required by California Rule of
Court, rule 3.1345, subdivision (a).  In
the December 8, 2023 order, the court warned Plaintiff that a separate
statement is required and that the court would not consider a future motion to
compel further discovery responses without a separate statement.  (See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc.
v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 390, 409 n. 14
[“the court rule requiring a separate statement on a motion to compel further
responses . . . would permit the trial court to continue or deny a motion to
compel when no separate statement is provided”]; Mills v. U.S. Bank (2008)
166 Cal.App.4th 871, 893 [court “was well within its discretion to deny the
motion to compel discovery” where moving party failed to file proper separate
statement].)  
Because Plaintiff ignored
Rule 3.1345 a second time, despite the court’s December 8, 2024 warning, the
motion to compel further responses is DENIED.
The moving party is to
give notice.
