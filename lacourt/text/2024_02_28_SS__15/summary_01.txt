And here is a summary of the tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied Valley Brake Supply's motion for summary judgment, which sought to conclude that the company is not liable for asbestos exposure claims brought by Darren Hargrove and Kevin Hargrove. The plaintiffs' claims arise from the exposure of Patricia Bacer Wilson, the wife of one of the plaintiffs, to asbestos from Valley Brake Supply's products.

The judge ruled that there are disputed issues of material fact regarding Valley Brake Supply's liability for pre-1992 exposure, as the company's current owner may be liable as a successor to the prior owner's business. The judge noted that Valley Brake Supply's current owner, Frank Cho, purchased the company in October 1992, and that the company's sales documents show no agreement of assumption of the prior liabilities.

The judge also ruled that Valley Brake Supply's attempt to shift the burden to the plaintiffs failed, as the plaintiffs presented disputed facts showing that Patricia Bacer was exposed to asbestos from Valley Brake Supply's products. The judge noted that Bacer was present during automotive repair work, including work with brakes, and assisted her sons and husband with brake jobs.

The parties are ordered to meet and confer about how the issue of successor liability is to be resolved, and the moving party is to give notice.
