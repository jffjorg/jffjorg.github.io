to Compel Initial Discovery Responses

Legal
Standard
 
 If a
party to whom interrogatories are directed fails to serve a timely response,
the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a
monetary sanction. (CCP § 2030.290(b).) The statute contains no time limit for
a motion to compel where no responses have been served. All that need be shown
in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on
the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response
of any kind has been served. (Leach v. Superior Court (1980) 111 Cal.
App. 3d 902, 905-906.) 
 
ANALYSIS
Defendant Pauly Shore moves for an order compelling Plaintiff Sean
Kehoe to serve verified responses, without objection, to Defendant’s Form
Interrogatories (Set One). On September 23, 2024, Defendant propounded his
first set of discovery, including the subject Form Interrogatories on Plaintiff.
Plaintiff’s responses were due October 25, 2024. (Giennetto Decl. ¶ 4; Ex. A)
Defendant informally met and conferred prior to filing this motion did
not receive any responses to the subject discovery. (Giennetto Decl.,
¶¶ 5-6.)
In
opposition, Plaintiff explains that he served verified responses to the subject
discovery on December 23, 2024. (Brief Decl., ¶ 8; Ex. A.) Plaintiff has
provided substantially code compliant discovery responses. As such, the motion
is MOOT. 
The Court must
sanction any party that unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel a
further response, “unless it finds that the one subject to the sanction acted
with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition
of the sanction unjust.” (See, e.g., CCP, § 2030.290(c).)  Plaintiff notes that his failure to
respond was due to counsel’s failure to calendar the deadline properly. (Brief
Decl. ¶6.) Plaintiff does not provide substantial justification for his failure
to provide timely responses. Sanctions are imposed in the reasonable amount of
$1,110.00, inclusive of costs, against Plaintiff’s counsel of
record only.
