  Case Number:  22STCV07797    Hearing Date:   June 4, 2024    Dept:  78 Superior Court of California County of Los Angeles Department 78  SALLYANNE PAYTON,Plaintiff, vs. JOSEPH GRIFFITH, et al., Defendants.  Case No.:  22STCV07797 Hearing Date:  June 4, 2024  [TENTATIVE] RULING RE: MOTION FOR ATTORNEY’S FEES FILED BY PLAINTIFF SALLYANNE PAYTONThe motion for attorney’s fees and costs filed by Plaintiff Sallyanne Payton is DENIED.Moving party to give notice. FACTUAL BACKGROUNDThis is an action for fraud, financial elder abuse, quiet title, cancellation of deeds, and declaratory relief. Plaintiff Sallyanne Payton, as trustee of the Monteith Drive Trust, alleges that Defendant Joseph Griffith misrepresented the condition Plaintiff’s property, the value of the property, and that continuing to own the property would expose Plaintiff to liability. Griffith made these misrepresentations to induce Plaintiff to sign a grant deed transferring ownership of her property to Griffith.Griffith filed a Cross-Complaint against Payton and Tammy Williams for fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Griffith alleges that while he was working as a handyman on the property, he jokingly said he would be interested in making an offer on the property. Griffith recommended urgently needed repairs which Payton stated she had no money for. Payton stated the home was worth $200,000, that she needed money urgently, and would be willing to sign any papers to assist Griffith in obtaining a loan to purchase the property. Griffith alleges that Payton had no intention of selling the property and sold the property to him in a scam to obtain free repair and maintenance services and to obtain the sales proceeds through a quick escrow. PROCEDURAL HISTORY On March 3, 2022, Plaintiff filed her Complaint against Defendants Griffith and Jack Shut.On May 31, 2022, Plaintiff filed her First Amended Complaint.On October 31, 2022, Griffith filed a Cross-Complaint against Cross-Defendants Payton and Tammy Williams.On August 2, 2023, the Court sustained Payton’s first demurrer to the Cross-Complaint.On August 17, 2023, Griffith dismissed Tammy Williams and filed a First Amended Cross-Complaint (“FACC”).On January 29, 2024, the Court sustained Plaintiff’s demurrer to the FACC.On January 31, 2024, the Court entered judgment dismissing the FACC.On February 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed this motion for attorney’s fees.DISCUSSION Plaintiff seeks $16,440 in attorney’s fees on the grounds that the she is the prevailing party on the FACC and the fees are authorized under (1) Civ. Code, section 1717 and (2) Wel. and Inst. Code, section 1567.5. Legal Standard Unless a statute provides for them, (e.g., Code of Civil Procedure sections 1032, et seq.), the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties.¿(Code Civ. Proc., section 1021.)¿ The prevailing party on a contract, which specifically provides for attorney fees and costs incurred to enforce the agreement, is entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs.¿ (Civ. Code, section 1717, subd. (a); Code Civ. Proc., sections 1032; 1033.5, subd. (a)(10)(A).) The court, upon notice and motion by a party, shall determine the prevailing party and shall fix, as an element of the costs of suit, the reasonable attorney fees.¿ (Civ. Code, section 1717, subds. (a), (b).)¿ A party moving for attorneys’ fees as an element of costs shall serve and file the notice before or at the same time the party serves and files the memorandum of costs; if only attorney fees are claimed as costs, the party shall serve and file the notice within the time specified in the Rules of Court, Rule 3.1700 for filing a memorandum of costs.¿ (Cal. Rules Court. 3.1702; Gunlock Corp. v. Walk on Water, Inc. (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1303, fn. 1.)¿¿¿  ¿¿¿ “It is well established that the determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of the trial court, whose decision cannot be reversed in the absence of an abuse of discretion.”¿ (Melnyk v. Robledo (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 618, 623 624.) The fee setting inquiry in California ordinarily “begins with the ‘lodestar’ [method], i.e., the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate.”¿ (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales, Inc. (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 154.)¿ “[A] computation of time spent on a case and the reasonable value of that time is fundamental to a determination of an appropriate attorneys’ fee award.”¿ (Margolin v. Reg’l Planning Comm’n (1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 999, 1004.)¿ The court may then adjust the lodestar figure based on consideration of factors specific to the case, to fix the fee at the fair market value for the legal services provided.¿ (See Serrano v. Priest (1977) 20 Cal.3d 25, 49 [discussing factors relevant to proper attorneys’ fees award].)¿   In challenging attorney fees as excessive because the moving party claimed too many hours of work, the challenging party bears the burden of pointing to the specific items challenged, with a sufficient argument and citations to the evidence.¿ (Premier Medical Management Systems, Inc. v. California Ins. Guaranty Assoc. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 550, 564.)¿ General arguments that the fees claimed are excessive, duplicative, or unrelated do not suffice.¿ (Ibid.)¿¿ Civ. Code, section 1717Plaintiff first argues that attorney’s fees are authorized here under Civ. Code, section 1717 because the FACC arises from the escrow instructions which contain a provision providing that the prevailing party in any action relating to or arising out of the escrow transaction may recover reasonable attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses. (Motion, Exh. 1.) Civ. Code, section 1717 applies only to actions that contain at least one contract claim. (Santisas v. Goodin (1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 615.) If an action asserts both contract and tort or other noncontract claims, the section applies only to the fees incurred to litigate the contract claims. (Reynolds Metals Co. v. Alperson (1979) 25 Cal.3d 124, 129.) Whether an action is based on contract or tort depends on the nature of the right sued upon, not the form of the pleading or relief demanded. (Kangarlou v. Progressive Title Co., Inc. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1178, quoting Arthur L. Sachs, Inc. v. City of Oceanside (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 315, 322.) A cause of action arises from, is based on, or relates to a contract if it seeks to define or interpret its terms or determine or enforce a party’s rights or duties under the agreement. (Douglas E. Barnhart, Inc. v. CMC Fabricators, Inc. (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 230, 242.)A cause of action for fraud is not based on contract for the purposes of section 1717. (Reyes v. Beneficial State Bank (2022) 76 Cal.App.5th 596, 620.)Here, the FACC alleges a cause of action for fraud and a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The elements of fraud are: “(a) misrepresentation (false representation, concealment, or nondisclosure); (b) knowledge of falsity (or ‘scienter’); (c) intent to defraud, i.e., to induce reliance; (d) justifiable reliance; and (e) resulting damage.” (Charnay v. Cobert (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 170, 184.)Here, the FACC states that when Plaintiff agreed to sell the property to Griffith, she did not intend to sell the property but intended to defraud Griffith out of the sales proceeds through a quick escrow. (FACC ¶¶17-21.) The sale was part of a scam to trick Griffith into repairing and maintaining the property for free. (FACC ¶15.) Payton had engaged in similar scams to defraud purchasers of her other properties. (FACC ¶16.) As a result of Plaintiff’s misrepresentations, Griffith was induced to obtain a hard money loan to pay Plaintiff. (FACC ¶¶19-20.) Plaintiff intended to cause harm to Griffith. (FACC ¶23.) As a result of Plaintiff’s conduct, Griffith suffered severe emotional distress and mental anguish. (FACC ¶24.) The FACC does not appear to arise from the escrow transaction, but from Plaintiff’s initial agreement to sell the subject property to Griffith. The FACC does not seek to interpret the escrow instructions, nor does it seek to define Plaintiff’s or Griffith’s obligations under the escrow instructions. Rather, the FACC alleges Plaintiff misrepresented that she intended to sell Griffith the subject property and fraudulently induced Griffith to obtain a loan to pay Plaintiff. The primary rights at issue here are not Plaintiff’s or Griffith’s rights or obligations under the escrow instructions, but Griffith’s right to recover for Plaintiff’s alleged fraud. Likewise, the cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress is a tort and does not sound in contract. Therefore, Plaintiff is not entitled to attorney’s fees under Civ. Code, section 1717. Wel. and Inst. Code, section 1567.5(a)Plaintiff next argues that she is entitled to attorney’s fees under Wel. and Inst. Code, section 1567.5(a). The section reads as follows:“Where it is proven by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant is liable for financial abuse, as defined in Section 15610.30, in addition to compensatory damages and all other remedies otherwise provided by law, the court shall award to the plaintiff reasonable attorney's fees and costs. The term “costs” includes, but is not limited to, reasonable fees for the services of a conservator, if any, devoted to the litigation of a claim brought under this article.” Here, the FACC was dismissed after the Court sustained Plaintiff’s demurrer without leave to amend. Although Plaintiff’s Complaint includes a cause of action for elder abuse, Plaintiff’s claims have not been resolved on the merits and there has been no showing that Griffith is liable for financial abuse. Plaintiff is not entitled to attorney’s fees under Wel. and Inst. Code, section 1567.5(a) at this time.DATED:  June 4, 2024 _______________________Hon. Jill Feeney  Judge of the Superior Court
