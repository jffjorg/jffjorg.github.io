And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge has issued a tentative ruling on Defendant Shah Mukesh Chhotalal's motion to set aside the default/default judgment entered against him. The default was entered on February 26, 2024, and the default judgment was entered on June 26, 2024. The Defendant argues that his attorney's calendaring error caused the failure to file a timely answer, and that the affidavit of fault provided by his attorney is sufficient to meet the requirements of Code Civ. Proc. § 473(b). The Judge agrees and grants the motion, awarding the Plaintiff $1,000 in compensatory legal fees and costs. The Judge also notes that the Plaintiff's arguments that the attorney's mistake was not excusable or intentional are not sufficient to overcome the mandatory relief provisions of the Code.
