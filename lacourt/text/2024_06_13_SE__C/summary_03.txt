And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

"The court hereby grants the unopposed motion to deem requests for admissions (RFAs) admitted against the plaintiff, NATIONAL GROUP CONSTRUCTION & MANAGEMENT, INC. The plaintiff failed to provide any responses to the RFAs, which were propounded on or about April 8, 2024. As a result, the court grants the motion and orders the plaintiff and its counsel to pay sanctions in the amount of $643.65 within 90 days. The court also notes that the plaintiff's failure to respond to the RFAs was not the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and therefore, the court imposes mandatory monetary sanctions under CCP §2033.280(c)."
