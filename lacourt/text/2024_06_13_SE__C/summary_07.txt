And here is the English-text summary:

This tentative ruling denies Defendant Julia Weems' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff Brewer's Complaint without prejudice. The Motion was filed without opposition and lacked legal authority. The Court cannot render a decision on the merits of the case without a proper legal basis. The denial of the Motion does not bar Defendant from re-asserting the same arguments via a different procedural vehicle, such as a Demurrer, Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, or Motion for Summary Judgment. Additionally, Defendant is not barred from seeking an order to declare the Plaintiff a vexatious litigant under CCP §391, et seq.
