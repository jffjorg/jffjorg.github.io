[¶] Defendants… negligently installed  and/or maintained the floor of the second story of Defendants’ building,  leaving the floor of the second story to be unsecure and too unsafe to walk on,  so as to create a hazardous and dangerous condition. [¶] The hazardous and  dangerous condition posed by second story floor was known, or in the exercise  of ordinary and reasonable care would have been known, to Defendants, and each  of them, in adequate time for a reasonably prudent person to warn of, or to  repair and make safe, the dangerous and hazardous condition. [¶] As a proximate  result of the negligence of Defendants, Plaintiff sustained injury to his  person when he fell through the floor of the second story down to ground of the  first story of the subject premises.” (Complaint ¶¶9-12.)    Plaintiff’s  Complaint asserts the following causes of action:    (1) Negligence;  and  (2) Negligence:  Premises Liability    Relevant Procedural  History    ·       On March 16, 2023, the Court denied Defendant  K&M MEAT COMPANY, INC.’s (“Defendant”) Motion for Summary Judgment.  ·       On April 3, 2023, Defendant filed a Motion  for Reconsideration of its Motion for Summary Judgment.   ·       On July 26, 2023, Defendant delivered a CCP §  998 Offer to Compromise (“Offer”) for $60,000.00 to Plaintiff.  ·       On August 9, 2023, the Court heard and took  under submission Defendant’s Motion for Reconsideration of its Motion for  Summary Judgment.   ·       On August 16, 2023, Plaintiff accepted  Defendant’s CCP § 998 Offer.  ·        On  August 22, 2023, Plaintiff attempted to file a written acceptance of  Defendant’s CCP § 998 Offer (“Acceptance”), along with a proposed judgment, which  the Court RECEIVED. The Acceptance and proposed judgment were filed in this  Court, Dept. SE-C, where Defendant’s Motion for Reconsideration was under  submission.  However, under the Norwalk  Court’s master calendar system, proposed judgments are typically sent to Dept.  SE-F, the master calendar department, for review by Judge Rosales.  That is what happened here, unbeknownst to  this Court.   ·        On  August 25, 2023, this Court granted Defendant’s pending Motion for  Reconsideration of its Motion for Summary Judgment and its Motion for Summary  Judgment.   ·       On August 28, 2023, Defendant served  Plaintiff by email with its withdrawal and revocation of its Offer. ·       On August 29, 2023, Defendant filed an  Objection to Plaintiff’s Proposed Judgment Submitted in Conjunction with the  Offer to Compromise.  ·       On September 26, 2023, Judge Rosales, sitting  in Dept. SE-F, issued the following Order: “The Offer to Compromise and  Acceptance under Code of Civil Procedure Section 998 and proposed judgment are  denied.” (09/26/23, M.O.)  ·       On October 5, 2023, Plaintiff filed his  Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement pursuant to CCP §664.6 in Dept. SE-C. ·        On  February 29, 2024, the Court heard and denied without prejudice  Plaintiff’s Motion to Enforce Settlement. ·        On March  6, 2024, Plaintiff filed an ex parte application renewing his Motion to  Enforce Settlement or, alternatively, requesting reconsideration of the Court’s  denial of the motion without prejudice.   ·       On March 7, 2024, the Court on its own motion  scheduled Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration for hearing. (LeFrancois v.  Goel (2005) 35 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1107.) ·       On March 11, 2024, the Court requested  briefing on the following issue:  What  binding effect, if any, does Judge Rosales’s September 26, 2023 order have on  Plaintiff’s Motion to Enforce Settlement pending in this Court?  If Judge Rosales’s September 26, 2023 order  is binding upon this Court, should this Court allow Plaintiff an opportunity to  seek reconsideration before Judge Rosales? ·       On April 25, 2024, the Court heard arguments  on Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration of this Court’s February 29, 2024  Order and Plaintiff’s Renewed Motion to Enforce Settlement.  The Court took the matter under submission.   ·       On May 28, 2024, on the Court’s own motion, Judge  Olivia Rosales vacated her September 26, 2023 Order denying Plaintiff’s  Acceptance of Defendant K&M Meat Company, Inc.’s CCP § 998 Statutory Offer  to Compromise.  The matter was assigned  to this Court for review and ruling.     Merits   Plaintiff moves for  reconsideration of this Court’s February 29, 2024 Order, under CCP §664.6,  arguing that “entry of judgment in accordance with the terms of the settlement  agreement pursuant to [CCP §] 664.6 is not dependent on performance of the  terms of the settlement agreement.” (Motion 1:10-12.) To support this argument,  Plaintiff relies on a case not cited or argued in the initial Motion to Enforce  Settlement Agreement filed on October 5, 2023— Hines v. Lukes (2008) 167  Cal.App.4th 1174, 1184-1185. Plaintiff argues that Hines authorizes the  Court to enter judgment pursuant to the settlement regardless of whether the  settlement’s obligations were performed or excused. Plaintiff further argues  that “new facts” exist to warrant reconsideration under CCP §1008 because the  Court “adopted a position not advanced by either party” in its February 29,  2024 Order.    In Opposition,  Defendant argues: (1) Plaintiff’s Motion must be denied for failure to comply  with CCP §1008; (2) the Hines case does not apply because Plaintiff  cannot offer proof that he reached a resolution of the worker’s compensation  carrier’s lien on his recovery (which was a condition precedent to any  Settlement with Defendant); and (3) Plaintiff’s Proposed Judgment is inconsistent  with the Express Terms of Defendant’s Offer because the Offer called for  Plaintiff to file a dismissal of his claims against K&M and Mr. Goldberg,  rather than for entry of judgment.              Motion for Reconsideration   Under CCP §1008, the Court may entertain a motion for  reconsideration based on a showing of new or different facts, law, or  circumstances. (CCP §1008.)  “New or different facts” means facts that the  moving party could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered or produced  it earlier. (Baldwin v. Home Savings of America (1997) 59 Cal.App.4th  1192, 1198.) Under CCP §1008, the burden “is comparable to that of a party  seeking a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence: the information  must be such that the moving party could not, with reasonable diligence, have  discovered or produced it at the trial.” (New York Times Co. v. Superior  Court (Wall St. Network, Ltd. (2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 206, 212-213.) As a  result, a party seeking reconsideration must provide a satisfactory explanation  for failing to present the information at the first hearing, and motion for  reconsideration is properly denied where it is based on evidence that could  have been presented in connection with the original motion. (Garcia v.  Hejmadi (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 647, 690; Morris v. AGFA Corp. (2006)  144 Cal.App.4th 1452, 1460.)    Plaintiff does not  meet the statutory requirements for a motion for reconsideration.  Plaintiff does not explain why the Hines  case could not, with reasonable diligence, have been argued in the original  Motion to Enforce Settlement or at the February 29, 2024 hearing.    As indicated above, on  March 7, 2024, this Court scheduled Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration for  hearing under its inherent authority to do so under LeFrancois v. Goel  (2005) 35 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1107 (not CCP §1008).   Moreover, as the  parties are aware, this Court denied Plaintiff’s initial Motion to Enforce  Settlement Agreement without prejudice. Therefore, it was unnecessary  for Plaintiff to have moved for reconsideration of that Order, and the  statutory restrictions of CCP §1008 (e.g. different facts, law or  circumstances) do not apply. That being said, here, the procedural status of  the case has not changed. No Judgment has been entered, and no Request for  Dismissal with prejudice as to K&M Meat Company, Inc., Felix Goldberg  Trustee of the Felix Goldberg Trust, and Felix Goldberg has been filed/lodged  with this Court.    The Court shall  treat and construe Plaintiff’s arguments as a renewed Motion to Enforce the 998  Offer/Settlement, and not as a Motion for Reconsideration.              Renewed Motion to Enforce CCP §998  Offer/Settlement                        Section 664.6 is  Inapplicable    Under CCP §664.6, “If parties to a pending litigation  stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court  orally before the court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the  court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.  If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties  to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the  settlement.” (Id.)     Here, there is no 664.6 clause in the Offer. Moreover, no Notice  of Settlement was ever filed, and no dismissal was ever entered. Section 664.6  is inapplicable and this Court never lost jurisdiction over this case.    Plaintiff Timely  Accepted Defendant’s 998 Offer   Judgments entered pursuant to CCP  §664.6 are distinguishable from compromise settlements entered in accordance  with CCP §998.  Unlike a stipulated  judgment under section 664.6, “the court has no discretion to refuse to enter  judgment in a properly accepted statutory offer to settle pursuant to section  998. [Citation.]” (California State Auto. Assn. Inter-Ins. Burau v. Sup. Ct.  (1990) 50 Cal.3d 658, 665, fn. 3.)    The Offer requires  payment to Plaintiff in the sum of $60,000.00 in exchange for: Plaintiff’s  dismissal with prejudice of the Complaint as to K&M Meat Company, Inc.,  Felix Goldberg Trustee of the Felix Goldberg Trust, and Felix Goldberg;  Plaintiff’s agreement that each party bear their own fees and costs;  Plaintiff’s agreement that he satisfy any and all liens out of the proceeds  paid to him, including the workers’ compensation lien asserted by Falls Lake  Fire and Casualty Company; Plaintiff’s agreement that he will provide proof to  Defendant that any workers’ compensation, MediCal or Medicare liens have been  satisfied; Plaintiff’s agreement to release K&M Meat Company, Inc., Felix  Goldberg Trustee of the Felix Goldberg Trust, and Felix Goldberg from and  against any claims now asserted or alleged in the instant action; and  Plaintiff’s agreement, promise and covenant not to sue K&M Meat Company,  Inc., Felix Goldberg Trustee of the Felix Goldberg Trust, and Felix Goldberg  for any claims now asserted or alleged in the instant action or damages arising  out of the claims now asserted or alleged in the instant action.” (Bagumyan  Decl., ¶2, Ex. A.)   “Section 998,  subdivision (b)(2) states that the offer must be accepted within 30 days or it  is deemed withdrawn….” (Gray v. Stewart (2202) 97 Cal.App.4th 1394, 1398.)  Here, Plaintiff accepted Defendant’s Offer within 30 days. The Court has  reviewed the terms of the Offer and finds that any such conditions stated  therein are not expressly termed as conditions for acceptance. Rather, as  argued by Plaintiff, the conditions cited by Defendant in support of their Opposition  are terms of the Offer which Plaintiff must satisfy after acceptance. Thus, the  Offer and Acceptance form a fully executed Settlement Agreement between the  parties. To date, no notice of Settlement has been filed with the Court.   On August 22, 2023,  Plaintiff attempted to file a written acceptance of Defendant’s CCP § 998 Offer  (“Acceptance”), along with a proposed judgment, which the Court RECEIVED. The  Acceptance and proposed judgment were filed in this Court, Dept. SE-C, where  Defendant’s Motion for Reconsideration was under submission.  However, under the Norwalk Court’s master  calendar system, proposed judgments are typically sent to Dept. SE-F, the  master calendar department, for review by Judge Rosales.  That is what happened here, unbeknownst to  this Court.  Under the circumstances, sending  Plaintiff’s written acceptance to Dept. SE-F for review was a clerical  error.  The Acceptance and proposed  judgment should have been sent to this Court for review because this Court had  taken Defendant’s Motion for Reconsideration under submission and had not  issued a ruling yet.  Had this Court been  advised that Plaintiff had filed a written acceptance of Defendant’s § 998 offer on August 22, 2023, this Court  likely would have found that the parties had reached a fully executed  settlement agreement, rendering Defendant’s Motion for Reconsideration  moot.     Judge Rosales has  vacated her September 26, 2023 Order denying Plaintiff’s Acceptance of  Defendant K&M Meat Company, Inc.’s CCP § 998 Statutory Offer to Compromise, and the matter has been assigned to  this Court for review and ruling.  For  the reasons stated above, and to return the parties to their respective  positions when Plaintiff accepted Defendant’s § 998 offer, Plaintiff’s Acceptance is GRANTED.  This order is effective as of August 22,  2023, the date it was received by the Court.   Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration of this Court’s February  29, 2024 Order and Plaintiff’s Renewed Motion to Enforce Settlement are DENIED  as MOOT.  The Court’s February 29, 2024  Order denying Plaintiff’s Motion to Enforce Settlement is VACATED.  Plaintiff’s Motion to Enforce Settlement is  DENIED as MOOT.  The Court’s August 25,  2023 ruling granting Defendant’s Motion for Reconsideration of its Motion for  Summary Judgment and Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment is VACATED.  Defendant’s Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED  as MOOT.     A proposed judgment  was attached to Plaintiff’s acceptance documents.  However, Defendant’s § 998 Offer did not include any verbiage  pertaining to entry of judgment.  Thus,  the Proposed Judgment submitted by Plaintiff on August 22, 2023 is inconsistent  with the Offer.  Accordingly, the  Proposed Judgment is stricken.     Plaintiff argues  that since Defendant has failed to perform (i.e., pay Plaintiff $60,000.00  under the CCP §998 Offer) Plaintiff is entitled to entry of a judgment versus a  dismissal of the action. However, the Offer expressly states that voluntary  dismissal is to occur, not entry of a judgment.  Although CCP §998(b)(1) uses the phrase “enter  judgment”, a dismissal with prejudice is the equivalent to a judgment for  purposes of a valid 998 Offer. (On-Line Power, Inc. v. Mazur (2007)  1079, 1085.)  As the 998 Offer is a  contract, the parties govern the nature of the “judgment” to be entered. (Chinn  v. KMR Property Management (2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 175, 184.) The parties  can agree for the entry of judgment in favor of the plaintiff or for the  voluntary dismissal of the action. (Id.; Goodstein v. Bank of San  Pedro (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 899, 905-07.)   Having determined that the settlement agreement contemplates voluntary  dismissal, the Court schedules an OSC re Dismissal in 15 days.
