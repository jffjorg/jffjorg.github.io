CASE NO.: 24NWCV00420
HEARING:  06/13/24

Defendant JULIA WEEMS’ Motion to Dismiss is DENIED without prejudice. 
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
Defendant JULIA WEEMS (in pro per) (“Defendant”) moves to dismiss
Plaintiff’s Complaint for lack of merit and abuse of process. 
 
No Opposition has
been filed as of June 10, 2034.  
 
The motion is
DENIED.  The Court cannot render a
decision because Defendant has not provided the legal authority for her
motion.  CCP §581 explains when and how
dismissals may be sought. 
 
The denial of Defendant’s
Motion is without prejudice to Defendant from re-asserting these same arguments
via a different procedural vehicle—e.g. Demurrer, Motion for Judgment on the
Pleadings, or Motion for Summary Judgment. Similarly, Defendant is not barred
from seeking an order to declare the Plaintiff a vexatious litigant under CCP
§391, et seq.
