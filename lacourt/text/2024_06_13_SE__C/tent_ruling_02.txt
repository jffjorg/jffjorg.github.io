Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Deposition Questions 
 
Defendant HANNAH SEUING EUN AHN moves to compel further
responses from Plaintiff Erica Kim pursuant to CCP § 2025.480. There are 10
deposition questions at issue. Plaintiff Kim seemingly refused to answer many
of the subject questions citing privacy objections/concerns. 
 
This
matter was initially set for hearing on April 11, 2024, but continued to April
25, 2024 to enable Defendant the opportunity to respond to, and this Court to
adequately review, Plaintiff’s untimely filed Opposition papers. 
On
April 25, 2024, this Court continued the Motion for a second time and ordered
the parties to meet and confer, and file a Joint Statement outlining any
disputed issues by no later than Monday, June 3, 2024. 
 
An
untimely Joint Statement was filed on June 7, 2024. The untimely Joint
Statement indicates “the parties have not had an opportunity to further meet
and confer.” (JS 2:14.) 
 
This
matter is CONTINUED. Counsel are, once again, instructed to further meet and
confer on the issues outlined in the subject Motions. 
 
Counsel
are ORDERED to make further efforts
to resolve the issues presented. If, after exhausting those efforts, court
intervention is needed, counsel may appear and argue the merits on the
continued hearing date. If counsel are unable to informally resolve their
discovery disputes, then counsel are instructed to submit a JOINT STATEMENT
outlining the remaining disputed issues for which a ruling is required. The
joint statement must be FILED on or before Monday, August 26, 2024. 
 
Motion
to Compel Further Responses to Request for Production of Documents 
 
The
Opposition to this Motion was due by May 31, 2024. Without leave of Court,
Defendant filed an untimely Opposition on June 3, 2024. 
 
As
of June 11, 2024, no Reply has been filed. 
 
This
matter is CONTINUED as indicated above to ensure that Plaintiff has the ability
to review and respond to Defendant’s untimely Opposition. Plaintiff may file
and serve a Reply per Code in accordance with the new hearing date. 
 
Additionally,
the parties are also ORDERED to submit a Joint Statement. Counsel are ORDERED to make further efforts to
resolve the issues presented. If, after exhausting those efforts, court
intervention is needed, counsel may appear and argue the merits on the
continued hearing date. If counsel are unable to informally resolve their
discovery disputes, then counsel are instructed to submit a JOINT STATEMENT
outlining the remaining disputed issues for which a ruling is required. The
joint statement must be FILED on or before Monday, August 26, 2024.
