And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has granted monetary sanctions in the amount of $1,000.00 to the plaintiff due to the defendant's untimely compliance with the March 28, 2023 Order. The defendant failed to produce responses and documents on time, which is considered a misuse of the discovery process. The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for terminating sanctions, as the defendant has not completely abandoned their duties to respond to or comply with discovery obligations. The defendant's untimely production is not deemed sufficient to warrant terminating sanctions. The defendant is ordered to pay the monetary sanctions within 90 days of the court's issuance of this order.
