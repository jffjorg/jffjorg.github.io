And here is the English text to summarize the judge's tentative ruling:

The judge grants the plaintiff's unopposed application for a right to attach order against the defendant, Estela Vasquez. The plaintiff, Citibank, N.A., seeks a writ of attachment in the amount of $89,144.11, which is supported by the declaration of Scott D. Austin. The judge finds that the plaintiff's claim has probable validity, as it is more likely than not that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment against the defendant. The purpose of the attachment is to recover on the claim upon which the attachment is based, and the amount of the writ is the claimed indebtedness plus an amount to cover costs and allowable attorney fees. An undertaking of $10,000.00 is ordered as provided by statute.
