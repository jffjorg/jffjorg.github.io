Defendant
IGLESIA DE CRISTO MINISTERIOS LLAMADA FINAL, INC.’s unopposed Motion to Deem
RFA’s (set three) Admitted Against Plaintiff NATIONAL GROUP CONSTRUCTION &
MANAGEMENT, INC. is GRANTED. 
 
 
Moving
Party to give Notice. 
 
No
Opposition filed as of June 10, 2024
 
 
The
unopposed Motion to Deem Matters Admitted as to Defendant MANN INVESTMENT
GROUP, LLC (“Defendant”) is GRANTED. 
 
“If
a party to whom requests for admission are directed fails to serve a timely
response, the following rules apply: (a) The party to whom the requests for
admission are directed waives any objection to the requests…. The Court, on
motion, may relieve that party from this waiver on its determination that both
of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The party has subsequently
served a response that is in substantial compliance with Sections 2033.210,
2033.220, and 2033.230. (2) the party’s failure to serve a timely response was
the result of mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect…. (c) The court shall
make this order, unless it finds that the party to whom the requests for
admission have been directed has served, before the hearing on the motion, a
proposed response to the requests for admission that is in substantial
compliance with Section 2033.220. It is mandatory that the court impose a
monetary sanction under Chapter 7…on the party or attorney, or both, whose
failure to serve a timely response to requests for admission necessitated this
motion.” (CCP §2033.280.)  Unverified
responses “are tantamount to no responses at all.” (Appleton v. Superior
Court (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 632, 636.) No prior attempt to resolve the
matter informally is required. 
 
Here,
RFAs were propounded on or about April 8, 2024.  
 
To
the Court’s knowledge, Plaintiff has failed to provide any responses. 
 
Therefore,
the unopposed Motion is GRANTED. 
 
Sanctions
are mandatory pursuant to the terms of CCP §2033.280(c). 
 
Sanctions
are GRANTED as requested in the total amount of $943.65. Plaintiff NATIONAL
GROUP CONSTRUCTION & MANAGEMENT, INC. and its counsel of record are jointly
and severally ORDERED to pay Defendant and their counsel of record sanctions in
the total amount of $643.65, payable within 90 days from the date of the
Court’s issuance of this Order.
