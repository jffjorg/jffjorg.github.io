TRACY
CASE
NO.:  22NWCV00578
HEARING:  06/13/24
 
#10
 
Plaintiff’s
motion for terminating sanctions is DENIED. Alternatively, monetary sanctions are GRANTED in
the amount of $1,000.00. 
 
Moving
Party to give notice. 
 
This
matter was initially scheduled for, and heard on, Thursday, June 6, 2024. As of
June 6, 2024, no written Opposition had been filed with this Court. At the
hearing, Defense Counsel Bryan Castorina for Opposing Party/Defendant JULIE
REGINA TRACY (“Defendant”) appeared and stated that he suffers from an ailment
which causes him to experience lapses in memory. Mr. Castorina explained to the
Court that he had no recollection of the June 6, 2024 hearing being scheduled, which
is why he failed to file and serve an Opposition to the Motion. In an exercise
of its discretion, the Court granted Defendant leave to file an untimely
Opposition and this matter was CONTINUED to today’s date to be adjudicated on
the merits. 
 
The
Court has reviewed and considered Defendant’s Opposition filed June 10, 2024,
and Plaintiff’s Reply filed on June 11, 2024. 
 
CCP
§2023.010 includes: “(d) Failing to respond or to submit to an authorized
method of discovery.” CCP §2023.030 provides, in part: “To the extent
authorized by this chapter governing any particular discovery method or any
other provision of this title, the court, after notice to any affected party,
may impose the [sanctions] against anyone engaging in conduct that is a misuse
of the discovery process, including monetary and issue and terminating
sanctions.” Failing to respond to an authorized method of discovery and
disobeying a court order to provide discovery are both misuses of the discovery
process.” (CCP §§2023.010 (d) and (g).) Sanctions which may be imposed for a
misuse of the discovery process include “terminating sanctions.” 
 
Plaintiff
seeks terminating sanctions on the basis that Defendant is refusing to
participate in the discovery process. Specifically, Defendant has failed to
comply with this Court’s March 28, 2023 Discovery Order. 
 
In
Opposition, Defendant argues that the Motion should be denied because
responsive documents were untimely produced on March 18, 2024 at 1:21 p.m.
(Castorina Decl., ¶4, Ex. 3.) 
 
It
is a commonly stated axiom that discovery sanctions “should be appropriate to
the dereliction and should not exceed that which is required to protect the
interests of the party entitled to but denied discovery.” (Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978)
84 Cal.App.3d 771, 793.) However, a court is empowered to apply the ultimate
sanction against a litigant who persists in the outright refusal to comply with
discovery obligations. The refusal to reveal material evidence is deemed to be
an admission that the claim or defense is without merit. (Id. at 794-795.)

 
Given the arguments raised in Defendant’s untimely
Opposition,  the Court does not find that
terminating sanctions are warranted here because Defendant has not completely
abandoned their duties to respond to or comply with discovery/Court Orders. The
Court notes that the sufficiency of Defendant’s production are not properly
before the Court at this time. Therefore, the Court renders no opinion on the
sufficiency/lack of sufficiency of Defendant’s production. The Court merely
finds that Defendant responded.  
 
However,
the Court does find that further monetary sanctions are warranted due to
Defendant’s undisputed untimely compliance with the March 28, 2023 Order.
Specifically, the March 28, 2023 Order ordered Defendant to produce responses
and documents, without objections within 15 days from March 28, 2023. Untimely
responses were served approximately one year later, on March 18, 2024.  
 
Further monetary sanctions are GRANTED under CCP §2023.010(d) and
(g) in the amount of $1,000.00—payable by Defendant and Defendant’s Counsel of
Record Bryan Castorina to Plaintiff and their counsel of record within 90 days
of the Court’s issuance of this Order.  Plaintiff
is not foreclosed from seeking issue or evidentiary sanctions before the trial
judge.
