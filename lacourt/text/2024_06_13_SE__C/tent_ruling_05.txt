SPECIAL ADMINISTRATOR OF ESTATE OF ROSE MARY OLLISON, et al. vs ZEV BROOKS, et
al, Case No. 22NWCV00741
This is a legal
malpractice action. 
Defendants Zev
Brooks and the Law Offices of Zev Brooks apply ex parte application for an
order shortening time for a Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Answer Defendants’
Form Interrogatories, Set Two. 
A party may
seek ex parte relief upon an affirmative factual showing "irreparable
harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex
parte." (Cal. R. Ct. 3.1202(c).)
Defendants
contend they will irreparably harmed as the motion is currently set for
Tuesday, February 25, 2025, which is after the currently scheduled dates for
trial (November 22, 2024) and Motion for Summary Judgment ((July 31,
2024).  Defendants request a date no later than July 11, 2024. 
 
The Court finds
that Defendants would be harmed by not having their discovery motion heard
prior to the scheduled trial date.  The Court is unable to schedule a
hearing date before July 11, 2024.  
Accordingly,
Defendants Zev Brooks and the Law Offices of Zev Brooks’ ex parte application
for an order shortening time for a Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Answer to
Defendants’ Form Interrogatories, Set Two, is GRANTED. Defendants’ motion is
advanced to this date and CONTINUED to Tuesday August 27, 2024 at  9:30
a.m. in Department SE-C. 
Moving party to
give notice.
