The defendant, Los Angeles Unified School District, has moved to compel the plaintiff, Hassan Mateen, to submit to an independent mental examination (IME) to determine the nature and extent of his alleged psychological injuries. The plaintiff has opposed this motion, citing concerns about the scope and nature of the examination. The defendant has failed to comply with the relevant statutory requirements for the motion, including providing sufficient information about the examination and the qualifications of the examiner. As a result, the judge has denied the defendant's motion. The plaintiff has stipulated that no claim is being made for mental and emotional distress over and above that usually associated with the physical injuries claimed, and the defendant's attachment to the declaration of the defendant's counsel even provides the email sent by the plaintiff's counsel stipulating to the terms of California Code of Civil Procedure section 2032.320(c).
