Plaintiff’s
11/8/24 evidentiary objections to the Declaration of Robison (“Robison”) are

Background
On December 27, 2023, Plaintiff
filed her Complaint against Defendants alleging five causes of action: (1)
Violation of California Equal Pay Act (Labor Code §1197.5); (2) FEHA Sex
Discrimination (Gov. Code §12940(a)); (3) FEHA Retaliation (Gov. Code §12940(h));
(4) FEHA Failure to Prevent (Gov. Code §12940(k)); and (5) Private Attorneys’
General Act of 2004 (Labor Code §2698 et seq.).  On February 28, 2024, Defendants filed their
Anti-SLAPP Motion.
This Court heard argument on
the Anti-SLAPP Motion on May 30, 2024, and took the matter under submission.  On June 12, 2024, this Court issued its ruling
on submitted matter, granting Defendants’ Anti-SLAPP Motion in part and denying
in part.  (6/12/24 Minute Order.)  This Court denied Defendants’ motion as to
Plaintiff’s allegations in her FEHA Retaliation cause of action at ¶44 at pgs. 10:24-26,
11:5-7.  This Court granted Defendants’
motion as to the remaining factual allegations in Plaintiff’s FEHA Retaliation
cause of action.  (6/12/24 Minute Order
at pg. 1.)
On August 12, 2024, Defendants
filed the instant motion for attorneys’ fees. 
On November 8, 2024, Plaintiff filed her opposition.  As of the date of this hearing no reply has
been filed.
 
Discussion
C.C.P.
§425.16(c)(1) provides, in part, “a prevailing defendant on a special motion to
strike shall be entitled to recover that defendant’s attorney’s fees and costs.”  California law makes the award of attorneys’
fees and costs to a prevailing anti-SLAPP defendant mandatory.  (See Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th
1122, 1131 [“[u]nder Code of Civil Procedure §425.16, subdivision (c), any
SLAPP defendant who brings a successful motion to strike is entitled to
mandatory attorney’s fees.”].)  Here,
Defendants were the prevailing party in the Anti-SLAPP Motion.  (See 6/12/24 Minute Order.)  Accordingly, Defendants’ motion for
attorneys’ fees is proper and they are entitled to recover attorneys’ fees and
costs.
 
Reasonable Fees
The California Supreme Court has determined
the lodestar method is the proper mechanism to calculate attorneys’ fees under
C.C.P. §425.16(c).  (See Ketchum, 24 Cal.4th at pg. 1136.)  To calculate a
lodestar amount, the Court must first determine the reasonableness of the
hourly rates sought by Defendant’s counsel.  The “reasonable hourly rate” applicable under
the lodestar method is the rate “prevailing in the community for similar work.”
(PLCM Group v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)  “The trial court makes its determination
after consideration of a number of factors, including the nature of the
litigation, its difficulty, the amount involved, the skill required in its
handling, the skill employed, the attention given, the success or failure, and
other circumstances in the case.”  (Id. at pg. 1096.)
Defendants’ Counsel declares the following hourly
rates in this case: (1) Catherine Jung (Junior Associate) $437 per hour; (2)
Clint Robison (Partner) $1,057 per hour; and (3) Jessica Abreu (Junior
Associate $437 per hour).  (See Decl. of Robison ¶12, Exh. G at pg. 5 of 5; Motion, pg. 5.)[1]  The
Court determines based on its experience that Defendants’ Counsel’s hourly rate
is reasonable in their community of practice.
An anti-SLAPP motion is complex in nature and requires the
submission of declarations and evidence akin to a motion for summary judgment
or a preliminary injunction.  Defendants’ counsel declares the Anti-SLAPP Motion
required extensive evidence and argument as to why the retaliation claim arose
from petitioning activity including showing that the pre-litigation communications/representations
were in serious good faith anticipation of litigation.  (Decl. of Robison ¶4.)  Defendant’s Counsel further declares that the
motion also required considerable discussion as to why Plaintiff could not meet
her prima facie evidentiary burden of showing a probability of prevailing on
the merits of the retaliation cause of action.  (Decl. of Robison ¶4.)  Defendants’ counsel’s efforts resulted in the
dismissal of part of a cause of action alleged against them.  Accordingly, Defendants’ requested attorneys’
fees are ostensibly reasonable.
 
Billed Hours
The verified time entries of the attorneys
are entitled to a presumption of credibility, which extends to an attorney’s
professional judgment as to whether time spent was reasonably necessary to the
litigation.  (Horsford v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 359, 396 [“We think
the verified time statements of the attorney as officers of the court are
entitled to credence in the absence of a clear indication the records are
erroneous.”].)  “California courts do not
require detailed time records, and trial courts have discretion to award fees
based on declarations of counsel describing the work they have done and the
court’s own view of the number of hours reasonably spent.”  (Syers
Properties III, Inc. v. Rankin
(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 691, 698-699.)
“[A] defendant should not be entitled to
obtain as a matter of right his or her entire attorney fees incurred on
successful and unsuccessful claims merely because the attorney work on those
claims was overlapping. Instead, the court should first determine the lodestar
amount for the hours expended on the successful claims, and, if the work on the
successful and unsuccessful causes of action was overlapping, the court should
then consider the defendant’s relative success on the motion in achieving his
or her objective, and reduce the amount if appropriate.”  (Mann v. Quality Old Time Service, Inc.
(2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 328, 344-345.)  “This
analysis includes factors such as the extent to which the defendant’s
litigation posture was advanced by the motion, whether the same factual
allegations remain to be litigated, whether discovery and motion practice have
been narrowed, and the extent to which future litigation expenses and strategy
were impacted by the motion. The fees awarded to a defendant who was only partially
successful on an anti-SLAPP motion should be commensurate with the extent to
which the motion changed the nature and character of the lawsuit in a practical
way. The court should also consider any other applicable relevant factors, such
as the experience and abilities of the attorney and the novelty and difficulty
of the issues, to adjust the lodestar amount as appropriate.”  (Id. at pg. 345.)
Here, Defendants’ litigation posture was not
advanced by the motion and there was no meaningful change to the legal
landscape; Defendants’ motion merely struck a portion of the FEHA retaliation
claim based on a “settlement communication.”  (See 6/12/24 Minute Order, pgs. 8-11.)  Plaintiff’s possible recovery against
Defendants did not change, even pursuant to her cause of action for retaliation
under FEHA: Plaintiff still seeks “loss of wages,” “prejudgment interest,”
“emotional distress, humiliation, mental anguish and embarrassment, as well as
manifestations of physical symptoms,” “attorneys’ fees and costs,” and
“punitive damages.”  (Complaint ¶¶45-48.)
 This Court also did not strike
Plaintiff’s entitlement to any possible recovery.  Plaintiff continues to allege a retaliation claim
in her 1st cause of action under Labor Code §1197.5 (Complaint ¶¶26, 31) and
her possible recovery remains the same pursuant to her other causes of action
(Prayer for Relief ¶¶1-9, Complaint ¶¶32-34, 38-41, 51-54, 57).
Further, Defendants’ fee request is for a
total of $114,063.52.  This amount
of fees is comparable to the exorbitant fees in Christian Research Institute
v. Alnor.  In Christian Research
Institute, the Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court’s order to award
the prevailing Defendant in an anti-SLAPP motion only $21,300 in attorneys’
fees and $1,494.83 in costs, which was considerably less than the requested
fees of over $250,000.00 for over 600 hours of work.  (Christian Research Institute v. Alnor
(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 1315, 1319.) 
Here, like in Christian Research Institute, Defendants’ fee
request is “grossly inflated” and their billing records are excessively redacted.
 Based on these facts this Court can
“reasonably determine counsel’s fee request [is] unreasonably padded, vague,
and worthy of little credence.”  (Id.
at pg. 1326.)
Therefore,
the Court reduces Defendants’ requested billed fees by 2/3, resulting in a
reduced award of attorneys’ fees on the Anti-SLAPP Motion of $32,407.30,
calculated as follows:
1/3 x
$97,221.90 = $32,407.30
With regards to the instant motion for attorneys’ fees,
Defendants’ counsel requests attorneys’ fees for 10 hours, as well as 5 hours
to review of the opposition, prepare a reply, and appear at the hearing for the
instant motion.  (Decl. of Robison ¶17.)  The Court finds the requested 15 hours on the
instant motion to be appropriate. 
However, Defendants’ counsel does not provide an invoice or a
declaration stating which attorney billed for the instant motion.  Therefore, the Court applies a junior
associate’s rate and calculates the fees on the instant motion as follows: 15 x
$437/hour = $6,555.00 in attorneys’ fees.
Accordingly, the Court calculates the total reduced
attorneys’ fees to be $38,962.30.
 
Costs
Defendants request costs in the amount of $986.62.  Plaintiff does not challenge Defendants’
request for costs, and such costs are substantiated in Defendants’ invoices, as
they are not redacted, unlike the remainder of the invoices provided.  (See Decl. of Robison, Exh. G.)
Accordingly, Defendants’ request for costs incurred on the
Anti-SLAPP Motion is granted in the amount of $986.62.
 
Conclusion
Defendants’
motion for attorneys’ fees and costs is granted in the reduced total amount of
$39,948.92, comprised of $32,407.30 in
attorneys’ fees incurred on the Anti-SLAPP Motion, $6,555.00 in
attorneys’ fees incurred on the instant motion, and $986.62 in costs.
