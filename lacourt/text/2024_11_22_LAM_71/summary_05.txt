```

And here is the summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the plaintiff's request for a default judgment and instead has set a hearing to determine why the complaint should not be dismissed and/or the plaintiff's counsel should be sanctioned for failing to enter the default judgment. The hearing is scheduled for December 24, 2024, at 8:30 AM in Department 71 at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse.

The judge's decision is based on the fact that the plaintiff failed to provide exhibits to support their declaration of damages, and therefore, the percipient witness who would be competent to testify must lay the foundation for the exhibits. The plaintiff's failure to do so has resulted in the court's denial of the default judgment packet and the setting of a hearing to resolve the dispute.
