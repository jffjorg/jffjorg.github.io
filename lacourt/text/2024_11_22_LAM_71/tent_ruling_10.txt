[1] The Court is concerned by the fact that Defendants’
counsel’s invoices redact the hourly rates of counsel.  (See Decl. of Robison, Exh. G.)  These redactions appear suspect; if the rates
included on the invoices match the rates included in Defendants’ motion, there
should be no reason to redact these rates.
