Cross-Complainants Wessex Investments, LLC’s and ABP Parcel
6, LLC’s motion for leave to file a third amended cross-complaint is
denied without prejudice.
 
          Cross-Complainants
Wessex Investments, LLC (“Wessex”) and ABP Parcel 6, LLC (“ABP”) (collectively,
“Cross-Complainants”) moves for an order granting them leave to
file a third amended cross-complaint (“3XC”) to add further allegations and
explicitly seek relief pursuant to Business and Professions Code §7031(b) regarding
newly uncovered circumstances of certain contract construction work performed
by inadequately licensed subcontractors, and to dismiss the cause of action for
negligence.  (Notice
of Motion, pg. 2.)
          
          Procedural
Background
          Cross-Complainants
filed the initial cross-complaint (“XC”) on September 15, 2020.  Cross-Complainants filed their first amended
cross-complaint (“FAXC”) on February 9, 2022, per stipulation.  Cross-Complainants filed the operative second
amended cross-complaint (“SAXC”) on February 21, 2023, against Cross-Defendant
Griffith Company (“Griffith”) (“Cross-Defendant”): (1) breach of contract; and
(2) negligence.  (See SAXC.)
          Cross-Complainants
filed the instant motion on October 28, 2024. 
Cross-Defendant filed its opposition on November 8, 2024.  Cross-Complainants filed their reply on
November 15, 2024.
 
          Request
for Judicial Notice
          Cross-Defendant’s
11/8/24 request for judicial notice of the Notice of Completion recorded April
7, 2020, Los Angeles County Recorder No. 20200393100 (CD-RJN, Exh. G), is granted.
Cross-Defendant’s 11/8/24 request for judicial notice of
the XC, FAXC, and SAXC filed in the instant matter is denied because the Court
does not need to take judicial notice of filings on the instant docket.
 
Motion for Leave to Amend
“The
court may, in furtherance of justice, and on any terms as may be proper, allow
a party to amend any pleading or proceeding by adding or striking out the name
of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake
in any other respect; and may, upon like terms, enlarge the time for answer or
demurrer. The court may likewise, in its discretion, after notice to the
adverse party, allow, upon any terms as may be just, an amendment to any
pleading or proceeding in other particulars; and may upon like terms allow an
answer to be made after the time limited by this code.”  (C.C.P.
§473(a)(1).) 
“Trial
courts are vested with the discretion to allow amendments to pleadings ‘in
furtherance of justice.’ That trial courts are to liberally permit such
amendments, at any stage of the proceeding, has been established policy in this
state since 1901.”  (Hirsa v. Superior Court (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d
486, 488-489.) 
CRC
Rule 3.1321(a) requires that a motion to amend must: “[i]nclude a copy of the
proposed . . . amended pleading . . . [and] state what allegations in the
previous pleading are proposed to be [deleted and/or added], if any, and where,
by page, paragraph, and line number, the [deleted and/or additional]
allegations are located.”  (CRC Rule 3.1321(a).)
CRC
Rule 3.1324(b) provides, as follows: “[a] separate declaration must accompany the motion and must specify: (1) [t]he effect of the
amendment; (2) [w]hy the amendment is necessary and proper; (3) [w]hen the
facts giving rise to the amended allegations were discovered; and (4) [t]he
reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier.”  (CRC Rule
3.1324(b), emphasis added.)
Cross-Complainants’
motion substantially complies with CRC Rule 3.1324(a).  The motion
includes a copy of the proposed TAXC.  (Decl. of Taran ¶4, Exh. B.)   Cross-Complainants’
counsel’s declaration fails to set forth the allegations proposed to be added
and deleted, and where, by page, paragraph, and line number.  (See Decl. of Taran.)  However, Cross-Complainants’ counsel attaches
a redlined version of the TAXC demonstrating where allegations were added and
deleted compared to the operative SAXC.  (See Decl. of Taran ¶3, Exh. A.)
Cross-Complainants’
motion does not substantially comply with CRC Rule 3.1324(b).  Cross-Complainants’ counsel’s declaration
fails to specify the effect of the amendments and explain why the amendments are
necessary and proper, when the facts giving rise to substantive amended
allegations were discovered, and why the request for amendment was not made
earlier.  (CRC Rule 3.1324(b); see Decl. of Taran.)
Based
on the foregoing, Cross-Complainants’ motion for leave to amend their SAXC and
file the proposed TAXC is denied, without prejudice.  
 
          Conclusion
Cross-Complainants’
motion for leave to amend their SAXC and file the proposed TAXC is
denied, without prejudice.
          Moving Party to give notice.
