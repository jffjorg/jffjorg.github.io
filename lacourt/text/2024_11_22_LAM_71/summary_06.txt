And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge's tentative ruling grants plaintiff Elaine Lau's unopposed motion to deem admitted the truth of the matters specified in her Requests for Admission (RFA) propounded on six pro per defendants: Edward Tham, Red Vault Investments LLC, Milkhouse Investors, LLC, Rene Carmen Jaime, Remi I. Jaime, and Investored LLC. The court finds that each defendant has failed to respond to the RFA, and therefore deems admitted the truth of the matters specified in their responses. The court also awards sanctions against each defendant in the amount of $173.33, payable within 20 days of this order. The sanctions are calculated as follows: ($400 per hour x 1.2 hours to prepare motion) + ($400 per hour x 0.5 hours to attend hearing) + $60 filing fee.
