And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge has denied the motion for leave to file a third amended cross-complaint (3XC) by Cross-Complainants Wessex Investments, LLC and ABP Parcel 6, LLC without prejudice. The motion was denied because the proposed 3XC did not substantially comply with California Rules of Court (CRC) Rule 3.1324(a) and (b). Specifically, the declaration accompanying the motion failed to specify the effect of the amendments, explain why the amendments were necessary and proper, and provide the reasons why the request for amendment was not made earlier. The judge noted that the motion was granted in part, as the request for judicial notice of the Notice of Completion recorded April 7, 2020, was granted.
