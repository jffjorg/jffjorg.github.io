And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

The judge grants Defendants' motion for attorneys' fees and costs in the reduced total amount of $39,948.92. The motion was made in response to the Anti-SLAPP Motion, which was filed by Defendants and was granted in part and denied in part. The judge calculates the attorneys' fees and costs as follows: $32,407.30 in attorneys' fees incurred on the Anti-SLAPP Motion, $6,555.00 in attorneys' fees incurred on the instant motion, and $986.62 in costs.

The judge reduces the requested attorneys' fees by 2/3, citing the California Supreme Court's determination that the lodestar method is the proper mechanism to calculate attorneys' fees under C.C.P. §425.16(c). The judge also notes that the requested fees are "grossly inflated" and that the billing records are excessively redacted.

The judge finds that the requested 15 hours on the instant motion to be appropriate, but notes that the counsel does not provide an invoice or a declaration stating which attorney billed for the instant motion. The judge applies a junior associate's rate and calculates the fees on the instant motion as follows: 15 x $437/hour = $6,555.00 in attorneys' fees.

The judge concludes that the motion for attorneys' fees and costs is granted in the reduced total amount of $39,948.92.
