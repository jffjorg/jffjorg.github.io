And here is the English-text summary:

This is a tentative ruling from Judge C Alexis L. regarding a motion to compel filed by the defendant, Norwalk/La Mirada Unified School District. The plaintiff, Alexis L., alleges sexual abuse and harassment by teacher Scott Waln during the 2019-2020 school year. The defendant seeks an order compelling the plaintiff to sign authorizations for release of medical records, have her treating physicians release records, or be excluded from claiming mental distress damages. The court denies the motion, finding that there is no authority for compelling the plaintiff to sign an authorization or exclude her from claiming damages. The court also notes that the defendant could have subpoenaed the records from the medical providers itself rather than seeking to compel the plaintiff.
