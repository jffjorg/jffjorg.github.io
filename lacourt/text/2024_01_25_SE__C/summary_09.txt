And here is a summary of the judge's tentative ruling in English text:

In this "lemon law" action, the defendant, SHAYCO, INC., has demurred to the plaintiff's third cause of action for Negligent Repair. The court finds that the economic loss rule bars the plaintiff's recovery under this cause of action, as the plaintiff does not allege that the defendant engaged in any intentional misconduct or made any affirmative misrepresentations. The court sustains the demurrer with 15 days' leave to amend. The hearing date for this matter is set for January 25, 2024.
