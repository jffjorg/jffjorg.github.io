Defendant BARRETT DAFFIN FRAPPIER
TREDER & WEISS, LLP’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is GRANTED
without leave to amend. 
 
Moving Party to give notice. 
 
Defendants JEANNETTE VILLEGAS and HECTOR VILLEGAS’
(“Villegas Defendants”) Joinder to Defendant BARRETT DAFFIN FRAPPIER TREDER
& WEISS, LLP’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is DENIED. The Villegas
Defendants and the Moving Defendant are not similarly situated. It is unclear
how the arguments applicable to the Moving Defendant would also identically
apply to the Villegas Defendants, and the Villegas Defendants fail to assist
the Court in understanding how the arguments raised by the Moving Parties can be
attributed to the Villegas Defendants as well. The Villegas Notice of Joinder
merely states: “[The Villegas Defendants] hereby join in the MOTION FOR
JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS filed by Barrett Daffin Frappier Treder & Weiss,
LLP… on the gourds that the Complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute
any cause of action against any defendants.” (Joinder 1:26-2:2.)  
 
“All papers opposing a motion so noticed shall be filed with
the court and a copy served on each party at least nine court days… before the
hearing.” (CCP §1005(b).) Consequently, Plaintiff’s Opposition and the papers
filed in conjunction thereto, were due to be filed and served by no later than January
11, 2024. However, Plaintiff’s Opposition Request for Judicial Notice were
untimely filed without leave of court on January 19, 2024 (only four court days
before the hearing). Plaintiff has a history of submitting late-filed papers
with this Court. Therefore, the Court exercises its discretion under CRC Rule
3.1300(d) to disregard the late-filed Opposition. 
 
A motion for judgment on the pleadings has the same function
as a general demurrer, and the rules governing demurrers apply. 
 
This action for
quiet title was filed by Plaintiff JOEL M. TORRES (pro per) (“Plaintiff”) on
July 27, 2021. 
 
Plaintiff alleges that on “January 29, 2020 Defendant BDFTW
as TRUSTEE the alleged SUBSTITUTE TRUSTEE purported to conduct an illegal and
unauthorized foreclosure sale of Plaintiff’s PROPERTY…. [¶] Plaintiff… alleges,
that said foreclosure sale of the PROPERTY was in FACT PREMATURE, or was
conducted in a manner not comporting with applicable law, in violation of
conditions precedent, and that the putative result thereof was that Defendants
JEANNETTE VILLEGAS, HECTOR VILLEGAS allegedly ‘took’ title to the PROPERTY,
under auspices of a void writing entitled ‘TRUSTEE’S DEED UPON SALE’.”
(Complaint ¶¶49-50.) “Defendant BARRETT DAFFIN FRAPPIER, TREDER & WEISS,
was a business enterprise operating as a professional substitute trustee in
regard to conducting non-judicial foreclosure within the State of California.”
 
Plaintiff’s Complaint asserts the following causes of
action: (1) Wrongful Foreclosure; (2) Cancellation of Instrument; (3) Quiet
Title; (4) Violation of Homeowner Bill of Rights Cal. Civ. Code §2924(f); (5)
Violation of Homeowner Bill of Rights Cal. Civ. Code §2923.5; (6) Violation of
Bus. & Prof. Code §17200; and (7) Preliminary Injunction. 
 
Defendant BARRETT DAFFIN FRAPPIER TREDER & WEISS, LLP
(“Defendant” or “BDFTW”) moves for judgment on the pleadings as to all causes
of action asserted against it in Plaintiff’s Complaint—which include the first,
second, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh causes of action. The third cause of
action is not directed towards BDFTW. 
 
First Cause of Action – Wrongful Foreclosure 
 
“The elements of a wrongful foreclosure cause of action are:
(1) the trustee or mortgagee caused an illegal, fraudulent, or willfully
oppressive sale of real property pursuant to power of sale in a mortgage or
deed of trust; (2) the party attacking the sale was prejudiced or harmed; and
(3) in cases where the trustor or mortgagor challenges the sale, the trustor or
mortgagor tendered the amount of the secured indebtedness or was excused from
tendering.” (Sciarratta v. U.S. Bank Natl. Assn. (2016) 247 Cal.App.4th
552, 562.) 
 
Plaintiff’s wrongful foreclosure claim is based on his
contention that Chase lacked authority to foreclose because the Assignments are
void. (FAC §54 (d)-(i).) However, Plaintiff
does not have standing to challenge the assignments. Yvanova v. New Century
Mortg. Corp. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 919 held that a borrower has
standing to challenge an assignment post-foreclosure only where the defect in
the assignment renders the assignment void rather than voidable. In Saterbak
v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 808, 815, the court
held that such an assignment is merely voidable, not void, and that the
borrower lacks standing to challenge the assignment. “Yvanova expressly offers no opinion as to whether, under New York
law, an untimely assignment to a securitized trust made after the trust's
closing date is void or merely voidable. (Id.
at pp. 940–941, 199 Cal.Rptr.3d 66, 365 P.3d 845.) We conclude such an
assignment is merely voidable. (See Rajamin
v. Deutsche Bank Nat'l Trust Co. (2d Cir.2014) 757 F.3d 79, 88–89 [“the
weight of New York authority is contrary to plaintiffs' contention that any
failure to comply with the terms of the PSAs rendered defendants' acquisition
of plaintiffs' loans and mortgages void as a matter of trust law”; “an
unauthorized act by the trustee is not void but merely voidable by the
beneficiary”].) Consequently, Saterbak lacks standing to challenge alleged
defects in the MERS assignment of the DOT to the 2007–AR7 trust.”  (Id.) Plaintiff urges the Court to
follow Glaski v. Bank of America, N.A. (2013) 128 Cal.App.4th 1079.
However, Glaski has been highly criticized. After Glaski was
decided, the New York trial court’s decision on which Glaski relied was
overturned. (Mendoza v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th
802. 812.) 
 
Moreover, to the extent Plaintiff is attempting to allege
that the Assignments are void because they were robo-signed by MERS—
allegations regarding “robo-signing” would render the assignment voidable and
not void. (See Maynard v. Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A., 2013 WL 4883202, at *9 (S.D. Cal. 2013).         
 
Based on the allegations of the Complaint and the judicially
noticeable documents, it is unclear how the assignments are void. 
 
The Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as to the first
cause of action is GRANTED without leave to amend. 
 
Second Cause of Action – Cancellation of Instruments
 
The elements of a cause of action for instrument
cancellation are (1) a written instrument; (2) a reasonable apprehension that
it may cause serious injury to someone; (3) as to whom it is void or voidable.
(Cal. Civ. Code §3412.)
 
The Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings to the second cause
of action is GRANTED without leave to amend for the same reasons noted in the
Court’s analysis under the First Cause of Action. Plaintiff has not
successfully alleged that the Assignments at issue are void. 
 
Fourth
Cause of Action – Violation of Homeowner Bill of Rights Cal. Civ. Code
§2924(f)
 
Section 2924.12(b) provides:   
After a trustee’s deed upon sale has been recorded,
a mortgage servicer, mortgagee, trustee, beneficiary, or authorized agent shall
be liable to a borrower for actual economic damages pursuant to Section
2923.55, 2923.6, 2923.7, 2924.9, 2924.10, 2924.11, or 2924.17 by that mortgage
servicer, mortgagee, trustee, beneficiary, or authorized agent where the
violation was not corrected and remedied prior to the recordation of the
trustee’s deed upon sale.   
 
Section 2924 sets forth requirements
regarding the Notice of Default.  Among
other things, that section provides in relevant part:  “(f) With respect to residential real
property containing no more than four dwelling units, a separate document
containing a summary of the notice of default information in English and the
languages described in Section 1632 shall be attached to the notice of default
provided to the mortgagor or trustor pursuant to Section 2923.3.”  Spanish is a language described in Section 1632.
 
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants failed to
comply with the requirements of Section 2924(f) by failing “to notify Plaintiff
of any action taken against his property in Plaintiff’s language.” (Complaint
¶121.) 
 
To state a claim for a violation of a
statute, facts sufficient to establish every element must be pleaded with
particularity.  (See, e.g., Covenant
Care, Inc. v. Superior Court (2004) 32 Cal. 4th 771, 790
(general rule is that “statutory causes of action must be pleaded with
particularity.”))  Here, with respect to
the claim that Defendants or their agents failed to engage in sufficient
efforts to communicate with the Plaintiff, the Complaint fails to allege specific
facts regarding whether and how Defendants or their agents attempted to
communicate with Plaintiff or otherwise engaged in due diligence.  
 
Further, the remedy provisions of HBOR
provide remedies only for “material” violations.  (See,
e.g., Coury v. Caliber Home
Loans, Inc., 2016 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS 164512 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 29, 2016). 
Moreover, where, as here, the foreclosure has already occurred, recovery
is limited to actual economic injury. The
Complaint fails to allege facts with specific particularity regarding the
materiality of this violation or how the alleged violation caused actual
economic injury.  
 
The Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as
to the Fourth Cause of Action is GRANTED without leave to amend. 
 
Fifth
Cause of Action – Violation of Cal. Civ. Code §2923.5
 
“A borrower may state a cause of action under [Civil Code]
section 2923.5 by alleging the lender did not actually contact the borrower or
otherwise make the required efforts to contact the borrower despite a contrary declaration
in the recorded notice of default. (Rossberg v. Bank of America, N.A.
(2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1481, 1494.) However, for violation of Cal. Civ. Code
§2923.5, “the sole available remedy is ‘more time’ before a foreclosure sale
occurs. After the sale, the statute provides no relief.” (Stebley v. Litton
Loan Servicing, LLP (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 522, 526.) Here, the foreclosure
sale has already occurred. Therefore, a remedy under Cal. Civ. Code §2923.5 is
not available. The Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as to the Fifth Cause
of Action is GRANTED without leave to amend. 
 
Sixth Cause of Action – Unfair Competition
 
To state a claim under §17200, a Plaintiff must
allege whether the conduct complained of is a fraudulent, unlawful or an unfair
business practice. To bring a claim under the fraud prong, Plaintiff must
allege an affirmative misrepresentation, conduct or business practice on the
part of a defendant; or an omission in violation of defendant’s duty to
disclose; and that is likely to deceive members of the public. (Buller v.
Sutter Health (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 981, 986.) To state a claim under the
unfairness prong, Plaintiff must allege that one or more of Defendant’s
business practices are unfair, unlawful or fraudulent; and the remedy sought is
authorized by law. (Paulus v. Bob Lynch Ford, Inc. (2006) 139
Cal.App.4th 659, 676; see also Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court (2011) 51
Cal.4th 310, 337.) To state a claim under the unlawful prong, Plaintiff must
allege a violation of law and cite that law. (Graham v. Bank of America,
N.A. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 594, 610 [demurrer to SAC which failed to
allege violation of a law was properly sustained without leave to amend].)  
 
In light of the Court’s rulings above, the Motion
for Judgment on the Pleadings as to the Sixth Cause of Action is GRANTED
without leave to amend.  
 
Seventh Cause of Action
– Preliminary Injunction  
 
A preliminary
injunction is a remedy, not a cause of action. “[A] preliminary injunction may
be sought only when the underlying cause of action on which the provisional
remedy rests is presented for decision through the pleadings.” (Dept. of
Fair Employment and Housing v. Sup. Ct. of Kern County (2020) 54
Cal.App.5th 356, 384.) Consequently, and given the Court’s analyses pertaining
to the causes of action above, the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as to
the Seventh Cause of Action is GRANTED without leave to amend.
