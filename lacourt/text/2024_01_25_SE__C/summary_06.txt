And here is the summary in English text:

This is a tentative ruling by the judge on the Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Further Responses to Requests for Production (set one). The Plaintiff, Juana Nunez-Hernandez, is seeking to compel the Defendant, Ralphs Grocery Company, to provide additional information related to a slip and fall incident. The Defendant is opposing the motion, arguing that the information is protected by attorney-client and work product privileges.

The judge has denied the Plaintiff's motion, finding that the Defendant has made a prima facie claim of privilege. The judge agrees with the Defendant that the dominant purpose of the relationship between the parties is one of attorney-client, and therefore the communication is protected by the privilege. The burden then shifts to the Plaintiff to establish that the communication was not confidential or that the privilege does not apply, which the Plaintiff has failed to do.

Accordingly, the Defendant's claim of privilege is sustained, and the Plaintiff's motion to compel further responses is denied.
