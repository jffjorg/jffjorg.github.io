The court has issued a tentative ruling granting the ex parte application to continue the action on behalf of the deceased plaintiff, Priscilla Olaes. The application was filed by Emmanuel Olaes, Roslyn Granger, and the Olaes Family Trust, which are the beneficiaries of the loan documents. The court found that the loan documents specify that the loans are to be made payable to the respective parties, including Emmanuel Olaes and Roslyn Granger, and the Olaes Family Trust. As a result, the court has appointed the successor in interest, Emmanuel Olaes, as a special administrator or guardian ad litem to continue the action. The court's decision is based on California Code of Civil Procedure sections 377.21 and 377.33, which provide that a pending action does not abate by reason of the death of a party if the cause of action survives.
