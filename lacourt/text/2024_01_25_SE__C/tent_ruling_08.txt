Plaintiff’s Demurrer to Defendant COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES’
Answer is OVERRULED in part and SUSTAINED in part without leave to amend in
part.   
 
Opposing Party to give notice. 
 
This discrimination
action was filed on July 14, 2023. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant COUNTY OF
LOS ANGELES (“County” or “Defendant”) lacked probable cause to arrest Plaintiff
for a violation of the Vehicle Code §10851(A). The Complaint asserts the
following causes of action: 
 
(1)
Violation
of Civil Rights for Unlawful Seizure and Arrest; 
(2)
Violation
of Civil Rights: Entity Liability; 
(3)
False
Arrest/False Imprisonment in Violation of Penal Code §236; 
(4)
Negligence;
and 
(5)
Government
Code Violation. 
 
On August 14, 2023 Defendant County filed the subject Answer (“Answer”)
to Plaintiff’s Complaint. In it’s Answer, Defendant asserts a general denial,
and ten affirmative defenses. 

Plaintiff now demurs to Defendant’s First-Tenth Affirmative Defenses, arguing
that the County’s affirmative defenses are no more than legal theories or
conclusions of law. 
 
CCP §430.20(a) states that a demurrer to an Answer is
properly sustained where, “[t]he answer does not state facts sufficient to
constitute a defense.” (Id.) 
However, it is well-settled than an answer alleging affirmative defenses
need only plead ultimate facts (e.g. Welch v. Derian (1964) 224
Cal.App.2d 750, 754) and there is a fine line between ultimate facts and mere
conclusions of law. (See, e.g., Bank of Italy v. Wetzel (1927) 82
Cal.App.240, 243.) Moreover, the sufficiency of an answer is considered in the
context of the allegations of the complaint. (South Shore Land Co. v.
Petersen (1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 725, 733.)
 
Here, the court determines that the County’s affirmative defenses are
sufficient when considered in the context of the allegations in the
Complaint.  Moreover, there is no
prejudice to these affirmative defenses since any residual uncertainty in the
pleading can be resolved through discovery. The demurrer is OVERRULED as to the
first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth seventh, ninth, and tenth affirmative
defenses.
 
In Opposition, the County states: “As to the Eighth Affirmative Defense,
it appears this is not [a] viable affirmative defense because Plaintiff filed a
Claim for Damages.” (Opp. 7:9-10.) Therefore, the demurrer is SUSTAINED without
leave to amend as to the eighth affirmative defense.
