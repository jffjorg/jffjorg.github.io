And here is the English-text summary:

The Judge, Hon. Michelle C. Kim, has issued a tentative ruling denying the motion to be relieved as counsel filed by Jason J. Buccat, attorney for plaintiff Luis Morales, without prejudice. The motion was filed on June 5, 2024, and later amended on July 24, 2024. However, the amended motion was filed and served six court days prior to the hearing, in violation of CCP §1005(b). Additionally, there were issues with the service on the plaintiff, including the lack of a declaration regarding the currentness of the plaintiff's email address for electronic service. The Judge has ordered the moving counsel to give notice and has set out procedures for parties to submit on the tentative ruling or appear at the hearing.
